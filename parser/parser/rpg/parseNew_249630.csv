Early Access Review
								This is a review for the build up to this point. I will write something more comprehensive when it's at release. This game has an absolutely fantastic shell for a great game. The gameplay feels wonderful, the textures and visuals are top notch, the simplistic yet addictive item/loot/stats systems all work. The random generation of worlds is passable (although still could about ten times as many prefab chunks. HOWEVER.It's extremely light on content. I don't know if that's because they are leaving that to last, however i blew though this game in 18 minutes. And I did not rush. I did die about 20 times before I finished it, so my total playtime is a few hours. That is still absolutely horrible compared to ANY other game of this type out there. Even very cheaply made games like rouge shooter have 100 times more content than this game. It needs more levels. Bigger levels. More items, more scaling. Etc. It's like a demo version of a game. And I am kind of scared that they are just going to tweak systems until release, instead of releasing actual game length. The game needs to be streatched across a wider canvas, make the drops scale very slowly upwards, make the levels huge with multi areas leading to the floor down, so we can explore sprawling levels if we wish, instead of these tinny little dungeons. Right now, because this game has the core mechanics of a 10/10 indie game. I am going to recommend this game. However if the content is the same as it is now, at release. Then I'll be changing my recommendation.			"

Early Access Review
								Amazing mix of a 2D Dungeon RPG (think Link to the Past for SNES) and Doom. The game starts you with a random inventory (one weapon, one food, one magic item, and some gold) and you can talk to a few NPCs to hear about the dangerous dungeon ahead. You head inside and explore the dungeon killing enemies and collecting progressively better loot until eventually, you die. When you respawn, thinking that all hope is lost, you realize that your gold from your previous life is still with you. You also realize, going into the dungeon, that it's different each time. The Camp where the npcs live in the beginning has many shops and the dungeon is endless and randomly generated. You can collect and save your gold to buy better loot in the town or just find as much as you can before you're killed in the dungeon. No matter how you play, delver is a great, addictive, cheap and fun retro dungeon-adventure game that everyone should play ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OTHER REASONS TO BUYEpic Pixel GraphicsLevel EditorStill in Beta (so much more to come)its CHEAP (4 dollars when i bought it, normally 8)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EVERYONE TRY DELVER!

								EDIT Jul 21, 2016: The developers are still working on the game, it has not been abandoned as many users fear. You can follow @joshuaskelly on Twitter for more frequent mini-updates about the progress of the game.Delver is a fun roguelike with a lot of potential. Still has some kinks and bugs that need ironing out, some balancing issues, et cetera, but it's Early Access for a reason, so you shouldn't let that deter you much. The game also comes with the easy-to-use editor to make your own areas/levels for the creative types. You should definitely give this game a try if you're into roguelikes.			"

								This game is amazing. Been playing it since it was in it's Alpha stages and was free and since then this game has improved A TON. Every run is randomly generated and you never know what you're going to find or have to go up against. Every level you go gets harder and harder and if you don't have very good gear or arnt leveled up alot, then you're not going to last very long (Especially on the trip back.) The replayability of this game is great too. It hasnt gotten old and I have yet to beat it. (The trip back is extremely hard if you don't have alot of HP pots, Good wands and really good armor.) I give it a 9/10. Definitely worth my $8.PS: This game is still in beta, but the Devs seem to have some great ideas coming up like shops, more levels, classes and other things. So if you're worried about content, stop worrying. There's alot more to come and this game has a ton of potential.EDIT: (11/30/2014) The game is still being updated and is still improving drastically. With the addition of 2 hand slots and destructable boxes along with a ton of new room layouts (Namely the caves, they've been completely re-done to look 100 times better.) Everything i've said before still stands and i'd still reccomend getting this. It's a great buy!			"

Early Access Review
								I'm no fan of early access games, but actually, this one is a definite exception to the rule. I got this in the Roguelike 2 Humble Bundle (so it was something like £4 for this and other rougelikes), but this was the game I was looking forward to. I'll quickly list some pros, cons, and then my experience.Pro:• Really good combat system with a focus on timing (nice balance of annoying bats and poison worms, and non-annoying enemies).• Levelling up and getting loot works well. You sometimes get a rare piece of kit, which makes you feel like god for a few floors.• Very attractive game (although there  could be a little room for improvement in some of the room details), chunky pixels are officially cool. The first, second and final themes work really well. The third theme is a little pedestrian - and so dark you just can't see anything in it.• Music is great, very fitting but not in-your-face-y.Con:• Foremost: almost all of the game is just so dark. There needs to be a 'Scroll of Light', or an update making the Candle light up the world a little more. In the third 'theme' (I won't spoil it), it's so dark that you often can't see any monsters, especially as only a few pixels aren't hiding in the water.• Jesus christ, the poison goes on for years.• Very little point in not choosing to level up HP when you get the choice. I went from 8HP to 38HP (ish) in one run-through, and if you wear the armour you just find, you basically don't need to worry. If you don't, then the poison (above) will easily kill you.• No way to block with your shield? And also, 2handed weapons don't seem to do any more damage, to make up for not having a shield? And - equipping books as a shield feels like it should do something, but no notes anywhere make it clear what (if anything) having a book equipped does.• Regardless of the above things: I finished the game in my first run-through. If you can't be bothered (e.g. at the end of the fourth 'theme'), you can simply run past enemies and take negligible damage - less so than you would if you tried to fight it, especially seeing regen items are so rare.• And least importantly: this game is evidently unfinished. I understand it's a roguelike, but it does need a bit more content. If you could fetch the orb, run back to base, then go on another mission (assuming the orb unlocks a 'new' dungeon), that would be cool. Or challenges, modifiers, things to unlock, weapons to start with, etc., that would be awesome. I just feel like I couldn't play through it again. Maybe levelling up should unlock cool spells, or something similar? I don't feel like I need to grind or farm in the dungeon to look for some awesome and rare loot that makes me godlike. It needs something rare like that, or something that unlocks. In my opinion, that's how Risk of Rain is just infinitely replayable.TL/DR: I still would totally play it again, but it's relatively easy to finish in the first play-through. This game is already good, and I'm assuming it'll be great by the time it's out of Beta! :-)			"

								I requested refund right away.It's fun for the first little while, but it doesn't take long to figure out that this game lacks any real content.I decided to research this game (wiki) after playing for a while.Here's my conclusion.There's a lack of monster and level diversity, there isn't a huge variety of items, there's no way to sell items (not a huge issue, but still worth mentioning).The game engine was well made, the dungeons are somewhat fun to explore, but it's easy to see how this game would get repetitive fast. It's strikingly similar to Minecraft, yet different. While Minecraft focuses on exploration and diversity (biomes, items, creatures, etc.), the developers of this game only chose to focus on dungeon exploration with little creativity in respect to monsters, items, and biome.I understand content takes time to add, but this game is already in beta, lacks a solid update history, and most importantly - diversity in monster, characters, and items. Let's get real, this game has been out since 2013 and it is now 2016 - So where's the content?While this game may provide fun for a short while, I would stay away from this one until the developers can get their act together.Consumers work hard for their money and deserve a polished game - this one is just not there yet.

								Delver is a lovely light-weight adventure that's easy to get into and out of again.  You can enjoy the thrill of exploration and battle in short bursts without getting overly invested in a character or the world, which makes it great for random casual play.  The new graphics are fantastic and charming, suited perfectly to Delver's overall lighthearted approach.  Strongly recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								A window in to the old school ways of dungeon crawling and FPS gameplay that's just as approachable for new and old gamers alike! Back when games didn't bog you down with forced tutorial segements where the game treats you like you have the IQ of a bee against a window, games presented you the tools and the world and said ""you're on your own, good luck! You're gonna need it..."" Through careful traversal of the world and observation of your enemies and the effects of your gear you became your own tutor. your victories and your failures were down to your strats, observations and reactions. This is what made games like Doom, Half Life and other 90's titles such classics and Delver brings back that style of gaming with grace and it's such a joy to see this approach to gaming still existant and appealing in this era of the industry!Delver is a dungeon crawler, first person roguelike where permadeath results in the loss of your character upon death along with your items and level. That SOUNDS punishing but with out it, the appeal of this game is simply lost and it takes the experience of being in this amazing game to really appreciate that. You do however keep any gold you find which allows you purchase items you feel may help either balance the weaknesses in your gameplay style or further boost your strengths. The game is split in to dungeon levels which go:Dungeon 1Dungeon 2Caves 1Caves 2Sewers 1Sewers 2RuinsThe objective is to make your way in to the cursed ruins and obtain an orb to then double back and actually climb your way through those levels back to the surface, all while being pursued by the undead that roam the ruins looking for their orb!Enemy types, difficulties and tactics vary through each level, constantly keeping you on your toes to see whether or not the enemy is fast, slow, hits hard or poisons or maybe they use projectile attacks. Eventually you'll come to recognise things like audio cues of monsters, the sounds of traps being detonated or particle effect remains on the floor, giving you clues as to what's gone on in the area.The game's golden feature which makes this such an appealing experience is that everything is useful and thinking outside the box is critical to success. And the beauty of it is it's all down to you which makes the gameplay so rewarding with even the simplest of feats. for example. I noticed my run speed was still too slow for me to run over a trap and not get enough distance to get away from the blast radius it triggers but I remembered seeing enemies also trigger traps so I thought ""what about items?"" I took a broken wand with no charges left in it and threw it on the trap. Sure enough it detonated and I could move through it during the down time while the trap was resetting. Not only did that feel rewarding that my plan worked but I now knew that 'useless' items like empty wands still served a purpose, so I kept on to one or two as I explored. Another example was when I was using a bow. I noticed sometimes when I missed, the arrow would bounce off a wall and I could pick it back up. When I came across the mage skeletons who are very projectile heavy and can easily be a problem, I wondered if I could bounce my arrows off the wall around a corner to fight them whilst being safe from their projectiles. I aimed at an angle and fired, sure enough the mage caught the arrow in his eye socket and he popped! Another rewarding feeling and a little more understanding of the game's mechanics!Delver is a very small budget game and when you get the hang of it, it can easily be done in under an hour which results in the game resetting after a victory screen as if you died which is a shame because it feels like all the content can be experienced in a short manner of time and I want to spend so many hours in the world of Delver! The game is still early access as I write this so here's hoping the amazing guy behind this high potential title keeps dishing out further quality content!(P.S. The projectile particle effects remind me so much of Heretic's visuals and that's just another 1000 bonus points to this title :P)			"

Early Access Review
								I say it in the most manly way possible when I say this game is adorable.It will lure you in with its cute, nostaligic-yet-tasteful, sprite based enemies. It will drop plenty of sweet, varied loot for you, keeping you in the game and letting you become further and further immersed. And just when you say ""This game is fun,  but a bit easy"", it will brutally murder you and take all your stuff, leaving you only with coins and questions.Being entirely randomly generated, from the size of each floor to the quality of each weapon, there is exellent replay value.   Each floor has a mix of challenging enemies and total pushovers, keeping the experience fun throughout the playthrough as the difficulty slowly raises. That is, until a sudden surprise right near the end ;)For its price and file size, the game is a fantastic little timewaster that is very easy to pick up but very hard to put down. If you're concerned about the Early Access status, I bought this game when it first popped up on Steam and felt it was a complete experience then. And yet somehow every update seems to make it better and better. No regrets.			"

Early Access Review
								A very interesting blend of dungeon crawl and roguelike, this game has held my attention since I first purchased it.  It's a good addition to your library.  It's simple enough to start playing when you have limited time or attention, but robust enough that you don't feel like you're playing an indie throwaway.  Its randomized levels provide replay value and the ability to stockpile gold between runs allows for you to splurge on a run to give yourself a head start.  Also, the developer is very active.  It's obvious Delver is a labor of love.Some tips, for new players:1. Your HP refills when you level up, so stockpile your food in early levels.2. If you inventory is getting full, leave a treasure trove of food and wands at the ladder down to the next floor.3. Heavier armor slows you down, but not as much as you might think.4. When leveling, I prioritize Health > Attack > Speed.  I've never put points into the stats that buff wands or archery.5. Zombies and caterpillars (but not spiders, as of when I wrote this) will poison you with their attacks.			"

								I'm enjoying the game immensely.  It's quite simple to pick up and understand, you can play it for 5 minutes or 5 hours and it's always fun.  If you end up dying (which will likely happen a lot for the first few tries) you restart at the camp and go through a new dungeon with randomized equipment to start but gold carries over from each life.  There are 2 shop characters in the camp outside, 1 for general equipment (armor, weapons, potions, etc) and the other for scrolls that might come in handy.  Generally use the wands when you have them and you'll last longer.  Anything ranged works best.Overall I'd give the game 9/10.  I only drop it by 1 cause it's a little repetitive over time but still quite fun even with the simple graphics which I find perfect for the game and it's style of play.  It's also not a super expensive game and as of the time I played it I didn't notice any bugs through about 6 levels of the dungeon.  Everything seems to function like it's suppose to and makes it a wonderful game.			"

								Delver is an early access roguelike game that has been in early access for way too long. While the soundtrack and retro graphics are cozy, other things such as frustrating ranged combat and the overall lack of stability are not. The random crashes are especially bad and the sound will occasionally cut out for no reason. After crashing to desktop for the third time in an hour, and having to log off each time because the lingering process prevents re-launching the game, I decided to put this title down for good. There’s no reason a game that started development in 2013 should still have so many stability issues in 2017. Buy something else. "

								I'd say it's worth the 8 bucks for its replay value, however the content isn't something to get excited about. At the moment the game is very short, you may get a few good hours and it'll get boring after some time.If you don't like Early-Access then don't buy this game yet.To avoid getting burned out on the game, just take 15-30 minutes of gameplay and take a break. Why am I telling you this you ask? Well, I had the same problem with Minecraft while it was in beta, played it a ♥♥♥♥ton and as soon as it was out of beta I missed the old days and my enjoyment of Minecraft was ruined.Don't play this for long periods of time.

								So i felt this game needs a review because of how it good it is (in my opinion). I'll start off by saying that this is a game in which when you die you loose just about everything, i won't tell you what you keep because it defeats the purpose of playing it doesn't it. But this game combines a perfect sense of rogue-like/fps with modular enhancements on the website. The game although being in Early-Acess, which i can already hear the ugggh another one. Yes it is in early access but it being in early access means lots of updates and things to look forward to in the game to make you want to play it even more after each update.Pros- It combines rogue-like/rpg style game with a nice combat experience- Really simple and easy to pick up even just to play around 1 life- Animations are pretty decent for what it is- In my opinion its not to hard or too easy it hits that sweet spot that most games don't - Varying loot is always a thing i love to see and this game has it and like skyrim you want to pick up everything- Modular (-meaning skins, hopefully in the future other mods)- It has a random loadout everytime delving into the dungeon that keeps the game refreshing Things to Improve Upon- Just some mechanics nothing to important like the save game feature- I would like to see a bigger camp in the future maybe, just with a bit more options maybe a reward/trophy house of boss another idea - Steam achievements would be nice so I work towards or find something to it that adds a rewarding experienceCons- For an early access not sure it can be counted as a con but it falls short beatable in like 3 hours since i last played it :(- It's not really rewarding for the outside camp experience to meYes it's a good game but there arent many cons i found in my experience of playing it all the way through. I will always look forward to hack and slashing my way to the end again as the game updates. This will definately go on the list of games i follow to see what comes of it. its an easy 7.5/10 :3.

								I played this game for a solid three hours right after I got it and never once got bored. Sure, I almost rage quit a couple times, but that's just video games. I like that you dont customize your character because if you did you would be way more upset with dying (which you do QUITE A BIT). No two dungeons are the same, and you face new challenges and get new rewards with every delve into the myserious ruins. Some rooms are the same each play (just the rooms with transition ladders, however), yet the game never runs out of surprises or fun. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the dungeon crawler genre, pixelated graphics, or adventure games in general. P.S. : you can not jump in this game, space is just another attack key. I learned this the hard way, with the help of a gap, ledge, and pool of lava.			"

								PROS:-Dive-on-in style of play, start the game, jump in and try your luck!-Permadeath makes the game feel more enthralling until the inevitable loss of a character you like/got far with.-Lovely pixelated art style.-Britty guud atmosphere, and the level designs are varied, too!-Combat feels good, and kills gitcha PUMPED.-Exploration is satifying.-Loot is restricted to items you can use, no shop/merchant goo-goo-goo bull♥♥♥♥♥♥-Randomly generated dungeons keep each play session fresher than the average bear.CONS:-Pretty much abandoned, although the devs beg to differ on their twitter (but I'm not making a twitter to find out lol ♥♥♥♥ twitter).-Few bugs here and there, nothing really game-breaking that I've run into thus far.-Is still in beta stage after being released nearly three years ago for EA (Early Access) purchase.-Last update was September 21st, 2015. Quickly approaching the year mark since it was updated.All in all, I'll gladly change this review to a recommendation as soon as another update comes along/the devs show they care/it comes out as a full release. Really fun FPS roguelike, but unless you can comfortably toss $7.99 away on a game that may or may not be finished, I'd recommend waiting for a sale or it's full release.			"

								Pretty decent game. It still needs work and I honestly think you should hold out for a release because it's been four months since the last word on development and honestly this game is barely worth $8 in it's current state. It's a pretty engaging game if dungeon crawls are your thing. It's got all the stuff that makes a dungeon crawler wonderful. I enjoyed it a lot but I have a couple gripes:First, this game is like all the other roguelike-likes. It has randomly generated levels and some light RPG mechanics and that's it for likenesses. I would love to have a roguelike-like that doesn't distance itself so heavily from roguelike mechanics, but what can you do.Second, the difficulty spikes through the ceiling at the end. The game's really easy for something that bills itself as a roguelike game, up until the very end. It's really frustrating to work your way through the game for an hour or two only to hit an unbeatable ending that throws the cheapest difficulty it can at you: flooding the rooms with spawns of endgame enemies at a rate of ~1/sec(that's an honest estimation, not an exaggeration). I'm all for reasonable progression of difficulty, and this ain't it.Overall, I kinda-sorta recommend this game. It definitely needs work, but I think you'll find some enjoyment out of it in its current state. Whether that enjoyment is worth $8 is debatable. I would personally suggest you wait for more work to be done on it before buying.			"

Early Access Review
								Delver looked good. I heard a good review and it was on sale so I checked it out. I beat the game in 74 minutes. After learning some basic strategies, enemies became super predictable and completely unthreatening. At no point was there any fear or tension. I killed the boss without even realizing his significance. With no enemy scaling, leveling health and decking myself out in good armor made me essentially unkillable. Even barring that, the endgame whoopsie do of having to run back through the entire level refilled with monsters was a cakewalk. You could run circles around them and not get hit. On top of that, the twist ending bored me. There was no presentation to it, no aplomb, no reason to care about it. I have no reason to come back to this game. I have seemingly seen all there is to see in it. I enjoyed my time delving, but have been given no reason to ever come back to it. There is no point to this game being a roguelike, which was the entire reason I wanted to play it in the first place. Even if there is some second and third layer of fun I could come back to, it's not evident. Character progression is not saved. There is no reward for beating the game.I had fun. I was expecting so much more. The money per time enjoyed ratio is higher than a longer theatrical release. That's not what I've come to expect out of games.			"

								Imagine Minecraft. Now imagine if Notch had made good on his promises to make combat and dungeons, instead of pooing out some placeholders and leaving it to work on other projects. Now imagine someone took them out, and made them a shortish replayable randomized standalone game, that uses doom-style sprites instead of block models.That's Delver.			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of those games that don't look as fun as the playthroughs of it. I was in love with the graphics, but the charm soon wears off, within only three hours for me personally. Regaurdless, don't be completely deterred from this game by my review. You can still get some enjoyment out of it (though I would never recommend it at full price). Don't have high expectations though. After watching several playthroughs of the game and seen what I thought was a ton of fun, I was disappointed with the actual product.I've seen this being described as a ""a rougebased 3d RPG game with permadeath"" To put it more basic, it's a dungeon crawler at it's simplist. There's nothing complex about it. Explore the dungeon fighting enemies, leveling up, and picking up loot like weapons, food, potions, and armor. So anyone can jump into it right away. However it's not exactly easy either. In the beginning I struggled with not succumbing to foes as it's an art to get close enough to hit an enemy with your beginning weapon (a very short dagger) without getting attacked yourself every time. You have to be at just the right distance to hit them without getting hit back, and since you only start with a mere 8 HP, it can be tough for new players, but it's just something to get used to. The goal of the game is to descend down 7 floors, defeat a boss, collect an orb from him, and to work your way back up the 7 floors to leave without dying. Some people have said the game is very easy, and that they were able to beat it in a mere hour or less. I've had a hard time with it, and I'll explain why. It's typical logic that you need to be a high level the farther you advance. Althoguh other players may disagree about this with me, I've found that I've needed to grind, or else I'm just not leveled up enough the deeper into the dungeon I get. The big problem with this is that it's almost impossible to grind in Delver. After you clear the floor the first time, enemies will continue to spawn a little (for a short time), but they'll spawn less and less until they stop all together. When I backtrack, I only run into a few to zero enemies, which means I have to go back and forth on a floor over and over again to try to level up. It's a very slow process. I also have to cover the two glitches I noticed. The first thing I noticed was how very laggy such a graphically simple game was, and then I noticed more specifically, it was lagging in time with the music. I had to turn the music off because it really slowed down the game. Maybe it's just my laptop and won't happen to all computers, but I figured I would give the heads up to people. The sound effects worked just fine however, and I want to mention the nice touch it added to the gameplay. The enemies would say phrases like ""I heard something"" and ""What was that?"" that would make you aware of their presence. Now you could still be spooked by an enemy, because some enemies wouldn't make much noise, but it did cut back on the startling surprise. The second glitch only happens in the caves, which are the 3rd and 4th levels in the game. The cave walls are very uneven and blocky, over all very odd looking. It's not easily clear where you can fit through and where you can't. Quite a few times, I got a little too close to just the side of the wall when I was walking, and I immediately got stuck. I refused to start over, and so I would spend 10-15 minutes trying to get myself free. For anyone else who experiances this, first take off your helmet, and then repeatedly use a weapon (I found the dagger most helpful) to hit either above or below you while holding in the key to go backwards. It's very tedious and annoying, and there are no changes to show your progress, but all at once you'll be free. The very last time however, I got stuck for good and tried for probably a half hour to get out to no avail. There's nothing more frusterating then losing precious progress. There are three other minor things worth mentioning. You collect gold, but you can't buy anything during that playthrough. Instead, the gold carries over when you die, and you can buy items the next round, before you enter the dungeon again. The way you leveled up bugged me. There are six different attributes, but when you level up, only three available ones show up, randomized each time. If you want to upgrade a certain skill, it often isn't there to choose. There are also different kinds of pressure plates in the game. Some hurt you, but one kind is a teleportation pad that will teleport you to a random place in the level. In all my time of playing, I have not once come across a single teleporter. I wondered if they had removed it in an update, but there are places in the level that you can not physically reach yourself.You'll see in other reviews that this game doesn't have a lot of replayability. I didn't believe this at first, but it rings true. You'd think a game with randomly generated dungeons would have endless fun, but it actually gets old fast. I can't put my finger on as to why, but it does. Perhaps it's *too* simple, and needs something more to spice it up. It's still in it's beta state (at the time of writing this review) so I won't knock it off yet. It still has time to grow and evolve. I personally did not enjoy it a lot, but I feel like other players will get more, longer lasting fun out of it than I did because I'm very picky about dungeon crawlers. They are definately not my favorite genre, so that may have contributed to why I didn't enjoy this game more. For the record, this game isn't horrible or even bad. I just thought it was okay, and that's the only reason I'm not recommending it, but that's just my own opinion. It is surely possible to enjoy this game, so give it a try if you've had your eye on it. Useful guides:

Early Access Review
								English version (Wersja polska poniżej)This charming little piece of dungeon crawling may have nothing truely unique to offer, but besides that, it's simple,solid and stylish. And it provides that eerie feeling I remember from exploring the caves in the Minecraft.  The combat is simple, yet engaging. There is a variety of melee,  ranged and magical weapons available and balancing quick, strong and ranged attacks is the key to survival. The graphics of this game are really appealing. While pixelated, they perfectly fit together to create a consistent ""minecrawl"" experience. Special mention goes to the utterly hilarious, 80-90s anime styled facial expressions the human enemies make when hit. Music is also likable and moody. What I didn’t really enjoy is the character leveling system.  While it is traditionally experience based, on every level the player is given 3 choices on what to upgrade. The problem is that there are more than three stats and thus sometimes there is no option to improve the desired characteristic and the  progress gets a bit random. Furthermore, there is no description regarding what a particular stat does. While most of them are self-explanatory,  a seasoned RPG gamer in me desires at least a basic defining of the difference between the Speed and Agility. Not much of a problem though – characters don’t usually live long enough to regret.  On the other hand, the game goes to the great lengths to make itself as user-friendly as the dungeon crawler can be. Traps are always clearly visible, and one cannot die of hunger, food restores the hit points instead.The greatest problem with this game, at least for me, is the fact that it gets boring after a few runs. Nonetheless, it is perfect for the short evening sessions. Furthermore, when I decide to play a rogue it means something, since I’m usually too tired of starting over again and again in the real life to follow the same pattern in games. Still, Delver seems to be the right choice to spend a few nights with sword in your main and a glass of whisky in off hand. Yeah, I too used to play an ambidextrous character in the good, old DnD days. Wersja polska Delver jest uroczym, małym dungeon crawlerem. Nie wprowadza do gatunku nic nowego, ale za to jest prosty, solidny i stylowy. I powoduje to samo osobliwe uczucie co długi spacer po jaskiniach w Minecrafcie.System walki jest prosty, ale wciągający. Gra daje do użytku spory wybór broni białej, dystansowej oraz zaklęć i znalezienie między nimi balansu jest kluczem do przetrwania. Grafika, mimo pikseli na pół ekranu, robi świetne wrażenie. Kolory są jaskrawe i dobrane tak, że idealnie pasują do tego „minecrawla”. Gra dostaje ode mnie dodatkowe punkty za miny które robią niektórzy przeciwnicy kiedy oberwą – przypominające anime z lat 80-90, potrafią naprawdę rozbawić.  Muzyka też od razu wpada w ucho i świetnie buduje nastrój. Gra podpada za to sysyemem levelowania postaci. Tradycyjnie, opiera się on na expach zdobywanych na wrogu, a przy każdym levelu dostajemy do wyboru 3 staty które możemy „podbić”. Problem polega na tym że cech opisujących postać jest więcej, więc czasem nie dostajemy opcji ulepszenie tego co akurat by się przydało i sprawia że rozwój postaci przebiega nieco losowo. Dodatkowo, cechy nie są w żaden sposób opisane. Niby nie problem domyślić się od czego jest atak a od czego wytrzymałość, ale zatwardziały RPGowiec we mnie domaga się jednak wytłumaczenia różnicy między szybkością a zręcznością. Inna sprawa że nie jest to jakiś straszny problem – bohater i tak na ogół nie żyje na tyle długo żeby żałować dokonanych wyborów. Z drugiej strony Delver stara się jak może, by być przyjaznym graczowi. Pułapki zawsze są widoczne z daleka, a jedzenie odnawia HPki – nie można tu umrzeć z głodu.   Największy problem, przynajmniej dla mnie, to fakt że gra nudzi się dość szybko. Na krótkie sesje jest jednak idealna.  Co więcej, jeżeli polecam jakiegoś rogulca, musi coś w tym być, na ogół brakuje mi cierpliwości by zaczynać grę od początku po tym jak zginę. Podsumowując: Delver nadaje się idealnie do spędzenia kilku nocy z mieczem w jednej, a szklaneczką whisky w drugiej ręce. A co? Też grałem „oburęcznymi” postaciami w starych, dobrych, DnDkowych czasach.			"

								This is a very promising game judging on what I've just played. I started playing two hours ago and I haven't stopped. I even got my sister to play it. I appreciate the graphics as it's become its own style.  The music is fitting and very importantly not annoying since I will be hearing the same tunes for a while. The combat is satisfying since enemies literally just obliterate when dying (and not to mention how bad I feel for the bats when they squeak). Some of the weapons and skills could use a description and perhaps there can be more interaction with the environment such as breakable boxes rather than unbreakable ones. A lot of this is just fine tuning and my opinion, though.There isn't much to spoil in this game as all of it will unravel as you start playing. It was worth my 8 dollars for sure.			"

								A very neat little game, and a very great roguelike for people who like those. Its combat and item systems are pretty well made and the difficulty progresses fairly as you progress. Since this game is in early access, there are obviously going to be new things added soon most likely, and the game is made in a way where it is very open to new things, which is what I really enjoy about it. Even though death means you start all over, you don't have to always start completely from scratch, as you keep your collected gold and can buy powerful items from the start if you wish to do so, which is another thing real enjoyable about this game. Overall, my early access rating would have to be 9/10. If you really enjoy roguelike games, this game is an amazing approach to it, and any fans of the genre would definitly enjoy this game.			"

								I beat this game on my very first try in under two hours, and I've just realized that that means I can get a refund for it, which I'm now sure to do. For what this game is, it looks and feels very, very nice. The pixel art, engine, and polish on this game are all very well done, and the beginning of the game left a pretty good taste in my mouth (which may be more than some people say for my game, Barony). However, this game simply has no depth to it. The music is very limited and loops constantly, so even though it sounds nice at first it gets tiring quickly. There are no skill trees, there is no diversity in each playthrough, and the mechanical variety of the game is just so low -- it's hard to describe, but gameplay-wise, there's no MEAT to this game.I was not aware that this game even existed when I made my own first-person ""roguelike"", and I've only just now played it, so I fully admit I may be biased -- but after having beaten this game, as well as coming away from it from an initially positive impression, I have to say I am not too impressed with this game now. The developers are very smart and talented, but I just don't think they put in enough effort with this game. This is probably what I'd call a wasted opportunity for some really nice first-person RPG goodness.			"

								Delver is an addicting, first-person, dungeon crawler with procedurally generated dungeons. It is still of course unfinished, so there are bugs to fixed and new things to be added, but it is still very satisfying. However, it doesn't really bring much new to the table. It's still a beautiful game in both sound, graphics, and gameplay, but it's not quite a masterpiece. It's like one of Picasso's early paintings. It's still great, but not like his later paintings which truly defined him. Nonetheless, it is still tons of fun to play, and keeps on bringing you back again and again, even after you've beaten the game. Despite not being completely inventive, it still is a lovely game, and even for $7.99, considering that it is still is in early access, i highly reccomend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, so let me be perfectly blunt here. I have played little more than an hour of this game so far, but I can already sum up everything I have to say about Delver in one word: Potential.Delver is a fresh, unique take on the rogue-like games that have been pouring in recently from many indie developers from all over the world. It takes on many thematic rogue-like elements: It's challenging, randomly generated, and as fun as a bag full of rabid chipmunks dumped into an elementary school.I'm not saying this game is without its issues, but it's still in its early access phase, and must be taken with a grain of salt. Considering this fact, Delver is chocked full of endless potential. Its first-person perspective and highly pixelated environment and graphics allow this game far more room to breathe then one would expect at first glance. Even in its early phases, the amount of different consumable items and pieces of unique equipment are quite impressive, and the level-up system that resets after every miserable failure allows a very immersive RPG-like quality to the game. You're able to play differently every single run. Want to focus on high armor and melee combat? Go right ahead! Feel like going for a more mobile, long-range bow combatant? Be my guest! Or maybe you just want to pump all of your points into magic and blow the CRAP out of every enemy in sight with one of the many different elemental weapons in the game. Why wouldn't you?!It is this amount of flexibility within a game that is comprised of so little options as of right now that makes me positive that there's no where to go but up from here for Delver. So many environments yet to be created; so many monsters yet rendered in that simplistic-yet-beautiful art style; many more items, potions, and pieces of armor yet to be looted off of bandit corpses or found in the dank corner of a cave! Heck, there is even a large part of the Delver community that claims this game has everything it needs to move on to an online co-op mode! Who knows?All I can say is, that even after only an hour of gameplay, I can already close my eyes and imagine what can be done with a game this inventive, this creative, this simple, and this ambitious! If you haven't taken a peek at Delver yet, I suggest very highly, for the love of yourself AND your rabies-free elementary schoolers that you do. This game is nothing but raw potential and ingenuity, and I KNOW you don't want to miss out on it! That being said:This is the Captain, Signing Out.			"

Although there are a couple of features which do need improving in future releases such as: - quests - bosses - town portals to buy and sell items. (There is an npc on level 3 or 4 but it would be good to revisit the town again :-) ) - Jumping, although not required for the current auto-generated map design, I think it would improve the maps a little, enabling you to jump over traps.

								Game has some serious balance issues. Enemies that jump at you can jump and hit you well before they're in your weapon range. Sometimes they land on top of you where you can't hit them but they can hit you. I've seen bats fly up through the ceiling where you can't hit them, only to fly down out of the ceiling to hit you. Despite the fact that the game isn't too difficult it just feels like it can have many cheap hit moments. I'd rather have a hard game that felt fair. Arrows are messed up. If you shoot an arrow then pick it up again it no longer stacks in the same stack. Arrows bought in the store don't stack in the same stack. It's like what the heck were they thinking?No I have not put a whole lot of time into this game. That's because there's not much to the game right now. It has around 10 levels to explore.			"

								At first I found the game a bit simple. I'm a pretty big NetHack and Speelunky fan and thought it was a bit too rough around the edges. After about 3 hours and a few levels down everything clicked. The item management and simple level up system really do have a sense of drama that feels more ""roguelike"" than I was expecting. I'm four hours into the game now and pretty pleased with it. The game could use more items and item interaction, but in the state its in I can recommend it.			"

								Picked up Delver during the Steam Sale. Definitely worth the $3 it cost.I wouldn't call it '3d' in more than a limited sense, it feels a lot more like Doom's 2.5d- 3d environments, sprite monsters, etc. Still, it's one save file you can't back up and one life in a randomly generated roguelike. It actually makes for a pretty cool story:I started off in a little camp with a couple of shopkeepers and the obligatory guest appearance of Old Man Exposition, who explained that there was a MacGuffin at the bottom of yonder dungeon. He also seemed troubled that people kept going in but never coming out. More on that later.So I notice I have no gold, yet everything the shopkeepers sell costs gold. Okay, fine, we'll come sell some crap later. I head down the ramp, at which point the music changes to a far darker and more foreboding track. It was more apt than I realized, but I ignored it as I clicked on the door.Ten minutes later and I'm about halfway through the first floor of the dungeon, packing my inventory with goodies to sell. You get a pretty generous inventory, and I was crammed to the gills with extra armor and weapons to unload. A quick glance at my map and I headed for the exit. Reached the door... and it's locked. The key is the MacGuffin. ♥♥♥♥.I do a quick Google search and lo and behold, there is no selling of items to shops- any gear other than the best stuff you've got is essentially dead weight. I tossed half my inventory on the spot and continued downwards, making it three levels before getting vaporized in a headlong hasted charge on a Beholder. Thus ended Game One.A couple presses of the Return key later and I find myself back in the camp. My inventory looks a little different- a different starting wand, a gold potion instead of a red one (the potions randomize their effects every game and you have to find out which is which by drinking them- and one just happens to be poison; the game really does hate you). And now I find out why there's shopkeepers: My gold carries over between runs, so previous me can give current me a head start with some gear and a stat point or two. As I got ready and drank my starter potion to find out what it was (arcane shield this time), I remembered the old man's words:""There's a lot of people going in, but nobody ever comes out.""Over the next two hours I went in several times, and never came back out. Death happens a lot in this game- and usually right when you start to get cocky. I began learning to glance at my health bar every few seconds, more if I was in combat. Keeping myself in top shape was a priority- every level had its own special combination of ranged and melee mobs, and more often than not you'd find yourself beset by something with a sword that you'd have to kill while dodging fire from other things trying to vaporize you. Corners became my best friend- either because I'd lead the melee mob around them and out of the ranged mob's line of fire, or just as a place to sit down and cry now and then.Since it actually has a win condition, I can say I felt my pulse quicken and nerves get twitchier as I got towards the end. I'll try not to spoil much, but the game doesn't really get hard until AFTER you get the MacGuffin: now you have to get out. Oh, and did I mention that picking up the MacGuffin awakens the undead horde that's apparently buried under every square foot of this dungeon?For the last fifteen minutes I was continually mumbling ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; under my breath as I dodged through the dungeon towards the exit with the MacGuffin, hoping I'd invested enough speed while leveling up to outpace the horde of undead nipping at my heels (I hadn't, one type of undead in particular is fast, flies, and will bite your face off if ignored). Having to turn to kill the speedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I almost instantly found myself swallowed by the undead wave advancing behind me, forcing me to burn my two most powerful wands to blow a hole in their ranks and escape. It's at this step that preparation becomes critical: I'd carefully and methodically laid a cache of gear for myself at the lower entrance to every floor; a wand, a health item, and some protective potions awaited me in the short breath I had while the skeletons closed in from the darker parts of the level. Dumped the empty wands, got some regeneration going, and off it was again to try and make it through Skeletor's Funhouse without joining the ranks of my would-be murderers.By the time I got up the first floor again I was feeling good- I had a feeling that I'd be pretty worn down by this point, so I'd left an exceptionally generous cache on this floor. With no reason to hold back, I lined up every wand I had left and burned a path to the exit. Even then, so many mobs were in my way that I used up every wand and was still just outside the final room leading to the exit. The only mob in the way is one of the first-floor goons that happened to spawn, but my arrows were used up on the way down and my wands on the way up, leaving me with my trusty but oh-so-weak shortsword. I'd decided that I'd finesse my melee combat this playthrough, and as such had put all of my stat points into speed, magic, and health- I relied on careful maneuvering to win melee, a tactic you can afford on the way down.This was not the way down. This was the way up, and I had enough undead closing in on me to make Left 4 Dead blush. I have 60+ hp and am regenerating, but while I brutally stab the mob in front of me to death my health bar is getting gnawed to nothing. I was in the single digits when my victim finally keeled over and died, leaving me to burst unopposed through the chokepoint, leave my undead pursuers behind, and have the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic door-opening ever as I got to the exit, barely alive but victorious.So yeah, it's a fun game. Give it a whirl.			"

								For as much flak as this game get's it is quite fun, although the dev's have basically abandoned this game there's still enough to it that will hold your attention.I won't bore you with details, other than be a man and go attack and speed only.However I will say that the magic and potion system are very annoying, a mana bar would suffice.And it's kinda hard to tell what your skill points do for you.

								As much as I wanted to like it, there is a severe lack in content in Delver. The game can be somewhat fun, but once you realize that you've seen about everything in the first hour or two, it loses its appeal. And unlike other dungeon crawlers, there is practically no replay value due to a lack of variety. Also, as often mentioned by others, with a slow pace in updates, it doesn't seem that this game will reach a state that reverses this opinion for me any time soon or possibly ever. For $8, it isn't awful, and there are glimmers of a good game underneath. But the game itself is too barebones; you may as well throw in a few more dollars and find a better rogue lite for your money's worth.			"

								Honestly Kinda enjoyed this game for the first hour... then things went downhill. Even with the updates i can't bring myself to play this game for more than 5-10 minutes at a time.It's not a bad game and at least they are trying but if it was more like the OLD school turn based dungeon crawlers would have a much better playrate for myself. I miss the days when you could find the upgrades and even half-way craft your own items then go back to a central location and rest and heal up... more options to the story would be a great thing i would love to see an updated version of the old old 8 bit dungeon crawlers this... is not one of those. I'm not giving it a bad review just because i don't prefer the style it's in but I would not recomend it for those looking for old school experience.			"

								In response to the recent crap about this game being abandoned:Now I have been hearing a lot of crap about how this game has been abandoned and how you “Should not buy it until its finished.” Screw those guys. They have NOT played it enough. I mean the guys have not even played 5 hours. So yes this game has not been updated since 9/20/2015, but if you take a honest look at what they have here its a near complete game. The only update it may need are a couple of bug fixes to things not even game breaking. I mean its not like cube world where there is nothing and might be abandoned. Cube world is boring and abandoned. This game is fun and might be abandoned. This game still has new things to throw at me and I have played 42 hours so far and thinking I've seen everything but then I made a new play through and boom I've seen a dungeon layout that I've never seen before. I even saw some treasure rooms and I'm like “Since when did delver have treasure rooms?” Put this game on your wish list and buy it when its on sale. This game is worth it.Now time to my actual reviewThis game is a throwback to how games used to be. Before story was added. Before you needed to know enough statistics you might as well get a fricken degree in the stuff. I thinking of YOU pokemon, I love you but my gosh your competitive play is just full of maths. Literally you wake up at a camp and need talk to some guys and walk into a door and boom your in the game. Your goal? Get to the end of the dungeon, grab the orb and get back to the start. Sounds easy right? Hah! Nope! As soon as you grab the orb, the quiet peacefull dungeon run you had on the way down, which I must say isn't very hard but just engaging enough to keep playing but at the same time punishes your mistakes, is now a absolute hell hole where you just want to survive the trek up. I make sounds of terror that I have never made before on my way up. If your an angry person, this game may not be for you just for this part. My gosh I love it. As soon as you grab the orb you see why this game is called rouge like.I rate this game 10/10 yes I really do, I don't care if its abandoned or not this is a good game.If you don't want to buy it now put it on your wish list and remember it exists because you have no excuse to not buy this game when its on sale. This is one of the best Indie games I've played and deserves more credit.			"

 A Recipe for Nostaglic and Indie Goodness Mix ""The Legend of Zelda"" with ""Shadowgate"" together and sift ""Dragon Warrior"" through the top and fold it over in a large mixing bowl of condensed ""Doom"". Put the contents in a pan buttered with ""Dungeons of Dagorath"" and into the oven pre-heated at 16-bit graphics and what do you know? You get THIS delicous nostalgic and exciting gem called ""Delver"".I just LOVE retro games, even though I didn't exist in the 80's or even the 90's. And you don't see tweens who would rather play Centipede than Call of Duty enough these days. (Maybe only where I live.) Anyways, the simplistic fun of those games just tugs at my heartstring. Everything from Coleco-vision to the Nintendo 64 I love. (And I don't think E.T. for the Atari 2600 is that bad either.) Well, I shouldn't say EVERY GAME or EVERY SYSTEM. (shudders at the thought of the Philips CD-i) But, I bet you get the picture. I was looking in the Google Play store on my tablet, searching ""What other users installed"" for Minecraft Pocket Edition. I scrolled WAY down until my eyes caught the glimpse of a simple 8-bit figure wearing a green shirt and holding a stick. I decided to check it out. Now what I DON'T like is a classic game ripoff. But I can't find a game in the back of my head that is almost exactly the same as the game Delver. So, I decided to buy it, hoping my money didn't go to waste. The description of the game is definatly true to its word, and I enjoyed it. Sure, there were a couple bugs in the game, and the controls were kind of awkward, I really love the graphics, the concept and, overall, the entire game. A while after that, I got Steam. When I discovered Delver was also on Steam, I couldn't be more excited. The controls were MUCH better than the version I had on my tablet. I just couldn't wait for the next updates. Well, that's my story how I found Delver, but then, there are also reasons I LOVE to play Delver.I've read some of the negative reviews on Steam, some of them complain that there is little story to this game. I could care less about a story than those guys. I would rather just play the game and explore a dangerous dungeon in which I would probably die a horrible death in order to get a useless item because ""what the heck,"" than sit through endless cutscenes or do a lot of reading. The leveling up system is both very simplistic, but very effective and game-changing at the same time. The music is AWESOME! I could listen to the game's tracks all day. Getting to the Orb, the music is somewhat calm but suspensful and adventurous at the same time. When you go back to the surface, though, the music immediatly switches to all out frightening and suspensful, raising your stress meter. The abundant variety of weapons, armor, wands and the ability to hold something on your left hand is remarkable and you can't help but to be very stingy about the items you have in your inventory. You never know what the potions would do in each game, and which ones to drink or not. But as long as you know which potion is which in the earliest floors, The relevently small inventory space show that there is not a lot to spare and you need to be very conservative, in which I like. The easier reach to the Orb will make you feel that this game is to easy and you become cocky. But once you get the Orb, you realize that Delver's adventure is not yet over. You still need to escape to the surface. That's when all heck breaks lose. Enemies start to respawn, not to metion those annoying skeleton mages whose magic cooldown seems like a half a second. The difficulty gets much harder than ever before, and you have a very long way to go before you get to the top. The entire thrill and the adventure of the game captures my heart.There are not many things for me to wish anymore about this game. Although, a few things doesn't mean anything at all, despite how amazing I believe this game is. Every once in a blue moon, the rest of the dungeon becomes impossible to progress and continue, which is very dissapointing the moment you discover it. On your journey to the Yithidian Orb, I noticed that enemies don't respawn. I would like the developers to add respawning to the first half of the game to make it a little harder, but not too hard though. When you get to the boss, I would like the boss fight to be nessecary to get the Orb. Plus, the boss fight is insignificant and easy. All you need wolf down an arcane and iron skin potion and you practically won the fight. I've also noticed a pattern that some of the rooms are exactly the same in other runs, and that more variety of rooms and maps should be added. Bigger and more floors would be nice, too. Other than that, I have no other complaints.I can't wait when Delver is going to be off Beta stage. I hope more people will come and play this wonderful game. Delver team, don't stop on improving the game. Please know that this game has HUGE potential and that there are fans, eager to play the game.Well, that's all I have to say. Aldisimoo, OUT!			"

								Very impressive roguelike game that takes on a new perspective rather than the usual sidescroller or topdown view however you call that. The game looks very finished for being in early access... only thing its missing is more content which is good to see in game. So many game developers want to make every little detail in their head happen in their game that they spread themselves too thin making their game look overall unfinished if that makes any sense. I like the physics of the game, how arrows can actually bounce off of walls and hit you, though it can get kind of annoying when you're trying to peek your head out around a corner and shoot something... then learn that you wernt far enough around the corner. The developer of this game could very well call this a full game and never work on it again, but he has the respect to tell people that he isn't finished with this game and that there will be more to come. Seriously there are ""fully released"" games on steam that are terrible and are only worth the 99 cents as a joke to a friend, I like the fact that this game could pass off as a full game and chooses not to.Finally I'm looking forward to updates and the full release of this game. Like others have said if you want to wait until its finished thats on you.			"

 Early Access Review I'll start off by saying that this game has a lot of replay value, however it's a little on the short side and finishing the game isn't all that hard. One thing that I need to point out is just how beautiful this game is. The shape of the land isn't made of cubes like what you'll find in Minecraft, but it's all shaped to really make a dungeon, cave, or sewer scene come to life. The only thing that is cubey are the textures on the landscape.The combat is simple but it isn't boring. You can choose to use a dagger, sword, longsword, club, bow, or one of the many magic wands that do different things. Like a true RPG, as you play you'll level up, you can power up stats (health, speed, etc..), and you will also find higher level armor, weapons, and enemies.This is the perfect game for anyone looking for a rogue-like RPG dungeon crawler.Delver is worth the CDN$8.79 price. It has earned all of it's positive reviews.			"

Early Access Review
								Besides the typical trends of -INDIE- -ROGUELIKE- -PIXEL GRAPHICS- that games these days try and cash in on, this game is actually pretty fun. It felt reminiscent of Daggerfall's dungeons or early dungeon crawling games of the 90s except with modern controls and pacing. This isn't a turn based roguelike, which is hilarious refreshing in what is one of my favourite genres now bloated with similar games trying to cater to people who only care about what I said above  (memes indie 16-bit roguelikevmetrovai- blah blah blah etc etc).The aesthetics are crisp and colorful and some weapons feel weighty and it's very satisfying knocking out monsters or pesky mages into blood pudding. Also traps in the dungeons effect the bad dudes and I spent more than I'd like to admit trailing bandits into a spike pit. When you slap people's nuts a little too hard but not enough to put them down, they'll run off and try and flank/sneak up on you, which is cool.I put all my stats into defence and attack and wore big platemail armor. This worked pretty well until a bunch of spooky liches tore me a new one with magic while I was huffed and puffed trying to get away. Only downer is it's an early access game and could use some content or fleshing out. I made it down 7th or so floor before being lich target practice (apparently this is the last floor?). This game is under 10$ CDN, how can you say NO to this.I also smashed a bandit with a sword in the face with a hammer and it made a sound like he pooped himself while he flew off a cliff into lava from the blow.I give it 6 green potions out of cheese piece. YUM.			"

								Puzzled how this game is still Early Access.Delver is pretty decent. I'm not floored by much of anything but it's managed to keep my attention for more than 10 minutes, and with all the un-played games in my library that's a compliment. Visually it's fine to look at, the art style is a mix of 3D environments that have a definite Minecraft vibe, whereas enemies and items are 2D sprites - although the animation on them is well done and actually useful in predicting attacks to get timing down. The soundtrack is great although turning off the music can be useful as almost every enemy gives away it's position with some basic sounds. Combat is alright, although it feels a little sluggish - even when you're wielding something light and quick like a dagger. Magic is much more satisfying and useful, but there's not a lot of it. The same can be said of bows and arrows. I think the game would be a lot more enjoyable and replayable if both magic and archery were viable ""builds"" on their own and not just supplements to melee.Nothing too fancy here, I would recommend this only if you were really looking for something in this style of game.

								An interesting and somewhat fascinating first person dungeon crawler marred by boring and repetitive dungeons and a simplicity that, while it makes the game easier to get into and lowers the price of admission, ultimately makes the replayability of the game low. The drop system needs reworking, as well. I've had games where I've gotten all kinds of spectacular gear drops throughout my run, and others where I was struggling to get fully equipped by the third floor.If you can get it cheaper than the asking price - say, about around $2.99 or so - then it's totally worth it. Otherwise, you're not missing much here.			"

								Granted I'm not old enough for this game to be as nostalgic to me as it would be for someone in their late 20's to early 30's (i'm 16) this game is a nostalgic masterpiece. Its 16-bit graphics is the bulk of its charm. But thats not all thats great about it. This game has the potential to be one of the greates rogue-likes on the market. At the moment it lacks any replay value. Once you beat it once, you lack the motivation to play through it a second time. But the game is still in development and looks very promising, If the devs were to add more randomization or and endless game mode, I would play this game for days at a time.			"

								What a pleasant surprise this game was. First of all I love the art direction and music (especially near the end!)Work keeps me busy and I don't have as much time to invest into other games. This game is PERFECT for those who want a casual (yet also challenging!) RPG/Rogue-like/Dungeon crawling experience neatly wrapped up into the charming game that is Delver.  Overall it took me a couple hours to complete but with the perma-death system and randomly distributed dungeon layout and loot, it certainly has hours of replayability. If you're on the fence about buying Delver just jump in. You won't be disappointed.			"

								It's a dungeon crawler with a great art style and creative enemies. It's a game to play for good fun, and it's really enjoyable. It's worth the 8 dollars, but if that's to much for you, make this one of the first games you'll buy when it goes on sale. I'd rate it an honest 8.5/10, but I'd rather play death road to canada or enter the gungeon.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very entertaining, even though it is in early access. Yes, it has been in early access since 2013, but it is still very much playable. Over the past year and a half I have played this game on and off, and never had any trouble with it. It runs smoothly, it's challenging at times, and you could play it for hours. I do fault it for having very rare updates, which handicaps the game getting out of early access, but that is more the dev's fault than the game's. But, the devs seem to have great ambitions for this game, so we can only hope. But, it still being in early access, there are some problems. The ranged combat system sometimes can't decide what it wants, but other than that, there really aren't any bugs I've seen. This is a good choice if you like a fast action dungeon crawler, and if you're patient for updates.			"

Early Access Review
								7/10A quite fun roguelike dungeon crawler, even though it has a very high frustration level involved.The premise is simple: you start a game, go in the dungeon, fight monsters, avoid traps, level up, find items and gear, then use what you have to get to the end of the dungeon, grab the orb and come back. Dungeons are randomly generated each time you go into a new level and even the potion effects are random each time you start a new game. It's simple enough, but not as easy to actually beat - could be perhaps described as ""easy to play, hard to master"", as you have to learn what stats work better for your play style, learn more about enemy behavior, wands and plan ahead to beat the game.As fun as the game is, there is a huge frustration level involved, not just because it's a roguelike game but also because of how the game works. The first reason is that the only thing carried over when you die is your money, which you can use to buy some starting gear, though that doesn't help much since gear will degrade with usage (specially weapons). The best thing you can buy is a potion that gives you an instant stat point to spend, but obviously it only lasts for one playthrough. The second reason is that sometimes the game can overwhelm you all of a sudden - maybe you're having a perfect playthrough, finding lots of good items and dealing with enemies one by one, then all of a sudden you find yourself in a situation where your health bar drops so quickly, you don't even notice it until you're dead. These sudden difficulty spikes make the game extremely frustrating at times.The game is currently on early access, so perhaps this issue will be addressed in the future, which might make the game a lot better than it currently is. Nonetheless, it's a fun and well made roguelike game.			"

								It looked great when I saw it on sale, so I picked Delver up. There are definitely a lot of good things going on with this game, and it has the potential to scale into something truly massive and amazing over time. I haven't tried the custom mod tools yet, though I'm hoping they provide options to greatly increase the depth of content available.After finally playing through it in its current state, I feel like I missed something - or the game is missing something - because it took me all of 1.6 hours to learn the game and complete it (even the run back) and the lack of a meaningful ending left it feeling like a hollow victory. I'd really love to talk with the developer and community together sometime to explore the current state of the game, and determine ways in which Delver could be made more amazing and worthwhile for everyone to buy and play. I was hoping for something that scales more like Diablo, 20+ floors and constantly rotating out gear for better stuff throughout the game, multiple classes with variations, well-defined boss enemies, or just to have truly everything randomized and have every experience be a new adventure. Right now the potions and dungeon layout are the only things which change, the variety of loot is rather static, and I come in exactly the same every time.  "

								I figured I'd say my piece.I love this game, I haven't played that long, but whenever I can't think of absolutely anything to do I always somehow end up playing this game. It has plenty of good points, and some not so great ones.The movement and combat is really satisfying, and brings me back to my childhod, when I'd play Doom with my dad. It's nice to see a Rogue Like that has a little bit of skill to it as well as the random aspect, although RNG can still sometimes kill you.I've never made it past the area after the sewers, crypt maybe? I can't remember what it's called. So I don't know how much end game content there is to this game. As it stands right now, it feels a little short, and a little shallow, but also not bad or unsatisfying. If this looks like a game that would appeal to you, it probably will.I give it a solid 7.5 out of 10. "

								Somewhat First Impressions:Been following since early alpha.Great little game with a lot of promise. And I'm hoping it lives up to it. Simple but fun first person roguelike with a distinct Ultima Underworld feel.Comes with an easy to use map editor and the ability to mod in community-made maps. This will hopefully increase the longevity of the game.As of this writing there hasn't been an update in a few months. But prior to that, the updates were great and always adding in new features. The switch to a proper artist was probably the best decision the developer made. I hope to see the game expand with more features and gameplay options in the future.Verdict: Looks promising but maybe wait to see how it turns out. As of right now it is only good for a few hours of entertainment, after which you'll get bored.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: I decided to come back to this to see what changes have been made, and guess what? Despite some changes that were for the better, the game still hasn't managed to get better in terms of gameplay. The game still feels like a bare bones action dungeon crawler RPG with rogue-like elements thrown in. Though it is very nice that you now have more use for your weapons than just killing enemies (for example, breaking down a door with your mace or breaking a crate in order to search for loot), that skill jars now cost more and that there is more variation with the music, the game still has not advanced enough for me to say that the game is going somewhere. In fact, I think the game actually took some steps back, especially with its new leveling system. The new leveling system works like this: each time you level up, you are allowed to put one point into one of three randomly chosen stats. This is a problem because it doesn't give the player a choice on what kind of build they actually want to have, which defeats the purpose of being able to put stat points into whichever stats you want in the first place. Now, once again, one might bring up the skill jars, but I should not have to grind money, die a couple of times, and then buy all these jars just to get the build I want to have, especially in a dull game like this. Speaking of dull, the game is still a dull hack and slasher RPG with enemies who are not very competent at catching up with you. Combat is still virtually the same, scroll wheels are still not an option, the game still lacks custimization features, etc. All in all, the game may have added some neat things, but it isn't enough to save the game. I would still not recommend picking this game up, at least for now, that is.ORIGINAL POST: Now that the October Patch is out and now that I've played some more of it, I will give my current thoughts on Delver. The good news is that the developer has revamped the RPG system. The bad news is that I still don't see it being a good game any time soon. My reasons? Lets start with the gameplay. The gameplay of Delver may have been expanded upon when it comes to the RPG system, but the gameplay still pretty much sucks♥♥♥♥♥ This time, the game has a shop and gold, and it saves your gold count when you die so that you can use that gold at the shop before entering the dungeon, which sounds nice, but can be used to break the game. How? By saving a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money (lets say about a little over a thousand gold) through multiple playthroughs and using that money to buy jars of skill, a type of item that sells for 20 gold and levels you up upon use, you can easilly kill the difficulty. Some may argue to not use them, seeing as they are optional, but they are in the game, and I feel that they shouldn't be that easy to get, seeing as this game is supossed to be a difficult action rogue-like RPG. In terms of combat, I think it's actually clunkier than the last time I played it, especially when it comes to the hit detection. There were moments in the game where I was hitting enemies, but the hit didn't register for any good particular reason. This was especially common with magic attacks. Speaking of magic, for some reasons, magic weapons seem to be quite overpowered, killing a lot of enemies in one hit. The game also has moments of being unbalanced, as I've had moments on the first floor where I got killed in one hit. The developer still hasn't added the ability to use the scroll wheel, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, considering how many other First-Person RPGs make use of the scroll wheel to change weapons and items. The game also still likes to spawn very powerful equipment in early stages, though not as often as it did when I last played it, so that's a plus. In the end, however, the bad still outweighs the good, and Delver still feels like a generic Action-RPG with nothing going for it.Presentation wise, the game has made drastic changes with its visuals, and although I'm not too fond of these new visuals, they are ♥♥♥♥ tons better than the graphics that Delver used to have (seriously, those graphics were an eye sore). Music wise, Delver still has that god awful dungeon music, although the update added a new tune that is more pleasant to the ears to fit the shop camp that is outside the dungeon. An improvement in these areas, but they could still be better.And now, the performance. I don't know about anyone elses experience, but I found that the game is glitchier then when I last played it. Yeah, not a good thing at all. I had one moment in the game where I found a bow that was floating midair, and I couldn't take it for some reason. I even have the image to prove it. The game also loves to close on its own, as the game closed on me while I was in the dungeon. Also, the game is still unoptimized as ♥♥♥♥. Despite its improvements, the game is still rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and I still think that people should avoid this game at this point in time.			"

Early Access Review
								I really like the optics, the athmosphere and the basic gameplay of Delver.It has four main problems:1: Arrows stack. Well, that is some do some don't. Arrows you buy at a marchant can only stack up to two arrows wich is not very helpfull at all. Some other arrows do stack though and sometimes it looks like arrows you pickd up again (a feature i really like) stack with arrows they haven't stacked with before. No idea what is going on there but it isn't very helpfull.2: Collision Detection for Arrows is terribble. That means that on several of enemys hitting the Sprite doesn't actually hit the enemy. On other enemys it's a game of luck if the arrow damages the enemy upon contact or just flys trough. This is seriously frustrat5ing especially when you want to concentrate on playing with bows and because you need to use all reserves avaiable to you to get trough the game. This leads to problem two.3: This game sooner or later is a game of attrition. Sooner or later you are going to die simply because the ressources like food and or potions aren't nearly enough to get you trough. Especially potions are superrare and you need at least one to even find out what they do because the potions change functions between attempts to master the dungeon. What in one session was a health potion could be poison or a magepotion in the next session. Together with problem one, the lacking collision detection this leads to a slow grind to death.4: The roquelike elements aren't good enough because they aren't really persistent. The point of games like these is that although you die you gain somethinmg from your try at the dungeon that helps you within your next attempt. In Delver this is gold, if you die you get to use the gold you had in your inventorey on the next cahracter and nothing else. This is a problem. Logically you could say that it would bring you forward for your next character so you can buy items to maybe master the dungeon this time.The problem is that you can only buy temporary items that dissapear with your next death. This would mean that you have to do several runs just to grind out gold for that on round that you maybe, maybe not, get trough the dungeon with. That would be if the avaiable items could make a hug impact, wich they don't because they are standart items you could easily find in the dungeon itself. A seller a few levels down selss actually experience potions wich practically means you are buying levels. But they cost 250 Gold per potion and that means a whole lot of goldgrinding runs to maybe be able to buy enough so that it has an impact.Delver clearly needs more persistent rewards that carry over between deaths.Now, why do i still recommend this game?Well, as Delver is kinda in endless Early Access there is hope these things can change. But my bigger reason is that despite the mentioned flaws i honestly have to say that i had a lot of fun for the money the game has cost and that i still feel that i will come back to the game here and there to have some atmospheric, simple fun playing it.

								Delver is a first person action rogue-like where you are delving into a dungeon to fetch the orb and ascend.... Essentially this is Rogue if Rogue was a first person action game. You use various weapons, wands, potions, and food as to transverse down different styles of levels fighting various enemies - some that fly!Some of the best things about this game though is that it does well to allow for pattern recognition from enemies - allowing for skill players to dispatch enemies with deft movement and attacks. Its traps can be somewhat simple, but they can sometimes lead to some interesting situations - and a clever player can always 'trigger' them before stepping on them.In many ways, this is a very simple game as far as first person action rogue-likes go, and it has been somewhat slow to develop - being in Early Access long after Barony for instance was done. It doesn't have multiplayer and it can feel somewhat easy to play and should be easily beaten within the first few tries by more competent players. There is perhaps a bit of a lack in what you can do and experience for the price tag of the game.Overall I do recommend this game, though I wish there was more depth to it. As it is now it lacks somewhat in replayability - which for many players is going to be a glowing problem. But it does have the potential to be a fun little game to play if develop continues on it.

								It's technically in ""early access"" but still better than many of the ""complete"" games out there (I'm looking at you, Necropolis, you ♥♥♥♥ing utterly bland, generic, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥. Rant aside, this is a fairly flipping fun first-person dungeon crawler. Encouraged by the fact the devs are still working on it- though even before this recent update it was still good IMO. High replay value, and visual/audio style done well for its genre. I haven't played entirely through this builld yet but so far it's nice. It's one of those games I can imagine myself picking up and playing years later for fun and it not losing any of the charm. Check out Barony if you like this- they're roughly the same type of game but both definitely worth owning.			"

								What I liked about this game... Hmm let me start with the graphics. This game took the cake with the pixely graphics, the look of the pixels the animation blend so well together. You wouldn't expect that with most pixel styled games, half the time the animations are stiff, but this game puts it together beautifully! Next is the action. This isn't a crazy action game, more like a stroll through a dangerous and mysterious dungeon! Yes you encounter multiple enemies and hack and slash at them, very good action content. But at some points you can just admire your surroundings. But watch out for traps! Overall this game is very replayable and enjoyable. I recommend this game to all who enjoy a good roguelike action game with beautiful pixel styled art.			"

								So I just played and finished my very first game of this. And I have to say it's really really fun, even at such an early point in development. It was incredibly tense when I was fighting my way through the enemies in an attempt to reach the surface, using what small resources I had left after getting to the bottom of the dungeon. And the gameplay is just what I want from this kind of Roguelike, you have to learn everything and aren't spoonfed information, you'll have no idea what a Potion does until you drink it, which is great, you can be on very low health and be in the situation of ""If I drink this potion will it heal me, or kill me"". Learning how attacks interact with each other is fun as well, I used a potion on a Pressure Plate and it exploded, which led me into learning that hitting a potion on the floor turns it into a bomb, very useful considering how far you can throw items. Or that if your Magic Attack hits an Enemies Magic Attack, it will explode both and deal AoE damage. The only thing I never actually figured out was what the Agility stat did. The graphics, which some would call ""Lazy"", fit the style and genre of the game perfectly because in a Roguelike you don't want to be overloaded with details you want everything to be fairly simple, but good looking, which is what this game achieves. While the graphics aren't realistic, they present a great atmosphere for the game and really help with immersion.The Music is also good, it just quitely sits in the background and blends well with the ambient sounds, not drowning out anything important such as the movement or chatter of enemies.Things I would like to see in the future of this game are:- More varied qualities to accessories, weapons and armour. Like qualities that affect gameplay in a more meaniingful way than just stat changes. Depending how it would influence how the game plays.- Perhaps a way to make potions, using ingredients that you don't know what they do until you use them.- Perhaps a way of recharging wands, as I tended to end up carrying 6 wands around and throwing them away once one ran out. That would mean making wands a bit rarer though.- Some ways to specialise as a character, maybe a class system that have different starting stats and items?- And maybe... mod support if possible? When the game is finished of course.Overall though, even lacking some of the things I would like, this game is incredibly fun and I will probably continue to play it for a while, especially as more updates come.

								Bought this for sale 66% off at $2.50ish during a steam sale. I think this was money well spent for the hour or so of enjoyment I got out of the game. Even buying it at full price, it would have paid for itself.The combat is pretty basic but it works well for the slow paced combat. The visuals are very reminiscent of Minecraft along with all the controls. The inventory system works well for allowing you to collect loot along your trip down the dungeon and the randomized potions give a little risk to using them each time you restart, which is frustrating but in a good way.As for faults, the level/stat system is a little broken as you only need to put points into health for the first five levels and defense the rest to become relatively hard to kill. Ranged combat versus flying enemies, which is when it's needed, is a fools game unless you're using a lightning wand (almost hit scan), as projectiles have travel time and flying enemies juke around way too much to predict their movements. I just found myself running up under them and stabbing upward for a sure hit.Finally, while I died the first time down the dungeon due to trying to figure out the system, I beat the game on the second try. I received a slash screen of text and then the game treated me like I had died. I'm pretty much not going down a third time until there are further updates, but as I said at the start, I got my money's worth already and I recommend a purchase, especially if it's on sale again.TL;DR - It's an enjoyable game but has it's issues.

								I just started delving into Delver and the game is simply fantastic. The game plays as a soft first-person roguelike with beautiful execution that takes the complex tunnels and potion identifying of traditional games in the genre and simplifies and amplifies it, and assuming with updates from the developer it's only going to get better as time goes on. On top of all this the games pixel art is pleasing to the eye (if you don't mind the occasional excessive blockiness) and the music is soothing, atmospheric, and catchy. If you are a fan of roguelikes and haven't delved into Delver already, you are doing yourself a disservice.			"

								It took only a few minutes for me to fall in love with this game.  There is a quality to it that is somewhat difficult to put your finger on at first, but I would be describe the environment as being almost perfect.While this game is a roguelike (yes, yes someone is always going to complain about how this isn't a pure roguelike) when I first loaded the game I felt flashes of playing the Secret of Mana for the first time.  A combination of the music, the art, the very simple UI, and carefully timed, if simple, combat hit me right in the nostalgia.Currently it is in beta, and there is much content I have yet to explore, but there is only one shortcoming I see so far.  I want multiplayer.  I don't care what it takes, quadruple the difficulty per person, but I would absolutely love to have multiplayer.  I'll pay for multiplayer DLC, whatevs.I highly recommend this game.			"

								Incredibly hard, crazy rogue-like, with a variety of terrain, weapons, and other items. A fresh take on the rogue-like genre, being in first person. Started out as a post on tigsource, updating almost every day. Now on steam early-access, with sparse updates.Pros:•Of all the rogue-likes I've played, this one is probably the most achievable whilst still being difficult.•Variety of weapons and other helpful items that you can dual wield, with an alright variety of monsters and terrain. •A nice atmosphere, without a simple story to discover through notes on the ground.•A hack 'n' slash, but very well done in first person mode.•Simple, but very replayable.Cons:•Horrible, horrible, textures, read below for info on how to get past that.•Somewhat disappointing boss, which can be good for those who aren't up to the challenge. Just don't get hit, which is pretty easy.•Once you kill the boss, you have to work your way back up the 8 floors you just traveled, which can be somewhat boring.8/10, but if you want to enjoy it, get the official texture pack that has the original textures from the game when it was on tigsource, which are far better than this crunchy-pixel crap. The texture pack is updated with every update, and has optional ""mods"" that slightly improve generation.			"

								A game that is as much about luck as it is about knowing what to do. Sometimes you can reach the end (which can be done within thirty minutes or so) with rubbish gear and lots of food, and other times you will reach it decked in prime gear but no food or wands to help outwith the next step. While it is a fun pick me up, to say it is anythign moret han that for now is overselling it. It has lots of potential, but the potential needs to be fully utilized. After aboutthe six hours i played, my desire to play more has not really increased, still hoping for more. For now, I recommend on the condition that it is 50- 75% off.			"

								Excellent game! Very fun first person dungeon crawling action, with rouge-like elements! It's only in beta at the moment, and it has so much to offer. Currently, I have only been to level three (twice) and have never seen the same dungeon room twice out of my hours of gameplay. If you like games like Diablo, or torchlight, and want a simplified yet really fun version, pickup this game! There is even a texture pack for it on bdcraft.net for 2 dollars (same people who make the popular minecraft texture pack ""Sphax"") Enjoy!			"

								Well, here are my first impressions from Delver:I was watching it for quite some time now. I have played a little over an hour or so, and I can safely say that I'm glad I bought this game! It will bring back memories to the people that have played Eye of the Beholder, Wizardry and other first person dungeon crawlers. Personally, it reminds me a little bit about Heretic, but that's maybe because of the ""crunchy pixels"". Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the graphics! These days there are alot of indie games that use pixel art graphics, but few have done it as good as this game's artist. I have seen the previous art for the game. It was cool, but now this current pixel art is awesome!I'm at level 7 of the dungeon on my first go and what I can say is that it really gets tough after the first few levels.Being an early access game, Delver lacks some cool features that will be awesome if implemented, but that doesn't have to stop you getting it. Updates will bring you new stuff, so don't hesitate.One sentence opinion: Awesome game! Buy it and enjoy! "

My dream for a final version is for this to basically be the first person real-time version of DC:SS.  More enemies, more weapons and armor, more scrolls and potions, mutations, races and classes with unique skills and attributes, deeper more varied dungeons, etc.  A lot to ask, but I dont think I'd ever stop playing if it happened.

Good sense of exploration. Funny physics. Easy but varying combat.Cons: Repetetive very quickly. Combat only changes based on enemy. Would like to see: Perks and powers that you can use.

								For me, Delver seems to have hit the difficulty sweet spot for roguelikes. While I may die on some runs out of carelessness, I'll usually return to the surface successfully in Delver. That's something I can't say about any other Retrieve-The-Orb games.Maybe it's because this game is a first-person action game, something that roguelikes usually aren't. I personally find it more engaging to play. Which means I'll play it more, and thus be more successful more often.What's really amazing is that this game isn't finished, yet it is already extremely fun to play. A great example of what an Early Access game should be.			"

Switching what's in your offhand is cumbersome--I'd love a way to quickly switch from candle to buckler and back--and the mini map is essentially useless. Also, I'd love a slightly bigger combat belt. Even one more slot would make a world of difference. Thanks for such a fantastic game! I look forward to future updates!			"

								This game executes the basic functions of a rouge like pretty damn well. There is no complexity to it such as with its rouge like bretheren such as FTL or Rouge Legacy (not to say either of those are overly complex), but that doesn't mean this game is not good on its own. Its refreshing to have such a simple experience and goal. The game is, to me, reminicent of an old arcade machine. It is the same thing everytime and is pretty basic, but its fun nonetheless. I also bought this game a few years ago before it was on steam and now coming back to it I love what I see. Not only has so much progress been made but the developers have keept the game to its true rouge like qualities! As a big fan of dungeon crawlers like this I highly advise anyone like myself to stop in and give Delver a try!			"

								Delver, the Early Access Rogue-Like RPG.I saw this game and it sparked my interest because it reminded me a little of Might and Magic World of Xeen. Then upon realizing it was a first person rogue-like game and not the typical side scrolling one, I had to get it.The game looks and play beautifully, I changed the key bindings a little more to my tastes but it probably won't bother most on its default settings. On the games website you can buy a HD Sphax PureBD pack (You might recognize the name from the popular Minecraft Texture pack) for $4.90 (2.90€).  The game should be able to run on any computer than can use Steam, due to the simplistic graphics and the slider in the menu. As far as the Rogue aspect of the game, it does it a little differently than say, Rogue Leacy. In that game, you only get the gold from each run to spend as you have to spend it all to enter the castle. But in Delver, you keep all of your gold from each run, but lose any equipment that you got. But once you buy something, you always have it, which is nice. You level up in the dungeon and have a series of classic RPG stats that you can increase, but Health should always be your number 1 priority when leveling as it was the only one that had a major difference to difficulty/gameplay. I got lucky on my longest run and found a warhammer with long reach and high damage. The wands you find will be very useful and they are the only way to get passed something that can happen in the game. Speed is probably the least useful stat in the game especially when matched against Health. I'd like to see a little more depth in the stats.I really didn't notice any bugs that stopped my progress in the game and I could honestly see this game, in its current phase of development, packaged as a full game, I would certainly buy it again. 10/10 and good on the Devs.			"

								A solid rogue-like with an appropriate amount of content for a Beta. A solid variety of weaponry and enemies allow for several hours of fun, afterwards it gets rather repetitive. But hopefully more content will be added soon after this long hiatus.Immediately you're cast in the dungeon and it's up to you to learn, and until you do learn, it's trial and error which will lead to death. Once finished, the game doesn't offer any much more to do.The combat is fun, though you have to be aware of the attack speed of each weapon, as well as their damage output and the enemy you're up against. All potions are unknown until drunk, once or several times. This adds an additional risk because you might end up commiting suicide.The artstyle is enjoyable as is the exploration of randomly generated dungeons.>I'd give it a 6.5/10, it's a solid pickup on sale, fully priced only if they add more>Pros: random dungeons, combat is okay, risky potions increase difficulty, stats matter, quickly load your saves>Cons: you can only change options from the Main Menu, you'll find it difficult to get used to how inventory and items work, prone to using items accidentally(ie. pressing the wrong hotbar key will eat the item instantly rather than selecting it)			"

								This game is great for what it is worth but i've a load of issues with this game-the game can throw you some rather unfair bull like the staff fighters that spam leap attack you-flying creatures .... you can not jump in this game because space bar is also an attack buttion along with mouse 1 so if your in a large room with no wands no arrows and a flying creature you just gotta forget 'bout them and hope they don't suddenly desiced to rush you when your back is turned-wands and leveling up    you can boost you movement speed,swing speed,heath,armor, or blow it on 1 more shot with the wands you have    ONE AND ONLY ONE EXTRA SHOT great sooo worth the point-wizards namely the snipers of the game with all the 20 health with like 10 armor to 9 health in one shot bull unless your lucky to get an anti magic bottle-scrolls like super amaing powers? here is your  one use and never see it again magic paper-loads of lovely gold but were to spend it?    only 2 shops zones exist in this game one in the opening and one in the dungon but the first one has crazy high prices and the other one that CAN i repeat CAN SPAWN in the dungon which is EXTREAMLY rare played like 12 games only once i saw a shop keeper and all he sol were scrolls so yah might as well forget the gold- this game has been available september 6 2013 and has had 9 updates and im wrighting this on may 31 2015 unless this game is being developed by 1 guy i can't see how that few of updates is resonableBut i must give credit were it is due although I seem to hate this game with a white hot fury it is good for what it is worth and i may have to take back most of my rant  that is if the developer is gonna fix and add stuff because i can easly see this game becoming quite popular if it had more real pysical content NOT MODS but in current status it is in I can only borderline recommend this game			"

								An early access game that I actually like? What?! Arrmageddon is near! Human sacrafice! Cats and dogs living together! Mass hysteria!In all seriousness, Delver is a fun dungeon crawling rougue game. The dungeons are randomly generated each time you play making the replayability value high. If you die, you start all over, new dungeons and a new character, but you keep the gold that you find during your last quest(s) so you can purchase weapons, armor, potions, and spells to aid your new character. If I can compare this game to another, Delver reminds me of Ultima Underworld.If you like rougue-type games, this is a must-buy!			"

								Ok, this the kind of game where you start off the first time, and you die within minutes. Then you respawn in the same place, and you do a little bit better. But you still die within minutes. this part isnt very frustrating, its actually really fun. The frustrating part comes when you have  gotten the ythidian orb from the last dungeon, and have almsot escaped  (basically almost beaten the playthrough), and you are rushed by a couple of skulls and a wizard-skeleton and you die within seconds. All of yoor carefully selected gear will not help you. All of your sneaking around, painstakingly rooting through the entire dungeon was for nothing. you are dead. This will cause you to quit the game for at least 10 minutes so you can cool off, but then you will get back on and try again. In the end, its a really fun game.			"

Early Access Review
								Delver, the Early Access Rogue-Like RPG.I saw this game and it sparked my interest because it reminded me a little of Might and Magic World of Xeen. Then upon realizing it was a first person rogue-like game and not the typical side scrolling one, I had to get it.The game looks and play beautifully, I changed the key bindings a little more to my tastes but it probably won't bother most on its default settings. On the games website you can buy a HD Sphax PureBD pack (You might recognize the name from the popular Minecraft Texture pack) for $4.90 (2.90€).  The game should be able to run on any computer than can use Steam, due to the simplistic graphics and the slider in the menu. As far as the Rogue aspect of the game, it does it a little differently than say, Rogue Leacy. In that game, you only get the gold from each run to spend as you have to spend it all to enter the castle. But in Delver, you keep all of your gold from each run, but lose any equipment that you got. But once you buy something, you always have it, which is nice. You level up in the dungeon and have a series of classic RPG stats that you can increase, but Health should always be your number 1 priority when leveling as it was the only one that had a major difference to difficulty/gameplay. I got lucky on my longest run and found a warhammer with long reach and high damage. The wands you find will be very useful and they are the only way to get passed something that can happen in the game. Speed is probably the least useful stat in the game especially when matched against Health. I'd like to see a little more depth in the stats.I really didn't notice any bugs that stopped my progress in the game and I could honestly see this game, in its current phase of development, packaged as a full game, I would certainly buy it again. 10/10 and good on the Devs.			"

Early Access Review
								A pretty casual roguelike experience. As of this post, I played it a few times and quickly made it far; only dying to either burst (Didn't get enough health or armor), or my own stupidity. It's very short, which I suppose is a good thing for a game like this. It's easy, but you still can't face-check anything until you get lucky enough with weapons, armor, and stock piles of food / potions. It does get easier as the game goes on, which is a bad and good thing. The stronger you get, the less trouble you have and are capable of dealing with most creatures. But at the same time, before you get to that stage you struggle and have to back-peddle swing many monsters to survive. You do get a lot of wands I have noticed, which trivializes a lot of encounters; which should be their purpose. But the purpose is way too strong when you get a wand drop every other kill. And the mages almost always drop them, even if they are absolute crap -- it's a ranged weapon and you take 0 damage from back-peddling and killing the enemy.Stats are not very clear on what they do besides Attack, Speed, and Health. It's obvious you deal more damage with Attack, move faster when you up speed, and gain more health everytime you level it up. Agility was very vague on what it did, and I still don't feel the effects. The same goes for defense and magic. They feel either too weak to actually present themselves as useful, or are just not straight forward enough.I would recommend this game on sale. It's a decent time waster for a few hours, but it has very little to give after you play through it just a few times.			"

It is completely playable and fun where it's at so far. Can't wait to see the finished product!			"

								Delver is one of the best dungeon-crawler, first person, action-RPG, roguelike/roguelite avaiable on Steam store.You go rogue in a dungeon looking for a gem, very straight and cliche story, once you get the gem you must get the hell out of the dungeon before the horde of monster gets you. You have a lot of ways on  how to achieve that objective, you can go melee, bows and magic wands. You lv up, get some food potions and everything.....very typical rpg elements.The diference about Delver is that in every run you will find a different dungeon, different upgrades, different items, beside that you will find a very interesting gameplay and the possibilities of modding it...Yes mods will be avaiable, in fact there is 2 or 3 mods that you can try it out.Very recommended for any RPG,first person, dungeon crawler fan.

								Recommended but there's nothing new here. If it ever gets out of 'Early Access' I suspect it will be solid. The biggest appeal for me was the art style. The usual randomly generated levels, items and whatnot are all here. I finished the game but it seemed like it didn't matter how I was playing, it was all up to the numbers and being lucky. Maybe the game is intended for grinding, like a traditional RPG, but I ended up racing down as fast as I could to kill the boss, then snagging the orb and racing back to the surface. Fighting everything didn't really get me anywhere, especially when one little bump can knock you into a pit and that infamous ""permadeath"" everyone seems to love puts you back at square one. Maybe a quick tutorial or in-game guide would have helped me since it seems like there are also a lot of useless items to pick up in the game as well. As far as I could tell you can't sell anything at the shops, so why can I pick up cups and bowls? I dropped a book once that killed me, so maybe that's something. Maybe they're for a future update or maybe I didn't dive deep enough into the game. Either way I finished it, so it doesn't really matter at this point.			"

								Delver is a quick session-friendly action-dungeon-crawler, with inspired and stylish visuals of the schools of old. It's fast paced, challenging and very varied due to its randomized floor layouts. If you ever get tired of the base game, there's level editing tools and the ability to swap out texture packs. A nice, fun, go-to game for when nothing in your library seems all that exciting.			"

								Delver is an interesting game. It's rather basic at the moment, being early access, but for eight dollars, the amount of content and effort that the game has is really impressive, and it feels very focused in its design. I can see the reason people compare it to Ultima Underworld, since much of the game's gameplay and style are clearly very inspired by it - the first one in particular, I mean. While the combat focus is very fun and the graphical style is really appealing, I actually consider the level design and generation to be the highlight here: I don't know whether it's due to working with a 3D space or whether it's simply the sheer amount of rooms and halls and things that the team have made, but in the handful of runs I've played so far, they've all felt similar, but all memorably unique thanks to how everything is built. It's a roguelike capable of creating really cool vistas, structures and views, while also making those distinct in gameplay terms as well (the dungeon is inhabited and has lots of humans and recent structures, the caves are very jagged with lots of nooks, the sewers are a mixture of open yet linear due to multiple heights, etc), and that's something to be applauded.

There are stuff that should be added like achivements and trading cards, choice of character (e.g mage starts with more wants, rouge starts with better daggers, warrior more health and mabye shield........u know what i mean..) but i can expect them to come in later with the updates. Would definitly recomend this game. ^^ 10/10 creative, simplistic and extreamly fun.			"

There might not be enough content right now to warrant multiple playthroughs, but hopefully that will change in the future.			"

								A fairly short FPS roguelike with a Minecraft feel to the graphics and the terrain, as well as the inventory, minus weapon/armor durability, your equipment is indestructible. Except for magic wands/scrolls, which have limited charges but can be very useful.There are also several different colored potions which effects are randomized each playthrough, most of them are helpful, while one of them is poison, so be careful.Then you got your EXP system and leveling up system where you can choose between several stats, I just usually get health every level when I can, you're gonna need it.The general goal is to go down several floors of dungeons, always having the same tileset/theme but a different layout each playthrough, and get the treasure, and then traverse all the way back to camp from where you started as angry monsters chase you after stealing their treasure.A decent enough roguelike, it was fun and lasted about 2 hours so far, going through the game twice. Could use more variety and maybe achievements in the future.			"

								A while ago I played this game for a very short amount of time (about 20 min) and could carely make it past the first cave room. I got frustrated and put this game down only to forget about it and leave it uninstalled in my library for qutie some time until I decided to try again. This experience was much different. For those of you who don't know anything about this game, it is a dungeon crawler roguelike first person rpg with a game play that I like to relate to capture the flag. Once you enter the dungeon, you cannot leave until you recover the red orb about 7 floors down and with each level you go down (randomly generated levels of course), the enemy population and difficulty along with the number of hazards increases. Once you obtain the orb, the whole dungeon goes bat♥♥♥♥♥♥and you have to race to the top. So essentially you must play through each floor except the last floor twice and you will progress further with each playthrough. I cannot express how satisfying it is to obtain a new weapon or level up in a tough situation and every second of this game is worth the price. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves rpgs, dungeon crawlers, roguelike first person, and consider it a must have if you enjoy all of the above.			"

								First play through I made it all the way to the end. I saw the orb. But it was guarded by a baddie that had a mean and deathly look about him. So I pot shot it with a few arrows rather then risk getting walloped up close. Bad idea; this baddie had a affinity toward magic and blasted me with something foul. It was a spell of slowing or something but what do I know I was a warrior not a mage. The damage was little so I figured it was time to bring out old two handed. I hefted my gilded great hammer of fire and walked right up to his ugly face and smashed it in but not before I was hit a few good times. I was alive and the baddie dead so what did I care if I was near death . . . Well turns out this baddie was a lot harder to kill then I thought. His desecrated corps burst forth with some kind of crazy voodoo magic and a bunch of skull wraiths blasted me and I died in seconds.  10/10 would get all the way to the end of the game, die and have to start over again.

								First play through I made it all the way to the end. I saw the orb. But it was guarded by a baddie that had a mean and deathly look about him. So I pot shot it with a few arrows rather then risk getting walloped up close. Bad idea; this baddie had a affinity toward magic and blasted me with something foul. It was a spell of slowing or something but what do I know I was a warrior not a mage. The damage was little so I figured it was time to bring out old two handed. I hefted my gilded great hammer of fire and walked right up to his ugly face and smashed it in but not before I was hit a few good times. I was alive and the baddie dead so what did I care if I was near death . . . Well turns out this baddie was a lot harder to kill then I thought. His desecrated corps burst forth with some kind of crazy voodoo magic and a bunch of skull wraiths blasted me and I died in seconds.  10/10 would get all the way to the end of the game, die and have to start over again.

								I firest heard of this game on the BDCraft Sphax Minecraft page.  (That's the texture pack I use on Minecraft because it looks incredible.)  They have a texture pack for this game.So, I thought it sounded cool, and played it, and it is the Dungeon Master ""realtime"" thing I wanted.  And with the BDCraft texture pack (yes, I paid for that too, because it looks amazing) it just plain looks AMAZING.  See those guys around the campfire?  Yeah, they look like they're from... something else with better graphics (:  Not real, just, you know. Awesome.Anyway this plays like a roguelikelike 3d dungeon crawler should.  You find items, they are sometimes great, you trip traps, you get bit by zombies and you lose life, and you have no food so you die.  You go again and this time you get eaten by a bat.  Then you try again and while trying to reach annoy-o-wizard with your sword, leaving those precious staves with long reach spells in your toolbelt, your head goes 'splode.  It's great and I think I will be playing a TON of this game.Non-Windows people - the bdcraft .exe is just a zip file, use unzip and stick the 'asset' folder in your game dir.  Then ""awesome!"" ensues.			"

								This game truly is amazing. It brings a true feeling of dungeon crawling. Do not be fooled by the pixelated graphics, the game looks stunning. The combination of sprites across the areas make for gorgeous scenery. The enemy sprites are easy to identify and well made. The soundtrack gives a nice feel of adventure. The music remains noted in its glory, but does no distract you from gameplay. The items available are plentiful and well made. The combat is simple enough to adapt to quickly, but still poses some danger when performing it. The game relies heavily on exploration. Notes found in the beginning town give basic instructions to gameplay and an extremely brief lore description that strangely leaves you wanting more, despite being shorter than a paragraph. Not in a long time have I played a game like this, capable of delievering a real feeling of adventure, as well as giving satisfying emotions when discovering new loot. I would recommend this game to any dungeon crawler lover, or someone who simply enjoys a well made adventure game. The fact that I say this now and the game is only in beta truly blows my mind.			"

								First impressions:The art style is fantastic, and the game is very easy to pick up and start playing immediately. The audio (sound effects, music, etc.) is done very well and sounds great. Controls are responsive, and the game feels very well optimized (no lag in any areas). My favorite aspect of the game is definetly the animations. The death animations are extremely well done and make me smile every time I get a kill.After ~4 hours gameplay:Definitely one of the best rogue-like games I've played. The game just excels on so many levels. From my understanding, the goal of the game is to make it to the bottom level of the dungeon, retrieve an item, and make your way back topside to exit the dungeon. Each level has a set of stairs leading deeper into the dungeon, and each level down gets increasingly diffucult. The first few levels are easy; the real challenge starts to come around the ruins level - the farthest I have gotten in my playthroughs. This deep down, new obstacles start to appear that really display the depth of the game. Some of these include platforms that fall after being walked on, pillars that drop down to crush you, and others. There are also many more enemies tightly packed together compared to the early levels. The levels are randomly generated, with a mix of some prefab areas and it works well.I would definitely recommend supporting the developers and picking up this game in early access. I came across the game completely by accident while prowling the creative section of twitch.tv, and the art developer (Joshua) is friendly and responsive. Well worth the cheap price.			"

								Sure, it's a rogue-y dungeon crawler, but it never feels like you're DOING anything besides dying and trying again. There needs to be a reason your new character went in and died. Saving gold so you can buy something ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for somebodies run is pointless. I once saved 300+ gold up and bought a sword at the beginning before even starting the dungeon. I then immediatly found a better weapon. There needs to be upgrades that stay between characters or SOMETHING. The game feels pointless and unfinished in it's current state.			"

								Very good game, the combat is good. It is pretty easy for the most part on the way in, it is getting out that is the hardest part. Now it can lag a bit when you maximize the screen or fullscreen it, so warning you there. However, a good, scratch that great game overall. Can't wait till the next updates come. We definitely need different dungeons, a difficulty system, more exploration around the upper world (as well as a key that will be given to the player if he deals with a challenge of some kind to get into the other dungeons, such as a guardian, a riddle, a puzzle, something) a better variety of enemies, and a hardcore adventurer option just a few examples of some changes to make it better.

								This is honestly one of the best rouge-likes ive ever played. Ive played through this game a ton of times and still havent beaten it. in spite of that, it still manages to keep its charm and not give the player (or at least me) any frustration. i feel like this is because of the games fairness, meaning, that each death feels justified in its own way. another good aspect of this game is its 3D environment. putting you into the action in first person has to be the best idea ive seen so far since ive never seen that in a rouge-like before. The 16-bit enemies and environment add a classic feeling to the experience almost as though the game was once in a fourth directional dungeon crawler like ""Link to The Past"". The randomized floors just add a bit more of anticipation to each floor. each enemy is unique in its own while still keeping a theme throughout the game. overall it is just an enjoyable experience and i always look forward to each gameplay and that is why i recommend this game to any interested. PLEASE DON'T BE HESITANT TO BUY THIS GAME.			"

								The idea of a first person rogue-like is a simple one with very few competent examples.Delver is not a competent example.Yes it works, but it's so content malnourished I'm pretty sure I finished it within an hour and found no additional goals.Combat is basic as all hell, with the only spell being ""wands"" that have limited uses, all shoot generic bolts of various degrees of uselessness and weigh your limited inventory down like nobodies business.Avoid this game until it's content gets improved, or unless you can pick it up for 50 cents.

								While the game seems interesting as a minecraft looking roguelike dungeon crawler, the gameplay just isn't there.  Combat is simplistic, the dungeons are relatively boring and fairly linear (with side paths branching to dead ends), and overall it just feels very repetitious with no payoff.  Add to that a lack of most options (Just resume and quit from the escape menu in game) and a major lack of updates and you get an unfinished game that doesn't look to be ever completed.  To put it in perspective, this game has been around since 2013 with the last update coming almost a year ago and is still labeled as a beta in early access.  Much larger (and better) games have joined and left early access than this and it's a shame since I could imagine this game fleshing out into something akin to fun.  Unless this game gets a much needed update/expansion/revision, save your money and get something like Legend of Grimrock.			"

								Delver, while still in developement, is a great game. The game itself is a dungeon rouge-like, but is a first person game. One could say that Delver resembles Minecraft in quite a few ways, and I don't disagree. But, it's far from another Mincraft clone. The premise of the game is simple, the difficulty is not. As of this writing, the dungeon consists of seven levels/floors, each randomly generated. One must make it to the bottom, then return topside with the treasure, with various enemies being thrown at you along the way. However, the game does become monotonous at times, just to let you know. Again, it may sound like a cake-walk to some, but it really is the opposite. And although I'm used to multitudes of horror films, I jump every once and a while as a turn a corner. Recommended.			"

								Delver is half nostalgia bomb, and half modern fun.It reminds me of Ultima while being hilariously colourful, with cheerful music. It's a Tiny game MB wise, but is packed with nothing but fun. At the same time though, it's horribly difficult for newer players. It doesn't let you save and continue, and the only thing that seems to transfer when you die is gold. Not an issue at all, as the game is very addictive, and you just want to try one more time.

My only Cons are that there are no ways to sell items so it is pointless to carry more then 1 weapon and you cant recharge wands making them pointless to keep after use. If this game could take concepts and ideas from the Pixel Dungeon mobile game it would be even for worth it but as it is, wait for a sale. This is not worth its fullprice right now but i will say that this game has ALOT of potential to be something amazing!			"

								Delver is a roguelike that is visually similar to all those loveable first person games with billions of sprites (Minecraft, Doom, Wolfenstein etc).As far as gameplay goes, it's a dungeon crawler where you pick up loot and put on the best stuff so that you can KILL MORE MOBS! Aside from that, there is nothing terribly exciting about this game. Combat is boring, there is nothing innovative, and there is nothing really driving me to keep playing. It's not a great roguelike, it's not a great RPG, it's not a great first person shooter/fighter.10 minutes of playtime will show you everything there is to know. Don't bother getting Delver.			"

								An aweomse time-killer. Good for a long play or a short term play. Seems to hit just the right tone for difficulty, where it gets harder later on, but is not overly punishing at the start (No spawn deaths.). Has really fantastic music and a charming graphical style that reminds me of the old 3D games of the 90's but done in a higher resolution. Very charming, fantastic game and worth every penny.			"

								This game is good overall, but it has a serious issue of creating unpassable routes. A half wall appearing in your only way forward thus not allowing you to move forward is game breaking, if you can't progress there's no point in the game. Hopefully they fix this issue soon and I can change this to a reccomendation. As of now though, a broken game is broken, do not buy.			"

								Though I did enjoy the game, it can be beaten in under 4 hours and the replay value is somewhat disappointing.   I can't recommend this game for over $5 mainly because of its lack of content.  Level-up's are decently-timed, but stat increases often mean nothing (dumping points into Health = always winning).  The game needs to be much longer, and stat increases need to have a much larger impact on the game and its enemies.  You often find yourself randomly finding a nice strong sword within the first few levels and watching the game become extremely easy thereafter.			"

								Amazing graphix style, lacks content Delver is fun little game where you delve into a dungeon fighting monsters and a boss. The thing is, it has a serious lack of content. I would only reccomend this game on sale beceause spending 8 euro's on just two hours of gametime is not worth it in my opinion (a friend of mine completed the game in 0.9 hours without rushing it).The graphix style is amazing. I am a fan of game design in general and this has a serieus amount of potential. The main problem with the game is, as mentioned, the lack of content. As you enter the first dungeon, 'Dungeon 01' will appear on your screen. This gave me the idea there are at least 11 dungeons. Wrong. There is only 1. One single dungeon with only nine floors. If the devs would add at least 10 more dungeons of different styles, I would change my opinion. For now, do not buy this game unless you are curious about the design and need an hour to kill.3/10, potential but propably dead devs.			"

								This is retro-style first-person dungeon crawler. It's a very straightforward and fluid experience. The combat is fast, smooth and fun. The loot is plentiful and interesting. Everything serves a purpose and it's easy to figure out what everything does.However, despite the straightforwardness, this is very much a rogue-like. Strong monsters are deadly accurate with attacks and are intelligent. Casters will avoid melee and attempt to kite you. Melee enemies will attempt to flank you. Your skills will be tested and it honestly feels like a match of Quake 3 at times. This is a game you can play for 10 minutes or 10 hours and still lose track of time.			"

								 Positive Aspects: Delver is a beautiful game, and I love how immursive it can be at times. I love the loot you can collect in the game.  Negative Aspects: The game is quite repetative, and really there is no point to play over and over. The game is still glitchy, and at random times you can die, or in worse cases loose your progress. The only reason why this game that gets a negative response from me is because how much I hate the general gameplay. Don't get me wrong I love the look at the game and the flow of the game, but I feel like the game is the most tedious game I have ever played!  "

								3/5 Delver is a randomly-generated, first-person dungeon-crawler where you try to traverse a cave system to find a magical orb and bring it back outside.Again, it's one of those games that you stop enjoying once you learn how to beat it and then you just breeze through it with minimal effort. The game has low replayability, but I will say it was fun for the first hour or two, but afterwards, I was like ""Okay, I beat it. I'm never playing this game agian."" It's not a bad game at all, but I can't honestly recommend it. It was a fun little adventure for an hour or two but it got old quickly.			"

								Overall the game is okay, a very basic ""rogue-like-lite"". It suffers from being a bit weak in scope, but the gameplay is tight. The ending is unbearably annoying, and only has one real playstyle you can do to beat it. I can only suggest the game for $2 or less.If you've ever played a ""real"" rogue-like, like Nethack (or other ASCIIs) you'll be very disappointed. The game is incredibly limited, the ""RPG"" element is ultrabasic, with only 2-3 stats actually being useful. There is no character magic, and the game scales pretty linearly. I actually got more out of building up in the first or second dungeons, because while deeper levels bring harder enemies, the rewards are worse.The author put in official mod support, though there is no Steam Workshop. I did not try any of that.Note on other's reviews: Only the first and second dungeons are ""procedurally generated"" in the normal sense. The others are randomized, but not completely random. It makes the game more interesting, but there are next to no items and as mentioned.			"

								A Fantastic game, full of secrets and suprises, epic loot, and wonderfully composed music to listen to while cutting down the monster hoardes! Add random dungeon generation and you have a well polished game fit for any player who dares to venture into the depths of the dungeon. I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a good Dungeon Crawler or anyone who wants a game they can play again and again.			"

								Overall the game is okay, a very basic ""rogue-like-lite"". It suffers from being a bit weak in scope, but the gameplay is tight. The ending is unbearably annoying, and only has one real playstyle you can do to beat it. I can only suggest the game for $2 or less.If you've ever played a ""real"" rogue-like, like Nethack (or other ASCIIs) you'll be very disappointed. The game is incredibly limited, the ""RPG"" element is ultrabasic, with only 2-3 stats actually being useful. There is no character magic, and the game scales pretty linearly. I actually got more out of building up in the first or second dungeons, because while deeper levels bring harder enemies, the rewards are worse.The author put in official mod support, though there is no Steam Workshop. I did not try any of that.Note on other's reviews: Only the first and second dungeons are ""procedurally generated"" in the normal sense. The others are randomized, but not completely random. It makes the game more interesting, but there are next to no items and as mentioned.			"

								Great fun with lots of potential.  Fiendishly difficult as a Rogue should be:  you will DIE & you will LOVE it.  Charming atmosphere makes the world feel realistic, inviting, & later thrilling.  From the lovely Bard at the begining & throughout, the music is very enjoyable.  The ability to increase speed at level up, & the magic wands scattered about the dungeon are especially enjoyable.  I am quite pleased to be on board for Delver beta. -- If you enjoy slaying monsters in ""Minecraft"" but hate the platforming, ""Delver"" is for you.			"

								Development isn't entirely abandoned, but a safe bet would be to say no new substantive update would come out this year at all. Go ahead and look for the company's twitter and the dates/frequency/content of posts if you wnat to get a better idea. Dont let the ""Early Access"" label get your hopes up. Assume this is all you will ever get. At the very least, it needs some optimization updates. This could vary machine to machine but just because your computer is othewise pretty good at what should be harder to process doesnt mean you wont get jarring stutters in this game. Reduction of particles does next-to-nothing to aleviate. There isn't even an update to change the pixel resolution at full screen, or any control customization/mouse sensitivity options whatsoever.Beyond that, the game does have interesting aesthetics but with enemies that could best be described as an annoyance, with melee combat that feels more like a batting range with softballs. Maybe you wont regret buying it on a Steam sale, but if you're budget is 20-30 bucks for the whole sale, look elsewhere.			"

								best 8 dollars ive ever spent. gets that dungeon crawler feel just right while providing a different experience ever time you play! While it is fairly difficult to get out of the dungeon its a great time running through caves and sewers fighting off giant worms and spiders like nothing, then hearing the flying octopus and running for cover before it can get a shot off at you. -10/10 would die from skeletons after getting orb againDid i mention the potions are randomized every time too? really need that health potion but dont know which potion it is?

								Awesome, challenging, but sometimes repetitive. I enjoyed the hours of playing in Delver. The best part for me was the environment. It’s what I fell in love with and sadly the only part I fell in love with. Since it’s still under development, I have high hopes for Delver. Respawning when you die with just the starting items and the low reward for getting further into the dungeon kills half of the fun for me. The challenging aspect of Delver was perfect. It did not give you a easy run in any aspect so you really had to work for that extra exp or extra gold from the enemies inside the dungeon.

								I had to write a review, complled to do so. Lets start out with the music , its pleasnt and engages your curiosity while delving deep in the unexplored nooks and crannys of the dungeons. Graphix is fitting for this style game, a interesting mix of 2d and 3d. The dungeon environment is asthetically pleasing to the eye and done extreemly well. From the flickering of a torch to the pixilated blood splattered against the wall after a heated battle.  As a  36 year old gamer , this game takes me back to the golden era of the great RPG's , an era unfortunatly that has been long forgotten. Add some achievements and a endless dungeon mode or challenge modes and this game will be arround to stay! In beta this game is fantastic and really shows a level of creativity that few can match. I would recommend this game to anyone!			"

If you dump all your stat points into health you'll never have to use a restorative item, ever. You'd have to put genuine effort into dying. Monster AI is boring. The gear is boring. Too many wands spawn. I'd like to see more hidden entrances, unique monsters, unique items, etc. The rollover gold is dumb. I'd rather have no gold at all or have shops inside the dungeon.			"

February 1, 2014. and its just finally getting an acceptable amount of content, despite still being the world's most 2 dimensional ""roguelike"".you want this? buy it there, and give them 2 bucks. thats what this is worth, a toilet/coffee break phone game with little to no thought or challenge, just some colors to keep you distracted for 5 minutes.""Delver is a first person action roguelike dungeon crawl with crunchy pixels""what they really should say is""Delver is all the fun of killing the same enemies, over and over, with none of the statistics, character choices, challenge, loot, special items, and special encounters that make roguelikes fun. as a matter of fact, zelda has more roguelike elements, just go play that game instead.""why am i updating this? because they just released a mini update 2 months ago, explaining that they are not responsible for their game and providing customers with a good product, and after being out of ""hiatus"", we're right back into it. i am utterly disgusted with their whimsical game development style and frivolity at my expense. have fun guys, thats the last dollar i ever give to you.

								I had to write a review, complled to do so. Lets start out with the music , its pleasnt and engages your curiosity while delving deep in the unexplored nooks and crannys of the dungeons. Graphix is fitting for this style game, a interesting mix of 2d and 3d. The dungeon environment is asthetically pleasing to the eye and done extreemly well. From the flickering of a torch to the pixilated blood splattered against the wall after a heated battle.  As a  36 year old gamer , this game takes me back to the golden era of the great RPG's , an era unfortunatly that has been long forgotten. Add some achievements and a endless dungeon mode or challenge modes and this game will be arround to stay! In beta this game is fantastic and really shows a level of creativity that few can match. I would recommend this game to anyone!			"

								This game feels complete, despite still being worked on. Essentially. Minecraft-esque graphics but more of an First Person Dungeon Crawler. Random Dungeons, Random Monsters & Humans to fight, and just.. a whole lot of random. Random drops..random random! Love it. I think the only thing it's lacking is more random. Give me MOAR ha, we'll see how it progresses but I do enjoy it despite some.. awkward glitches.. like flying into the ceiling for no apparent reason and the hitbox on things like Arrows & wands is sometimes seeming too much.. while in other areas, too little. Quite Confusing. Either way. Fun stuff. Check it out if you want. It's worth the on sale price :P			"

								This game is definately worth boying. Its a realy good make of some old style dungeon crawlers. As well the game even from the very begining was very well recieved and has a good number of followers. The Developer did an amazing job on this and is still working to make it an even better game. It also allows for modding, as well as player made maps. I have a feeling that this game will also eventually have a spot in the workshop.  If your not impressed by the trailer look at some gameplay or even check out the early versions of the game if they are still available. You'll see that this is a game that you'll love. The best part is even if you get bored of it now, in a month or two the game will have changed so much that its almost a new game all by its self.Have fun!			"

								If you enjoy dungeon crawling and rougelike games, you will like this a lot. It's features fun combat with procederaly generated maps (that are well designed). Runs are about 30 minutes to an hour + long depending on map layout and any gold you didn't spend that run gets carried over to your next one (Note that runs you did on save file x wont transfer to save file y or z). Beware the sewers however, I have gotten stuck on something there quite a few times and had to abandon my runs. Teleport scrolls are handy for this, but if you don't have one you might be able to get out by throwing out potions and smacking them (Hold w while doing this, also this doesn't work if you are stuck in the geometry or the floor your trying to get to is 2 stories high). The music is also really good. Rate 7/10.			"

								I'm going to preface this review with a disclaimer: This game is very unfinished and while I will recommend it, you should be willing to buy a game that may not get all of the features it promises. I bought the game on sale and I do not regret my purchase. No onto the review.This game, while being described as an action roguelike, is not a roguelike, but a rogue-like-like. It has some roguelike elements but it's missing some of the soul and core mechanics that roguelikes are supposed to have. That doesn't mean it's a bad game, but you should consider this before buying.The basic concept of the game is simple: Delve into the dungeon, make it to the bottom, grab the treasure and escape alive. There are enemies and traps along the way to stop you of course, and the twist of needing to escape with your life adds more difficulty and stress to an otherwise easy game. If you've played a lot of rogue-like-likes before you shouldn't find it too hard to make it to the bottom and beat the boss, but making it back should prove a lot harder. Besides the dungeon, there is also a camp area. The camp area lets you spend your collected gold after you die to start off a run with an item, or items. These items should not be ignored and can give you a very helpful early game advantage. This is a good touch, although I wish more was done with it and the NPCs there. But remeber: The game is still in dev.Overall I'd say Delver is a potentially deep and interesting rogue-like-like with cool ideas, and is worth sticking with for the features planned in the future. The developer has plans to add a lot more depth in items, magic, enemies, character classes and even an overworld with NPCs.			"

								This game is looking very promising for those who want a ""crunchy 3d"" action RPG version of the old UNIX game 'rogue'. Right now I think the mechanics seem a little simplistic and I'd currently say that it's about at the level of sophistication of the original (very old) 'rogue' in mechanics terms, but I'm hoping that the developer decides to pursue more elaborate mechanics so that it becomes more the equivalent of something like 'moria' or maybe even 'nethack'.

The randomly generated dungeons and difficulty will only take the game so far. At it's current price I think it's ok, but it may be worth waiting for it to go on sale if it looks like development will cease.			"

								So far it's great!  It's a pretty straightforward dungeon crawler, with a unique and fun graphic style.I have three points of critical feedback, fully understanding that this is in Early Access:1. My biggest issue is that you are currently unable to sell items to the shop(s).  I'm assuming selling will be added, but if you haven't thought of it ... please consider it.2. When buying arrows, I purchased an extra 10 that I did not have room for in my inventory.  The arrows appeared on the shop-keeper with the message ""Press E to Pick Up Arrows"" however, pressing ""E"" did not work, even after I emptied my inventory.  3. Not being able to leave the dungeon.  Not sure why I can't leave, I think it would be nice to be able to go top-side and regroup a bit.  Just a suggestion.Other than that, lot's of fun! "

								Best First Person Rogue-Like Ever.The developer never stops improving the game, from the complete graphics overhaul, to the changes in character class and leveling, to the changes in dungeon levels and mobs.   There is so much depth to it.Something I said about it on a Reddit post about a year ago, in reference to the Android version which I am also happy to own.   The post was about Delver vs. Barony...  https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/322nst/delver_or_barony_maybe_something_else_entirely/ ""I've been playing Delver since before the graphics overhaul and I love it. I own the game on Steam and I also own it on Android. I purchased a portable keyboard for my tablet to go along with my OTG converter, USB hub, and mouse (using a Kinzu for the tablet - the Sensei stays at home) so that I can play it on the go. It's a very fun game. I personally love the new art style and it is a VAST improvement over what the game used to look like. Yes it's very cartoony but it's also not very demanding on your system and it has a good flow. The dev is constantly working on it and like any other good RL, it's a constantly improving and changing game.""I still don't own Barony and if I had time in my life, or rather, once I make the time, I plan on checking out Barony as well.  But Delver came first and it is a terrific game.I've played alot of offline hours as well as spent a good deal of time playing the Android version on my Shield Tablet, so don't let my displayed recorded time fool you.If you want an enjoyable, fun, not-too-hard-on-the-eyes (aka ""pretty"" or even beautiful (which aren't very important words to most hard-core rogue-like fans (but which are to me (and yes this is a digression within a digression within...))), deep FPRL (does that acronym even exist?

You can beat it in about 90 min, usually less. Most runs don't seem like they varry much either. Is it any wonder most people giving this game a positive review have like 2 hours or less in this game.

								Great game.  Minecraft style 3-D dynamically generated roguelike. There is a good selection of weapons, armor, and monsters, and every game is different.  Some interesting mechanics, and the gameplay is solid.  I like that this game doesn't try to do too much, it knows what it wants to do and it executes perfectly.  Graphics are functional and the art style fits the game well.  Looking forward to any further updates they make, but the game is already very playable and I haven't run into any crashes.  I haven't been able to figure out how to save a game, not sure if that functionality exists yet, if not that would be my one suggestion.			"

								A fun little rouguelike. Recent-ish update saw a nice graphics overhaul from something reminicient of minecraft to a more 16 bit aesthetic. The ability to keep gold earned from previous attempts keeps me coming back, but once you figure out how it's done you can run through the dungeon and make it out alive every time. Still, the game's in beta with more updates sure to come. Got my copy on sale, it's definitely worth the five bucks or so I spent on it. Note: PC version controls a lot better and is a lot more up to date than the android version, but that goes without saying.			"

I love the sound and music in this game, it's very captivating.Overall score: 12/20 (60%) I do not recommend this game to anyone looking to get into the rogue-like game, it a very stale example of what this type of game can be.

								See this discussion post:http://steamcommunity.com/app/249630/discussions/0/282992562606063832/Great game at first.  Smooth controls, nice pixelly first-person interface, roguelike item-distribution, simple level-up system, good map.  Even the melee fighting isn't bad once you get used to it.  You'll find tons of useless items, and occasional upgrades, problems are that you don't have much inventory space, and there's no way to sell items (that I saw). Also, in the shops, you can't see the details (like how much damage) on items you may want to consider buying.  The biggest problem, and dealbreaker, is that once you get a few hours in, something will come along and just instakill you, no matter how prepared you think you are.  It's not worth the time sink.  Perhaps by the time it's out of Early Access this will be addressed.			"

								This game has great potential to give the player hours of fun traversing winding tunnels through the depths of the endless dungeons to find treasure and glory.  Unfortunately the games graphics are so pixely that even with everything turned all the way up it is very hard for me to discern between the different objects and makes navigating through the different passages quite irritating.  There is a few different graphic packs you can download but the only one worth getting they make you pay for which has turned me off from this game completely.  To the game developer I say make the graphics better and give people a choice between pixely and smooth lines.  For some people who have vision problems like depth perception or color blindness the over pixilazation would cause too much interference to enjoyably play this game.			"

								This game has great potential. However, combat is unnecessarily difficult (no cursor, no knowledge of enemy hitbox). Most attacks that ""should"" hit end up missing, which very well may be a game mechanic. My first dungeon run also crashed, and I have experienced jarred graphics and framerate drops randomly throughout a few minutes of play. Full keybinds are tough to figure out without a controls page in the options. You end up dropping gear more often than equiping it.Granted, this is an early-access game, so I will be following it's future updates and improvements.			"

								Its really bad, dont waste your money. It has nothing to do with the game being in early access. The general design choices are horrible. In a good roguelike you can just start playing, clear the levels and have fun.  ""Randomized levels - never the same game twice"" should actually say: ""Randomized levels - almost never get past the first few levels, because we randomly swapped out your starting healing potion for an instant death potion, and we randomly replaced the low level monsters with monsters that have undodgeable ranged attacks that 1 hit kill you.""Besides the bad use of randomization the entire combat system is ""Hold down left mouse button, let go when neer enermy"".Enemy ranged attacks are completely undodgeable because arrows and magic attacks fly faster then bullets. Even worse If you hit, or the enemy hits you is done entirely behind behind the scenes with random rolls based on your stats.There are no choices in classes or races or any way to make your character special. You start with a dagger, a wand with 6 charges, and two completely random potions. You cant buy anything from the shops and you have to go right into the dungeon, and you cant come out until you clear it. You also cant sell anything and there are poison monsters on the first level that will drop your HP down to 1 if one of your two random potions was not an anti-poison potion.In short, the game is bad because whether you win or lose is entirely dependent on luck, and not player skill.

								Extremely easy and very short, beat the game in less than an hour and that was while streaming and not really paying full attention.The graphics and music are great but I don't see enough depth to warrant a replay let alone actually playing it the first time. If you've played Doom, you've played this and Doom is free + has more depth.If you absolutely must try it, wait for a big discount or hold off to see if they update it any more.			"

								God horrible. Sure, it has a great combat system, loads of items, and heck, even a great boss fight! However, this game consists of many flaws that ruin the gameplay.1. No Jump Buttons2. Bats that have the glitchiest movement patterns in any game.3. Crazy damage after picking up the Orb, I had full platemail and 60 health, but monsters were still dealing like 6-8 damage! Not the melee, I was fine with that, but the mages were just shooting spell after spell after spell, you couldn't even say ""I'm dead"" before you're dead.This is supposed to be a rogue game, but only problem. UNFAIR CHALLENGE, you want something fair? Go play Crypt of the Necrodancer, and avoid this abysmal failure for ""challenge"".P.S: This is Early Access, so it will have bugs, but this is way TOO many.			"

								Well done in comparison to most early access titles, Delver manages to keep a simplistic approach to gameplay yet keeps you coming back for more runs. The game allows little room for building your character as you progress, and you are left at the game's mercy when it comes to gear. As you progress deeper into the games dungeon, your play style will rely almost solely on what weapons and armor you find and your luck with the random level generator. Still, the game is a real-time roguelike experience, and much like classic roguelikes, you will often find yourself backpedaling into doorways while trying to kite varied and numerous enemies. It's easy to catch yourself reserving all of your ranged attacks (wands rely on finite charges and bows rely on a rare stock of arrows) for dire circumstances, while searching constantly for a better melee weapon. Armor can be hit or miss, and is often a trade-off between movement speed and protection (both of which are very effective).From death to death, your gold will carry over. The only opportunity to buy items and spells is at the beginning of each run. While the dungeon is currently very short (only seven floors), the environments are nicely varied and the randomly generated rooms keeps it feeling fresh with each attempt. It's worth the price.			"

								Many will disagree, but still posting this.Don't get me wrong, I like this game. I really do, just not recommending it at its current ""Early Access"" state. Especially because, as I state a bit later, the developer has not updated it much and the game is kind of unfair with the ""randomly generated maps"" being buggy, I got ~5 times when there was a platform blocking my journey to hell, kind of ruined it.Game unfinished, gets boring after a few runs. The game has a decent pixely look, but in 2 years, the developer has not progressed much. And for 8$?! If it was cheaper, like, half of the price, this would've been a decent game, but.. I dunno.

								Short light non nasty Roguelike with some cool mood of Ultima Underworld. It is still in early access but it is already very playable and in fact very fun to play and replay and replay. :-) Don't excpt a very deep gameplay but also don't let your first feeling and first 2/3 attempts misguide you, it's not a superficial game and it has already mutliple gameplay elements quite tuned. I just post this short short review for the thumb up, but for sure I will make a new review a bit more deep for the release version.			"

Early Access Review
								Delver feels like a well-polished beta for a game that is nearing completion, which feels really good in a Steam full of early access games left unfinished. I highly recommend playing it if you enjoy fantasy-themed dungeon crawlers or rogue-likes.It runs smoothly with very few glitchs/bugs, and has a great art style and enemy design with excellent semi-randomized levels. The music is spectacular, being in a ""simplistic retro"" style. The only issues I experienced were with some of the newer levels creating inescapable sub-sections (because of ladders not generating). Player level progression could use an overhaul, since some stats and playstyles don't feel powerful enough, but nothing feels blatantly overpowered, so that can get fixed easily. The game feels complete until halfway through, and without spoilers after that there are several levels which ATM feel like ""kill screens"" in that they are so small, with the enemy spawn rate being so high, and being in claustrophobic environments.Once you beat the game (or die) your equipped items, inventory, and character levels dissapear, with only your gold being preserved. So a ""level+"" mode would be a nice touch for beating the game. Also ATM you can buy items from shops, but not sell.It also has a simple but effective level editor, if you're into that.			"

								-Got to the last area in like 25 mins and killed myself with a glitchy arrow shot. -Poison is more powerfull than anything in the game and is used on the the weakest enemies. -Enemies hardly change lvl to lvl and items and wepons are very lacking in variation making the combat pretty boring. -Art stlye is weird. It wont stick to one style. Sometimes going for the Doom esk Paper Mario style and other times just pooping out huge blue crystals in old polygon style textures.-Gold carrying over playthroughs is the only real reason to play this over again which gives very lackluster items. (C'mon! If your billing the game as a rougelike it needs to have replay value.)-Looks like there is more content in the moding community then it the acctual game...-Game is pretty expesive for the ammount of content. I got it for 2.50 and I still think thats asking to much and at 8 bucks thats just crazy.  -In the short time I played Ive pretty much done and seen everything. Its a shame realy. I had high hopes for this game. In its current state I cant reccoment it in the slightest. This game has been out almost a year now and its still extreamly low on content. Think twice about picking this one up.			"

								This game is so bad, it isn't even funny. It isn't a roguelike which they try to market it as (disgusting and misleading marketing there). It's more of a first person RPG game, but one where you don't select class, one where you don't feel unique at all. The maps aren't random enough, they feel the same, enemies are way 2-dimensional. When it comes to enemies, the graphics of wolfenstein 3d are way better than paper thin enemies in this game. Some mechanics remind me of Amulets & Armor, which I much rather recommend to try out than this game. For roguelikes there's angband and the like. I'm not too optimistic that this game will make radical change, but if it does I would be happier than with the kind of direction it is going now.			"

								Delver has all the potential of being a strong FPS roguelike but it needs to fix a couple of key things:1) Games are currently too short. A full game takes about 20 minutes. I'd like to see a full game take about an hour.2) Small variety in weapons/armor/potions/magic. A lot of potential here. Just needs a bit more variety to add variations to the gameplay3) Most importantly: Game is too easy. I was able to beat it on the second playthrough. I recommend increasing the size of the levels, removing the minimap, increase the damage from traps significantly, more ranged mobs, increase the damage enemies do. Add mini-bosses and decrease the amount of healing items.Tons of potential. Recommend buying it to support the developer. However, be warned the game still needs some work.Positives:1) Bug-Free2) Good immersion/music3) Unlimited Potential "

								This game is really awesome in my opinion as it has a variety of dungeons, weapons, items,, enemies, effects, floors, etc. It is a very good game considering that it is in beta state. This game is fun to play, as you kinda like get into the character, Delver, as you explore all seven floors. This game is gonna get a whole lot better, as the creator, Chad Cuddigan is planning to release multiplayer, overworld, more dungeons, and moar stuff! I highly recommend you to buy it now while it's cheap, as it is obvious that it will cost more.Overall rating: 6.5/10 (as it is unfinished and has little amount of content)			"

								I always loved the simplicity of the dungeon crawling. Even though I am a hardcore RPG fan, a good old rogue-like with no backstory of my playable character is a bit...liberating, at times. The style of this game pays homage to the old school 3D Progenitor games from way back when (in a time when Mario 64 was only a dream). It is a good bit of fun, even if you only play through a dungeon once.			"

								Only played for 30 minutes so far but it's as fun and as addictive as I thought it would be. Not a big fan of perma death and then having to re-do everything but hoping on full release there can be an option to play without that or some way in the game later to retain stuff. I have a feeling the games not meant to be played without perma death though. I see you keep your gold upon dying, so each time it would get easier to fight as you could just buy some better items at the start but that would make it more repetative and for someone who is a big RPG fan I hate the thought of losing all my progress and having to do it again - that been said. It's a game I would recommend at the cheap price. Due to the Steam sale and credit I had, I only paid 5p so I can't complain lolReally hope there is a version in future without the perma death or a way to stop it via a mod or something.			"

								This is a fantastic rendition of a traditional Roguelike! The art style is beautiful, the combat is fun, and the Roguelike elements are pure and well implemented. At the time of this writing, Delver is an Early Access title. I do hope that the developer expands upon the existing game, although the current build is a fairly solid Roguelike. I think it would be nice for there to be more variety in the environments and enemies as you decend through each level of the dungeon.As a lifelong fan of Roguelikes, I can safely say that Delver is a great example of the genre. I have been following the development of this game since it was first announced and before it made its way to Steam. I am quite happy with how it has eveolved over time. I look forward to seeing what future updates bring to this game.			"

								It's good. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm gonna give some pros and cons.Pros:Even though the graphics are pixelated, they're still really good. It has its own charm.The music is fitting and catchy.The atmosphere is excellent.The weapons are unique.The game is a good price.Randomly generated dungeons are built well.Cons:Hitboxes on enemies are VERY strange. You have to be very close to attack them, even with a longsword. They always seem to have an advantage when it comes to melee. That's my main complaint.When you get to the level-up screen, I can't pick anything or close the window. The only way past it is to quit the game and reload your save.From the reviews I've read, the game is short. In conclusion, Delver is a good game. It'll definetely keep me coming back. I'd reccomend this game to people who like dungeon crawlers or the Elder Scrolls series.			"

								Delver is a surprisingly catchy dungeon-crawler, rogue-like, mixing with a little of old-school RPG. Its controls feel much like old shooters, like Duke Nukem 3D or the original Wolfenstein. With very tight controls, a decent soundtrack and a very dungeon-like feeling (is this what it's called?) it let's you fight your way through various different dungeons, like, well, a dungeon, a cave, the sewers etc. while the proceedually generated world, in combination with many different mobs, keeps you entertained.

								the emotion of this game is not going down to get the orb but finally exiting the dungeon. you may get inside times and times again and at some point you get frustrated to never reach to that treasure under the dungeon, until I finally get to know to disarm traps I died a lot of times, but when you reach the boss and rush your way to the orb, completely ignoring the lich, then you can feel your heart accelerate. the randomness of this game increases it's lifetime, however, getting the orb is the only thing you can do there, and it eventually makes the game boring after you try it so many times.

								Tremendously fun so far! I love the graphical style and the music. It's a simple game that has great potential and I hope that it will be continued to be expanded by its author. As it is, it's relatively short. I finished it on my third try. The first time I didn't know what I was doing and died quickly. The second time I was more careful and made it to the end, but didn't realize I was near the end, and so I died again. The third time I was prepared, and beat the game. The gold / buying stuff is handled in an interesting way; the gold you collect can only be used to buy things in the NEXT game you play. So while you don't keep levels, items, etc after you die, you do gain an advantage the next time. There are a few annoying things, which will hopefully get fixed in later versions. Some are glitches, like enemies getting stuck in walls. Others are interface things; I found switching between weapons in the middle of combat didn't always work as well as I'd like. However I'd say that Delver is worth buying ... I probably won't play it again until it's next update, but I'm looking forward to doing so.			"

There's no reason to have shop keepers at camp because you buy anything in the beginning nor can you really sell anything. Again, it's a nice dungeon crawler, but way to short and isn't really worth $7.99. I definitely recommend this if they lower the price or fix some of the problems I pointed out. "

								 For the 2 hours I've already put into it, I've got a really good feeling about it. For one, it perfectly re-captured my nearly 15 year old nostalgia for that cross marketing classic: Chex Quest.... you look confused.You see, it wasn't simply a bald faced endorsement for low sugar breakfast cereals and the General Mills corporation, it was also just a damn good Doom clone. There's something about CQ that I'll never let go of, and it's something no other game has reminded me of since. Except Delver for some reason. The 2-D characters in a 3-D environment is big part of it, but the way the combat works and the way the camera moves just feels so... so cozy.But if there's no fond memories for you there, the looting, leveling, and hack'n'slashing, will do you just fine for $8. There feels like hours of content in here and the 6 run throughs I've done have felt completely different from each other. It certainly feels like a finished product to me. "

								I Used to jack hours into this game when it was f2p. I can fully understand why they made it pay to play because it has come such a far way. I bought it on Steam when it became greenlighted and bought it on Andriod as well. Perma-Death and character progression really captures you, not to mention the level editor which allows you to empty your creativity into your own Delver experience. There is loads of loot that can give you a lot of satisfaction. Cartoony and Retro-like graphics gives this game much more uniqueness than others. Tons of monsters and enemies to fight and die by. Great music and sounds, that are very well blended within the entire gameplay itself. I give this a nice 4/5.Pros:Immense Character ProgressionVery Unique Level EditorGood Overall Combat SystemAddictive Loot GatheringPerma Death Can Suck You Into the Game (Perma Death Good and Bad)Cons:Can Get Repetetive at TimesPerma Death can be quite Frustrating (Perma Death Good and Bad) "

I look forward to further updates/content and a bit more diversity to the dungeon generation. Otherwise I would love to see some randomly generated quests (maybe from notes, scrolls, books or non-hostile npc's) and maybe some form of skill tree to effect play style and weapons, besides range/speed weapon choice is a bit inconsequential.Keep up the great work.

I like the simplicity of this game.Weapon animation was a bit too much... now they just seem flying around without anything holding them. I'd rather keep it simple, than having extravagant animation but with that kind of flaw (no hands on the weapons) being obvious.I also wish that developers don't go crazy about doing 8 bit graphics too much tho. This one's okay, however, I would like to see graphics near like Daggerfall for this kind of theme. Sure it's pretty to look at and seems clean and charming enough, but 8 bit doesn't always mean overly blocky.Nevertheless, this one's a keeper. Ill be playing Delver in years to come.

It was wicked fun then, and it's just gotten better. Like Eldritch? You'll like this. Like Minecraft? Ditto. If you ever played a roguelike, and wanted it to move just a little bit faster, this is for you. The beta kind of lends itself to a charm, though the frequent updates mean that occasionally your save files will be completely lost. If you're not a fan of that, wait til it's done. But if you want an original dungeoncrawler with a dearth of story and a ton of heart? This is for you.			"

								Delver is a casual game, with challenging and never stale gameplay. Your Mission whether or not you choose to accept it is to venture deep into a ancient ruin and find a mystical orb, along the way you'll zombies, bandits, wizards, spiders, worms, demons, and god knows what else. I reccomend Delver for all those that like RPGs, old style games, the adventure aspect, or simply the satisfaction of brutally murdering your foes...			"

								This game is pretty fun, i must say. Fight through 7 levels of a dungeon, kill the big bad lich, take the big bad orb, and fight your way back out. melee, magic, arrows. if you die, you keep the gold so don't feel bad about losing all of your items on death.  The dungeon is new after every death. Minecraft-esque (just below DOOM-esque) graphics, but there are mod packs if you don't like it.			"

								Tremendously fun so far! I love the graphical style and the music. It's a simple game that has great potential and I hope that it will be continued to be expanded by its author. As it is, it's relatively short. I finished it on my third try. The first time I didn't know what I was doing and died quickly. The second time I was more careful and made it to the end, but didn't realize I was near the end, and so I died again. The third time I was prepared, and beat the game. The gold / buying stuff is handled in an interesting way; the gold you collect can only be used to buy things in the NEXT game you play. So while you don't keep levels, items, etc after you die, you do gain an advantage the next time. There are a few annoying things, which will hopefully get fixed in later versions. Some are glitches, like enemies getting stuck in walls. Others are interface things; I found switching between weapons in the middle of combat didn't always work as well as I'd like. However I'd say that Delver is worth buying ... I probably won't play it again until it's next update, but I'm looking forward to doing so.			"

								It's a nice dungeon crawler, but it's way to short, and you can't sell anything you get because you can't go back to camp until you reach the end of the dungeon, pick up an orb, and take it all the way back up. There's no reason to have shop keepers at camp because you buy anything in the beginning nor can you really sell anything. Again, it's a nice dungeon crawler, but way to short and isn't really worth $7.99. I definitely recommend this if they lower the price or fix some of the problems I pointed out. "

								Delver is definitely worth playing. Think, Legend of Grimrock meets Minecraft... You'll start off as an adventurer in a camp with a random set of gear to get you started. This camp holds shop keepers who can sell you items that will help you on your way, the catch is you probably can't afford anything they sell.Ok so, the deal is this... You start with basically nothing, a pair of ""useless pants"" and leather armor, an iron dagger, a random magic wand, and a random potion. This means no money, and very little to get you going. However as you play through Delver's brilliantly crafted, procedurally generated levels you'll find gear pretty quickly, and also gold. Once you enter the dungeon there is no leaving until you complete the dungeon, or die. I.E. no going back to to town to restock potions or buy new items. What use is there in having a town in the first place? Well, when you die you lose everything and start a new random dungeon, --but you keep your gold--. So should you die, perhaps you can now afford to buy an amulet with extra armor, or a better weapon to start with. Maybe a scroll of healing, or if you have enough money you can purchase a ""skill in a jar"" basically a level up. So camp can be pretty helpful if your just having a rough time finding things to get you through. Just keep in mind when you die again these items are lost.So far Delver has only seven floors. I'm hoping that the devs will add more in the future or perhaps make a sort of new game plus mode. In the meantime though, these seven floors are challenging. Hallways, blind corners, randomized traps, enemies from nowhere, and darkness work together to foil your attempts to make it to the next floor. When you finally do make it the floor seven and find the treasure you then have to fight your way back to the top floor with harder enemies spawning all around you. Fighting your way back to the top is almost panic inducing, as you will quickly find yourself scrounging for everly last item, potion and scrap of food, making the final door to the end of the game feel pretty damn satisfying, and fueling an urge to do it all over again.For the love of all that is good play Delver.I for one am looking ever forward to more and more updates to what promises to be a great old school dungeon crawler.

								 For the 2 hours I've already put into it, I've got a really good feeling about it. For one, it perfectly re-captured my nearly 15 year old nostalgia for that cross marketing classic: Chex Quest.... you look confused.You see, it wasn't simply a bald faced endorsement for low sugar breakfast cereals and the General Mills corporation, it was also just a damn good Doom clone. There's something about CQ that I'll never let go of, and it's something no other game has reminded me of since. Except Delver for some reason. The 2-D characters in a 3-D environment is big part of it, but the way the combat works and the way the camera moves just feels so... so cozy.But if there's no fond memories for you there, the looting, leveling, and hack'n'slashing, will do you just fine for $8. There feels like hours of content in here and the 6 run throughs I've done have felt completely different from each other. It certainly feels like a finished product to me. "

								I Used to jack hours into this game when it was f2p. I can fully understand why they made it pay to play because it has come such a far way. I bought it on Steam when it became greenlighted and bought it on Andriod as well. Perma-Death and character progression really captures you, not to mention the level editor which allows you to empty your creativity into your own Delver experience. There is loads of loot that can give you a lot of satisfaction. Cartoony and Retro-like graphics gives this game much more uniqueness than others. Tons of monsters and enemies to fight and die by. Great music and sounds, that are very well blended within the entire gameplay itself. I give this a nice 4/5.Pros:Immense Character ProgressionVery Unique Level EditorGood Overall Combat SystemAddictive Loot GatheringPerma Death Can Suck You Into the Game (Perma Death Good and Bad)Cons:Can Get Repetetive at TimesPerma Death can be quite Frustrating (Perma Death Good and Bad) "

								Really enjoying this so far charming style and great fun reminds me of Ultima Underworld gone cuddly; however, I can see this becoming repetitive as it lacks that games depth but the same applies to most loot crawlers including the big boys like Diablo and Borderlands. I look forward to further updates/content and a bit more diversity to the dungeon generation. Otherwise I would love to see some randomly generated quests (maybe from notes, scrolls, books or non-hostile npc's) and maybe some form of skill tree to effect play style and weapons, besides range/speed weapon choice is a bit inconsequential.Keep up the great work.

When the game is updated enough and more has been added then knock yourself out.If you enjoy rogue like adventure games than this deffinitaly for you. If you like playing games that are new and origional then this is also for you. If you like both then please, buy the game and back the developers.

								Delver really brings me back to Daggerfall, it's a fun little randomly-generated dungeon crawler. Enviroments stay fresh, no two playthroughs are alike. Each dungeon level brings new elements and enemies, from easier mages and warriors at the beginning to tough undead enemies at the lower levels. Enemy AI is surprisingly smart for game like this, damage an enemy and it will retreat, prepare to swing and the enemy will move to dodge, etc. It's a nice contrast to a game like Minecraft where enemies are programmed to just walk into you until you die. At the ruins level, the difficulty curve spikes, so some tactical thinking is required. You can't just run and gun, and I found myself taking advantage of things like corners and different enemy positions. Delver is a roguelike, so it features perma-death. You can't make your decisions lightly, and that's a good thing.The game has only been out for a few months and it is still in beta so there is still room for improvement. You're essentially restricted to playing a battlemage; the drop rates for things like weapons, wands and scrolls are completely random so you'll need to use a mix of everything to succeed. I think an item that allows the player to recharge an empty wand would help with that. I wish there was a bit more variation in the enemies, it's currently limited to about four or five types per-dungeon-type and some of them (like bats) can start to become annoying after a while. Potions very useful but their stats are generated randomly with every new playthrough, so you need to determine their stats through trial-and-error. If you don't have the food or health/restore potions to afford you the ability to test new potions out, you ignore them, and they start to build up in your inventory. I love the randomly-generated aspect of this game but if they were color-coded (red for health, blue for magic, etc.) and still used randomly generated stats it would make using potions more convenient.Those are just minor things though, Delver is still a great indie title with a lot of potential and I'd highly reccomend it, especially if you're a fan of the early Elder Scrolls titles.

								I've enjoyed this game, but it's a tenative recommendation I give with the following advice: try rougelike games first, see if you like them. This puppy's more a dog for fans of Ultima Underworld, for those familiar with the game, than someone looking for a first-person, cartoony Diablo. Which *was* the developer's goal and they need to be commended for their efforts: the game, for what it is, is in my opinion a good but (right now at least) somewhat limited game, and one that's still in development besides. See if you like any of the free rougelike games out there- if not Rouge itself. See if you like games with very little plot to speak of (Doom did have a plot; Super Mario Bros. 3 as well). Read up on Delver and games like it just a bit. And thenm when you're ready, take the plunge: $8 is really quite a deal for a charming little pick-me-up game like this (relatively easy deaths means this game is ""just one more try"" obsession-ready, so bear this in mind too). God speed.			"

It took me awhile to get to the end and you beat the game once you do. Whenever you die though, you lose everything, but you keep the money you earn. I havent played it since I won, but I will once its updated again. Its definitely worth $7.99 in my opinion. I mean come on, who doesn't like exploring dungeons in a game like this?			"

Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.			"

								This game is very, very nice for early acess/beta. You can think of this like a magical DOOM-like game but when you die, you need a new charcter and everything changes. EVERYTHING changes, including the potions (so red could be instant health or poison as an example) and the levels. The main goal of this game is to the bottom floor to get treasure and to back to the top. Some of the game's mechanics don't work, such as the gold (you can acess shops in the begining, but you die in the dungeon with the gold. Overall I give this game an 8.5/10.			"

								There is nothing that can describe a game such as ""Delver"". Its just plain out great and amazing, it made me laugh as I died from a mob of skeletons that just spawned. Why? Because I love the thrill in it, I'm not a guy who yells ""Don't die! Don't-FFFF---!"" I enjoy a game, and this game will make you relax in your chair and just hack away. Think of it as, a first-person Diablo but without all those crazy demons (Well maybe some you could relate too). This game had me playing and just enjoy what it is NOW...its not even done! It will change into probably bigger...faster...and harder from all the updates they could have! This game just has so much potential...and the creaters are going use all of it to make a game that will be remebered in my heart.

								It's good. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm gonna give some pros and cons.Pros:Even though the graphics are pixelated, they're still really good. It has its own charm.The music is fitting and catchy.The atmosphere is excellent.The weapons are unique.The game is a good price.Randomly generated dungeons are built well.Cons:Hitboxes on enemies are VERY strange. You have to be very close to attack them, even with a longsword. They always seem to have an advantage when it comes to melee. That's my main complaint.When you get to the level-up screen, I can't pick anything or close the window. The only way past it is to quit the game and reload your save.From the reviews I've read, the game is short. In conclusion, Delver is a good game. It'll definetely keep me coming back. I'd reccomend this game to people who like dungeon crawlers or the Elder Scrolls series.			"

								This game is amazing and is a must have.  It gives off a very nostaligic vibe thanks to it's 2.5D sprites and 2-3 frame animations.  New dungeons generate each time, with random items that get better the deeper you go.  You'll see a lot of repeated rooms, but that's alright because who really cares? Haha.The two things I can think of that most resemble a ""puzzle"" are the hidden doors and stuck doors, so if you're looking for a rogue dungeon with puzzles, you've come to the wrong place.I freaking love games where you collect better items as you go.  The variety in enemies is very nice as well.  The music is ambient and lovely.10/10 will probably be addicted to this game for a few weeks and then go back to Skyrim			"

								Great game, random dungeon, cute pixelated graphics, great control. I like the simplicity of this game.Weapon animation was a bit too much... now they just seem flying around without anything holding them. I'd rather keep it simple, than having extravagant animation but with that kind of flaw (no hands on the weapons) being obvious.I also wish that developers don't go crazy about doing 8 bit graphics too much tho. This one's okay, however, I would like to see graphics near like Daggerfall for this kind of theme. Sure it's pretty to look at and seems clean and charming enough, but 8 bit doesn't always mean overly blocky.Nevertheless, this one's a keeper. Ill be playing Delver in years to come. Great job, devs!			"

Short answer, it's great. Long answer?I actually used to play this way back when it had 8x8 graphics and had just added potions on my laptop and Android phone. It was wicked fun then, and it's just gotten better. Like Eldritch? You'll like this. Like Minecraft? Ditto. If you ever played a roguelike, and wanted it to move just a little bit faster, this is for you. The beta kind of lends itself to a charm, though the frequent updates mean that occasionally your save files will be completely lost. If you're not a fan of that, wait til it's done. But if you want an original dungeoncrawler with a dearth of story and a ton of heart? This is for you.			"

								A wonderful addition to the ever growing ""Rogue-Like"" population. Charming graphics, great music, and good atmosphere. I've only clocked in under 3 hours so far but I already see the insane amount of potential here. As of right now you start in the Overworld with a chance to browse a few shops and gear up provided you have any gold (Gold is persistent as of right now). After a bit of shopping it's time to head down to your inevitable death. You'll then be roaming floor after floor for the best loot and enemies to defeat. Combat consists of melee, ranged, and magic: everything an RPG player could ever want or need. Combat is fairly simple. Hit them and don't get hit. If you die well it's back to the beginning for you my friend. Delver also seems to be fully moddable and the dev encourages you to do so. If you fancy yourself a fan of Rogue-Likes and don't mind a challenge...I highly recommend this little gem. **Still in Early-Access** "

								Delver is a fairly competent hybrid of traditional roguelike elements and those of a first person shooter. As an early access game, it has the obvious limits that entails: bugs and incomplete content. In its current state, it is not a must have. Yet even in this incomplete state it has the foundations of a fantastic game. Will it meet the potential its fledgling form implies? I can't say. But if it comes even close, it will be a worthy addition to steam.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game so far. This isn't as much a review as it is my thoughts on what the developers should change, as this game is still in development and has frequent updates (which is awesome. frequent updates are awesome.)I love the art, although it's a little low res for me. Doom, the game this game's 2D-sprite-in-a-3D-world style is based off of, has higher resolution sprites and textures than this. I understand it's going the retro pixel art route, but it's honestly just kind of lazy to have characters this low resolution. Also, the blood is a little rediculous to me. Everything about this game screams ""E for Everyone"" then you go ahead and have these really stupid looking blood puddle decals that are left wherever you kill an enemy. I'm not saying this game isn't fit for kids, but it just looks odd and out of place. Either go a mature route and make the characters and art more realistic or take the blood out.The combat is kind of wonky. You hold down Left Click to charge up your attack, and the longer you hold it down the more damage it does. So you can either stab an enemy a bunch of times or give them a couple big, strong slashes. I understand what they're trying to go for, they're trying to make the combat more intuitive, but it doesn't work, mainly because you slow down when you charge your attack. So If you're trying to charge your attack you end up walking painfully slow towards your opponent, and I can understand it's for balancing purposes, but it honestly is just annoying and slows down combat.And probably the most annoying part about the game so far to me is hit detection. Since the characters are 2D sprites instead of 3D models, it can be really hard to tell if you're close enough to them to attack, and often times sword fights just turn into me slashing into the air not close enough to hit them, then moving closer to hit them and getting hit. It's especially annoying with enemies that don't actually attack you, they just touch you and you get hurt, because you're trying to get close enough to hit them but instead of hitting them you get too close and get hurt.I don't really like the music much, but I'm sure a lot of other people like it so I won't tell you to change it or anything, so I just turn the music off. But when you do that, you pretty much hear the torch noise on infinite repeat. It's understandable, because the game takes place in a dungeon lit by torches, but it's so, so incredibly annoying. Either turn the torch noise down, add different ambient noises, or make better music. Any one of those options would be awesome. Besides that, though, the sound effects are awesome.Although it has a couple minor problems, it's still a really fun game, and I recommend it. The magic in this game is really awesome, the feeling you get casting spells in this game is really unique, and the AI isn't bad. The level design is solid, but this game could definitely use some more rooms, I run into the same rooms fairly often. Bottom line is, it's a fun game that has potential to be a great rouge-like.

								As a person who seems to undeniably enjoy nearly every Rogue-like Game I pick, this one is no exception. It has quite beautiful throwback to classic Apogee/3D Realms FPS Shooters. While it's still in Beta at the time of writing this, it has great potential and a lot going for it if the Dev(s) continues to polish and expand on the content. I don't have any real gripes with it so far, aside from a bug I had when leveling, but seemed to be resolved by playing in Fullscreen. The artwork, in spite of being 8-bit Pixel Art with some 3D rendering, the graphics are beautiful, the controls seem well polished, and the combat is pretty smooth. Though combat is pretty monotonous, there's not much else you can realy expect from a Rogue-like, in which your objective is to NOT DIE. All in all, good game.

								 For the 2 hours I've already put into it, I've got a really good feeling about it. For one, it perfectly re-captured my nearly 15 year old nostalgia for that cross marketing classic: Chex Quest.... you look confused.You see, it wasn't simply a bald faced endorsement for low sugar breakfast cereals and the General Mills corporation, it was also just a damn good Doom clone. There's something about CQ that I'll never let go of, and it's something no other game has reminded me of since. Except Delver for some reason. The 2-D characters in a 3-D environment is big part of it, but the way the combat works and the way the camera moves just feels so... so cozy.But if there's no fond memories for you there, the looting, leveling, and hack'n'slashing, will do you just fine for $8. There feels like hours of content in here and the 6 run throughs I've done have felt completely different from each other. It certainly feels like a finished product to me. "

This puppy's more a dog for fans of Ultima Underworld, for those familiar with the game, than someone looking for a first-person, cartoony Diablo. Which *was* the developer's goal and they need to be commended for their efforts: the game, for what it is, is in my opinion a good but (right now at least) somewhat limited game, and one that's still in development besides. See if you like any of the free rougelike games out there- if not Rouge itself. See if you like games with very little plot to speak of (Doom did have a plot; Super Mario Bros. 3 as well). Read up on Delver and games like it just a bit. And thenm when you're ready, take the plunge: $8 is really quite a deal for a charming little pick-me-up game like this (relatively easy deaths means this game is ""just one more try"" obsession-ready, so bear this in mind too). God speed.			"

								It may be a bit difficult but the game is still in development. Its sort of like minecraft only you're going through dungeons and killing things to get to an orb(which takes you back where you started). Every dungeon is also randomly generated. It took me awhile to get to the end and you beat the game once you do. Whenever you die though, you lose everything, but you keep the money you earn. I havent played it since I won, but I will once its updated again. Its definitely worth $7.99 in my opinion. I mean come on, who doesn't like exploring dungeons in a game like this?			"

								This game is very, very nice for early acess/beta. You can think of this like a magical DOOM-like game but when you die, you need a new charcter and everything changes. EVERYTHING changes, including the potions (so red could be instant health or poison as an example) and the levels. The main goal of this game is to the bottom floor to get treasure and to back to the top. Some of the game's mechanics don't work, such as the gold (you can acess shops in the begining, but you die in the dungeon with the gold. Overall I give this game an 8.5/10.			"

								Delver is a dungeon crawler that is currently available in Early Access. Because of this, things I say about it may change as development continues.Delver is a very simple first-person dungeon crawler: you start above ground with the task of Delving down several levels to retrieve an orb and return it to the surface. This is the gist of the story, and all you really need.Along the way you'll collect loot, level up and customize your character, and fight hoards of orcs, spiders, bandits, and skeletons.The game is great fun and simple enough to be picked up by anyone. Although initially challenging, I found that the game is exceptionally forgiving if you pump a lot of points into HP. The leveling system provides some flexibility to create what character you want to play, although this really only boils down to what weapons you will use the most.The game is relatively short at this time, and I managed a successful run through very quickly. Even though character deaths mean starting over, I was able to finish the current game in about 4 hours. Levels are supposedly procedurally generated, but I noticed very similar set pieces several times on consecutive play throughs. Nevertheless, I still recommend the game. I'm very excited to see where the game's development takes it, and the inclusion of a level editor promises some interesting modding can be done.For the price of 8 dollars (I picked the game up on sale for 3), I do recommend the game wholeheartedly.

								This is one of the few games I bought early on during the early access phase and can say I'm glad I did. Each update has brought improvements and squashed bugs. The devs also haven't just decided to abandon the game or completely change what they were going for in the first place. They just keep improving it and that alone is enough for me to recommend this game. The random level generation is some of the best I've seen in the genre thus far. I enjoy the art style and music as well. Its easy to get into but hard to master it. I still haven't made a single escape after 25 hours logged. In short, if you like crawling random dungeons in first person and don't mind the art style, then this is definitely something to pick up. Even at full price I highly recommend it. Underrated game by far IMO.			"

								It is a 3d FPS, block game. It is quite difficult until you get used to how each mob works. Death comes easy and then you have to completely restart. Roguelike fun for some. The game is actually rather short. You make your way through the floors, and then back. That is it. Nothing more. In that sense its kinda depressing. You might replay it a couple times to just beat the game, but it quickly becomes very repetitve and boring. Its worth a dollar or two.Overall - 3/5			"

								A uniqiue perspective on dungeon exploration games, simulating that vintage video game feel with a touch that reminds players of other classic franchises (Zelda).

								We all know most early access games are total garbage, but this definitely has potential.  It's already a fun game, it just needs more content.  The game is casual fun, but if you're looking for a large game I wouldn't spend the money just yet.  That being said, it is only in the Beta stage so eventually, it should have more content, and thus be more worth your money.  If you're just looking for a short, fun game to not spend a lot of time playing each session, definitely check this game out!			"

Early Access Review
								Great game so far. This isn't as much a review as it is my thoughts on what the developers should change, as this game is still in development and has frequent updates (which is awesome. frequent updates are awesome.)I love the art, although it's a little low res for me. Doom, the game this game's 2D-sprite-in-a-3D-world style is based off of, has higher resolution sprites and textures than this. I understand it's going the retro pixel art route, but it's honestly just kind of lazy to have characters this low resolution. Also, the blood is a little rediculous to me. Everything about this game screams ""E for Everyone"" then you go ahead and have these really stupid looking blood puddle decals that are left wherever you kill an enemy. I'm not saying this game isn't fit for kids, but it just looks odd and out of place. Either go a mature route and make the characters and art more realistic or take the blood out.The combat is kind of wonky. You hold down Left Click to charge up your attack, and the longer you hold it down the more damage it does. So you can either stab an enemy a bunch of times or give them a couple big, strong slashes. I understand what they're trying to go for, they're trying to make the combat more intuitive, but it doesn't work, mainly because you slow down when you charge your attack. So If you're trying to charge your attack you end up walking painfully slow towards your opponent, and I can understand it's for balancing purposes, but it honestly is just annoying and slows down combat.And probably the most annoying part about the game so far to me is hit detection. Since the characters are 2D sprites instead of 3D models, it can be really hard to tell if you're close enough to them to attack, and often times sword fights just turn into me slashing into the air not close enough to hit them, then moving closer to hit them and getting hit. It's especially annoying with enemies that don't actually attack you, they just touch you and you get hurt, because you're trying to get close enough to hit them but instead of hitting them you get too close and get hurt.I don't really like the music much, but I'm sure a lot of other people like it so I won't tell you to change it or anything, so I just turn the music off. But when you do that, you pretty much hear the torch noise on infinite repeat. It's understandable, because the game takes place in a dungeon lit by torches, but it's so, so incredibly annoying. Either turn the torch noise down, add different ambient noises, or make better music. Any one of those options would be awesome. Besides that, though, the sound effects are awesome.Although it has a couple minor problems, it's still a really fun game, and I recommend it. The magic in this game is really awesome, the feeling you get casting spells in this game is really unique, and the AI isn't bad. The level design is solid, but this game could definitely use some more rooms, I run into the same rooms fairly often. Bottom line is, it's a fun game that has potential to be a great rouge-like.

								If you like gritty, 8-bit style retro dungeon crawlers, then you'll love this game.  The levels are surprisingly dynamic for the overall very simplistic style of the game, however, I found myself  trapped in the gameplay.  There are a few minor quirks that I think could be worked on to improve the controls, but overall, the game is casual, yet difficult enough that it keeps you working. So far, I would give this game around a 7.5/10.			"

								Delver is a first-person rogue-like. It plays a bit like a dungeon crawler/shooter, But you find randomly generated loot and goodies. If you don't stay on your toes, you can lose pretty easily. The 8 bit style looks pretty nice, but it just doesn't seem to fit the game play properly. I wish there were an option on these reviews to neither recommend it, nor un-recommend it. But as it stands. It's not too bad, and it'll definitely be a fun little crawl if that's what you're looking for. So I guess I can recommend it easily enough.			"

								I love this game, it's more than worth the cheap price and it is a great time waster. I've spent quite a bit more time on this game than Steam says, on both my Mac and PC and it runs perfectly on both. Which is saying a lot when most games can not run more than 20fps on low graphics settings on my Macbook Pro. You can hardly tell that this game is still in alpha as I have not come across any bugs or issues. The only issue I have with this game is the fact that when I die I lose all of my stuff and any of my upgrades and have to start from the beginning. I understand that this is a feature of the game, but I would really love it if the developers made a game mode for players like me who do not really enjoy perma-death games and would rather have a fun dungeon crawler where I can save my progress. I would still recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun little first person dungeon crawler.			"

								Very fun, short game. Takes you maybe an hour maximum to beat. The dungeon layout is well put together and expansive. Almost overwhelming at first. The enemies are pretty easy when you figure out how to beat them, and health drops and item placement is smart, despite being randomly generated. The music on the first two levels is swanky and smooth, and the overall atmosphere is dark where it needs to be and bright where it counts. However, I find that the overall outcome of your run is decided in the first two levels, because you need to start stock-piling health items and drop as many points into health as possible, and if you waste it, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.

								Delver is a good game to play if you want to kill an hour or two.Afterwards, it feels like there's no more reason to continue though. The weapons all behave very much the same. You have your slow close combat weapons, your long range, and your long range with flashy colors.I died more than 5 times from random things. Would be walking along, no enemies around and then die suddenly. Then be forced to completely restart which was very frustrating.I feel like this game could be really really fun though. Maybe hide special weapons around the map that you don't find via killing enemies, but instead in secret optional dungeon rooms that have increased traps and perils? Or maybe even have the ability to find totems or statues that can randomize your items, restart the floor, give you full health, bring you down to 1 health, or give you a very special armor. Somesuch like that. It may be a lot of work, too. But it could also be a very cool idea to make a hub town world with vendors and such as there are before you go into the dungeon. And in the hub area, you could get told of other dungeons to go explore as the same character.Still though, if you're looking to kill an hour or two, I say go for it and get this game. Updates are always bringing fixes and features.In it's current form, 6/10. Not perfect, but not too shabby.			"

								Delver is a fun, first person rogue-like dungeon crawler and it's pretty fun. Even though I beat it after 3 times, I still want to play again. I beat it fast, but it's still in early access, so many things can be changed. Now to the overall score;GAMEPLAY is really fun and satisfying. While I played I developed a tactic for each enemy, taking them out really fast. for example when a worm is about to jump-attack, I wait just the right moment to strike and take it down. 9/10VISUALS is actually pretty good despite the fact it is pixel graphics. However, graphics shouldn't decide if game is good or not, but it's still nice to look at. The inventory system is really easy use and understandable 8.5/10LEVELING. The leveling system cool. I like games when you level up your character and tweak your stats. Even though the most important stat in my opinion is HP, that's how I won the game. But you can only level up one stat by choosing 3 random stats everytime, so it's not always you can level up HP. 8.5/10DIFFICULTY. This game isn't really that hard, but it's not that easy either. For example, the magic wands is really good/ kinda op. I didn't need to level up magic at all, and they were still pretty good. It's in early access, so it can be changed. 8/10So all in all I give this game a 8.6/10. It's not perfect, but it can be improved! If you like rogue-likes buy it. If you like dungeon crawlers, buy it. It's even on sale when I write this review. BUY IT NOW! :D			"

								Challenge, frustration, beauty, fun, and awesome music all given out in perfect doses amazing game. sometimes when you get the orb and your on your way out its so intense and you die and it will irritate you and youll quit, but youll be back soon because its fun, addicting, and beautiful XD. good game to get your adrenaline going in my opinion it may even make you jump a couple of times XD.

								This is a really cool sort of fusion between a dungeon crawler and an old school FPS. The mechanics are simple but build nicely, and flow nicely throughout the pace of the game. You'll likely only really want to beat it once or maybe twice, but the fun of the game is figuring out exactly how you go through from start to finish. Neat stuff and good game.			"

								I wanted to love Delver, but there isn't enough to fully enjoy. The core mechanics of a ""game"" exist but it's not fleshed out or given enough attention to be memorable or worth the investment of a 30 minute or more run. The randomness is great at first but you see the same entities many times over with no payoff. There is purposeful stage overlap and retracing to gameplay which isn't a problem, but I wish it was more engaging than ""just run"". The game world is supposed to be alive around you but it feels frankly as if it never lived at all. If the developers add more content (better starting hub, etc) or find a way to make the current content better(more carry over from each run) maybe it'd be more enjoyable.			"

								Delver is a game about delving.You can delve into lots of places with many fine loots.Sometimes there is a skeletons.When you have the ball, you must leave, and many a skeleton.Gameplay is like exactly CoD but better. It has advanced inventory management system.You can use magic spells, like red, and green. Blue is really bad spell. Do not use.My favorite part of game is the story.(SPOILERS)At the end, it turns out that the skeleton was you family, and you kill it because you have amnesia.The delving represents sad and punishment for deed.All in all I giv e 20/2. Good game.			"

								This game is a lot of fun. My only gripe is that its fairly short. It doesn't quite have the difficulty curve of other rogue-likes so it was easy for me. It certainly has a place though, this is a great game for those looking to get into the genre. Its easy to pick up and hard to put down. Each level of the dungeons introduces something new with plenty of secrets to explore. I'm sure that the game will have plenty more to offer in its final form, but for now I'm going to have to put it back on the shelf and wait until the full release to replay it.			"

								This is hands down one of the best I've ever played.

If you want an older looking game with plenty of challenge this is the way to go. Controls are simple, goal is pretty straight forward, and the game looks great for the style of graphics used. Even though its in early access, this game is worth the money to buy now.			"

There is just something I can't quite put my finger on that makes it such a great indie title. One of the best Ive picked up this year. Looking forward to seeing what the devs come up with next.

								This really takes me (as a player of old dungeon crawlers on DOS) back to the early days of gaming.  It has a few key differences though, with the most important being how it controls much better.  This really reminds me of Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall, with the exception that this is a randomley generated game.  Wether you are new, or old to PC gaming, I highly recomend this game.			"

								A nifty little dungeon crawler with adorably chunky monsters that want to kill you in the face.  It sits comfortably halfway between Daggerfall and Doom.  Gameplay is still fairly rudamentary but it's shaped up significantly from the old alpha project.  Combat feels more fair and the itemization is rather generous if you take the time to check each nook.  The music gets a bit repetative, but it's still well done (particularly in the escape).  Hopefully more room blocks will be added to the dungeon layouts, however.  In my limited playtime so far, I encounted the same piece of sewer layout linked to itself four times in a row.  Some further stylization of the dungeon would be nice as well, to help differentiate it from all the other blocky games that have filled the market in recent years.  We'll see what future updates have in store for it, but as it is it's still well worth a look for fans of the genre.			"

Early Access Review
								    This is a fun adventure game that references the old school roguelikes with many aspects of it's gameplay.      One important feature of this game is permadeath: when you die, you have to start over from the beginning. While this may seem frustrating (and it sometimes is) the game manages to keep itself from becoming boring by having randomly generated dungeons each time you go through. Dungeons come in many flavours, from the big and sprawling, to the small and simple; some dungeons might have cavernous rooms complete with waterfalls, or libraries that seem inviting and warm until a mage appears down a hallway and ends your game for you.   The weapons system, while somewhat basic, has multiple weapons all with their pros and cons. Hammers and maces have a slow speed, but they can knock enemies back; swords are slower than daggers, but they have a better reach. Bows are good for getting rid of the annoying flying eyes, and their more powerful counterpart, wands are just more fun. When you find a weapon in a dungeon it can be made of a variety of materials, including gold - which makes for a very cool looking hammer. They also come in qualities and some weapons may only be good for setting of traps.   The game also has a very good sense of atmosphere, the music goes very well with the style of the game, and the graphics (engine wise) are very good. The lighting is very smooth and the engine allows for some nice effects. The art is very well done and fits with the style of the game very well. This all combines to make the game a very immersive experience and even with the best armour hearing an enemy shout from behind you is enough to make you flinch.    Howevey, as this game is in early access there are some issues with balance, such as mages being extremely powerful, especially on the first level, when you don't have a lot of health. Hopefully all the issues will be fixed in the future and many new features will be added.    Also, some people may point out the lack of a tutorial - while there is a very rudimentary one on a piece of paper in the spawn area, I think this game is pretty well off without a detailed tutorial. It is very rewarding to find out the best way to go about doing something on your own and finding a use for those items that seemed pretty useless in the spawn room...All in all, this is a very fun, albeit short game, but it has good potential for the future and it's replayability means you can enjoy it more than once. I recommend getting this (Especially for $8 US)			"

								I've enjoyed this game, but it's a tenative recommendation I give with the following advice: try rougelike games first, see if you like them. This puppy's more a dog for fans of Ultima Underworld, for those familiar with the game, than someone looking for a first-person, cartoony Diablo. Which *was* the developer's goal and they need to be commended for their efforts: the game, for what it is, is in my opinion a good but (right now at least) somewhat limited game, and one that's still in development besides. See if you like any of the free rougelike games out there- if not Rouge itself. See if you like games with very little plot to speak of (Doom did have a plot; Super Mario Bros. 3 as well). Read up on Delver and games like it just a bit. And thenm when you're ready, take the plunge: $8 is really quite a deal for a charming little pick-me-up game like this (relatively easy deaths means this game is ""just one more try"" obsession-ready, so bear this in mind too). God speed.			"

								This game is very, very nice for early acess/beta. You can think of this like a magical DOOM-like game but when you die, you need a new charcter and everything changes. EVERYTHING changes, including the potions (so red could be instant health or poison as an example) and the levels. The main goal of this game is to the bottom floor to get treasure and to back to the top. Some of the game's mechanics don't work, such as the gold (you can acess shops in the begining, but you die in the dungeon with the gold. Overall I give this game an 8.5/10.			"

								It may be a bit difficult but the game is still in development. Its sort of like minecraft only you're going through dungeons and killing things to get to an orb(which takes you back where you started). Every dungeon is also randomly generated. It took me awhile to get to the end and you beat the game once you do. Whenever you die though, you lose everything, but you keep the money you earn. I havent played it since I won, but I will once its updated again. Its definitely worth $7.99 in my opinion. I mean come on, who doesn't like exploring dungeons in a game like this?			"

								Amazing game! Even in Beta, it kicks♥♥♥♥♥as one of my favorite Dungeon Crawlers. In the short time I've owned it, I've had an amazing experience. Though the graphics aren't that good(I don't think they're meant to be modern high rez graphics) it still provides an amazing, exciting and emersive experience for the player. The graphics are actually quite nostalgic for me;the play style and art brings me back to games like Doom. The music adds so much to it, without it, the game wouldn't be as good. The new art design is awesome, and I love the fact that it is capable of having texture packs! I can see this game lasting for a long time in the community. With the random dungeon generating, it packs so much time for the player to fight, loot, and explore. I actually feel like some bad♥♥♥♥♥adventurer walking through the halls of monster/bandit/demon infested caves, and its brilliant! One of the best Dungeon Crawlers out there, and I can't wait to see what it's like when it's finished. Great Job!10/10 Would Play Again! Keep up the good work.			"

								Delver is hard, entertaining and beautiful. The areas are generated randomly, and each level you have to build up your character choosing between three random stats (exemple : you have to choose between health, speed and agility).This is exactly what I was expecting about the game. This is currently the 0.7, so it's likely the game will get deeper. Just take the game for the atmosphere (the game is really REALLY beautiful if you love the old school graphics), the gameplay (potions on the ground explode when you hit them, the traps can be activated with beer mugs, just so you know), and the difficulty (even first fights are easy, the game will kill you at any mistake you will do).

								Maybe I enjoy Delver too much. I run DirectX 11 games all the time, but I love new games that look old, run on low end hardware and feel freshly improved over archaic games. Controls are smooth, simple and the old school look is still colorful and pretty. Soundtrack is appropriate. I'm not crazy about permadeath, but it doesn't ruin the game really. This is Early Access so it's obviously not finished, but if I were able to travel an open world in this (like an Elder Scrolls game) along with some tweaks I would play this more than most of the 'next gen' games out there.

								Delver is a first-person rogue-like. It plays a bit like a dungeon crawler/shooter, But you find randomly generated loot and goodies. If you don't stay on your toes, you can lose pretty easily. The 8 bit style looks pretty nice, but it just doesn't seem to fit the game play properly. I wish there were an option on these reviews to neither recommend it, nor un-recommend it. But as it stands. It's not too bad, and it'll definitely be a fun little crawl if that's what you're looking for. So I guess I can recommend it easily enough.			"

								""Alright, got the Orb, one final stretch and I'm out of the caves. Is that a skeleton mage? Oh crap, I have to get across this pulley, please don't be a mag- Oh good, it's a warrior. I'll just activate the pulley and shoot at him with my wand. Steady, Aim, Fire!""At that point, my character, level 11 with 30/35 HP remaining falls over, dead from the spell he just shot. The spell was an Ice Blast, a blue slow moving ball that was capable of doing 13-30 damage. Unfortunately, the spell was slower than the pulley I was riding to cross a gaping chasm that the game generated with its unique random dungeon generator. Basically, I spit against the wind and it smacked me in the face.I had collected the orb guarded by a skeleton king and escaped the familiar halls that I had once traveled. Any enemies spared from my golden fire mace greeted me with open fangs and drawn swords alongside the army of skeletons so intent on retrieving what I had taken. I was so close, only for me to fall victim to own spell.At this point, many would be furious. Sure, it's a light rouge-RPG and death is to be expected, but the fact that a spell from your own wand killed you would be enough for most to say the game is horrible and broken. ""You shouldn't die from your own attack, that's common sense."" One would imagine.But in this case, it isn't. As I descended through the dungeon I would occasionally find these weird eye demons that would hurl themselves at me, shooting fireballs that would make quick work of any would-be adventurer without the proper gear and lack of decent footwork. Once in a while, these demons would be going so fast, their demise wouldn't be by my hand, it would be by their own as they would smashed into their conjured attack. I would laugh, grab any loot dropped and move on. I ignored the fact that an enemy could be hurt by their own spell. If an enemy could slay themselves, why would it be any different for me? Why should I be exempted from this rule?So I had to learn the hard way by adding my corpse to the body count of the dungeon. All that progress was now lost. The past hour, gone because of a mistake I should’ve recognized.9/10 "

								Very fun, short game. Takes you maybe an hour maximum to beat. The dungeon layout is well put together and expansive. Almost overwhelming at first. The enemies are pretty easy when you figure out how to beat them, and health drops and item placement is smart, despite being randomly generated. The music on the first two levels is swanky and smooth, and the overall atmosphere is dark where it needs to be and bright where it counts. However, I find that the overall outcome of your run is decided in the first two levels, because you need to start stock-piling health items and drop as many points into health as possible, and if you waste it, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.

Early Access Review
								I really like the game. I always love dungeon crawlers like this one, and the older pixel style of the game really appeals to a certain kind of player. Unfortunately, I've noticed a few issues with the game, given its early access status. The random generator for dungeon mapping doesn't always create a dungeon that can be completed. Sometimes you may enter a floor on which progress is impossible though an insurmountable object being generated between you and the next floor, and the game does not let you turn back to leave. This can happen on the first floor, or any floor afterward, no matter how far along in the game you are. A similarly game-breaking bug is the random generation of traps. Floor traps are, as far as I've seen, indestructible. One such trap teleports you. In my case, this one such trap teleported me to the room that the trap blocked the exit of, once again, I had to delete my file and restart.As soon as this game is finished and patched so that such severe bugs don't occur anymore, I have confidence in Delver becoming a truly great game.

								I agree with many of the reviews posted regarding this game.  Enjoy the retro-style play, random dungeons, loot and other stuff.  One frustrating thing for me is when you do end up dying, you start over again at ground zero.  Might be nice to have a way to save your ""progress"" at each level - not necessarily a full-blown save functionality, but nice to be able to not have to start over when you die....			"

								Pretty fun Rouge-like game! I adore the pixal graphics and random potion effects! Lets start off with the Pros!Pros:-Progressively gets difficult-Always different Potion effects-Traps!-Loot/Spells/Majik- Nice Graphics- Gold carries over death (Im not sure on this one but I think)- Always different Dungeons- Some weapons are faster then others!- Secret Passageways-GIANT AREAS!Now to the cons! Not that many because this is a great game!Cons:- Wizards are too OP for me- Wands have really low charges like 6 per use- Cant really chose what perk you want to upgrade you get 3 choices you can choose from everytime you level!- Poison effect seems a little TOO OP- Shop is a little pricey (But gold might carry over)Overall this game is fanastic! I recommand this game anyone who feels like going head first into a random dungeon! I also love reading the notes sometimes! Some of the secrets of the dungeons I still have not figured out! I will be looking into more hours on this then the current 4 hours!			"

								This game is a lot of fun. My only gripe is that its fairly short. It doesn't quite have the difficulty curve of other rogue-likes so it was easy for me. It certainly has a place though, this is a great game for those looking to get into the genre. Its easy to pick up and hard to put down. Each level of the dungeons introduces something new with plenty of secrets to explore. I'm sure that the game will have plenty more to offer in its final form, but for now I'm going to have to put it back on the shelf and wait until the full release to replay it.			"

								I bought this game after watching a vid and found it full of massive potential. In it's current state as a roguish minecraftian, doom wanna be it is great, but as everyone else is saying; it's short and there is not alot of content. Delver is the kinda game for an old schooler like me who luvs art. In it's presentation there is alot to award it for in the visuals department. The music is good too. Yet there is alot missing to making it shine and become a trully remarkable game. The addition of more levels25+  and larger ones at that. Increase the encounter enemy roster list(put some frign orcs or goblins and trolls in later levels) and include more secrets and activation items. Offer the plaeyers random merchants in the levels and saving or rescuing npc's. The attacks with melee weapons need to change....more speedy slashes, stabs, and bashes. Tooooooo sssslllloooowwww right now. Refill crystals randomly placed for recharging wands or refill gems that can be used to recharge.treasure chests or loot bags that contain treasure, traps, or monsters. (BAG OF BATS!!)dual wielding or shields for opposing hand.Slimes that crawl flat to the floorblade traps that swing out from walls or floorspike traps or pit traps that drop  players to doom or next floor. Doors that shock or attack(slam into players)...""vile doors"" indicated by two small cracks in upper part that act as the doors eyes.Crafting(nothing grand)just simple crafting that enables players to build pots, empowered weapons and equipmen. I do like the suttle changes that have occurred within th elast six month...such as breakable crates, caverns changes, monster sounds, addition of pillars, etc.Overall I will recommend this roguish game on the basic grounds of a low price tag, btu I recommend the devs putting more content in the bag so to speak like I suggested then they'll have a sleeper hit many a gamers can't deny has a great appeal and charm. Nice jpob devs, but please offer us more.			"

Early Access Review
Overview and Gameplay:Delver is a nifty roguelike rpg-light game with the basic idea of ""Go into random dungeon, get orb, get out."" Very simple premise but it works. Once inside the dungeon you cannot escape until you reach the end and grab the orb, followed by backtracking all the way to the beginning. Environment/UI:The look and feel of the game is very nice and detailed. Animations are fluid, lighting isn't too overpowering and neither are dark areas. I didn't feel the need to use a lantern/candle ever. Basically it's very Minecraft like but with a more SNES RPG style for sprites and you don't destroy/gather the environment. The dungeons are also littered with traps, lava and pits, so watch your step and remember to check behind you if backtracking too far.The UI is very simple: hold X amount of items and asign quick use ones to your ""belt"" for buttons 1-6. The game won't auto replace multiple of the same item, so don't rely on that if you're in a pinch. Everything is drag and drop, so you can throw away any unused items.Enemies:The enemy sprites have great attack/hit animations and it's very satisfying to splat goblins. Once you figure out how enemy attack animations go though, the difficulty is pretty much removed unless there's an area with a varying amount of enemy types, specifically magic users. Magic hits suck big time - magic animation speeds are very fast and will always hit if too close. Luckily they can be destroyed with your own magic or well-placed arrows.Stats:When you level you'll be given a choice to increase a single stat out of 3 options, however, there are 6-7 main stats in the game. I'm not sure how it selects which 3 to show you, as I've gotten the same option twice in a row and mixed, so it may be random. This can kind of be a pain if you really need more health but don't get the option for 2 levels. Available stats are attack, defense, magic, health, agility, and speed. They are self-explanitory except for magic and agility. Magic will increase the number of charges in wands, not the damage they do. Agility gives you faster movement when holding a charged attack. Items:The weapons and armor are pretty standard - leather, plate, sword, mace, bow, etc. The magic wands are nifty but the low amount of charges makes them more emergency items that are best used against other magic users. All food heals over time and is best used when you're retreating or right after a battle ends. Food is also good for combating poison as they basically cancel out. Weapon attacks can be made stronger by holding the attack longer, but each weapon has it's own timing animations. Getting that down makes strong attacks way easier to land.Potions are terrible. There are a couple different types but each time you load a new game the effects randomly change, so not all red potions will heal. This is a huge gripe as you have to try out each potion every time and essentially waste items so you know what to look for further into the dungeon. Another gripe is that potions do not stack like arrows (neither does food).Gold also drops from enemies, but in such low amounts that on my first successful playthrough I ended up with 774 and wasn't able to use any in the dungeon. The idea is that, when you finish the dungeon, you'll get to use the gold on a second playthrough so you can get some items on a brand new character, but this isn't as fleshed out as it could be. Items do not have any value and cannot be sold, so don't be like me and horde excellent items.Bottom Line:Delver was enjoyable once I got the hang of the items and felt comfortable using a weapon (mace). The visuals are great, animations solid, and the music was enjoyable and matched the asthetic of the game. I recommend the game, however, in it's current state there may not be enough replayability to keep me coming back. Some updates are needed to the UI/items, and if they expand on NPC sellers/items I think it would be even better.3 out of 5 stars/thumbs/pixels			"

								Based on your favor with the RNG gods (both in level design and item drops) this could be a quick 2-3 hour game or a month long grind.I love just about everything with this game. My only complaints would be that hit detection seems to not work at random (can combo most enemies but suddenly can't do so a few minutes later) and switching between items seems a bit sluggish.I nearly beat the game, but was taken out at floor 3 during the gauntlet.For the devs: There just needs to be a bit more for the end of the game (possibly more collection quests with additional ""escape the dungeon"" or similar objectives, preferably not all in the ""run the gauntlet"" style) and it's golden.

								I seem to be playing a lot of Roguelikes recently, and this game is pretty darn good for Early Access.Your mission is to explore the dungeon and find the orb at the bottommost floor, fighting through groups of people, bugs (ick), bats and skeletons. Get the orb and do your best to escape alive, because everything comes back at you threefold once you pick up the darn thing. The first-person perspective, coupled with a few small corridors and narrow walkways, really give you a mild sense of fear and excitement--you never know what's going to jump out from behind the wall (hopefully not a magic-user).The game is pretty short. For some players, you could run through the whole thing and escape alive in only about 3 attempts. But don't let that deter you, as it is a lot of fun regardless. That being said, I would strongly suggest picking this game up when it's on sale, as there is a lot to be desired. Still, it IS Early Access...Also, sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated. I went down there with around 80 arrows, never found a bow, found the orb instead, tried to escape, made it back up to the first floor and FINALLY found a single bow to use the arrows with. Great...			"

								Ive been enjoying this game a lot-  but it is pretty shallow. I see great potential in it! I dig the graphics and really feel this game has huge potential IF the developers  take the time to go the extra mile and give this game more depth.  As it stands now, I have no need to ever re-open this game.  The randomization gives some replay value but after you have seen all there is to see... why continue playing?  This game needs new rare-rooms monsters items I would also love to see something carry over from your previous life.  A mode to let you keep your stats after each death would be cool! Of course the game would get very easy over time as you get stacked up, but if it was never ending (Or super long) with much harder dungeons and monsters and more epic gear to collect it would be a great way to get you ready for those levels.As it stands now though- I paid 4 bucks- (On sale) and I feel satisfied with what I paid and played.  If this game was more detail rich with deaper levels of randomization and variety, Id pay 10-15 and play for hours and hours.  Ill shelf this game and check back when its done and hope that there is much more to see.			"

								It's good. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm gonna give some pros and cons.Pros:Even though the graphics are pixelated, they're still really good. It has its own charm.The music is fitting and catchy.The atmosphere is excellent.The weapons are unique.The game is a good price.Randomly generated dungeons are built well.Cons:Hitboxes on enemies are VERY strange. You have to be very close to attack them, even with a longsword. They always seem to have an advantage when it comes to melee. That's my main complaint.When you get to the level-up screen, I can't pick anything or close the window. The only way past it is to quit the game and reload your save.From the reviews I've read, the game is short. In conclusion, Delver is a good game. It'll definetely keep me coming back. I'd reccomend this game to people who like dungeon crawlers or the Elder Scrolls series.			"

								This game is amazing and is a must have.  It gives off a very nostaligic vibe thanks to it's 2.5D sprites and 2-3 frame animations.  New dungeons generate each time, with random items that get better the deeper you go.  You'll see a lot of repeated rooms, but that's alright because who really cares? Haha.The two things I can think of that most resemble a ""puzzle"" are the hidden doors and stuck doors, so if you're looking for a rogue dungeon with puzzles, you've come to the wrong place.I freaking love games where you collect better items as you go.  The variety in enemies is very nice as well.  The music is ambient and lovely.10/10 will probably be addicted to this game for a few weeks and then go back to Skyrim			"

								Do you remember old school fps dungeon crawlers? The ones that you have to run on dosbox now? Did you like Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall? Well then Delver is the game for you. It is pretty simple, the RPG mechanics don't go past simple stat upgrades, and equipment, which makes for thinking along the lines of: ""do I want to hit really hard, or run really fast, or never die"" the way to play. Combine that with rogue-like elements, and you have a very fun game. You can jump in for 10 minutes, and get a great experience. Replayability wise, the game might get dull once you've gotten the orb, however with all the different ways you can go about getting the orb, it will be worth your money. I'd highly reccomend this game to anyone that likes Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall, The Binding of Issac, or any old school fps rpg.			"

After you die you stop playing it and then a while later you play it again. Today I went to my friends house and I showed his brother the game and he got it right away and played it and got addicted and he wanted to play it twenty-four-seven. He was in love with a game as he clicked the first button. I reccomend this game. The best thing is that it's cheap.			"

Early Access Review
								Simple Review  here:Delver is a rogue-like dungeon crawler where the player's only goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon (7th floor), grab the Yithidian Orb, and return to the surface with it. What's the catch? Well I'm glad you asked. As previously stated, there are 7 floors in total. The first two are the Dungeons, the next two are the Caves, the next two are the Sewers, and the final stage is the dreaded Ruins. This game can have a somewhat steep learning curve, but it is very fun because each playthrough is an entirely new experience. Here's why. The dungeons are all procedurally generated (which means you get entirely new maps every time you play), the items one may acquire vary in quality and location, and all potions change in their function. The red potion may be healing or magic resistance the first time through, but it may be poison or physical damage resistance the next time through. These qualities are what make this game a Rogue-like. This is also a First Person game and there are NO PUZZLES for those of you who hate puzzles haha. Pros:+ The graphics are very well done, stylized in a 16-bit, pixelated vibe. + The music is very pleasing and enjoyable. It is fitting for floor's theme and atmospheric as well. + The controls are simple and easy to learn.+ The game makes leaps and bounds with every update provided.+ It has a surprisingly addictive learning curve.+ Difficulty is good enough to where you may finally beat the game one time, but when you go back to try again you can't make it. +Enemy AI is good. The various enemies have various attack patterns and styles, even methods of movement. + A somewhat complex weapon system in which there are several types of weapons such as the bow, wand, hammer (2-hands), and long sword just to name a few. Each weapon has its own knockback, damage, and range. + The leveling system is unique in this game in that you get to choose from 3 randomly chosen stats out of 6 total stats: Agility, Attack, Defense, Health, Magic, and Speed. + Can create various character builds according to the stats you want, the stats your given each level up, and the amount of armor you choose to wear. + Armor affects speed and defense: The more defense, the less speed in general. + Tons of replay value and plenty of good texture packs and mods to extend the game and make it more challenging. . . even adding new types of floors and enemies!+ Items do not carry over after death, but gold does.+ I greatly enjoy how you start at a base camp every time that contains two vendors who can sell you things after you collect enough gold in the dungeon. If you're lucky, you may come a cross a vendor in one of the first two floors as well. Cons:- There are still a few bugs to work out such as items randomly getting stuck in walls and making this atrocious sound that cuts out the music for the rest of your journey. - Another bug would be the bow sometimes passing right through enemies or just bouncing off. Some of the enemies may just have ridiculous hit boxes (looking at you floating eye). - Other than those two bugs, I never really came across anything that was bad or wrong. - Pick your poison here: Runs can take you anywhere from 30 minutes (if you're really good and have lots of experience) to 1 hour and 30 minutes or longer (if you're a noob). - For some players, the luck factor that comes in to play when discovering gear, the distance from the entrance of a floor to the exit of a floor, and the number of enemies that spawn, may not be entirely enjoyable as it will feel as if the odds are against you a bit too strongly at times. Overall, this game is a whole lot of fun and well worth every penny spent. The creator updates relatively often and they are usually massive updates when he does. He keeps everyone informed of his goals with the game and where it is headed. It's a very good challenge and you can quit and pick it back up at any time. I personally love playing it casually while listening to some of my favorite music. It's a very relaxing, but still energetic experience.			"

								Delver is a game that shows promise, but in its correct form I cannot recommend it. Delver simply lacks any compelling reason to be replayed. After completing the game in a little more than an hour, I felt as though I had explored nearly everything the game had to offer. Some of that time was padded as well. Upon reaching the bottom of the dungeon, the developers have you retrace your steps all the way back to the entrance without introducing any changes to rooms you've previously visited aside from sprinkling in more monsters. Delver has a great shell, but lacks content diversity.			"

								Delver is a fantasic Dungeon crawl for a cold night (or any night really) the environment is immersive, the enemies have gone through some nice AI changes to make them a tad smarter than a tea kettle, some even give a nice jump scare when you round a corner and a spider or Telepathic monster is lurking since they don't always make a sound. oh and Bats and caterpillars seem to drop hilariously large heavy items such as a mace or a complete set of mail armour. Love it, most of the other enemies drop coins or potions or minor weapons and armour. But these guys seem to carry a large mace around with them! lol The envronments are well crafted and quite large. The new maps make the trek more of a challenge as they tend to loop around and take you to cliffs and dead ends sometimes as they are not always straight forward to getting you around the maps.  Also  the maps are randomly generated with a pemadeath element so your never going to have the same playthrough twice as even if you get the same map the items and enemies have also changed and moved around.  The weapons are a standard mish-mash or the usual sort, dagger, sword, hammers, maces and axes, aswell as a few wands. Leveling up is random, your given a choice of 3 skills out of about 6 or so to level up so your not nessasarily able to just level one skill at a time. Ive played through multiple times and had a blast everytime, 10/10 for this one excited to see the changes as they happen "

								Delver is that one game you just can't beat. When you start playing you're not quite sure how anything works. Potions are random, how much health does this item give, how do I shot wand.After awhile you manage to save some gold up, learn the mechanics and build a idea of how you're going to build your character. Stats are random when you level up so every time you level you're always hoping for the perfect stat for what you want to do.Finally you've made it to the final boss! You defeat him mercilessly and take the Orb thinking ""YES! FINALLY! I've beat Delver!"" As you're told you must return to the surface to finalise your quest. Well, I wish you luck in retreiving that orb because ever floor you visit is a heart racing experience!			"

								Despite appearances, much of Delver's charm actually manages to stem from the voxel-based imagery. The combat isn't anything to write home about, but certainly keeps things entertaining as  you journey through randomly generated dungeon mazes. As a fan of rogue-likes, it's nice to see a first person one with a focus on melee combat, rather than the usual go-to standards of side-scrolling platformer or Quake-style shoot-em-up. Believe it or not, the music is pretty great, too.As long as the devs have the foresight to include a jump button and mouse-wheel scrolling in the finished product, this could be a lot of fun.			"

								It's simple which is fine for an early access game but I do expect more to be put into this game as some dungeons just end and there's no more going down into dungeon hell! I love that if you die the money in your pocket does not go away as if it was spirit money or something. On that note I hope to see a Sell Item Button on the shops or have a person that sells and buys. it's not to hard to get down the dungeons and if so is their going to be some number of dungeons where it stops and you get the ""secret object at the end of the maze"". If there is a story behind this all i would want to see places such as villages and not just dungeons which gets eh after being to over powered to kill with potions and heavy gear.			"

								Okay, so I originally downloaded this game back during it's open Alpha (Or beta, not entirely sure) stage in development when it was just a free 8-bit thing, and it was amazing. Sure the gameplay was simplistic, but that was to be expected. So a few years later I was kinda suprised that when I found this game was on Steam, as I handn't heard anything about it for a long time. So I bought it, and was amazed with what the game had become. The textures had been changed from 8 to 16 bits, and are really well designed. I'm also loving the tons of new enemies and weapons, as well as the possobility of shops in the overworld now. Admittedly the game is still pretty hard the further you go, so I have yet to have enough gold to test these shops, but it doesn't take anything away from the gameplay. On the note of difficulty, I'm also not sure of how many more dungeons they've added (There was only one in alpha, but that's definetly changed). There are a few issues here and there, (Throwing a fire wand into the water broke the sounds for me) but this game is still in early acess, so that's kinda to be expected. But compared to alot of the stuff that is on early acess, this is easily one of the best things I've seen in here to date.			"

								I have owned this game on mobile for ome time now, and I just recently bought the game on Steam. Let me say, this game does not disappoint. I got the game on sale, but the price of 7.99$ USD is totally reasonable. Here is why:-Great, Motivated Developers (Updates are Frequent, but not too frequent. I.E. Once a month-ish)-Loads of Combat (Lots of different weapons to try, ranging from Bows to Maces)-Lots of Hidden Lore (Notes are scattered about the Dungeon, hinting about the games Lore)-Lots of Monsters (Fight Mobs ranging from Spiders to One-Eyed Flying Things)-Appealing Graphics (Nice Retro feel, texture packs are avalible)-Wonderful Music (Very peaceful at times, makes you want to adventure)-Procedurly Generated Dungeons and Caves (Caves and Dungeons are Generated on spawn, every world is different)The frequent updates, music, and graphics of this game really get you in the mood for dungeon running, and it feals so rewarding to climb down the ladder to the next floor. Prepare to sink many hours trekking through dungeons, and when your character dies in an epic battle against a small bat, to instantly set off on another trip through a whole new dungeon.My only complaint is the fact that the scroll wheel doesn't allow you to navigate the hotbar.Also, saw a Doge painting. 10/10			"

								Short review: If you like dungeon exploring and the challenge of perma-death, in a game that manages to balance that challenge with enough play to keep you coming back, you shoudl check Delver out.Long review: The graphics are ""Minecraft-like"" for lack of a better way to put it. They're 3d 16 bit, nothing fancy, but they work. It definitely adds to the retro feel.The gameplay is the same first person dungeon exploration that harkens back to Ultima Underworld. It's balanced and challenging. There is a learning curve but you will find yourself delving deeper on each try and more importantly, wanting to try again after each death.This is one of the few perma-death games that get it right. It isn't frustrating but also is not easy.  Don't get me wrong, one moment of stupid can cause a restart but the build to your character is balanced with the difficulty in such a way as to make you avoid mistakes and almost always understand exactly why you died when/where you did. This balance is what makes me want to keep coming back and keeps me trying to delve deeper into the dungeon and hone my skills. I've tied a lot of these rogue-like games with perma-death recently and this one definitely stands out a a diamond in the rough.			"

								It's not entirely unlike Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, in the style and story (1. Reach bottom of dungeon; 2. Grab shiny orb of arbitrary unexplained power; 3. GTFO while being pursued by respawning enemies). However, Delver is a much shorter and more straightforward game, and is a real-time roguelike rather than a turn-based one. But despite, or perhaps because of, its short length (7 floors, easily completable in an hour or two) it is incredibly fun. It has the right amount of RNG; enough to keep things fresh with new layouts and items, but not so much that you can ever really get wrecked by random factors beyond your control. Every run feels winnable; every death feels like it could have been avoided if you had just played better. Plus it has a level editor now, and is still under active development, so there's lots of potential for more things in the future.			"

								Delver is truly a great game of the genre. Rouge-like, adventurous, funny. Always hearing the ""huh?"" of an enemy about 11 times before I actually see them adds the more unscripted aspect to it.  Wow does this game load fast The wide range of armor and weapons make exploring each dungeon a pleasure, not a hassle. Overall I'd rate it a 9.1/10, astonishing since it's only in Early Access. Yes, there are some bugs here and there, but hey. Look at Assassins Creed Unity?			"

Even though it is good it is extremely strong. I think that the damage of wands is much to strong and may need a slight nerf.I have played the game a lot and have only found one thing slighty wrong. This game is worth the buy it is great and has some old school touches.8.5/10 rating.			"

								Excellent first-person, rogue-like, not too pixelated-pixelated, dungeon explorer. I love the music and how some enemies seem to come out of  nowhere. This game is great if you like an fps/rpg/rogue-like, minimalist game and don't easily get nausiated from erratic user-mouse movement (because that's kinda my style). It's less pixelated than Home so it doesn't mess with my vision once I look away from my screen. Although when enemies get right in front of your face they get a little distorted but I'm sure that was intended by the developers and adds a nice flavor to the gameplay. Overall, super fun. One of the best early access games I've purchased regardless of the fact that I bought it on sale. There has been a little bit of clipping through walls (throwing items directly into a wall at about a 30 degree angle and hallways that loop around) but it's in parts that I can't tell if it was intentional or not so this is not a negative comment, more so a random add-on to my review.

Insta death is a thing, but when you reach your untimely demise the game allows you to keep all of the money that was collect to purchase loot from the vendors outside of the dungeon.Downsides: Pretty much no story, but it doesnt matter considering what the game is.I LOVE THIS GAME!!!

								Delver is hard, entertaining and beautiful. The areas are generated randomly, and each level you have to build up your character choosing between three random stats (exemple : you have to choose between health, speed and agility).This is exactly what I was expecting about the game. This is currently the 0.7, so it's likely the game will get deeper. Just take the game for the atmosphere (the game is really REALLY beautiful if you love the old school graphics), the gameplay (potions on the ground explode when you hit them, the traps can be activated with beer mugs, just so you know), and the difficulty (even first fights are easy, the game will kill you at any mistake you will do).

Early Access Review
								TLDR: An absolutely fantastic dungeon crawl that is casual and smooth, and feels more like a finished small team indie game than something in early access.Gameplay takes less than a minute or two to get into and is helped by the butter smooth controls and simple control scheme. Attacking, either with magic, a melee weapon or a bow (when you find one) is simple but satisfying with the casual nature of the game.Loot is plentiful and  takes after the genre of roguelikes because items must be used to figure out their effects. The simple hotbar system popular these days lets you see what your useful items are but provides challenge at later levels because potions and scrolls don't stack, leaving you with the choice to equip the scroll of resist magic you might need or the extra healing potion so you don't die.Easy to get into, and hard to pull yourself away from, Delver is a diamond in the rough and offers fun in spades for casual dungeon crusaders.

								It's a lot  like FTL: Short, but very addictive, insanely hard and very easy to die, but your failed runs can still help your next run, and when you think you finally made it to the end, there's a surprise finale you didn't prepare for. I really do like how the RNG traps and potions can be identified without you having to test them on yourself.  Also, poison will bring you to 1 health, but it won't kill you. Just thought you should know.			"

								This is a fun time sink right now.  Fought through the levels of the dungeon to get to the orb, picked it up and then all hell broke loose.  Almost made it up a floor but got knifed in the back by a skeleton.  The gold you collect can be used by your future play throughs much like Rogue Legacy.  No other persistence to your characters so far as I can tell.  Great fun though and I really recommend it.  Can't wait for the team to finish it!			"

								Its Early Access so I'm sure theres lots of things that can happen, but I'm not ready to say its something I'd reccommend. Its been in production for three years and seems like it has a lot to go to make it interesting for more than a couple runthroughs. Random Dungeon Crawling Rogue-Like Game. Its missing something big and its a combination of the mechanics and lack of really any substance that wont let me enjoy it as much as I feel I could. Pros: Completely random dungeon that works well. RPG Elements. Roguelike, so you never know what you're getting or if you have any chance to succeed. Money Carries over after you die.Cons: Unrefined interface, no story, visuals are hard on eyes trying to focus between like the 16 bit characters and semi 3D environment, been in development for a long time. No real drive to play through more than a few times.Overall, i'm not sure what can be added to make it more interesting. The Dev is looking for feedback, but the biggest thing would be to fix the cons. Not sure you you do that with the short playtimes. Why are you there, what are you doing, what is driving you, who are these people, what is the reward, what do I do with all this broken and useless stuff you accumulate, are some good questions to start answering.-Comiccomwww.thecomic-community.com "

There is just something I can't quite put my finger on that makes it such a great indie title. One of the best Ive picked up this year. Looking forward to seeing what the devs come up with next.

It has advanced inventory management system.You can use magic spells, like red, and green. Blue is really bad spell. Do not use.My favorite part of game is the story.(SPOILERS)At the end, it turns out that the skeleton was you family, and you kill it because you have amnesia.The delving represents sad and punishment for deed.All in all I giv e 20/2.

								This game is a lot of fun. My only gripe is that its fairly short. It doesn't quite have the difficulty curve of other rogue-likes so it was easy for me. It certainly has a place though, this is a great game for those looking to get into the genre. Its easy to pick up and hard to put down. Each level of the dungeons introduces something new with plenty of secrets to explore. I'm sure that the game will have plenty more to offer in its final form, but for now I'm going to have to put it back on the shelf and wait until the full release to replay it.			"

								I don't normally write serious reviews, usually I make a sarcastic comment that also tells you that I enjoyed the game....but this game....this damn game....it needs a serious review.To start, I've spent 5 hours on this game so far and I only have one question...why?Why haven't I spent more time on this? Well, the answer is that I just don't have the time, but if I did then I would play more of this game.This game is the sum of everything I love about dungeon crawler games like Binding of Isaac plus more, while Isaac is a fun game I just don't feel emersed in the game, this game sorts that.I started playing this game with the thought of ""Well, it's in early access, I'm not getting my hopes up for a good game"" but boy was I wrong. Before you ask, yes there are a few things that are a little annoying, for example the hit radius is a bit small but nothing that you can't deal with due to the vast number of weapon types ranging from swords to hammers, wands to bows.Overall, I highly reccommend this game if you enjoyed Binding of Isaac and even if you haven't played it, it's a great way to begin in the genre. 10/10STUPID BATS!!!!

								Delver is a fantastic game of procedural dungeon crawling, satisfiying real time combat, and exploration. Delver contains smooth RPG-like combat, where by charging your attack makes it more likely to hit your target (guarenteeing a hit when fully charged); a mysterious setting of an anchient tower holding one of the greatest treasures known; and oogles of replay value.Even though the game is currently in Early Access Beta, it feels well polished, and expertly crafted. Every update adds in more generation to every level in the game, and there are very few if any bugs to be found. The game has a very fair-unfair bipolar, in the early levels, the enemies are relatively easy to dispatch, but if they land a hit, it can take a sizable amount of health away; and towards the end, your going to run out of health a LOT.Delver is a relatively short game; you trek through 10 levels per playthrough of ever increasing difficulty, fight and defeat (as far as I am aware) a single boss, and make an excruciatingly hard, and harrowing journey back up to the surface from whence you came. The final level is the MOST unfair and difficult level in the game, and is probably the one and only constant level throughout your journey, as it appears unchanged through each playthrough. It introduces several enemy types not seen before on any level, and ALL of them hit really, really hard. I have never successfully managed to beat the final boss, and have only made it to him twice.All in all, it is very challenging, and you will die a LOT, but it never feels like you couldn't stop it from happening. Delver is an incredibly fun, semi-addicting, dungeon crawl with danger lurking around every corner, and an unfair boss level.			"

								It just keeps getting better.  The new areas are frickin creepy. The AI now shoots at you from accross the area which was totally unexpected.  The loot drops are more balanced.  The enemies get more difficult as you progress.  The levels are becoming less linear and less straightforward when looking for the exit. All in all, I have been in love with this game for 3ish years now before even the art changed. And still it fancinates me more so than any big budget triple A title.  I even found myself ducking my head to the side to try to avoid spell bursts flying at me!  Better luck next time delver! GG 1,000,000/10			"

								I really like the game. I always love dungeon crawlers like this one, and the older pixel style of the game really appeals to a certain kind of player. Unfortunately, I've noticed a few issues with the game, given its early access status. The random generator for dungeon mapping doesn't always create a dungeon that can be completed. Sometimes you may enter a floor on which progress is impossible though an insurmountable object being generated between you and the next floor, and the game does not let you turn back to leave. This can happen on the first floor, or any floor afterward, no matter how far along in the game you are. A similarly game-breaking bug is the random generation of traps. Floor traps are, as far as I've seen, indestructible. One such trap teleports you. In my case, this one such trap teleported me to the room that the trap blocked the exit of, once again, I had to delete my file and restart.As soon as this game is finished and patched so that such severe bugs don't occur anymore, I have confidence in Delver becoming a truly great game.

								Wow. This game is utterly magnificent.

You can be get them on long distance by using bow or wands, or just melee attack with swords, daggers etc.One thing I don't understand is leveling. Sometimes it just appears when I'm walking through a corridor.I don't know if levels are generated from existing elements made by authors or not. I died only once and I saw few rooms repeating in second life but nothing else. It's another plus for the game.Personaly, I would love to see more elements we could interact with such as ladders, secret entrance by bookshelf, perhaps some books to read? Here's the list.Pluses:- great atmosphere- simple and nice graphic style (and changeable textures)- hours of fun- ""classes"" like mage, warrior, archerMinuses: - except fighting there aren't many activities "

								This is easily one of the most immediately enjoyable games I've played.  It takes the familiar rogue-like formula and gives it an unusual first-person treatment and a surprising amount of depth from its seemingly simple system.  If you are a fan of hack-and-slash, stat-based RPGs, rouge-likes, or just a quick, accessible action game, Delver delivers.  My only gripes are with the difficult inventory menu.  It would be nice if the game paused while it was active and it's hard to get in and out of quickly.  I haven't found a way of identifying potions besides trial and error, and with limited health restoration, this can be deadly.  Random death is not good.Also, there are places where jumping feels needed, but there seems to be no jump feature.  It never breaks the game, but I notice the lack of it.			"

								This game is amazing! It reminds so much of Pixel Dungeon, except it's first person which makes it so cool! I love how simple the mechanics are, and especially how the food works. I also love the fact that you don't know what potions do until you drink them, and that traps do random things. I wouldn't say it's worth the $8 at the moment, but I am really glad that I bought it because it has so much potential to be even better.Some things I would recommend would be:- Option to sell items at the shops (hate to carry around 2nd best gear and have to leave it lying around)- Smaller minimap marker (the current arrow is way too big)- Mouse wheel to scroll through belt (using the numbers takes your hand off of WASD, which can get you killed since you can't move then)- Overworld map with multiple towns (then you can have a choice between what dungeons you want to go into, with each town having a dungeon that leans towards a different theme, like caves, bandits, etc.)- Jumping Maybe (the girl with the staff can jump, why can't I?)- COOP!!!! (this game would be awesome with a friend! although, I don't really know how you would pull that off...)These are just suggestions and I think the game could be even more amazing with them implemented (well, mostly the mouse scroll, minimap, and selling).

								A super fun Rogue-like dungeon crawler. Charming minecraft-ish style but with a flair all it's own. Great music and atmospheric feel. The mix of 3D environment with with Sprite characters creates a pleasing aesthetic.Thumbs up: Would Recommend.			"

								Fun, Fast paced and it really draws you in after playing. Took me a few deaths to understand how the timing of combat works and such. My only complaint about this game is the fact that sometimes you'll be exploring and you will get stuck between a low ceiling wall and the floor in some caves. 10/10 bagels!			"

								It's Minecraft meets Diablo in this rogue style game. Pixelated artwork is simultaneously adorable and dark. Randomized dungeons mean a new experience every time. The down side? You die, you start over at level 1. The plus side? You can keep your gold!Dark Souls lite 10/10.			"

								..YES! this cool little game is really fun and slightly addictive, you get so emmersed in the dungeons of this well designed game. even though this game does kind of look and feel like a adventure style minecraft at first.. you then realise how it is so much more than that with its clever notes of story and really fun gameplay! for this style of game i would happily give it 8/10 and i have just finished my first (and not my last) two hour session on it!! a library essential.

								This is easily one of the most immediately enjoyable games I've played.  It takes the familiar rogue-like formula and gives it an unusual first-person treatment and a surprising amount of depth from its seemingly simple system.  If you are a fan of hack-and-slash, stat-based RPGs, rouge-likes, or just a quick, accessible action game, Delver delivers.  My only gripes are with the difficult inventory menu.  It would be nice if the game paused while it was active and it's hard to get in and out of quickly.  I haven't found a way of identifying potions besides trial and error, and with limited health restoration, this can be deadly.  Random death is not good.Also, there are places where jumping feels needed, but there seems to be no jump feature.  It never breaks the game, but I notice the lack of it.			"

								""Alright, got the Orb, one final stretch and I'm out of the caves. Is that a skeleton mage? Oh crap, I have to get across this pulley, please don't be a mag- Oh good, it's a warrior. I'll just activate the pulley and shoot at him with my wand. Steady, Aim, Fire!""At that point, my character, level 11 with 30/35 HP remaining falls over, dead from the spell he just shot. The spell was an Ice Blast, a blue slow moving ball that was capable of doing 13-30 damage. Unfortunately, the spell was slower than the pulley I was riding to cross a gaping chasm that the game generated with its unique random dungeon generator. Basically, I spit against the wind and it smacked me in the face.I had collected the orb guarded by a skeleton king and escaped the familiar halls that I had once traveled. Any enemies spared from my golden fire mace greeted me with open fangs and drawn swords alongside the army of skeletons so intent on retrieving what I had taken. I was so close, only for me to fall victim to own spell.At this point, many would be furious. Sure, it's a light rouge-RPG and death is to be expected, but the fact that a spell from your own wand killed you would be enough for most to say the game is horrible and broken. ""You shouldn't die from your own attack, that's common sense."" One would imagine.But in this case, it isn't. As I descended through the dungeon I would occasionally find these weird eye demons that would hurl themselves at me, shooting fireballs that would make quick work of any would-be adventurer without the proper gear and lack of decent footwork. Once in a while, these demons would be going so fast, their demise wouldn't be by my hand, it would be by their own as they would smashed into their conjured attack. I would laugh, grab any loot dropped and move on. I ignored the fact that an enemy could be hurt by their own spell. If an enemy could slay themselves, why would it be any different for me? Why should I be exempted from this rule?So I had to learn the hard way by adding my corpse to the body count of the dungeon. All that progress was now lost. The past hour, gone because of a mistake I should’ve recognized.9/10 "

								If you are looking for a game you can play when you're bored, I think you will like this game. As I haven't played it a whole lot I think the game is worth it. As it is in beta, I can't really complain a lot on bugs and such, even though some of them can become very annoying at times. The games has a lot of potential, and if the dev continues  with the game, I think he is going to make something really cool.Pros:Nice musicA lot to exploreMap is randomized, you don't have to walk through the same thing over and over again if you dieNice texturesA lot of different textured mobs you meet along the wayAlways something new to explore--------------------------------------------Cons:There are basicly 2 types of weapons. Melee and projectiles. They all do the sameThe combat goes really slowly, and gets boring quickly2 types of enemies, with different textures. Makes fighting even more boringNo voice-acting (just text).No story to it, really.---------------------Annoying bugs I have found:Enemies tend to walk into walls, not attacking youArrows (that you shoot) randomly flies to the side, not hitting what you aimed at.I'd give this 5/10, but this is still in beta, and a lot can change! I only gave 2€ for this, and I think it was worth the money. "

								Delver is a 3D rogue-like game with randomly generating dungeons, and a randomly generated starting inventory each time you start a new game, making each playthrough fairly unique.Hopefully, future update will make the game a bit longer, as finishing it (without counting the failed tries) can easily be done in just a few minutes.However, I did have quite a lot of fun in this game, discovering new dungeons and loot every time I played.Also, this game has a texture pack by Sphax already, which gives me hopes for future mods or even more texture packs (hopefully though, these ones will be free...).Overall, this is a fun and good game if you don't wanna get involved for countless hours of playing. A new game of Delver is always fun to play, and with the high amount of updates, there are lots of new things to discover.Oh, and you can eat some steak you looted from a dead zombie. 10/10.			"

								Delver is a wonderful edition to the roguelike genre on steam. I've played alot of roguelikes before, such as The Binding of Isaac, Ziggurat and the like. I think Delver is one of the most basic roguelikes I've played, but not in a bad way. I love having to go down numerous levels, just to come back with an item; it makes it feel like a real journey. Now what would I rate the game, I'd give it a 7/10 as it is in development, just because there isn't enough items for my liking just yet, but I'm sure there will be more added in the future. If you'd like to buy the game, I got this game among other on the humble bundle website, for about $8 USD, it was worth all the money I paid. If you like dungeon crawlers and Roguelikes, Definitely pick this one up.			"

								Tremendously fun so far! I love the graphical style and the music. It's a simple game that has great potential and I hope that it will be continued to be expanded by its author. As it is, it's relatively short. I finished it on my third try. The first time I didn't know what I was doing and died quickly. The second time I was more careful and made it to the end, but didn't realize I was near the end, and so I died again. The third time I was prepared, and beat the game. The gold / buying stuff is handled in an interesting way; the gold you collect can only be used to buy things in the NEXT game you play. So while you don't keep levels, items, etc after you die, you do gain an advantage the next time. There are a few annoying things, which will hopefully get fixed in later versions. Some are glitches, like enemies getting stuck in walls. Others are interface things; I found switching between weapons in the middle of combat didn't always work as well as I'd like. However I'd say that Delver is worth buying ... I probably won't play it again until it's next update, but I'm looking forward to doing so.			"

								It's a nice dungeon crawler, but it's way to short, and you can't sell anything you get because you can't go back to camp until you reach the end of the dungeon, pick up an orb, and take it all the way back up. There's no reason to have shop keepers at camp because you buy anything in the beginning nor can you really sell anything. Again, it's a nice dungeon crawler, but way to short and isn't really worth $7.99. I definitely recommend this if they lower the price or fix some of the problems I pointed out. "

								A nifty little dungeon crawler with adorably chunky monsters that want to kill you in the face.  It sits comfortably halfway between Daggerfall and Doom.  Gameplay is still fairly rudamentary but it's shaped up significantly from the old alpha project.  Combat feels more fair and the itemization is rather generous if you take the time to check each nook.  The music gets a bit repetative, but it's still well done (particularly in the escape).  Hopefully more room blocks will be added to the dungeon layouts, however.  In my limited playtime so far, I encounted the same piece of sewer layout linked to itself four times in a row.  Some further stylization of the dungeon would be nice as well, to help differentiate it from all the other blocky games that have filled the market in recent years.  We'll see what future updates have in store for it, but as it is it's still well worth a look for fans of the genre.			"

								Everything about Delver just makes me love it more. It's got 3D combat, but nice crunchy pixel graphics. It's difficult, but not rage-inducing, controller-throwing, primal scream-inducing difficult. Both magic and melee attacks are viable options, quite the rarity in my experience.Great dungeon crawler, one of my favorites!			"

								A nifty little early access game that is sure to entertain those who love the classic rougelike genre.The pixel graphics are detailed and well made which give a certain old school aesthetic adding to the tone and athmosphere of the gameplay.Some people have been worried about the current state of development for the game. Let me assure you that while this project had gone into Limbo in the past, since the last couple of months the small developer team has made the effort to increase their transparency with the community and has begun doing weekly streams to show the current state of development. That does not however imply that this game may again fall into development hell.Therefore in it's current state I feel that this game is worth the money, however i advise those with less money to spend on games to wait for it to be fully released or pick it up during a sale.Lastly, I believe that while I find this game very enjoyable, people who are not fans of permadeath and rougelike mechanics may find the game offputting.

								Delver is a neat little rogue-like game that has a lot of potential.PROS:++ The 2d artstyle mixed with the first person perspective give it a fun look+ Environments are pretty and neat+ little notes along the way give bits of different stories to the history of the placeNeutral: Randomized stat progression as you level up No real tutorial/mechanics not explained  Still plenty of bugs (out of place textures, mobs floating into the ceiling but still able to hit you)CONS:- - Adds nothing new to the genre. Aside from the artstyle, it's the same as any other roguelike you can play- A lot of useless items- cannot sell items- HEAVY on the random side. about 80/20 luck/skill ratio to getting through the game.All in all it's a fun re-hash of rogue mechanics that is pretty and can keep you entertained for a bit. Has a lot of promise to be very fun, I just feel like it's missing something to make it really stand out.			"

This having been said, if you're just looking to explore a very pretty pixel art dungeon, there are few pixel art dungeons more suited to a pleasent stroll than what you'll encounter in this game.  It's very pretty.  Just don't expect anything interesting from the gameplay.			"

								--I have bought this game through the Humble Bundle store and thus my playtime here on Steam does not reflect my total playtime of the game.--This is a praiseworthy game. It's like playing a classic roguelike, the only difference being it's realtime and combat factors in your skill. Combat plays very similarly to Skyrim, and once you understand how to move and chain your attacks I think it's a very solid system.In terms of loot and magic, it's good. Once you get past the first three floors you will start finding more interesting pieces of equipment.Graphics are simple but they have a lot of work behind them. Art and lighting are very nice. Sound effects are good enough for the job.The music is better in some places than in others, but I'd say it's pretty good (especially the more atmospheric pieces down below).The game as it is is a great bargain. It's a 100% finished game as it stands. And it's good. And it's still being updated.			"

								I believe this game has a pretty solid base. Graphical style reminded me of Ultima Underworld, combat felt like Magicite combined with Minecraft, and that all got dropped into a simple stat roguelike game. Combat was pretty fair and can be pretty unforgiving if you aren't careful. That said, I believe this game needs some serious difficulty boosts via bosses and more dangerous traps. Cleared the whole game in roughly 110 minutes on the first try. Second thing I feel would make it more interesting would be the addition of more secret doors and maybe optional puzzles.			"

								It's not entirely unlike Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, in the style and story (1. Reach bottom of dungeon; 2. Grab shiny orb of arbitrary unexplained power; 3. GTFO while being pursued by respawning enemies). However, Delver is a much shorter and more straightforward game, and is a real-time roguelike rather than a turn-based one. But despite, or perhaps because of, its short length (7 floors, easily completable in an hour or two) it is incredibly fun. It has the right amount of RNG; enough to keep things fresh with new layouts and items, but not so much that you can ever really get wrecked by random factors beyond your control. Every run feels winnable; every death feels like it could have been avoided if you had just played better. Plus it has a level editor now, and is still under active development, so there's lots of potential for more things in the future.			"

								Excellent first-person, rogue-like, not too pixelated-pixelated, dungeon explorer. I love the music and how some enemies seem to come out of  nowhere. This game is great if you like an fps/rpg/rogue-like, minimalist game and don't easily get nausiated from erratic user-mouse movement (because that's kinda my style). It's less pixelated than Home so it doesn't mess with my vision once I look away from my screen. Although when enemies get right in front of your face they get a little distorted but I'm sure that was intended by the developers and adds a nice flavor to the gameplay. Overall, super fun. One of the best early access games I've purchased regardless of the fact that I bought it on sale. There has been a little bit of clipping through walls (throwing items directly into a wall at about a 30 degree angle and hallways that loop around) but it's in parts that I can't tell if it was intentional or not so this is not a negative comment, more so a random add-on to my review.

								Delver is that one game you just can't beat. When you start playing you're not quite sure how anything works. Potions are random, how much health does this item give, how do I shot wand.After awhile you manage to save some gold up, learn the mechanics and build a idea of how you're going to build your character. Stats are random when you level up so every time you level you're always hoping for the perfect stat for what you want to do.Finally you've made it to the final boss! You defeat him mercilessly and take the Orb thinking ""YES! FINALLY! I've beat Delver!"" As you're told you must return to the surface to finalise your quest. Well, I wish you luck in retreiving that orb because ever floor you visit is a heart racing experience!			"

								The game is exactly what it looks like, except for the end area. You descend 6 levels, have to pick up an orb, and re-climb them all to get out. When you pick up that orb, you have to deal with infinitely re-spawning enemies throughout the 6 levels, and all the care and patience you took in dealing with them before flies out the window. You leveled only health and made sure I had the best weapons, armor, and healing items you could have before taking the orb. It does not matter. You are swarmed with flying skulls that you cannot outrun and must fight. As you do so, Skeleton mages bombard you with magic from beyond the game's very tiny draw distance, and you die. In a game about resource managemeant and dungeon delving, rushing things leads to death, and the game forces you to do so.I do not recommend this game, and doubt it will be fixed.			"

								This is a cute crawler but I couldnt remap keys to my play style and the mouse roll cant be inversed. Those two things added to the fact that once you're dead you're dead with no reload from a save point kill the fun for me. This game is a neat passtime and plenty of people like it. but im not really one of them. Indie developers should be encouraged and Delvers knows what they're doing and if they fine tune the controlls and let the game reload from save points at death I would have enjoyed this more.  As it is im done with it.   There is an indie crawler called Dungeon Odyssey thats been around for a few years thats carried by Malfador Machinations.

								Delver is hard, entertaining and beautiful. The areas are generated randomly, and each level you have to build up your character choosing between three random stats (exemple : you have to choose between health, speed and agility).This is exactly what I was expecting about the game. This is currently the 0.7, so it's likely the game will get deeper. Just take the game for the atmosphere (the game is really REALLY beautiful if you love the old school graphics), the gameplay (potions on the ground explode when you hit them, the traps can be activated with beer mugs, just so you know), and the difficulty (even first fights are easy, the game will kill you at any mistake you will do).

I had alot of fun going through all the levels of the dungeon until I realized that it was pretty much over. I understand that you have to have limited amount of levels to the dungeons so that the running back through the entire thing isnt too tedious, but part of me wants even more awsome level design like the rest of the game.

								This game is amazing! It reminds so much of Pixel Dungeon, except it's first person which makes it so cool! I love how simple the mechanics are, and especially how the food works. I also love the fact that you don't know what potions do until you drink them, and that traps do random things. I wouldn't say it's worth the $8 at the moment, but I am really glad that I bought it because it has so much potential to be even better.Some things I would recommend would be:- Option to sell items at the shops (hate to carry around 2nd best gear and have to leave it lying around)- Smaller minimap marker (the current arrow is way too big)- Mouse wheel to scroll through belt (using the numbers takes your hand off of WASD, which can get you killed since you can't move then)- Overworld map with multiple towns (then you can have a choice between what dungeons you want to go into, with each town having a dungeon that leans towards a different theme, like caves, bandits, etc.)- Jumping Maybe (the girl with the staff can jump, why can't I?)- COOP!!!! (this game would be awesome with a friend! although, I don't really know how you would pull that off...)These are just suggestions and I think the game could be even more amazing with them implemented (well, mostly the mouse scroll, minimap, and selling).

Now the negatives in this game is that when you die you start over. i dont like this and many owners may not like it neither id rather see a count on oh many lives you have left and when it runs out your done start over.potions in this game are all a mystery it could be health or higher defense and all that i dont like that. One last thing id like to see it bosses a big orgy or a dragon in this open area and a open word to explore. keep on dreaming i recommend this game.			"

								This is one of the few games I bought early on during the early access phase and can say I'm glad I did. Each update has brought improvements and squashed bugs. The devs also haven't just decided to abandon the game or completely change what they were going for in the first place. They just keep improving it and that alone is enough for me to recommend this game. The random level generation is some of the best I've seen in the genre thus far. I enjoy the art style and music as well. Its easy to get into but hard to master it. I still haven't made a single escape after 25 hours logged. In short, if you like crawling random dungeons in first person and don't mind the art style, then this is definitely something to pick up. Even at full price I highly recommend it. Underrated game by far IMO.			"

								Graphicly pretty bad, and occasionaly you might find a bug, But overall a difficult game, exciting and not impossible, with some variety for how short is it. The story dosen't really have much depth, but it has a story, and a randomly generated dungeon with simple controls and leveling up... worth the 5$ I payed for it, but just barely.			"

								I held of buying this for quite a while because I just wasn't sure.  STUPID move.  I enjoy this game WAY more than I expected.  I'd even say they could have charged more and I'd still be happy with it.  Such great fun to give in and see how long you last.  Since the dungeons are procedurally generated you never get the same thing.  I'm still finding new themed rooms and areas.Only bad thing is I have a huge urge to collect all the loot I find and there really doesn't seem to be a point to do that.  Just keep what's good and throw the old stuff on the ground, there is no selling.  I also wish you could see your character but again in a rogue type there really isn't a point to spend time with character creation.  If you die quickly you wasted all that time.  Being an RPG I just have that desire.It's only a few bucks.  Just buy it already.			"

								This game is seriously what one would call a Rogue-like done right! With procedurally generated levels you will find yourself facing new challenges with every run. Comparatively I would say that it is a great homage to games like Ultima Underworld. Your mission is simple enough, retrieve the treasure on the deepest level and then escape, but this game never really feels redundant in any way.Furthermore this game is CONSTANTLY being tweaked and improved. I've seen level layouts improved tremendouly, I've seen new music tracks added, new floors added and new challenges added. You will constantly find yourself juggling your strategies ranging from engaging enemies in hand-to-hand combat to picking off tricky enemies with a bow to firing powerful bolts from your various wands against tougher enemies.Very intense, very satisfying and very fun.

Early Access Review
Overview and Gameplay:Delver is a nifty roguelike rpg-light game with the basic idea of ""Go into random dungeon, get orb, get out."" Very simple premise but it works. Once inside the dungeon you cannot escape until you reach the end and grab the orb, followed by backtracking all the way to the beginning. Environment/UI:The look and feel of the game is very nice and detailed. Animations are fluid, lighting isn't too overpowering and neither are dark areas. I didn't feel the need to use a lantern/candle ever. Basically it's very Minecraft like but with a more SNES RPG style for sprites and you don't destroy/gather the environment. The dungeons are also littered with traps, lava and pits, so watch your step and remember to check behind you if backtracking too far.The UI is very simple: hold X amount of items and asign quick use ones to your ""belt"" for buttons 1-6. The game won't auto replace multiple of the same item, so don't rely on that if you're in a pinch. Everything is drag and drop, so you can throw away any unused items.Enemies:The enemy sprites have great attack/hit animations and it's very satisfying to splat goblins. Once you figure out how enemy attack animations go though, the difficulty is pretty much removed unless there's an area with a varying amount of enemy types, specifically magic users. Magic hits suck big time - magic animation speeds are very fast and will always hit if too close. Luckily they can be destroyed with your own magic or well-placed arrows.Stats:When you level you'll be given a choice to increase a single stat out of 3 options, however, there are 6-7 main stats in the game. I'm not sure how it selects which 3 to show you, as I've gotten the same option twice in a row and mixed, so it may be random. This can kind of be a pain if you really need more health but don't get the option for 2 levels. Available stats are attack, defense, magic, health, agility, and speed. They are self-explanitory except for magic and agility. Magic will increase the number of charges in wands, not the damage they do. Agility gives you faster movement when holding a charged attack. Items:The weapons and armor are pretty standard - leather, plate, sword, mace, bow, etc. The magic wands are nifty but the low amount of charges makes them more emergency items that are best used against other magic users. All food heals over time and is best used when you're retreating or right after a battle ends. Food is also good for combating poison as they basically cancel out. Weapon attacks can be made stronger by holding the attack longer, but each weapon has it's own timing animations. Getting that down makes strong attacks way easier to land.Potions are terrible. There are a couple different types but each time you load a new game the effects randomly change, so not all red potions will heal. This is a huge gripe as you have to try out each potion every time and essentially waste items so you know what to look for further into the dungeon. Another gripe is that potions do not stack like arrows (neither does food).Gold also drops from enemies, but in such low amounts that on my first successful playthrough I ended up with 774 and wasn't able to use any in the dungeon. The idea is that, when you finish the dungeon, you'll get to use the gold on a second playthrough so you can get some items on a brand new character, but this isn't as fleshed out as it could be. Items do not have any value and cannot be sold, so don't be like me and horde excellent items.Bottom Line:Delver was enjoyable once I got the hang of the items and felt comfortable using a weapon (mace). The visuals are great, animations solid, and the music was enjoyable and matched the asthetic of the game. I recommend the game, however, in it's current state there may not be enough replayability to keep me coming back. Some updates are needed to the UI/items, and if they expand on NPC sellers/items I think it would be even better.3 out of 5 stars/thumbs/pixels			"

								Just played for a few minutes and WOW! This is a great modernized throwback of RPG, dungeon Delving goodness. I'll be playing this more. Oh, and be careful. If you hit some potions, they explode. (ouch!)Update: MANY hours later...Guys 'n gals, buy this game. Srsly. I thoroughly enjoy Delver and I own it on Android as well. The mobile version is a bit behind the PC/Mac version, but definitely worth it. Let's be honest about rogue-likes: they're a dime a dozen. So many rogue wannabes on all platforms. So that begs the question: What makes Delver stand out? I'll sum it up in a short list.1. Atmosphere - music, environment, decoration, ambiance. They nailed it. 2. Mechanics - the gameplay is super simple but somehow I don't feel it's repetetive. 3. Monster variety - See #2; the variety of monster types and attacks keeps combat feeling fresh.4. Inventory/RPG aspects - The inventory is simple but covers all the bases. Easy-peasy, but deep eough now that they have rings, amulets, off-hand (shield, candle, etc.)That's my $.02. This game is a blast. Delver has improved upon the basic RPG/rogue elements, but not so much as to lose the heart and soul of the genre. Highly recommended.			"

								I must say this is a fine little game. Everything looks nice, the mechanics are well done, and it is fun to play.That being said I am running this game on Linux Mint and because the game is made with Java, it automatically works for Linux.  Well.. it kind of works.I am having a weird glitch/bug happen when I level up.  During the game play, upon leveling, I am unable to use my mouse on the menu where you upgrade your players stats. Instead the mouse is invisible and the characters camera still moves.  My most recent playthrough was great, until I level. I made it to cave 2 and when I leveled, I was unable to upgrade my stats and click done. Because of this, I had to quit the game.I would be happy to change this review, when this bug is fixed.  Honestly, I love the game, but this bug is very annoying.			"

								I'm really happy I picked up Delver. I had low expectations, but Delver has turned out to be one of the best roguelike dungeon crawlers I've played in quite a while. It's simple, and the graphics harken back to Daggerfall days, but it shines where it counts:- Dungeons are randomly generated (with some exceptions) and feel WORTH exploring. Maps are loaded with crevasses, bridges, hidden rooms, lava, underground lakes, traps, and more. Many maps have a 3D element to them, with bridges or loopbacks bringing you under or over an area you just walked through, or dark passages descending into gloom. If you're a completionist, there is true value in exploring every niche and nook, as the game will reward you with life-saving loot!- Loot! The loot system has more depth than you might guess. It's not Diablo, but there are some elements of the random-loot system here. The game will surprise you with finely crafted items from time to time, or weapons with elemental attacks, usually with some negative trait alongside (Broken 1-3 dmg dagger, with +3 ice damage). You have just enough space in your inventory that by dungeon level 5-6, you might have a full load (and no junk). This means careful inventory management.- Permadeth! You only die once, however you keep some of your money after death. This is useful in shops.Some other things to like about Delver:- Runs ridiculous framerates on my Macbook Pro and never even turns on the fan! My poor laptop isn't much of a gaming rig, but Delver apparently doesn't need one. It's easily the fastest and most responsive FPS-view game I own.- Loads and quits in seconds. You can boot the game and be playing in less than 10 seconds. To quit: ESC, Save, ESC drops you straight to desktop in about 3 seconds!Conclusion: Delver is an excellent choice for people who like RPG's, roguelikes, and exploration. It's lighthearted, but not dumbed-down or easy.			"

								I bought the game because it looked like fun and because I like Rogue-like games, but hell was I surprised how fun it is. Its really addicting and defenetly worth its price. It has awesome music, an easy game concept, it has smooth and simple controlls and an incredibly well created atmosphere. In addition to that it has a good replay value, because it doesnt really get you angry when you die. And also it has a touch of ""looting and leveling"" combined with the desire of exploring these random generated floors. And its simple graphics have a charm because they are mixed with modern shading- and ligh- effects. And in some areas like the sewer(3rd screenshot) it features this fog which I personally like because it just creates a really nice atmosphere. The atmosphere of the game feels right, the gameplay feels right, and so does the whole game. It sadly doesnt have much of a story, but thats pretty normal for rogue-like games.- Sadly the game still has a few bugs, for example: you can get stuck in certain areas(like the sewer), but you can just go in the folder of the savestates and then change your x,y and z coordinates with an editor.(-> Also the game has lots of mods etc, and it is very easy to mod the game, because its all open source(the game also has a level editor))So in conclusion I can say that the game itself is alot of fun and that it is a fair game with nice gameplay, a replay value and a great atmosphere. You might stumble upon some bugs, but its an early access game and these bugs are usually fixably by the player him-/her-self, so that isnt much of a negativ thing. In my opinion the game is a really well made indie/rogue-like game which I had much fun with. But in the end it is up to YOU if you are going to purchase it or not,either way, have a nice day!			"

								note i dont give a crap that my grammar or spelling is bad just saying. so Delver is a great game this game as potential to becoming big top selling. the songs the atmosphere is great and man the enemys are good too. now its still in its beta but i still enjoyed it and some of you out there may enjoy it to. Now the negatives in this game is that when you die you start over. i dont like this and many owners may not like it neither id rather see a count on oh many lives you have left and when it runs out your done start over.potions in this game are all a mystery it could be health or higher defense and all that i dont like that. One last thing id like to see it bosses a big orgy or a dragon in this open area and a open word to explore. keep on dreaming i recommend this game.			"

								OH man.  OH ok.  I think I am just broken in a way that makes me love this game a whole lot,  First thing, any random dungeon game gets my attention.   Second, any first person dungeoneering thing gets my attention.   So this is both and it's really good.  The art style is like some you have seen before but it is sweet.  Sweet in a way that evokes a certian feeling that other games that use a similar graphical tone really can't do very well.   Not sure how many folks are involved here, I know one might or might not be named Chad, but whoever does the art loves this game.  The fidelity of such would allow for one person to do a whole lot of work to enter in their own perfect vision of the art presentation for the game, and that is great.  By accident or by design it feels to me like the dungeon and the caves (the two locales I have seen so far) are part of cohesive whole that I really like.  The monsters and the npc enemies have good personality, and the sound assets created/selected for them fit very well.  Details regarding the movement of the character and his/her weapons lend the whole game a satisfying weight that just really scratches things that I  like to get scratched.  Combat has a dance like quailty that really changes based on the monster/enemy encountered.   After that it requires a bit of thinking that is easy to do usually but has lots of fun twists invovling number of enemies/elevations/weapons owned or currently using...  meaning that you will be rolling out hard one moment only to have yourself chased down into hard corners, stomping onto pressure plates and getting killed by traps you navigaed deftly only a minute before. Delver is really worth your time and money, and there should be more games like it.  Here's hoping that Chad and whoever make a mint of dollars and buy huge houses.			"

								It might not look like it from screenshots, but this humble game oozes polish in almost every respect. The animations, for example, are unbelievably slick, and they get across a real sense of responsiveness and weapon impact. Its the little touches of quality like that which set this game apart from the great steam sea of crap bandwagon rougelikes. And its that sort of thing which brings me back to this game time and time again, despite its simplicity. This game is a gem, an obvious labour of love, and more than your money's worth.			"

								Being a massive Ultima Underworld fan and Roguelike fan, this game is excellent for that. The dungeons are always different, and the levelling system is simple but effective.The enemies each have character and the jumping pink woman with a stick gets me every time! The skeleton wizards might fire too often for my liking, and the end-game chase is nothing but mental!But if you make sure you leave plenty of food and healing potions/scrolls that you have gathered near the end of each level... you might just have a chance of escaping alive.Personally I think this game is fantastic and am glad to see a new update, the temple maps are really nice! Congrats Joshua for creating and great game and offspring!			"

Now you can scroll through your hot bar with mouse wheel! Gasp!Anyho, here is to you guys and hopefully next update will be sooner then later.			"

Early Access Review
								(First of all, in the time that this was written, the game had just received an update after nearly a year, this is because one of the developers had a baby and they had to pause in the development. So if you read any more negative reviews that were made before or around the time this review was made, if they mention anything about the developers not updating, this is why.)Delver is a simple roguelike dungeon crawler that is, I believe, heavily influenced by games like DOOM and Zelda.The objective of the game is to enter a procedurally generated dungeon (Different every time) that consists of several floors with different themes, get the treasure, and return to the surface safely.I don't want to spoil to much, because Delver, I think, is supposed to give you a feeling of wonder, suspense, and the unknown. And, despite being very simple, I feel it somehow does this very well, even after playing the game multiple times. Which I think is why I love it so much. The game is somewhat difficult, maybe even unfair at times, but hey, why would the enemy make it fair in the first place?And also, that is part of the mystery, sometimes, dungeons are full of loot and as you make your way down, you will eventually become nearly invincible, other times, you really have to just make do what you have, and sometimes the traps and the general layout of the dungeon is a real pain in the butt. so, basically, the games difficulty is different EVERY TIME. Which, personally, I think is brilliant. But of course, I highly doubt anyone will be having any competitions with this for $10,000 anytime soon. Which is OK.I cannot express the feeling of winning this, especially for the first time. It makes my day even more than cookies do.Which is saying a lot. I challenge you to beat Delver, if you dare. But remember, it was hidden away for a reason.Edit: Some screenshots I took:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765355710http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765356107http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765355965 "

								This game is one of the most immersive games I've ever played, the game has some of the best scenery I've seen, just sit around in an area and observe your surroundings, it may be randomly generated, but everything looks like it was intricately planned. If I had to say one problem with this game, is that the game starts out throwing magic wands at you, really useful ones at that, and around the sewers level, you rarely see magic wands.			"

								I bought this game a while back. I haven't played it a whole lot but from time to time I play it for a bit. Delver itself is a fun game with a cutsie feel to it. Every time I play Delver I just wish it was more. I would love to see an Oblivion or Skyrim like game become of it one day; missions, crafting, classes, a world map. It would be amazing. As of now I can recomend this game for what it is a rouge-like dungeon crawler, featuring perma-death. It has a unique art style, similar to Minecraft, landscape wise. I truly enjoy this game for what it is.			"

								A nifty little early access game that is sure to entertain those who love the classic rougelike genre.The pixel graphics are detailed and well made which give a certain old school aesthetic adding to the tone and athmosphere of the gameplay.Some people have been worried about the current state of development for the game. Let me assure you that while this project had gone into Limbo in the past, since the last couple of months the small developer team has made the effort to increase their transparency with the community and has begun doing weekly streams to show the current state of development. That does not however imply that this game may again fall into development hell.Therefore in it's current state I feel that this game is worth the money, however i advise those with less money to spend on games to wait for it to be fully released or pick it up during a sale.Lastly, I believe that while I find this game very enjoyable, people who are not fans of permadeath and rougelike mechanics may find the game offputting.

								Its Early Access so I'm sure theres lots of things that can happen, but I'm not ready to say its something I'd reccommend. Its been in production for three years and seems like it has a lot to go to make it interesting for more than a couple runthroughs. Random Dungeon Crawling Rogue-Like Game. Its missing something big and its a combination of the mechanics and lack of really any substance that wont let me enjoy it as much as I feel I could. Pros: Completely random dungeon that works well. RPG Elements. Roguelike, so you never know what you're getting or if you have any chance to succeed. Money Carries over after you die.Cons: Unrefined interface, no story, visuals are hard on eyes trying to focus between like the 16 bit characters and semi 3D environment, been in development for a long time. No real drive to play through more than a few times.Overall, i'm not sure what can be added to make it more interesting. The Dev is looking for feedback, but the biggest thing would be to fix the cons. Not sure you you do that with the short playtimes. Why are you there, what are you doing, what is driving you, who are these people, what is the reward, what do I do with all this broken and useless stuff you accumulate, are some good questions to start answering.-Comiccomwww.thecomic-community.com "

								Overall an excellent game for what it is. Roguelikes and Dungeoncrawlers are my favorite genres of games and so when I came across this game I was really excited to play it. I bought it about a year ago and was somewhat disappointed with it but I think that it was just because I expected more than what it had promised. Overtime though I have found it to be a much more polished game than when it initially came out. I would just go into it knowing that you are getting a basic ""arrive at a dungeon and move through it killing monsters until the end"" type of game and not a more loot based ""diablo type"" game.

								I really like the game. I always love dungeon crawlers like this one, and the older pixel style of the game really appeals to a certain kind of player. Unfortunately, I've noticed a few issues with the game, given its early access status. The random generator for dungeon mapping doesn't always create a dungeon that can be completed. Sometimes you may enter a floor on which progress is impossible though an insurmountable object being generated between you and the next floor, and the game does not let you turn back to leave. This can happen on the first floor, or any floor afterward, no matter how far along in the game you are. A similarly game-breaking bug is the random generation of traps. Floor traps are, as far as I've seen, indestructible. One such trap teleports you. In my case, this one such trap teleported me to the room that the trap blocked the exit of, once again, I had to delete my file and restart.As soon as this game is finished and patched so that such severe bugs don't occur anymore, I have confidence in Delver becoming a truly great game.

Early Access Review
								A nifty little early access game that is sure to entertain those who love the classic rougelike genre.The pixel graphics are detailed and well made which give a certain old school aesthetic adding to the tone and athmosphere of the gameplay.Some people have been worried about the current state of development for the game. Let me assure you that while this project had gone into Limbo in the past, since the last couple of months the small developer team has made the effort to increase their transparency with the community and has begun doing weekly streams to show the current state of development. That does not however imply that this game may again fall into development hell.Therefore in it's current state I feel that this game is worth the money, however i advise those with less money to spend on games to wait for it to be fully released or pick it up during a sale.Lastly, I believe that while I find this game very enjoyable, people who are not fans of permadeath and rougelike mechanics may find the game offputting.

								Delver is an amazing rogue like dungeon crawler. It is beautifully optimized, playing on my schools $100 10"" laptops at max settings 60fps. It's challenging but relatively easy to figure out, has many little easter eggs, the gameplay feels nostalgic and original at the same time and there is a wide range of different weapons and enemies.

								A solid game from the start, Delver already feels like a finished product worth it's asking price.As it moves through early access the sky is the only limit, and I really look forward to seeing what it looks like when it's development has finished. EDIT: The developer came back after a really long hiatus. Review has been switched back to positive since the game hasn't been abandonded.			"

								If this game would update more frequently, it would be a really good dungeon crawler. By now it has a bunch of weapons options, but it still needs a better character upgrade system, and more random things happening in the game (shop specific items, and more random places to visit (altars, etc.)).And if devs are reading this - it'd be great to have a diffefrent levelng system. Maybe think about player finding ""essences"" or something, that would let player exchange them for stat upgrades (?). The point is, the leveling system is kind of weak right now.			"

								Good game, as a rare first-person roguelike. Pretty hard, for the same reason.  Expect to die.. a lot.The camera is one of the biggest issues with this title -- a bit of VR support would go a loooong way with this one, even if it just used Minecraft-like first-person controls, so the gameplay would be the same.  Crossing my fingers that the developers will add it, as this would undoubtably be an instant VR hit.			"

								Everything about Delver just makes me love it more. It's got 3D combat, but nice crunchy pixel graphics. It's difficult, but not rage-inducing, controller-throwing, primal scream-inducing difficult. Both magic and melee attacks are viable options, quite the rarity in my experience.Great dungeon crawler, one of my favorites!			"

								This game is amazing and somehow still in early access. It shouldnt still be in early access because theres like no f*cking bugs and the game is damn addicting in a fun way. But updates happen around every 9-12 months and just needs some more monsters and just an additional section of levels. If they work on it more it will be a damn amazing game and will come out of Early Access in around a year. Hopefully.			"

								I highly reccomend this game! While it is still being developed and is missing a few things here and there, it is great for those of you who enjoy dungeon crawlers, and pixels! If there is anything I could reccomend, its that the developers should add a little more to theoverworld, and some more bosses and floors. I think it would make this neat little game even more adventurous!			"

								Fun, and action-packed rouge-inspired clone.Before the workshop update, it would get old after a while, but now with the workshop update, you have an infinite realm of possibilities.I also see the workshop helping develop the game too, like with Minecraft, and it's moding community, I wouldn't be suprised if the 'Weapon expansion pack' , and 'Chezzy's crossbow mod' make it into the game.All, in all; 7.5/10 for what it currently is now.

								The reason for the low play time is because i play it before steam version...Ok, Where do I begin? This game is a thrill! You shoot, you slash, you have a blast (quick delver rhyme) You play as the delve person, The dungeon has many floors that you must conquer to win the game. There are better weapons and armor to get, I enjoy the simple graphic, sometimes the spider scares me and I need to look away for a moment! it has thrills such as this! sometime the bat come and hit me and I Jump in my seat with a startle, ""go to hell bat!"" I blabber. I feel for the people I kill in the dungeon, sometimes I kill on sight, This make me realize that i have not given the victim the benefit of the doubt, what if they are friend?

								The game is fun and intuitive but I have to say I docked points for finding a trap in a hallway I couldn't avoid in any way; The game doesn't allow you to jump and the way the tile was positioned it wouldn't let me pass without walking over the plate. Having to budget health for gauranteed damage from traps in a roguelike is like trying to pay your mortgage payment with dryer lint. You just don't have the ability to do that. However, I will be willing to play the game some more if I discover that was a very uncommon situation; IE, up until the point I encounter that problem again. If you enjoy roguelikes and you really liked the Might & Magic 1st person adventure games, you'll enjoy Delver.Update (Spoiler Warning): It is possible to deal with most traps without stepping on them even if they are between you and the path you need to go down, but there are still areas and configurations where they will always hit you, even if you try to disable them. Still holding my thumb up but sequels will need some tweaking.			"

Early Access Review
								Love the art style. I love this game so far but I think it feels a bit too plain and easy (not your normal rogue like). I know it's early access but there needs a variety of different enemies or different stats of enemies (say slimes... there should be fire, lava, water, etc slimes) I find myself running around and easily killing enemies. I should be afraid of the unknown not confident.And the traps are soooo soooo soooo obvious and visible. You can avoid it easily unless it's down a 1 block path. I think removing the huge plate and making it almost the same as the floor but different colour will make me not want to run around and be careful were I go.You can play all styles heavy warrior, archer, mage (no cast spells only wands I think. I haven't gotten far yet). The only enemies I encountered so far and I really hate that makes this game a bit challenging are those floating eyes of eyes that shoot burning balls. So op. I only find like 1-2 enemies each room. And that I can easily kill (again I haven't reached that far. I only reached ruins). If enemies were more difficult and more in numbers (could be a mod) I would love this game more.One last thing. All weapons and armors rings necklaces (foods?) Are all identified. Except for potions... I like the sense of having to be careful with everything you find and needing a scroll of identification to make sure the items are safe. (Cursed unfurled blessed etc). It made the game more challenging and a sense of wanting to beat the game. (I'm talking about nethack the origin of rogue likes ). So far I would recommend the game. I'm looking forward to the final product and hope they change it to the way I think it should be (or mods).			"

Early Access Review
								This is a fun, addicting game. I've barely had it for a day and I'm already hooked on it. There's plenty to explore, collect, loot, kill, and just look at. Given that this game is in Beta I believe, I'm expecting much more in the future. The pixelated art style is charming and adds a certain quality that makes it kind of light hearted and not too serious. That's also a good way to describe the game as well, since this game is pretty easy as far as Roguelikes go. The combat isn't anything special, but it's balanced and deep enough to keep it interesting while playing. I never found it to be tedious, and it was fun timing and landing charged attacks. The menus are a bit confusing though. Nothing really goes in depth in explaining them and I'm still not sure if I've got it all figured out. The default button for your inventory is ""I"" which is a bit out of the way and inconvenient considering that the main form of movement is WSAD. If there's more movement options or a way to change the controls, I am unaware of those at this time. Another problem I had with the menus was using items. There's no indication of what button does what, nor is there any explanation as to what anything does. I had a potion in my hot bar so I could drink it. Instead, I threw it on the ground, and it exploded. It took me a minute to realize that to use some items, you had to be in your inventory, which can be a hindrance in tense moments of battle where you need something from your inventory and quickly. There's definitely room for improvements to menu functionality and more, even if small and brief, tutorials. A note saying ""Drink potions from your inventory and put them on your belt to throw them!"" would be just fine. Other than those, this game is pretty solid and simple, and has room to expand upon in the future. If you're looking for your next short addiction (or maybe even a long one) this is a good game to look into.			"
