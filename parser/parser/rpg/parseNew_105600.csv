												You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun. You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats. You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble. It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there. It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination.			"

IntroductionI am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015: With the release of Update 1.3, Terraria has become three hundred times better. Update 1.3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more. The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done. The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself. Including the new gamemode known as ""Expert Mode"" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'. Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners). How I Found Out About ""Terraria""I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube. I randomly came across a video called ""Terraria"". I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself. It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits. Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I MUST have it.Unfair First ImpressionsWhen ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear ""Minecraft clone"" or ""2D Minecraft"". Which is incorrect on so many levels. If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft. Review Of Terraria Terraria is a very unique game for what it does. There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before. Terraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's Example on the kind of enemies you could come across. Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton.As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.""Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?""Good question. Let's get that.Items & FurnitureThis is where Terraria gets big. Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single small world and still have many things to do.In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience. Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground.The weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated. Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes. Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come. It's a steal for the price of $9.99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2.00 or less. This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience. Pro's:+Loads of content for hours of game time.+Great combat system.+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.+Provides a good challenge.+Fun and creative boss battles.+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters.+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility.Con's:-No infinite world option. (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)Overall Rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.			"

												To commemorate the beta of Steam Reviews, as well as passing 1,000 hours in Team Fortress 2, it only makes sense that I finally write a recommendation for a game that has been close to my heart since the day I was first introduced to it: Terraria.Terraria has proven to be a lot of fun to play, and has been one of my biggest video game time sinks in recent years because of it. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a broad permittance for exploration and a wide selection of building decor, it's the type of game that strikes me as having something for everyone. Which is good, when you consider that it also has multiplayer. Even better when you get to the late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors and tools to allow for a wide variety of specializations.Building and exploration are strong points in favor of the game, but the gameplay mechanics are something I'd like to single out for praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a lot of spectacle, and perhaps that's part of why I find it so charming. Hurting enemies--even those who are vastly inferior to you--feels good. It's satisfying to hear the hit sound on the more squishy enemies, and watch them explode into fine little chunks when they die. Ground movement could be better, but certain late game items give you the ability to dash and fly, which really expand how you can explore and fight. And with a wide selection of weapons, every player is bound to find a roster of tools, spells and fish-related artillery that fits their playstyle.The game isn't without flaws, mind you. With the game's update history, the launch endgame now vastly differs from that of the current one. This has led to some balance and progression issues, the most glaring of which being how sluggish the early game feels. It worries me that the start of the game might dissuade some people from playing, when they might love what the late game has to offer. The game also has a bad habit of recycling mob AI with reskins, though this is averted by adjusting certain parameters and giving them unique abilities to hide the fact. Even though I have more to say about the shortcomings, there's just too much good in the game to stay mad about what effectively boils down to nitpicking.Plus, it has hats. Any game that has a selection of hats gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other reviews. If this looks like something you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a chance. The game occasionally goes on sale for 75% off, so pick up a four pack for yourself and three friends. If I'm wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I'm sorry. But if I'm right, then it'll be well worth the price. We're expected to pay $60 these days for a fulfilling gaming experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.			"

												Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends.			"

												When I first saw my friend playing Terraria, I thought it was a 2d MineCraft. Now that I've logged over 150 hours into it, I see that Terraria is so much more than Minecraft.

Hopefully, I can do this right:ExplorationTerraria2d side-scrollingMultitude of biomes to explore(Around 38)You can find loot and ore, without even going undergroundMinecraft3d worldMultitude of biomes to explore(Around 61)You can find loot, and bars or metal above ground as well(Minecraft Wins)Spelunking(Mining/Underground Exploration)Terraria13 ores, plus an additional 4 ores once in hardmodeGenerated caves, as well as, other aspects of underground like Abandoned mineshafts, houses, temples, etc.You can dig straight down to hell!Minecraft7 oresGenerated Caves, Ravines, Mineshafts, 3 Strongholds, and Monster SpawnersYou can grind for obsidian, make a portal, and set it on fire to go to hell!(Terrria Wins)Crafting(Not including Weapons/Armor)TerrariaUsing around 38 crafting stations(including Honey,Lava, and Water) You can craft anythingIf you don't know what an item requires, you can ask the Guide Npc for help(See Npc)In layman's terms, you can make blocks, walls, potions, accesories, tools, torches, boss spawners(See fighting), dyes, grapple hooks, and pets, and decorations(including pots, beds, etc.)MinecraftUsing 2 interfaces, a player can craft some stuff they want to(being forced to grind for the rest)If you don't know how to arrange the items on a grid, you can look it up on the wiki!In layman's terms, you can make blocks, crafting stations, torches, tools, and decorations( including pots, and beds)(Terraria Wins)FightingTerrariaThere are 392 enemies in Terraria, including the bossesThere are 18 bosses in Terraria.(The celestial towers were each counted separetly)You can make 15 sets of weapons and armor from the ores aforementioned.

Product received for free
												This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.The essence of Terraria is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.Pros Customization: There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage. Exploration: The Terraria world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see ""The Creation of the Guide"" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the Terraria world, you discover something surprising. Creativity: Terraria is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. Terraria features innovative design at its finest. Progression options: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.    You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently had too many options and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive. Balance: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. Terraria manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress. Diversity: Terraria promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.    I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible. Automation: Terraria would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores. Performance: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. Terraria is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*Starbound*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy Terraria in its full glory. Quality of life: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is Terraria's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface. Continued updates: It would be very easy for Terraria, as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.Cons New player friendliness: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in Terraria's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game. Grinding: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet Terraria is not above this issue. Moddability: Terraria is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay. "

												I always thought that terraria was a great game, but after 1.2 patch it became one of my personal favourites! This game is a 2D RPG-platformer in randomly generated worlds. Loot, that you can find in game is important, but not as much as your skill! Try it out, if you like challenging games with almost endless replayability!			"

												Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).

												Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the ""crafting"" genre seriously. These were my first impressions.However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!). The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years).			"

												Terraria is a sidescrolling sandbox rpg. The game uses procedurally generated maps to provide the player with a unique experience every time. While some say the game is a ripoff of Minecraft it is, imo,  rather a testement to what Minecraft could have been.  The game uses a sidescrolling pixelated style and focuses on the standard rpg fare of collecting items and then using them to explore locations and fight bosses to collect more items. The game focuses less on the creation aspect of sandbox rpg and moreso on the rpg part while Minecraft does the opposite. While the game has a variety of cosmetics and various building materials that simply isn't the point of the game. The point of the game is fighting the boss, progressing to the next level, and getting to, and beating, the inevitable hard mode.  This focus does mean that the game eventually, like all rpgs, dims out and you will find yourself unable to progress and not so willing to farm for rare items. It is an issue experienced by even MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. Terraria sadly does not come out with enough large updates (Expansions if you wil) to warrent continous playing from update to update.  The bosses are varied and the enemies are fun to fight, the caves are fun to explore etc. Everything you would want from a sandbox rpg game but unlike Minecraft's seamingly endless tracks of land you can easily explore the entirety of your Terraria world. This is sad as some things such as Pyramids, ice caves etc are not going to spawn on every world unlike in Minecraft where it is simply walking around trying to find the right biome. This issue is actually an odd one. As all the creativity in building a house could go to waste when you find there is not teh right biome you are looking for on this world. The act of having to world hop with your character is a poor one and while it is there for a reason the fact that there is a chance you will HAVE to do it is saddening and ruins a portion of the game and breaks imersion. Another issue the game struggles with is online play. Unlike games such as Diablo where the enemies grow in strength the more players that are in a single game the mobs of Terraria do not care if as many as 8 people are in their world they will stay the same strength. This makes large parties of friends able to easily chew through a majority of the game undergeared as they may be. And while they require more resources to upgrade there are so many of them to fight and die to kill the boss that it does not neccessarily matter. This means that while playing alone can be incredibly difficult and require alot of pre-planning and execution with multiple people you just kind of gang-bang the boss until it stops moving and drops it's loot. The various classes (Magic, melee, ranged etc) are fairly balenced with Melee providing the most armor but doing the least damage  in and so on in standard RPG fashion. While the game does have issues it is still a great sandbox rpg that can provide hours of fun especially when played with a  few friends so as to keep the game challenging. Defining your character, mineing and crafting your weapons and armor, building a small village for the npcs to live in all feels good and is fun to do either alone or with friends.  I rate the game, in it's current state, a 8.3/10			"

 Terraria	Terraria is an amazingly fun to play 2D sandbox game. You start off with nothing but as you discover Terraria you notice how much is in this game. Stats	Here are some general stats about Terraria to give you an idea of how impressive this game is.Terraria contains:- 2748 Items- 401 enemies- 76 potions- 69 swords- 34 bows- 30 guns- 21 bossesAs you can see Terraria contains a massive collection of fun. Gameplay	You will start off by creating your character and creating your world. A nice feature to note is that you can have your character travel through multiple worlds while keeping their items. You will be thrust into a new world where you will have to gather resources and upgrade your arsenal. Night in Terraria is not as forgiving as Minecraft. After you survive you will continue to build up your personal collection while building a house. You will build a house so that random people can move in take up a room and rip you off with prices (jk not all prices are bad). Eventually you shall fight your first boss and bosses in Terraria will give you a run for your money so you better be prepared guys and gals.  Singleplayer/Multiplayer	Terraria is a fun game and even more fun with friends. Friends will help you out and make it easier to advance without dying.... too much :D. However if you do not feel like playing multiplayer singleplayer is just as fun. In single player you do not have to share your loot and your friends are incapable of stealing it, because it is singlepalyer.  Hardmode	Hardmode is a gamemode that Terraria automatically places you in after you beat The Wall of Flesh. In Hardmode you will meet new bosses and new enemies. You will find new materials and you will quickly realize every is much tougher and you need to quickly upgrade yourself.  Rating	 Pros	+ Smooth gameplay+ Have not felt lag as of yet+ character customization+ huge amount of weapons+ HARDCORE+ entertaining for hours + huge amount of armour sets with special abilities Cons	- a lot to grasp for a new player to Terraria (I dont think i can think of any more)  Final Thoughts	Terraria is an amazing 2D sandbox that tests you. This game has given me hours upon hours of fun and I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who has money in their wallet.  Final Rating 10/10	 "

												Before you read, Terraria is NOT a copy of Minecraft.In my opinion, Minecraft is a fun and really good game for building, but I stopped playing it of boredom a couple months after getting it. I did not play it every day. Now, Terraria is good for Building, Exploring, Fighting, Destroying, and is rewarding. Minecraft is very unforgiving; When you die you lose all your stuff and you usually can't get it back in time. In Terraria you can choose to only drop your money (It's easy to get it back.), you can choose to lose some of your items, or you can make your character die forever so you need to make a new one. I have been playing Terraria for +150 hours and I am still not bored of it the slightest bit. Also, if you still think it is a ""Stupid Rip-off of Minecraft"" I am fine with that, BUT notice Terraria has 14 bosses... in PC. Minecraft has 3. ( Thanks for telling me =-=TheDragonBorn03=-=! ) Terraria has +70 Swords And +50 Armor sets while Minecraft has less than 10 of both of those. I hope this review helped you chose wether to buy this game or not, And thank you for reading this far! So, in my opinion,Minecraft is the superior for building and has almost endless worlds horizontally.Terraria is the superior for Fighting, Exploring, And looting. It is also very addictive and it is hard to pull yourself away from it.Honestly, I get on Terraria for multiple hours a day and I get on it every day.Also, The bosses are hard, especially during Expert or Hardmode, and they give you a sense of achievment when you beat them.Just noticed that I am comparing not reviewing -_- Well, Here's a bit of a review. Terraria Is fun and when you kill a boss they drop some pretty useful Items, and there is really progress because as a beginner stuff like crimtane and shadow scales and demonite and tissue are pretty good. When you advance that stuff is considered garbage. Killing the Eye Of Cthulu is challenging... until you kill the wall of flesh or some others. Once you kill the wall of flesh for some reason... (COUGH) progress (COUGH) All non-hardmode bosses become easy.. Byyyyeeee			"

												Oddly enough, Terraria was the first game I'd bought on Steam.  I had been away from PC gaming for a fair amount of time and a good friend had discovered the game on SA and started pestering me to play.  The buy in was dirt cheap and it looked mighty weird with it's retro chic graphics, but I figured if said friend was so fired up about it, I might as well give it ago.  All of the praise I could find at the time compared it to Minecraft, so I was a bit leary.  I'd watched my kid play hours of Minecraft and it just wasn't my bag.  I'm glad I was able to push that stigma aside, because I ended up finding a gem of a game that pulled me away from my fancy consoles for a good chunk of time. We've all been kids; kids love to explore.  Exploration is the foundation of Terraria.  You start out with nothing more than a pick axe and a large map, then you're left with simply trying to figure out what's there.  Start to dig, maybe build a house and you're off and running.   There's something mentally satisfying about being able to click away at the soft earth, digging a path ever deeper.  It may seem pointless, but as you tunnel down, maybe you take a jog to your right and all of a sudden a hidden cave opens up before you.  Dig some more, perhaps you find an underground lake.  Maybe after a few hours of digging, you find something far more sinister.  Then, you spice things up by spinning up a server and letting your friends join you, and now you're working in conjunction, worming your way through the contryside with a misdrected sense of manifest destiny, coupled with the thrill of shouting 'ooh, look what I found!' and getting them to come see. Terraria's not flashy, but it doesn't need to be.  It's a relaxing good time and it'll bring you a wee bit of the childhood joy of exploring.			"

It's still receiving content updates, and at this specific period of time (years after release) they're rather constant. All for $2.49? Yes please.

												This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do. There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!Now this Game might not have the best ""graphics"" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way. I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!			"

												Terraria is a small 2D adventure game. I will review the game in some paragraphs, and then I will give it 1-10 points.[Gameplay]In the beggining, your quest it's to find wood, and make a shelter to survive the first night. ""The First Night""-that was the longest nigh in Terraria for me. Then, the game starts getting harder and harder. There are zombies, slimes, skeletones, Bosses and many, many other creatures. It's very interesting game! 10/10[Crafting]Ah.The crafting system in this game is quet hard to solve.It was hard to me, I didn't know even how to make a torch.The coolest thing about the crafting system is that, you only need the items for the thing you want to craft, not like in Minecraft, where you need to put every material in some ""speacial"" position. If you're a new player, talk to the first person you see in the game. Just do it!!! 9/10 It was hard...[Bosses]This is the coolest part of the game. Beating the bosses! So, The Bosses are made on 2 difficults, Easy and Hard.If you fight on easy difficult, don't worry. The Bosses have like 2k HP to 10k HP. They can be easly beaten up with a good armor and good weapons. IF YOU ARE A NEW PLAYER DON'T START WITH THE HARDMODE! JUST DON'T!!!On Hard mode, the Bosses are very hard, and If you die, you lose the game... Ex. The Eye Of Cthulhu it's on 2,8k HP on Easy, but on Hard mode, the Eyes are two and their name is ""The Twins"" The one have 20k, the other 23k HP.Good luck! 11/10[Multiplayer]Oh my God. This is the game I can play with friends forever! It's very funny and when you and the crew get all on HardMode characters and start beating bosses, it's cool. The worstest thig is that, Terraria is made on Small, Medium and Large terrain. This is the worstest thing, not like in Minecraft, to be infinite. But it's a'ight. 8.5/10 Can be better.[Final Review]""Terraria"" is a very good game. Even better than Minecraft, lol. So BUY it, what're ya' waiting for? This is an big adventure in a small world, which can be played with friends. What more do you need? 9.5/10 - I highly recommend this game!*Sorry for my bad english!*			"

												""This game is a Minecraft clone"" -A Suck-up Minecraft Fanboy/Fangirl, May 16 2011-PresentThe only reason they claim it's a clone is because it's open world, and has a few similar weapons (which technically, a lot of games have swords, and Minecraft wasn't the first) but overall, the un-modded version of Terraria is actually better than most modded Minecraft games, in my eyes. Some people complain that this game doesn't have enough content or doesn't get updated enough, and then claim that Minecraft is better (even though Minecraft only has at most 1/4th of the amout of items Terraria contains). Minecraft has had more updates overall and is barely as complex as the coding in this game! There are only a few things I find extraordinary in Minecraft: Creepers, anything involving the Nether, anything involving the End, and anything involving the Mushroom Islands. The list is so much bigger for Terraria! There are even more than 10 bosses and countless enemies that are either semi-original or 100% original. In fact, the only thing I wish Terraria had that Minecraft had was more mod makers and map creators. This game isn't even 'endless' like Minecraft claims, and still packs more of a punch with just a few content updates over the years! I strongly reccomend this game (if you can't already tell). This game should set the standards for upcoming sandbox games: lots of items, the developers stay in touch with the community, and has so many more enemies than any other game that you will be like:0_0 WOW.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Terraria  Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Open-world; 2D; Sandbox; Survival; Multiplayer My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Sandbox players; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWTerraria is already a well-known game. There probably isn’t much I can say which hasn’t already been said. Many gamers have heard of it, and many gamers know it is considered to be generally “great,” transcending most genre preferences and prejudices. And I now count myself among those people. But the inherent quality of Terraria  isn’t necessarily that obvious when a total newcomer decides to give it a shot, as the game can be quite uninviting at first. And that is something I want to address.So I will tell you, like the thousands of others, that Terraria is an incredibly enjoyable game. It is hard to concisely describe exactly why it is so enjoyable; but it basically boils down to the fact that there is an air of quality inherent to every gameplay aspect and those aspects synergize so well that that quality is multiplied exponentially in the end result.But when I first decided to try it, I failed three times to get into it.  Each time I sat down and tried to see what all the fuss was about, but each time I wound up extremely bored and confused as to why I couldn’t see what was supposed to be so fun about it.  The lack of any clear purpose and direction at the start of the game had me running around with no real incentives, and it ended up feeling unrewarding. Then I played with some new friends online who could offer a bit of direction. We started a new world together and the next thing I knew hours had flown by and I realized that I was finally enlightened.It was difficult to get over the initial hump of a learning curve and having a starter character.  There is no tutorial, there are no objectives; simply moving around is tedious at first, the digging is slow, and the building options are minimal… and it can all feel rather boring. But when you finally start making progress into the game, all the upgrades and item-tiers you climb through feel so gratifying. And I think having that initial slow-climbing grind at the start is a major part of what makes the game so satisfying once you finally delve into the heart of it.Once you reach this point of enlightenment, you will be eager to explore all that Terraria has to offer.  Hunt down exotic loot.  Fight epic boss battles.  Build giant castles with thousands of items. Make new friends and enjoy the enormous replayability of playing online. Maybe even try a role-play server. There are many hours of fun to be had.Perhaps the only negative aspects worth noting are the simplistic graphics and the lack of any clear story-mode. But due to the great gameplay and nature of the game, both of these things are easily dismissed as a non-issue by most. That said, if you really like story-driven experiences and/or gorgeous, current-gen graphics, you definitely won’t find those here.So in short, Terraria is something that can be easily enjoyed by almost any gamer. If you haven’t yet given it a go, you should probably consider it. It is a pretty safe bet for all but the most extremely discerning gamers. Just don’t forget that it may feel boring at first, but it is worth fighting past it; and playing with some people online can make it significantly more fun, especially when you are new.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I NEVER expected this game to be as complex as it is!At first I checked it out and was like ""Yeah, this looks kinda like Minecraft in 2D"" and I got into exploring the world, finding items and quickly realized there is WAY MORE than I expected. In the beginning, farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow, but once I looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps I was hooked for it.I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun. I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime. Do I recommend this game?Yes! Absolutely! If you don't mind the slow beginning and love exploring and experimenting with new stuff this game is for you!PS: There are some pretty amazing items inthe game, if you get far enough! :D			"

												Terraria is a 2D Sandbox Adventure game that's all about building and fighting giant monsters. Sounds like another popular game, right? I assure you, it's nothing like it.In Terraria, you are the player. A custom created character that has the sole goal of defeating the final boss and restoring the world to peace. Not to say that the game doesn't have it's fair share of building, aswell.The combat is sort of simple, yet charming. I always love going on expert mode with my end-game character and fighting a bunch of bosses. It's always good fun.And while I may not be the best at building, I enjoy it too.Terraria has to be my favorite game of all-time. Period.Just throw 10$ USD at the screen to get it, seriously. It's dirt cheap.If i missed anything in this review, don't tell me. Go make your own review. I'm sure you can make something that's much better than what i can do...What's that? You already own the game? Well what the hell are you doing here, go play it!			"

												This game is AWESOME. Best 10 dollars I EVER spent.It's a game about you start out in a world, and your main goal is to defeat bosses. Each boss will help you defeat the next one, and eventually a boss called the Wall Of Flesh will be defeated. Once you defeat this boss, your world will enter Hardmode, which will make everything harder. You have to push through a bunch more bosses, and do a bunch more grinding. Then you will find a cult at your dungeon, and..... I can't tell you all in this cramped space.Most weapons and armor and potions are really balanced, and there are 4 classes- Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Summoner.  I can't spoil too much more, otherwise it won't be as much fun. Go play Terraria now!			"

												I Myself enjoy building, mining and open ended games. This is something different though. It combines the adventurous feeling of ""path of exile"" and the 2D yet amazing type of art of ""starbound"" and ""edge of space"". This came as a gift from my brother. He noticed that I was getting kinda left out because a few of my friends could play it and I didn't have it, so he spent his own money, or steam credit, to buy me this game. It is worth the cost and will bring you a lot of enjoyment. Thanks bro.Many people would call this ""2D Minecraft"" and ""pointless, silly and plain rubbish"". I however disagree, as this game has more enemies, bosses, items, biomes and many more. This game is out on many platforms and I simply love this game. 9.5/10. I would like to give my thanks to re-logic and the rest of the group for this game. It is astoundingly beautiful.I shall now talk about the gameplay. You may customize your character's original look, and can have extra items in your accessories bar to increase strentgh, allow double jump, save you from from injuries by dodging, etc. You also have a vanity bar to put on cloths over your armour, therefore letting you have a nice amount of defense without clamping down on your style. You have a bigger inventory and hotbar than minecraft and better items, too. You can be wearing a big bulky helmet made of toughened mushroom while also wearing a rainbow coloured bowler hat. I personally collect hats as a hobby, so I could wear a turquoise fez or boater while also have on a high end helm. The multiplayer allows pvp, and it's own version of ctf (capture the gem). It also has teams, allowing you to play pvp in a group if your friends without killing each other. This game has a wide range of NPCs, ranging from an arms dealer to a party girl. The nurse can be a bit rude though... But I don't care. She gets the job done. You can build a condo by the ocean, or a mansion in the roots of a tree. You can hollow out hell, or reside in the clouds. You could even build a secret hideout hidden in a lava pool. The crafting is fun, you can make potions easier than in minecraft, and the traders don't go ""HMMM"". That is an automatic upgrade.I just love this game, and if anybody says that it is bad, then I have a tear run down my cheek. Just joking.I would like to thank: Redigit, D-town, Cenx, Crowno, Will, Aaron, Jim, and anybody else who helped make this game. I have changed my rating from earlier: 10/10. Terraria has a lot of potential, yet is still a FANTASTIC game. Anyway you look at it, it is full of colour and beauty. Thanks. This is a true game.			"

												I sometimes find myself envying people who sit down to play an outstanding video game for the first time. It's like a Christmas morning: putting the toy back under the tree and tearing opening the box all over again will never quite replicate the excitement of seeing it for the first time. Terraria is this sort of game. Starting a new world with a new character still feels like an exciting adventure, but the experience of stepping into that bright two-dimensional world for the first time, and discovering piece-by-piece all that it has hidden, is worth the asking price all by itself. Subsequent playthroughs only add to the value, and how! And if it's on sale - it is, often - I can only advise you not to hesitate.Terraria is a very versatile game. You can play for hours at a time, clocking up days' worth of play, and still have a 'to-do' list as long as a Bone Serpent. Alternatively, you can casually dip in and out when the mood suits you, building a little here, digging a little there, working on some great artifice a bit at a time. You can challenge gods and monsters with the finest weaponry crafted from the rarest metals, or simply make a treehouse for all your NPC friends with matching furniture sets and mood lighting. Become an arctic explorer! Go fishing! Drain the ocean into the dungeon! (I have actually done this, it was hard work but good fun.) Go to hell - literally! You can try to be bored, but it will take a lot of effort.One of the advantages Terraria has over so many other games is the involvement of a dedicated development team. When updates come  - and they may not come forever - they add great stores of content to the game, with new NPCs, items, mechanics, enemies and locations, not to mention all the tweaks and fixes which aim at keeping everything balanced, no small feat given that every change has to keep Terraria accessible to new players, whilst offering bigger and better challenges to existing players whose kingdoms span from ocean to ocean. This is all done remarkably well: the devs maintain a good community, and there is always the sense that the players are being listened to when new content arrives, without ever compromising the creative vision behind it. In an age of cowboy developers, corporate spin and micro-transactions on every street corner, Terraria is a welcome example of good practice in video games, and if I needed to buy it again, I would quite happily pay the full price - although, as I said, sales do happen.Of course, nothing is perfect, and nothing is for everyone. When it comes to armour and weapons, and things forged out of fantastically rare ores, it can be very 'grindy' (if that's a word). Building anything of any real size takes time, as does the collection of large quantities of wood and stone and whatever else you may be using to put together your palace. Boss fights can take a lot of preparation, and the later-stage bosses can feel genuinely punishing when attempted repeatedly. As a rule, I find that Terraria is very good at compensating for these issues, (a quick trip to collect wood for house-building can turn into a hectic race through zombie-infested tundra, or an expedition to recover unknown loot from the bottom of some murky chasm,) but not everyone will want to give it their time. A mere two dimensions may be a deal-breaker for some, not to mention the rather old-school, pixel-y art style. But even if this sounds like you, I recommend giving it a try. For me, Terraria worked where Minecraft didn't, and I still feel that the former deserves some of the credit that is typically heaped upon the latter. So give it a go, walk around that forest for the first time, dig a little below the surface and see if the spirit of adventure takes you. If it does, keep digging - after one year and 262 hours of play, I still haven't stopped.			"

												Terraria, the best sandbox game on Steam. Well, that is obviously my opinion and to me, it holds true. The first thing you should realise about Terraria is that there is no real ""story"" to the game. Besides collecting resources, building a base and most of battling the fierce monsters that Terraria has to offer. And oh BOY does it have monsters. I think the best place to start this review would be talking about what I love about the game and what I sometimes wish was worked on a little bit.Firstly, what I really love about this game is the sense of accomplishment. And I don't mean accomplishment as in ""congrats, you killed a single enemy here's 100 great items and 20 achievements"". I mean accomplishment as in you fight your hardest and kill a boss which you've been grinding for (will expand on this point later), which gives you a good item. Now, once again, when I say a good item I in no way mean game winning or game breaking items. I mean items that should carry you through until the next boss and the cycle continues.Now, as I said earlier about grinding. Yes, this game does have grinding in it. However I deem it necessary to explain how grinding i this game differs to grinding in an RPG. First and foremost, yes this game will require a bit of grinding just to get something new and helpful in your quest. However you must not worry. If you choose to grind alot, which I know most people will choose to do, you will get better gear. However if you just run in and collect all ores that you see and kill everything that wants to do harm towards you, you'll still get good stuff; stuff that will help you defeat the next boss. So, to sum that up let me put it like this; This game doesn't require you to grind, just to dig and collect everything that you need for that next big battle.Speaking of bosses, this game has multiple (14, to be exact!), all of which are unique. I'm going to talk about 3 of the main bosses that you'll be seeing early on in the game. Those 3 bosses are Eye of Cthulu, The Eater of Worlds (The Brain of Cthulu on Crimson worlds!) and Skeletron. Each of these bosses are VERY unique. Now, whilst I don't want to spoil these bosses, I think the best way to describe them is like this:- Eye of Cthulu is a giant eye boss which charges you down and enters rage mode after a certain amount of damage is dealt.- The Eater of Worlds is a giant worm which will home in on you as you destroys it's segments, each dropping loot.- The Brain of Cthulu is a giant brain (suprisingly!). It spawns eyes which have to be defeated before attacking the actual brain itself.- And finally, Skeletron. Skeletron is a monstrous skeleton, with 2 hands which can be destroyed to make the fight easier. What I really love about these bosses is how different they all are from each other. End game bosses are equally amazing, but may require a giant WALL to be passed. Could cause a lot of FLESH wounds, if you catch my drift. End/Hardmode bosses are amazingly well done and should honestly is one of the most well done things in this game.Enough about the bosses, let's talk about weaponry. There's a multitude of weapon TYPES to choose from. Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. And the amount of weapons within each catagory is well.. It's insane to be quite honest with you. If you're not enjoy swords, why don't you switch up to a staff which spews magical balls of damage to your foes? This game has a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and with that you also get the different armour types to help you. Once again, armour comes in a multitude range; Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. Now, some people may not exactly understand what the classes are so let me help you understand what they are.- Melee is predominantly swords and some other weapons like maces and things like that- Ranged is mostly bows, guns and all the things like that.- Mage is staffs, books of magic and guff like that.- Now summoner, is where people probably don't understand what it is. Summoner allows you to summon minions to help you fight, like Slimes, Ravens and Pygmys.Finally, where this game kinda falls short. I mean, it's nothing 100% game ruining. Achievements. OKAY, OKAY, LOWER THE PITCHFORKS, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF! I love the achievements in this game, they're fun, rewarding and allow me to play a different way in the game. But some of them are just so damn grindy. I mean, I think if you've played this game you understand where I'm going with this; the God damn Angler missons. I don't want to spend my time fishing when I could be fighting badass bosses and having a ball of a time. I don't want to fish. It's not as if it's just 5 or 10 times. It's 250 times. I don't want to fish for that long. Look, this game is damn near perfect and there's no way I can deny that. The constant work the devs put in is astounding and I must say that it's amazing the time and dedication they put into it. And, well, it paid off. This review is simply a slither of what the game is. And with that, I bid you all goodbye and farewell. I hope you have an amazing day or night dependant on your timezone!Enjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator! I recommend many games similar to this one. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JacksGamesOfChoice#curation "

Product received for free
												Holy hell. What a ride this has been. I first recieved this game when I was selected as the winner of a giveaway. I thought, ""Whatever, I've played Minecraft. This game is probably the exact same as it."" After all, there are certain similarities between both games. Find yourself stranded in the wilderness, mine ores and create some bland weapons and kill a generic boss and win.But the similarities end exactly there.Now, this game, in the starting phase, is actually quite bland, and I nearly quit because of it at first, but with the help of some friends, I stuck with it. It was pretty generic stuff. Mine some boring ores, build a boring house, feel the occasional rush of excitement of succesfully spelunking a cave and escaping unscathed with a new weapon, or dying and dropping your money. You'll die quite a bit as well, but don't let that discourage you. The moment I realized the exact depth of the game (and realized Iactually loved this game) was the moment my friends and I summoned what is to be considered the first boss, the Eye of Cthulu. The intensity of the battle, especially with our underprepared selves and crappy armor (hint: armor is your best friend!) made victory all the more satisfying. The adrenaline rushes as a boss attack leaves you at low health and your struggle to survive easily surpasses Minecraft in it's entertainment value. Yet I believed that was all the game had to offer, that one bit of awesomeness.WRONG! Excluding event bosses, there are over 14 different and unique bosses of Terraria, each with their own unique powers, and in Expert mode, their strength is vastly increased and each boss gains a lethal special attack, from the Eye of Cthulu's blinding fast rushes to the Skeletron's deadly skull spin. No two bosses are the same, nor can they be approached in the same way. Nearly every boss requires meticulous planning and building. But that's not all. because you know what's better than killing a boss?Sweet, sweet loot. Emerging victorious from a boss fight is definitely cause for celebration, but emerging victorious with a new weapon is even better. From shields that allow for bash-like charging, to a scarf that reduces damage by 17%, every boss kill is new and gratifying with the loot.Now, about now is where you can pick your specialization, especially if you're playing with friends. Will you be the hulking tank, absorbing all of the damage to protect your teammates? Or the looming mage, casting deadly spells from behind, or an archer, raining down death from above? It doesn't matter. After all, in Terraria, you're free to do what you want.And right when you think things are getting bland again, hardmode hits you. All of your weapons and armor's effectiveness is quartered. Enemies are a challenge again. Venturing out at night is a near death sentence. New enemies will spawn, and new loot along with it. But again, don't be discouraged. You'll die quite a bit, after all. Build your strength up again, and go kick some♥♥♥♥♥ "

												For those that say this game is merely minecraft 2D, allow me to explain how wrong you are.Yes, this shares some key components with minecraft, but it also has a flavor of its own that minecfraft will likely never have.tons of weapons, enemies, bosses, and player progression namely.this game isn't for builders.This game isn't for fighters.It's for the players that don't want to stick to one way of life, and enjoy a change of pace as time goes on.farm, build, fight, and enjoy yourself. if you can't get into this game, so be it. but i must say that this games well worth a second try.

												The most used comparison for this game is Terraria/Minecraft. I shall explain the difference between Minecraft and Terraria (edit: terraria is better)Exploration-Minecraft- 3D world, practically limitless, several biomes, intresting underground areas.Terraria- 2D world, you can control the size, several biomes, deeper underground areas. Underground hosts greater and cooler enemies, treasures, cave systems, etc.Building-Minecraft- Limited supply of blocks, blocks take up lots of space, the few interesting blocks are impossible to get easily.Terraria- Hundreds and hundreds of blocks, blocks stack into higher quantities (M=64, T=999), blocks are easier to get.Combat-Minecraft- 3 bosses, 5 swords, and a bow. 5 types of armor. Not much variety for pvp, it comes down to whoever has a stronger weapon.Terraria- 29 bosses, Swords ranging from shortswords to nyan-cat projectile swords, ranged weapons, magic, summoner weapons, etc. Pvp comes down to who has the most manuverability.So Terraria has more good points then bad, when compared to MInecraft. So there. Shut up about this game being a rip off, you Minecraft-F-N-A-F-fanboys-who-will-rise-to-protect-""the-best-games-of-all-time"".			"

Introduction:Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with elements of action, mystery and adventure set in a beautifully pixelated world of flying eyeballs and various biomes like hell. With the choice to build, mine, fish, explore, fight and ride unicorns, how you play the game is really up to you.Pros:-Customisable characters with cloud support. -Dozens of weapons, armour, equipment, tools and consumables to choose from.-Various mounts and pets to choose from.-Multiple biomes with their own unique inhabitants, resource and behaviour.-Over ten bosses that provide a challenge for combat lovers.-Interesting NPCs who appreciate your horrible houses.-More than one way to play the game (such as fishing, mining and dying).-Hundreds of craft-able items and dozens of blocks.Cons:-Very time-consuming (although some see this as a good thing).Overall:Terraria is not a rip-off of Minecraft, but is actually a phenomenal game packed  with fun and a lot of content. It is definitely worth its price and twice the fun when played with a friend. Even after beating the final boss, there are still lots to explore, discover and achieve in this wonderfully made game. I personally rate this game a 9/10. :)			"

Now that I played about 100 hours on record, I now know it isn't a clone of Minecraft, it is better than Minecraft in my opinion. Its a 2D adventure game, with alot of bosses and crafting. One thing I don't like about it, the Steam multiplayer. In most games, Steam allows you to play with other people using Steam, in Terraria you have to host your own server. At the end of the day, Terraria is a great game, and I recommend it.10/10			"

												Terraria is easily capable of providing hours of entertainment. My impression prior to buying it was that it was a 2D minecraft clone, but after playing it, I prefer it to minecraft. But comparing to minecraft, as is often done, doesn't seem very fair to me, because they are two very different experiences. Terraria can be played in many different ways, and I'd expect that most people can find a way to enjoy it. Whether you prefer to take it slowly and cautiously, farming herbs and brewing potions, or prefer to role the dice, diving through caves and looting randomly generated structures, Terraria can be about exploration, collection, boss fighting, base defending, and much more. You start out by creating a character. The customization is limited, but not too limited. You can have multiple characters, and you can skip this by randomizing or choosing the default skin, but it doesn't take very long. You can then create a world (or multiple), choosing between normal and expert mode (as its name suggests, expert mode is not forgiving to newer players). The world has many different regions to explore, each with their own dangers and treasures. Between islands in the sky, a bug-infested jungle, a terrifying evil (which begins to spread later, there are two variants), and much more, you probably won't be bored by it for some time.The game has many mechanics to make it interesting. You can start a town of NPCs and complete quests for them or buy goods from them. You can fish up a meal or some treasure. You can acquire tools which you can use to wire up traps or farms. There are many events the player can defend against of varying difficulties throughout the game, and even more bosses to fight. There are literally thousands of different items and accessories to customize your playstyle; although there are only four main classes to choose from for the majority of the game, these being mage, ranged weaponist, mele fighter, and summoner (although summoner items are usually more difficult to obtain).I personally have put in almost a thousand hours, but I don't believe you need to put in even ten hours to get your money's worth. If you're having any difficulties while playing, the game has a massively helpful wiki, and a friendly community.			"

												What is Terraria? Terraria was a game that, often mistaken as a ""Minecraft clone"" and often seen as ""2D Minecraft"". Even after all that nonsense, Terraria was still a unique and a very young 2D adventure game that dragged many players into its world. After 1.2 update, Terraria became even larger, selling millions of copies, but then just after 1.2.1, it began to slowly die off. Fans were crying for it... Not until something wonderful happened. Terraria was released on consoles, slightly extending its life, and then, there were rumors about a big update for Terraria on PC. The 1.3 update was litteraly an explosion of new content, and yes, its true, +1000 items were added into game. This has to be one of the largest updates ever made for one game in gaming history. Free updates are still coming, adding more and more content, together with bug fixing and tweaking to make game more enjoyable and fun.If isn't obvious by now, Terraria is much better than Minecraft in all aspects. Don't get me wrong, Minecraft and modding is a wonderful thing too, but Minecraft alone will be never as good as Terraria currently is. So, what does Terraira feature that makes it such a great game? Let's start from what you can do in Terraira:FIGHT!From smacking slimes with your copper sword you start with, to annihilating the most powerful creatures of universe, you will learn (in a hard way) how dangerous the lands of Terraira really are. You are nowhere safe, not even inside your own home, as during certain events, swarms of enemies will break into your house, attempting to turn you and your fellow NPCs into a pile of mangled corpses. Hell, even bosses will come after you to punish your cowardness (if you haven't defeated them yet). Even if you own a good equipment to fend off enemies, your world is still in danger. There are biomes, seen as ""evil"", that will spread out and eventually corrupt your entire world. You are only one who can prevent this, so you better get a move on!You will come across thousands of enemies, as well as thousands of weapons to use aganist them. There are so many weapons to choose from, that everytime you start from beggining, you will find different set of weapons and armor to use. This is what makes replayability in Terraria great. From weapons, you have: swords that are ten times larger than your character, swords that shoot swords, bow that makes arrows rain from sky, large variety of machineguns, launchers, pistols, laser weaponary, craziest magical items you'll ever see, lots and lots of ammo types, and much, much more... Once you got yourself a good gear, its time to challenge most powerful and badass bosses that you will have hard time defeating. Gain their loot, and progress deeper in world of Terraria, eventually unlocking the ""Hardmode"" in your world, where real adventure begins and where only real heroes (your characters) shall become champions of Terraria!BUILD!Hundreds and hundreds of blocks to choose from, Terraira offers greatest choice of decorations and blocks for all creative minds out there! Most of blocks have their own theme (e.g. Marble represents acient Greeks), as well as their own set of furniture, such as bathtubs, tables, bookshelfs, lamps, etc. Some require for you to own special crafting stations and tools in order to use them for building, meaning that you will need to explore and fight in order to earn those items. Once you got everything you need, its up to you what you want to build. A house made entirely out of bones? Slime? Glass? Honey? Or make it steampunk themed, alien themed, have golden toilets, garden full of large glowing mushrooms, color shitfting blocks, beds made out of flesh... I can go forever like this, the options, are truly endless! You can even shape blocks with hammers and/or color them, build traps with wiring system, wall tappets, decorations, paintings... Remember, you world... Is your canvas! You can get NPCs to live inside your marvelious creations, and they will sell you many things that you will find very useful.Oh, and also, you can craft single colored blocks with gems you find underground. These blocks are made for pixel art!EXPLORE!A small world of Terraira contains everything you need, but just imagine what large worlds offers. All you have to do is explore them! You will find large variety of awesome loot, accesories and weapons for your character to use, statues to collect, and most importantly, ores used for crafting and crystal hearts that extend your maximum health. But beware, as I said, nowhere is safe. Underground is full of deadly traps and mobs that you are probably too weak to fight aganist, as well as other hazards such as water that you can easily drown in and lava that incrinates everything that touches.If you have hard time exploring the underground, try fishing! With fishing, you a can get seriosuly good loot that can help you face the dangers of underground. All you need here is bait, good fishing rod, patience and with enough luck, you will be swinging fish-swords and shark-pickaxes at your foes!COLLECT!Collecting virtual pixel sprites was never been so fun. Being able to own everything that exists in Terraria is satifaction at its best! If you like collecting stuff, you will probably relate to struggles of having filled up inventory with statues and paintings, hurrying back to your spawn so you can see what traveling merchant has for sale and defeating one boss over and over again, just to get that one item that you don't own, only to leave it inside a chest and never use it again. Or a throphy to decorate your walls with. Ah, lovely!CUSTOMIZE!In order to customize your character in a way you really want, it needs a lot of effort. You will need to fight and explore a lot, as well as get NPCs to live with you so you can buy vanity items from them. Terraria also features ""social slots"". With these slots, you can wear both armor and vanity clothes without losing defense points that armor gives. In-case you find one armor likeable, but you don't want to wear it because you already own a better armor, just put it in social slot and you will look like you are wearing it, and your actual, better armor, will still provide you its perks and abilities. Social slots are made for cosmetic purposes. You can also use dyes to paint yourself and your vanity and armor in different colors, as well as using hair dyes for hair. There's an impressive amount of dye combinations that you can craft, as well as rare dyes that glow, have animations, reflect light and other kinds of wacky colors and effects.Should you buy this game? Why, of course! Its worth every single copper coin. And has multiplayer too, which makes plenty hours of fun if you have a buddy/buddies to play with. It has holiday events during halloween and christmass, where you can get rad loot if you play during those special events.I gurantee this game will bring you at least thousand hours of fun, as long as you prove yourself worthy and prevail over frustation and dangers that Terraria can offer. Well, will you?			"

												I remember.Started to play a bit more games than just CS:S and CS 1.6. My brother had found this new awesome game that could be a potential minecraft, but for slower pcs, and with a hell lot more content. Back in 2011, you had to hammer crystals. You had to use a wooden axe to cut wood blocks, not a pickaxe.  You couldn't get past a 1-block tile withouth jumping. Background was ugly, so was the sun. Rocket boots needed mana. Liquids were buggy, so were walls, there was no expert mode. The Twins were awfully hard, so was the destroyer. Star Cannon was OP. Making a bridge to fight WoF was tedious. I had pirated this game, i'll admit that, but even then, even with those annoying things, even with the sluggish gameplay it had, it was one of my best times of my childhood and the most fun i've ever had with a game, so beautiful seeing it develop like a great Indie Game deserves.Thank you Redigit. You've made my childhood brighter.			"

Terraria has revealed itself as a very complete game. The idea of a 2D minecraft has not pushed me into the game initially, but eventually I gave it a try to play in Co-op with friends, and in a reasonable amount of hours and I was very impressed with the ton of content that this game has.Gigantic maps to dig, events to do, tons of different mobs, great bosses, amazing content for crafting, NPCs, skills and abilities. Go to the sky, go to Hell. Start chopping some trees at the beggining, end up litterally flying with laser guns, ridding unicorns, being a werewolf, and so on. The game also has some boring times, a bunch of time spent on research to know what to do next, what to craft, where to go, but in the end it will be worth it. The game was a pleasant surprise to me.OVERALL 9.1/10Amazingly Co-op fun! "

												Probably best 2D sandbox ever made. The amount of items you can craft or get and enemies you can defeat (including bosses) is just sometimes overwhelming.The game has 2 stages :1) Pre-hardmode - basically a longer ""tutorial"" where you learn basics such as crafting, fighting monsters and exploring biomes, this stage ends when you kill certain boss in the underground called wall of flesh.2) Hardmode - the real game begins here, monsters are stronger and new biomes appear, a lot of game content unlocks only in this mode. This stage remains forever (or you can count defeating the last boss as a end of it).There are a lot of decorative items and furniture so builders won't be dissapointed though I was focused more on exploring and fighting rather than building.Highly recommend this game but be careful - its addictive :)			"

												I'm going to be honest, at first I hated this game. I mean, absolutely despised it. But believe me, when I started crafting better gear, fighting new mobs, and building my home, I became immersed in Terraria. There's an endless amount of content here for only $9.99 and if you were like me thinking this was just a 2D Minecraft rip-off, you couldn't be more wrong. Definitely a must play. (And yes, like always, the PC version is far superior of the console versions.)			"

												""2D Minecraft"" - It is a thought almost everyone has had (and anyone claiming otherwise are lying to themselves), but Terraria is much more than just that, and here is why I recommend it.Terraria's world is literally designed as a Terrarium, you start somewhere towards the middle of your world, and whether you go left or right - you will eventually stumble into an ""ocean"" with an invisible wall a little ways out. You have a couple options, build a base, and start exploring the surface, or you start mining and spelunking through the cave systems. Terraria's surface contains a little less than a dozen different biomes for you to explore and utilize as grounds for your home base (or outpost), and you will stumble into various enemies throughout them, and even sometimes fight the biome itself (Cure the corruption/crimson, or heck even help it spread!). Be sure to build shelter for the night as monsters are prone to hunt you down. Additionally there is also the chance of events happening, such as the goblin invasion.Throughout its underground system (which can be around 2000 blocks deep) you will find mini-dungeons, deep cavern systems and even bosses at times. And of course, we have a hell-ish biome at the very bottom filled with lava and demonic creatures.And when you think you have done it all? Defeat the boss in the hell-biome and start a NewGame+ esque event that makes everything in your world harder - even the bosses.So is Terraria recommended? Hell yes. For $10 (it's been on sale as low as $2 if you're on a budget) you will literally get days (or weeks!) worth of gameplay, and even more so if you have friends to play with! (Co-op always makes games better).			"

												Well I think it's about time to review this gem.Terraria is one of the best value-per-dollar games you can buy on steam. Period. Obviously some of the free-to-play games can match that value (because you spend nothing) but the amount of content in this game is just ridiculous!Ever since 1.0, there have been 3 absolutely game-changing updates, for completely free. The game was already worth it just at 1.0, apart from bugs, but then they litterally quadrupuled or quintupled every aspect of the game. 1.0 got the basics right; satisfying combat, fun exploration, lots of sandboxy things to do, but as I just said, it's sandboxy; there's a lack of an appropriate ending besides ""get the most powerful stuff."" 1.3 gave us the Moon Lord which is the equivilant of the Ender Dragon from Minecraft; it doesn't end your game after you defeat it but it's something tough even with the gear you get from him, so it feels like a climactic end.You'll start off small with your copper shortsword, or maybe you build the wooden broadsword to replace it. After many hours you'll have slowly went through the arsenal of weapons and armor the game provides you, from bows to guns to MAGIC, and from simple ""take less damage"" armor to armor that has really unique effects such as allowing you to reflect damage and draw aggro from enemies for your friends.On top of the weaponry you have all of the things to do with blockbuilding. There's so many pieces of furnature and different materials you can use to make something that looks amazing, and then you can customize it further by changing shapes with a hammer or recoloring blocks through the paint gun. On top of those cosmetic things you also have the (as of a recent update) fairly extensive wiring system that can allow you to create some pretty cool traps or other mechanisms such as spawning enemies or opening/closing doors.And on top of THAT you have the massive variety of enemies to fight, some of which will completely obliterate you and you'll enjoy every minute of it. All of the bosses have their unique elements and you'll definitely be surprised the first time a signature move comes out (like the first time that the Corruption boss comes out of the ground).AND ON TOP OF THAT you have a thriving modding community if the base game doesn't have enough content. Whether you just want more content or complete overhauls, the modding community's got you covered in user-friendly mod managers and easy mod installation.So basically I'm saying the game's pretty good and you should buy it if you haven't already with how often it goes on 50% and 75% sales.EDIT: Also you guys should totally nominate this game for the ""Test of Time"" reward because the game has always been great and it just keeps getting better and it's one of those games that pretty much every person on Steam has enjoyed at one point and returned to it at another when updates come out.

												You start the game and be like ""What am i even doing?"" so you dig and build and explore like it was Mincraft or something like that. Then, after you find a huge pile of junk and some hearts, you'll get a Message  ""You feel an evil presence watching you...,"" and your Pants might feel warm because you already know that Terraria loves to kill you. Boss spawns and you might die. Or you're able to kill him!After that you'll look at the Wiki and realize ""Holy mother of Slimes this game has content!""And THAT is where your jorney truly begins!Gear up! Fight Bosses! Gear up again! Fight more Bosses! Get killed! Try again! Build stuff! Survive Events! Die to random traps! Fight MOAR BOSSES! Dig to Hell and back! Get OP! Build on! Slay random stuff for your amusement! Farm stuff you don't even need anymore! Watch all your fellow NPCs get slain by the next Boss! Catch Fish! Catch a bigger Fish! Get killed by that bigger fish!

												Massive creative time sink. Dig like a boss.This is one of, if not THE best values on Steam for the amount of time you can play it vs. the money you will spend. Terraria has had two massive updates for free already, as well as both a Halloween and a Christmas update that added many more items, enemies, events, and bosses as well. The game caters to most gamers in that it has several ways to enjoy the game.Exploration, mining, and item collecting is a big part of the game. With the 2 major updates, and the two season ones the game has hundreds of items to find, get from bosses, and simply craft. For the item collectors out there you can spend a good 50-100 hours searching for all of these alone. You can find and craft armors, melee weapons, ranged weapons, and magic weapons. You will be able to find and craft dozens of accessories that can be improved and combined with others. You can plant gardens for potion ingretients, find special keys to unlock more chests, banners, paintings, statues, etc. for decoration. You can even craft dyes to allow you to change the color of your gear and paints to change the color of your blocks.Boss fights are for the more action orientated players. The game has 2 modes. You start in the normal, or ""easymode"" we all call it with just a handful of bosses that shouldn't be too difficult for you once you learn the mechanics and have upgraded your weapons, armors, and accessories. After defeating a certain boss in this mode the game will enter into HArdmode. This is where the more challenging enemies and bosses appear. You also will get access to much higher level gear and you will have much much more to find.The real longevity of the game, however comes in the crafting and building aspects of Terraria. AFter you have dominated all the bosses and mined all your ores, found your gears, etc. you can still spend hundreds of hours designing and building massive towns and structures. The game even has a bunch of wires and mechanical items that you can set up to do things such as teleport! The building aspect is most certainly my favorite part of the game.Not only can you do ALL of this alone in single player, but Terraria has CO-OP/Multiplayer! You can do everything you can in the single player mode, but with friends! Share and trade items with others, go and fight bosses together, or join together and create a massive art project, or city. Look around the net for Terraria artwork. There are truly some pehnomenal art designs by the Terraria players out there. Terraria is one of my favorite games I have on Steam and is one that every STeam gmaer should own. The game goes oon sale regularly at 75% off so you can get it for $2.50 regularly. It's a steal even at full price. Also, don't forget to check out Terraria Online for the wiki and the modding community. This game has a very nice and active mod community. So even after all of this you can still get mods too!The game also has trading cards.			"

												Terraria, Terraria, Terraria. Old old Terraria.I used to play this game with my sister and my friend on my server, it appears I played almost 140 (138) hours of this game and it was pretty darn good.Terraria is a sandbox sidescrolling indie RPG with a lot of crafting needing to be done but it is NOT a Minecraft copy in any stretch of the imagination, no no no. To some, it could even be better.Terraria features a huge amount of enemies, items and bosses all of which are incredibly designed. It also features funky 16 bit style music which is pretty awesome.First off and perhaps my favourite feature and the reason I love the game are the amounts of items, there are so many magical items almost all doing something unique and different such as a harp which sends out musical notes to attack your enemies or a wand which shoots out a beam which you control with your mouse. Let's just say the designers are very creative fellows indeed. Next off and my second favourite thing are the incredible amounts of bosses! From a giant worm to Cthulu's old eye, there is no limit to the amount of randomness and awesomeness you can find in this game.However, Terraria still has it's flaws. And one flaw is very big and slightly game ruining to me and why I don't play anymore.There is a large amount of grinding involved. Certain enemies drop certain items (Skeletons and Piranhas used to/still do drop hooks, but only Skeletons and Piranhas) and some have very low drop rates. Again, this might have been fixed. However, that was merely one floor amongst many positives.Back to the positives: One thing I forgot to mention was the housing system. Whenever you make a compatible house (You can't just make a random crevasse and expect it to work, you need to create a proper actual house) an NPC will move in, but only after you complete the achievement which will earn the NPCs respect, such as kill a boss which I think you needed for the Dryad. There are many, many NPCs for you to get and they all sell different things and say funny things, especially the Nurse who seems to have a crush on the Gunslinger, but again nothing is done with that. Don't expect cute Guide X Dryad crap to happen, sorry shippers. That'd be cool, if couples could actually happen or you could spy on the conversations between two or more NPC's. There is a huge amount of enemies to battle from flying eyes to unicorns, they're all unique and it'll take you a lot of hours to get bored and want new enemies, and not to mention the amount of hours you can put into this game is INSANE. It'll take estimated 200 hours and over (Don't quote me on that) to see every little tiny bit of content, if not 300 hours. But once you're done with that I'm not sure if you'd want to come back to it.And finally... The combat system. It's very basic, especially melee wise. But once you get late into the game you'll find all kinds of unique swords and magic items that'll mix everything up.And the final verdict for Terraria is... 6.5 out of 10. I feel bad for not ranking it higher, but the grinding (and the fact that it's not really my kind of game altogether) causes it to be a 6.5/10, which is a 'great game!' to me. Until next review :) Bye!			"

												ALRIGHT, SERIOUS REVIEW HERE:If you are looking for an addicting, time consuming (oops, those meant the same thing kinda) and amazing game, then you have come to the right place. To have an honest review here, Terraria is pretty boring when you first play it. Right? I'm sure everyone would agree with that one. BUT, as you play it more, it starts to get more addicting to you because you realize the wide variety of opportunities you can do inside the game. MEANING, you can do things like spawn more than 1 boss and fight them all at the same time, (The bosses are pretty beast btw) you can get a lot more loot (Swords, spears, yo-yo's, summoners, magic, guns!?) and even build really nice buildings to show off! You can also change the color of your character with different dyes for your armor. The dyes aren't just normal colors though, most of them have very unique mixtures that can make your armor look VERY impressive (around 30 unique and exclusive dyes, not just generic plain colors.) I myself have spent the first 2 weeks on this game ONLY. (Fitting in about...100 hours those weeks) so it's pretty obvious that to ME it was such an amazing game, with so much amazing loot and bosses. And there's a lot more where that came from. The game also has an excellent soundtrack, the music gets even better the farther you get in the game.  Anyway, thanks for reading the review, hopefully maybe I changed your mind about the game, (If I didn't it's completely fine.) but I strongly recommend it. Just remember, you will not regret buying this game if you AT LEAST make it into hardmode. Honest Rating: 9.5/10			"

												After putting hundreds and hundreds of hours into this game, A review:The basic game has been developed a lot through it's lifetime, and is very solid. There are a few overpowered things here and there (such as the very early obtained gem grappling hooks with massive range) but it's a very solid balance over all. Lots of objects you will find will already be useless because you've found better, but each time you play through the game, who knows, you might just happen upon an item earlier than usual. What you'll want to play this game for is the multiplayer. Playing alone is all well and good, but playing with friends, building projects with them, that's what can't be beaten. The bosses are incredibly difficult to beat alone anyway, so it'll make your life a lot easier to work with others. I seem to always manage to get a lot more hours from this game every time someone new decides they'll play it with me.Finally, a suggestion. 1. Get this game. 2. Play on a LARGE world. Small worlds run out of space to explore quickly, and it'll mean anything you build isn't kept, because when you finish exploring a world, you'll want to go to another.  Sky islands will be more difficult to find, and you'll have to build outposts close to the dungeon and the jungle so you don't keep having to run from your original spawn, but it's worth it. It'll also mean the corruption won't spread over your house as quickly once you get into hardmode.			"

Product received for free
												Alright, this game is probably one of the best games that i have ever played. At first, when my friend was talking about a 2D game that was kinda like minecraft where you could build whatever you wanted and fight monsters at night, i was thinking that you might aswell go play minecraft. But my friend constantly bugged me saying that this is a must play game. After about 2 months of harrasment a sale happend that brought this game down to two bucks.          Once that happend within 30 seconds of the sale my friend had bought a copy of the game for me. As you can see from the amount of hours i have on this game it wasn't for nothing. We have ""beaten"" the game about 5 times, first on softcore easy world (at this point there wasn't any hard world option) then we tried to only stick two one class throught a whole playthrough getting to the end (at this point the end was Duke Fishron) after a couple months of not playing the game we came back and found that there was a massive update to the game and a Boss called the Moonlord was a thing. At this point there wasn't any knowlage of the moonlord, like how to spawn him, how hard he is, what he drops. We kept it a mystery until we would eventually kill him ourselves.          We started an easy world with softcore characters and started on a journey that brought back memories. Once we had killed the Eye of Cthulu, and as usual my friend and i fought over who got the loot from him, we had heard some talk about a new game mode called Hardmode. So we packed up all our stuff and moved onto a hardmode world. Now that slimes could basically two hit us♥♥♥♥♥♥started to get heated. With multiple cases of raging to trying to get our money that we had lost back, to basically anything that wasnt planned jumping right on our asses. After a very long month or so of playing about 5 times a week we had seen these wierd looking ""Cultists"" at our doungeon. Seeing as we don't like people just taking over them we tried to kill them, thus resulting on an epic battle of things flying everywhere and the lead cultist splitting into aobut 20 different holograms of himself we realized that this fright wasn't even a challenge. Once he was dead a weird looking orange sun poped up in the background, it took about five seconds of us admiring the ""moon set"" until a massive fire worm came and one shot both of us. After many trial and errors trying to defeat the different colours that we still didn't understand we had killed the last pillar that led to the fastest death you could imagine.           Now that the last pillar had been taken down, we set our in search of the one thing that would spawn the moon lord that we had been hearing so much about. Once we saw the words on our screen and seeing it getting all fuzzy we were wondering what was going on until we saw a massive moon looking man come and one shot both of us with a huge lazer that decimated everything that it touched. After all that time and enerygy we realized that we could craft some pretty decent stuff from the little sould that the pillars dropped. Now equipping some of the best gear in the game we had rtied about 4 more times with the pillars and finally defeated the moon lord. Once all of that was done we had taked a much longer break. Now we have stared to play again and this time we are playing medium core characters.          Just some advice, if you have even made it this far in my journey of Terraria, dont try and play a medium core for your first character. you will not play this game again. ill try and finish the mediumcore play through and then maybe evern a hardcore one. (if its at all possible)     The story of Primordial  ^-^			"

												Nice sandbox, nice survival game- You'll always have something to do here- The game is huge if you like to get all the achievements, kill all the bosses and play all the classes. - Awesome multiplayer game- Kind of hard at the beginning because everything is hard to get and everyone can kill you easily but it's worth- You can ""share"" your singleplayer worlds and it's amazing. - You can play with all your characters in all your worlds so it's nice because if you get something cool for another character can just let it in a chest, switch characters and get it. :D Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												This is my most played game on Steam...about 303 hours at the time of this posting. And the first game I ever bought on this platform. That was about 2 years ago.While it might be tempting to dismiss Terraria as a simple 2D Minecraft knockoff, its heavy focus on sidescrolling combat, boss fights, and crazy weaponry reveals just as large a debt to classics like Metroid and Castlevania. It clearly rests on the shoulders of giants, but is this enough to render Terraria a satisfying experience in its own right?As with Minecraft, you start your adventure by exploring a randomly generated landscape where you gather resources and build shelters in order to protect yourself from the hostile creatures that come out at night. Don't expect much in the way of a tutorial--while you can pick up some random tips from an NPC that follows you around, you're essentially left to figure out how to play the game on your own. Once you do, however, you'll find that you can build fortresses and craft weapons and other items with ease, and you'll even attract helpful NPCs such as merchants and nurses if you build homes for them.Yet Terraria is less about assembling monumental structures and more about crafting gear and fighting monsters. And the monsters are everywhere. During the day, you'll be hounded by lightweight slimes whose persistence makes building even the simplest structures a challenge, and during the night, you'll have to endure hordes of relentless zombies and floating eyeballs that batter your fortress.But the real challenges lie deep below in the underworld, where you'll dig tunnels to battle giant worms, skeletons and other horrors that drop the rare materials needed for the best upgrades. Gather enough materials, and you'll be able to craft a surprisingly eclectic arsenal that includes grappling hooks, lightsabers, and boomerangs--all of which will come in handy when summoning and battling the game's bosses. And if you find that it's a little too dangerous to go alone, you can always play with your friends in multiplayer.In the end, Terraria presents an experience similar to Minecraft, but it manages to distinguish itself with a heavy dose of breakneck fun that Minecraft often lacks. There's something for everyone here, and a host of free updates, a polished retro presentation, and a reasonable $10 price tag make this sandbox more than worth digging into.Highly Recommended "

												I love this game! What I love about it is that it is fairly easy and low-key when you first start, so you can learn how to play the game and find stuff without being overwelmed, but is still challenging. I played this game with a friend and he gave me a basic rundown of what you do in the game, but if you come into the game completely new, it can be confusing to know what you are actually suppose to do. You have to explore your world to gain any stuff, and as you gain more stuff you also risk finding bad creatures and eventually a boss. As your character gets stronger the game gets harder, but it still never feels impossible to complete. I also like that you can play this game over and over and still find new things to do, it never really feels completed to me. I have over 400 hrs in this game and I still haven't completed Duke Fishtron or Moon Lord on hardmode. I really like building towns and castles, you can make farms and machines, completely explore your map, dig tunnels and elevators to get around quickly, and you can build battle towers and test them by summoning events like the Blood/Frost/Pumpkin moon. Once you have your character built up as much as you can you can also do hardmode and expert, both are very challenging and fun. It is kind of funny how quickly you defeat the low level bosses like the Eye of Cthulhu once you are really strong. If you have a really powerful summoner active, sometimes they can kill the small bosses before they even appear in your field of vision.You can play with/against friends too, but getting the game actually set up and able to play multi-player is kind of a hastle, but once you have it figured out is is a lot of fun. The game also has a cheeky sense of sarcasim and adult humor that never gets old.Overall I love the game, it is easily one of my favorites!			"

												I have been playing Terraria ever since 2013 or so, and I honestly love it. The game has improved ever since it has started, and what was first a so-called ""2D Minecraft Rip-Off"" has become a fantastic game. Here are some pros and cons:ProsA ton of weapons, armor, and accessories that all have fun ways to useImproved multiplayer (If you have played the game as long as me, you know what I mean)A variety of NPCs to help you advance through the gameAmazing designs for... pretty much everythingBosses that are always fun to defeat with your friends or even by yourselfAn extremely active community of other playersAchievements that are fun to getConsWithout the use of the internet, the game can be extremely confusing for beginnersYounger players will have a hard time spelling the actual name of the gameUpdates take a long time to put into the game, so if there is a bug in the game it will take a while to fixThe game has been hacked by annoying players countless timesSo, overall, I would give this game a 9/10. This game is well worth buying, even if it is a little expensive.			"

												10/10. One of my favorite games. Its fun to play on your own, however, i would recommend having a music playlist playing in the background while you play on your own. Its also very easy to play with friends through steam. Also the game isn't very expensive, definitely worth the $10, especially if you have friends to play it with. However, only downside is that it can become a little repetitive over time. But after all, i guess that can be said for a lot of games. Sometimes its good to take a break for a little bit and come back to it.I currently have 434 hours played on this game, all but 6 achievements, and have beat every boss (that has been currently added). Theres a lot you can do in this game to keep yourself entertained.			"

 Pros:  Beautiful/stellar music, esp The Hallowed and Space Charming graphics/very colourful (makes you sit in awe of the world) Patch 1.3 added 800+ new items Good item tier and crafting system Allows for a lot of creativity High replay value 3 map size settings/huge top to bottom maps Variety of biomes Imaginative bosses (14-16 in total), invasions, and special events, e.g. Halloween and Christmas (which you can get early on if you manually alter your computer's time and date) Developers are a decent bunch of ducks, so support this [great] game! Welcoming community  Now supports Steam servers  Cons:  Starting game can be somewhat slow Several achievements are bugged, e.g. heart breaker in multiplayer. May require a new world after a patch to recognise the achievements properly Switching between items [1-0] can be infuriating and often unresponsive Previous versions won't work well on newer patches, e.g. 1.2 worlds won't respond well to a 1.3 patch There's a lot of information to remember in this game, so you may have to refer to the Wiki a lot (can be - depending on the person) Conclusion: I would definitely recommend this game, especially considering the £/$ per enjoyable hour model. It's also a game you can come back to over and over again, and one that's truly timeless, and can be played by all kinds of gamers. Related games:  Starbound Minecraft "

												If you think its just a clone of MINECRAFT, then something is very wrong with you, and you clearly haven't played it. (in MC you throw ender eyes as a sense of direction to dungeon to get to the end, Terraria you did to hell).It is strongly based on adventure instead of just digging a hole in the ground. Think of it more as an adventure RPG than a digging game.Has many references to other things (such as Legend of Zelda, Mario, Tobuscus, and more).EXTREMELY fun with a friend or multiple.Would recomend twice.

												The main thing you should know about this game is soundtrack 12/10,  its so amazing, even when you will be full of this game you still will play it because of soundtrack :D. By the way, don't be too mean and buy it(about 3-4$)Music is beautiful and changes depending on which biome/area we are in. Yeah! it has lots of music :)Lets go to the point body :It is a wide-open sandbox style game; we can edit the terrain and go anywhere we want to.The game starts in a randomly computer generated world. We start with three basic tools: a pickaxe for mining, a shortsword for combat, and an axe for woodcutting. Many resources, notably ores, can be found while mining or exploring underground caves. The player starts off with 100 health, which can eventually be increased up to 500 by finding special items (life hearts and fruit ones)underground. Some resources and most items may only be found in certain areas of the map, stored in common and rare containers, or dropped by certain enemies. The player uses resources to craft new items and equipment at an appropriate crafting station for that recipe. For example, tables or other items can be crafted at a work bench and bars can be smelted from ore at a furnace. Several advanced items in Terraria require multiple crafting operations where the product of one recipe is used as the ingredient for another.You can encounter many different enemies in Terraria such as simple slimes, zombies, demon eyes, and various region-specific enemies. The occurrence of certain enemies depends on several factors including time, location, random events, and player interactions. We can fight against enemies with swords, bows, guns, magic spells, and other weapons. Each map will have several zones with unique items and unusual enemies.To sum everything up: gameplay and musical design is so great. You will be an idiot if u had some money to spend and and didn't buy it.50/10 worth playing.			"

												10/10 one of the best games ever. it has nearly no limits, you can do nearly everything in it. building, fighting, fishing, exploring, digging , collect stuff (for ppl who like to collect every in game item) make pvp fights (or play pvp games like capture the gem) the only thing some ppl may not like is that terraria is 2d , i personaly like it but some people need it 3d to build stuff. and to everyone who calls terraria a 2d minecraft: PLS DON'T EVER say terraria is a 2d minecraft,  terraria is way more focused on the crafting and fighting. you have different classes, tons of items more. and grind... ofc you have to farm for your stuff. thats the main aspect of the game TO GO DIGGING UNDERGROUND, exploring finding stuff and mining your ores. and if you had the strong stuff in a few minutes then you would complain that you are to fast done with everything lol. notice terraria OFFERS you that you build alot stuff and that♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the main aspect is the mining and grinding for items in this game. the only thing minecraft has over terraria is that mc is 3d. if you just want to build stuff in 3d play minecraft. but thats the only thing mc has. mc is extremly limited and has way less items then terraria and even if terraria is 2d you can still build tons of awesome stuff			"

 Price For only 10 USD, this game provides a ton of content that is well worth more than the price of 10 USD Specs./PC Requirements Requires very minimal power until you have to defeat the final boss.I personnay run this on 45 fps and I have defeated the final boss Content It has the basic priniples of Minecraft, gather resources, survive, and defeat the bosses, but Terraria has something that makes it a very well known title. Terraria has thousands of accessories, has a crap ton of armor to choose from and a very wide variety of resources you can use for various uses. Don't like singleplayer? Well, you don't have to be alone. This game offers multiplayers so you can have friends join in and do whatever you want. From mods and glitches that can't get you Vac'd, I don't see why you don't have this game.Updates are rare but are big ones if they are released. The community has a great positive mood, I personally haven't experienced any trolls and negative players. Conclusion Just buy the game and be creative!			"

												Terraria Is really one of the best games I’ve played, Some people might thinks it’s a waste of time, But if you think about it, every game is a waste of time- But let’s not get into that. Its starts of really slow, but after a while its gets quite fun. And the graphics? Oh com'mon dont be so subbern to the point of judging a game by its graphics.But let’s actually talk about the game. Some people think that this game is a knock off of Minecraft, but its totally different. They may have some similarities but Terraria is more of a RPG. More bosses,   Weapons, Ores. I really loved this game; I would defiantly put this in my top 10 favorite games.Oh and the music, I ABSOULUTALY LOVE the music. Different themes for different biomes, And even a theme music  for that biome underground. Kudos for whoever made the soundtracks. The music play every second of the game, so I really like that.You don’t think you can make a good house in a 2d game? Wrong. Therese tons- TONS of decretive blocks for building. You can actually get trophies and banners from killing bosses & mobs. I’d suggest this to creative & survivor gamers.			"

												Terraria is a legend. It's a 2D crafting/survival game with simple graphics, thousands of craftables and tons of bosses (26 on PC, to be precise) to beat.You want a challenge? You come at the right place - to beat certain opponents you need skill... or wide knowledge and very very long stage preparations ^^'You seek fun? There is a multiplayer and lots of ways to have fun and/or prank your friends ;)And if you like building - you're NEVER going to get bored ^^ Build your very own Floating Gardens, underground dungeon(s) or any type of functional electronic circuit. In 1.3.1 patch they added logic gates, sensors and lots of tools to help you with wiring.There are 3 types of character-based difficulity and 2 types of world-based difficulity. You beat every boss? Nice! Now try it on Expert Mode world - and don't get surprised :DAlso, after defeating certain boss, world enters Hardmode. Difficulity spike is real ^^Sometimes to spice things up an event occurs - during which event-only enemies swarm you in hordes :)Of course, there are bugs. Sometimes randomly generated world is unintentionally difficult (especially for newly creater characters). But... that's about it. Other type of issues are extremely rare (I didn't encouter any in 200+ hours of gameplay) ^^			"

""The best 2D sandbox game out there. Like minecraft as a sidescroller""In this amazing sandbox game you will loose several hours. It's always fun, when you dig through caves, build houses for NPCs or farm some raw materials like mushrooms, wood and plants. There are neverending possibilities to combine items, ores and materials. That keeps it everytime interesting. It's a sidescroller but that doesn't mean, it's not exciting. Survive the night with walking zombies and flying demon eyes. Fight enemies and deny traps and use them for yourself. Be ready for well prepared dungeons. Fight incredible bosses and goblin armies. Dig down through hell or build up the eiffeltower with stonebricks. At least there is the hardmode which opens another bunch of items and possibilities. It's too much to discover, so that there is even a wiki out there: http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_WikiThe game is fully worth its price. If you play with your friends together in the same world the fun is more than doubled.Update: The new 88 achievements in the 1.3 version make it even more challenging to tryout the hardmode and rise up the complete  techtree. A new boss has been added: the Moon Lord.Just grinding were those fishing achievements ...			"

 Terratastic! I have been playing this since the very first release, keeping up with the updates and I must mention, the developers are really passionate about their game and have updated it always with loads and loads of content. I've never had so much fun in a sandbox. It has so many hours of exploration, that it's the best experience ever. Gameplay You start off with your guide in a fully unexplored land, ready to be plundered off it's resources. The guide explains few basics of the game and gives few tips that can help you out but he can also be a gentleman and open the door to your house to fellow zombies, because, let's not be rude to the guests shall we and let them have a fair meal of brains.In Terraria, exploration is the key. Chests and a multitude of other nice loot lay down underneath the layers of dirt and stone, which is completely wonderful. But not only that... the most amazing feature... POTS. YOU CAN SMASH POTS. The dream of smashing all the pots in your way has come true, they come in all variations! Pots, so many pots to break! But not only that- they hold rope, coins and more, something else really nice. Rope is useful when exploring caves at the very beginning, since you don't have a grappling hook of any sort and the wood platforms and others just don't do it. Rope is your ally. Then comes the most important objective- mining of the ores. You'll need them to start crafting better gear for a better protection and damage, so you don't get destroyed by powerful creatures and advance to the corruption where you'll have even more business to attend there. It's up to you to explore, Terrarian! Graphics Another feable comparrison to Minecraft is the pixelated art style. However, I have to disagree. Minecraft's visual aesthetics are based upon blocks just like Terraria. Though, Terraria has a lot more dynamic designs and aesthetics, and a much more vast colour pallet to boot. The art style is simple, yet very eye catching and has its own identity. Most sprite games try to base their style on games like Mega Man or Mario. Terarria, however, has its own style that is unique to itself. When you see the art and sprites, you don't think Mega Man or Mario. You think Terarria. Terarria also boosts a lot more visually stunning and diverse environments. The world also seems just so much more alive. Since this game is a sidescroller, the designers don't have to worry about Z axis. Because of this, Terarria has a lot more intricate world and level design and is a lot more vertical than its Mojang-created counterpart. Terarria also features a lot more enemies and NPCs than Minecraft. This game just feels alive and there's always something interesting on the screen, whether you're in the forests or deep underground. This game is just a joy to the eyes. OST & SFX Professionally done sound effects so you can get the most out of your gameplay, and awesome chiptune tracks to keep you going with the mood! Absolutely love the tunes and I look forward to buying the official soundtrack, it's that awesome! The rain and snow biome tracks are the best in my opinion, check both of them out on YouTube.Terraria OST RainTerraria OST Snow Should you buy it? Yes, you so should buy it! It's worth the full price for all the content it has to offer and fact is- it will offer even more on the plate soon enough.

												If a boulder falls on top of you, you die, and if you try to run from it, it chases you and you still die. If you fall into lava, you die. If you drop a voodoo doll into the lava, by complete accident....you. are. screwed.  If you're mining sand, and it starts falling on you, you suffocate. If you're looking for hearts in the underground to max out your life, you'll get stuck in a cobweb, and a dart trap will kill you. So you go back, and you see a gold chest. Right as you are about to loot it, you forget to look up and a boulder smashes you. If you forget to bring glowsticks and are stuck underwater, you won't be able to breathe and you'll drown. If you're just exploring the world from left to right, you suddenly realize that everything turns red. You keep going, only to be surrounded by a barrage of face monsters, crimeas, and blood crawlers. You only have 10 defense and a copper broadsword to defend yourself, and you realize that you are a prick. If you're building a massive building or trying to get to a floating island, you see a wyvern. It kills you, or it knocks you back and you end up where you started at ground level. In a tombstone.Eye of Cthulthu will come out of nowhere, and kill you when night falls. You'll learn to love Terraria. You will. 60-65 hours was when I finally started to know the in and outs of the game, and up to then, it was just a constant frustrating experience of dying. But that is part of the experience and now, it is one of my all time favorite games. This 2D RPG, sandbox adventure game is a must have for anyone who enjoys exploring, creating, destroying, and killing things. It may be a slight challenge in the beginning, but basically anything that you want to obtain in the game, involves mining or exploring. The more you mine, the deeper you go.The deeper you go, the more unique resources you obtain.The more unique resources you obtain, the more successful you become in the game. Mine, mine, mine. Some tips for beginners! Having auto-pause on helps sometimes.Mine, mine, mine.Start out small, and work your way up. Trees need grass.Mine, mine, mine.			"

												If you're a fan of adventure platforms like Metriod and Castlevania, but you always felt they could be a little more sandbox, Terraria is a must have.Though on the surface it looks like just another ""me too"" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying.You stick your nose under your first sod and there you are – in another world. Terraria is not much of a Minecraft 2D rip-off, it's an addictive pursuit of perfection that entertains; even though it stinks of a sweat from the adits.Terraria is a game, where you've got to make most of the fun yourself - a giant world to explore, tons of craftable items and currently three challenging bosses make this an easy task though. You'll find all materials really quick and every new item as well as every found crate or new area make you want to explore more of this lovely 8bit universe.The magical world of Terraria is bursting with terrific content and surprises to keep you invested for a long time.

 Terraria, A game about you, trying to survive the world of? Terraria, build and fight your way up to the end, you just start off as a person, only carrying nothing but the basic tools, and there you are. Deciding what your first step will be, will you go collect wood? Or immediately dive into the horrors below! It's all your choice in terraria.  There's a lot to do. What will be your first step? What will you do to become the Lord of Terraria? Well, the distance between  you and that tittle, is... let's say, pretty big, you got lots of things to do before you're done, and that is what keeps you playing.   Amazing gameplay. This is not just your average game, you got to use tactics, in fact, this game and its playstyle will keep building up. Though it can be frustrating sometimes, but aren't a lot of games like that? Hours and hours of never ending exploration. Oh? You're done finding what you wanted? There's always something else, waiting to be obtained. Maybe it's a rare drop? Maybe it's just an easy-to-get item that you badly want. However, you're never done trying to find whatever your heart desires.  Amazing boss fights.   Now, how can you be the 'Lord of Terraria' without proving it? You can't. That's why there are these strong foes that will challange you, all you have to do is defeat them. Sounds simple you may think? Well, it gets harder, but when it does, you'll find much better weapons and accessories. Some of these bosses are pretty challenging and require a good strategy.   Wonderful soundtracks. Not only is the environment of this game beautiful, but the soundtracks just finish it off. You're in a nice green forest, and what is the first thing you want to hear? Something peaceful. The soundtracks have all, their own special message, rather you're fighting a boss, exploring the caves or just wandering around at night. They all have their way of saying: ""This is where you are."" Challenging dungeons and caves.  If exploring the surface became boring, and you got bored? Then digging your way underground will have you exploring a lot longer! Mining these precious ores to craft materials or maybe some armor and weaponry to protect yourself. But, are you able to survive what's waiting for you down here?  Awesome weapons and items.  In this game, you have to be able to defend yourself. But how? With weapons of course! Do you like to slash your opponents with a mighty sword? Then crafting a good sword is the first step! Oh? You prefer to stay a safe distance away from your opponent? Well, that is possible! A bit later in the game you can own yourself a gun! But? What if you love to use magic? Is that even in the game? Well, it is! Either you can be a mage or a summoner! Wait, what's the difference you ask? Well, a Mage uses magic to fight and defend himself, a summoner on the other hand, summons creatures that will fight for him. However, magic items aren't quickly obtainable when you first start. But the time will come won't it?   An epic final boss.  Finally! You've defeated every boss! But... what is that? You feel a strong presence around you, as the final battle is about to come... you know... that you are not finished yet, for yet, to become to Lord of Terraria, you have to defeat the one who is... and that... is.......Something you'll find out on your own, spoiling it now would be rather pointless now wouldn't it? But what I can tell is, the items that this Lord will drop are very strong, and with these items, you can call yourself, The Lord of Terraria! Now, that was it. I hope you liked my little story.Personally, I just love this game. And I highly recommend it for those who love exploration and survival games. I hope this helped you a bit to see what Terraria is about and what it has to offer. Until then, I hope you'll have a good time playing and becoming, The Lord of Terraria! Have fun!			"

Personal Rating : ""Worth every seconds played""Traditional Rating : 9.5/10At the first glance, who will give a look for 2D sidescrolling with pixelized graphics, right?Terraria answer that doubtness with perfect gameplay and mechanic.I always try to explain this game to others as simple as this;""It's like Minecraft, but it's 2D, but it have the one that minecraft lack, goals for playing itself. Terraria have the RPG feel on it, there's character progression, bosses & challangeing enemies,  and the most important things-that minecraft said to be building & crafting game-; terraria give you thousands of crafting possibilities, no lie.""The achievements are well made (since 1.3.0.1), and it marks your progression through the game.Some rare items are almost impossible to obtain, but it's worth it when you finally get it.Multiplayers works flawlessly through Steam Integration, and you can even play with your friends that use ""pirated copy"" via IP connection.Thousands of dedicated server around the worldThousands mod you can try, if you still can't get enough with the vanilla ver.Developer are continuosly hearing, take ideas & critics from players, made this game is player-built-game, figuratively every things inside the game come from every corners of any Terraria forums.TL;DRThis game will feed your 300hours of loneliness for not having a GF, careful of addiction lad!

												Can't believe I haven't made a review till now.Before achievements, I couldn't get into the game. I just felt bored right off the bat with no clear goal of what to do next. I barely played it back then.After achievements, I was getting into the grove of things. Face boss after boss, victory after every defeat, and discovered a lot of new things I never noticed or came across before. Granted there was a massive update when they added in the achievements.I find it more fun than Minecraft as it gives you challengs to do when you explore and the difficulty rises the more you go, while Minecraft there's not much to do after awhile but build creative things. Minecraft is more for multiplayer while Terraria is good for both Single and Multiplayer. (I'm talking about vanilla).One down side is that you can sorta cheat your way with some of the bosses using the game mechancis to your advantage, but can be viewed as strategy for a few bosses. Another is when you're building something and an event starts by chance, you have to defend yourself or shelter away till it's over. You never know when they'll happen, just know how long it'll take. Sometimes events will happen one after another (blood moon and solar eclipse for example).The soundtrack is okay, but after awhile you'll just want to have it off throughout... it just feels a bit out of place to me and I don't know why.There are adventure maps you can download and play from the terraria forums (outside of steam) if you want to try something new or see what other people have made.Good luck doing 200 fishing quests. That'll most likely be your last achievement to get.			"

												Words can’t describe how fun this game is. It just becomes more enjoyable each hour... and with each boss killed. Even if you finish the game multiple times, I’m sure anyone would still find something new to do. The first few hours may be boring (I think it’s boring, personally) but after some time you realize how great it is. The developers did a great job on keeping the game alive with new content every few months. It really does have a lot of content and they are now working on Terraria: Otherworld.   If you have friends to play with it’s even more fun. Also you can speed up the progress by playing with them, which is always good. The 1.1, 1.2 and the 1.3 updates were the biggest updates to the game. If you played the game before ATLEAST the 1.3 update, you know how much content they add to the game. Even if you started playing the game after the 1.3 release, you will notice the huge amount of content.   I had lots of fun playing this game and the hours put into it was well worth it. I might not play it ever again but since I have lots of other games to play I just don’t have time for it.  At the end, it’s great and I’m SURE 90% of the people on steam has this masterpiece in their library. If you don’t own it, what are you waiting for?!

												This is, literally, the best use of 10 of your dollars that has ever, or will ever, present itself to you.This game should not be compared to Minecraft, as that game (and all games) = soggy, undercooked ravioli compared to this masterful work. In fact, Lamborghinis, stuffed-crust pizza, making love to Emma Watson, eating ice cream while sky-diving, and sharks riding jet-ski's are all garbage compared to this game. Leonardo Da Vinci, Abraham Lincoln, and Bill Murray once fused together, Dragon Ball Z style, and the mighty black hole of sheer awesomeness that was created from this fusion, had to stop, and bow down, humbled by the majesty of Terraria. Do yourself a favor: don't wait until a sale to pick this one up, as the devs really do deserve not only the $10 that this game costs, but also the extra hundreds of dollars that you will inevitably take from your or your child's college fund and send them when you realize they have created the closest thing we mere humans can get to digitized perfection.

												I built a suspiciously phallic base as a joke. The NPCs decided it was a good place to live, and I extended it into a suspiciously phallic hotel. A very successful suspiciously phallic hotel, at that. If you can't tell already, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and if you don't agree, you suck.Seriously though. Terraria is one of the best games that I've ever played, and for ten dollars, it's impossible to go wrong. Buy it, learn the ropes and then play with some friends. You will not regret it, especially if you like creating things and/or looting everything in sight/stealing from your friends/destroying hordes of enemies/spelunking around caves/pulling invasive weeds that want to kill you/exploring.(Please do not let the sidescrolling element deter you. In my opinion, it's what makes this game great. Imagine mixing Super Mario and Metroid together to bake a cake, and then adding Minecraft on top as the icing. Delicious.)			"

												For anybody thinking that it is a Minecraft copy, you are absolutely wrong. This game is much better than Minecraft and is completely different. Also, before you play 5 minutes and give up because you do not know what you are doing, look at some of the guides on steam and look at some youtube videos to familiarize yourself with the game and the mechanics of how it works.

Buy this game.Don't wait for a sale or for it to go down in price. It is by far the single best game I have bought for $10.The 2D pixel graphics are beautiful, the shadows and lighting are excellent. The sounds and music tracks go together very well and provide a rich atmosphere. The game play allows for both pure sandbox play and “questing”. Combat is self explanatory, there's very little learning curve in using weapons and items, though mastering their use may take some time. The materials in the game have a clear path down a wide tech tree, and the questing progress leads you through progressively more advanced mobs which are surprisingly well balanced, in my opinion.The total “questing” game play can last as little as 8 hours if you're rushing (and good), but more often will take closer to 40 or so for a newer player. Add in time you'll spend customizing your houses and world and you can easily get lost in a single world for litterally weeks (hundreds of hours).The only negative I can see is that the game does get a bit grindy at times, but if your like me, you can easily get lost in the grind as you test out new weapons and ammos on the various foes.A final word, if you liked Minecraft or Starbound you will, in all likelihood, like this title as well. There are enough common elements to all three titles to leave me confident enough to say this. However, I must stress, Terraria is not just 2D Minecraft, or just Starbound re-skined. It is a world of it's own, with it's own unique quarks and rules. In fact, I can see someone likeing, even loving Terraria and hating both Minecraft and Starbound. On a personal note, as much as I love Minecraft and Starbound, I would rank Terraria just above both in terms of polish and overall game play. The fact that the developer is still releasing updates for this fantastic title has made me a fan of not only the game but the company as well.OverviewPros:Excellent 2D GraphicsCompelling Game PlayClear Progression PathWell Priced (i.e. Cheap for what it Offers)Cons:Can Get Grindy at Times "

												Probably one of the first sandbox-crafting-building games, that made me skip sleeping at night for several days. The possibilities are nearly endless here, I’ve started the game over for like 15 or 20 times, and every time I’ve had a different experience. Good thing is, every new world you generate, differs drastically from the last one. You’re getting randomly generated dungeons, biomes, deserts (with pyramids!), jungle, the hell, and all the world objects. There are thousands (literally) crafting recipes, and it will take tens of hours to explore them. Single player is pretty good, and you will enjoy exploring the world, building castles (or dirt houses) and digging deeper into the ground. Multiplayer, however, is absolutely amazing - it really makes the game shine. But try to play with your friends, not with just random people - communicate via Skype, TeamSpeak or whatnot, it will make your experience of dirt digging a lot richer. Trust me.I’d rate this game 9.0 / 10.0			"

												Boy, I remember buying this game when the 1.1 update came out. At that point I thought it was a well-done game, but when 1.2 was released, this game became one of my all time favourites. To get things out of the way, this game is definitely inspired by Minecraft. It takes its elements such as mining, exploring, fighting monters at night, and crafting (along with others), but turns to dial to 11. The part of the game that feels the most ""Minecraft-y"" is when you start off in your world, but after that point the games true colours will start to show through. For clarification, I'm not here to compare this to Minecraft (which I still think is a great game), or even bash it. I'm here to tell you why you should buy Terraria, so let's get to that.First off, here's a few questions: Do you like sandbox games? Do you like games that have a retro 2D twist to them? Do you like playing with friends or by yourself? If your answers were yes, or in the the case of the last one either of the answers, then you might as well have just already bought the game. Not convinced? Ok then.In Terraria, you start off in a forest, with measly copper tools. It's your job to build a shelter before night comes, to build better equipment, and to start mining. As I said earlier, this is where the game feels the most like a 2D Minecraft, but stick with me. Later on you'll gain NPC's which all provide unique services (such as a merchant, or a nurse), and realize how expansive the game really is. Thought that forest you started in was too cliché? Well, wait until you encounter the fiery depths of the Underworld, the blood-curling Crimson, the barran Desert's, or the monster infested Dungeon. These all have their own unique identity in terms of both looks, monsters, and geometry. Think zombies, slimes, and demon eyes are all pathetic losers? Well, wait until you fight an army of Goblin's, a horde of Demon's, and even a legion of blood-thirsty Snowmen. Hate your dinky copper equipment? Wait until you rock a full suit of Shroomite armour, weaponized with a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher. Where you end up in this game is amazing, the journey even more so. I could NEVER give the game justice when it comes to describing how much content and variety exists, so go take a look at the Terraria Wiki. Actually, experience it for yourself.In terms of sound, each monster may have a growl or roar or whatever, but to be honest it's not something you'll really notice. The music though, it's quite amazing. Each envirnment has its own track, which creates an atmosphere you would expect out of a boss battle, a desert, or a snow forest. As for the graphics themself, the game has a very nice retro appeal to it, which is very charming and nice to look at.Progressing however is where the games structure, and even some of its faults start to show up. Progressing through the game involves you killing bosses, which are all unique challenges by the way. You evetually reach Hardmode, where your world transforms with more equipment to get, more monsters to kill, and more bosses and events to fight. However, once you kill a boss called Plantera the games main problem shows up: You need to grind. Now, to be fair their currently isn't a whole lot more progressing at this point, but getting the best equipment can take you a while. Actually, it could take you a shorter amount of time, or even a longer amount of time. That's another problem here: The RNG. There's only a certain chance some items will drop from slain monsters, which is also another issue with the game. Luckily, developer Re-logic is currently working on some more balencing changes, which should be helpful when the endgame update comes out.Oh yes, the developer. Re-logic is amazing when it comes to making Terraria. They listen to their community and regularily keeps in touch with them, and all the post-laucnh content for the game is FREE. No DLC. No micro-transactions. All FREE content. And even though the main dev at Re-logic wont be working on the game anymore after the next update, the game will still be developed for however long it will be.So, in short, Terraria is an excellent game. This review itself does NOT give the game enough justice for just how great it is. For $10, Terraria is a grab. Even the problems I listed above shouldn't minimze your enjoyment of the game, as you'll still have fun throughout your journey. Not every game needs a AAA budget, or a great story to be amazing. And that's Terraria. A 9.5/10 from me, in it's current state (v. 1.2.4.1). When 1.3 releases I'll be sure to edit this review as well.			"

IntroductionI've played this game before on another steam account i had. When i was playing it, i thought Terraria is a boring game and i thought it is really bad game because i did not know what to do and i did not have a friend who can teach me how to play. I have got a friend who played Terraria like 120 hours and we are playing together. He is teaching me how to play this game, how to craft things etc. It is good to have a friend who can play with you and who can teach you.PerformanceMy laptop has got i7 2640M CPU, 8 GB Ram, Intel HD Graphics 3000 GPU and i can play this game without any problems, which is good in my opinion. I was not expecting to have any problems due to how the game looks and i was right. I am playing this game on stable 60 fps.I learnt that this game has got lot of bosses etc so if you think that you can beat the game in a short time, you are wrong. This game is really good game actually and i'm having fun because i am learning how to play and i am playing with my friend. My recommendation to you, is don't buy this game unless you have got someone to teach and someone to play with. I also learnt that you can create what ever you want. Which is good.Fishing is one of the things you should do because you get crates to unlock and you get things to sell. If you go to fishing at night, you will have more chance of getting something good (my friend told me something like that)This game is a little bit hard at the beginning but once you get items (armors, weapons etc) everything will be easier. You will be able to kill bosses etc faster, you will be able to fly which will make climbing and similar things easier. I hope you guys understand what i am trying to say.ConclusionTerraria is a really good game that you can play alone or with your friends. I recommend you to play with one of your friend that knows how to play. Why? Because he can teach you how to play. If you do not have a friend who knows but you want to play, then still buy it. You can learn by playing yourself or with your friend.Score: 10/10 "

												Well, I've been playing this for over 150 hours, so I guess it's about time for a review. Simply put, this is quite possibly the best ten dollars I have ever spent on a game. Terraria has an unbelievable amount of content, and the exploration value never runs out. I've been playing this for several months and I'm  still  not bored with it. There's always something to do. Want to have a quiet evening building your house? Forget about it. There's zombies, demon eyeballs, slimes, classic movie monsters, and a flying Terminator head with four arms and a chainsaw that would have you do otherwise. Do you like pop culture references? So far, I've seen nods to Mario, Legend of Zelda, Pink Floyd, Portal, Christmas Story, Alien, Dark Souls, Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Star Wars, Ice Climbers, Minecraft, Spiderman, and God-knows-how-many more popular titles and franchises. Do you like strange and creative concepts? How would you like to fight off a Martian invasion as a bee-riding werewolf, or kill demons with a yoyo? Does that sound cool to you? Then get this game. I will warn you that starting off can be slow for inexperienced players, but it gets very rewarding later on, especially if you do it with friends.Like my review? Check out my  Curator  page!			"

												This game is amazing, I must say. It was hard to get into at first, but once I figured out you need to talk to the guide to figure out the basics I had an addiction for a while, to say the least. This may seem wierd, but it's like everytime I get on Terraria, it feels like there's ALWAYS something more to do. From FIghting, to farming, to building, to fishing, to mechanics and wiring, to exploring etc. This game ceases to amaze me. And not to mention they're still updating it and adding stuff! My personal favorite game, by far. DEFINATELY worth a purchase.			"

												Tl:dr at the end.Ok, you probably went here to the Negetive side to see down sides of the game however most of the negetive reviewes are either:A go back to the positve side or,B gets boring fast.So here is an actual review that will show the downsides of the game but, know that i did really enjoy the game, its one of my favorite games but here is just the downside.Bad instructions for beginners. Its pretty hard to get into when your new. Having a friend showing you the basics helps. But you will spend alot of time looking at wikis to figure out what to do. Some people may like it since you get to explore. However you will probably miss huge chunks of the games content.It also has alot of useful items only obtainable threw RNG. *cough* cellphone *cough*One slighly more minor thing is that somtimes. Your world or characters may get corrupted. This usually never happens but if it does there is no way to recover them. However this rarely happens. I have only gotten a character lost once without mods.One thing if you do get the game. DONT GET ITEMS FROM OTHER PEOPLE. It does severly ruins the game. If you play multiplayer, make sure you either play with another new player. Or somone who is willing to start over. This game is about the journey not the destination.People who do say this game gets boring fast have gotten items from other people.TL:DR I LOVE THIS GAME. HOWEVER HERE ARE JUST FLAWS AND I PUT IT IN NEGETIVE TO SHOW DOWNSIDES. ODDS ARE YOU WILL LOVE THIS STILL.1. RNG2. BAD INSTRUCTIONS3. SOMTIMES CORRUPTS WORLDS AND CHARACTERS			"

												I have not yet reviewed this game, but I have the feeling that I should. Having +-150 hours into terraria, I can gladly say my money was well spent as I bought it on a sale for just $2,50. The game costs $10 (or 10 euros for me) at full price and I feel that even at $20-$30 this game would still be very much worth it.This game has, since the beginning, been promoted as a 2d minecraft. To be honest, I actually believed that...Until I played the game myself to find out that it is nothing like MC. In minecraft, it is all about being creative and building, whilst in terraria it's more about exploring, getting resources and upgrading equipment to fight epic bosses (to get more epic gear).GAMEPLAY: the gameplay is very enjoyable. The game starts out a bit slowly, as you have NOTHING at all, except for a sword, an axe and a pickaxe. With those tools your adventure starts to find resources, to explore vast caves and to build a (relative) safe shelter/house/castle/whatever :p. There is a lot of progression to be found in this game and I find it very rewarding. Having finally found enough ores to upgrade your equipment, you can fight tougher bosses. You don't need to go through all the equipments though, if you just want good gear rightaway, good luck fighting your first boss without any armour and (with a bit of luck) a few bombs/shurikens ;). There are also accessoiries to be found in this game (like wings, hermes' boots - aka speed boots...) that really increase the fun! After your beat the WOF (wall of flesh), hardmode starts and difficulty increases. You'll find new bosses, new equipment, new ores etc. Be careful though - when hardmode is triggered, there is no way back!YOUR WORLD ""LIVES"": You may be aware of it or not, but when you enter your world, you automatically have to deal with the crimson/the corruption. On normal mode, this is easy controllable, but on hardmode, things can get wild. So better keep your shelter(s) safe from it, because otherwise your NPC's will despawn.NPC's: this game has a lot of NPC's that spawn under certain conditions. You'll need a shelter/house for them in order to enjoy all the goods they sell (seriously, some of them sell amazing things that you absolutely want to have!)MUSIC: this game has some good soundtracks. They change according to where you are (each biome has its own track), or whether it's day or night, you're fighting a boss etc. Even after all those hours I still did not get bored of these enjoyable soundtracks.GRAPHICS: some enjoy them, others don't. I personally think they fit the game really well.So, again, I HIGHLY recommend this game. It offers great fun for countless hours. With friends it becomes even more enjoyable, but singleplayer is amazing too. The only negative point about this game is the ""lack"" of things to do. With this I don't mean there's not enough content, but you'll have to set your own goals. There's no questsystem whatsoever so you'll just have to explore the game yourself and see which hidden treasures you can find.If I had to rate this game, I'd give it an 8.5/10PS. make use of the wiki sometimes, it can provide important information! :)			"

Terraria is an amazing action-adventure platformer with a beautifully generated enviroment. There are tons of different biomes and areas to explore, with unique mobs and loot in them.Weapons are for four different ""classes"" (warrior, ranger, mage and summoner.) Certain items give you bonuses for specific classes, so specializing yourself as one of them will give you a ton more of damage on the chosen weapon style.There is also a wide variety of different accessories and items based on mobility to spice up the regular gameplay. (e.g. double jumps, grappling hooks and even wings.) The list keeps going and going.However there is no particular system for character progression in Terraria. (leveling, skillpoints etc.) But you will be gaining health crystals throughout exploring caves, which increase your maximum HP. Same goes for gathering Fallen stars for increasing maximum mana as mage.In my own opinion, Terraria is one of the best games to play through with your friends. It is almost too addictive, and keeps me grinding for the rare drops no matter how lucky or unlucky I could be.If you're not willing to buy it at full price, make sure to give it a try when it's on sale. (as you're still reading this.) Pros:Huge variety of different weapons and items.Randomly generated world. (every world is different.)Still stuff being added. (updates)Extremely fun with others. (co-op.)Cons:Some might dislike the voxel-based graphics. (personally actually quite like the graphical design.)Some bosses may be really difficult to kill alone. "

												You know, I first got minecraft years ago, just after getting a laptop for my graduation gift in '11. I played the hell out of it. From the time I got it, I played it through summer, at the college library, all through the night at home, whenever. I'd probably gathered well over a thousand hours on that game.But you know what? This game, originally presumed to be some ""2D Minecraft clone,"" which in truth is incomparable to minecraft, and though I probably don't have half the hours on it than I put into minecraft. This game is better than minecraft.Or perhaps minecraft is just a♥♥♥♥♥♥game. Either way, I still like Terraria very much.			"

												Terraria is the game you play when you are bored and like your girls how you like your game dimensions. the joke is 2D but you got it only if you're a F A G like meTerraria devs are people who really listen to their community and add constantly huge stuff into the game (Mega Update coming 30th June 1.3 hype!!!).I can list a few pros and cons for here and there because this game feels like getting them. It's really awesome but not perfect:Pros:+Tons of things you can spend your lifetime doing for (searching for extremely rare drops or collecting all boss trophies like me)+With friends this game is just perfect because of the epic boss fights and actually making tactics against bosses (hell bridges for WoF and stuff like this)+graphics are pixels that have been done very well with a lovely simple style+Game is really easy to mod. You just create your own sprites or just recolor olds and copy/paste their .ini files in a mod folder. (It sounds hard here but this game has literally one of the easiest modding there is)+Tons of potential to become more awesome+Never lacks content+Boss fights are something beautiful+Has funny items (example: Christmas Tree Sword, Sand Cannon, Swordfish) but also epic items, and even beautiful items+Hundreds of hours of gameplay time+Softcore for people who hate in Minecraft that you lose all your gear if you die. You just drop half of your money you carry on that moment+Able to recall to your spawn point with appropriate item/items (Magic Mirror, Recall Potion)+Tons of roles you can get into like in RPG (Healer, Tank, Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Summoner)Something that's pros and cons at the same time:+/-Is fun in singleplayer but it lacks the fun multiplayer brings+/-Some mobs do damage like♥♥♥♥♥♥even though they aren't bosses+/-Playing with a lot of friends is a struggle to find resources sometimesAnd now the cons (God I hate this part):-Even large world is really small for exploring (approx 13,000 Ft from end to end)-Mid-phase in game is really REALLY hard, but lategame with proper items is just too plain easy (i.e. you don't even need to avoid boss hits)-Never finding Magic Mirror-Some enemies resist KB (knockback) like♥♥♥♥♥♥and thus makes early-game Warrior extremel difficult.-You need to git gud in this game before you actually can survive to endgame.My overall opinion is that I love this game way too hard. I have modded the game and I have played the game from 2012 (cracked version I admit pls dont hit me). This game never lacks fun and something to do unless you really have done everything in the game which takes hundreds and hundreds of hours to do. I have played this game for over 300+ hours (if cracked version is added up too) and I still miss a lot from the game. Terraria most fun when you grab your 1-3 friends and go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥pree over who makes houses and who does what and who does that. The game is only 10€ and it's really cheap considering the game has hundreds of hours of content.TL;DR: 9.8/10 me and my friend lose a boss fight because we forgot PvP on and he 1-shotted me and boss 1-shotted my friend. Children never forget PvP on in a boss fight. "

												This is by far the best game I've ever played.  It has different classes and hundreds of weapons that can offer different play styles, but only become prominent until the second phase of the game, as to not complicate things early on in the game.  The two-phase approach to the game is a brilliant idea, changing the world to add new enemies, biomes, ores and more to make sure the player doesn't become overpowered until the late-game, to keep the player on their toes.  There are over a dozen bosses, and lots of other minibosses and events to do as well.  Killing the bosses feels satisfying, because something will happen, or you'll get cool loot.  As well as that, the various NPCs that can be collected throughout the game add a community feel to the game, and keeps you from feeling alone while playing singleplayer.  All the NPCs have unique personalities, and some have...  interesting relations with each other *Cough* Nurse *Cough* Arms Dealer *Cough*.  Even in the postgame, there are still things to do, structures to build, and with a responsive and active dev team that actually takes people's comments to heart (Orange torch).   Overall, I can say that without a doubt, this game belongs on your steam library, there's a nice little spot there, just waiting...  waiting to be purchased and played.  (Warning, the game starts off fairly slow, don't give up, it gets going around the second boss, which is when you can really start exploring)			"

Posted: July 24, 2015
												A lot of friends suggested to me that this is a good game and i should play it. I wasn't impressed of it before i started playing, because it is a 2D game and I'm not a fan of them (when i say im not a fan of them i mean i hate the graphis of these types of games), so you can conclude that this has to be a very special game to impress me so much and make me write a review about it. What I like a lot about this game is that it is so simple to learn, yet so challenging, especially when you have to beat bosses.  Starting out At first you have to create your own character and island. You can customize your character, but the game gets to choose wheather you will have one of the following types of island - infected with corruption or with crimson. Crimson and Corruption  The crimson and corruption are types of bioms which everybody will have on their island. You can have only one of them. The two contain similar hazards, though each has its own unique enemies, items, and blocks. The tools, weapons, and armor obtained via Corruption materials are slightly less powerful than those obtained via Crimson materials, and Corruption enemies are also slightly less powerful.The corruption is purple colloured and the crimson is red colloured. This infection spreads with the time you spend playing on your island. Although some players don't mind it and even let it grow, I personally would advise all new players to make sure that this infection doesn't spread on your island. It infects trees, blocks, even the creatures are different and the music is kinda creepy and really annoying. So at the very beggining of your game find the infected part of your island and try to dig around it - maybe - 4,5 blocks around every infected part. One more thing this infection can spread even underground, so is very important to dig fastly, so you don't have more work later. In the end you will have something like an underground tunell. You can put lights so that it is easier to dig. If you feel lazy to dig, keep in mind that while you dig underground, you can stumble on to different furnitures (yes there are a lot of furnitures, decorated small rooms undrerground which you can take and decorate your house with it). So that can motivate you to dig more. When your tunell is ready, you island is now safe and can't get get infected anymore.  NPC An NPC is an non-player character. This is a friendly automated character that provides different services to players. You just need to stand close to them and you will be able to buy the items they provide. They will generally walk around during the day, they can talk to each other, or to the player. Why it is good to have more NPC in your house? The more rooms your house has, the more NPC will move in and the wider choice of bying items you will have. Also town NPCs that have moved into Houses reduce enemy spawn rates in the area, an effect that increases when more of them move in your house. Equipable items  While digging underground you can find weapons too. Keep in mind that you can equip those weapons and make your character stronger. Also when you beat a boss, you earn even more powerfull weapons. You can equip wings, so that you move faster, different kinds of items which boost your atack speed, health regeneration and e.t.c.  Character and world modes There are 3 types of character modes - softcore, mediumcore and hardcore mode. And there are 2 types of world modes - normal and expert mode. Bosses Defeating bosses makes you advance in the game in some way. Each boss has its own particular way of being summoned, and warning messages appear whenever one is about to appear. There are pre - hard mode bosses, hadmode bosses and event bosses. When defeating a boss, he can drop and item or a weapon (or nothing xD). Stronger bosses drop stronger weapons. Health Health is the character's life count, they look like heart icons and you can find them at the top-right of your screen. Each red heart is equal to 20 health. Taking a lot of damage causes health to drop. Your health will regenerate when you stop taking damage. Regeneration can also be boosted using various equippable items. Also when you dig undreground, you can find  Life Fruit to increase your health. With 15 Life Crystals and 20 Life Fruits used, a character can reach 20 yellow hearts, which equals 500 maximum health.  Multiplayer  The most enjoyable part of this game. If you want to progress faster, you will deffinetelly need friends to play with. The more people, the easier to beat bosses and creatures, find materials and build different kinds of buildings or just explore your island. Summary In conculstion, you can continue playing this game hours and hours before you are able to stop. There is a countless number of materials which you use to make  weapons, armor and a whole bunch of cool stuff you can find exploring your island. You can construct different buildings using the materials you have found and decorate them, you just have to have a big imagination. I absolutelly love the co - op part and it is really fun when you play with someone else. There are bosses which you have to take down and they become harder to kill with higher difficulties, so it is essential to have a buddy to help you out. There is just simply so much to learn about this game that it can never make you bored. Overall 11/10 one of my best choices so far ^^Warning: It is also very important that you  back up your files. It is done when you open the game, before entering your island. You will see a little cloud icon under your character. That is steam cloud and I strongly advise everybody to move their character and world to it.  Overall this is one of the best games I have played so far and there are not many games which are near to give you that joy of playing them.			"

												Alright, let ne start off by saying the game is one of the most amazing games to play. That said, most people do have a challenge trying to survive in it due to the difficuly and some cluttered controls. Personally i enjoy every aspect of the game and find it to be hours of fun with trying to build different houses for the NPC's and fighting the bosses. If your looking for a fun sandbox game with hours of fun then you came to the right place.			"

												Terraria is essentially a 2-D side scroller letting you live your 2-D life. Build a house, have some prick move into your house without your say-so, build another house for said prick, wait for nightfall to see how the torches light up your new prick-free home, discover there are monsters such as zombies, flying eye balls, and more just waiting to literally tear your arms off. Yeah, even if they are eye balls with no limbs or anything...They will tear you limb from limb.   So you decide to dig down into the dark abyss of the ground for minerals that you can craft into weapons and armor to fight monsters that tear you limb from limb and then you discover there are even more powerful monsters that you must destroy to help clear the land so you can enjoy peace and quiet. So you collect loot and build your tiny prick-free home into usually a giant prick-free home filled with all kinds of gear you collected or crafted and are prepared for any monsters or demons. Then it turns out, there is a Giant Flesh monster thing in the very bottom pit of the world that you must destroy. And so the story cycles into a amazing game that is very fun and relaxing and I highly recommend it to any type of game player...........Of course it's all happy 8-bit music and bunnies until you discover while you are away destroying said giant flesh monster thing a prick nurse, prick merchant, and a bunch of other prick NPCs move into your giant supposedly prick-free home.

												Dig, Fight, Explore, Build! Many people think that Terraria and Minecraft are a similar character and it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity. Some people may perfer Minecraft others Terraria, TBH I actsually perfer this. Over my playtime of this (245.3HRS) currently, I had quite some fun on this game. To start off; NPCS can be floating around, you can bassicly explore anywhere, even acquire some of the most CRAZY items that i cant even explain. And did i even mention the bosses? there are so much enemies and things to fight it's not even funny... aswell randomly generated worlds so the fun never stops. Let's not forget about 1.2! when 1.2 released i was amazed at how many items were produced Not only did it add more items, it actsually changed the game. The only let down was the mutiplayer; the IP join thing i diden't really like, i would have liked to seen some kind of server browser or something, but ay you cant go wrong with this game.and oh yeah... get this while it's on sale, $2.49 is a must for this extraordinary game, even $9.99 is a steal.Recommended			"

Terraria.This game.Oh lord, where do I start?I think I'll start off with the fact that this game is more addicting that drugs.In the distant eye of an onlooker, Terraria would most likely be described as a ""2-D Version of Minecraft"". In reality, it's so much more than that. Terraria provides a large world the explore, tons of monsters to defeat, NPC's to befriend, loot to gather, a constant stream of upgrades, loot, and progress.There is always something to do in this game, and it'll most likely benifit your progress in some way or another.The soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are very charming and gives the game a ""SNES"" style to it.If you bring some friends along for the ride, it's even better! The boss fights are amazing, and well designed. Teamwork will play a huge key if you're playing with your mates.Doesn't matter if you're going solo or have assembled a band of merry heroes, Terraria will have something in store for you from the Eye of Cthulhu to the Moon Lord (Even after that).

The 2D graphics are superb and welcoming, it gives some sense of nostalgia when you play.With different world sizes and character death settings, anyone can easily pick up the game and start playing.The bosses are a blast to fight and preparing for the battle is almost as fun as the actual fight itself! One of the biggest aspects of this game is the multiplayer: This game is so much more intereting when you rally up a group of friends and quest together!...If the multiplayer actually worked (x.x )I highly recommend this game to anyone who has $10!

												Terraria is one of those games where it's fun until you literally have everything and done everything then it's not fun anymore..Unless of course one of your friends got another friend to get into Terraria, and you both proceed to watch your friend absolutely suck at the game; struggling to build a house, 10 second reaction time, dying by slims, zombies and fall damage,  then of course I recommend it. Especially if you plan to start fresh on a new world.But no really, 380 hours into this, it's a pretty good sandbox game, really deep, but it starts out slow so be forgiving.			"

We built a few really nice things, and had alot of fun with the game 300+ hours later, the game has alot of replay value to me, trying out the different classes, making potions, hardcore mode, and hours of grinding. This game is not a 2D minecraft, it's a work of art. (Not saying minecraft isn't.) Overall it's a great game for solo and multiplayer with friends.			"

There are plenty of mods that can breath new life into this classic game. You want more bosses? You got it. You want more weapons. Easy. Also most important thing of all. It's MUCH better with friends.PS: I Personally recommend Thorium, Prefixes for Enemies, and Calamity Mod. There are many more however these are the ones I am the most familiar with that bring the most change.			"

												Terraria is a platformer action-adventure sandbox game, almost like minecraft except this is side scrolling and has classic 2D graphics.In Terarria, you start in a randomly generated world, then you start gathering resources by chopping down trees, mining stones, clearing dirts or use them instead, and then you're going have to build houses or anything for a shelter, then you need to make weapons, tools, everything you need to survive from those monsters, especially in the night. Then you can explore the world and find many things interesting. There's also many boss enemies you have to fight here so be ready. This is a good game to waste your time, especially with friends. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												to be honest, i was a bit nervous about getting this game when i heard that it was supposed to be 'a 2d minecraft'.but it's not.it's better than minecraft.you get to customize your character, build little towns, fight bosses, advance through various terrains, make cool equipment and you get to have fun with your friends thanks to the multiplayer :D i'd reccomend this game to everyone and anyone because of how enjoyable it is, and how you can create a new character and a new world, but the game never gets repetitive. each new life, is a new story waiting to be unfolded10/10			"

												This is a story about how Terraria got me into Steam.""You should get steam."" said my friend to me a long time ago, ""Get this game called Terraria, it's like Minecraft but with working multiplayer."". Being a younger me, and following the crowd of minecraft fanatics who were no good at it and had to look up tutorials just to figure out how the hell redstone works, I really liked the sound of this ""Terraria"" thing. At first I was reluctant to use Steam. But once I got into Terraria, many games followed in its footsteps and ended up in my gaming library. To this day, Terraria holds a special place in my heart. Reserving a seat for a possible sequel that is hopefully the gift that I want it to be. That's a nice story, but it doesn't say anything about the game. Let me get to that right now. This is a game that is quite a lot like Minecraft. Only slightly better. ""Better?"" I hear some of you say, ""But it is an ugly 2d piece of poopy that could not compare to the perfection that is Minecraft!"". Aha, but that is where you are wrong, because what it lacks in third dimensions, it makes up for in so many ways. There are more features in this game for you to poke your sword at than Minecraft can propose. Minecraft hands you nothing but your fists and a world to explore. This is a wonderful feeling, building up your home, expanding, killing your first monster, and cooking some meat to keep yourself alive. But the problem with that game, is that once you have the best gear, that's it. You win. You defeat the boss, and it's done. You basically have no reason to play anymore. While with Terraria, once you get the best gear, go beat the boss, you think you beat it. But then you realise that you have unleashed a whole new hell on your self and your awesome armor is now mere paper compared to the new enemies that you will face. Time to upgrade your gear, and reinforce your home, you're in for a bumpy ride. This happens about 3 times. Bring friends along to make it even more fun.The only thing that Terraria fails in is the Survival aspect. If you enjoy having to worry about your food, water, and fatigue, then you may be disappointed. Death is not a worry, all you lose is some money. The loss of which is easily prevented via use of a convenient piggy bank. Food in this game gives buffs to make you fight better, but it isn't necessary to your survival. The only liquids you will drink are ones that will heal you or give you more mystical energy, and sleeping is a foreign concept to the people of Terraria, beds only serve their purpose as a resurrection point for the common folk. This game is a fun game to play by your self, or with friends. However harder on your own. But more rewarding. Another bad thing is that this game has a lot of good loot that you may just have to have for yourself, which will require you to farm certain enemies many times to get them to drop one. I do recommend that you get this game and give it a good run. It's only 10 USD, but it gives so much more than your 10 dollars worth.			"

												Note: to see this review in its true form go to http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/03/game-terraria.htmlTerraria, This game is one of my TOP games of all time. first i want to compare the game to the uber-famous Minecraft. i know, i know they aren't the same but a lot of people seem to think they are.First you need to realize what kind of game Terraria is. it is NOT a game where you build epic cities (well,some people do) its more based on combat,crafting,exploring, and fighting epic bosses. Terraria seems to do a lot of the stuff Minecraft does but better. Combat is way more fun and there are at least 50 weapons in the game. from Shark-powered guns to spear and TNT sticks. There is Magic with all kinds of spells. you can get special ammo for you guns, like one that tracks your target. and there are ROCKET launcher! need i say more? Combat in Terraria is fast and fluid (and a little bit gory). Players can fight PVP or PVE.  and one of the best parts in Terraria, Bosses. These large hostiles range from rather easily to insanely hard, making Co-op and almost must to finish the biggest Boss. and even when you defeat the most powerful enemy in your wold, The Wall of flesh, you aren't done. on the Walls death your world is overcome with even more powerful enemy and several new tougher bosses. needless to say this will keep you busy for a while.Now, Exploring in Terraria is better to me than Minecraft. i can't really explain but Terraria's underworld and caves feel more random and different than Mincraft Caves. also with some many different biomes there really is a lot to discover, like a mushroom biome or a jungle or a giant bee hive. Terraria has a simple feature that makes exploring easier and more fun, and that is real-time torches/lighting. by this i mean that you can just hold out a torch without placing it and it will light the way. (it makes me feel like Indiana Jones). later in the game you can get a miners helmet that lets you use your weapons/gear without having to place lighting. the liquid in Terraria is more life-like, because liquids don't spawn an infinite source they can and will drain away if you make a hole or pump it all out.Terraria has a lot of neat little features like gear, you can get wings,jetpacks,measure tools, and more. one of my favorite items is the ivory whip. this allows you to cling to walls making it a lot easier to climb and build. another fun thing in Terraria are the NPCs. these guys/gals will move into Empty homes that meet the requirements, and then sell you items like weapons,ammo,gear,blocks,wires(more on that later), and even Party items.another epic feature in Terraria is the wire system. it is what it sounds like. a red-stone like system that allows you to control pumps,lighting,traps, and doors. The Wire system in Terraria has some better features that Minecraft. you can put the wires anywhere and they are not visible unless you are holding a wrench.And even with all these features and with a second gaming be made the Devs still update and fix bugs in Terraria. Terraria is well worth your $15.			"

												A very fun and in-depth building/exploration game. The early game is pretty bland and boring but after a few hours of playtime the game gets very interesting. Getting your first mount, making a cool outfit for your character, crafting that epic armor set you've been mining/grinding for, catching a super rare loot drop while fishing, getting that item drop you've been farming the boss/mobs for hours to get. All these will be one of the most satisfying things you've ever experienced.14 different bosses with unique mechanics and loot drops. There's also expert mode which adds new boss mechanics and a new loot drop for every single boss.And much more! All this for 10 euros, with the game frequently going on -75% sales. Just buy it already, and watch the hours fly by.			"

												Amazing game that I cannot recommend enough. The game has so much content in it, and the developers are very generous. They have not added a bit of paid DLC, and instead added new content through updates, which is the way it should be. The game contains over 3000 in-game items and around 350 different kinds of enemies. The game is also only $9.99 and goes on sale for around $2.49. For the price the developers are asking it is a steal. Terraria is just a great game and I recommmend it to anyone.			"

The good Plenty of stuff to do.  On a straight playthrough, there is probably 10-20 hours of content to get to the endgame for a normal player.  There is plenty of other stuff to explore and build Sandbox game Graphics are well-though out and simple, with a relatively clean feel that I like in this style of games Multiplayer is fun if you can find people to play with Relatively simple fighting mechanics, but enough variability in weapons and playstyles to keep the game interesting Simple systems in the game (wiring, sloped blocks) are easy to learn but have interesting mechanics if you prod at them a lotThe bad Early game is slow Endgame is either difficult or slow if you aren't playing with friends Item management is a mess No steam integration (will change with 1.3 update) Gets boring if you don't have a specific goalVerdictBuy if you like sandbox games and have friends to play with.  Terraria goes on sale frequently for 50-75% off.  Don't buy if you need a story to appreciate a game or can't stand grinding for the first hour or so in game.			"

Posted: April 1, 2016
												Since there are more owners of Terraria on my friends list than there are owners of Portal or Portal 2, this is probably the ultimate gratuitous review. Chances are you’re already familiar with the game and you already have deep-seated opinions about it. Even so, I’m going to write out this review to provide some closure and articulation to my own thoughts.Before trying it, I assumed Terraria was 2D Minecraft. I was wrong. Although many game elements are clearly inspired by Minecraft, and comparisons between the two games are inevitable, they are very different games. Terraria is less of a sandbox game, and more of an action-RPG with destructible terrain. The focus is placed on questing, combat, and underground exploration. In Minecraft, you can have the ultimate equipment after a sufficiently lucky 30-minute cave exploration, but in Terraria it can take 40 hours or more to conquer all the quests and the bosses. Minecraft is largely a survival and engineering game – success comes through careful planning and calculated risks. Unlike Minecraft, Terraria’s building aspect is severely downplayed. There’s no survival element at all since you’re given unlimited, (almost) consequence-free respawns.Terraria is tricky to criticize; all of its greatest strengths are simultaneously also its deepest, most irreparable flaws. These are elements you can’t remove from the game – removing them would destroy what makes it uniquely Terraria – but they cause so many problems in the grander scope that they hinder and ultimately destroy its longevity. First issue: items are tied to the character rather than the world. If you load up your character’s inventory with loot, you can simply hop into another server and it all goes with you. On the surface, this is a fantastic idea that allows you to grow attached to a character and continue their adventure across multiple servers. The big problem comes with multiplayer. This system absolutely does not work with mismatched character levels. At all. Power creep is massive in this game, and so is “bored god syndrome."" A maxed character can plough through all the game’s events in about a half hour, whereas it takes a good 20-40 hours to do everything from scratch. Underleveled characters won’t be able to keep up. Powerful characters don't like waiting around for them. This is especially problematic playing with newbies who don't know the game’s basic progression. If a newbie is on a server with high-level characters, they won't learn how to summon the Eye of Cthulhu, or what demon altars do, or what the Pwnhammer is, and so much more. They’ll be given some spare items without getting to learn where they came from and how they were made. Worst of all, the weak characters will know that they aren’t contributing anything to the server since they can’t do anything that the overleveled characters can’t do with fifty times more efficiency. And since there's no server option to force a blank character, there is no way to prevent this from happening. Having been on both sides of this coin, I can honestly say that it’s depressing to see or to be a weak character playing on a server with strong characters.Another issue is that the game has far, far too many items. Compared to Minecraft’s 5 sword tiers, There are over 75 different swords alone in the game. Multiply that by the types of bows, pickaxes, armors… and that’s not even counting the block types, potions, fish, accessories, plants… We're talking over 3,500 different types of items.It’s great because it adds a deeper sense of diversity to the game. Unlike Minecraft, you can actually choose a pseudo-class in Terraria, specializing in any kind of combat. You can then collect and manage the items that are beneficial to that class. It’s satisfying being something other than a standard diamond-armored archer like in Minecraft. And it keeps exploration fun: the game can always surprise you with rare drops and new discoveries at every turn. But at the same time, the staggering number of items in Terraria just goes to show how smart Minecraft was for limiting them. Storage and categorization of items is an utter nightmare. Now, Terraria includes many conveniences to help you manage your items, including auto-sorting your inventory into nearby chests, ability to use color-coded and named chests, the complete bypassing of the crafting grid by simply listing all the crafting recipes for you, and even a garbage can built into the inventory screen itself. Yet, even with all these great inventory tweaks, it still isn’t nearly enough to keep the sheer number of items from overwhelming you, stuffing your inventory full. Item sorting is so time-consuming that I always gave up on keeping an organized storage room, and just started dumping my items in the nearest open space. The times when I decided to tackle the organization, I’d give up after an hour and not even be halfway done. It’s probably the most unfun part of the game.Furthermore, many of these items are useless because game progression happens a bit too fast. You’ll make a full set of Iron armor, then get Demonite ten minutes later, Meteorite thirty minutes after that, and so on… repeated for about 20 tiers of items. You’ll constantly be throwing away tools you may have only used for a few minutes before making something better. If you want to fully appreciate any one tier, you’ve got to intentionally slow down your play and pace yourself. It’s awesome that the game is self-paced… if you’ve got the patience for it.And finally: the longevity problem. You know how some RPGs hide the best sword in the final dungeon where it’s useless because there’s nothing left to use it on? That’s Terraria’s endgame in a nutshell. It’s so bad that there’s been two huge updates which have basically doubled the length of the game progression, one adding a “hard mode” that adds several more quests, and another adding an “expert mode” that serves as a “new game plus” for your overleveled character to conquer. But it still just prolongs the inevitable for a few dozen hours. Worlds are fixed size and are not infinite, and there’s no sense of risk and reward because deaths mean nothing and you can always use your trusty Magic Mirror to panic out of a bad situation. The core of the gameplay is the long, progressive struggle for power; once you have the power, there’s no gameplay left unless you want to start all over again. Unlike a Minecraft server which is infinitely large and immersive, a Terraria server will “end” and ultimately be used up completely, unable to offer anything new. Clinging to your character and taking your loot to a new server will just make the same thing happen, but faster. The only way to keep the game alive is to let go and start over – but after all the work it took to become a god, will you really want to do that?Despite any complaints, I loved the game. Those 100+ hours were incredible while they lasted. I laughed, I cried, I raged, I geeked out over stats, I soared through the sky on beetle wings. I discovered mystery and celebrated victory alongside my friends, and I made some memories I might never forget. The questionable design choices I complained about were deliberate risks which made the game into exactly what it is. They may have caused game balance to ultimately crash into a wall due to the ridiculous power creep involved, but the ride itself was completely worth it. I’ll give Terraria a 7 / 10. It may not last forever like some other sandbox games, but there’s too much here to discover and enjoy. If you haven’t played this game the way it is best played – with everyone starting from scratch at once, without overpowered friends doing everything for you – you’re missing out. Terraria is about the journey, not the destination.			"

												Classic story time, yippee skippy. Terraria is a classic veteran of my library that was originally given to me as a gift. Being the tasteless, unrefined scrublord that I was back in the day, I didn't understand the controls and the fact that ""E"" was not universally the use button. I then dismissed it and left it alone for 3 months before picking it up again. It was the best decision I had ever processed through my hormone-riddled child mind. Terraria is a beautifully crafted game that only aged well (so far, but in a game like this it's hard to mess up), like cheese to wine.PROS:+ Mother of Jesus I can have all this content and you're telling me I DON'T have to purchase DLC for it? You're telling me there is NO in-game purchases for self-entitled whiny brats? Oh Re-Logic, you lovable scamps you. Seriously marry me I have the ring in my back pocket and my front pockets and my trachea + Better than Minecraft in many different regards, and you don't even NEED to mod this game or be in 3D to experience it! Sure, lack of depth. Lack of environtment or whatever. Hope the sheer amount of gear and lack of the ""we sold this game to Microsoft"" smell compared to unmodded Minecraft doesn't mean jack to you.+ Virtually no bugs! Unless you go about searching them to report 'em and be a buzzkill/sincerely good person, playing the game normally shouldn't really cause any problems. Hey Skyrim, look at THIS game and tell me that it needs Unofficial Patches, eh?+ Customization is just oh. Gimme some'a dat. More costume items then you have chests for. Dyes in all colors of the rainbow (including rainbow). A recently-added feature that allows your trinkets to be shown visually on the player. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ANY OF IT.  Stop complaining TF2, Spiral Knights and Fashionogi, you got burned so hard dry ice is backing away in fear.CONS:- The griefing can be a real pain. This all depends on the moderation and quality of the server, however. Walking into a server, you can expect to see either a beautiful metropolis with almost all the real estate taken up, or a barren wasteland devoid of all asthetic wonders besides for dirt walls floating in the sky and some torches. Maybe a table. - Adding on to the whole griefing con, TNT and explosives in general. These simple blocks (and two ammo types) and throwable projectiles can WRECK near anything in the environment, which includes your house. Fortunately for you, most good servers come with some form of protection so that your house isn't raided and destroyed after 3 hours away. Or you could, y'know, share a house with someone else.In conclusion, Terraria is good. No, I'm serious. You read any of my reviews? This is normally a paragraph in itself. But whatever, TERRARIA IS GOOD. IT JUST IS OK TRUST ME I KNOW WHAT I'M KNOWING JESUS CHRI			"

												I don't feel like writing a big review, yet, I feel the need of reviewing it.PS: I am also a Minecraft player, but these two are way more different than you think! It is not Minecraft 2D!Terraria is a sandbox, crafting based, metroidvania, rpg, surviving, exploration game. You actually have to do something, a sort of ""campaign"".It's not only about surviving, because there isn't a hunger system, you could just build a small house and stay there forever.You want to be the best, you want to rule the world, you want to thrive.This is all about crafting and gather resources. The last one isn't easy, there are mobs waiting for you in caverns.The world is finite, and filled with danger. It is split in 2 parts (pre-mode and hardmode), both fun, different and with lots of things to do, to craft and to kill.Content: This game is now 5 years old! The developers are still updating the game with huge, FREE content patches, they never made us pay for a DLC, never once.PROS+ Vast amount of stuff, items, weapons, ores and enemies (near 3800 different items if I'm not mistaken)+ Amazingly balanced difficulty (you can do everything individually, no friends needed)+ Fun, hell yeah+ Multiplayer, bring your friends, if you have any+ Repeatability - I've started over again more times than I should+ Sandbox - It really is sandbox+ Addictive+ Free massive content updates!CONS- Dying can be frustating- You may give up early- The game might be too long and time consuming- Retro-style isn't for everyoneGreat game overall, I wish there was more games that hook me this much.

												Oh gosh.Terraria. Ter-freaking-raria.Where do I begin?Well first off, I wish to write this because I LOVE this game. I also want to write this because I come across a lot of people who are like ""u r dum, minceraft iz bettr."" I even had a friend who, whenever I said the word Terraria, would correct me by saying ""You mean, 2D Minecraft."" Those are the people who probably haven't gotten past the spawning point. Yes, the basics of Terraria are rather comparable to Minecraft; you break trees, make a crafting station, build or dig a house, and go mining. Simple, right?That is, until you reach further into the game.This game gives you a reason to explore each biome. There's a massive variety of enemies, most of which drop specific items needed to make specific things. On that note, Terraria has over a hundred different enemies, while Minecraft only has a small handful. Most of Minecraft's mobs don't quite belong in a number of biomes either. I can understand spiders in jungles and forests, but not skeletons. Those belong in the desert (or underground where Terraria's skeletons spawn). When creating a home in Minecraft, the only thing that influences your opinion is your favorite biome. I tend to make homes in deserts because it's a lot easier to see and traverse. However, in Terraria it's a lot more than that. Each biome has its own unique music, as well as their own set of hazards. Here, I make my home in the basic forest biome because it has the easiest set of enemies. And, the trees are in the background and don't obnoxiously block your way or obscure your vision like Minecraft does. (If possible, in Minecraft I'd prefer to live on a mushroom island, which doesn't spawn hostile mobs and actually has a uniquely-spawning creature, Mooshrooms. But even those are so rare to find I don't even bother.)There's a ton of unique loot with each biome too. I know what you're thinking; Minecraft has jungle temples and desert pyramids as well. True, but I'm in no mood to trudge over vast lands just to find a jungle or desert that doesn't even have a darn temple because they're ridiculously rare. And even if I did find one, what's the point of looting nothing but bones and rotten flesh? The chance of finding gold, diamonds or emeralds in these chests is beyond incredible. Terraria's naturally-generated structures are guaranteed to spawn within the world, with the exception of the desert pyramid (but even that got an increase in spawn rate with a recent patch).I get it, Minecraft is full of dungeons and other things. I'll also admit that the loot you can find in dungeons and mineshafts is well-varied and has a good amount of surprise factor. I don't have a problem with mob spawners either. But it doesn't come close to the variety of Terraria's dungeons. Most biomes have an underground extension of themselves as well, each with their own different kinds of loot. Yes, a lot of items will generically spawn in any chest, like torches and coins. But each chest is guaranteed to have something of peculiar value; this could be an accessory, a new weapon, or potions (which are so ridiculously tedious to brew in Minecraft that my brewing stand is collecting dust). Furthermore, these special items also vary depending on the biome. Makes sense that I'd find an Ice Blade in the underground arctic. So like I said, while it's possible to get almost every good item in Minecraft while staying in a single biome, you need to explore almost every inch of Terraria's world to get the full adventure.Speaking of which: Terraria's sense of adventure is awesome. Each place you explore is always different from the last, with accompanying music to only add to the effect. One time, during my first playthrough in Terraria, as soon as I fell into the underground layer, out in the distance I could see the purple glow of Demonite through the darkness. As I stared at it, thinking ""what the heck is that...?"" the underground music started to play. In the trace-like part of the first few seconds of that music, a shiver went down my spine. I knew that this was going to be an awesome adventure. And let me tell you, it was. Exploring the cavern layer, raiding the Dungeon while fighting various angry skeletons, discovering shrines in the jungle and dying like a noob while trying to fly over the lava oceans in the underworld.The Dungeon has a huge sense of history. It has different walls, and different banners to indicate different legions that once inhabited the Dungeon. Only, there are still the average Angry Bones and Dungeon Slimes. Only after you defeat Plantera in Hardmode, a message will appear saying ""Screams echo from the Dungeon..."" Upon revisiting the Dungeon, there's a whole swarm of new enemies. As you learn, only specific types of enemies correspond to their different legions, only spawning within the walls of the legion they belong to. So basically, these centuries-old beings reappear because their angered souls are unable to be put to rest, causing them to haunt the Dungeon and attack you. And even after all this time of being undead, they still remain loyal to the legion they were a part of so long ago.Gulp, gulp... hold on, I'm drinking in all this atmosphere.You know what else I love about this game? The combat system. Yes, you start off with a really lame copper shortsword that does nothing but poke things. That's nothing compared to Minecraft's wooden sword, as the shortsword has an extremely limited range, and you can't really aim where to hit. You can also make a bow, just like in Minecraft. I will admit that Minecraft's bow makes more sense in the way that you have to charge it first before firing the arrow, while Terraria's bow can  fire every half second as long as you keep clicking. But Minecraft's combat just about stops there.I understand, even Terraria has simple upgrades of swords depending on what they're made of. However, many swords are different, such as the Muramasa and the Night's Edge. I'll also admit that most swords have the same functon; swinging around your character at varying speeds depending on the sword. But some of them have different effects. The Fiery Greatsword sets things on fire and glows brightly, helping to illuminate caves when you're out of torches. And others like the Enchanted Sword can fire a beam-like projectile, which can help if you're out of ammo on bows or guns.Oh yeah, that's right. This game has guns, by the way, and a multitude of different bullets, more of which are available the further you progress through the game. The same goes for arrows, because there's also a whole lot more than just a wooden bow. Once you make a repeater, which is a sharp upgrade to the standard bows, it makes sense to hold the mouse button and constantly fire arrows; because it's a machine, not a normal bow. Just as well, Terraria has a large amount of magic weapons, which are my personal favorite (Edit: Nope, Summoner weapons).Another thing, this game has so many challenging bosses. I know, Minecraft has some of its own as well. But the Wither is completely optional and nearly impossible to summon, and the Ender Dragon can only be fought by finding a Stronghold, which each world can only spawn three of, making it impossible to find. Terraria's bosses are usually in a set order as you progress, and they usually drop epic weapons... or items used to craft epic weapons.I just realized there's a character limit, so I'm gonna wrap this up now. Terraria is one of my favorite games ever, and it has succeeded where Minecraft has failed. I say it is certainly worth your money, especially since it's less than half of Minecraft's price. Some might say these games are too different from each other to be comparable. I've played Minecraft in its entirety as well. But if I had to choose, it'd be Terraria all the way.Why do I have to keep writing these walls of text?Just freaking buy it already. "

												Where can I begin. I first saw terraria when at a friends house. This was back before there was even hardmode in the game. I imideately fell in love. When I got home however, I soon forgot about terraria. Almost a full year passed and I one day I thought about it again. I decided to try to convince my parents to buy it for me. Terraria was on sale for 5 dollars at the time and was kind of a no brainer. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE. Despite being on a potato system, I played the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. Fast foreward to 2016, I realized that I never wrote a review for this gameI rate 10,000 out of 10.Seriously just buy it. If i was told I needed to rebuy terraria, but it now cost 150 dollars I would still get it. This game is worth it.For less then 20, its a ♥♥♥♥ing steal			"

												Just when you think you have discovered everything, you realise you have only just started.... This game blows minecraft out of the water in my opinion. The music is well composed and is always changing depending on which biome you are in, unlike minecraft  the map is finite, yes... but the amount of content crammed into that island is just amazing. The weaponry and magic items are created with incredible imagination and a bit of twisted, demonic humour ( my favorite sword being named "" The demonic blood butcherer"") I even came across an enemy by the name of tim, a dark caster in a cavern. After a bit of research i confirmed my suspicions to tim being a reference to ""Tim the enchanter"" from Monty python and the holy grail. This game is an absolute 10/10, Great gameplay, Great music, and a fun twist of sadism. BEWARE THE FIRST BLOODMOON!!!!			"

												This game is 2d side scroller meets minecraft meets rpg meets sandbox to say the least.But it is so much more.Instead of describing every little thing its best to just generalize the gameTheres basically 2 parts, pre-hardmode and hardmodepre-hardmode is the 1st part of the game consisting of semi-hard mobs, events, and bosses.hardmode is the 2nd part that you unlock after beating the 1st part. It contains alot tougher mobs, events, and bosses.Theres alot of different biomes, both above ground and underground. Each changes as you switch from one mode to the other.This game is pretty cool in both visuals and replay value.If anything, the 2-d aspect of this side scroller game gives it its unique and abstract appeal. This game is only as fun as your imagination allows you.The community is pretty decent too compared to other games.Theres a PC, Console, and Mobile version of the game, each with varying small details and unique mobs/bosses.PC obviously has the most content due to PC's handling more graphics and having more storage space and programs.Whoever, the mobile and console versions are just as good and i would highly recommend trying those out as well (i have all 3 versions)The fun isn't limited to just solo, playing it with friends is also an option, and is alot more fun. This game is pretty much done with updates (at least thats what i thought until they made the newest wire and mechanics update). Still, theres always the possiblity that they can add more content later on down the line. Still, with the current content its still pretty fun.***** 5/5 stars no question			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												So after 600+ hours, I figured I knew enough about the game, and I will say that it is a great game. It was a great experience learning new things for me and getting overpowered quick. The only thing that I really didn't like however, was that npc housing is very ""glitchy"" to say the least, but the game is incredibly creative for 2d, but I really don't like how certain methods of doing things can leave a very broken gameplay to say the least. Like certain weapons should be nerfed massively. I also tried the game out with several mods and enjoyed that as well.Overral GREAT game: so worth $10 spent.If you like sandbox and exploration games THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.10/10			"

												Terraria is the first and by far most polished game in 2D sandbox exploration/building genre.Aside from expected core concept of mining for resources and building your house or settlement, Terraria puts stronger emphasis on combat – particularly epic boss battles – than most other games of this genre. There are a lot of challenging bosses to fight, each with their own fighting style that requires specific tactical approach. And depending on how well you are equipped, regular enemies can pose a constant threat, especially in the areas that are meant to be hard. There is also a huge selection of weapons and magic spells (that act just like weapons, but require mana for each use) available to the player, most different from the others not just in damage they do, but in how they work in general. So the combat mechanics is very good when it comes to both enemies and the player.When it comes to environment, Terraria has a fair amount of different biomes, each of which is very well-designed with unique enemies, treasures and atmosphere. Terraria also has very interesting Corruption/Crimson/Hallow mechanics that is currently unique among the games of this genre. Corruption, Crimson and Hallow are biomes that spread over time, consuming other biomes, and keeping them contained (if you make it your goal) can be a real challenge in the Hardmode, where few things can halt these biomes’ growth.If you enjoy 2D sandbox exploration/building genre and somehow missed Terraria, you should most definitely give it a try! And if you haven’t played the games of this genre yet, Terraria is a solid choice to get familiar with it.			"

												Terraria is one of my favorite games of all time!Graphics look very good. Every biome is colorful, looks different and overall looks very nice. And before you say it's pixelated i am not talking about resolution, i am talking about how it looks and is pleasing to the eye.Gameplay is more in a straight line. In Minecraft, you do what you want, but you follow a set path, iron, diamonds, nether.... In Terraria this is expanded even more, because of bosses, hard mode, and new ores.Controls are very good. This is a game that was meant to be played on PC, and it feels like it, which means playing with a controler is not recommended. Anyways, everything feels smooth, and the control will work in more peacefull situations, like building a house, and in boss fights and other times where fighting is a must.Another amazing thing about Terraria are the classes. If you play alone, you can use what you want, but you can adapt to one of the classes - melee, gunner or mage. This comes very helpfull in multiplayer, when in other games everyone wants the best weapons, here everyone plays with only weapons and armor of his class.There are also some bad things in Terraria. One thing is you can't have an infinite world. Don't get me wrong, if you select large world it is pretty large, but even then you can run out off chests, or you may not get that pyramid in your world which isn't very good. Luckily you can play with your character on other worlds, but you have to leave all of your structures from the other world.Another thing that can be stressfull is mining for ores, especially the end-game ores. To craft armor, you need around 50 ingots, and for every ingot you need 3-7 ores. This can take a long time, especially if you're playing multiplayer and everyone wants armor, but someone has to do other things than mining.The last bad thing is that items you can buy are very expensive, so you must make a gold farm, or sell all of your freshly mined ores to buy them.Overall, Terraria is a fantastic game and if you have time to play it, there shouldn't be many problems. And if you become bored of the random worlds, different biomes and play styles, there is also a ton of mods, or custom maps to try.TLDR:Terraria is a really well made 2D Sandbox game.If you like sandbox games, there is plenty of stuff to do, like building and decorating.If not, you can still go through the game, keep progressing, getting better equipement and defeating bosses.If you are interested in both of these, then Terraria is a game for you!

												Terraria gives a great bang for its buck, its a completed game with.... rare updates and a solid system.TLDR: It lasts a long time, its good but the fun wont last forever.The game is based around the following (and in order):Chop some treesBuild a baseGo miningGet through common ore tiersExplore large caves and random dungeonsBeat skelletor Raid cool dungeon, get a better swordKill the Wall of flesh and misc bosses etc.Blow up demon altersGet more oresAdvance furtherGet wingsSurvive through hordes of monsters at night for random reasonsbuild a cooler basenowwhat?.jpgDo it all over again, kill more monsters, collect top tier items etc.What Im trying to say here is the TL;DR at the beginningStory: 7/10 (Not fleshed out.)Gameplay: 10/10 Presentation: 9/10 (Pixel art... can't really go wrong. however not stunning)Soundtrack: 7/10 (Repetitive, not very diverse)Replayability: 2/10 (Maybe some for building, but mostly just for Co-Op)			"

TLDR:Adding to the positive reviews that this game deserves. Amazing game, must buy, should be in anyone's games list.Short Review:Not much to be said that someone else hasn't already said. I have played every game in Terraria's genre and nothing comes close to being as good as Terraria. There is a reason it's the most rated game on Steam. Terraria is perfect for people that want to have a lot to do, but also is great for people that just want to express their creativity with building random stuff.Terraria Otherworld hasn't been announced for steam yet, so if you read this you should post on their forums for a steam release. Amazing Game: 10/10 "

												While some people would call it a 2D version of minecraft. The fact that you mine ressources to fight some boss is where their similarities mainly end.While miencraft has much mor eemphasis on building large sculptures, structures and machines. Terraria focuses more on an RPG-esque style. With different fighting styles, armors and weapons to acommodate different playstyles as you go through thte game.With friends this game is really entertaining. You can sink hours into mining in the underground, building a haven and craft all sorts of items and weapons and gear to helpy ou on your adventure.The map is large, and the underground is massive with lots to explore. Unique locations and enemies specific to biomes and locations in the game.The game has so many things you can do that you can easily sink up to 100 hours into it as it stands. And even then coming back to it and do it all again with a new character with more friends, new ideas on how to play or even challenges can make the game even more fun as well.That being sad the game is not flawless. The crafting system is simplified compared to minecraft since you only need the materials and crafting station to make items. But there are so many recipes that it is easy to get lost.It is hard to tackle the game without using a wiki at the side, which can ruin the experience for some people, The expert mode is incredibly hard and sees you dying a lot so if you don't like that either the game is not for you either.The game's style is pixelart and feels a bit retro, which can turn people of as well. The soundtrack is relaxing and and shares a somewhat retro feel to it.The bosses are fun to fight against and provide challenges to overcome and preparing for them can be tedious while for some it adds more excitement to it.Finally playing with friends means that some of you will be undergeared throughout your playthrough which can be annyoign for those who aren't well geared. The only way to work around is too cheat (not condoned) or farm ressources for a very long time.Overall I'd say the game is worth your time. it is cheap and if you can play with friends it becomes an enjoyable experience. I personalyl feel like playing it in single player really makes you miss out on the fun. But it is relatively cheap so I say get it if you have a weekend to spend with your friends.			"

												Terraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's Example on the kind of enemies you could come across. Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton.As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience. Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground.The weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.PROS+Loads of content for hours of game time.+Great combat system.+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.+Provides a good challenge.+Fun and creative boss battles.+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.CONS-No infinite world option.-Still no easy way to download mods/texture packs.Overall rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)

												Terraria; the simple 2D sandbox game. Before you say it, this is NOT another Minecraft clone. There are 100s even 1000s of differences between the two games. If you're down for more than just building then Terraria is the game for you. Not only is it a sandbox mode game but it's filled with adventure. You start off by building your world and then you're slapped into this beautiful 2D world filled with flowers, trees, bunnies and more. You need to not only build a house to survive in but you need to build a house for NPCs to come to your world so that you can buy guns, bombs, get heals, etc. As you get more and more geared up you keep taking on more and more bosses. With the addition of the 1.3 patch a lot more content got added to Terraria so there's more to explore and more bosses to kill. You can even up the difficulty if you're up for a real challenge. If you love to be creative and have an amazing time adventureing then Terraria is the game for you. Terraria is a must have for ANY Steam user so why not buy the game for not only yourself but your friends. You won't regret it. You'll spend countless hours farming, building and adventuring all while you're in the good company of your friends- Insane amount of content- Great combat- Challenging bosses- Beautiful Soundtrack- Huge updates- Amazing art- Events (Pirates, Solar Eclipses, Slime Rain, etc)Final Verdict;10/10			"

More like 2D World of WarcraftTerraria offers many opportunities, if you are looking for a Hack and Slash type of game. The game is about getting better equipment, fighting monsters and beating bosses. This is nothing like Minecraft don't be mistaken, just in 2D building bases and other constructions looses its meaning. Terraria remind me of 2D World of Warcraft much more than Minecraft. There is a big potential in crafting system, but it is very confusing for new players, too many types of material and a huge scale of items that you don't even know what to do first, but luckily you don't need most of it - just give it enough time and you might more than like it. 6.5 /10 "

												Love this game so much. I bought it while it was on sale for $2.50 which is like less than the cost of a meal nowadays, but, as one can probably see, gave me many more hours of enjoyment than any meal could have. The amount of content and hours of enjoyment in this game make me feel it's worth well more than the full $9.99. There's something in here for everyone. If you like fighting, there's a large variety of weapons to choose from to defeat your enemies. Or you can be more like me and build systems of traps and summon minions to do all the killing for you. If you like creating stuff, there's tons of different building blocks and decorations and paint to make your creations beautiful. If you like destroying the world, EXPLOSIVES. If you like collecting pets, the bug catchers net will let you collect all the little critters in the game. And so on. Oh and there's Multiplayer for people that like that too, I don't really touch that much because I'm forever alone, but it's there!10/10			"

												This game has officially taken over my life. Solo or not, this game is awesome.If you like ""sandbox"" games, pixel graphic, dungeon exploration with rpg elements, you should try terraria.At first glance, Terraria seems to be a lackluster indie game with a clunky, confusing interface and a list of crafting options a mile wide.There is a lot to learn, that is for sure, but the game is so much fun. Once you've learned basics like what to do and what not to do and have found a few useful items to help you properly maneuver through the worlds of Terraria, you will likely find something that peaks your interest. Don't forget you are not bound to the ground!!I find something new in this game literally every day! Terraria never fails to amuse and surprise me, I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in building, landscaping, exploring dungeons, multi & single-player boss fights/mob fights, zombie survival, open-world sandbox!!

												Many people like to compare this game to the worldwide famous sandbox that is Minecraft. They generally quote ""Minecraft 2D clone"" and such, however, Terraria is nothing like Minecraft in its diverse crafting world and gameplay.Terraria is more or less based on epic boss fights, advancing into the game further, and amazing fights against mobs of enemies  in the ground, sky, overworld, and hell. The enemies vary greatly and each have their own special rare drops and common drops, such as money, which is used to buy from the various merchants that exist around the world. We'll get into merchants later. But now, let's dive into Terraria a bit more.Terraria has an astounding amount of gear, armor, weapons, and items that are used to craft boss summoning items and whatnot. The crafting system and just how diverse the item structure in this game never ceases to astound me. The player starts out with a set of tools - shortsword, axe, and a pickaxe - and lets them explore the world of Terraria. There is a guide NPC, however, who will help the player throughout the game, so the player is not jumping into an unknown world, but generally, you get to explore on your own. Oh. Don't worry. When you die, you lose only your money, unless you decide to change the settings of your character. After your familiarize yourself with the system, you further advance into the game by upgrading your armor and tools. Some special items are bought from merchants, which are unlocked by obtaining the different items they carry (finding bombs unlocks the Demolitionist, and finding ammunition unlocks the Arms Dealer, etc.), and building homes for them to live in. Items are purchased from these merchants with money dropped from enemies. More money is found from defeating tougher enemies that are found farther underground, and harder enemies are fought when Hardmore is unlocked by defeating the special boss in hell. Afterward, more and more enemies, bosses, and items are unlocked throughout the game and the player is free to explore and advance further. There's too much content to talk about in a review, you'll just have to check it out yourself.The only bad thing about Terraria is when you finally defeat the ending boss and obtain all his possible loot. Then there does not seem to be a purpose to playing it further. However, there are a few more updates that are supposed to come out before Redigit works on Terraria 2.Overall, Teraria is more for the adventurous type of pixelated player. But don't listen to me continue rambling on! What are you waiting for? Buy the game already!			"

												:|: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :|:I enjoy Terraria for  many  different reasons.  (The updates are free)  Everything you see is destructible, which is fantastic! I love landscaping the worlds, and building awesome housing for my NPCs. It's exciting to break through a wall I could not get through before, because I didn't have the right gear/powder to remove that tier of material. The more you explore, the better equipment you can craft or  find . As well as discovering underground biomes you didn't even know the game had , and recreating them in a different location to harvest the materials or just decorate with !However, I would have to say the main reasonI like Terraria is that it's one of the most evolving games I have ever played. I started playing it shortly after release on my boyfriend's account and enjoyed it, yet felt many things just... weren't quite right. I quit for a little while because Oblivion and Skyrim had completely captured my gaming interests at that moment, and the PS3 controller is just so much easier to use. This last year I began playing more Terraria, and really I like what the developers have done with the game. It took a lot of time to adjust, and a lot of research into what had changed and how to properly manipulate everything (which I still have yet to do, but look forward to).There is a lot to learn, that is for sure, but the game is so much fun. Once you've read through a few  short, well written guides (or intro videos, easliy found online), and have found a few useful items to help you properly maneuver through the worlds of Terraria, you will likely find something that peaks your interest. Don't forget you are  not bound to the ground , there are Flying Carpets, Clouds/Storms in a Bottle, Umbrellas and Balloons that help you  fly  , as well as Wings later on . There are many goals in the game, but no exact order to complete them in. In every tier there are better materials to build & craft with & more dangerous playing areas available to you.I find something new in this game literally every day! Terraria never fails to amuse and surprise me, I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in building, landscaping, exploring dungeons, multi & single-player boss fights/mob fights, random world generaters, zombie survival, open-world sandboxes... or pretty much anything!  EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS GAME! It's worth the price, and often goes on sale.  "

												Terraria is an indie game for PC, console, and mobile devices. It was one of the first game to be inspired by Minecraft. As in Minecraft, you explore a randomly-generated world of blocks. Monsters lurk around every corner, and the only way to get ahead is by crafting more powerful items. You can explore alone or with friends, and in the course of play you'll discover a strange fantasy world of peril and wonder. This does make for a much simpler game world. But it also serves to streamline a lot of the frustrating aspects of Minecraft. One of the most stressful things about Minecraft is the way that monsters can sneak up on you, as you have a first person veiw. With flat, 2D graphics, you can see all of your enemies out to get you at a glance. One thing I also enjoyed is that items don't wear out. Although I haven't played much Minecraft myself, things wearing out after you've spent hours finding resources to craft them, doesn't sound so fun. You're even given some tools right at the beginning to start off with.Crafting options appear automatically when you have the necessary resources. When you first start out, there's a NPC standing next you who serves a guide. Talk to him, and he'll give you some basic instructions to get started. They don't expect you to trawl the wiki just to figure out what's going on. You can build houses, and fit them out with chairs, tables, and other accessories. Expanding your home is a big requirement for progression,  If you build extra rooms on your house, NPCs will spawn, selling items, and helping you along your journey.The more you progress, the tougher enemies become. The only way to cope with these ever-increasing threats is by upgrading all your gear, and it's this challenge that makes up most of the game. Your doesn't wear out, but there are so many weapon classes, and there's always just one more upgrade to buy. The world and enemies are amazing, you really do feel compelled to explore. There are so many different treasures and surprises to find.In Minecraft, and other games similar, you often reach a point where you run out things to do. Terraria fixes that problem by including bigger and bigger enemies, and more and more cool weapons to take them down. I loved how there are so many items and weapon classes, even if some of them are a bit useless. You feel like you're exploring a real place, and figuring out how everything works in this world is part of the charm. I'm not sure if I have the patience to keep burrowing until I'm crafting my own laser guns, however this game will keep you entertained for hours. The game is decently priced, and often goes on sale. With how much you get with this game, such as Steam Trading cards, Steam achievments, (Also the option to save worlds & characters to the Steam Cloud), this game offers many enjoyable hours of single player, co-op and multiplayer, and is definitely deserving a 9/10.

												Let your creativity let loose! :DTerraria is a game that requires learning in the initial hours, because after you create your character and world, you will be unaware of the dangers that'll come in the following night. The guide may hint you torwards your next objective in the some what obscure story. You progress by collecting new weapons and armor and defeating bosses but the real game starts  when you use your creativity to make buildings, monuments and just about anything the 2D universe can allow.Apart from being a procedural sandbox, this game is also a deep and intricated RPG. There is a vast number weapons, armor, potions etc. to be crafted, found or bought, which helps you fight off various and colorful enemies, mobs and bosses. By progressing through the 'story', you get access to new items, blocks, weapons and armor to play with.There is also multiplayer which allows for PvP and PvE modes, but the IP based connection may take a long time to initiate a game online. I would have enjoyed it more if there was a steamworks integration.Since it's release in May 2011, the game has recieved many updates that have not only made the game more accessable but also added tons and tons of new items to play  with. So the conclusion would be is - If you  love sandbox games, adventure games,RPGs , online games , 2D games - then this game is definitely for you. If you do not like those kind of games then you should definitely give it a try :) My rating is a 9/10			"

												While i was hesitant to pick up this game at first, it has provin to be very enjoyable.The first time i played it I was.... less then interested.Terraria is not very intuative. And I found myself wondering how to do the simplest of things.It took a while for me to get into the mechanics of the game. But after the initial noob phase I was starting to enjoy myself. I found that (and this is my personal opinion) Terraria is a lot more fun if you have someone to play with, Even if it's just every once in a while to keep things fresh and new. (and to help tackle those pesky bosses)Now with nearly 200+ hours into the game I still find myself starting it up and seeing what trouble I can get into, what new things I can build, and secrets I can discover.+edited for correct spelling+Review Update. 11/24/2016And now with the new content update theres even more fun to be had by new players and veterans alike.

												Wenn ich ehrlich sein soll..Es ist einfach nur der absolute Hammer. Dieses Spiel..welches mit solch ""begrenzten Mitteln"" ein solches Suchtpotentiel entwickeln kann ist echt nur lobenswert. Mit dem neusten  Patch ist es noch umso besser geworden. Viele neue Items, Mobs, Bosse und vieles mehr. Wer es noch nicht besitzt sollte es sich unbedingt kaufen!________________________________________________It's one of the best games I've ever played. Also one of my favorites. I'm just addicted to it. You need to play very long if you want to see everything, and exactly that is one reason why this game is just awesome. There are many other things why I love this game but I've just one thing to say: Go and get it! Explore it yourself! Now!			"

												For me, Terraria is a 2D Adventure-Story game. You start off as a simple human, overcoming many obsacles, until you can be the best dark or light magician spawning creatures to fight for you, or have the best sword currently in the game and slash stuff and be the king. You can choose your way in many ways. You can build, kill and even dig stuff. It doesn't have sotry elements, but killing the bosses one after another makes me do that by myself. The best part is this game is now alive again. It has had many updates since 1.2 which was the biggest update ever.Music - Awesome, suits the game in many ways. Favorite: Underground Mushroom Biome.Graphics - Very awesome, pixelated in a good way, the game looks much nicer in pixels than 1080p non-pixelated graphics.World Design - The backrounds are awesome as well as interacting with the world (breaking objects) makes you feel inside it.A.I. - The enemies are not stupid at all, they can see you. Amazing too.There's no story or cutscenes, because it doesn't need to. It's too much awesomeness for a game. If you're looking to buy it, please, check the 1.2 trailer on this page and you will change your mind.Terraria. Awesome game to spend your time, but better with friends.A masterpiece without the need of next-gen graphics.                                  10/10			"

Actually simplest maybe a stretch, granted the game is at first easy to learn, but to actually advance in the game you're going to need a wiki open every five seconds...but that's not necessarily a bad thing, it just proves just how much depth this game has to offer.In short, I would recommend this to anyone who loves games.

Other than that, great game with a lot of awesome stuff. HARD at first, but not boring as many people say. The problem with most of the reviews is that people focuses on graphics and things that are not really gameplay issues.			"

												*As of version 1.2.3*Terraria is one of the best selling games in the Steam store and it came out 2011.All you do is well kinda like Minecraft, mine, craft and fight but its in 2-D.Re-Logic knew that Minecraft was boring to most people and that the mobs were just to simple to kill so they decided to make a crap ton of enemies that go through walls, shoot at you, teleport to you and you know what, thats AMAZING. There is over 100 enemies to fight and there is over 10 bosses to fight so they will bring the difficult up.If you didnt notice already but if you questioned who is that girl staring at the bunny beside these words well she is the Dryad who sells nature-like things like a dirt rod, a magical rod which you can move dirt (useless). There are over 20 NPC but only 19 NPC can be in 1 world (i dont know why but go with it) and if you want them to spawn, you must complete a certain objective which you gotta ask the guide which is beside you when you 1st enter a new world. Once you completed the objective, you have to build a house thats 6X6 with a door,table,chair,walls, and a `light source`.There is a LOT of weapons to find categorized from ranged to melee and magic to summons.It is recommended that you make at least a wooden sword during your 1st play. Many of the items can be found by killing a mob. NOTE: the Slime Staff is currently the hardest item from a mob (1/10,000) and it can be dropped from the most common enemy in the game, a slime. 60% the items you need are dropped from enemies and if i were you, watch out for mimics, for they are desguised as chests but if your near the chest it will expose and lunge at you with its teeth.As you progress through the game you will need armor which if you wear a full set,you get a set bonus which is really helpful.Theres 1 problem about multiplayer and that is when you play on a new world server, many people tend to hide items that they arent suppose to have, either their too scared to actually leave their good stuff that they didnt get leget or they wanna be idiots by playing the game cheap.I give this game 9 out of 10 due to the popularity and the little greifers in the Terraria community.

												Terraria is a fun 2D game where you create your own character and explore your world. You can craft items to help you survive, battle, or build. The game is centered on defeating several tough bosses, ranging from somewhat spooky such as the giant mechanical skull, Skeletron Prime, or just silly, like the incredibly large shark/fish Duke Fishron. In order to prepare to fight these bosses, the player must find materials to craft their own gear. They'll go from makeshift wooden armor to the fabled Hallowed Armor, earning and finding weapons on the way. The game has violence in it which most of the time cannot be avoided. Finding some materials and sometimes just surviving means defending yourself against monsters small and large, ranging from floating eyeballs to surprisingly dangerous unicorns. When killed, enemies can splat pixelated blood that isn't very realistic. Most children and almost all teens can handle this. While not supposed to be a learning game, it does have some learning aspects, such as logical thinking. If I want to craft this sword, what items are most likely to make it? Besides that, it's not too inappropriate. The only other thing inappropriate in the game is that the player can craft a keg and brew their own ale and get an effect on their character called ""tipsy."" Besides this, I'd say it's good for anyone with a passion for adventure			"

												I have to say that this game amazes me technically much more than all these AAA games with photorealistic 3D graphics -- a huge world, lots of content with tons of weapons, monsters, and mobility options working in different ways. Especially that in these AAA games the world cannot be changed in any way (no destructible terrain), and they even look all the same, and in Terraria you can dig or build wherever you want, liquids are flowing, mushrooms and corruption are spreading, and so on... (Probably especially amazing in multiplayer, although I have not tried that.)The gameplay (which could be described as a platformer/sandbox hybrid -- thus, for example, you can design arenas yourself, so that you fight the bosses in a location which gives you an advantage) is very good. There are some minor design flaws, though. I dislike games where the inventory space is limited -- they are neither realistic nor fun, they only annoy the player without making the game more interesting or fun in any way (there are games when inventory limit does benefit the gameplay, like in DoomRL, Brogue or Hydra Slayer, but often this feature seems to be added without any reason). This is especially bad in Terraria, because you typically gather lots of useful crafting ingredients from each trip. It might be good for the gameplay that you have only a limited space for weapons and potions (and thus you have to plan what to take for your next fight), but I think the game would be more fun if we could collect loot without having to think about the inventory limits -- a separate limited inventory for battles, and infinite inventory for loot (which could not be used during a battle) would solve this. Another minor flaw is grinding: doing boring stuff in order to gather resources necessary to beat your next challenge is a waste of time. Some grinding is fine, but I think I would have more fun without having to go through the Lunar Cultist and all the Celestial Towers again after failing the Moon Lord fight, or having to mine for chlorophyte again and again, or waiting for the day/night to proceed, or having to spend lots of time to find rare items.

												When I first got this game on release I had very little interest in playing it.It had potential, but it wasn't very fun solo.Now, however?  After a couple years and much patching, Terraria has gone from a game with promise to a game with fully realized potential.  It features an in-depth, extensive crafting system that allows for both cosmetic and practical items.  No resources you gather are useless - you can make something out of nearly anything.  Combat is challenging and very fun.  A variety of weapons - both crafted and dropped by enemies- allows for every combat playstyle.  Yoyos? No problem. Swords? Sure. Boomerangs? You got it. Spells? Duh.  The armor and weapons that you progressively acquire really give you a good sense of achievement as you continue on through the game.Although I have found myself getting frustrated and rage quitting on some nights, the difficulty of the game only makes it more addicting.  I just keep finding myself being pulled back into the game despite dying several times in one night (depending on the activity I'm trying to participate in). Boss fights are fun and diverse, and the bosses all have really neat visual designs.  Building structures is a source of never-ending entertainment, and many different styles of building tiles are available.  The tools that are available later on in the game really add a nice touch.

												Terraria, this game may not be Crysis or Battlefield but its take on a quriky colourful art style makes it enjoyable to look at! The game can not be compared to Minecraft as it is hugely different. Terraria was the foundation for Minecraft. People who support Minecraft are just fanboys who are to afraid to admit when there precious game is beaten. Anyway enough of Minecraft I'm here to review Terraria. Straight away as you launch this game you will realise that it is not a building game and focuses on adventuring instead. There are hundreds of Boss Battles and adventuring to be had in this game. The buidling is still fun and enjoyable though so don't be put off! The Multiplayer is really fun and building and surviving with friends is where the game really shines with friends. If you haven't got this game I encourage you to pick it up wheter if it is on sale or you choose to purchase it for the $10 its worth it.			"

												Notable features:*Like a hundred weapons or something*Sound effects*Hardcore mode for those who like eternal torment*A hoverboard*A puppy*More puns than you could shake a slime at*Extremely accurate dirt physics*BeesI've spent at least 300 hours on Terraria (242 on record, but we all know how accurate that is) and darn if I don't keep coming back. Endgame is now more challenging than ever with the 'Moon events, and co-op is quick to set up if you'd rather dig/fight/explore/build with a partner or three. With lots of replayability due to the sheer amount of content in the game paired with the randomly generated worlds, this title will keep you coming back for more. At the time of writing this there are even more content updates planned. If you're one of the four people in the world that hasn't already bought Terraria, I would highly suggest you do. (If you're waiting for Starbound to be less messy and unpolished, I find Terraria works wonders as well.)			"

The servers are really lively and everyone can make friends, The Game itself has a good pve enviorment with hard bosses and hard mobs attacking your and the monsters get more difficult at each passing turn but the benefits you get is extremely fun as well. Pvp is extremely flexible and fun, the three classes and the combinations on what set you can choose makes pvp challenging and rewarding. Best thing about it, YOU DONT NEED MODS , to make this game great its just naturally great... all i have to say NERF THE TERRA BLADE RED WHY DID U MAKE IT STRONGER , WHY IN THE HEAVENS WOULD U DO THAT!

												This one looks kind of repulsive, does it not? However do not judge book by its cover. Behind the almost ugly, square like face of Terraria lies humungous world filled with adventure. Craft your own equipment and set to explore many underground layers, called biomes, each with their unique set of creatures. Gear up and face different bosses to get your hand on more exclusive materials and eventually face the final boss to push the difficulty to another level by unlocking hardmod.On second look even the graphics are not as bad as they seemed. Sure they are simplistic and really ""squary"", but when everything gets put together the image can get quite amazing, considering we are dealing with kind of a pixelart. Some sceneries are really rather breathtaking and stretch your imagination to its limits.In the end it is your imagination that is going to decide whether you are going to like Terraria or not, because the game is about putting IT to use in the first place. The adventures are only half of the game, the other half is about building whatever you can imagine and the potential of the game is almost limitless. Are you up to the task?			"

												Terraria is a 2D action-adventure sandbox indie side-scroller. You create your character and jump into a randomly generated world. You can then explore, fight, craft, and build to your heart's content. When I first played Terraria, I thought it was one of the dullest games I had ever played. But once I figured out what I was doing, learnt a few recipes, and played with some friends it became one of the most fun games I have ever played. There is no story to Terraria. You dig, mine ores, make gear, go after the next tier of ore, repeat. However, there is a ton of NPCs to meet/rescue, bosses to defeat, and plenty of creatures to kill. There's also plenty of different materials for those who love to build in games.The recent 1.2 update added a whole ton of new items, enemies, and recipes. Making an already great game even better. Overall a great game.			"

												Instead of writing a paragraph about why I recommend Terraria, I'll just put a few key points...As of the new 1.3 update:- You can ride a unicorn- You can change the colour of said unicorn- There's lots of other cool stuff but they aren't really as important as the unicorn so I'll leave you to explore and find those new additions on your own (this includes over 800 new items by the way, good luck.)

												Terraria is an exploration platformer developed by Re-Logic (Headed by Andrew ""Redigit"" Spinks and Jeremy ""Blue"" Guerrette) in March 2011. The game went through multiple updates ever since then, first culminating in the 1.1 release of December 2011 before developement ceased in February 2012. In April 2013, development continued with a promised 1.2 update that was released October 1st 2013. The game is availible on Valve's Steam platform and a console version released by 505 Studios around late 2012 is availible on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network.Gameplay: Gameplay is focused on a 2D side-scrolling playing field. Players initially start out with gathering wood from trees to erect a basic shelter for the first night. This may sound similar to Mojang AB's Minecraft but Terraria makes a more exploration turn. Even while mining, players can find underground treasure chests with unique items, accessories. Fighting your first boss of the game is where Terraria truly shows it's not any sort of Minecraft clone (even when people claims it is, Markus ""Notch"" Perrson supports the game). Players also delve into the corruption or crimson to fight the nasties hidden, a dungeon filled with skeletons, an expansive underground jungle buzzing with hornets and even beehives and the lava filled underworld as well. Even after beating a strong monster in the underworld, there's still a massive amount of content ahead that I should probably not go into detail of it all, as tempting as it is.Graphics: The graphics are appealing, much like an old SNES side-scroller along with some neat effects such as flames, smoke, rain and snow and despite it's almost cute style, it manages to be scary at the same time.Sounds & Music: The sounds are simplistic but very effective such as tinks of mining stone or using your inventory. Meanwhile the music is composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly. The soundtrack in it's 2011 days were quite limited (Title, Day, Night, Cave, Boss, Eerie) before we got more varied soundtracks come 1.1 and then even more varied music in 1.2, some of it brought over from the Console version.Goods: Very addictive that can have you playing for hours on end (if five ingame day cycles pass, you've played for two hours because that's 120 minutes). Adventurous, fun to play with friends.Bads: Some of the longetivity is caused by enemy drop rates being so low (for example, one is 0.025%) making some of the gameplay just simply killing enemies in the same general area for a hard to get item. It's also frustrating dying to a boss.Overall: It's cheap. Buy it. It's worth it.			"

												Whenever I think of writing a review for that certain game, I cannot avoid thinking of that certain game, and when I do, I end up playing that certain game and have no time for writing a review.I was only able to write this because I wasn't trying to write a review and thus could avoid thinking of that certain game.Joking aside, this game has a rewarding progression tightly intertwined with lots of creative freedom, and that's what made me surprise myself with liking this game so much. I'd not call myself a devoted gamer anymore these days, yet Terraria managed to keep me interested for hundreds of hours.It also has a difficulty progression that can not easily like in many MMOs be solved through outleveling, since there are no levels. At a certain point an unskilled player might gently bump into a difficulty barrier that poses a real challenge to overcome. The amount of preparation one might have to do for certain bosses would prompt Witcher Geralt to call you insane. ;-D But that's part of the game's interesting character.But if you can't overcome some challenges, the game is still great. You don't miss anything if you don't manage to defeat that last boss or such. Or you could also get some allies and try your luck that way.Patch 1.3 made many things even better. My personal favorite is the *ka-ching* of coin pickups.And the conveyor belts added with 1.3.1 are a delight, too.If I really try to find downsides to point out, it would be this:- Very resolution-dependent game. Higher res enlarges visible area. 1920x1080 (or x1200) is maximum. I personally prefer(red) 1280x720 so stuff isn't so small, but the game is technically problematic and if windows are open in the background and you play the game in full screen, it might resize them; cut them down to the game resolution, which is very annoying. Also, when you change the resolution in fullscreen and confirm, it doesn't change it. You have to switch to window and back to fullscreen to make it work.- UI use (e.g. item management and use), although somewhat improved, is still a bit too complicated for the amount of materials you'll accumulate after a while.Still not convinced? Then let me tell you what I did the other day: I saved the tormented soul of a tax collector in hell only to dowse him in lava and take his cane before it could melt.Good times. :-)Ever since I play Terraria I get more sextants.UPDATE: Not playing anymore because dev company♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.

												There are many many many sandbox games out there and as we all know sandbox can get boring after a little while, BUT!!!!! Terraria is different.Terraria gets you hooked the first 3 nights and makes you really look at the depth of how much stuff is out there. Tons of different armor and weapons. Hundreds of different blocks. And countless enemies to fight as darkness approaches.After a while you start getting into routine. ""Chop wood, build up house, kill slimes, explore caves..."" And when you think it gets even a little boring a message appears on your screen. ""You feel an evil presence watching you..."" Then as you are wondering what the heck that meant it attacks you unexpectantly...Bosses in sandbox games are somewhat hard to make because of the free realm and no story but Terraria does an amazing job incorporating multiple bosses that differ in difficulty to this is a challenge to IMPOSSIBLE!!!! Good job Guys!!!11/10			"

The developers are awesome and the community is great. It's easy to meet new friends and just jump in and play a game with people.  I've made over 200 YouTube videos of Terraria and it feels like I'm just getting started. You never run out of things to do in this game and I highly recommend adding this one to your collection. It's frequently on sale on steam. All in all, I would give this game a 10/10!			"

												Much like the Ford Transit, Terraria offers multipe choices including the 3.7-liter V-6, a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6, and a new 3.2-liter turbodiesel inline-five. It can contain up to 487 cubic feet of cargo space which is 75% more than in the largest E-series. Terraria might not look pretty, but with its combination of utility, fuel efficiency, and cabin comfort, I expect its customers will find it shines from within.On a more personal level, I while I find magic to be the most fun approach, it did make some boss fight like the Golem laughably easy.In short, I rank Terraria as number one Full-size Van, just slightly above the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.

												This game boggles my mind with the sheer amount of content and replayability it has. It has really become an absolute classic in the voxel-random generated gaming world.Great with friends. Pretty damn epic adventures. Very interesting bosses. Great sense of exploration. Amazing, albeit imbalanced, items and equipment. Dynamic world mechanics. Huge and enjoyable time sink.Also, stop comparing it to Minecraft! Terraria took a different creative path and succeeded in making a solid original game. Terraria is focused on the gameplay and exploration, Minecraft is focused on creation and alteration.Damn addicting game. Worth its weight in gold.			"

												Only ever played singleplayer without fighting bosses, but really enjoyed it. I like the simplicity and pacing, slowly getting stronger as you establish a little home and craft some stronger tools, expanding your knowledge of the game and collecting useful items as you explore the land and mine underground. The music is fitting, and the game itself is well made. There's plenty of depth to it offering more gameplay in multiplayer and boss fighting that I haven't even tapped into yet.			"

												I have hundreds of hours on mobile, and plan to have more here since theirs so much more. Really just such an addicting and unique game, with hundreds of enemies, tons of loot, just plainly fun items to use, and just flat out sick weapons that make combat fun. I highly recommend this but there isn't much to compare it too, you can compare it to Starbound but chances are if you have played Starbound then you have played Terraria. You can also kinda compare it to Minecraft, its kinda a more mature minecraft with less of a viewpoint on building and more on fighting.			"

												You're gonna dig this game. Literally.It has a great game vintage look and a very pleasing soundtrack, which is a very important part of a vintage game.It takes you back to the SNES games. It provides you that arcade fun that a fast paced game always delivers but at the same time, if you are that other kind of player, the one who really digs into the game, it can be something else for you.It can be very detailed on many levels since it provides you discovery, adventure, defense, building and organizing.It's not just a pretty game. It's really relaxing and makes you feel lonely, but the good kind of loneliness. The one we're all looking for in a discovery game in a big area to explore and make it your way.Playing with friends is also great but not mandatory. Still Multiplayer works very well and it's pretty simple to set things up.Wether you want to spend time or be a great explorer, Terraria delivers what a game of its genre promises. With an addendum: Beautifully.			"

												Awesome game!Given it might not look much but you will feel its elegance after you've played it.It's like minecraft in 2D except:Fighting is more emphasized in Terraria.First night time if you're caught unprepared might turn out ugly quick.It has more bosses than minecraft.More events than minecraft. (I don't think vanilla minecraft even has events like mob rain [correct me if i'm wrong coz I haven't played minecraft for a long time])Building is ok, Most of the time you build houses for your NPC's.NPC are limited yet more memorable than villagers in minecraft. (that's given)Crafting is substantial, there are lots of things to craft.There are also a lot of furnitures and accessorial blocks even a block of smore and a block of cloud. lol.Automation is ok. but I think minecraft redstone builds are better.You have mounts and wings!Guns!Chainsaws!Drills!and many more!I'm not saying that this game is better than minecraft but it's a really good game!Lucky for you if you get it on sale, but even without a sale it's cheaper than most games out there.grab it to have MAXIMUM FUN!

												I still say that eight bit is a big upgrade over seven bit, and worth every penny.Grab your yoyo, because Irreverend Opinions is taking a spin in Terraria!---The BlurbA 2D, 8-bit sandbox game with endgame content, fully editable terrain, and plenty of content.  Terraria promises quite a substantial amount, and then delivers.The GoodThe graphics are 8-bit, but not 'cheap', with quite a bit of effort having been taken for the way things appear despite the low resolution.  Character customization is substantial, allowing for players to define who they want to appear as quickly and easily.Audio is decent, though the musical score may get repetitive after a time, cycling through different tracks for day and night, as well as for the different zones; night time deserts have a different sound to daylit jungles, to the Corruption in the rain, to the Hallow, etc.Equipment is varied and expansive, with an incredible number of tasks that a player can take, and tools to cover them.  A player could play as a gun-toting ninja dungeon raider, a demon-summoning architect of marble towers, a bee hunter, a fishing enthusiast, and more.At it's core, Terraria is about exploration, and covers this with an exhaustive terrain palette, with distinct features that prevent each zone from being a cut-out copy with different color hues.  Ice is slippery, sand falls when there's nothing to support it, jungles have thorns, etc.Exploring through caverns and tunnels is pleasantly alternating, allowing for players to traverse marble halls, granite caverns, lava pits, and more.  Treasure can be found in the form of minerals to craft tools from, unique stones to build with, lost chests of gold and equipment, plants to grow, and more.  As the game progresses, changes can occur to allow the player a chance at exploring new environments that are opened with the death of a particular boss, for example.Combat styles can be broken down into a number of equally-viable groups; yoyos (thanks to their partnership with One Drop Yoyos[onedropyoyos.com]), boomerangs, summons, swords, spears, bows, chainsaws, guns, flails, bombs, spells, and crossbows.  Pickaxes, hammers, and other tools are typically less viable for combat, but can still be used in a pinch.  Different weapons allow for alternate approaches to battle, and may give benefits such as heavy knockback, lazers flying off per swing, and so forth.Monsters are diverse, from the standard 'charge in and hit' to ranged attackers, spellcasters that can teleport, flying and burrowing brawlers, debuff and damage-over-time specialists, summoners, and more.  The AI typically has monsters seeking you despite all situations, though some will run when on low health, some will stop to collect treasure, and similar.Bosses are neither standardized nor just 'harder hitting normal monsters', giving a range of single-target juggernauts, multi-target swarms, bullet-hells, and brutes for players to try whittling down, or grouping up to fight together.  Rewards typically measure up to the challenge that has been overcome, allowing for a sense of progression through the game.Construction is quite in-depth, allowing players to complete projects of giant, labyrinthine towers with a lava-filled ""eye a la Sauron"", or sprawling castles, or farming fields, and more.  A set of simple 'mechanical' tools allow for some forms of automation, and enough different forms of material texture exist to allow a discerning builder immense free reign for their expression.Setting up a server to host a multiplayer game is exceptionally simple, both for ""while online"" and ""long-running"" server styles.  Resource usage is noticeably low, allowing players to enjoy their own server without fear of disconnecting friends from half a globe away, though latency does tend to parse poorly in transcontinental multiplayer.  PvP is possible in duel, free-for-all, and team-based combat, with items spattered through that can be used for competitive games akin to variations of 'capture the flag'.Developers are both friendly and active, having made numerous updates to the game project, including cross-referencing it to their other games.The BadWhile varied, the music selection per zone is limited, so staying put for something (like construction) can lead to the sound getting quite repetitive.A steep learning curve for new players, though mitigated by a helpful 'guide' who can tell you what you can build from materials you have.Despite the wide variety of textures and models, typically weapons, armor, and tools tend to homogenize at the top tier of play, neutralizing the customization on offer.Merciless with difficulty increases (such as the hardmode plateau), which can put off players who are easily discouraged.The UglyPlayers have no choice as to taking part in certain boss fights; various bosses will spontaneously spawn and attack regardless of player activity, location, or readiness.Bosses can appear at the player spawn point, allowing them to repeatedly kill players as they enter game.SuggestionsThe developers seem to actually pay attention to their customers, and have a steady update queue.  So, can't really say much for suggestion that the team doesn't already tackle.Perhaps linking the boss spawns to a certain gear score and/or time playing.  New players will be put off by finding that they just purchased a spawn-camping simulator.The SummaryEminently playable, more fun with friends.  8/10.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												I used to play with Lego a lot as a child. Just, piles and piles of the stuff, and I'd build things which, to be honest with myself, were probably quite rubbish. But I lost myself in these worlds, where the possibilities were endless and I could keep playing and playing and playing...As I grew older, life started hitting back. My Lego got dusty. There were moments, when younger family came round, when the Lego would come out and I'd look at and wish I could have that feeling again - I felt like I would never really have that childlike immersion in something again because my brain is filled with useless things like how taxes work and how to open a bank account.Terraria solved that. I get so distracted in this game, there's so much stuff I want to do, and so much stuff to do. I love the freedom and I love the fact that there are bosses and quests to do but they're not shoved down your throat. There are elements of kookiness (the Hallows) and elements of seriousness (the Wall of Flesh, the Crimson) and nothing beats stumbling on some new area and thinking ""I wonder if I can use these things to make a suit of bees?"".It's a fantastic game, well worth full price, and definitely recommended jamming with friends.And yes, you can make a suit of bees. And fire a bee gun.			"

If you're looking for a good game you can sit and play for awhile this is the game to go to. You can play the game, progress and stop... Or you can do what me and my friends did and play around, build amazing houses, chalange yourself with multipul bosses and cool arena's. Its all around a great sandbox game that i play all the time, Now if you""ll exuse me im gonna go play terraria!			"

												This game is like Legos on crack. The old-school SNES visuals are pure nostalgia, while the complexity and depth of the overarching mechanics provide surprisingly huge entertainment value.

												After more than 500 hours I think its time I write a review for this game.The begining may seem stale at first, but as you progress the game will get more interesting.Pros:-High replay value-It has something for everyone (Building, Action, Exploring, Mining, Character customization, Farming, and even fishing)-It has Multiplayer-Large community-Strong end game content-Biomes are very diverse-Thousands of different items to use-Many enemies and bosses-Expert Mode for anyone up for a challenge and more lootCons:-Grinding/farming for items is very time consuming-The transition to Hardmode might be difficult for newer players-Random Events can be annoying Invasions, Blood Moons, Solar Eclipses-The flame war between Terraria and Minecraft (Stop arguing over two completely different games)-Forums plagued with players asking for free stuff			"

												one of the best games ive ever played! It never gets boring, whether you're just starting out or you're going for the final boss. The mechanics of the game are fantastic, and there is always something to do. 150+ hours of great fun guaranteed (if you want). It's also incredible to play with friends- the servers are easy to set up, and using a port forwarding app like Hamachi means you can play within a minute of setting up. TOP GAME =)			"

												My favorite sandbox-building game.It is sandbox, but it has progress.It is not an RPG, but there are bits and pieces that feels like it's a world.Game play ramps up in difficulty in right amounts but you can always make it harder by jumping in Expert mode (with better rewards, too!).Multiplayer is also a lot of fun and the way the game plays out, laughter and teamwork spirit is guaranteed. Or adrenaline, if you are into pvp! >: DThe variety is incredible and the developers are amazing.To this day, they've been supporting this game.It also has a great community.Seriously, if you like these types of games, you must be ashamed not to have played it.If you want to get in the genre, it is an ideal game to start.

												[Review originally written in 2014. I'll make a proper update another day]Some people say that Terraria is a 2D Minecraft. That's NOT true. Minecraft is a completely different game (and isn't even close to be fun as Terraria). Anyay, Terraria is a 2D Sandbox (Craft 'em up)/Platformer/RPG game where you start with nothing but a cooper sword, a cooper axe and a cooper pickaxe, 100 HP and in the new version, 20 mana. But as you dig more and collect more ores and cool stuff and craft them, the game turns you from hunted to hunter. It's not only about mining. (Sure, mining is essential, but you don't have to be always looking for ores, as they're not rare at all and the crafting recipes are pretty simple (as the crafting system). If you get stuck anytime, the Guide can help you out.The game is really slow paced at the beggining, but as you get stronger, it can surprise you with it's fast paced PVP, party system, bosses and enemies. You can have weapons from bows and shurikens to flametrowers and the craziest guns ever made!It also lets you pick your character's difficulty, which can be: Easycore (You drop some coins on death), Mediumcore (You drop your items on death) (i don't recommend playing on mediumcore), and Hardcore (when you die... you die), but not the game's difficulty. You begin without armor and easily die in most places and at night, then you get stronger and find a harder place, then you get stronger again and find a more challanging place, then you get EVEN stronger... and after you kill the ""last"" boss, your world is instantly converted to a Hardmode world, which has more biomes, bosses, ores, items and difficulty. Some enemies require only skill to beat, as your set doesn't matter, they WILL kill you if you are careless.Dig, fight, explore, build, shoot, craft, find cool stuff and enter the awesome world of Terraria!!!===============================================================[Review originalmente escrita em 2014. Vou atualizá-la propriamente algum outro dia]Algumas pessoas dizem que Terraria é um Minecraft 2D. Isso NÃO é verdade. Minecraft é um jogo completamente diferente (e não chega nem perto de ser divertido como Terraria). De qualquer forma, Terraria é um jogo Sandbox (Craft 'em up)/Platformer/RPG em 2D onde você começa com nada mais que uma espada de cobre, um machado de cobre, uma picareta de cobre, 100 HP e na nova versão, 20 MP. Mas à medida que você cava mais e coleta mais minérios e coisas legais e as fabrica, o jogo te transforma de caçado para caçador. Não se trata somente de minerar (Claro, minerar é essencial, mas você não precisa estar sempre procurando por minérios, já que eles não são tão raros e as receitas de fabricação são bem simples (assim como o sistema de fabricação). Se você ficar preso a qualquer hora, o Guia pode te ajudar.O jogo tem um ritmo bem lento no começo, mas à medida que você fica mais forte, ele pode te surpreender com seu ritmo rápido de PVP, sistema de party, chefes e inimigos. Você pode ter armas de arcos e shurikens até lança-chamas e as armas mais loucas já feitas!O jogo também te permite escolher a dificuldade do personagem, que pode ser: Easycore (Você dropa algumas moedas quando morre), Mediumcore (Você dropa seus itens quando morre) (eu não recomendo jogar no mediumcore), e Hardcore (Quando você morre... você morre), mas não a dificuldade do jogo. Você começa sem armadura e facilmente morre na maioria dos lugares e à noite, então você fica mais forte e encontra um lugar mais difícil, então você fica mais forte denovo e encontra um lugar mais desafiador, então você fica AINDA mais forte... e depois de matar o ""último"" chefe, seu mundo é instantaneamente convertido para o modo ""hard"", que tem mais biomas, chefes, minérios, itens e dificuldade. Alguns inimigos só necessitam de habilidade para vencer, já que seu set não importa, eles VÃO te matar se você for descuidado.Cave, lute, explore, construa, atire, fabrique, encontre coisas legais e entre no incrível mundo de Terraria!!!

												BEST GAME  EVER---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This Has to be my favorite game on my PC. From fighting the Eyeball Of a Monster to Slaying the Lord of the moon, This game can get you addicted in mere seconds of gameplay. 3000 items makes it even better, including the weapons and tools, such as the final Prism that shoots light, to a portal gun straight from the game, mechanics and all. If you haven't gotten it yet, I recommend you buy it now. 1.3, The Final Update.In this version, the golem is now broken and torn up, and you think you're safe, however a new pressence sends you back to the dungeon to meet the cultists. They seem harmless, until you see they're worshipping a mysterious god. After you kill all 4 Cultists, The Ancient Cultist is summoned. Beat him, and terror breaks out. You must destroy the 4 Celestial towers with new weapons you will find, such as Daybreak and Nebula Blaze. In order to break the power that shields the towers, you must slay 100 (150 for expert) of their individual monsters. Then, you can damage,  then soon destroy the towers. When you thought that was hard, you're going face to face with the lord of the moon, the reason for the chaos and evilness of this realm. After a long and hard battle, you'll be seeing a flash of white as he decays into nothing but bones, and, with special loot too, you've beaten the game, destroyed all evil, and saved Terraria. And with that, you can live without Chaos and be in peace...                                                                                         ~~~THE END~~~			"

												I really had no interest in this genre of game before I played. Luckily for me, Terraria showed me that not not all sandbox adventures are Minecraft clones. I played with friends who were a mix of battle hardened veterans, and dirt covered noobs (myself included), but we quickly learned the value of having a group, and enjoyed the experience of constructing a small town with elaborate and unique houses, digging to the center of the earth, being attacked by a wide variety of deadly foes, and ultimately unleashing hell upon our little world. Playing alone was equally satisfying, as the game offers a wide variety of things to keep yourself occupied with, but I still recommend finding friends to experience Terraria with. The beauty of the sandbox genre is being able to share your creations with others, and Terraria offers hours of just that.10/10 "

												Terraria is for me one of the best 2D voxel-base game. The reasons I like it, is that the combat systeme is nice, there is sooooo much monster and stuff to craft that, you'll need at least 100 hours to get everything (maybe I was slow or unlucky^^). However it might get boring for people who doesn't like to mine for hours to get armors, tools and weapons. In conclusion, it's really good game with a big lifetime compared to it's price, and it's multiplayer. So what are you waiting to buy it :D ?!			"

Product received for free
												First of all I want to make clear something: I really liked the soundtrack at the opening. Now you may begin to read the review.Terraria is a sandbox adventure game, where your main objective is to survive. You'll start with 3 useful tools in single player: Godly Copper Shortsword, Massive Copper Pickaxe and a Chopper Axe. You can change your character, like the style of your clothes and hair and also the character name. You can decide the map size, there are three different sizes: Small, Medium and Large. And also you can choose up to two different difficulties in the game: Normal and Expert. The game lets you craft lots of contents with the workbench you can make on the inventory menu. If you die, you won't lose your full inventory only things like: silver coins. After these standard things of sandbox from above, I started to swing with my axe hoping to cut a tree, but it didn't work like Minecraft. Apparently you needed to wait several seconds more than the game. But if you cut down one place of the three, the whole tree will fall down so you get the woods faster than Minecraft. So when I had like hundred ten wood I started trying to craft some things, but for it I needed to find the inventory menu. Like I said it isn't the same as Minecraft. So I've pressed tons of buttons to find out how to make a workbench, but I couldn't find it. I looked online on a guide of Terraria to find an answer, after I found the button to craft; esc I died of a zombie. Because it was already dark. I spent several minutes to make a house to survive the nights. After I made a house I started searching unexplored areas and found some treasures. I started turning back to my house, when it was almost dark. I started crafting several of craft able items and began to become a true legend. I still died most of the times. My pc crashed and needed to start all over again, but 10/10 I'll start all over again. But in expert mode.My impressions of the game so far. The game starts boring, but later when you understand how to play it starts to become fun. The game made me clear to say this: the game isn't (almost) the same as Minecraft. The Pros and Cons of the game. Pros. - Lots of different creatures- Lots of different blocks- Lots of items to craft- Amazing gameplay- Lots of caves to explore- Admirable soundtrack- Many bosses- Has trading cardsCons. - The game has sometimes starting up problems on my pc  The game is totally worth it even without any discounts.

												Hehe, I keep hearing Minecraft clone alot, meaning really not much thought.If any out there who hung out some in the Arcades,plus experiencing a fair number of Game Consoles, then you'd truly know.In a nutshell, Terraria is a 35+ year compilement of the 2-D Gaming Engine.Review update (chopped down 1st tree in 1.3.1):Folks, you gotta buy and get into this game...sale or not, for soo much additional content, I find this game is undeniably one of the best 2-D games I've ever played...period. I cannot decide which part of the game is ""better than this area"" ...I cannot seem to pick a favorite.As for the Team at Re-Logic, this player cannot thank you enough; having the latest 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 additional content updates are uber wow factors; the frequent bug fixes itself are evident that the Devs really and truly put their hearts into this game....so, when's 1.3.5...? xD			"

Updated review:ConsWe cannot load old saves anymore because of the updates, but worst: these old saves (worlds + chars) are completely gone from the folder. Yes, gone. That means farewell to hundreds of hours spent on hard work. I had lots of fun and great times with friends building mansions, landscapes and some few masterpieces of architecture. Now, all I have left are memories and screenshots.If you kept your saves in another folder though, you can still find some fixes via third-party softwares found on the web, but until when will they work?Below is the old review of mine from 1st January 2014 and it still applies:ProsTerraria is a little wonder, a must have if you're a fan of Minecraft or Ace of Spades. You build whatever you want and the way you wish, get amazing creatures as pets, and have fun with people you meet and the evil slimes you beat, too.Conclusion:A great game, but don't buy it unless you're sure to cope with big updates, which inevitably means future loss of data and personal time, and frustration.

Where am I? oh wait....a forest..... and a tree.... can I cut it down? niceee...... if I go this way? oh♥♥♥♥♥♥what is th- "" Over all : 7.7/10This is the second game by far of my review, hope this help you decide or what not to play this game, so MOVE ALONG!What is Terraria?ehem..... okay... Terraria is a 2D side scroll adventure-ish sand-boxed RPG game! (really it is!)simple enough by traveling through world up,side ways and mostly... downward. Also Fighting monsters and discovertons of loot.... surely you can solo this or with your freinds,how cool is that!So? Anymore detail?Sure it is! Terraria gave you quiteeee a frustration at first about hints. For every detail there's a price.And for the first 20 minutes of the game I have to search the info from the community ASAP to understandof ""WHAT THE HECK IS THIS GAME AND WHY ARE WE PLAYING THIS?"". Soon the first and the biggest -CON suddenly showed up."" Fustrations ""As I progress through the game, it tells you to start build a house with a wall.... you gather NPC and more. But in some point its still lag of something.... I can't fight or move anywhere left or right. Because the monster are too strong! Sowe need to improve the character. This part of thinking makes 2 group of people.1.Meh! Boring! I quit because I don't understand what is going on and I don't want to.... -/Ran to DotA22.What is this game? Can I be stronger? Can I upgrade my gear? Is there a Boss? -/Desperately gather more infoThis is where my terraria start.... yes it's time for adventure!So.... I really want to play this game! What now?Wiki is your friend!  cause the game don't tells you everything... but there's a good random events and boss along the way. Not too much, not too boring. Aim for your equipment and boss fight! TONS OF EQUIPMENT!This is where the fun begins, you want a sword? There you go! You want a Rifle? There you go!! You want to be a wizard? There you go!!! You can be and adventure Almost every stance that you can find suits your play-style in terraria but you have to put up with it......As soon as your Hunt the first boss down.... you want more! and more!!So..... Basicly this game is?+It's a RPG game, with lots of weapons, Gears, Funny stuff and Boss to choose from! +You can play solo or with your friend!+You think this game is too easy? Try moderate! or HARDCORE! this mode are only for the REAL HERO!+There's no realdeal story here, but it's still fun to play and progress are along the way while you play. don't worry.Ahuh.... I might interest in this game...OKAY! now let's review other stuff that's not a game then!GRAPHICS SOUNDS AND OTHER STUFF-2D Flat.... Woman cc are Flat.... Spectacular retro 2D graphics with rich pixelated enviroment.-Not laggy, Smooth game play and support for co-op, can sometimes be ram-eater for your PC.-dedicated server and mods, also 8 people playable. or maybe more!-Controls are understandable, modifyable and user's friendly.-Sounds are lovely done. Even the boss theme!SO yeah.... overall I've played this game until the last boss. and I would  say It's a good co-op game I'ven't met once in a while!hope this Review gave you some ideas.... annnnd Cheers for now!

												If you're a fan of sandbox games, platformers, as well as some RPG progression, then this should be right up your alley.It isn't really a 2D Minecraft, as it places a lot more emphasis on combat and character progression rather than Minecraft's exploration and building. Sure, you can build a stylish base if you want (and it can be incredibly fun with a bit of imagination), but if you find that kind of thing boring, the game also has a lot more depth than just building. I find the combat a lot more fun, because rather than just a sword and a bow that only comes in one flavor, you've got magic items, guns, boomerangs, and several other different kinds of weapons that I really feel keeps combat fresh. Also, by endgame, you're so OP that it's hilarious to just watch everything around you burn. The multiplayer, while hard to set up at first, is also a blast. Who wouldn't want to beat up baddies with your buddies?Oh, and the music's great too. I've always loved good game musicThat being said, it's not perfect. There are still a couple problems with it, but they're just my opinions. First up, the game can feel a little bit too grindy at points, especially with the endgame loot. Some of the ultimate weapons are locked in chests, and require drops that are a 1/2500 chance to drop. (It was previously 1/8000... roughly about the chance of finding a SHINY POKEMON) I won't spoil much else though. Another problem I have is that after you beat all the bosses and become that ultimate one man army, there's not much else to do besides building and PVP. But hey, it was a fun ride there.So where am I going with this? Well, first for you TL;DR people (You know who you are), I'll just list the pros and cons.PROS   +The game has a lot more depth besides just buiding and exploring   +The various weapon types keep combat fresh and interesting   +The world, while not infinite, has a lot of different types of environments to explore   +When building, there are a lot of thematic options to choose from, as well as a lot of options to decorate your buildings   +Multiplayer is a lot of fun   +You can choose exactly how punishing you want death to be (Lose half of your money, lose all of your inventory, lose your character outright)   +The music is so awesome CONS   -Can get a little grindy, especially for endgame loot   -After you defeat all the bosses and are fully geared up, there isn't much else to doAll in all, Terraria is one of my favorite games on Steam, and you should give it a try if my first sentence applies to you.If there's anything I left out, I'll edit this as more things come to me.

												I must say that at first glance, I expected absolutely nothing from Terraria, boy was I wrong.When you look at it as a simple game where you just build stuff and kill mobs, it really doesn't seem interesting, but when you actually put time into discovering what it really offers, boy oh boy does it have TONS of content.I bought Terraria expecting it to be somehow like Minecraft (who didn't at first?), and I never really touched it until some of my buddies invited me to play with them. As I expected, we ended up only building houses and mining, I got bored quickly and stopped joining the server after a while.When I saw that Terraria had a new update, the 1.3 update, I asked myself ""Why not?"". And then it started.I put so much time into this game, building, discovering, mining, killing stuff, exploring, and I'm really sad to say that I think I might actually be done with it after 200 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fishing quests.Terraria has so many things it can offer, inclunding many hours of fun, I totally recommend this to anyone who has enough patience to spend a lot of time digging.

												This is by far one of the most enjoyable games I own. At only $10, it's a steal for the amount of replayability that the game offers.Co-op with friends offers countless hours of fun, as you explore the randomly generated world, fight interesting and dangerous creatures, and collect better equipment in an effort to constantly improve yourself for the bosses. It's one of those games that really makes time fly by. One look at the clock after playing this, and you'll wonder where your day went to.Terraria is one of the best Indie games that I know of for building structures. The amount of freedom that it gives the player to be as creative as they want in house design is truly amazing, and the structures that can be built are virtually limitless. Want to make a fully underwater headquarters? Easy. Or are you the type that likes to build a sprawling land fortress that's heavily defended with traps? You can do that too. Or perhaps a space station is more your style? Go for it.All in all, this game easily deserves a 10/10. With co-op adventuring, building, and fighting, you'd be silly not to invest the $10 and have this game in your library.			"

												Re-did-review-Quick Review-Terraria is probably one of the best games I ever purchased on steam. It's a creative sandbox game that lets you collect, place, hoard items, upgrade, play different styles, explore, dig, burn in lava, fly around, get murdered, get killed by eyeballs, get eaten by worms, and have an amazing time with friends of any gaming experience online, or just play single player! -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You're still reading? I thought by now you'd have concluded ""this game is amazing because Atratzu said so. I'll get it right now and stop reading his review. I'll even forget to click the thumbs up button for all the writing he does"".I'm just filling space, there's not really much of a story to Terraria, you start in a world and need to make shelter and then build more houses for your townsfolk (NPC's) to spawn in. You can interact with the npc's each one does something different. Learn to be good friends with your guide, and you'll do just fine.Game Play: The controls are pretty straight forward, a little difficult to explain in words. you need select tools to pick up certain blocks. Hammer for backgrounds, pickaxe for blocks, axe for chopping down tree's... there is a range of how many blocks you can reach, but most people can figure that out for themselves. If you can't... I'm sorry.You can carry some accessories, armor, and then you have an inventory. It's very straightforward and basic. A lot of the fun of the game is discovering how to use the various items you get. Some items are vanity items, other go ""pew pew"" (I wish a gun someday would literally say ""pew pew"" for me)There's a strong sense of progression in the game, it's very gear based and as you progress different gear has different effects, some lets you have more mana, some makes you tanky, some makes you move faster. Want to know more? check out the wiki-page or get the game already. Achievements: Achievements have been added, however I haven't started working on them yet. (I realized there were achievements as of 07/20/15.Price: Terraria is $9.99 that might put people off, which is fine I didn't buy the game full price I got it on a 75-50% off sale. but even if I had payed full price I have now put over 500 hours into the game. The only games that I've played more than that are Minecraft, Guild Wars 2, and World of Warcraft.So for me, it was a huge deal and value to get this game. For others it might not be so great, or put as much time into it. Conclusion: I really don't have anything negative to say about this game. I do get tired of people saying ""it's like minecraft on 2D"". Even I said that in my first review... but if you play the game a lot you see more differences then similarities. I recommend this game to anyone who is creative, or even if all you did was play with LEGO's as a kid I recommend this game. The only people who might be put off by this game, would be people who are used to having always-high-action (example would be FPS-only Genre).------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August, 9 2015: Requested edit: ""You can make male genitalia out of obsidian too.""  Edit/Update July, 20 2015:Added update about achievements (need another update later, when i start working on the achievements)			"

												I bought terraria 1 day before the 1.3 come. I was so addicted to this game! Me and three friends made the four ""heroes"" of the game and got the end-game with about 80 hours. That was so fun! I just loved the feeling of dying for a pink slime, kill a single ""Monster"" and get a mount and die without oxygen for check inventory under water and now, i'm tanking the Moon Lord. It is simply amazing to see how a simple game can be more fun and perfect than any other. Simply the bestThank you for this awesome game Developers.10/10 ♥			"

												Terraria is a very fun game.It combines some aspects of sandbox, RPG, and general free-roam exploration. Especially if you choose a large world size, the world can take so long to explore. You can make multiple characters (with RGB color customization!!!), each with their own special names, make multiple worlds and play any character on any world, with three world sizes, and literally over 2,000 different things, let it be enemies, items, blocks, events...there's so much to do. Over a DOZEN bosses, two modes, three difficulties.I have two characters, I've played over 200 hours, and have not even explored half of each world, and not even CLOSE to getting all the best of the best items. Once you've defeated all the bosses, then they'res two more events to summon, the Frost Moon and the Pumpkin Moon, each with waves and the absurdity of fighting MULTIPLE BOSSES AT ONCE. Of course, absurd in a good way.Vanity exists, so you can have awesome armor but look like an archaeoligist or a wizard, dye yourself different colors (with some special multicolor/changing dyes), and more.Unlike some other good games, Terraria has a little built-in wiki. Several, actually, the foremost being the Guide, the first NPC you get. He can tell you how to craft things, unlike (sorry to bag on it) Minecraft, in which, if there was no wiki, you'd be CLUELESS as to what to make and how to use it and such. The guide will literally tell you EVERY RECIPE AN ITEM IS USED IN, and where it is crafted at. There's so much stuff, over a dozen biomes, and.....this is a beautiful game. 10/10			"

												I haven't written a review on this until now for some reason, but my kids love this game. And I have fun playing it with them. It's kind of like Minecraft turned into a sidescrolling 2D world. Kind of. But it's really a thing all its own. You build a home, a fortress, a village, whatever you want. You craft all sorts of crazy items, armor, and weapons. There are a lot of decorative features you can make for your place, and the developers seem to be adding a lot of content. When you get tired of doing this or that, you can do more and more, and then you can unlock hard mode which changes your world in significant ways... or not. My kids like to make a homebase on one world, then create new worlds to explore and mine together. I guess we have made something like Starbound with our imaginations only without any space travel. There are a few bosses to fight if you are looking for a challenge, and it seems like there's always something more to do. I'm not sure how it would hold up if you played to do and beat everything, because the worlds aren't all that big, but if you are looking for a fun leisure activity to do with your kids, give it a try. Check out the graphics before you do, and make sure they're okay with you. Check out the wiki to learn how to make and do different things. I don't think you'll regret your decision if you do get it.			"

												This game scratches an itch I didn't know I had.  At first I only played 30 mins or so and got bored, not knowing what to do or what fun lay in store.  When I came back to it a few months later, determined to give it a go, I got hooked and spent the entire weekend and a few more weeks after work playing.  Which caused my carpal tunnel to flare up, so I had to stop playing for a bit.  While waiting for hands to get better I watched Let's Play videos for it.  I never watch Let's Play videos.   So short story - can't get enough of this game.  If you don't know much about Terraria, read a starter guide if you don't have a clue what to do.  But then don't read too much and spoil the surprises, just explore, build, mine and hack your way through the rest of the world.			"

												I have absolutely zero interest in Minecraft and haven't done much research on Terraria, but I do know it was a 2D version of what 3D Minecraft is. I have yet to reach Terraria's full potential but from what I see so far, I'm liking it. I'm warning my reader, very easily can you spend a bunch of time playing this game. Why? You can literally make a stairway of dirt to the sky, you can dig to the deepest of the lows, and you can walk continuously left or right to see where the world takes you. Terraria is a splitting of Minecraft. Almost anything can be picked or chopped away at resulting in gaining a resource. For example, you can dig away at a stone, clay, or dirt block and add it to your inventory. With this, you can determine the topography of the immediate surroundings. Don't want a house above ground? Dig a nice big hole, put some wood or stone surrounding the hole or even dirt to find the altitude you want everything at. Besides building with resources, the player can place work benches to construct additional material. What's additional material? It can be weapons, can be armor, can be torches to light up a path for your player at night, can be campfires to heal your player, can be walls made out of cacti, train track for your mining cart, tables, chairs, or antiques that make your house look pretty. It is pretty insane considering the amount of control and combinations that are in this game. I feel like I can literally do anything and go anywhere. There is, of course, exceptions to this. The further you travel from your spawn point, the harder the enemies become as well as the terrain. Random enemies will spawn throughout the game such as walkers or flyers, but at night, zombie looking creatures will come and attack you consistently. The enemies although a welcomed feature, can get pretty annoying after spending a lot of time fighting them. I personally find them numerous and annoying at times, especially when I'm building or cutting something. Traveling to different areas of the game yield different resources. The background/drop will change relative to your position on the map. I also have to add that the way they organized the characters and the worlds is fascinating. I've never had a head-ache free experience with something as similar as this. If you'd like to create a new character but use an old world, you can. If you want a new world with an old character, you also may do that!Graphics are decent and aren't meant to be anything substantial. The artists did a good graphical representation of everything, so it's somewhat difficult to confuse a stone block with an iron block. I did like the fact they added different locations as you progress the map, and the fact they added a day and night scheme. The backgrounds are dynamic and will change over time, even if it is the same background. Sounds are decent. You might go crazy after picking away at your 100th dirt block (*click *click *click). All in all, it's a pretty good game with a lot to do. You will easily find yourself immersed in this sandbox game trying to collect whatever you can get your hands on. Though the premise is cool and the game play, I've had some friends have a hard time get into the game.RATING : 7.35/10The price is reasonably fair but I would recommend a buy on sale.Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BScreenShots :  What my first home looks like. Living the dream living in a rock/dirt house "

												I've played many, many different games in the sandbox genre, but none of them have killed time for me like Terraria has.Yes, not even Minecraft.I'm sure there are people out there with way more hours on Terraria than I do, but I've been playing it for barely half a year and I've racked up over a thousand hours and I don't consider myself a hardcore gamer in the slightest. It's just that addictive, and for good reason too.The special thing about Terraria is that it isn't too focused on either being a sandbox game or an RPG. It's equally balanced in both aspects and that's what makes it so good. With hundreds of different monsters to fight, thousands of items to collect and infinite options on what you want to do in the game, it's not unusual that it still has a loyal playerbase after so many years.The single player experience is by no means bad. The game itself has more than five years worth of dedicated development put into it and the amount of content it presents for its price is very surprising. Even now, the developers of Re-Logic are still working to create new updates for Terraria. However, while the game by itself is sufficiently enjoyable, the multiplayer experience is what puts the crown of sandbox games on Terraria. Playing with friends or simply playing on public servers online with people you don't know is just that much better than exploring a world on your own. I had barely played an hour of single player before going out to find servers to play on.Like Bukkit is to Minecraft, tShock is to Terraria. This server software greatly enhances gameplay, whether you're a server Administrator or a normal player. There are many other mods out there, of course, which you can also download and install to add even more content to the game. Most servers have plugins and addons to make them significantly different from one another. If you're looking for something to play with friends or even find friends with, multiplayer Terraria is for you!Whether or not you decide to buy this to play with other people, it's still a really great game on its own and it does go on sale very often. If you're a little short on cash and don't feel like paying $10, just wait till a seasonal Steam sale or a promotion on a third party site. Terraria is still very much worth paying full price for, though!			"

												As you can tell by my logged hours, I barely have time to write a review. Even after almost 7.5k hours I still love it. You can change your goals daily or hourly. Build all types of armor. fill chests with gold, silver, adamantine, Chlorophyte... collect all the swords the game has to dish out. rack up all the spell books.  Dig holes all the way down. build stairs to the heavens. conquer all the bosses, battle epic waves of goblins, snowmen, pirates, jackolanterns and elves. Look out for Santa NKI. Whew.  build a mosh pit to help fend off all the attackers. burn them up with lava, spears, spikey balls and flame throwers. I haven't even made a mine cart yet, maybe tomorrow....With all this said. it is very important to take time for family, eat occasionally and do a great job at work.			"

												I'll admit, the game was pretty unimpressive when I first started. I chopped down trees, dug some stone, did some crafting, made a house, and fought off monsters at night. Sound like another game you've played? Well after the first hour or two, you'll forget you ever considered this game a 2-D Minecraft. There's enough content to keep you playing for hours upon hours, day and night. I often find myself playing this game for twelve hours straight at a time without realizing it. Every element of this game was made with the intent of grabbing your social life by the throat and stomping it on the ground. Highly, highly recommended. (And better than Minecraft by miles.)			"

												""It's Just 2D Minecraft!""  Said all the minecraft fansAlthough it may seem like that at first it really isn't instead it's better the amount of things you can do and places that you can explore for example all the different types of biomes above and undergroundAlso the amount of weapons is amazing you can get from swords to miniguns or star cannons you can either find the materials to make the weapons or you could buy it from some of the many NPC's in the game like the Merchant or the Gun DealerThere are many blocks also in the game building blocks or just the natural blocks some look quite nice you might even want to put it on your houseSwimming.......Sadly you can't swim without an item so most of your deaths will probably come from drowning if you fall in to a pitHard ModeThere are many boss fights even before hardmode e.g Skeletron or The Eye Of Cythulu but the big boss (The Wall Of Flesh) sends you into hard mode which will make many new Creatures and NPC's spawn that you will have never seen before and making certain recipies craftable since some of the things you need will be in hard modeOverallThis is a great game a definetly recommend this although it does get quite repetetive once you have completed it9/10			"

												I never wanted to buy this because I thought it was just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥2D Minecraft” but boy was I both ignorant and wrong. My brother kept insisting I try it and eventually I did. I can honestly say now that I regret what I said about Terraria, it’s a really great little sandbox game. There is a lot you can do in this game and it can keep you entertained for a good long while. Whether you want to build things, kill things, collect thing, find things or even just explore, there is a lot of hours to be played on this game.They have added quite a few really big updates to this game that gave end-gamers something more to do, which I think was really awesome. My brother literally loves this game; he finished everything and built a massive mansion with millions of chests containing a full stack of every time in the game.  Absolutely tanked the game and they added in a few massive updates and now he has ten times as much more to do now.So for it to still be growing, I think is a selling point a lot of people appreciate.It’s a lot of fun and is something simple and easy to play on your own or with friends.One of the best side scrolling games I have ever played.

												Terraria, a lovely game. I find it very relaxing at least when compared to competitive online games like DOTA. That's not to mean there is no challenge either.dig, craft, find, adventure, fight, build.....My only issue would be that it's hard to find people willing to play their character exclusively with you. What I mean by exclusively ? Well someone that will play with you with his character and not play the same character on the side & come back to play with you with uber equipement, because in this game, everything is tied to equipement so hard monsters/bosses will become a piece of cake once you reach higher and higher equipement level.Also still getting updates as of 2016, 5 years of continuous updates & free content updates that other games would probably add as DLC.

												It's the best game ever...Had it on the Xbox 360 and PS4, on both about 3-400 hrs of gameplay, now on PC also about 200hrs of gameplay, and the building-survival factor keeps it going on.There are so many different building materials, and equipables and items to collect, so it keeps you busy for the next couple of months if you're really up for collecting everything :)I stopped playing on the console on 1.2.4 because I had done about everything, and since I heard about the 1.3.3 update, and the new NPCs I really take a big time enjoying fishing a lot in this game.Not purely before the crates or the quests, but the quests add a different perspective to the game, and it's sometimes just nice to kill some time catching some fish :)I also like that most of the useable stuff is placeable, like swords can go into racks, and armour on mannequins.There's literally so much to explore that I could write an essay about what's there to do in Terraria, but then I'll be here in two days still typing this review.If you have to ask me, I recommend Terraria to everyone, because it's a game for everybody :)(P.S. you can also play with different classes :) )			"

												I like this game. I like it alot. I'll tell you why.Don't listen when people say it's 2D minecraft. It's a wildly inaccurate statement. It's great because of it's (If I'm using the right word, hell if I'm not) voxel-based world. You can create, explore, and destroy, and the only limit is your willingness to put forward the effort. This game allows you to be rather expressive with your imagination; given, this game shines as a co-operative game for dungeon crawling, fighting all sorts of beasties, and building massive strongholds. Definitely a bit more fantasy-action based than minecraft.This game definitely holds your attention for awhile.Tl;dr version:Lots of things to do, things to fight, weapons to find, lovely game.			"

												Terraria is not 2D minecraft.If you're looking for a minecraft-like game, don't buy this. If you're looking for a semi-difficult open world sandbox game, this is just right for you. It does have a few very minor bugs, none of which are game breaking, at the worst exploitable. The combat is not great, but the variety of weapons are in the hundreds. This is easily a 200 hour game. I also took a look at the negative reviews just to see what people had to say, and 99% of people who had negative reviews had played the game for less than 2 hours. They did not experience the game to the fullest. This was the first game I ever bought on Steam and I have >100 hours in on it now. I think anyone can enjoy Terraria.			"

Go to the Terraria wiki and just leaf through the pagesIf you begin to play without this process, You wont be able to enjoy every content of Terrariaand you might be stuck at some point because you dont know what to do4. Play female character, You could hear sexy moanings			"

												One of the best games for newbies to Steam, does get quite mundane though. The art is great and so is this music, character customization does seems a bit lacking. If you like this, grab Starbound as of the time of this (update to the) review it was released as a full game. The game is also moddable! I highly recommend it.			"

												After playing 32.6 hours and more off-line, I have to say this is by far the best game I've ever played in my life. There's so much to do in so little-time. What I mean by that is that when you start-off the game you only have a certain amount of time to do things before it hits the night. When that happens, that's where the fun begins. I can go on for hours on why I think this game is awesome, but if you like adventure, crafting, beating bosses....Then this is game is for you and the best part is that the devs keep this game fresh and clean with updates. -- Don't take my word for it, buy it and play it!!!! Happy Gaming & Have Fun!!!			"

												After you hear this review, just buy the game. now. I have almost 1,700 hours, Its a great game, I started back when the game was still in 1.1, when the Twins were everyones demize, and Hallowed Armor was the best armor, I thought the game was good back then, well, its even better,  I am gonna review the game.Over hundreds of hours of fun, achievments, trading cards, multiplayer fun,  and more.  Also by the way, a fun fact, Terraria was rleased to the public as a beta before Minecraft, just look up Terraria and Minecraft and see the dates on wiki. You can do basically everything. Its just fun, buy it!			"

												I have so much to say about this game, honestly writing it down might not be enough. Even the video trailers for this game, including most recent updated ones, are NOT enough to describe this game. I think I might even have to make a video review about this one, has a special place in my heart <3Adventure, mystery, travelling, exploring, fighting, running, sharing and having lots and lots of fun. It combines the elements of an open world, there to be explored and seized, while at the same time being an rpg modeled game(?).If you like looting, there's tons of it. If you like epic BOSS fights, boom you got 'em. Or if you're more like me, and this is trully what I find most beautfil in Terraria, you can just spend your time away, building whatever your imagination comes up with. A lot of people say this resembles to Minecraft, which in some ways, it does. Excavating and mining for ores and rare crystals, to build them into an armor or weapon at a crafting table. Stuff like that.But its just so much more. Even if its a 2D game, it has so much depth. You can either play as a melee fighter, a mage, a ranged class, a throwing class, and a caster class (epic pets fighting for you and your team). All with equipable unique items, with different atributes. Even very rare developer items!!And without spoiling much, I can tell your there are a LOT of quests and bosses to fight, this game is HANDS DOWN my most played game in Steam, with well over 400 hours (Starting from the date when I oficially had it purchased >.<)I strongly recomend this game to anyone who wants a fun and comic adventure, and invite some friends to check your world, and help them in their own planets. My final rating for this game: A green Slime / 10  Dont forget to invite me to your worlds =D			"

												FIRST THING'S FIRST: This is not a Minecraft clone, I am only comparing certain features to it.Let me tell you a story. ""Once upon a time, I played a game called Minecraft. Wow, it was a great game. The crafting, the building, and survival. Great game. But one day, I decided to try a game called Terraria. Terraria has become my new favorite game. I haven't played Minecraft since."" (The guy in the story is me).Now on to the review stuff. Lets do pros and cons. Some are opinion based though.PROS-2D (opinion) I think it is actually better than 3D with Terraria.-TONS and TONS of weapons and tools.-Player creation. I think the player creation is great.-NO DURABILITY. Tools and weapons don't break. Build a pick, keep the pick.-Lots of unique enemy types. Demon Eye, killer glowing jelly fish, and so on.-Lots of classic enemy types. Zombies, Skeletons, and so on.-Lots of exploration possibilities.-Torches stay lit while in hand so you don't have to always place it.-Modern. One of the things I didn't like about minecraft was that it was set in times before tech. THIS game has guns, grenades, something I can only assume are jetboots, and so on.-Great gameplay and replayability.-ModsCONS-No creative mode unless you have a mod. (Opinion)-(This may just be me but) Hard to find iron and upgrade tools.That's all the cons I can think of.Overall, I give this game a 11 out of 10.Really fun so you should get it!			"

												Great game, Fell in love straight away, I never stop to play. The Slimes always say Hey!. Especially when I'm chopping the trees, to build houses containing NPC needs.They like to sell me stuff, and use my Gold, But it's ok, I get so much loot, I cant even hold. Most of my worlds are small, and the pre-hardmode bosses are dead, but no tears have been shed, because after the Wall Of Flesh, I'll be dead, dead, dead, dead. You see the game only gets harder, More enemies, more bosses. You will die, and cry, but then find wings & fly. This game is like this rap, it's bad & it's good.

They're both amazing games. Terraria has a s*** ton of weapons, which enhances the game with variety. I have sunk my life into this game, and I have severly enjoyed earning the victory when I finally defeat a boss. Many people also enjoy multiplayer, and it has a great community. You can fight Cthulhu's brother with a cat-sword, and a mechanical Santa with god-knows-what! Why are you still reading?!GET IT NOW OR ELSE YOU WILL REGRET IT			"

Pre review TL;DR:Terraria is one of the best games I own. It's a hugely skill based sidescrolling combat game with fluid combat and great progression.Pros:+The combat is fluid and skill based +Gameplay features hack 'n' slash and shoot 'em up elements+The rpg-like ability to make your own non linear ""class"" or ""build""+The building is great and has tons of variety+The game runs at 60 fps at max graphics and lighting in my huge base (Despite my horrible gpu)+The different biomes aren't just pallette swaps of each other+Hardmode is a MASSIVE change and improvement to almost every aspect of the game+Wiki is extremely helpful+Multiplayer while finicky at times is very easyNeutrals:=Can be confusing without wikiCons:-The ""survival"" tag is untrue, it is not a survival game at all-The communiy is...braindead-The game is SO much worse in the beginning compared to the mid and end. it's the most likely part of the game to throw you off, it's by far the most boring part of the gameRefund disclaimer:Terraria is a massive game but was made far before the steam refund system. Re-logic didn't rework the entire starting game to fit this 2 hour judgement time so expect the early game (prehardmode) to be the worst part of the whole game			"

The number of items is really big so we could spend a lot of time by crafting. I enjoy terraria and i recommend it for everyone.			"

												When you first start the game, you might wanna learn a few things. First you need certain knowledge to make your world progress and some extra bad experiences to make your next world better. So this game is basically practice. You don't need superb reflexes or anything, just luck and extra players with you, so you'll be in need of friends to win the game. The music is good and the mining experience is quite good, i enjoyed every minute looking, mining, crafting and trying sets for my style of playing. The negative point is maybe that when you defeat the boss that triggers the hard mode, the difference is VERY significant and you need extremely cautious and learn about potions and their side effects. You will need to learn about biomes and how to keep them. All your enviroments are essential, even corruption or crimson. It was a very fun game to play.			"

												When i think about terraria i can't find any cons. We have almost everything open world with many bosses, monsters and npc. Every created world looks different so we could never stop exploring but for me building my own world is one hundred times better. Difficult of terraria it's at a good level. The number of items is really big so we could spend a lot of time by crafting. I enjoy terraria and i recommend it for everyone.			"

												THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER AND IT ALSO HAS BUNNIES----------------I wrote the above review for Terraria years ago, but since it's my favorite game, I think it's time I write a proper review that hopefully does it a little more justice.There's a lot I can say about Terraria.  It's not only my favorite game, but a game that's very special to me on a personal level for a lot of reasons.  I've spent many happy hours playing this game, goofing off and laughing with the person I'm playing with.  I listen to the soundtracks (first one at least) regularly.  I got a tattoo from this game to symbolize my love for it (well, also my love for bunnies because it's a bunny from the game, but my love for the game is part of the meaning).  It's a fantastic game and I love it a lot.It's hard to describe exactly what kind of game Terraria is.  It's a 2D platformer, but it's open world.  It's a sandbox game, but it has RPG elements.  It's an adventure game, but it's also a survival game.  It's many things rolled into one spectacular experience.There's something for (almost) everyone in Terraria.  Like exploring?  Go exploring.  Like combat?  Plenty of things to fight.  Like crafting?  Gather materials and craft away.  Like building?  You can make some incredible structures in this game.There is no real lore to the game.  There are no set parameters for what to do or how to play.  You spawn with crude tools, and the rest is up to you.  There is a distinct progression - some biomes are more difficult than others and most people make it their goal to constantly upgrade their gear to progress through them - but even that is optional, and if you choose to do it, how you do it is completely in your hands.A nice thing about Terraria is that the game can be tailored to your preferences in a number of ways.  For difficulty, there's the ""normal"" mode, Softcore, Mediumcore in which you drop all your items when you die and have to go retrieve them (lest they disappear), and for those who want a real challenge, there's Hardcore mode with permadeth.  You can also choose if you want a small, medium, or large map to explore and build in.  Characters aren't tied to worlds either - any character can go to any world you make.  Play across multiple worlds if you want to.The amount of content in this game is ridiculous too.  As of the time I'm writing this (April 2015), there are  2835 items in the game.  That's a lot.  There are 401 different enemies and 13 (regular) bosses, with several others that spawn during the optional combat events that can be triggered by the player in game.  There are many biomes providing a vast range of environments also, in addition to unique enemies and loot.  There's even another update coming, tentatively scheduled for June of this year, that will contain hundreds of new items and much more.Although I have no experience with any of this, there are many external tools that can alter your playing experience.  There are mods if you want to change up the content of the game, map viewers and editors if you want to check out your whole world or change something about it, even inventory editors if you just don't feel like searching for, farming, or crafting that particular item (the inventory editor does come in handy if you want to make a world just for building but don't want to actually explore and work for the materials).Since your worlds are randomly generated and the loot and items always vary, the game has a ton of replay value.  You have the freedom to do anything you want when you play, then to start up a new world/character and play that one however you want too.  Due to the random nature of everything, after hundreds of hours I have never tired of this game, and almost all those hundreds of hours were before the big update a year and a half ago that added 1000+ items.This game also has wonderful drop-in/drop-out multiplayer.  I have played all but a few (<10) of my hundreds of hours with someone, and it is exponentially more fun to have a friend to build, fight, and explore with.  It does make things easier, however, since there are two of you to gather materials and fight.  A couple things about multiplayer I will say though - One, since this game allows you to have so much control over what you do and how you play, multiplayer might not be for you if you think you'll butt heads with someone else over how to do things.  I have not encountered this myself, but I imagine it would be difficult to play with someone who has an entirely different vision of how to play than you.  Secondly, there is a lot of potential for griefing in this game.  People can steal your stuff, blow up your structures, all sorts of crap, so be careful of who you play with (I only play with my boyfriend, for instance).  Wouldn't want someone in multiplayer to screw you over.As for the look and feel of the game itself, the environments and enemies are colorful and vibrant, with beautifully done pixel art.  The original soundtrack, composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly, is fully instrumented (not just chiptune or electronic), and the songs fit their individual situations (there are unique songs for different biomes, bosses, weather events, etc.) perfectly.  There are two soundtracks, the original and the one for the giant update from October of 2013, that can be purchased[re-logic.bandcamp.com] (or whatever) if you enjoy the music.All in all, this game gets a 10/10 from me.   The varied and vast content paired with all the freedom it gives you to do what you want, in addition to the beautiful visuals and music, all come together to create a fun, unique experience that could provide nearly anyone with hours of entertainment.  After hundreds of hours and countless fun and special memories of playing myself, I have not grown sick of this game in the slightest and I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't either.Sidenote:  Terraria is also available on Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, 3DS, and Android.  The console version and Android version each have unique content.  I have not played the console version, but the Android version is great (note: not as much content as the PC version!) and I highly recommend that too if you like Terraria.  Much easier on a tablet than a phone though.			"

 TERRARIA REVIEW   Terraria  is often referred to as ""The 2D Minecraft"", but believe it or not this couldn't be any futher from the truth. Terraria is a game that strives on being completely about the experience. Exploring, Adventuring, and Action is the name of the game to put it lightly. A game like Minecraft prides itself on creativity of the mind with a dash of survival that doesn't even compare to the likes of Terraria. I'm not saying Terraria lacks the assets to make creativity bloom, because then I'd be lying because I've seen some crazy stuff made in Terraria, but I've seen more in Minecraft.  Minecraft  has 3 bosses that are okay at its best, but Terraria has over a dozen bosses which are totally epic, and the amount of obtainable items towers way into the thousands by now. Something Minecraft couldn't achieve without mods. The items are insanely fun to use and upgrading your character's gear becoming more powerful as a result is so satisfying making the hours upon hours seem totally worth the effort.  Terraria  visually has wonderful pixel-art with beautiful pixel parallax backgrounds to accompany the world you're in. It also has a very vibrant ambient soundtrack that is just so damn relaxing and pleasing to listen to as you explore for hours on end. The game's control is on point, completely and utterly perfect with an exception on the consoles and mobile devices mind you, but on keyboard and mouse it's perfect.  From the looks of it  this is the end of anymore updates for this game so a review is more justified in my eyes, but I have heard there is a sequel in the works, so yeah that sounds amazing. The game is truly a masterpiece. A CHILL RUNS DOWN YOU SPINE, OH HOT DAMN. 10/10  "

												An old man awaits at the entrance of a dungeon. Stricken by a mysterious curse, he urges you to return after the sun has set, to free him of the madness that has infected his body. So you spend the day amid the grassy splendor of Terraria, surveying caves, slaying rabbits and slimes, as the hours tick by. Once night has set, you return to the old man, to free him of his curse and reap whatever rewards he wishes to give you. It turns out that the little curse transformed the old man into a demonic skeleton, a hovering monstrosity that unleashes holy hell upon your poorly equipped explorer. The battle rages for 10 seconds, maybe 20 if you run away at the onset, and then you're left staring at your corpse and wondering how you could ever defeat such a beast.But there's no reason to be deterred by such a thorough beating. Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you, and that unrestrained freedom is a double-edged sword. Free to explore the untouched lands, you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you, or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures. You're never sure where your travels will lead you, but your curiosity is always rewarded. You may gain knowledge, such as knowing not to talk to old men at night, or happen upon a cache of gold, which can be used to forge a powerful sword. It's a world bursting with possibilities. Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.An apartment complex reaching toward the sky gives your helpers plenty of room for themselves.Terraria debuted on the PC almost two years ago, and I was worried how such a mouse-heavy game could make the transition to a traditional control scheme. After a little practice, my worries were thankfully banished. Movement works remarkably well on the Vita, which makes sense given that Terraria feels like a 2D platformer. Performing precise jumps and grappling up walls feel even better using an analog stick instead of keyboard keys, so there's joy in traversing the world that didn't exist before. However, movement isn't nearly as important as excavation, and that's where patience matters. No longer can you dig precisely with a mouse; instead, you use a stick. The game has two options, manual and smart, which have different strengths and weaknesses. If you're clearing a deep hole, smart is blunt and effective. If you need to focus on individual blocks, manual works fine. Unfortunately, your cursor is controlled by both the right stick and the back touchpad, and there's no way to disable the second scheme, so you do have to hold the Vita carefully lest you dig haphazardly.Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.Discovery is the essence of Terraria, but thankfully that doesn't extend to basic play concepts. The PC version struggled to communicate exactly what you were supposed to do in this expansive world, and though the Vita version doesn't spell out every detail, it does a great job of pushing you in the right direction. Shelter is the most pressing matter for a lone explorer. Chop down trees to gain wood, and then use that wood to build a house. Once you lay out the frame, you need doors and a chair to complete the requirements, and that's where you get your first hint at what makes Terraria so appealing. You're told to make a crafting table, and by standing near it, you can make the rest of the pieces to finish your house. And there are a lot more items you can craft beyond that. With a bevy of weapons and armor, clothes and decorations, there are tons of tools you can make that help you become a better explorer.A little snow never hurt anyone.The items you can craft are clearly spelled out for you, so you're never unclear about what's possible. Once you acquire any of the plentiful materials strewn about the land, you learn how you can use them to craft something that could help you on the journey. Turn cobwebs into silk and then combine that with wood to make a bed. Melt silver nuggets into bars and then pound those into a shining suit at your anvil. By seeing exactly what items you can create, you're pushed to gather those materials as quickly as you can. You want that jungle hat, right? Well, you better find an underground jungle and gather spores if you want to sport that fine protective gear. An enticing cycle of hunting for materials followed by reaping a reward crops up in the early moments. Once you have golden armor and tools, you can venture further, which allows you to access even more powerful weapons.Much of your time in Terraria is spent digging elaborate tunnels beneath the surface. It's there that the most precious resources are buried, so you grab some torches and try to fend off the skeletons and bats as you dig ever deeper down. It's a slow process that stays compelling for two important reasons. First, with so many secrets hidden below, you continually stumble upon exciting new areas. Maybe you land at a place filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that can be brewed into a handy potion, or find a makeshift house hiding a treasure chest. You never know, so you keep digging. Second, there's a puzzle element to digging successfully. When you chip away at rock in the deep end of a lake, you have to figure out how to manage your dwindling supply of oxygen while going further down. Or you may have to divert water toward smoldering lava to create obsidian. You're always planning the best possible route, while fending off enemies, which keeps you engaged during those solitary hours carving out earth.It would be so much easier to mine this meteor if aliens weren't flying at your head.Once you harvest enough gold to drape yourself in it, you may wonder where you're supposed to go next. Well, thankfully, there's a guide who can point you in the right direction. Building houses attracts non-player characters, and each has his or her own way to help you. The guide tells you that it's finally time to fight a boss, and even details how to summon it, which is a godsend if you're lost. If you have an explosive in your inventory, a blast-happy dude moves in who happily sells you dynamite and bombs. There's no way to know exactly what will lure more NPCs to your commune, so just experiment with everything possible. None of them are necessary to complete your adventure, but they are a handy resource when you're stumped. Just make sure you fortify your walls. You wouldn't want a goblin army killing your only friends.Combat in Terraria is often simple. Killing slimes is more about positioning than deeper tactics, so most enemies serve as a distraction rather than a serious roadblock. Of course, you could play with permadeath if you want a real challenge, or lose all of your items upon every death, but such consequences were so severe for me that I didn't want to venture forth, which defeats the point of the game. The normal option is that you lose money when you die, which is a gentle scolding more than a serious setback.Digging a helevator is the quickest way to reach the bottom of the world.Be prepared to die a lot when bosses make an appearance. Every battle is against a massive beast that dwarfs your feeble adventurer, so you have to be smart and well prepared if you're going to come out on top. If you collect enough shooting stars beforehand, you can craft mana crystals that let you use magic. It's much safer to shoot magical strikes from a distance than to get up close with your warhammer. Still, there are many different tactics to take out the various bosses. And, who knows, maybe you won't have a chance to plan out a strategy at all. The Eye of Cthulhu randomly appears once you've become powerful enough, and it's crazy to fight this flying beast while in a subterranean jungle. Always be prepared for a fight; you wouldn't want to lose your hard-earned money because you forgot your bow			"

												This game is one of the best things I've ever played.  If you've ever heard somebody call it '2-D Minecraft', as I have many times, it isn't.  There's way more than 4 or 5 metals/gems, and you get roughly a dozen different challeging bosses.I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone, especially  if you enjoy fighting evil monsters of the darkness with huge swords, super-rapid fire guns, and magic.(or unicorns and fairys, if your that kind of person).

												This game is one of the best things I've ever played.  If you've ever heard somebody call it '2-D Minecraft', as I have many times, it isn't.  There's way more than 4 or 5 metals/gems, and you get roughly a dozen different challeging bosses.I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone, especially  if you enjoy fighting evil monsters of the darkness with huge swords, super-rapid fire guns, and magic.(or unicorns and fairys, if your that kind of person).

 TERRARIA REVIEW   Terraria  is often referred to as ""The 2D Minecraft"", but believe it or not this couldn't be any futher from the truth. Terraria is a game that strives on being completely about the experience. Exploring, Adventuring, and Action is the name of the game to put it lightly. A game like Minecraft prides itself on creativity of the mind with a dash of survival that doesn't even compare to the likes of Terraria. I'm not saying Terraria lacks the assets to make creativity bloom, because then I'd be lying because I've seen some crazy stuff made in Terraria, but I've seen more in Minecraft.  Minecraft  has 3 bosses that are okay at its best, but Terraria has over a dozen bosses which are totally epic, and the amount of obtainable items towers way into the thousands by now. Something Minecraft couldn't achieve without mods. The items are insanely fun to use and upgrading your character's gear becoming more powerful as a result is so satisfying making the hours upon hours seem totally worth the effort.  Terraria  visually has wonderful pixel-art with beautiful pixel parallax backgrounds to accompany the world you're in. It also has a very vibrant ambient soundtrack that is just so damn relaxing and pleasing to listen to as you explore for hours on end. The game's control is on point, completely and utterly perfect with an exception on the consoles and mobile devices mind you, but on keyboard and mouse it's perfect.  From the looks of it  this is the end of anymore updates for this game so a review is more justified in my eyes, but I have heard there is a sequel in the works, so yeah that sounds amazing. The game is truly a masterpiece. A CHILL RUNS DOWN YOU SPINE, OH HOT DAMN. 10/10  "

												This game is pure gold. When I first bought it, I didn't know many things about this game, I just wanted to buy some game that's long. I was not dissapointed, I couldn't stop playing it. There are so many things to do in Terraria, anything you can imagine - you can do it. Which makes this game very interesting and unique. Amazing gameplay, nice graphics, great soundtrack. Multiplayer is awesome, because there is also PVP option. And also, very good price! Buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												Terraria is oft-derided as ""2D Minecraft"", but I feel that this comparison misses the point. Yes, it was developed sometime in the beginning of Minecraft's meteoric rise, but beyond the aspect of having the world portrayed by bricks and allowing players to construct things, the focus of the games is entirely different.Terraria, unlike Minecraft, is -- even before mods, unlike its contemporary -- a game about progressing in an RPG-like manner through a steadily more-dangerous world. Yes, there are resources to collect and things to craft, but there the similarities end. Fundamental to the Terraria experience is the ""Metroidvania""-style item collecting: You can find (or craft) new armor, weapons, and accessories that give you new powers and ability throughout your growth in the world. But to label it as a spawn of Metroid also misses the point somewhat, as at no point is it strictly NECESSARY to get these improvements; they simply make progression easier. For example, sure, the grappling hooks make exploring underground caves easier, letting you more easily mine materials for better armor and weapons, but you aren't stopped from making progress towards harder bosses if you don't have them.And this progression is the core of Terraria. Instead of having static levels or maps to travel, you get a single world, containing (as randomly determined by a procedural system) any or all of a mix of biomes from snowy winterlands, sandy deserts, flat plains, and the alway-present ocean biomes bookending either end of the world. Yes, the world is finite, but as it delves hundreds of 'blocks' into the ground (and, in the case of the Floating Islands containing unique goodies for those willing to build up to reach them), this limit isn't easily reached by most players except after literally hundreds of hours of play. Instead, 'advancing' in the game is dictated by defeating bosses, summoned by certain criteria, and after certain bosses you cause the world to change under your feet.One boss, for example, guards the ""Dungeon"", an always-generated construction consisting of gloomy halls, spooky scary skeleton enemies, and plenty of unique and useful equipment to find. Only after defeating him can you get into it. Another is the boss of the lava-filled Underworld, and upon its defeat comes the game's change into ""Hardmode"", wherein a certain action after its defeats causes several new tiers of ores to be automatically generated in your world (transforming existing deposits of 'basic' ores). Gear constructed from these materials are almost necessary to have a fighting chance to fight the new bosses, allowing more and more progression, and so on and so forth.While on the topic of boss-beating, this plays a major role in a crafting metagame, where some of the late- and end-game gear can only be constructed from drops specific to certain bosses. While it gets ""grindy"" in some cases, this means that you are always pressured to replay some boss fights, and in the interest of making farming more efficient this means you have to learn new ways to fight them, or take advantage of new gear.Last, but certainly not the least, is base-building. While it lacks the grandiose nature of many of Minecraft's greatest constructions, the Terraria world does enable no small amount of player-driven building to occur, allowing everything from simple wooden huts to huge multi-level castles, limited only by your creativity and willingness to gather materials. This aspect will only provide as much entertainment to you as you allow it, but that's the best part of Terraria -- building is a sideshow, a distraction, NOT the sole purpose of the game.With a new team of devs taking on the project and driving the game's growth (for example, Hardmode was a post-release addon, and basically doubles the game in doing so), Terraria is poised to continue expanding in all aspects -- combat, crafting, building, mining, whatever drives your experience. And with the price often dropping to below 5 bucks during many sales, you owe it to yourself to get this game if you love 2D hack-and-slash ARPGs.			"

												This Indie sandbox game really has a little something for everyone.Whether you are into building, creating pixel art, PvP, PvE, this game has something for you!Once you've made your character, you start off in the world of Terraria. Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?If you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.Beware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.In your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.Tunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy. The world of Terraria is yours to explore, and mold into your image.			"

												Alright. If you're a fan of games such as Minecraft, Starbound, Edge of Space and similar, just take it, or check a few gameplays. If it's on sale, just buy it no matter what. This game is one of those games you'll get stuck with for a long, long time.  Off Steam I played this for at least 600hrs. And now I am still playing it on Steam every now and then, since it sometimes gets huge updates that pretty much could make me start the game from scratch if I wasn't a hoarder. Many many items and builds with which you create your class from. Summoner, Mage, Ranger, Sniper, Warrior, Hybrid or whatever you want. It's all up to you. There is a lot of crafting involved and many bosses to fight. A huge diversity in biomes and offers many mechanics. A true marvel. This really is brilliant game and it's extremely fun to play with friends.>I'd give it a 10/10>Pros: there's just too many to enlist, biggest ones being Steam Integration and constant huge updates.>Cons: I don't have enough time to play and collect everything.And a special thanks to the developers for constantly making the game even more great.

												I rarely play these types of games, but Terraria was a really enjoyable one. I played with friends too which makes things much better. I built a whole house and collected all the dyes. The house looked pretty good ,':)There is a lot things to craft and most items have some sort of use. It has a variety of weapons and I love all the little details in the game. I prefer the artstyle of this game more than Starbound as it has its charm. One thing that is really enjoyable is when you play the game for the first time and when you explore everything. The way you become more and more powerful with nicer items and more NPCs. Twas a gud game fam ;)			"

												9/10Ah, Terraria. Terraria, Terraria, Terraria. This game is amazing.I became interested in this game when I clicked on a random video on Youtube. It was a Terraria video from Pedguin.I watched it. I immedietly started loving this game.Terraria is fun because there's so much content. I have played 241 HOURS of this game. And I STILL need a wiki sometimes. There are a lot of clever weapons, the monsters vary, the bosses are amazing. First of all, it doesn't give you a tutorial. That makes Terraria more hardcore for newer players. I love this. This game was inspired by a handful of games, including Legend of Zelda and Minecraft. Oh and by the way I don't like Minecraft anymore. The Building: great. Terraria makes building enjoyable by adding LOTS of decorations as well. You can also attract NPCs to your houses, which they will live in and provide assistance. There's an Arms Dealer, a Wizard, The (stupid) Guide. Hell, I can't count them all. But they all provide clever and witty dialogue. And you NEED the guide to progress. Not to mention that they are all useful and most sell things while others can heal you and change your hairstyle. The money system is great. You need money to buy things from the NPCs. AND HOW DO YOU GET IT? By murdering monsters. The currency is from least to greatest; copper, silver, gold, and plat, or platinum. There is a lot of mining. A LOT. But it's usually worth it to get a new set of armor or a special weapon. The mining is great because you are ALWAYS under attack by monsters. Did I mention the events? No? Well, the events are awesome! Events sometimes are either summoned or just happen. The events are: Blood Moon, Goblin Invasion, Eclipse, PIRATE INVASION (yes), and the coming ""Lunar Event"". The Bosses. Ohhhh, the Bosses. Terraria seamlessely makes the bosses AMAZING. The bosses are a mix of bullet hell and dodging their attacks. The bosses are really fun.There are a lot of Youtubers who play this, and I'm gonna point out a few; Yrimir, HERO, and Demize.Overall, amazing game. And it has even more potential.			"

												Terraria is an amazing survival game. The 2d gameplay makes it unique. There are currently 1786 different items in Terraria at the moment and more to come. The building is a little tricky at first and so is crafting. When you start terraria you create your own character in anyway possible to hair to shoes. Then you create a world, There are 3 different sizes to choose from when creating you world, Small, Medium, and Large. Small is a good size for someone who has just started the game, While Medium Is a good size for a more skilled player, Large is Good for a server more than 5 people. Each world is randomly gererated. The only thing i would change in this game is the damage slimes do, It can be really annoying to a new player if a slime keeps killing them. 9.5/10 idk even more			"

												Terraria is a child born from the womb of the glorious Golden Age of Indie Games. Take well recieved mechanics from 2011 Indie bomb Minecraft and combine it with the notion of gameplay being prioritized rather than the best looking graphics - and Terraria is born. A Indie developer clearly took a very, Very demanded genre and turned it to a side-scroller with pixelated art-style. As expected, people called the game a ""Minecraft clone"" and an imposter, today that is completely unreasonable. It is to be expected when new games comes along with relations to previous Video Games that people will rant all day about it's similarities. Once a few years has past, you realize that there is Plenty of room for fresh ideas no matter the genre.Re-Logic did the logic thing and took a awesome game mechanic with high demands, and made something new with it. The entire Survival genre had been unknown territory until Minecraft triumphed along and showed people what can really be done with the right focus on gameplay and not graphics. The notion of starting out as a weakling, no armor, no weapons in a hostile, unknown world. Slowly progress to make your first tool, build a shelter, slaughter something for food. I think you can relate to that rewarding feeling when it feels like you have survived the first night, and you are a bit stronger than the day before.Terraria has mechanics that extend futher than the ones of Minecraft, namely it's RPG addition. You do not level up, but you will gradually evolve with more Health Points and progress through difficult enemy encounters, boss fights and challenging environments. Loot is also a factor in this game, you will find random chests that will cease your hunger for luxury weapons and items. The boss fights also provide as gateways, once beaten you will be able to craft one higher tier of armor, weapons and tools. Giving the game a progression system and a goal, and ultimately - an actual ending.There is a very long way throughout a complete game though. If you decide to play on the Large map size, it will take hours to find all the biomes on the surface, as well as countless of hours under ground and to some extent - in the clouds. The progression comes naturally, as you have to extend your mining, crafting and hunting opperation deeper and more further out, to proceed. When you are tired of mining, then hunt, when tired of hunting, build. Your small house will eventually grow to a massive fortress, even with NPC's players in it to help you in your journey.Something that I have not tried too much is the PVP mechanic of the game, which is also something unique with this game. You can essentially team up into up to 4 teams, and play your game while being under the threat of other players on the same world. Try and infiltrate the other team's base of opperation to slow their progress, or meet up for an epic PVP battle. Of course you can all choose to play coop and focus the imminent threat of the hostile world you are all in instead of fighting each other.As mentioned, new genres will go through a bumpy road before the community accepts it being a new genre. Survival games are no different. Today, a few years later, we see a lot of survival games, and we do not judge them for it. It is a very fun genre for Video Games, and Terraria is no different - You will spend 100+ hours into this game if you are into the genre. Few games have grabbed me as much as Terraria have, with over 300 hours in it and I have yet not done everything there is. The game is still getting updates too, not only on PC but the game is available on Playstation 3, Playstation Vita and even mobile devices. In the end, this game became a very successful title, today with a little ""clone"" of it's own - Starbound.Do pick this up if you are interested in survival games, you will not regret it! Terraria is also an excellent pixel-art building simulator. For the modern little brother, check out Starbound (Review) "

												TL;DRAn amazing 2D adventure games especially with friends, dont bother reading my review just go ♥♥♥♥ing buy it now since it often goes on sale for $1-5.LOOONG VERSION.So what is terraria exactly? terraria i would say is a 2D version of minecraft in which you mine blocs, use blocks and build blocks just for the sake of the sandbox elements. Inf act drawing a paralelle line you would see many overlapping elements between this supposed minecraft clone and terraria itself but ultimately it is all bonkers and i would call you an idiot because terraria /=/ minecraft. Essentially where minecraft fail to deliver healthy optimization and incredibly boring end game [ENDER DRAGON HAHA] but decides to mix it up with lots and lots of tools terraia in its early days goes differently. I played the version several years ago where you just survive and kill some bosses but going back in now i realize many new things has been put in place.1. GraphicsThey slighly overhauled the graphics between years ago but essentially it is all 2D flat pixel retro ♥♥♥♥♥. With particle effects. Those particle effects made it rather tolerateable but lets not nitpick shall we? Look at the video and screenshots and that is what you will get.2. SoundStellar and does its job well. Zombies growl, sword swings, slime gulches and human produce inhuman level of groaning upon taking damage which leads us to reexamine our own lives and dashing any hopes of surviving in this fantasy world with our pitiful mor---- whoops went off track there but anyways the sound is awesome. Or average. cant make up my mind.3.GAMEPLAYGosh, in between the armor crafting, furniture making, boss fighting and even fishing, cant believe they added fishing. The game is a monstrosity of elements mashed together to form some bizarre form of sadistic satisfying level of fun and engineering level worth of headscrather in terms on how you ♥♥♥♥ing build that floating scout prison room. There's mining, crafting, killing and more building but ignore this section since this game essentially have ♥♥♥♥ load worth of things to do.4.CO-OP..... With murder.This game by itself is stupidly boring but add in 1 clueless friend who knows nothing about the game and lets just say its incredibly fun, you have the standard pvp options but you can ♥♥♥♥ing choose your own colour. ducking amazing but if killing is not your thing you can always join forces t build that tower of doom for killing other online hopeless chap. In the end its all about the killing.END♥♥♥♥ me i was bored, i might add some more when my head clears up but essentially read the TL;DR on why i think youre an idiot for not owning this incredible game.P/S:Played the yarr version for 2 straight years. Thats gotta be something eh?If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												This game is the stuff of legends. It's extremely replayable and just stays fun. It will stay that way forever. Redigit did a really  freakin' amazing job here. Some of you would say ""But Sharko! It's just a 2-D Minecraft!"" It is much more. So many more bosses and content. Sure, the worlds aren't infinite, but who cares? The non-3D just adds to it. It looks so amazing. There are even a few mods floating around. Don't like singleplayer? Invite one of your friends to play along. Want minigames and levelled survival? Go on the server list and pick a server. It has infinite replayability as you can see by my hours. One of my more advanced friends has nearly 4000. You can just keep playing. It's simply amazing. If you have it, go play it. Why are you on the reviews?! If you don't have it, buy it. It's definitely worth the $10.			"

												It is a game of looting, killing, and patience. You start off mining and exploring, getting amazing loot, then you move into the bosses, very good fights that anyone can die to, finally you kill the last boss and you start just getting everything in the game. It takes hours of patience to get 1 item that you will only use for 10 minutes - but this part is optional - you don't need to do the grind, and of course there's cheat mods too. With 627 hours of playing I would say itis a very god game, just don't waste your life on it like me! :P			"

												A great time-waster, and even a game to be immersed in for days on end. You look up a little bit on the wiki or just learn as you go, and take it from there. You build, explore, and create your own worlds of creativity or simplicity, all whilst surviving in a hostile environment that just keeps throwing new things your way.I'd wholly recommend this game for what it costs. If you can get multiplayer to work, it only serves to add HOURS of entertainment between friends. For what it costs, it's definitely a must-buy on my list. Great for casual RPG and building fans.

												Oh here we go. First of all, If you like 2d sidescrollers you would like the consept of this game. Merge it with awsome bosses, wepons and uber cool events you got yourself a game. Terraria the jaw-droping game is cool because of stuff like mana. Ever used magic in a RPG and wanted to use it in a adventure game? Well now you can! There are also places like the Ice bioume, Crimson, Croupted, Jungle. And Mini bioumes like the bee hive, floating islands, and metors! There is also multiplayer, servers that can be 2p game, to capture the gem! Altough it loses points for not being always updated it regains them for Terraria 2. Software from here is good. I recommend this game for the First-Stop-Shoper thing. You make your own char and you get stronger when you play so I give this game a... *drumroll*  8/10! Don't get me wrong it's a good game but there are flaws like Rod of discord grapple flaw. It's been patched and stuff have chagned. I can't wait Till Terraria 2. Good game, Good second. There may even be a third. So did I do a good job? If you got it beacuse of me then...*blush* Thanks! You can also become my friend if you have it or get it. See ya later! "

More than that there are many bosses and many enemies. If it compared to minecraft's skeleton creeper ender man and some pigment and slimes and one boss. You just need to buy one game for a humble amount of 10 $ that is always on sales and you will get many things and it's always updates . buy this game you wont regret!

												A 2d sandbox game with randomly generated worlds.Offers a lot of hours of gameplay before you finally ""beat"" the game but you can enjoy it for quite a while even after that, due to the randomly generated worlds you can even enjoy starting anew, or you can raise tall structures and let out your creative mind.Think of Minecraft, except now it has a working combat system and is in 2D. Has a lot of boss fights, minibosses, rare encounterable mobs and plenty of spelunking to find rare treasure. There's also no confusing crafting system as everything you can make with your resources automatically shows up and you can ask the guide NPC about what can be made out of your materials.It's going to get a couple extra content updates at some point in the future but after that I would rule out ""new content"", still, the content already in the game should be enough to convince a purchase.

												This has to be one of my favorite games on Steam. There is so much to do and collect that at this point, I don't think I'll ever be able to find every item. Terraria has great replayability and since your characters can visit any world, it allows you to begin anew without losing your progress. I've set up a gigantic storage world so I can horde every item and block I've ever collected and my collection continues to grow. But out of all this, the best part of Terraria is co-op.Since the game progression is fast paced, you can start a game with a friend and reach end-game in about a week or sooner depending on how long you play for. Co-op really works well in this game mainly because the fighting style. Spelunking with a friend is always safer especially once you plunge into hardmode. And the boss fights are a blast with more people.The environments and random terrain generation create beautiful environments to explore. The textures and lighting fit perfectly together and the unique game music is the icing on the cake.So basically what I'm trying to say is: I love this game! I've put a ridiculous amount of time into Terraria and I even feel that the game is worth way more than the full price.			"

Updates are regular, gameplay is amazing, don't let the 2D look throw you away, If you like Adventure games where you set out for an adventure with your created avatar, craft, mine, attack enemies and chat and buy things from NPC's then definately buy it, you won't be dissapointed.

												Similar to Minecraft but in a pixelized 2D platformer style. However there are feautures in this game that set both apart, making it not a game competition but instead a player preferrence. Anyway, here's a brief analysis about Terraria:- You can build a house, a bunker, a hut, a castle, a village, a tower, a base, a farm, a floating island or whatever you have in mind by placing the blocks and the furniture you want. There are so many different blocks that some people even make pixel drawings with them.- You can gather resources, such as mining for ores, chop wood, harvest hay, pick plants (and yet you can make a farm of them), catch critters, and even fishing.- You can smelt, mix or craft new items (materials, gear, weapons, potions, acessories, objects, blocks, food, furniture, etc) based on the resources you've gathered or even from other materials. You can also paint blocks/walls or dye your equipment. You literally have thousands of different items.- There are many different types of weapons: swords, axes, hammers, pickaxes, spears, flails, yoyos, boomerangs, bows, guns, crossbows, throwables, wands, spell tomes, summoning weapons, and few others. These weapons are distincted by dealing melee, ranged or magic damage.- You can ride through minecarts, summon pets and ride mounts.- There are hundreds of different enemies, most of them are located in their specific biomes or in a specific weather/day condition, some even drop some specific rare items (some are even essential for crafting). There are also bosses that appear only in specific biomes.- There are some events that might catch you by surprise. It may happen enemy invasions (like a goblin army or even aliens) or invasions based on odd moon phases (like Blood Moon or Solar Eclipse). NPCs (villagers) will get different behaviours based on the day/night cycle or lunar phases (like a NPC selling certain items during a certain part of the day or female NPCs speaking agressively during Blood Moon).- With the proper accessories, you can fly and/or double-jump in action. (note that there is no Creative mode nor Spectator mode in Terraria, however it has a Camera Mode)- Biomes are not that static as it seems. Some can expand on the dirt/mud, some can even corrupt other biomes to become part of their own (via dirt, stone and even sand) and spawn unwanted enemies while making impossible for your NPCs to live in (which is one of the many challenges in this game, some players tend to extinct these kind of biomes to preserve other biomes or their villages).- There are a certain type of difficuly settings that you can put when making a character (softcore, mediumcore or hardcore aka permadeath) or generating a map (you can set it to Expert mode where it alters enemy stats, drops, loot, spawns, buffs, death penalizations, etc). However, after defeating a boss called ""Wall of Flesh"", you'll enter on what will be called as ""Hardmode"". From this point on many new (and yet stronger) enemies will spawn on each biome, new yet more valuable ores will randomly appear, new random events might happen, enemies may drop new items, biomes that tend to corrupt will corrupt faster, you can procceed to new yet stronger bosses, new NPCs (villagers) can be found while current ones can sell new items, and many new items to loot.- You have the Multiplayer feauture. You can host or join a server via IP address, or you can easily invite/join your friends directly via Steam, which quite fun when fighting bosses. In Multiplayer you can also join a team (red, blue, green, yellow, etc), so you can kill and loot a player from the opposite team or even do a ""Capture the Gem"" match. Overall, I'll give it a 9/10. Despite not having an infinite map, the whole map itself is very rich when it comes to resources, mobs, caves and loot.			"

Don't get me wrong it's a good game but there are flaws like Rod of discord grapple flaw. It's been patched and stuff have chagned. I can't wait Till Terraria 2. Good game, Good second. There may even be a third. So did I do a good job? If you got it beacuse of me then...*blush* Thanks! You can also become my friend if you have it or get it. See ya later! "

												I dont know why I didnt make this review sooner.This game is really good, it has some major progression issues towards the late-middle to end game where they close off the wide variety they offered in the beginning and slim it down to only allowing you 2 or 3 choices per ""class"" (classes being magic, gun and melee oriented) but that doesnt stop it from being a fantastic experience that I highly reccomend.

												After reaching 800 hours, I think it's about time I wrote a review of this game. I've restarted my terraria save countless times over and I have never found an end to the joy I get it. Terraria offers it's own unique and thrilling experience the further you get into the game, whether it's spamming shurikens and knives at bosses, to picking away at ore pockets in the caverns and even just going about your stroll over to the oceon. Recently, I got playing this game again with a friend of mine, early on they kept asking 'when's the fun part?'. Once we actually had semi-decent gear, she finally said 'Oh yea, this part's pretty fun'. Long story short, keeping new friends to the game is a struggle but rewarding, best times are on expert mode where you can start ♥♥♥♥♥ing about who gets what and framing♥♥♥♥♥♥on each other.With the updates that game with this game such as the chaotic madness of 1.3, they've brought so much more to treat yourself with, and makes all the effort and time much more rewarding. How about the sountrack? There isn't a single decibel that i could complain about, it adds to the ambience and atomsphere of every level making the game even harder to leave.I took a look at the achievments and the percentage of people who've earnt them and I feel that not enough people are reaching these exciting components of the late game. People either than out of time or interest in the game and move on.  I can definately assue you that the game is worth every single penny.			"

												For such a small game you get a lot of gameplay out of it and for it's cheap price you can't go wrong. I love the 2D style art work for this voxel side-scroller type game. It really is fun! A little bit slow to start but once you have built a base and got your first set of armour, everything else falls into place and the fun begins once you start killing bosses.You can get creative too and build some awesome stuff. Buy it!			"

												A great time-waster, and even a game to be immersed in for days on end. You look up a little bit on the wiki or just learn as you go, and take it from there. You build, explore, and create your own worlds of creativity or simplicity, all whilst surviving in a hostile environment that just keeps throwing new things your way.I'd wholly recommend this game for what it costs. If you can get multiplayer to work, it only serves to add HOURS of entertainment between friends. For what it costs, it's definitely a must-buy on my list. Great for casual RPG and building fans.

												This has to be one of my favorite games on Steam. There is so much to do and collect that at this point, I don't think I'll ever be able to find every item. Terraria has great replayability and since your characters can visit any world, it allows you to begin anew without losing your progress. I've set up a gigantic storage world so I can horde every item and block I've ever collected and my collection continues to grow. But out of all this, the best part of Terraria is co-op.Since the game progression is fast paced, you can start a game with a friend and reach end-game in about a week or sooner depending on how long you play for. Co-op really works well in this game mainly because the fighting style. Spelunking with a friend is always safer especially once you plunge into hardmode. And the boss fights are a blast with more people.The environments and random terrain generation create beautiful environments to explore. The textures and lighting fit perfectly together and the unique game music is the icing on the cake.So basically what I'm trying to say is: I love this game! I've put a ridiculous amount of time into Terraria and I even feel that the game is worth way more than the full price.			"

												This game is huge. The fact that its 2d maybe will keep away some people, but this game is really good. It has a ton of things it has many, many items like swords, magic stuff shields, etc. Terraria a lot of accessories and it makes it unique and fun. you always have the feeling of oh, I wanna get that item and that one and that one and you wanna craft and sell and buy there is just too many things to do and that's good. More than that there are many bosses and many enemies. If it compared to minecraft's skeleton creeper ender man and some pigment and slimes and one boss. You just need to buy one game for a humble amount of 10 $ that is always on sales and you will get many things and it's always updates . buy this game you wont regret! There is just to may things to do and items to get.			"

												This game is super fun and will give you a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of hours of game play. With the never ending updates and mods that comes out there will always be something new to discover.  You can play alone or with friends and still enjoy it just at much. The survival, sandbox and crafting is perfectly combined. Enemies are hard until you get better gear. And you will always have a hard time against your next boss. The game is paced perfectly, because of this you won’t get tiered from playing it too much. It might be a bit hard to find out how things work without googling. But it makes the game still fun to play. It’s not too much grinding after thing, maybe I just got lucky with everything. You never feel like there is nothing to do. There is always something cool to build or a boss that you need to kill. The cool thing is you can build your own boss arenas where you can build defensive walls and traps. With the statues and some wiring you can build some really cool and creative stuff. And mods even add more to that. You have the chance to build fully automatic machines that can farm things for you. The further into the game you get the more diverse the armours and weapons get. So if you want to be a wizard you can get your magic gear and if you want to be a warrior you can build the tanker gear. In the beginning there is less of this which makes the game easier to understand and you will have something new to learn while you get into the late game. With every update adding a lot of hours of new content you always want more. There is no stopping the need for more. It’s like an addiction. The game is very cheap and every update is completely free which is why the developers are very loved by the community. The game got released in 2011 and still get very big updates.Something I used to get really annoyed at in the past was the lack of endgame weapons for each class. The summoner really didn’t have any good end game weapon. The best weapon was a melee weapon, it had the highest DPS. But all of this is fixed with the latest update giving all 4 different classes their own type of end game weapon, and not only 1 for every class. E.g. there are 3 different melee end game weapons. They have different effects and use but usually the same DPS depending on how you use them and what gear you have.The developers really take in feedback from the community and mould the game after it. If you have tips for future updates just leave them in the forum and someone from the development team will probably read it. This really makes this game great. If there is something that does not work after an update the fix is probably going to be out in just a couple of days. "

												This is a really good sandbox game. ""Eww this is 2D Minecraft!"" Awww shuddap. This is not like MC, its WAYYY different people! In Terraria there is more content and items than MC. There is magic, pets, and when you make a house and get the right stuff people will move in and sell stuff to you. There is different types of money also, copper, silver, and gold. You can get really cool stuff from those guys! Like the merchant, he has a mining helmet. When you mine and put it on and it will give you light. There are some freakin' aweseome items and stuff, like the bow, and the piggy bank, and there are even SHURIKENS! There are potions, and magic also! There is a different way of makeing houses: first you get the material, build the shape of the house then put walls! There done with your house already. and the mining is awesome because you tools never brake, and there are probably like 15 different ores to find, and you can make tools from ALL of them! And armor. There are tons of weapons to craft and find. You can find AWESOME stuff from the pots and crates, and get awesome stuff from the merchants too! [dunno if i've said that already lol]. If you like awesome sandbox games GET THIS! This the one of my most favorite games [And this is probably the longest review I've ever made haha]. I go this on summer sale, but even the base price is worth it! Barely takes up any space either! Okay maybe I should stop talking now and end this freakin' review! I leave you saying....

												Crafting, exploring, or fighting, whatever you choose player freedom is at the center of it all. It's up to you what you do in this world and that's what makes it so fun. Mining for new materials is a blast, and the more you find the more you can create. You can also tackle the various enemies about and hunt down some great bosses. Or you can avoid all that and just focus on shaping the environment around you and build a castle. Whatever you choose to ""Terraria"" is a constant source of player-created fun.			"

												Similar to Minecraft but in a pixelized 2D platformer style. However there are feautures in this game that set both apart, making it not a game competition but instead a player preferrence. Anyway, here's a brief analysis about Terraria:- You can build a house, a bunker, a hut, a castle, a village, a tower, a base, a farm, a floating island or whatever you have in mind by placing the blocks and the furniture you want. There are so many different blocks that some people even make pixel drawings with them.- You can gather resources, such as mining for ores, chop wood, harvest hay, pick plants (and yet you can make a farm of them), catch critters, and even fishing.- You can smelt, mix or craft new items (materials, gear, weapons, potions, acessories, objects, blocks, food, furniture, etc) based on the resources you've gathered or even from other materials. You can also paint blocks/walls or dye your equipment. You literally have thousands of different items.- There are many different types of weapons: swords, axes, hammers, pickaxes, spears, flails, yoyos, boomerangs, bows, guns, crossbows, throwables, wands, spell tomes, summoning weapons, and few others. These weapons are distincted by dealing melee, ranged or magic damage.- You can ride through minecarts, summon pets and ride mounts.- There are hundreds of different enemies, most of them are located in their specific biomes or in a specific weather/day condition, some even drop some specific rare items (some are even essential for crafting). There are also bosses that appear only in specific biomes.- There are some events that might catch you by surprise. It may happen enemy invasions (like a goblin army or even aliens) or invasions based on odd moon phases (like Blood Moon or Solar Eclipse). NPCs (villagers) will get different behaviours based on the day/night cycle or lunar phases (like a NPC selling certain items during a certain part of the day or female NPCs speaking agressively during Blood Moon).- With the proper accessories, you can fly and/or double-jump in action. (note that there is no Creative mode nor Spectator mode in Terraria, however it has a Camera Mode)- Biomes are not that static as it seems. Some can expand on the dirt/mud, some can even corrupt other biomes to become part of their own (via dirt, stone and even sand) and spawn unwanted enemies while making impossible for your NPCs to live in (which is one of the many challenges in this game, some players tend to extinct these kind of biomes to preserve other biomes or their villages).- There are a certain type of difficuly settings that you can put when making a character (softcore, mediumcore or hardcore aka permadeath) or generating a map (you can set it to Expert mode where it alters enemy stats, drops, loot, spawns, buffs, death penalizations, etc). However, after defeating a boss called ""Wall of Flesh"", you'll enter on what will be called as ""Hardmode"". From this point on many new (and yet stronger) enemies will spawn on each biome, new yet more valuable ores will randomly appear, new random events might happen, enemies may drop new items, biomes that tend to corrupt will corrupt faster, you can procceed to new yet stronger bosses, new NPCs (villagers) can be found while current ones can sell new items, and many new items to loot.- You have the Multiplayer feauture. You can host or join a server via IP address, or you can easily invite/join your friends directly via Steam, which quite fun when fighting bosses. In Multiplayer you can also join a team (red, blue, green, yellow, etc), so you can kill and loot a player from the opposite team or even do a ""Capture the Gem"" match. Overall, I'll give it a 9/10. Despite not having an infinite map, the whole map itself is very rich when it comes to resources, mobs, caves and loot.			"

												At first glance, Terraria is reminiscent of its popular 3D counterpart Minecraft. However, underneath its crafting, mining and exploration based surface, lies a game brimming with content and adventure. The game's main concepts revolve around the mining of various resources to craft new weapons and armours, or to design and build houses and structures. This crafting system ties in well with the game's combat and exploration aspects, and gives a greater sense of progression. There're many hidden treasures to be found, along with a multitude of customisation options. The combat is very fast paced and the amount of content featured is astonishing. Would highly recommend to anyone, whether they enjoy building, combat, or just exploring. Terraria's procedurally generated worlds offer endless opporunities and fun.			"

												After having put quite a few good hours into this game (and still going strong) I can say that it is worth the small price of getting it. Like some people, when I first came into Terraria, I exepcted something of a 2d Minecraft. After spending 40mins trying to figure out how to place a damn door, I realized that this really shouldn't be compared to Minecraft alone. This game feels like something of a hybrid between Minecraft and Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Yes, it sounds strange to say that, but considering the items you can get, the boss battles, and the general atmosphere of the game, I feel that is pretty much what Terraria is. That being said, it is unique in a lot of ways and highly worth getting. It may be confusing, difficult, or frusterating at first (I didn't look at the wiki until at least a good 15 hours into it, so that might explain that), but once you pass that hump, it is quite enjoyable.

												Now people say Terraria is just a 2-D rip off of minecraft. Now I dont hate either infact both are pretty great games, but Terraria is just better heres why.- Better Graphics- More mobs- More armor- More weapons- Guns- More bosses (Minecraft has two Terraria has atleast 16)- Much better community than FNaF - If you think its a rip-off you probably watch this kid for entertainment

												100% Would recommend this game to anyone.There is so much packed into this game for such a little price;-Hundreds of Enemies and a Variety of Bosses challenge you along your way even if you play on the lightest difficulties each one with a unique attack pattern and style. -Hundreds more Weapons to slay the foes you face varying from a Sword that fires Kittens as you swing, to a Prism that fires a Consentrated beam of Light that Disitigrates the opposition.-Thousands of Unique blocks, Vanity items, Mounts and anything you can really imagine.-A Multitude of ways to play such as a Ranged Bow/Gun-Man, a Warrior, Tank or Mage.-A Host of Events that will challenge you along your adventure and test your skills in survival.-NPC's to accompany you each one with their own Dialogue, Store and Purpose.-Player hosted Public servers so you can make new friends and try new game-modes.There's a lot more I could list but i'd rather you find out for yourself when you play. These are just a few of the reasons why hundreds of hours can come out of a small, yet big, Indie game. =D			"

												This game is awesome.It's like a Minecraft 2DBut it's better than MinecraftThe graphic,i love it,so much pixels!Awesome!The game is very big,contains lots of enemies,friends and frenemies.There are quests to do if you want,even if it's a sandbox game.There are a lot of bosses,not 1,not 2,not 3 but over 5 bosses.You have a Huge arsenal of weapons to craft. Daggers,swords(long swords,short swords,diamond swords,wood swords,adamantite swords,dark blades,blades of light,swords of grass,even the Excalibur),shurikens,pistols,guns,miniguns,minisharsk,megasharks,bows,arrows(dark arrows,wood arrows,iron arrows,arrows of light,arrows of the joker etc.etc.) and more and more and more of stuff,even magic books,rods etc. etc.One thing i don't like,it's the following: If you join into a server with the same character you use in single player,you have the same items,that means if you use hacks in single player,when you join into a server in multiplayer,you will have all the items obtained by using the hacks.

												When a game like 'Portal 2' gets a 95/100 rating then this game deserves 195/200 rating! This is a more or less a prefect game.. Believe me, I tried to find the flaws (as the critical gamer I am), but there aren't any.Besides the ton of content, all the game mechanics are so well done and balanced that you can spend 100% of your game time on having fun and especially being creative in the random generated world. If you don't have Terraria in your game library yet then shame on you. Go buy it now! :)			"

												First of all, I just want to press this issue: This is not a minecraft clone, or just ""2D Minecraft"" honestly, the most similarity they have is the concept of digging, building, and fighting. But it stops there. Even those concepts are so much more different from minecraft. It is a great game, and it has great replay value. It is more RPG focused than minecraft (Especially if you download Nterraria), and it can take real life weeks to get to ""Endgame"", at which point, you are ready to begin the mid level of game.Highly Reccomend.

												Similar to Minecraft, exploring randomly generated worlds where you collect resources like wood, stone, ores, gems and various other things. On the surface it may look like a simple 2D clone of Minecraft, but it’s extremely easy to get lost in exploring the world of Terraria.Pro: Insane amount of things to do, retro presentation and deep crafting.Cons: Huge learning curve and the game starts off slow. I Recomend This And I Love It.			"

												With the recent update (1.3) adding steam integration which allows multiplayer without hamachi or portforwarding, I can safely say this is a game that should be in everyone's steam library. It's a 2d sandbox adventure that not only has it to where you can craft a bunch of stuff, it also has it to where you fight bosses, loot chests, and a lot of other things that you'd expect in an adventure-sandbox game. It also includes tons of references from Lovecraft's Cthulhu to some of the NPC quotes referencing movies like castaway.So yeah, if you're a fan of adventure-sandboxes, then this should be a no-brainer, pick this game up now!

OverviewTerraria is a 2D, pixel style, sandbox, survival game with some small RPG elements. You start off in a world where there are various different areas to explore. You can mine, build, explore, and fight bosses. There are many different items you can collect and use to progress through the game.OpinionsThis is an all time favorite of mine. I like how this game combines a sandbox survival with a linear style RPG game. The world is huge, even if you chose ""Small World"". I like how there are alternatives in the worlds so its not the same thing every time. This adds lots of replayability to the game. The multiplayer is really easy to set up since it has dedicated servers now. The community for this game is huge. There are millions of very loyal fans to this game, and I am definatly one of them. I see this game compared to minecraft alot because of it's art style, genre, and gameplay. Ill admit that there are lots of similarities, but I don't agree with people calling this game a 2D Minecraft. This game has more of an emphisis on linear gameplay, while Minecraft has practically none.RatingsGameplay: 5/5Replayability: 5/5Multiplayer: 5/5Value: 5/5ConclutionEven at full price, this game is a steal. There is so much content and so many different ways to play this game. As of 1.3, the game is pretty much finnished and won't see anymore major updates. But the final thing that develepers are working on is mod support, which will give the game even more replayability than it already has.			"

												This game is basically a level-up sandbox. You don't actually get levels and stats to increase (except health and mana), but you get stronger via equipment. The point of this game is basically to kill things and obtain certain materials to get stronger and kill more things and find even better materials while finding some cool stuff along the way to build your house or make your house look prettier with.Those who like the level-up aspect are going to enjoy the wide variety of accessories and weapons to mess with. The people who enjoy the sandbox part are going to enjoy building their houses/building with all the different kinds of materials and furnitures.Replay value gets bland after a while. You can make a new character and get more items again (maybe even new items) in your new playthrough, but after a while when you get most of the items and you've beaten all the bosses the game starts getting repetitive and bland. If you're really creative though, you'll probably enjoy the game for a while longer thinking of new things to build.Overall, I like this game, but I think if you're going to get it you should just wait for it to go on sale.

												Ahh Terraria, where to begin!Terraria is an excellent example of a (not so) basic sandbox with a sort of RPG mix! With unique art style and sort of new gameplay, Terraria is a great choice for new sandbox/survival gamers. Through my time of playing Terraria, I have found an attachment to the game like no other! The unique weapons and armour, plus the amazing (yet some difficult) monsters you face! Not to add, but the music and sounds for the game add a hint of retroness to the game itself, making this game's soundtrack a taste of my liking :). Not to forget, those spine-chilling boss battles with so much difference between them, a huge challenge for new beginners and great fun for semi-pros to pros. Terraria unfortunately falls a bit short with the reason being that the superb game is only available on Windows computers, meaning Macintosh and Linux users don't get the awesome gameplay that Terraria has to offer. Overall, Terraria is an excellent game with Exciting new bosses, difficult adventurous dungeons, new monsters to battle and a wide variety of awesome stylish weapons plus defence.My rating for Terraria is as followed:Gameplay: 6/10Landscape: 7/10Uniqueness: 9/10Graphics: 8.5/10Fun I Had Playing It!: 8/10Average: 7.7/10Rating: BYours sincerely, Liam			"

												Самым молодым представителем этого нового семейства на данный момент выступает Terraria.Процедурной генерацией разработчики балуются давно.

												Terraria has got to be one of my favourite games in my lifeAlthough u may see that i havent played this as much coz i've always had Terraria cracked. It was only then Terraria was on Sale on steam so i decided to buy it to be kept up to the latest version automatically.Anywho, Terraria is a game where u go on adventures. Hunt, mine, dig, fish, craft, and build.Well, since a lot of people are comparing this to Minecraft, I'm gonna join in the fun!Some may say that Minecraft and Terraria are similar games but i can say that both are completely different. Having experienced both games, I noticed that Minecraft is much more creative in its mechanical aspect whereas Terraria is more RPG-like.CREATIVENESSITYMinecraft is 3D (Duh) and has a lot of different ways to build a house or an office tower by using all 3 dimensions to fit different designs for every wall.Terraria, being 2D, is limited in that structure as you're restricted to foreground and background only.FIGHTINGLYNESSITYMinecraft has limited combat as in its current state only has Swords and Bows. Although the tools can also be used as weapons but they are meant to be tools. The only way to expand this system is by installing mods unless Mojang adds more.Terraria consist of 3 different classes in its combat mechanics: Warrior, Ranger and Sorcerer. Warrior being the one with Melee weapons like Shortswords, Longswords, Polearms, Flails and Boomerangs also having the highest defense due to class-based armor. Ranger, one with the Bows, Repeaters and Guns has the highest DPS. Sorcerer is mainly the support class but its the longest lasting class as they have the ability to heal others or themselves if they are equipping the endgame armor.NOTE: In Minecraft, there's Enchanting to improve weapons and armor with higher values of damage and resistance respectively. In Terraria, you have prefixes that changes a weapon's stats negatively or positively.NON-PLAYABLE-CHARACTERSNESSITYMinecraft has villagers as NPCs. Consist of a Farmer, Blacksmith, Priest, Librarian and Butcher.Terraria has multiple NPCs and are unique in their own way. Consist of the Guide, Nurse, Merchant, Painter, Dye Trader, Demolitionist, Dryad, Arms Dealer, Party Girl, Stylist, Angler, Goblin Tinkerer, Witch Doctor, Clothier, Mechanic, Pirate, Truffle, Steampunker, and Cyborg.You are also able to get Santa himself as an NPC.Each and every one of these Terrarian NPCs has a randomly generated list of names.BOSSNESSITYMinecraft has the Ender Dragon and the Wither.Terraria has the Eye of Cthulhu, King Slime, Eater of Worlds, Brain of Cthulhu, Queen Bee, Skeletron, Wall of Flesh, The Twins, Destroyer, Skeletron Prime, Plantera, Golem and Duke Fishron. On the console and mobile version of Terraria, there's the Ocram and Lepus.There's more bosses for Terraria but they are Event based.BIOMENESSITYMinecraft has a very very long list of Biomes but they only vary in height and scale like Plains, Mountains, and Oceanic. To summarise the list of biomes: Grasslands, Forests, Jungles, Oceans, Deserts, Savanna, and Mesa. Including some weird looking biomes such as the Nether, Mushroom, and The End.Terraria seem to fall short on the variety of biomes as to summarise them: Forest, Desert, Jungle, Corruption, Crimson, Mushroom, Ocean, Hallow, and Space.That is about all for my Review although it's more of a comparison.I just want to say that Terraria seemed to be longer lasting due to its rich content without mods. However, Minecraft also has much to provide for but falls short when compared out of the creativity aspect.To conclude - Get Terraria if you're the type of person who loves APRGs that doesnt have regenerated maps.Get Minecraft if you love to travel far and wide to explore undiscovered structures such as the Ocean Monument and/or Desert Pyramids.I personally recommend Terraria to any sandbox / RPG lovers out there. Seriously, i've spent more than 2 years playing this game and i am not tired of it.My final verdict for Terraria is an 8/10			"

GeneralTerraria is a survival 2D RPG with free content updates, randomly generated worlds, and overall a masterpiece done right. Build, dig, chop, fight and survive are the 5 major elements in Terraria. Enemies that are small, to major bosses, you'll have your hands tied in an experience so great you don't want to stop playing.Terraria has proven to be one of the best 2D survival games for its multiplayer to play with friends, down to the part where it can be very hardcore to master. Terraria also has simple character creation, basically changing the color of your character's hair, body, etc.Building in Terraria is very basic and honestly great at times. Kill bosses to unlock npcs, build traps to protect your home from invasions or master it all with endgame gear. Yes, that's right: gear. Terraria has thousands of items to sell, keep or fight with. If you think you've done it all, re-think that.With a new team re-developing Terraria, they have made the expectations high for Terraria: reworking a lot of in-game features and adding brand new features like fishing or mounts to make you play even longer!My OpinionStill actively developed, Terraria is just one of those overwhelming games, if you've experienced it. Character creation is basic, which why would it be crazy? Half the armor you get in-game will basically cover your character up. Multiplayer is fun  when you play with friends, basically creating great structures, down to owning bosses. Terraria has been one of my favorite, well put together games ever since it released and when it was picked up to be continued via development.Thousands of items to collect, hundreds of bosses to kill, possibly thousands of enemies to conquer, and world changing difficult experiences.Terraria will keep you playing for a long time.OverallI have no complaints. Terraria is a great game overall.Rating: 10/10			"

												I got terraria as a gift back in 2011 when the game first came out. At the time, the game was extremely bland but still had lots of gameplay. Re-Logic has gone back several times to create amazing updates for this game even after several times they said they were done with the game. I can surely tell you that 90% of what you see in this game was never around during the first build and it's truly amazing.This game is fun alone and with friends. If you do have friends though I extremely recomend getting them to play it, sett up some voice chat and see where the game takes you from there.			"

												TL; DR: I like this game a lot, but the Multiplayer on it, if you have no friends, is trash.Terraria is a game that, just like Minecraft, is about Survival and Building.The similarities stop there.While Minecraft is focused on Building (Being 3D), Terraria is mostly about the Survival and Discovery, which translates, in-game, to Explore, Get Materials and Progress.I recommend not using a Guide (Asides from the in-game ""Guide"" NPC), unless you really cannot advance. If you must, search ""Terraria Wiki"" on google, and read away.It has building as well, some more options than MC offers, including a wider selection of blocks and colors as well. Only things that ruin it, for me, are the lack of NPCs (For huge houses/cities) and the finite world (Get Starbound, if you want to build rather than survive, albeit they are adding hunger next update).The game is flawless, as long as you don't use the Cloud...--Not Affecting GAME Review--As for the community, it's trash, consisting of the Item Trinity, which are people who give items (Usually End-game, therefore ruining the Discovery aspect), which I call ""Item Givers"", a certain world containing every item in the game (Also destroying ""Discovery""), which I call ""Item Worlds"" and those servers with the equivalent of MC's ""/give"" command, ruining the Discovery and Exploration aspects; I call those ""Item Servers"".Basically, if you want Discovery to be at it's max, avoid the ""Item Trinity"" (Item Giver, Item World and Item Server)....It's also overrun by kiddies who can't even type correctly, let alone play.

												This game, is incredible. I swear, look at my hours. 300+ hours of fun! I still haven't even beaten the game yet after 300 hours... mostly because it is a true challenge. I reccomend this game to hardcore gamers. If you aren't good with hard survival games that can be confusing at the beggining if no videos or people tell you anything about it. AND IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE MINECRAFT SO STOP SAYING THAT! Here are some tips throughout the game:First, get wood and make houses so that you and NPCs can live in them. For it to be a valid house, you need to have solid blocks, no  holes in the wall, a table and chair, and a background wall.Next, go mining and exploring. Don't forget to bring torches, NIGHT AND CAVES ARE REALLY DARK WITHOUT LIGHT.You may find cool gadgets that you can equip in your inventory, also, you should make some armor.Next, fight bosses such as the eye of cthulu and get even better gear.You can go and fight skeletron at the end of the world and have access into the dungeon.Keep playing the game and progressing further.Next, go to the bottom of the world, make a long, straight, pathway and then throw a guide voodoo doll into lava and fight the wall of flesh.You will now be in hardmode which makes a new biome and every enemy is buffed incredibley.I will let you continue from there on your own. Have fun :)			"

												I'm going to do a review for the game ""Terraria."" This game is an action-packed 2D sandbox game developed by Re-Logic. I honestly love this game prior to it's cons. So this game is an adventure game, where you defeat monsters and bosses, and face challenges you've never experienced in other video games. Craft some armor, get your weapons ready, and your on a roll already. This will get you addicted to the game from the adventuring throughout your progress. I absolutely reccomend getting this game. It is SO fun. If you ever get bored sometime or have frusturation, go on a server, or make an incredible house to get you pumped up. The graphics are great and the community is full of friendly people. Get this game. It's worth for only $10. Trust me on this review. You will love Terraria.			"

This review explains why mediumcore difficulty is the best choice for playing the primary RPG campaign of Re-Logic's survival crafting game Terraria.[. . .] Re-Logic's continued support and improvement of this already wonderful game has turned it into one of the deepest crafting-based adventure games ever made. And if you take my mediumcore advice, I think you’ll find your entire countless-hours campaign in Terraria to be satisfying, engaging, and surprisingly immersive.

												An overall interesting game, the idea of a 2D Minecraft confuses and interests me at the same time since I played the much hated Minecraft for many years before eventually switching over to Steam games in general. There really is not much to say about this game as it is really straight forward, but I'll give it a shot.I would like to start off by saying I have played a limited amount of time with this game and I have limited knowledge of it, so please understand this as you read my review. The first positive thing is the idea of the game. Someone has gone ahead and made a simpler version of MineCraft at a cheaper price (sort of). But honestly, that's also a negative, great idea, but you ripped it off someone...Now onto the actual game, it's frustrating that's for sure, in the 1 hour that I played it I made a good underground house (imo) and I was beginning to like it, then in about the period of 5 minutes I died maybe 5-6 times and my house became ridden with creatures. Certainly not the start I was looking for, but fun to deal with. In the next .7 hours it became apparent that I was a 'noob' the amount of crafting recipes and formulas was never ending, and I realised that this was not a simplified MineCraft, but rather a more advanced Minecraft...There, that's all I learnt from like 1.7 hours of it, do as you please, I sit on the fence.Overall Rating: 7/10 "

!! This review will be deleted after revision is made !!Terraria. A 2-Dimensional adventure in a pixelated reality. There isn't a specific objective for this game. (From my experience,) you're free to explore and do whatever you feel should be your goal.My opinions of it all:The GoodIt does have a few elements that remind me of Minecraft, but I wouldn't be one to say that majority of it is so. The soundtrack was nice, pleasant, relaxing. I found my expeditions to the unknown rather amazing; the randomly-generated worlds were astonishing to me upon first site. Those enemies, too. If only I could see more!The BadI don't know anything that I may need to speak of that I would consider bad about this game.OverallI haven't had a lot of experience in this game yet, but I did enjoy what I've been able to do before things happened. After I fix and survive my computer conflicts, I'll have this game another gander and edit this review for farther explanations. I wouldn't necessarily use this review to determine whether (you) want this game or not yet.--Sir Shinigami.			"

Must buy at any price [✓]Worth the money but wait for a small sale [x]Wait for a huge discount [x]Avoid at all costs [x]Terraria, a game that offers tons of things to do, seriously look up how many items exist in this game...This game is reffered by many to ""2D Minecraft"" , don't let that fool you as this has ALOT more to offer...This game sadly isn't very story based but it's still an amazing experience especially with friends. The Beginning/Pre HardmodeIt starts of pretty slowly and like any survival game, get wood , build stuff to survive and get weapons/armor to survive. This however allows you to start off however you want, try speedrunning to a dungeon to get good items, or start of slowly and nicely and just collect wood and oresThen you'll start getting into the boss fight/even farming some, in Terraria you get a chance of getting 1 of these 2 worlds, the ""Crimson"" world and the ""Corrpution"" world. These are quite important but keep in mind they're biomes, they have different items/bosses in the 2 biomes, both are very unique aswell, theres 4 bosses in the beginning of the new world, the Corruption and Crimson biomes both have different bosses but it doesn't change the number of how many you can beat.You'll get to the ""Devil of the world"" which is called ""WoF , Wall Of Flesh"" and is the hardest ""Pre Hardmode"" boss you can get and definately the final one for this mode... Hardmode / End Game After you beat the Wall of Flesh you'll free ""The Spirits of the World"" and then your Crimson/Corruption will slowly spread across your world, theres going to be a new biome! More enemies / items, MORE BOSSES! And more challenges ahead of you, the game basically does this""Hey player! You just killed the Wall of Flesh! Have this awesome item!""Player:""Thanks! This is easy now!""Terraria""EASY?! Well you're doomed now!""You get 7 more bosses now! Double (Possibly TRIPLE) the items/enemies unlocked and you'll die alot at first, you'll then get Invasion events! You'll get invaded for a whole day in Terraria (Or less if you're OP) and keep dying, those are exciting though as you get items and a non stop fight experience, after you kill all the bosses many players consider it finished but there's more... Expert Mode / Character Levels Expert mode! Basically you start off with Hardmode and then get Expert mode which is double to triple as difficult as Hardmode...so have fun at looking at the ""You have died"" screen, there's a plus though!Limited to Expert only Items1 ""End game boss"" <-- considered to manyAnd overall a bigger challengeCharacter levels are something that you get when creating your character and theresSoftcore Mode - On death lose coinsMediumcore Mode - On death lose itemsHardcore Mode - On death you die permanently, gg rip character Servers / Item Servers Servers to play with friends! Easy to set up with Steam and overall good quality for how simple it is (You do get lag spikes if you're on a friends server unless its a LAN) and there's public servers that are amazing! There's actually custom gamemodes made by the community (1 or 2 were staged for multiplayers by devs!)Gamemodes found on servers (Keep in mind not all are listed these are examples)Capture the  DiamondPortal Gun MapsTeam DeathmatchBoss Battle Arenaand alot more!Item servers are a sort of problem of people spawning in items into chests and anyone can take them! Even the Expert mode items which sort of ruins the players/feelings of beating the boss legit but knowing people get those items for free by going on a item server...Keep in mind you don't get somehow banned/ your character deleted if you go on an item server, I haven't heard officialy if servers get put down if they give out free god mode items but I did see some get shut down (Unknown reasons) Mods and Modded Maps You get mods for items and modded maps for challenges / gamemodes (Portal maps /Team Deathmatch maps etc.) Thank you for reading this :) Like I said already this is my longest review / the review I put most time in and I'd like to thank you for reading all of this :)			"

Reasons Are That You Have More Ways To Fight, More Weapons, More Gore (Hellz Yea!), And More Everything Than Minecraft EVER Would Have. Plus, MInecraft Updates Are Tiny And Don't Give♥♥♥♥♥♥ Terraria Updates, While They Takes SOO Much Longer To Come Out, Produce MASSIVE Amounts Of Things That Make The Game SOO Much Better. In Minecraft, It's Diamond Set And You're God, Simple As That. In Terraria, It's So Much More Than That. You Don't Just Become God In Terraria, You Fight For Your Immortality. You Gain And You Seek Out The Loot That Rarely Rarely Drops. You Seek Out More Than Just Diamond Godmode, You Seek Out The Thrill Of Constant Battle, And Risk Yourself, But The Risk Just Adds To The Thrill. Even The Strongest Armor In The Game Doesn't Make You A God, It Just Makes You Harder To Kill. Diamond Armor In Minecraft Is Just A Stupid Godmode For Cowardly Players Who Don't Give Two ♥♥♥♥s About Risk. Plus, Minecraft Is So Much More Costly, For Features That We Don't Really Give Two ♥♥♥♥s About. So In Short, Terraria Outmatches Minecraft In Ways So Numerous, And So Amazing, Nothing Beats Them. Plus, Minecraft's Combat Is Just Poke Poke Poke Poke Ded. Terraria's Combat Is Shooting, Slicing n Dicing, And Spellcasting. Suck On That, Minecraft!			"

												When I first bought this game I wanted an old style scroller, with a Minecraft feel. Knowing that there are a lot of games similar to Minecraft, I had a lot of games to look at. One game that kept on coming up was Terraria. I knew my friends had played it, but I didn't know much about it. I decided, ""Heck, I'll give it a shot."" Little did I know...Wow, this game is hard. Let me rephrase that. It is more difficult than I thought. When the night comes, you better have a shelter, or else the monsters are gonna mess you up. It also has a lot of stuff to do. Build, craft, fight, mine, multiplayer... I'm still getting into it, but so far, I like what I see.			"

												Addictive little surprise of a game.  Reminds me of an ancient video game I played as a kid called Below the Root, but with zombies.   Generates a entirely random pixelated little world to explore populated with creatures, monsters, treasure and adventure.   Build shelter from the zombies at night, mine, craft weapons and explore above and below ground.  Don't like the world?  Just destroy it and create a new one to live in.  Really Cool!			"

I'd recommend it to everyone that doesn't yet own it. Even if you don't like this type of game, try it. You might like it anyway.			"

Must buy at any price [✓]Worth the money but wait for a small sale [x]Wait for a huge discount [x]Avoid at all costs [x]Terraria, a game that offers tons of things to do, seriously look up how many items exist in this game...This game is reffered by many to ""2D Minecraft"" , don't let that fool you as this has ALOT more to offer...This game sadly isn't very story based but it's still an amazing experience especially with friends. The Beginning/Pre HardmodeIt starts of pretty slowly and like any survival game, get wood , build stuff to survive and get weapons/armor to survive. This however allows you to start off however you want, try speedrunning to a dungeon to get good items, or start of slowly and nicely and just collect wood and oresThen you'll start getting into the boss fight/even farming some, in Terraria you get a chance of getting 1 of these 2 worlds, the ""Crimson"" world and the ""Corrpution"" world. These are quite important but keep in mind they're biomes, they have different items/bosses in the 2 biomes, both are very unique aswell, theres 4 bosses in the beginning of the new world, the Corruption and Crimson biomes both have different bosses but it doesn't change the number of how many you can beat.You'll get to the ""Devil of the world"" which is called ""WoF , Wall Of Flesh"" and is the hardest ""Pre Hardmode"" boss you can get and definately the final one for this mode... Hardmode / End Game After you beat the Wall of Flesh you'll free ""The Spirits of the World"" and then your Crimson/Corruption will slowly spread across your world, theres going to be a new biome! More enemies / items, MORE BOSSES! And more challenges ahead of you, the game basically does this""Hey player! You just killed the Wall of Flesh! Have this awesome item!""Player:""Thanks! This is easy now!""Terraria""EASY?! Well you're doomed now!""You get 7 more bosses now! Double (Possibly TRIPLE) the items/enemies unlocked and you'll die alot at first, you'll then get Invasion events! You'll get invaded for a whole day in Terraria (Or less if you're OP) and keep dying, those are exciting though as you get items and a non stop fight experience, after you kill all the bosses many players consider it finished but there's more... Expert Mode / Character Levels Expert mode! Basically you start off with Hardmode and then get Expert mode which is double to triple as difficult as Hardmode...so have fun at looking at the ""You have died"" screen, there's a plus though!Limited to Expert only Items1 ""End game boss"" <-- considered to manyAnd overall a bigger challengeCharacter levels are something that you get when creating your character and theresSoftcore Mode - On death lose coinsMediumcore Mode - On death lose itemsHardcore Mode - On death you die permanently, gg rip character Servers / Item Servers Servers to play with friends! Easy to set up with Steam and overall good quality for how simple it is (You do get lag spikes if you're on a friends server unless its a LAN) and there's public servers that are amazing! There's actually custom gamemodes made by the community (1 or 2 were staged for multiplayers by devs!)Gamemodes found on servers (Keep in mind not all are listed these are examples)Capture the  DiamondPortal Gun MapsTeam DeathmatchBoss Battle Arenaand alot more!Item servers are a sort of problem of people spawning in items into chests and anyone can take them! Even the Expert mode items which sort of ruins the players/feelings of beating the boss legit but knowing people get those items for free by going on a item server...Keep in mind you don't get somehow banned/ your character deleted if you go on an item server, I haven't heard officialy if servers get put down if they give out free god mode items but I did see some get shut down (Unknown reasons) Mods and Modded Maps You get mods for items and modded maps for challenges / gamemodes (Portal maps /Team Deathmatch maps etc.) Thank you for reading this :) Like I said already this is my longest review / the review I put most time in and I'd like to thank you for reading all of this :)			"

												Terraria brings you a very impressive 2D adventure game. Its simple gameplay design, brightly coloured world and the ability to shape an entire village with actual NPCs make it a decent game. What makes it a great game however, is the enormously expansive amount of things there are to be found in Terraria. The lots of bosses, special events every few in-game days and an absolute boatload of items increased Terraria's play-a-bility enormously for me; even after more than 35 hours, I feel that I haven't even seen 10% of the entire game. Lastly, the cooperative system in Terraria is very decently executed, although server issues will sometimes ensue. Definitely a must-buy if you're a fan of Minecraft!			"

												This game is great, and let me explain my reasons why:So this game, to some is a minecraft clone, and there is only a few things the same about them- sandbox, pixel graphics and no set goal besides general advancement (nothing wrong with that)How is that meant to be a clone? You cannot claim inspiration as copying, especially when there is so little the same.it is a game that requires some patience, but a variety of enemies, weapons and armourm all better than the last and some even with special unique properties can make it worth it.The building is simple, and npc's are fairly easy to aquire, with some tasks that have to be met so that they don't all just jump in your house.The biomes are all unique, and the day night cycle drives a nice contrast between frolicking in a field and slaughtering zombies and giant eyes.If you look at the negative reviews, quite a few seem to say 'reached the end game and got bored' and yet most of those people haven't even played for 10 hours, let allone used a variety of ranged, melee and magic.Speaking of it, the 3 damage types allow for your own style, a tanky melee fighter that gets up close to enemies, an extremely damaging ranger, who is balanced out by lower defense and a need to buy ammo, or a squishy mage that deals huge bursts of damage before waiting for mana.There are over 10 tiers of gear, the first view being a bit boring I will admit, but once you kill the deadly Wall of Flesh, you get into hardmode, and THIS is where it gets really fun.The enemies are more unique and harder, there are souped up versions of previous bosses, with their own new wys to murder you face, and the gear gets much better.There are also 2 variants to most gear, and which you will get changes in each world.Now I played at least 500 hours in singleplayer, and even minecraft, which was my main game for ~3 years hasn't racked up that kind. Then one day it was on sale, and my friends got it. I now have 700+ hours!Multiplayer is easy and quick, though you must be careful of people with twinked items (or a friend that has an obsession with dynamite...) ANYWAY This game is amazing, and I haven't even covered all the good areas!The building is nice, with MANY blocks and background walls to use, and if you do it right you can make it so monsters don't spawn in your fancy new wooden house.More good things I am too lazy to type!This game may not be your cup of tea, mostly if you are not one for these sandbox games without much of a storyline, but if you are I strongly reccommend it!9/10, only reason it is not 10/10 is because NOTHING is perfect.

												Easily the best $10 you'll ever spend. I have 1200+ hours logged into this game, and it still is just as fun as it was back then. With the massive, free content updates and the fact that you can run this on a potato of a computer, Terraria is definitely a must have in your library.UPDATE: (11/24/16)Redigit, the head dev of Terraria left over a year ago to work on Terraria Otherworld and Terraria 2, and I was worried of what would happen to the original while he was away. It's been over a year, and we're still getting a lot of neat little content updates from the remaining dev team!			"

												Many people call Terraria '2D Minecraft'. While that is true in the sense that it has mining, construction, and sandbox aspects, Terraria is so much more. Hundreds of items, swarms of unique enemies, and 'easy to play hard to master' gameplay makes for a very well rounded experience. Don't let the pixelated graphics or the side-scrolling aspect turn you away. The dynamic lighting is very nice. Carrying a torch will light up the area around you. You can throw glow sticks down into caves to see what's ahead. You can even buy a mining helmet, and won't have to worry about carrying a light with you at all! One of the things I found impressive was the way liquids work. Water settles. Lava flows the way one would imagine lava should flow. Want to flood an entire cave? Dig a tunnel from the ocean and let it flow. All in all, Terraria is a spectacular game. It has multiplayer support, and the combat system ties in well with that. The most recent update (1.2) has effectively /doubled/ the saize of an already impressive game. Would recommend to anyone.			"

												at first glance, this looks like 2-D minecraft. nothing special. a straight downgrade. however, when you take the time to play the game for yourself, you find its a lot more than that. it may not have the extra dimension or creative mode that minecraft has, but it more than makes up for it in a lot more weapons and weapon types, more bosses, npc characters that sell a wide variety of stuff, and the multiplayer, while it can be frustrating and slow sometimes, is pretty easy to get going and fun. if you have the money for this game, definately give it a try.

												I can't tell you more about this game, other than it's original, creative, funny. if you think Building is going to be stupid because this is 2D, you are very mistaken. There are tiles like tables, chairs, plates, windows, ovens,furnaces, sinks, toilets. Anything you can think of, for EVERY tile in the game ( or almost every) Building can be more creative than all of those Take-Your-Money ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Steve♥♥♥♥♥♥craft games out there. Multiplayer works amazingly.Almost no major bugs. Extremely fun and addictive.If you're looking at this reccomendation considering buying the game.

												People compare this game to minecraft alot and I gotta say it is alot like Minecraft... for the first few hours. This game takes the gameplay alot further by adding tons of rpg elements (mainly by equiptment) and allowing the combat to evolve from simply spaming your sword/bow or whatver into flying around dodgeing enemies and projectiles and giant monsters underground while simutaneosly dealing a sufficient amount of damage. It is far more challengeing than Minecraft could ever be and alot more rewarding. I would suggest this game in a heart beat. Oh and the replay value is suprisingly high, not something I expected from this game.			"

												Generally I'm not the biggest sandbox fan, but this game has done it better than any other game I've played.They've somehow made a small limited world feel as vast as an open world Bethesda game, and that's what has made this game something to behold. It has a fast paced real time RPG feel that many players can get into, but the normal sandbox elements that fans of other sandbox games can enjoy just as much. Everything is just wonderful in this game: the soundtrack, the bosses, the building, just about everything builds onto each other in order to create something special. You could even grab a buddy or two, or even 5 or 10, and just have a blast playing the game together, exploring your completely new world.Terraria is a little bit of something for everyone, and I believe that it deserves a well earned spot on everyone's library.

Many of people might think this is a copy of Minecraft, but not really. Many of unique things are here. Unique mechanicsm. Bosses, combat to make up your frustration on your way of game, and what it's best is it's sandbox game where you're not limited to do anything, of course. These game types allow us to have some more diffuculty settings in our head, see Capture the Gem, Drow Elf, or some such so much there. Just really, don't know what to say, do it yourself.			"

												All the games i played on steam this is by far one of the best. It has tons of great features the separated from other games. The game is a bit grindy at some points but it still enjoyable. It has plenty of bosses from an Eye with massive teeth to an overgrown plant. It has events such as Halloween and Christmas with Special bosses.The thing that makes this game fun is the multiplayer such as dropping boulders on friends and taking their money or blocking the hellevator. This game has some of my best memories with friends. 9/10 it would be perfect but the mining can take a while.			"

												Terraria is a 2D Minecraft. That right there is an uneducated and ignorant summary of the indie masterpiece which is Terraria. While some of the concepts are alike Minecraft, it is unique in it's RPG elements and wide variety of items which is well over that of Minecraft's amount. With over 1000 different items and blocks, just under 20 NPCs, 100s of enemies and a charming retro artstyle, there is little I can find that disappoints me in this game. Gameplay is relatively simple and even though once you get up to the Frost Moon event you will still find new things to do. On top of that the game is actively being updated; with updates providing players with a hefty amount of new content. Multiplayer is good fun although I prefer the more easygoing experience of singleplayer. Like most games there are large public servers but you can easily make LAN and Private servers with the aid of programs such as LogMeIn Hamachi. Terraria is a relaxing, fun and unique sandbox; don't listen to the naysayers who shun this game because of it's small and irrelevant similarities to Minecraft.			"

												I have stopped playing this game.That doesn't mean it is bad; it is an exceedingly excellent game. I simply stopped playing because I wanted to be able to play other games as well. But I have nominated this for the Test of Time award on Steam because I believe this is one game I will always fondly look back on and will definitely replay in the future, if only for its free content updates (which you rarely find in the gaming world nowadays!)Its art style may look dated, but the level of polish totally points to a development team that cares so much about this game. It has some great ambient music as well.However, that is not where Terraria's strength as a game lies. It is in its escalating difficulty, in the expansive discovery and combat gaming experience it gives you as a player who explores a sandbox world. I highly recommend this to players who are into action games, and to a lesser extent creative players who want to design marvelous structures within the confines of a 2D game.Also, this game is just so much fun with friends!

												I r8 8/8 m8It's a great indie game, and the recent updates have only made it better. Honestly, all I could ask for now is larger world sizes... because why not?Gameplay is smooth, doesn't take a beastly PC to run Terraria. The music is beautiful and the graphics are a one-way ticket for the nostalgia train.The player isn't restricted by anything, you don't have to do things in a certain way. While there are class specializations in terms of armor or weapons, that doesn't mean you can't do whatever you want, whenever you want. Building is fun, and less tedious than it is in Minecraft (another great title). There are endless block choices, and there is a multitude of furniture to suit your needs. I don't know what you want, man, but if it's a side-scrolling survival crafting game, then this is the right place to look.			"

												A very simple seeming game, however its actual complexity suprised me, and positively so. THis is what many would call a side scroller, however even within the 2D world, there are many things to suprise you, to excite you, and to amuse you. Minecraft players can understand some of what is going on, though expect to have to figure stuff out along the way, or get help, as you go. If you do not like 4E style games, then you may not enjoy this. I would recommend Terraria to all others though, wait for a sale sure. But you are missing out on a game that can be enjoyed almost forever. Randomly generated worlds, with characters that can cross between them, have a storage world, and mine in others!!			"

												If you start playing Terraria is really confusing in the first place. The crafting system is a bit strange since everything is really small and you need a lot of different workplaces to craft different stuff. Secondly you dont really know what to do, so you start digging and build a house, maybe you find the first NPC. Then you craft your first stuff and kill some enemies ... still it doesnt make any sence.But then, suddenly there is an event or the first random boss spawn and you cry like a baby, running from the boss or the mobs. Now you now, i have to get better equipment and you start discovering the caves and somehow find some chests with nice items and now you feel ready to kill everything. You encounter the boss you lost before and kill him, thats fantastic!!!!But, oh no, whats that? There is another boss and youre where you startet the boss before. After a while you understand how to craft, you get good equip and youre ready to face the monsters in the underworld. After beating the wall of flesh you feel like a campion, but then you realize ... that was just the beginning!!!!Beside this unbelieveable good 2D action, there are so much cute and funny things that make you laught all the time you play. The cute and lovingly created skins for your character and the sheer endless opportunities to style your houses and rooms, the NPCs and all the different enemys.All this makes Terraria a ♥♥♥♥ing great game and i enjoyed playing it a lot!10/10			"

												This game is so interesting. A lot of items and very fun boss fights. This game is hardly ever grindy and is fun until the end. There is a lot to do and the recent 1.3 update made it easy to host online games. I would recommend this game for everyone. It's like an RPG, sandbox, pixel graphics, survival and online mix.			"

												If you start playing Terraria is really confusing in the first place. The crafting system is a bit strange since everything is really small and you need a lot of different workplaces to craft different stuff. Secondly you dont really know what to do, so you start digging and build a house, maybe you find the first NPC. Then you craft your first stuff and kill some enemies ... still it doesnt make any sence.But then, suddenly there is an event or the first random boss spawn and you cry like a baby, running from the boss or the mobs. Now you now, i have to get better equipment and you start discovering the caves and somehow find some chests with nice items and now you feel ready to kill everything. You encounter the boss you lost before and kill him, thats fantastic!!!!But, oh no, whats that? There is another boss and youre where you startet the boss before. After a while you understand how to craft, you get good equip and youre ready to face the monsters in the underworld. After beating the wall of flesh you feel like a campion, but then you realize ... that was just the beginning!!!!Beside this unbelieveable good 2D action, there are so much cute and funny things that make you laught all the time you play. The cute and lovingly created skins for your character and the sheer endless opportunities to style your houses and rooms, the NPCs and all the different enemys.All this makes Terraria a ♥♥♥♥ing great game and i enjoyed playing it a lot!10/10			"

												All the games i played on steam this is by far one of the best. It has tons of great features the separated from other games. The game is a bit grindy at some points but it still enjoyable. It has plenty of bosses from an Eye with massive teeth to an overgrown plant. It has events such as Halloween and Christmas with Special bosses.The thing that makes this game fun is the multiplayer such as dropping boulders on friends and taking their money or blocking the hellevator. This game has some of my best memories with friends. 9/10 it would be perfect but the mining can take a while.			"

												Incredible game, which has a thing for everyone. You can do anything you want - explore the mysterious underground caves, search for hidden loot, build pretty structures and pixel art, hunt down rare monsters, try to get your hands on rare weapons and artefacts, defend your home from invading enemies, make a town with tons of villagers to attract, fight tons of diverse bosses with unique loot and abilities, enjoy yourself fishing for random rewards, etc.  For just 5$, the game is really overkill - i'd give it 10-15$ tbh, just for the giant progress that it made since the initial release. Also note, that the awesome updates Cenx, Crowno, Yoraiz0r and others give us are completely free! And they are surely gonna support the game even after Terraria: Otherworld will be out.  If you really wanted a game where you could build, find rare stuff and murder giant bosses, then this game is for you!10/10 ~Crixalis			"

												Before about 100 hour playing this, I was having fun, but once I play it for 100+ hour, I started become bored, so since that I did'nt play terraria for about 1 year I guess ?, then I started watching some terraria video from Baum Production, since that I wan to play terraria again. I was going to play a modded terraria, but sadly my Graphic Card broke  when I play dota so I cant play terraria. I don know why its broke.My opinion, the gameplay are great, the mechanic, the graphic are nice, even the music too, Planterra OST is my favorite. What i'm dissapoint is, the mecha boss does'nt have a new mechanic in expert mode, and other boss like golem does'nt have it too. and re-logic should add more throwing weapon, like an upgraded shuriken, such as explosive shuriken, bouncy shuriken, ETC.I give this game rating 9 out of 10if the mechanical boss have new mechanic in expert mode, I give the game 10I recomend you to buy this game if you like a sandbox, action, and other.Sorry if my review bad, this is my first time writing a serious review, I always saying like ""Best game"" when i review, but this time, NO, i will serious. I will try my best.			"

												I have put many hours into this game (400+). It is a 2D roleplaying sandbox with decent replay value however multiplayer is most likely the strongest part of the game. You can team up with your friends and play throught he game like you would in single player except with friends. On certain servers you can build with friends or strangers or pvp others for glory.While the begining stages of the game can get dull it picks up the pace once you defeat your first boss or two.The game is built upon 3 main classes Melee Ranger and Mage although there is no skill tree and you don't pick your class until later on in the game when you start getting more advanced armors with buffs for certain weapon types etc. This is where the replay value comes in. Many people call this a ""2D minecraft"" however it is so much more with both games having there own ups and downs.My final verdict is that if you are a fan of 2D games, RPG's or Sandboxes you should probobaly pick this game up if not then it isn't for you.

With the overwhelming support from developers and modders alike, this game has nothing short of thousands of hours of enjoyment to be had.

												Dear Gamers,if you love Pixels and 2D platform games,I highly recommend you that game.Terraria is one of my favourite game I've spent so much time on.I almost only play games on Steam that owe cards and achievements,but here it was totally different.I had really much funs to play it and I do not regret all the hours spent on it.It has so much stuffs to do that you can't be annoyed by the game.Maybe the beginning, because it has a slow beginning but oh well!It's like that in 90 % games. And this one is really complete.Even before them last update, they made it so you can do what ever you want.Either you can have fun to do beautiful and giant buildings,either you can chase all the bosses and farm some to get strong items,awesome/fun accessories (Like, allowing you to fly.. Double jump.. ect..!)Instead of Minecraft, this one do really owe an objective.You will have to grow a town (not obviously a town, but it is really advised to regroup all your NPCat one place instead of spreading them all in the map) where you can regroup many NPC's.Most of them will require a condition.One would ask you to owe a gun, another one would ask you to save them (tied up in a castle, chased off of them tribe..)and you would have to conditions about the house. (Usually, one table, 2 chairs and a room big enough. Wall taken care of, and roof closed. With at least one door and one chest.)Over time, you become a badass. Your armor can make you run very fast, make light, make counter-damage.. Many kind of things.If you like crazy games where everything is allowed, oh please, get yourself Terraria and enjoy the crazy fun you can get off of it.Also, it's very cheap. (Especially in Steam Sold)I guess I am done, since it's been kind of a while I didn't played it I can't remember of every details,but I do believe and I do hope that you are going to have fun with that game. See you! :)			"

												This game is one of the most juicy games I have ever played. It's so good I don't even know what to say about it.The amount of things to do in this game is just overflowing out the buttocks. You explore the vast terrain in search of fertile land where you will set up your base. Then you begin creating tools to help you dig into the earth and find delicious minerals and creating weapons to fend off the creatures that seek to body you.Then you can expand your base to make room for storage, crafting areas, and PVP arenas. You can continue your underground search and find treasures and juicy dog treats. And then you can begin taking down bosses and exploring the more dangerous areas of the corruption, the jungle, and the dungeon. At a certain point, you unlock hard mode and the slams and jams continue from there.With that said, this game will keep you occupied for quite some time. And the fun you will experience multiplies if you are playing with friends. Don't think about whether this game is worth your money or not, just take out your wallet and do it fat kid. I ain't spreadin' lies here.I give Terraria a score of ""10/10 chewy like an eggroll"". Thank you for reading.			"

												Cleaning up my old review from 1.2 to make it more recent.I've added on a lot more hours onto Terraria since my 1.2 review (500+?) and frankly thought the game couldn't get any better.God damn was I wrong.Minecraft vs Terraria?Personally, I'd go with Terraria. It's done nothing but add more and more loot to the game while Minecraft stays with the same basic crap. Vanilla Terraria is better than Minecraft could ever hope to be in terms of bosses, even more than crappy mod bosses for MC, in which Terraria mods definitely trump them. My old review boasting the 100+ enemies? Yeah, still hasn't changed. It's only added even more since then.			"

												Terraria is a very excellent game filled with hours of gameplay. Including things like exploring, fighting, building, crafting, etcYou create a customized character and can rearrange much of the land to your liking to build all sorts of buildings and areas. You craft items and blocks from other items picked up. Quite a bit of fun random events. Once you get to a certain point, you can unlock Hardmode which opens up a huge amount of additional block, items, NPCs, monsters, events into the game.It's an excellent game and has so many interesting equipment to use and mess around with. For example, a useful tool to explore and climb things are different types of Grappling Hooks. Be sure to check out not just land and underground, but also the skies. There are some interesting Clouds with treasures. However, be sure to be equipped well, the monsters are much tougher up there. The game itself is worth the cost and in my opinion is very awesome. "

												Yea its okay. Expert mode really made this game so much more fun, you have to use everything you have in your arsenal instead of just speedrunning and only using the megashark. Normal mode feels like cheating at this point. on launch this game was £4 now its £7 but the amount of content they've added over that time really justifies the extra £3 unlike some other games that charge you for essentially updates, seriously this game was like a alpha state when it launched compared to how much content there is now. Take your time, make your world real pretty instead of just building wooden towers and you can get alot out of that £4			"

												This game is one of the better games that gets avoided for one major reason. Person who was suggested this game: ""Oh, its got blocks and swords, must be the 2D sucky version of Minecraft."" or simply ""Not a fan of Minecraft, won't like this."" Well guess what, WRONG!!! This is one of those games that you can only find it fun if you watch someone play it a bit in lategame, or play it yourself. A little complicated to understand at first, but once you get a hang of it, Best game ever.			"

												I have put many hours into this game (400+). It is a 2D roleplaying sandbox with decent replay value however multiplayer is most likely the strongest part of the game. You can team up with your friends and play throught he game like you would in single player except with friends. On certain servers you can build with friends or strangers or pvp others for glory.While the begining stages of the game can get dull it picks up the pace once you defeat your first boss or two.The game is built upon 3 main classes Melee Ranger and Mage although there is no skill tree and you don't pick your class until later on in the game when you start getting more advanced armors with buffs for certain weapon types etc. This is where the replay value comes in. Many people call this a ""2D minecraft"" however it is so much more with both games having there own ups and downs.My final verdict is that if you are a fan of 2D games, RPG's or Sandboxes you should probobaly pick this game up if not then it isn't for you.

												Before about 100 hour playing this, I was having fun, but once I play it for 100+ hour, I started become bored, so since that I did'nt play terraria for about 1 year I guess ?, then I started watching some terraria video from Baum Production, since that I wan to play terraria again. I was going to play a modded terraria, but sadly my Graphic Card broke  when I play dota so I cant play terraria. I don know why its broke.My opinion, the gameplay are great, the mechanic, the graphic are nice, even the music too, Planterra OST is my favorite. What i'm dissapoint is, the mecha boss does'nt have a new mechanic in expert mode, and other boss like golem does'nt have it too. and re-logic should add more throwing weapon, like an upgraded shuriken, such as explosive shuriken, bouncy shuriken, ETC.I give this game rating 9 out of 10if the mechanical boss have new mechanic in expert mode, I give the game 10I recomend you to buy this game if you like a sandbox, action, and other.Sorry if my review bad, this is my first time writing a serious review, I always saying like ""Best game"" when i review, but this time, NO, i will serious. I will try my best.			"

												Incredible game, which has a thing for everyone. You can do anything you want - explore the mysterious underground caves, search for hidden loot, build pretty structures and pixel art, hunt down rare monsters, try to get your hands on rare weapons and artefacts, defend your home from invading enemies, make a town with tons of villagers to attract, fight tons of diverse bosses with unique loot and abilities, enjoy yourself fishing for random rewards, etc.  For just 5$, the game is really overkill - i'd give it 10-15$ tbh, just for the giant progress that it made since the initial release. Also note, that the awesome updates Cenx, Crowno, Yoraiz0r and others give us are completely free! And they are surely gonna support the game even after Terraria: Otherworld will be out.  If you really wanted a game where you could build, find rare stuff and murder giant bosses, then this game is for you!10/10 ~Crixalis			"

												Wow!I have had this game in my Steam Library for nearly two years and had only played it once , for about 10 minutes before uninstalling it. I didn't understand how it worked. Plain and simple. Frankly I was spoiled by the flagrantly straightforward nature of Minecraft.  Here recently though, and for no reason whatsoever, other than; I guess, curiosity, and the fact that I’m burned smooth the heck out on Minecraft, I decided to give it another shot.First, let me say this: I love Minecraft, but seriously, aside from building some random things, some quite cool, and proclaiming, ""Look what I made,"" there isn’t much to it. You can pretty much see everything there is to see, in a mere five hours of goofing around, if not much less. Terraria, on the other hand, is massive! I am constantly surprised by just how enormous this game is. I’m actually quite stupefied by this games lack of visibility. After spending some time with it, I can’t see why anyone would even want to play Minecraft. This game has everything and way, way more. Its just 2D, which is probably a turn off to most and pixel art, BUT, it’s fluidly animated, with tight, precise controls and runs fantastically on even the most basic system. The particle effects and simple physics, along with plenty of gratifying explosions, colorful dismemberment, -of enemies….and you- are pleasing enough to allow most people, I would imagine, to get passed their initial deterrents with relative ease. What really grabbed me about this game, wasn't just the overall vastness of the map, but the incredible range of craftable items, armor and weapons. It feels so nice when you get a rare drop or find a new more powerful weapon or accessory, that makes traversing the world easier. It starts out rough and certainly seems mind numbingly basic, but get past that, and you will find that it’s well worth the time. Just dig deeper, literally, the games best content, by far, is deep below the surface of the world.Me, I love to explore and find new things. I love getting more powerful weapons and not having to worry about breaking or losing them, due to some stupid, unavoidable event (although there are harder modes which penalize you a bit more ruthlessly; dropping gear, items and even permanent character loss for the Hardcore players). I love going back to places I used to get trounced in and do the trouncing. If I can bring a friend to help, all the better. The co-op in Terraria is crazy fun. My girlfriend and I, are enthralled. I Highly recommend this game to couples who, along with knowing how to portforward and research how to run their own servers (it’s easy) also love exploration and loot quest games. For instance: Do you love Zelda games? Metroid Games? Castlevania, maybe? This is your game and For 10 bucks, you are basically stealing it. Note: If you get confused on how to start, or what to do in general. If the size of the game overwhelms you, don't worry, there are plenty of immensely entertaining YouTube videos of people playing from start to finish as well superfluous wiki.Have fun.			"

												A lot of people say that Terraria is just 2D Minecraft. And on the surface, the two are very similar. But dig deeper (pun intended), and the differences start to emerge. I have put quite a few hours into Terraria, and I quite enjoyed it. Its combination of sandbox creativity, RPG-like dungeon crawling, and seemingly endless stream of items and bosses kept the game interesting. There are a few problems that I had with it, but most of them could be solved with mods or a few minor updates. Overall, I had a very good time with Terraria, and I most certainly would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the survival, sandbox, or RPG genres.			"

												Terraria is a game about fighting evil that is taking over the world, more or less. The game has a lot in place for a lot of different people. Obviously some people prefer to fight enemies 24/7 and others prefer to build a deluxe house with the finest of furniture. I'm both of those.Terraria is probably famous because of its ""bosses,"" probably the most known one the Eye of Cthulhu. I think some people get a bad idea about the game from this ""boss"" aspect. If you REALLY don't want to fight bosses, (which I don't exactly recommend) you can choose to avoid them and just not continue in the game.The game is filled with so much content it's unbelievable. You think of something that would help you in the game, chances are it's been added! I used to play mostly in the time of 1.2 but I recently started playing again for 1.3.1, and there are a LOT of new features.To sum my longest review up, Terraria is right for you no matter what you want. ""There's something for everyone,"" as the wiki describes it.TL;DR: You'll like it either way. Buy it.			"

												Terraria is a Teen rated sandbox sidescroller where you create a charecter, fight monsters, search for supplies, build communities and of course hang with friends. Now when I first played this, I wasen't a noob. (I played it on Xbox)  I knew instantly how to play. Enough bragging about my winnings. It's time to give you what you wan't. This game is well known for it's bosses & minions. It's also known for it's badass level customization. Like...uh. You want to dress up like that alien from Aliens? Well now you can get it & wear it ingame. Some bosses include skeletron, the eater of worlds, eye of cthulhu and the very own twins. Most of these bosses require you to think of a way to trap them, attack them or block them. And now you say...What else is here? I like what I hear.Well timmy, I shall say that last up is the biomes or places.Inside this game there a lots of places for you to visit..such as: Space, Hell, Underground (cave), underwater, juungle, desert and the winter forest. Now this game arouses you, you say? Well. GO BUY IT THEN!			"

												One of the best games on Steam that everyone needs to buy. It is one giant sandbox and you can explore wherever you want. Dig to the bottom of the world, or fly all the way up to space. Building up your character from your basic clothes and pickaxe, into some of the games best equipment feels very rewarding. Lots of random events keep things fresh. You never know what will happen in each game world day (or night). Building a base of operations is another highlight. There are hundreds of different items you can use to build a house, or whatever you want, to store all your treasures you have found throughout the game. You also need to build a place for all the NPCs to stay. They offer lots of different items you can buy from them, so its important that you don't drop them off into a lava pit somewhere (besides the Guide).There are over 10 bosses in the game and they all provide a great challenge that you need to be well prepared for. They also drop some of the game's best loot and defeating them is a requirement in order to progress through the game. There are so many different equipment combinations you can use in the game, that everyone has a different strategy for each boss. Fight them however you want. Build a giant arena for an epic fight, create a complex trap system to kill the boss in, or shoot them from long range with your laser pistol. Anything is possible.Each time you create a world, it is randomly generated. This means no 2 worlds will have anything in the same places. There are also lots of mods for the game for when you want to try something different. Some overhaul the game drastically and are very worth checking out.The game can easily last you hundreds of hours. Especially if you are playing with friends.			"

												I remember when I bought Terraria, I played it for about 15 minutes and was like, nah, there's not much here.  Now that I have 129 hours into it, I can say there's a lot more to it than it first appears.  This is actually a pretty amazing sandboxy game with possibilities only limited by your imagination, or some such quotable blurb.  That's not even true, since if you find your imagination lacking, just download maps made by more creative people and pretend you've actually done something.  Win win situation really.  Anyway, great game, fun for the whole family, etc etc.			"

												Simply one of the best indie games I have ever, or probably will ever own. The first thing pretty much everything thinks upon first seeing this game is that it's just a 2D minecraft. That couldn't be farther from the truth. While it may share some similarties with Minecraft, it's so much different than it in so many ways. Most of them make this game far superior to Minecraft as well.Pros:Fun Combat (bosses, special enemies, really really awesome weapons)Huge amount of different materials to build withHundreds of weapons and armor to craftSoundtrackTons of NPC's that spawn in the world to sell you stuff and guide your wayTons of biomes and caves to exploreReplayabilityCons:Most people would say the fact that Terraria is 2D is a con. While that may be somewhat true as far as building goes, the combat works brilliantly in 2D. It's far more fun than anything you will find in any other sandbox game.I love this game to death. You won't find a better sandbox game out there. It only took me a mere 10 minutes of killing slimes and running around so find out that I had gotten my money's worth. Just buy this game. You won't regret it.			"

												Minecraft is trash-tier compared to this, so stop comparing them. *does it anyway*This game, Is an absolute masterpiece. The replayability is astonishing. It is also an excellent game to play offline. (I have around 500 hours in offline mode when I didn't have Internet.)The game goes on sale. Alot. It can even go for a measly $2.50 minimum. Hell, even the $10 price tag is a steal! The devlopers are amazing aswell, they constantly continute to pump out free updates. They may take a long time but they make sure to make it amazing when they do release them.Terraria is a side-scrolling adventure survival game in which you mine ores, crafting items and kill monsters to gain drops to enhance your survival. There's also an Expert mode, which lives up to it's name and gives even seasoned veterans some major difficulties, as one mistake can lead to instant death. The amount of weapons/blocks/accessories/monsters/bosses etc. is astounding.10/10			"

												To anyone who is considering buying this game, buy it, you won't regret it at all.this is the first game I bought on steam and I've now got a wide variety of games but I always go back to terraria, this is a classic game which you have to give a go. Starting out with just a copper shortsword, picaxe and axe you set out on your jourrney to explore your own, randomly generated 2d world.Terraria has low computer requirements to play the game so even if you have a poor computer you can still enjoy this amazing game. Terraria is all about exploring and progressing in your world while developing your city to have room for all the npc's.Starting off at the beginning the game seems a little unbalanced but you will quickly improve your weapons and materials to tilt the game in your favour. Even once you have done this though you should be up to hardcore mode bringing the difficulty right back. I have played terraria for about 550 hours and I still enjoy sitting down and playing it for a few hours. No matter how many times you complete the game you can still go back and play it through again. I haven't mentioned something yet which defiently needs a mention. Multiplayer.Multiplayer is a key feature of this game and is in my opinion as good as singleplayer, probably even better. When you find a server which you like, it is a real community feeling. You get to know the players and you can enjoy pvp, building, survival and exploration. This game has given me many hours of enjoyment and hopefully this review has helped you to decide to buy terraria because I cannot recommened this game enough.			"

												This game is truly amazing. This game is unique. And although is shares many elements with Minecraft, it is so different you cannot compare the two without sounding like an idiot. And if you say you ""Played"" the game and that it is a copy of Minecraft, you clearly played it for 2 minutes and then quit. It goes beyond Minecraft in many ways. Sure, you can build mine and craft items, but then you can go out and find items that cant be crafted and are super rare. It ranges from things such as aglets, to super rare weapons such as the Phaseblade. There is so much more to do. Terraria is simply Minecraft if you shoved in Zelda and some RP.			"

												Terraria could be described as a 2D-Minecraft, but this wouldn't do the game justice. Terraria is a fun and charming sandbox game, with light RPG mechanics. The richer enemy variety and the several bosses, combined with the light-RPG progression  add a feeling of purpose that might appeal to those who see no point in playing games like Minecraft. On the construction front it isn't as enjoyable as Minecraft, because the 2D-environment limits your creativity to an extent. But this is not to say that you can't have fun with just building in the game. But it won't go as far as it does in Minecraft since the game does have a focus on exploration, adventures and combat which serves it well but is also a double-edged sword.Terraria is well worth your money, especially if you grab it on sale. The game can at the very least offer you tens of hours of fun and enjoyable gameplay.			"

												First of all you can't compare it in any way with Minecraft. Those 2 games are completely different from each other because Terraria is more focused on dungeons/PvE/PvP while Minecraft is more focused on the building part. Of course you do a lot of PvP and PvE in MC as well but in Terraria it's an essential part of the game.I really enjoyed playing this game especially with friends. It's really funny to mine around with friends, farm things to kill your first boss, to loot the dungeons and so on!The only thing I have to say is that once you did everything in the game it gets reaally boring. Ofc they try to update the game as much as possible but often times it's mainly a little patch bringing up a few more items.This game is a must-buy game when it's on sale if not a must-have game overall!

												So, having been a longtime minecraft fan and avid player, i made the bad decision to transfer to windows 8.1, which ruined my ability to play my beloved pickaxe simulator because of the compatibility issues with my driver. so, i decided to browse steam for an alternative. and then i stumbled across this little gem, Terraria. at first sight, the visuals are pixelated, retro, and enjoyable. character creation is fairly deep for something animated in pixels, and it is essentially a 2D version of minecraft with alot more customisation in terms of the things you can make, the items you can gain, and the armours, clothes, furniture... etc.  beneath that, there is a host of NPC's that come along every now and then that just make the game even better; combined with the bosses, and the sheer sizes and depths (and heights) of the randomly generated worlds, and then the damnable hardmode that you can access which adds a hell of alot of epic things (crafting wings, super equipment and revamped super bosses) it astounds me that I hadn't picked up this game before. in short: great game, good visuals, with addictive gameplay that keeps this indie title at the top of my list.

GREAT SHOW<GOOD SHOWBAD SHOWAWFUL SHOW2D Minecraft, but not really. The only bad thing about this game is that it has the same symptoms of every survival games now, which is the WIKI/GUIDE symptom. You have to look up on the internet what you have to do next in the game in order to proceed.It has more bosses, more stuff to do in-game, overall more content.The combat is simple, but is still great, especially since there are tons of weapons with different effects in the game.I mentioned bosses, and there are tons of them, and they are not easy to beat. But that's what most gamers want these days right? A challenge?The level, and items are randomly generated, so it is always a different experience when you start over.You always get different loot, and there are tons of loot in the game.The music, is okay, suitable, and changes depending on where you are and what you're doing, but needs more variants. Nonetheless good.Overall it's great. I'm not sure if 100 hours is enough to prove that I have the rights to say that or not. Hopefully so.			"

												A pretty damn interesting game,it's pretty cruel at first,because without a guide or anything,it drops you right away on the cruel,unforgiving world. When you start picking up speed,getting better gear and exploring the enormous world,it's kinda hard to stop. I found myself playing it for hours and hours,exploring from side to side,from top to bottom,and creating my own ""towers"". With the new update,it brings even WAAAAY more stuff into the game,like new armor sets,enemies,bosses,things to do,basically making me pick up the game yet again. If you want an idea,some people call it ""Minecraft 2-D"",but i think this one is more based in action and boss fights. I would recommend it,definitely,it's a pretty good game to pick up and play with friends,BUT,i find it extremely hard to set up a server,because i'm dumb like that.			"

												I've never been in an abusive relationship before.  As a strong, empowered woman, I'm proud to say that about myself.  I have self-respect.  I have independence.  I know how to establish emotional walls and judge when someone is being cruel to me.No, Terraria isn't mean to me.  Terraria just tries to teach me lessons.  It punishes me when I'm stupid - I deserve it.  Terraria warned me not to go obsidian farming in a cramped tunnel after three hours of ore collecting and spelunking.  It said ""baby, don't do that, you're going to die from lava somehow.""  And I said, whatever, I got this!  I'm on a roll!And then the lava came through the water above me somehow, and I died.  And all of my equipment was lost.This was before I realized your equipment is only recoverable if you DON'T log out immediately in a rage after dying.  You have to suck it up and get back down there.I can't count the number of times I've run furious into dark tunnels because my lazy♥♥♥♥♥didn't put torches up, fumbling around looking deep in the bowels of the earth with a recall potion half-corked and ready.  But I get my gear back, every time after that.And every time I get uppity, Terraria is there to hit me (gently, in the face, multiple times, until I cry) and remind me what a stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ I am, and how I just need to learn my place and stop trying to go underground so much.Terraria loves me.  It gave me fairy wings and powered armor, and a shark machine gun that shoots homing green bullets.  I love Terraria, too.  You just don't understand Terraria like I do.  What we have is different.Terraria can show me such tenderness, except when it's eclipsing and shoving hordes of swamp monsters and vampires down my throat, even though I'm begging it to stop because I'm running out of ammo, because I thought a pile of 2,000 would be enough.Terraria always finds ways to ♥♥♥♥ me over and make me say ""thank you, baby.""  Oh god.  I need to get away from this game.			"

												I've 200 hours and I still have a lot to find! How much creativity this game has is flat out mental! Minecraft's meant for building and fighting, but Terraria has probably more building blocks, more weapons, more enemies, more diffrent types of allies, and so much more!! This is probably my favorite game besides Ratchet & Clank 4 : Gladiator or Deadlocked, Fallout 3, and TF2!! I cant describe how gud Terraria actually is!!!

												Ah, Terraria versus Minecraft, the classic debate. Or at least has been since around 2012, so maybe not all that classic.Before I played this game, I held this belief that it was a 2D ripoff of Minecraft. And that may be true, but in this case the ripoff is far better then the original.So, to start, I created a new character - he could be either softcore, mediumcore, or hardcore, but not that kind, get your mind out of the gutter. Softcore characters drop money on death, mediumcore loses items, and hardcore characters die forever.Next came the new world. I joined in 1.2, so I didn't have a chance to try Expert Mode, the super-hard version with more rewarding rewards, at least until now in 1.3. The loading screen was full of phrases like ""making dirt"" ""placing rocks in the dirt"" ""placing dirt in the rocks"" and so on. One message, though, read ""making the world evil"", which made me panic until it hit me that it was probably a joke. How wrong I was.That message was a reference to the game's unique biomes; your world can end up with a section of Corruption (dark and evil-looking) or Crimson (highly visceral), but never both.You spawn with some basic copper tools and an NPC called the Guide who gives very obvious ""tips"", but he can also tell you what anything you have in your inventory is used for.After much metroidvania-ing, I stumbled across the Corruption: ""Oh, so this is what 'making the world evil' means."" At this point you need to explore it so that you can make an eyeball used for summoning a bigger eyeball (that flies and has teeth) to kill. Then you get the game's most useless NPC, the Dryad, who literaly sells a glorified shovel (""The Dirt Rod allows the magical power of moving dirt!""). She becomes more useful later on, however, so don't let the zombies kill her (oh yes, I forgot about the zombies!).The next boss you should fight is the Eater of Worlds, a giant worm that lives in the Corruption. Or the Brain of Cthulhu if you end up with Crimson. Though I recommend you explore the Jungle a bit to get some half-decent weapons and armour, or a meteor crater if one lands.It's more fun to discover most of the content for yourself, however! So I'll leave you guessing about quite a lot.After digging down for a while, you'll get to Hell, and you can make some gear out of Hellstone, and the gear will look like it's made of lava. Yes, lava. Rule of Cool, everybody!Kill some demons and one will drop a voodoo doll of the guide. You then drop this into lava and kill the guide. You then run away from a terrifying ""Wall of Flesh"" that will try to kill you.After defeating the Wall, the Corruption/Crimson (Remember those!?) will start spreading through your world. You also get a second, ""good"" (or is it?) spreading biome called the Hallow, which has blue grass and lots of unicorns. This is when the Dryad becomes useful; she can help you stop these biomes spreading and taking over, but she wants you to root for the Hallow (if Hallow is actually evil, is the Dryad evil?).Now, this section of the game is called Hardmode, and my recommendation is to smash any plant bulbs you find in the Underground Jungle. No, go on, it won't summon a giant venus flytrap that wants to eat you or anything. And the evil plant will absolutely not drop a key to a Mayan temple full of lizards where you can fight a giant golem, most likely setting off an alien invasion. That will never happen.So to conclude, Terraria is a lot more than just ""2D Minecraft"". There's far more NPCs than the ones I just mentioned, too.			"

												-Terraria-So, uh, another serious review. Yippee.Gameplay:Ummm. It's barely similar to Minecraft, but it's the only way I can think of to start this off. So, when you start up the game, you get some character creation. Cool. NEXT. After that, you're going to start off. IT's the usual, get wood, build crafting table, get better tools, etc. Cool. But after that, nothing's similar to Minecraft. Terraria focuses more on exploration/combat, and even includes things such as boss battles, and when you beat the ""final boss"", a harder difficulty. Then endgame comes and there's nothing to do. Yay. But overall, it kept me for about 100 hours. Then Starbound came. (Review for Starbound comes later.) And at endgame, well, all you can do is build. And build. And build. Yeah. That last part took off a point.Story:...Uhh. There's not really a story or lore to this game as far as I know...yeah. Nothing here.Extra: The music's alright, controls are tight, movement's fun.Overall, 8.5/10.			"

												I was originally going to give this a negative review because I liked the console version better, I decided to give this game another spin the other day, and I love it. If you played the console version, this isn't much different. The game, being known for being a ""clone"" by Minecraft fanboys, is much different from Minecraft. This game is focused on combat and boss battles, unlike MInecraft, which is for sandbox creation, not combat, even with mods. I find the gameplay to be intense and enjoyable, especially with boss battles. I remember my friend and I always becoming overconfident and thinking we can beat Skeletron, even with our strategies all planned out, but we got whooped all the time. It was funny, enjoyable, and addicting. I wanted to relive these days, so I got the PC version. I did find the crafting menu a bit harder to understand because for one, it's barely visible, and two, it doesn't show what the other items you can get are, so that way you could see how to get them. The music is fine, and the graphics would probably be the thing that sticks out with Minecraft and Terraria. People would whine, ""Minecraft is better cuz it haz 3D blox unliek Terraria which haz 2D old looking grafix LOL."" TBH, I enjoy the graphics more than I did with Minecraft, because all Minecraft really has is blocks that can be used like Legos, so that isn't very original if you think about it. Nor is Terraria being original, but Terraria isn't being original in a better way Minecraft is. The one other thing, some people might say I have no skill for this, is that this game is actually pretty difficult. Skeletron and crew are all forces to be reckoned with. Eye of Cthulhu was always an extremely easy boss, same goes with King Slime, so they aren't part of this crew. The Twins, for me, personally were the hardest of all the bosses. Anyway, if you know me well, I love difficult games and is always willing to be challenged, so I enjoy this. Terarria isn't the greatest indie game of all time, but it would certainly make the top 10, maybe even the top 5.Graphics- 7.5/10Gameplay- 9/10Story- 3/10 (You really thought this game had much of a story?)Audio- 8/10Replayability- 9/10.:9.0/10:.+Challenging+Nice pixel graphics+Great gameplay+Interesting soundtrack+Fun bosses (Besides The Twins, gotta hate those two little cheapshots)-Odd crafting system-Too many NPCs, little use for many			"

												Terraria is by far one of the best 2-D-survival, role-playing, side-scrolling games I have ever bought on Steam, and I've been playing it for 123 hours now.You can consider it to be a 2-D version of Minecraft, but despite Terraria's limitations in graphics, it has so much potential beyond MC.You can generate small, medium or large worlds; interesting, and almost seeming endless, exploration; online multiplayer; NPC's that move into your homes and you can buy stuff from them and/or sell it; infinite durability for tools and weapons; only losing your coins when you die; all the items you have for your own character get transferred; crafting potions and acquiring a numerous variety of weapons, clothing and other accessories; fighting challenging enemies and bosses; and so much more.The price may increase as more content is added, but overall, it has been the best $10 ever spent for a game so far.Full review: http://www.metacritic.com/user/TheThing2010Check my screenshots! :DUPDATE 11/23/16Even MORE content has been added to this game with Dungeon Defenders II content!

												This game took me by surprise. I had heard it was similar to Mindcraft, except it was a side scrolling game. I actually found Terraria to be a lot of fun. You can explore underground tunnels, or create your own. Fight off a variety of monsters, collect treasure chests, harvest vines, trees etc. There are also quest areas where you can go into a dungeon, fight bosses and find exceptional loot. What I liked about this game most was probably how I could play with friends. Co-op play, travelling to different biomes and gathering new resources depending on what biome you are in, makes this game a challenge as well as rewarding. If you enjoyed minecraft, you may find this to your liking as well. The graphics are dumbed down, but it is done that way on purpose and gives the game a special charm. Pick this up if you don't have it in your library, I think you will really enjoy it.			"

												For a game that looks so 16 bit, it's so damn addictive!I've been playing this game for a while and I just can't seem to stop playing it.You have your standard building side where you can build what ever you so wish from a small house to a mansion to a castle. Imagination is your limit.Farming side where you dig to your hearts content to find precious resources, strange caverns, secret lairs.Creative side where you creating amazing items, fantasy looking armour or items to summon beasts.Combat side where not only do you just fight your standard zombies, flying eyeballs and bats or also have major bosses, teleporting wizards and creatures from the bottom of your world.All in all, Terraria has a bit of everything and puts in in a graphical world that, at the start looks rather dated but soon that gets over looked and becomes enjoyable to play.For a game that is on par with Minecraft and 7 Days to Die, it holds it's ground extremly well			"

												As Terraria is my first sandbox, I will always look upon it fondly when I think of the genre. It will also be the standard from which I will judge other sandboxes, as it has offered so many hours of fun and exploration to me and my friends and family. It's quirky, silly, imaginative, and best of all, still growing.Story: 1/10""What the hell, Niko. This game is a sandbox- WHAT story?""As I'm reviewing Terraria against like-competitors such as Starbound and Edge of Space (both of which have some sort of story aspect), I felt the need to include this category to be fair. But yes- this is a sandbox. Stories are largely made by you, the player, even if the game has an almost-non-existent one.Gameplay: 10/10Terraria is a 2D game featuring humanoid-looking pixel characters that you can lightly-customize (hair and clothing color only) and choose the sex of. You can also choose to play in 3 different modes: Softcore, Mediumcore, and Hardcore, and 3 different world sizes: Large, Medium, and Small. Starting the game, you get a randomly-generated world and you find yourself standing next to the Guide (an NPC who is largely useless...), one of many NPCs you can attract into your base under the condition of proper accommodations and certain additional requirements. The game cycles through night and day, with night being particular dangerous to new players as it spawns much stronger monsters. Like other sandboxes, you gather raw materials to build a myriad of upgrades in armor, weapons, and tools. Unlike other sandboxes, Terraria features hundreds of different blocks and options for you to create the ultimate dream base and many different options for you to customize your appearance through armor and vanity items. There are bosses for the various stages of the game that you are at and some spawn at random. Additionally, events (both random and spawnable) occur in the world as you play it. Controls: 9/10You move/jump using the standard WASD/SPACE keys and interact with objects with your mouse. Combat is relatively smooth and mostly easy to navigate.Replayability: 10/10I have over 300 hours logged, so that already speaks for itself; in case it didn't: Terraria is a game that you pay for once (and for almost dirt cheap if you get it on sale) and it continues to get substantial updates AT NO COST to the players. Replayability is high, on this merit alone.Fun: 10/10The game has so many quirks between its bosses, building possibilities, and character customizations that you can't help but be drawn in to its world. Playing with friends means exploring together and sometimes, dying horrible deaths together (and grave markers won't let you forget it!)Conclusion:Terraria is love. Terraria is life. "

												Combining a fully destructible environment that you can rebuild to your liking with combat that will remind you of classic platformers of the past, this game is a must own!Although some people like to compare it to Minecraft because of the ability to build and craft things, Terraria is more focused on combat. Most of your resource gathering is going to be finding better metals and items so you can upgrade your weapons and armor (and this game has a ton of neat weapons and armor!) to take on even tougher monsters and bosses. Because of this, the real fun of the game is in the progression. Don't cheat yourself out of the experience by having a highly geared friend come along and give you top tier gear and rush you through the end game. Instead, convince them to re-roll a new character and start on a fresh world with you. Either of you can focus on a melee, magic, or ranged build of various types, so there's always plenty of replayability.Sadly, this replayability is somewhat finite. After defeating all of the bosses and getting top level items, there's not much left to do except building. And as I mentioned before, this isn't really the focus of the game. Still, Terraria is one of those games you will find yourself coming back to every few months to playAt the asking price of $9.99, Terraria is worth it, but it can often found on sale for $2.49. Snatch up a few copies at that price and pass them out to your friends! You'll all be glad you did!			"

												An amazingly addictive side scroller where the objective is to explore and there is a lot to explore. From dungeons, to deserts, and from the ocean all the way to hell. I guarantee you will have an amazing time. You can craft almost anything as well. You can craft weapons, beds, grandfather clocks, gargoyle statues, grappling hooks and a lot more. Tired of work? Well, why don't you have a nice cold beer. That's right you can brew your own beer. In all seriousness, this is an amazing title and I highly recommend it to all.			"

												Terraria is a game where you dig constantly to get materials so you can build your 2D dream house so a bunch of stupid freeloaders can come live in your house and charge you money to buy their stuff. I pay you!? F*ck you guys, pay me rent! This is my f*ckin' house!After the first 15 minutes you end up thinking, what the heck am I supposed to be doing, simply put.1 - Build a house, so zombies leave you alone2 - Go on Terraria Wiki and find out what exactly it is, your really supposed to do3 - Kill everything.Picked this up for 2.49 on a steam sale.. figured what the heck, I don't need to take the bus today... might as well spend the money on something. It's a great little indi game. I recommend it if you want to spend the next couple of days hooked on something you probably ought not waste your life on.			"

												Explore the darkest corners of your mind to build wonderful creations, and find out just how skillful you are with the well paced and beautifully designed boss battles. The perfect combination of a building game and an ARPG-Platformer. I think of Terraria as an upgraded Minecraft mixed with an upgraded Torchlight II. It is a wonderful experience that any gamer should have, or at least try out. Give it a go, you won't regret it!EDIT: this was written two years ago, and now I've come to play it for over 1000 hours, and I still get back to it from time to time, with the same impact and the same addictive gameplay that I know and love. The devs keep adding amazing content to it and the game never ends, you can play it forever and enjoy every minute of it. This is why I nominated Terraria for the ""Test of Time"" award.			"

												This game, is a MASTER PIECE of video game technology, combining unlimited space exploration with the tradition zombie survival scenario that we see in such classics like ""Donkey Kong 64"" and ""Diddy Kong Racing"". But when we really get down to it, Terraria is really just a ""Halo ODST"" clone that managed to make it past all the others and dazzle it's wet nips in the air as they glistened ever so sweetly across all the other great games like ""Call of Duty : Modern Warfareday"" ""Modern Warfareday II"" and we can't forget ""Super Mario Bros. 2"". Yes Terraria truly is the greatest game made to date, and after the creators of this gumball machine saw how popular it was they decided to take Terraria in a new direction and went into ""Show-Bzzzzzzz"" and made a move after the game which later will turn into a series, the first of this new movie adaption was titled ""The Hobbit"" now while some might argue that they did not in fact create that movie or help in any way towards it I always tell them. l2aim scrub get on my level 342.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333halflife33333333333333333rec.

												What can I say to do this game justice? I really like this game, from the countless hours I've enjoyed mining with the music changing depending on what biome/depth level I'm in. I've enjoyed creating blocking houses while looking on with envy at the screenshots of amazing buildings people have created. Killing some of the many bosses with abundant equipment drops. Getting my butt handed to me countless times. Falling to my death while constructing and generally derping off way more times than I care to admit.                                                                                                                                    I don't know, I just enjoy this game in it's entirety. From that moment when you find your first wooden boomarang,the moment you find your first spear, the moment when you dig straight into hell and fall into a pit of lava.                                                                                                                                                          There is always something new happening. Many bosses to kill and maim you untill you go full badass and womp em. Build your equipment up as a mage/fighter/ranged weapon user, or just combo everything! Armor sets that give you bonuses to everything from crit chances to mana and extra summons. I can totally understand how this game might not be for everyone but it has a style that just clicks with me. I whole heartedly recommend this game. Can you survive in this world and make it to hard mode? Or will you be crushed by the slimes and zombies?I've played this game off and on for a while recently been getting back into it, thought it'd be a good time to do a review.Not sure about the quality of my review though.Oh yes! NPC's build housing for you Npc's and you can start a village and get some people to set up shop! From simple Merchants to Gun salesmen! Make use of the guide if you don't know what to do/craft next show him an Item and he will show you what you need to finish an item Weapon/Armor/Trinkets/thingies.They have a hardcore mode if you wish to test yourself, with every map being randomized with equipment in chests and biomes tons of replayability.  You can also wear a bucket on your head.			"

												  Absolutely enjoyable and addicting, Terraria succeeds in the cave/dungeon-style of gameplay. While there is no traditional experience bar or player skills, the vast quantity of gear in Terraria makes up for the inability to define your class stats wise. Boss battles are a MUST to progress, and the arena to fight them in, for the majority of them, are yours to create.A very important note: Play with friends.  Everything is better when friends are doing the same thing, and Terraria is no exception. A simple LAN connection between two or more friends can bring more enjoyment out of Terraria, not to mention helping out during a boss battle or escorting to retrieve your/their lost goods if you/they die.

												An all around great game, hundreds of hours hours of gameplay, good to play by your self or with a friend(or friends). Surprisingly difficult, but every victory is hard earned in this game. Plenty of opportunity for grand buildings, or dirt huts if that's what you prefer. A great variety of weapons to choose from. Want to play as a gun slinger, archer, or a swordsman? well you're in luck, all these are possible and many others as well, you can even mix and match if you want! Lots of memorable (occasionally hair pulling, and head to key board too) bosses that add a good challenge and a great sense of progression to the game. Being a 2-D, side scrolling, sandbox like game, it has a surprisingly large amount of content, definitely worth getting.			"

												If you've always wanted to grapple hook yourself to a wall and swing a lightsaber wildly at a swarm of bats in a cave while screaming ""leave me alone! I'm trying to mine this gold!"", this game is for you.The basic premise of Terraria is one of fighting monsters, exploring magical lands, digging holes, building crazy things and finding cool stuff.This game has... quite possibly... every possible thing.It has laser guns, underground jungles, lightsabers, zombies, rocket boots, dungeons, miniguns, unicorns, master swords, sky islands, web-slingers, clowns, grenades, lava caves, diving gear, boxing glove cannons, fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles, rats, climbing claws, slimes, enchanted boomerangs, fire swords, hoverboards, giant mushrooms, flame throwers, diggy holes, boulder traps, flying carpets, poison darts, rocket launchers, man-eating plants, explosive bunnies, snowballs, bananas, lucky horseshoes and even an umbrella!

												It's a very good 2D platformer/adventure/RPG game, and cheap at that. Features creative enviroments along with unique and stylish NPCs, blocks, items, and more.     Terraria, The biggest sandbox game on steam (21 people on my friends list have it, just as proof), this game is very recommended from me. I've spent about 400+ hours into this game so far just from the past updates. With every update that comes along, me and my friends are always willing to brave this new patch and see what the troll developer Redigit has added this time that will make us ""GAME WHAT THE FIDDLESTICKS"". Terraria is full of funny and original ideas, it's nothing like minecraft if you want to get technical. Without going on to the wiki, you can enjoy and get immersed into the game much deeper without being told and just taking the steps down the road to endgame. Terraria is  VERY fun experience with friends, as we've created all new characters, and create maps for more than 10 times, where we go chugging through old challenges that we used to have difficulty with. Terraria in my opinion couldn't get old in a way where the games content is thick enough for anyone with freetime to enjoy in anyway.    THE CREATIVE ASPECT : (8.5/10) Yes, the game brings you with alot of ideas and motivations to build create and prosper a world, but without a freebuild system (Infinite supplies) in the game, it's hard to go try to start to build your great idea, but then run out of supplies to even begin to start building. Have the resources been dried up around your house? This forces you out of the safety radius and you have to obtain these supplies otherways. Chests around have blocks and bars which you can use to craft and build with and make things look beautiful. Giving this 8.5 on creative aspect because there is no freebuild is kind of hard, but yes. Your creation can come to life, with stuff inside there, like NPCs, and actual lights with switchs. You can make a mansion and it feels like your in GOD MOTHERmmmmmmmm HOTEL MARIO LIKE NPCS STOP OPENING THE DOORS    THE CHARACTER CREATION : (9/10) There are many possibilities you have to create a character that looks exactly like you. Now, part of the character creation is a part of the GAME game part of Terraria. You cannot choose your clothes in that menu. Items can be crafted, or found, however to better suit your needs. Tophats can be found during a slaughter of zombies and eyeballs trying to bring down your town or mansion with all their might. The other thing that kind of brings down this part of the game that there are alot of weird and (in my own opinion) unused haircuts that were added in a recent patch. They could've added better cuts, yes. It's not bad that they made these haircuts, they aren't trash but as their not the best thing in the window, you know?    THE GAME ITSELF : (10/10) The game itself is a wonderful masterpiece put together, besides all the collection items and haircuts and such. If you're good enough, you can skip the first boss and go face the next boss. Certain bosses you have to kill to progress so you can unlock the next place. The game doesn't use cheesy jokes either. In the dungeon, Skeletron can only be summoned at night, and The Wall of Flesh unlocks hardmode. There is a bit more but I dont want to fully spoil this for someone who hasn't played through hardmode yet. The platforming in the game is really spot on. Your jumps are wide and you have clear understanding where you're going to land. There is a knockback factor to this, where you have to do a little dodging and juking to avoid and kill the other stuff around you. In the progression part, NPCs are a really big help. The arms dealer sells a weapon that can make you do DRAMATIC difference of damage. The Merchant sells you basic needs and helps you along with housing and such. The dryad can help you remove corruption and crimson. Those are important in Terraria for you need housing to get NPCs, difference in damage is a smart idea to invest in when you're new to the game. if you wanna see skilled, look up Yrimir. He can probably help you go along in your journey.There's probably alot of mistakes, errors, and other ducks I didn't noticeTLDR Platforming Adventure where it's a combo of somewhat WoW, but also Mario.

												Okay, this will be the first review I write, so like countless others have said, here we go:The game is wonderful, I have never encountered a bug in this game, and the reason being because the company that owns the game does such a beautiful job patching bugs and updating the game constantly (they're always adding new and exciting things!)The game play is extremely refreshing. There is something about the game play that reminds me of my wonderful times playing Cave Story, and god I love that game. It may be just me, but I can compare Terraria with Cave Story, and that's not a bad thing. Now, the art-style. All of my love, I find it so neat, and very cute!! (slimes!!!) (and countless other wild life I can go around capturing with my bug net which I then proceed to let free & flood my house full of birds and bugs!) I would like to add that in this game, you build, build, build. If that does not tickle your fancy, then you can wage war on the forces of evil at night, or fight beneath the surface (and even in the sky!) OR if still that does not suit you, then go out and explore your world which is randomly generated each time, so exploring is never a bore as the map is different each and every time! Choose between small, medium, and larger worlds accordingly to your tastes and jump in!And yet, even more~ you create your character before jumping into the world of Terraria, customize your character and name him/her whatever you'd like and set the difficulty of the game to what you'd like. Softcore is set up in a such a way that if you die, you lose all of your money (which you can still run back to and try to collect), medium, where you lose all money as well as items, and hard core, where your death is permanent! (Perfect for an all-nighter with friends!)Trying to stay alive is an adventure in this game, even death. Getting back to the loot you dropped when you died  is a quest and an adventure in and of itsself. Such is the world of Terrarria.BUT! You don't have to face the wrath of Terraria alone! Hop in with some friends and start slaying/crafting/building/catching/swimming/drowni- ARHGDR too many things! Too many gerunds!  Setting up a server for you and your friends is easy! The program to create your own server can be found within your Terraria folder. You can also choose to utilize other methods, if you desire.  Recently, one of my friends gifted Terraria to a friend who did not have it, so now the three of us are playing & exploring. Not to mention the time where we plunged to our deaths on a rope that was much too short, or that one time where we stepped on a preassure plate and activated a dart trap, and then proceeded to run around like chickens with their heads cut off, setting the trap off, again. (Luckily, none of us died. haha)I'm such a bad guide/reviewer that I was not able to go through EVERYTHING Terraria has to offer (Just too many things to talk about!). (Did I mention items you equip into your equipment slots show on your character?! OMG!!) but I decided that I have written enough, and because my word-count is probably higher than the word-count in my English class essays. (Maybe... Just... maybe... haha) Hopefully, I have at least enticed you into plunging into this beautiful, yet dangerous world.(I would like to add that I first bought this game on the console and only recently bought the PC version (YES! I bought the game twice!!), so the hours I have under my belt shown here are very deceiving numbers to my actual hours playing this game. The snails are so cute!!!)So, I think its high-time you discovered the millions of things I did not go through in my review. We are not born into this world ""all-knowing"", we must learn and then apply what we know.Welcome to the world, Terraria.			"

												Terraria is a game that has kept me entertained for hours, With all the bosses and item to collect. There is so much more to do than just sit around and chop trees all day. If your into the sandbox and adventure style of games I think you would enjoy this I would recommend it to you if you like sandbox, Building, fighting pvp or just working with friends.			"

												Terraria is an amazing game, complete with a challenge and loads of fun even after you have played for hundreds of hours. As you progress through the game, delving deep into the world of Terraria, you encounter NPCs, save goblins, fight pirates, kill a wall made of flesh, battle against the corruption of a world, and have a ton of fun doing it. 11/10: A must-buy			"

												Terraria is a 2D co-op exploration and building game with dungeon crawling and hack and slash elements that makes for a really good time. I don't recommend playing this game alone as you won't find any enjoyment from mining up gear and fighting bosses when you don't have anyone to share that with, on the other hand once you have a friend or group of friends to experience Terraria with then you'll find it to be a highly interesting game.It's important to note that this isn't a deep game (In the figurative sense, literally it is actually pretty deep),  and you aren't going to find your self playing the game forever as eventually the game runs out of content. The worst thing I have to say about the game is that the experience can become a hollow experience eventually. The reason for this however is that it is an exploratory game by nature, and the less you know about it the better. By learning this game with your friends you'll find that it is a perfect way to spend upwards of a hundred hours cooperating across worlds to grow your knowledge and power.Lastly, don't compare this game to Minecraft, you won't get anywhere.

There is even the umbrella to fall slower. For the different worlds too._ Cave Story (PC): for the caves obviously.Great musics too, like the games mentionned above.			"

												Terraria is a really nice game, although some may say ""So much like Minecraft, just 2D"" I say otherwise, this game has a LOT more than Minecraft without mods...World Genaration:The world genaration is pretty cool I guess, randomly makes a world at your picking of what size it is (small, medium or large) and then well if you want you could keep it or just make a new one, does not take that long.Character Customization:The character cuztomization is pretty simple aswel, as you can pick the colour of your character, male or female, and all those other things.Weapons: Heres where things get interesting, there are A LOT OF WEAPONS around over... 150ish and if you want to get them all you need to either craft them, find them, NPC's to get them.Armours: A lot of cool armours in the game, each armour gives you a buff if you have the entire set, such as a speed bost, or +2 armour points, but there are a lot more than that, and like the weapons, you craft them, find them and kill NPC's for them.NPC's:NPC mean Non-Playing Character, so basically AI (Artificial Intelligence). There are NPC's that will try to kill you (zombies, demon eyes, slimes, etc). And some that you need to make houses for to have them sell stuff with you and allow you to sell stuff to them, you unlock these NPC's in different ways, wether it be reaching a certain amount of money, finding a certain item, or killing a certain boss, and each NPC need a room to stay in, or else they will not move in, although you do start of with one.Tools:Most of the tools can be used as weapons, sometimes you need a certain ""tier"" of a tool to mine certain blocks, for example, you can't mine obsidian with a copper pickaxe. So you need to work towards getting better tools to help you get better armours and weapons.So all in all I do really like this game, as you can see bu how much I have played it. I hope you found this helpful, sorry if I have made any typos and have a nice day!			"

												I never expected Terraria to be so addictive. Initially, upon purchase, I expected it to be some sort of 2D minecraft clone, where you just explore and build stuff. Never have I been so wrong. As you can see, at the time of this review, I have close to 400 hours in this game, which is more than any game I have ever played. Don't let the graphics of the game or the fact that the game is a 2D game throw you off. The graphics, while odd at first, eventually becomes so endearing you cannot imagine the game with any other graphics.Somehow, I can't place my finger on what makes the game so fun. It might be the sense of adventure as you journey through the underground in search of chests and loot. Or maybe it's the sense of thrill you get, fighting hordes of enemies while dangerously close to plunging to your death in lava. Or it could be due to the surprise you get, being blown up by explosives while peacefully exploring the caverns. The sense of relief and adrenaline as you narrowly escape death from enemies with just 6 health remaining, with your friends frantically trying to rescue you. Getting greedy as you spot a rare ore, only to be killed by a well placed trap. Overestimating yourself and trying to fight an enemy that slays you seconds later.There's always a sense of progression in this game, you get to fight increasingly tougher bosses, Yet it isn't forced, you can always play at your own pace. You can choose to rush through the game in order to get to the more challenging (and more fun) hardmode. Or you can take your time slowly exploring through the caves and jungles. Or you can choose to fish, getting load of great loot that way. The visual effects of the combat is absolutely stunning lategame, with so many unique weapons that you just want to try it all.Overall, this is a game I would highly recommend, great for playing with friends or just mucking about.ProsSense of adventureGreat co-opCool weapons lategameProgressionConsBoring in SingleplayerSteep learning curveNeed to rely on game wiki			"

PROS:+ cool gameplay+ creative concept of ""build what you want""+ tons of crafting recipes+ appealing old-school graphics+ recent new content and multiplayer enhancement+ achievements are nicely designed to outline how to progressCONS:- the monster spawning mechanic is weird sometimes- a bit difficult for beginners to get the bulding concepts- couple of monster clipping issuesComment:A good game that will eat your time like there is no tomorrow! Comparison of gameplay with Minecraft is not wrong, however this game offers a bit more when it comes to combat. Multiplayer in it has been enhanced and is really the best way to play since interacting with your friends is great. I recommend it to anyone who likes to build stuff and has TONS of free time on their hands!			"

												A Truly pleasant and addictive game. Terraria it has a unique feel, as it perfectly mix the Building system into a RPG game. As you start playing, it's very easy to lose yourself in the game, because you don´t actually know what to do. But by the time you start building your home and workbench, you realize that the choices or armors, weapons and items you can craft are imense. But building and crafting is just a part of this game, you also can fight agains monsters and zombies and actually there are bosses with their own tactics. Combine this with the feeling of exploration and you have, in my opinion, a great game to enjoy it with your friends, or even, alone in your unique world. And also...watching four guys fully dedicated to decorate an house,it's something you wont see in any game.  "

												You may think, ""PHOOEY I have heard about this sandbox block builder game and it sounds JUST LIKE MINECRAFT""   well its not, with delightfully fun graphics and well made controls. Terraria is easy to learn, has several bosses and over 1,000 items to make or find.But okay, you want to hear the BAD stuff, well there are a few things that you should know, the characters and items are quite small compared to the screen, The world size can be chosen at the start but the worlds are not infinite, Servers are hard to set up or join, and while most of the bosses are  very fun, the last three require a lot of grinding for materials before you can beat them. But other than those few things, its a GREAT GAME.so if you are considering getting it, I would say that if you think you'll like it, you'll like it. so go ahead build anything, the non infinite terraria sky is the limit!

												An incredibly fun game! Would definitely recommend! I *forced* my friend to buy the game. She was doubtful at first, but she loves the game now!Biomes: The game has very many different biomes, so it's much to explore! They all have an interesting look, their own different monsters and its own music soundtrack. Awesome!Monsters: There are tons of different monsters in the game! They all have nice designs, and drop different items. Cool!Bosses: The bosses have very epic designs, like so epic you go ""Wow"" when you see it! They have cool background music and their own combat style. I love the bosses very much!Items: There are almost 3000 items in the game! That is A LOT! There are many weapons to choose from, as swords, bows, guns, throwing, boomerang, spears, staffs, spelltomes, yoyos... There is also very much different armor to choose from. They can benefit your damage, mobility, meelee speed, health regen, and much more. They have cool designs too, and if that's not enough already, you can also dye them with colors to make them look cooler. There are also accessories, which benefit different things.Building: With very many blocks to choose from, and so many variations of furniture, and cool decorations, the combinations are nearly endless! You can also paint the walls and blocks with many different colors to increase the possibilities even more!You can set your house wherever you feel like; on the ground, in the air, on an flying island, in a cave, in the lake, even in hell, if you so feel like it.In Terraria there are so many things to do. So much exploring, many items to find, bosses to slay, and houses to build. It takes very long to do all the things in Terraria, which I like, so that you never really get bored with new stuff to do all the time. You can play with friends to make it 10x as fun. If the game is too easy for you, which I doubt it is, there is Expert mode!Tl;dr: Get Terraria. I rate 10/10.			"

												My absolute favourite game. The fact it becomes many, many times more enjoyable with somebody you care about cannot be understated. Play it with a family member, a loved one or a close friend - or many!THE hands down best games on steam for those who more than two of:2D gamesPlatformersFighting gamesCraftingBuildingShootingGrappling hooksMultiplayer coopRPG gamesOpen woldProcedural world generationNon-linear gameplay (create your own story)Boss fightsBOSS FIGHTSBOSS LOOTSO many ITEMSSO much to CRAFTCasual gameplayHardcore gameplayExpert modeStill here?FREQUENT UPDATES, 5 YEARS after its releaseModding capabilitiesController supportLAN playOffline playAMAZING soundtrackThings Terraria DOESNT have:Game-breaking bugsSplit-screenA story mode (the game has a strength-based progression though - you wont be able to defeat the stronger enemies without crafting or finding better gear, which sets you up for a ""level"" system completely based on your own skill, and of course luck.Endless worlds. They are created before you enter them, so they DO have a finite size. They are usually very large, though.Recommendations: Find a good friend/girlfriend/boyfriend/sibling/parent or three to play with this. Learning the game is the most fun part of the experience, and that experience is not only best shared - it makes getting the hang of things a lot easier, as well as exploring a lot more fun.You like roleplaying? Terraria is good for that.You like not dying? Better get ready to play your extreme best, in that case. This is the dark souls of 2D games.go buy it. It's not just worth it on a sale - the game is worth buying for the price of its 4-pack!			"

												It's time for my first review. To me personally,Terraria is the first game that came to mind. This game has so much to offer. The art style is wonderful, and I prefer it over any 3D game like Minecraft. The flat perspective by all means does not take away from the gameplay in the least. The controls are super simple and is a great starter for a large range of ages. Crafting sometimes becomes complicated, but with the guide it's not that big of an issue at all, and even though the wiki isn't entirely complete it helps solve most of the questions about that. The fact that the world has a huge range of different biomes to explore really keeps the game interesting. With the randomization of worlds when they are created as well, it's another interesting feature that not everyone will end up with the same items, and it takes multiple world explorations to get specific items. I definitely recommend softcore difficulty to begin with, however. Playing Terraria like one would play Minecraft can cause a lot of trouble and frustration that can take away from your experience as you reach a halt in your progress. It's similar to Pokemon. Beat it first, then do a Nuzlocke replay.The only complaint I have with the game is the hassle it is trying to get the multiplayer to work. There have been several occasions where it's taken hours to get the connection to work, and sometimes even then we call it quits before we can get the server up. When the multiplayer does work, however, it really is a great time and spices up the gameplay. I just wish it wasn't so frustrating to work sometimes.Overall this game is absolutely fantastic and will remain one of my staple games for blowing freetime and having fun with my friends for a long, long time. 9/10.

												Everybody should try this game at least once, it's dirt cheap and you can get so much out of it.A sort of metroidvania minecraft-esque game; explore a huge and varied world, collect buttloads of stuff, fight more enemies then you can shake a stick at, destroy leagues of bosses. New players will find themselves overwhelmed at the amount of content in this game. Gameplay mechanics are very fluid and intuitive, and have only improved with successive updates.With the recent 1.3 update now is a better time then ever to get on board if you haven't already (and if you have, well, why are you reading this?).

												Terraria is... I don't know I have over 4,000 hours in this game which is really unhealthy but I don't care as i'm still playing it... you can never get away from Terraria it hooks you can you never get unhooked you may stop for a bit but you never really stop. Terraria has tons of stuff to see. it puts you in a world and you ask yourself what the heck do I do? so you go to the wiki... and find out what  to do and after that you should be able to find out what to do on your own. Terraria is a very grindy game you will be farming items for hours and get nothing but when you do get the thing you wanted it feels so good. overall Terraria is amazing and I would give it a 10/10			"

												EDIT: After over 600 hours and my most played game of my library, I must say. For $2.50 on sale, this game has given me the most worth of any game in my library. Fantastic deal even at full price. A truly great game.One of the most enjoyable games I've ever played! Terraria is a survival-type 2D game where you build houses, mine, explore, and fight epic bosses. You can also play with friends for more awesomeness. So much content and a playthrough takes about 30 hours. (EDIT: With recent updates a playthrough is more like 50-100 hours) Totally recommend it to anyone who likes adventure/fighting/survival/2D games.And one other thing, this game has no resemblance to Minecraft. The only things that are similar is that you have a pickaxe, an axe, dirt blocks, irone ore, and stone... but other than that it is incredibly unique! It truly is a great game and has given me literally 100s of hours of enjoyment.			"

												I really like this game, developers keep on delivering updates to us, which makes me to comeback to it every time to see more stuff they added into game. Some might say that this is Minecraft rip-off... No. It's not, this is absolutelly different game, with it's unique 2D feel in it. I love implementation of magic along normal weapons. It almost feels like 2D RPG, but It's not. My favorite thing along with killing bosses and getting all stylish with all accessories and costumes is enhancing gumbling, litteraly, you can spend all your gold on getting your weapon best enhancing possible and might not get it.If you are looking for 2D-kinda-platformer-kinda-RPG-kinda-survival, look no further, this game is made for you.You also can try Expert mode, makes Terraria even more challenging, almost like Super Meatboy.

												Given it's regularly dirt cheap in sales, plus the fun gameplay and sheer amount of content in the base game, Terraria has to rank right at the top in value for money among all the games in the Steam store. There really aren't many criticisms I could make. At worst I could say the inventory and crafting menu occasionally feels a little inconveniently designed. Highly recommended.Edit: It's 2016 and they're still updating the game, as if there weren't enough content already. Best devs ever.			"

												Looking for an Indie game with a lot of fun? Terraria's for you.It somewhat lacks logic, bo I guess this is its main charm and why it makes that so good.Freedom to pick your own playstyle as well as choose between classes, but you're not completely restricted to them.Huge variety of weaponry, armors, accesories, many mobs, mounts, everything you need to fight all these huge amounts of mobs or bosses.Every playthrough yields different experience, so you don't get bored too easily.Also you can be mainly a builder type and believe me, you are able to build beautiful things in this game, if you're skilled and patient enough. Pixel art is in option too.And in contrary to popular belief, Terraria IS NOT like, nor a copy of Minecraft. Justifying it by saying ""these are games with blocks and building"" is a complete nonsense overused by kids, since there's Trove with really high votes and people don't complain.Both differ in many aspects, the first one goes far, far away from the latter, most notably with its fighting system or countless amounts of different mobs, overall graphics and its theme. Only RNGesus may troll you sometimes, but guess that's how this system works, after all.Either playing alone, making some runs or just for fun with friends, this is an amazing game. You can spend hundreds of hours and you still won't be able to complete it in 100%.I definitely recommend to buy it for those who consider it. Worth spending money and it's quite often on sales.Oh and by the way, don't get swarmed by ridiculousness of this game.			"

												It's like taking Minecraft and showering it with creativity. Terraria succeeds where Minecraft fails by adapating crafting and mining elements and mixing them with what a gamer would want to play with. Swords of the earth, katanas, magic water wands, space guns, and even a variation of lightsabers! This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what this game has to offer, as the bosses are creative with each being unique in its own right. The story is left for you to uncover and you are able to choose how you want to advance through the game at your own pace. The developers really take advantage of the side-scrolling perspective of the game and blend it together with concepts that could only be achieved with Terraria. And if you ever get bored of the traditional experience, there's multiplayer, servers, mods, and modded multiplayer! While it doesn't have a definitive ""creative mode"", fan-software such as tEdit easily compensate and work smoothly.			"

												    A lot of people will say this game is just like 2D Minecraft. The thing is, most of those people have less than an hour on record of this game. The only reason this could be compared to Minecraft is that it has blocks. That's it. Minecraft is a great game, but it and Terraria are two different things. Terraria has hundreds more items to explore and craft, more enemies and bosses to fight and earn rewards, more underground places to explore, and overall more of a sense of true adventure rather than just a sandbox/survival game. It can be confusing at times, but that's why they give you a guide at the beginning! Also, the Terraria wiki has everything you could possibly want to know about the game. Overall this game is amazing and fun, especially with the new 1.3 update! I totally recommend this game!   (Also, many people complain that they thought Mac support would be added in 1.3 and say that their money is ""wasted."" The problem is, right under the game screen it says right there what you need to have to play this game. Just read the requirements BEFORE you buy the game so no money is wasted.)			"

												Terraria is a 2D co-op exploration and building game with dungeon crawling and hack and slash elements that makes for a really good time. I don't recommend playing this game alone as you won't find any enjoyment from mining up gear and fighting bosses when you don't have anyone to share that with, on the other hand once you have a friend or group of friends to experience Terraria with then you'll find it to be a highly interesting game.It's important to note that this isn't a deep game (In the figurative sense, literally it is actually pretty deep),  and you aren't going to find your self playing the game forever as eventually the game runs out of content. The worst thing I have to say about the game is that the experience can become a hollow experience eventually. The reason for this however is that it is an exploratory game by nature, and the less you know about it the better. By learning this game with your friends you'll find that it is a perfect way to spend upwards of a hundred hours cooperating across worlds to grow your knowledge and power.Lastly, don't compare this game to Minecraft, you won't get anywhere.

												This game, is a MASTER PIECE of video game technology, combining unlimited space exploration with the tradition zombie survival scenario that we see in such classics like ""Donkey Kong 64"" and ""Diddy Kong Racing"". But when we really get down to it, Terraria is really just a ""Halo ODST"" clone that managed to make it past all the others and dazzle it's wet nips in the air as they glistened ever so sweetly across all the other great games like ""Call of Duty : Modern Warfareday"" ""Modern Warfareday II"" and we can't forget ""Super Mario Bros. 2"". Yes Terraria truly is the greatest game made to date, and after the creators of this gumball machine saw how popular it was they decided to take Terraria in a new direction and went into ""Show-Bzzzzzzz"" and made a move after the game which later will turn into a series, the first of this new movie adaption was titled ""The Hobbit"" now while some might argue that they did not in fact create that movie or help in any way towards it I always tell them. l2aim scrub get on my level 342.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333halflife33333333333333333rec.

												A Truly pleasant and addictive game. Terraria it has a unique feel, as it perfectly mix the Building system into a RPG game. As you start playing, it's very easy to lose yourself in the game, because you don´t actually know what to do. But by the time you start building your home and workbench, you realize that the choices or armors, weapons and items you can craft are imense. But building and crafting is just a part of this game, you also can fight agains monsters and zombies and actually there are bosses with their own tactics. Combine this with the feeling of exploration and you have, in my opinion, a great game to enjoy it with your friends, or even, alone in your unique world. And also...watching four guys fully dedicated to decorate an house,it's something you wont see in any game.  "

												Many people explain terraria as ""2D Minecraft"", and i can see where they're coming from, but the differences between the 2 are massive. first of all, you probably won't find any 11 year olds shouting that they lost their diamonds to some glitch. and if you do, it would be hilarious to watch them try fight any of the hardmode bosses. Next of all, terraria is MUCH bigger then minecraft. it has spell, bosses, Many different weapons choices and paths, loads and loads of items and The god that is the Terra Blade. if you think this is another minecraft game, and you over look it, please don't, or you will miss out on a fantastic game			"

												It's a fun sandbox multiplayer adventure game; it has a rich story and good plotline, but it still leaves almost every choice up to you with the sandbox and open world mechanics. It is certainly the best 2D ""Block-Like"" game I own.			"

												Honestly, this game has been with me through thick and thin, through all my family and school troubles, it's been there slowly updating, giving me new things to do, more awesome items to enjoy, more events, more everything. I realize not everyone can or will have the same experience i did but thats ok, because this game is given a special spot in the minds of those who play it, and enjoy it.Now for some people this type of game just isn't your cup of tea, and i understand that people have different tastes, but if you bought this game because it was cheep and had good reviews started playing it and thought it was boring, or you could'nt get into it, then i have to tell you this games major flaw, it's beginning, there are plenty of folk on my friends list who have 20 minutes in this game because of exactly that, they thought the whole game would be like the start, and it's not the best most meaty part of the game is the middle, where you have the most fun and spend the most time, theres a lot of reasons for this and you really ought to see them for yourself. So if you are one of those people who bought the game and quit early, or even if your thinking about buying i'd say two things: number one, Buy it, it's worth whatever it's on sale for and more, and number two, give it a second chance power through the start of the game and really see where it shines. Overall i give this game a perfect 10/10 would recommend.			"

												I avoided Terraria for a while on the basis that it looked like a sidescrolling Minecraft. I'm glad someone talked me into giving it a try.It's true that you mine, craft, and build with blocks like so many other games but this one cuts all the excess wandering around and leaves only the fun stuff. It gives you the freedom to do absolutely nothing while encouraging you to explore by rewarding you for searching out special boss enemies and exploring the world.I equated it to other block-based building games just because it had block units. After I gave it a chance I'm glad to say it feels much more completed and unique than other similar games. If you're a fan of sidescrolling adventure games or creative sandbox games, I'd highly recommend giving Terraria a try.			"

 Terraria  Do you like sandbox games then should definietly try this game. Game is not the the hardest one abd our goal is to create a character and develop it, build our shelter, which must serve a residence for the NPC, look for useful objects and create them, to make the mines and defeat the boss's by increasingly dig down to hell to defeat the next boss and unlock the Hardcore mode and new items and minerals. This title is great to play with friends, pleasant background music, killing monsters and death does not mean anything because we only lose the gold which can not even be well spent. According to me it is a very enjoyable game to play alone or with friends, and it is definitely worth a try.  "

												Over the course of the past 3 years, I have come to respect this game greatly.It isn't just a simple minecraft clone, 'nor is it just some platformer with the ability to build.It's much more than that, it's a world filled with creativity, terror, friendly characters, monsters, caves, labyrinths, a plethora of weapons, and whatever sized dirt house you want to make (just so long as it's below 8400 X 2400 blocks).The game starts off fairly simple, with relatively intuitive gameplay for a new user (tools work much like they do in most sandbox games) and a few simple slimey things that you can hit with your sword.After some time you get better at killing the Slimes, have built your hole of dirt in the ground, and feel like there must be more to this game. So you explore.Whether you explore vertically by tunneling and going through caves, or walking through the landscape above, you're bound to run into some sort of enemy problem.You die in some grotesque manner with lots of blood involved and respawn back where you first started (unless you're a god and somehow get to the end of the game without dying). And so the thrill of exploring begins again! With more dying involved!Over time you get stronger and stronger as you find yourself exploring more of the world you're in. You pick up magical items and build mansions (or more dirt houses) for your townspeople to live in. You kill a few bosses, outline your class (mage, ranged, warrior, summoner), find some cool looking places and destroy everything that lives inside them.Then you slowly tunnel into the Underworld, which is pretty much Hell. You get even better equipment and learn that you can make the game harder by beating  yet another boss. So you go for it and eventually beat the poop out of it.Then you die.And die again.And probably die a few more times until you actually get even better equipment(!!)Through this you unlock:More bosses to killMore enemies to slaughterMore amazing weapons and accessories to build and equipMore bosses, enemies, wepaons, etc, etc, etc.Until you finally have come to the end-game. You always had the option to do whatever you wanted to do, you could have used this as a farming simulator and brewed potions for fun. But instead you went ahead and decided to achieve an amazing feat. All thanks to you having picked up this masterpiece.Well done.			"

												Terraria is arguably the greatest and most unique 2D sandbox platformer out there. Its combination of typical sandbox elements with unforgiving RPG progression provides both incentive and reward. The amount of content is perfect even before mods, and the progression is satisfying as the player upgrades to each tier and defeats each boss. Some people claim that it's basically minecraft. It isn't. It's an RPG and a platformer, with a unique art style and unique mechanics. Minecraft is a 3D sandbox with little progression which focuses on the user's willingness to build structures and devices, and while this is possible in Terraria, is by no means the main aim of the game.All in all, an amazing 2D platformer with both sandbox and RPG elements unlike any other out there, promising hours and hours of fun.

												It's a very good 2D platformer/adventure/RPG game, and cheap at that. Features creative enviroments along with unique and stylish NPCs, blocks, items, and more.     Terraria, The biggest sandbox game on steam (21 people on my friends list have it, just as proof), this game is very recommended from me. I've spent about 400+ hours into this game so far just from the past updates. With every update that comes along, me and my friends are always willing to brave this new patch and see what the troll developer Redigit has added this time that will make us ""GAME WHAT THE FIDDLESTICKS"". Terraria is full of funny and original ideas, it's nothing like minecraft if you want to get technical. Without going on to the wiki, you can enjoy and get immersed into the game much deeper without being told and just taking the steps down the road to endgame. Terraria is  VERY fun experience with friends, as we've created all new characters, and create maps for more than 10 times, where we go chugging through old challenges that we used to have difficulty with. Terraria in my opinion couldn't get old in a way where the games content is thick enough for anyone with freetime to enjoy in anyway.    THE CREATIVE ASPECT : (8.5/10) Yes, the game brings you with alot of ideas and motivations to build create and prosper a world, but without a freebuild system (Infinite supplies) in the game, it's hard to go try to start to build your great idea, but then run out of supplies to even begin to start building. Have the resources been dried up around your house? This forces you out of the safety radius and you have to obtain these supplies otherways. Chests around have blocks and bars which you can use to craft and build with and make things look beautiful. Giving this 8.5 on creative aspect because there is no freebuild is kind of hard, but yes. Your creation can come to life, with stuff inside there, like NPCs, and actual lights with switchs. You can make a mansion and it feels like your in GOD MOTHERmmmmmmmm HOTEL MARIO LIKE NPCS STOP OPENING THE DOORS    THE CHARACTER CREATION : (9/10) There are many possibilities you have to create a character that looks exactly like you. Now, part of the character creation is a part of the GAME game part of Terraria. You cannot choose your clothes in that menu. Items can be crafted, or found, however to better suit your needs. Tophats can be found during a slaughter of zombies and eyeballs trying to bring down your town or mansion with all their might. The other thing that kind of brings down this part of the game that there are alot of weird and (in my own opinion) unused haircuts that were added in a recent patch. They could've added better cuts, yes. It's not bad that they made these haircuts, they aren't trash but as their not the best thing in the window, you know?    THE GAME ITSELF : (10/10) The game itself is a wonderful masterpiece put together, besides all the collection items and haircuts and such. If you're good enough, you can skip the first boss and go face the next boss. Certain bosses you have to kill to progress so you can unlock the next place. The game doesn't use cheesy jokes either. In the dungeon, Skeletron can only be summoned at night, and The Wall of Flesh unlocks hardmode. There is a bit more but I dont want to fully spoil this for someone who hasn't played through hardmode yet. The platforming in the game is really spot on. Your jumps are wide and you have clear understanding where you're going to land. There is a knockback factor to this, where you have to do a little dodging and juking to avoid and kill the other stuff around you. In the progression part, NPCs are a really big help. The arms dealer sells a weapon that can make you do DRAMATIC difference of damage. The Merchant sells you basic needs and helps you along with housing and such. The dryad can help you remove corruption and crimson. Those are important in Terraria for you need housing to get NPCs, difference in damage is a smart idea to invest in when you're new to the game. if you wanna see skilled, look up Yrimir. He can probably help you go along in your journey.There's probably alot of mistakes, errors, and other ducks I didn't noticeTLDR Platforming Adventure where it's a combo of somewhat WoW, but also Mario.

												Inspired by Lockean philosophy, Terraria draws heavily from Chapter V of John Locke's Second Treatise of Government. The game's map creator alludes to a God-like being who first creates the world then populates it with humans. Everyone within is then given the world ""for the support and comfort of their being"" (or ""character,"" in the game's context). However, if the world belongs to everyone, how can we appropriate its resources for particular individuals to make use of them? In Terraria, a player via the character can extract the natural resources from the land and its wild creatures, which initially belonged to all, and mix their own labor with the natural resources to create something unique; this created product then belongs to the character due to the labor placed within it. The game mechanics follow Locke's original law of nature rather closely; they do an amateur but lovely job educating on the state of nature envisioned in the Treatise.			"

												Best game in its genre.Often compared to Minecraft, and that may be somewhat true, in that there is crafting from materials gathered from the game world, however, Terraria is a lot more action orientated. And in my opinion, a heck of a lot more fun.There is fantastic progression of challenges and equipment. Really intense and fun boss fights. Hundreds of interesting and quirky items. Everything from the music, to the animations is just pure excellence.On top of all these amazing qualities, the developers are some of the most generous devs I've ever seen. Since Terraria was officially released, they have released two massive content patches (1.1 and 1.2) that added more content than most games would include in a full expansion. Content patch 1.3 is around the corner and hints at even more content, all included in the original purchase of the game.I can't rate this game any higher, it is truly excellent and has so much charm. Definitely pick it up if you are on the fence.			"

												Has the same ""just one more block"" addictiveness as Minecraft.A lot of people compare Terraria to Minecraft. Minecraft (in 3D) focuses more on creative aspects, with some character advancement. Terraria (in 2D) focuses more on RPG/character progression aspects, with plenty of creative opportunities. Minecraft has more generated content, while Terraria has more hand-crafted content. Minecraft has fewer unique items, fewer varieties of monsters, etc. Terraria has more variety, but is limited to 2 dimensions.In multiplayer with a fair number of players, a world quickly becomes swiss cheese; riddled with holes. There is limited space, and limited resources. The server I play on has a mod that places more statues and treasure chests over time so that there's always new loot. By comparison, Minecraft doesn't suffer from this problem because (a) it has an infinitely-large world, and (b) it's in 3 dimensions.			"

												My initial evaluation of Terraria was: ""It's the poor man's Minecraft.""After a bunch of hours playing both titles, I've concluded that Terraria's more fun as well.I've never seen a game with the same level of love and dedication from its developers.  With each version patch comes an incredible amount of new content - always completely free of charge - that gives new life to the game, and keeps Terraria fun to play even years after buying it.I can't explain why doing something so monotonous is so fun.  It's not even like the monotony of leveling in an MMO because there's no leveling in Terraria.  It's just digging, killing, and building (with an x1000 on the digging part).  But it works.  It's a blast, and you should own it.			"

												Terraria is a fantastic mix of Metroidvania-style exploration and combat, lego building and a random number generator.You can generate worlds from small to large and harvest ore, wood and other resources to build your dream home. You can also upgrade your equipment and use it to battle numerous enemies and bosses that populate your world.The sky's the limit! No wait, space is the limit. Build your home in space!At any rate, there's a lot of variety and freedom to do whatever you want.Of course, there are caveats. People who prefer a game with more direction might not appreciate Terraria, as it can be easy to get lost in it and be uncertain how to progress. The endgame can be pretty unforgiving too as the sloppy combat makes it difficult to dodge bosses and said bosses often rely on a lot of projectiles and high stats to get the job done.But these are minor smudges on an otherwise amazing game.

Terraria is easy to learn, has several bosses and over 1,000 items to make or find.But okay, you want to hear the BAD stuff, well there are a few things that you should know, the characters and items are quite small compared to the screen, The world size can be chosen at the start but the worlds are not infinite, Servers are hard to set up or join, and while most of the bosses are  very fun, the last three require a lot of grinding for materials before you can beat them. But other than those few things, its a GREAT GAME.so if you are considering getting it, I would say that if you think you'll like it, you'll like it. so go ahead build anything, the non infinite terraria sky is the limit!

												It's like taking Minecraft and showering it with creativity. Terraria succeeds where Minecraft fails by adapating crafting and mining elements and mixing them with what a gamer would want to play with. Swords of the earth, katanas, magic water wands, space guns, and even a variation of lightsabers! This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what this game has to offer, as the bosses are creative with each being unique in its own right. The story is left for you to uncover and you are able to choose how you want to advance through the game at your own pace. The developers really take advantage of the side-scrolling perspective of the game and blend it together with concepts that could only be achieved with Terraria. And if you ever get bored of the traditional experience, there's multiplayer, servers, mods, and modded multiplayer! While it doesn't have a definitive ""creative mode"", fan-software such as tEdit easily compensate and work smoothly.			"

												    A lot of people will say this game is just like 2D Minecraft. The thing is, most of those people have less than an hour on record of this game. The only reason this could be compared to Minecraft is that it has blocks. That's it. Minecraft is a great game, but it and Terraria are two different things. Terraria has hundreds more items to explore and craft, more enemies and bosses to fight and earn rewards, more underground places to explore, and overall more of a sense of true adventure rather than just a sandbox/survival game. It can be confusing at times, but that's why they give you a guide at the beginning! Also, the Terraria wiki has everything you could possibly want to know about the game. Overall this game is amazing and fun, especially with the new 1.3 update! I totally recommend this game!   (Also, many people complain that they thought Mac support would be added in 1.3 and say that their money is ""wasted."" The problem is, right under the game screen it says right there what you need to have to play this game. Just read the requirements BEFORE you buy the game so no money is wasted.)			"

The bosses are fun o fight and you will always get a good feeling when job finally get that one weapon item or whatever you've always wanted. The art style is very pleasing and this game will never ever get boring. This game is THE BEST IN THE WORLD and if you buy it you will not regret it all my friend, not at all.			"

												Such a fun game, keeps me playing for hours and hours, and it has basicly become a race to getting all the items in the game. You are always ungrading equipment or trying to get a new stronger weapon from some rare mob drop which sometimes leave you farming an area for some time. The best part is sterminating the bosses once your equipment and armour have gotten strong enough.			"

												I used to think this game was a Minecraft ripoff, Boy i was wrong.This game has alot of potential and has a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of content even when its still 1.3 (3646 Items D:)1 POINT ♥♥♥♥ING 3. By the time the version is 2.0 We probobly had like 5,000+ Items.I dont really enjoy games with this type of category but terraria surprised me.  Come on guys, Terraria isn't even a survival game. What's up with the misleading tag? I pretty muchI spent almost 2 years waiting for the update and it was worth it, unlike Minecraft's Bountiful Update which i played for only 20 minutes and eventually got bored of it. But for terraria the 1.3 could take hundreds of playtime, Even more than 500 hours which is the point where i should get a girlfriendAnd keep up with those updates too, Redigit. You've been a great success.			"

												My absolute favourite game. The fact it becomes many, many times more enjoyable with somebody you care about cannot be understated. Play it with a family member, a loved one or a close friend - or many!THE hands down best games on steam for those who more than two of:2D gamesPlatformersFighting gamesCraftingBuildingShootingGrappling hooksMultiplayer coopRPG gamesOpen woldProcedural world generationNon-linear gameplay (create your own story)Boss fightsBOSS FIGHTSBOSS LOOTSO many ITEMSSO much to CRAFTCasual gameplayHardcore gameplayExpert modeStill here?FREQUENT UPDATES, 5 YEARS after its releaseModding capabilitiesController supportLAN playOffline playAMAZING soundtrackThings Terraria DOESNT have:Game-breaking bugsSplit-screenA story mode (the game has a strength-based progression though - you wont be able to defeat the stronger enemies without crafting or finding better gear, which sets you up for a ""level"" system completely based on your own skill, and of course luck.Endless worlds. They are created before you enter them, so they DO have a finite size. They are usually very large, though.Recommendations: Find a good friend/girlfriend/boyfriend/sibling/parent or three to play with this. Learning the game is the most fun part of the experience, and that experience is not only best shared - it makes getting the hang of things a lot easier, as well as exploring a lot more fun.You like roleplaying? Terraria is good for that.You like not dying? Better get ready to play your extreme best, in that case. This is the dark souls of 2D games.go buy it. It's not just worth it on a sale - the game is worth buying for the price of its 4-pack!			"

												It's time for my first review. To me personally,Terraria is the first game that came to mind. This game has so much to offer. The art style is wonderful, and I prefer it over any 3D game like Minecraft. The flat perspective by all means does not take away from the gameplay in the least. The controls are super simple and is a great starter for a large range of ages. Crafting sometimes becomes complicated, but with the guide it's not that big of an issue at all, and even though the wiki isn't entirely complete it helps solve most of the questions about that. The fact that the world has a huge range of different biomes to explore really keeps the game interesting. With the randomization of worlds when they are created as well, it's another interesting feature that not everyone will end up with the same items, and it takes multiple world explorations to get specific items. I definitely recommend softcore difficulty to begin with, however. Playing Terraria like one would play Minecraft can cause a lot of trouble and frustration that can take away from your experience as you reach a halt in your progress. It's similar to Pokemon. Beat it first, then do a Nuzlocke replay.The only complaint I have with the game is the hassle it is trying to get the multiplayer to work. There have been several occasions where it's taken hours to get the connection to work, and sometimes even then we call it quits before we can get the server up. When the multiplayer does work, however, it really is a great time and spices up the gameplay. I just wish it wasn't so frustrating to work sometimes.Overall this game is absolutely fantastic and will remain one of my staple games for blowing freetime and having fun with my friends for a long, long time. 9/10.

												Terraria! Is it kinda like Minecraft? Well yeah, in the building way. 2D building blocks. That's all. However, compared to minecraft, Terraria is a more action packed game. Featuring many different bosses, weapons of all sorts... vanity items, and household items. All the different types of monsters (bosses included), different with each type of Biome. Jungles possess a hidden Temple, and sometimes you can find underground pyramids in your desert! If you like clothes, you have a plethora of vanity items to choose from to fully customize your character! And dyes to to color both your clothes... and house (via the painter)!All in all, its a really fun game you can play both offline and online. This game can be played in a very simple manner... or a complex way :)			"

												This game is good for all ages. It is an adventure game with many bosses and many blocks to make amazing structures and homes with. I also enjoy the npc feature. If you make homes and do things that spark their interests, npcs will move in to help you. Some of the npcs are: The Nurse who heals you, The Dryad who sells you stuff and shows you the status of your world, and of course Santa Clause who sells you holiday things. Another great thing is that you can make a character, and go into other servers with it which means you keep your stuff. So basically you can get stuff in your world, than play with your friend with the same character. To sum it all up AWESOME GAME			"

												    A lot of people will say this game is just like 2D Minecraft. The thing is, most of those people have less than an hour on record of this game. The only reason this could be compared to Minecraft is that it has blocks. That's it. Minecraft is a great game, but it and Terraria are two different things. Terraria has hundreds more items to explore and craft, more enemies and bosses to fight and earn rewards, more underground places to explore, and overall more of a sense of true adventure rather than just a sandbox/survival game. It can be confusing at times, but that's why they give you a guide at the beginning! Also, the Terraria wiki has everything you could possibly want to know about the game. Overall this game is amazing and fun, especially with the new 1.3 update! I totally recommend this game!   (Also, many people complain that they thought Mac support would be added in 1.3 and say that their money is ""wasted."" The problem is, right under the game screen it says right there what you need to have to play this game. Just read the requirements BEFORE you buy the game so no money is wasted.)			"

												Over the course of the past 3 years, I have come to respect this game greatly.It isn't just a simple minecraft clone, 'nor is it just some platformer with the ability to build.It's much more than that, it's a world filled with creativity, terror, friendly characters, monsters, caves, labyrinths, a plethora of weapons, and whatever sized dirt house you want to make (just so long as it's below 8400 X 2400 blocks).The game starts off fairly simple, with relatively intuitive gameplay for a new user (tools work much like they do in most sandbox games) and a few simple slimey things that you can hit with your sword.After some time you get better at killing the Slimes, have built your hole of dirt in the ground, and feel like there must be more to this game. So you explore.Whether you explore vertically by tunneling and going through caves, or walking through the landscape above, you're bound to run into some sort of enemy problem.You die in some grotesque manner with lots of blood involved and respawn back where you first started (unless you're a god and somehow get to the end of the game without dying). And so the thrill of exploring begins again! With more dying involved!Over time you get stronger and stronger as you find yourself exploring more of the world you're in. You pick up magical items and build mansions (or more dirt houses) for your townspeople to live in. You kill a few bosses, outline your class (mage, ranged, warrior, summoner), find some cool looking places and destroy everything that lives inside them.Then you slowly tunnel into the Underworld, which is pretty much Hell. You get even better equipment and learn that you can make the game harder by beating  yet another boss. So you go for it and eventually beat the poop out of it.Then you die.And die again.And probably die a few more times until you actually get even better equipment(!!)Through this you unlock:More bosses to killMore enemies to slaughterMore amazing weapons and accessories to build and equipMore bosses, enemies, wepaons, etc, etc, etc.Until you finally have come to the end-game. You always had the option to do whatever you wanted to do, you could have used this as a farming simulator and brewed potions for fun. But instead you went ahead and decided to achieve an amazing feat. All thanks to you having picked up this masterpiece.Well done.			"

												This game is cool. It's kinda like Minecraft, but more complex in term of items and quests. Also this game has NPCs, which make the game more interesting. Unlike minecraft, you can earn money by killing mobs and monters. There are way more monsters in Terraria than minecraft. The average gameplay also longer than minecraft. But in multi-player, I think minecraft would be a better choice. Overall the game is fun to play strongly recommend to play with 2 - 4 people.			"

The visuals are really clean and it the style looks retro and modern at the same time. The enemies and bosses are challenging and fun and the biomes and dungeons are crazy. There's so much gears and items in this game, you probably won't get bored in like 500 hours. The soundtrack is one of the best assets in this game, it's so good, if there wasn't the soundtrack that there is now then I probably would't enjoy the game at all. Yes the soundtrack IS that good. 10/10 thanks for reading,			"

												Hours on record should speak for themselves, and I almost fully recommend this game - Those lacking a creative side will get their money's worth on sale, but if you're not a fan of building you probably won't find much to do once the progression is ""complete"".On the other hand, if you're a creative person you'll never run out of things to do.Regardless of your levels of creativity, anyone that can play regularly with a group of friends will find the game entertaining from start to finish.

												I'm not really good at these reviews, so I'll keep it short and simple.I love this game for 4 main reasons:1. Progression and Action - You start from nothing and begin to gather things, getting stronger and fighting tougher foes, until you're the toughest meat around.2. Grinding and Farming - There are a lot of items in this game, and some are very rare. Expect lots of grinding and farming.3. Building and Wiring - Loads of different blocks, furniture and other decorations to pimp up your builds. Wiring system to build automatic farms and contraptions to make the grinding a bit easier.4. Art and Music - The artstyle fits perfectly for a game like this, and the music is just amazing.			"

												While I have only spent 19 hours on this game as I write this, (that isn't a lot compared to others) I have to say that I love this game. A lot of people compare it to Minecraft and Starbound. I've never heard of Starbound so I can't compare, but I've had Minecraft for over a year and they are similar. Besides the fact that Minecraft is 3d and not 2d, they are different aswell. Terraria has many more items, more bosses, and more monsters to deal with.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes being creative, mainly with building. It might be a bit confusing at first what to do, but you will get the hang of it quickly. And the price of it is great. Pretty cheap. I got it on sell for $2.49, but $9.99 is also a great price for a game like this. I haven't seen any bugs also, so I give it a 10/10.			"

												This is a nice game, is worth the buy. There is something for almost everyone: If you like to mine, you can mine; if you cant to build, you can build; if you want to fish, you can fish; if you want to explore, you can explore; and best of all, if you like to FIGHT, you can FIGHT!Pros:-Like I said, big variety of activities to do in this game.-You'll love this game if you both are solo or with friends.-The game is so big, you will have to spend hours and hours to have the best loadout.-PVP mode funny and you get a lot of laughs playing it with your friends.-Easy to make a server and host it to play with your friends.-Mods made by community are aviable, no supported by Terraria's developers though.Cons:-You'll need to check a wiki about this game a lot of times, because there is no more guide from the game than the first NPC Guide.-Maybe mine is very useless, you can get better equipment killing bosses and looking for chests, and mining is not worth at all.-The Corruption/Crimson and the Hallow are very overpowered, they become annoying and its hard to stop/remove them.-Not very good traductions, but this is acceptable though.Final: This is a 'worth-the-money' game, it brings you a lot of hours of intense gameplay, and/or funny moments playing it with your friends. I love it and their developers are doing from it a very good game with every update, what is unexpected in the most games nowadays. And Im waiting for Terraria 2, I think I would instabuy it.PD: Sorry if I had some mistakes, Im not from USA/Britain. "

Terraria ReviewInformation About the GameTerrarai is a 2D platform game in which you create a custom character and enter your own world which can either be small, medium or large. Think mine craft but 2D, you go out an explore and then build, with occasional enemies and bosses to fight along the way.The ReviewI started playing Terraria when a friend told me its a must have game and something to do while the sever we played on was down, when I first got the game I didn't think much of it because everything was either done or I didn't have the equipment to do anything but things changed when I started my own server and explored the world and read all the wiki links(http://terraria.wikia.com/wiki/Terraria_Wiki) on how to build and make euipment. People say Terraira is only fun when your on with friends but in my opinion the games is fun to the extent of you own imagination regardless of friends playing or not. The enemies and bosses can sometimes be a bit overpowered and annoying when your are truing to build and constantly being hit by pixies or the overpowered pinks ones with laser beams.The RatingI would say yes Terraria is a fantastic game even with the new updates but it dose get a bit repetitive if you constantly killing pixies over and over and over again so this does hurt the game a lot and wish for when Terraria 2 comes out that the problem will be dealt with. So in sum Terraria needs a few more things adding to make it one of the greats hopefully Terraria 2 will fix this.Thanks for reading Cash			"

												Its worth paying for. Terraria is a wide game if you give the time for it.I think many people who have JUST heard of Terraria may think its a Minecraft but 2D. Some of them are right, but are also wrong too.The Plot:I wouldn't really say a plot is in Terraria. How i would put it is like this:You arrived in a land, alien to what it normally is, around you is wood, water, a man, and varoius landscapes. Your move.Gameplay:This is the games beef. All the weapons and gear you find is intresting. some of them refrence games, like Pixel Piracy. some armor and vanity wear does too. The building in Terraria is also a great aspect. adding minecarts, and wire for electricity. You can nearly build anything you want. In 2D of course.Graphically it does not shine honestly, but graphics are not everything to a game. But honestly, the combat is solid, yeah its point and click but it feels so satisfying when you swing your sword and the guts of a zombie fly away. The Bosses do prove a challenge to the new player. I mean when I fought the Eye of Cthulhu yeah i was like: ""OH GOD WHAT DO I DO!?"" but then the first few bosses do teach you to use what you got honestly. If you play A Link to Terraria, which honestly is a great map if you like Zelda and Terraria. But back to the game.Protecting your land is a important part if you want to keep your NPC's safe too, since there are invasion battles like the goblin army. I personally take it as an endurance round. Cause thats what it basically is.Overall, if i had to rate Terraria. it would be a 9/10I'll re-edit this for 1.3! :D			"

												This is a really great 2D, action, adventure, sandbox game. Before you allow naysayers to make you doubt buying and enjoying this game, consider all the positive reviews first and make sure you gave it a fair chance.When Terraria was first released, I myself had been a Minecraft player. So as you can guess my first thoughts about it were, ""Someone made a clone of Minecraft?"". However, instead of leaving it at that I decided to actually look into the game and eventually bought it out of curiosity for its 2d side scrolling and simplistic design. I found that Terraria although small when it was first released, was a very fun and addictive game. As the game has received a vast amount of updates the content has changed greatly. It has become a well thought out and a finely crafted game. ;) On a serious note, this game has many features and a variety of content I don't think you will find readily anywhere else in this type of game. You can easily play this game for hours solo or with friends, generating worlds can be wildly different, and to obtain some items you may even have to generate 2 or 3 worlds just to find them. I don't want to spoil anything but please note: You can easily get through the game without having the items that all possible worlds can generate. I mainly want to emphasize that you can play new worlds and continue the adventure. After playing this game for many months I quit for a short while, when I returned to play again, the updates allowed me to create a new world and a new character, and still enjoy the same parts of the game I had played in the past, but now with new mechanics and items and even new npcs.Aside from my personal experiences with this game here are some Pro's and Con's.Pro's:Lots of content for hours of play.Solo or Multi-player options.Tons of items and materials.Many npcs and in game events.Smooth combat system.Creative bosses, monsters, and npcs.Con's:As the world is 2D, buildings tend to be simple and square at first, but can be fully developed thanks to placeable items and back walls. (Check out the screen shots for some awesome builds)The world only generates once based on the size you pick, leaving a finite ammount of materials for one map.Screen shots are a pain to take and paste together to show off large buildings. (Developers have revealed a new update, allowing for larger screen shots. Yay!)Overall there is a lot of content for this game, many items to craft, monsters, and more planned updates. If you like to build, this is a great game with many options to build marvellous structures.If you like to adventure with friends, this is a very fun game to take down bosses together, and build better weapons and armour with the resources you find and earn.Thank you for taking the time to read my review for Terraria, I hope this helps you make the right decision for you, and that you are happy, which ever way you should go. :)			"

												Now before you dismiss it as a Minecraft clone, here are some reasons why Terraria is better than Minecraft.1. The Amount of ContentThe amount of content is Terraria is astounding for such a simplistic game. As of version 1.2.4 the game contains over 1000 items. This includes tons of weapons, armor, and consumables.2. Low RequirementsMinecraft has low PC requirements, but Terraria requires even less. It is 2D, but don't let that fool you. The game has more than enough content to make up for its limited mobility.3. Play how you Want.Terraria allows for so many different play styles that it could take you forever to try them all. There are no set classes, so if you really want to, you can be a mage riding a hoverboard while firing off a minigun. With the main 3 playstyles focusing on Bows/Guns, Melee, and Magic, your choices are a little limited there, BUT with the amount of armor, accessory, and weapon customization available, you can create a character style that suits your playstyle.4. ChallengeNo good game goes without challenge, and Terraria has it. It's not the level of challenge present in Dark Souls, but it does have decent difficulty, especially after reaching Hard Mode. It encourages reaching new levels of armor and weapons before continuing onward.5. MultiplayerMultiplayer in Terraria is a great way to pass time with a bunch of friends. You can take on crazy events with your friends instead of doing it alone. Not to mention, your character's inventory transfers between worlds, so bring your best character in instead of making another.Overall, a fantastic game, one that is worthy of your time and money.

												With over 1000 hours on this game, I can say it gets EXTREMELY fun. No matter what you do, you'll want to grab a block and place it. Or you'll want to go and cut up some mobs. This game lets you do that, and it blows you out of your socks while you do it. There's so much to do, so much to see, you'll never know if you don't go. Smashmouth.			"

												One of the greatest games ever to be made. And it costs hardly anything. Although I feel that a lot of people won't appreciate the game because of their view of graphics having to be cutting edge. I love pixel art, so the game is great for me in that respect.Still, there's so much to do in the game, and your imagination is the limit with what you want to build, which is why the game is so successful.

												 There are so many things in Terraria I can go over but its so much that I cant fit it all on one review, so I will just go over some of the basic things about the game and keep it as breif as I can (I tend to go off on rants when talking about stuff like this, so this may not be very ""breif""). Terraria (in the words of nerdcubed) is basicly a 2D Minecraft that focuses more on crafting and dungeon crawling, were as minecraft focuses on creativity and building, with alot more content and things to do. It has a nice pixelated style that is the perfect level for the player to tell what something is and what is going on around them. The aim of the game is to make a house and gradualy progress in the game, upgrading your gear, killing bosses and building a village for the NPCs that move in. This sounds quite a bit like minecraft dont it? Just trust me, they are two very different games.  You've got so many places you can visit, such as the jungle, the dungeon or the beaches at the end of the world. minecrafts scense of scale was bigger than terraria's but in terraria, none of it goes to waste. almost all the biomes that you will find to be useful one way or another. Thats not even mentioning all the other items in the game, each one made for a spisific task. During combat, it feels, with any weapon, satisfying to kill mobs weather its a green slime, zombie or the eye of cthulhu. All the choices of weapons and accessories are very abundant, as well as decritive blocks for building homes and possibley pixel art. I would talk about the NPCs in the game but again, trying to keep it as short as I can. All around, the game Terraria is an awesome experiance that you can even share with your friends with multiplayer. There are very little problems I have with the game. its a low demanding game (computer wise) that has just the right amount of challenge to make it fun. I recomend this game to anyone who likes long survival pixelated type games.			"

												Rewriting bio, though nothing has changed. This game is spectacular. Now, here's really why - The game technically got ""finished"" as Red, the creator, moved on to Terraria: Otherworld, it's somewhat-of-a-sequel. Some Terraria devs stayed behind however, and still are updating it.I love this game in the few years I've had it, and it's definitely my second most played game on Steam as of now.If you want a basic review, in a nutshell it's 2D Minecraft IF the actual devs stayed behind to work on Minecraft. It also has a lot more content and in general is a spectacular game, and I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone, even people who think it's gonna be like Minecraft who don't like Minecraft.This above review is why I nominated it for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award' award.

												Terraria is a 2D sandbox game. The art style makes it feel like it's a retro game (2x2 pixles). It usually starts off slow, but when it picks up, it gets awesome. With 11 bosses, 3 invasion events, 3 moon events, and a wide variety of normal enemies, this game will keep you playing. There are also a ton of different weapons to kill things with. If you want to be a ranger, you can choose bows, repeaters, guns, or explosives with different ammunition. If you want to be a melee figther, you can choose spears, swords, flails, or boomerangs. Also, if you want to be mage, you can have staffs, spell books, homing projectiles, controllable projectiles, bouncing projectiles, minions, or rain attacks. There's also a lot of collectables, such as statues, clothes, and banners. I personally give this game 10/10 stars.			"

												250 hours here, and another 500+ on friend's account. BEWARE!This game is a time-eater. Terraria is, far as I know, one of the best side-scrolling sandbox games. You can build, you can mine, craft, destroy. If there are any cons. about this game, then it might be leak of RPG mechanics out of which Terraria got some, for example tiered items give us a little taste of RPG Farming and Leveling up(Here ""Gearing up"") methods of spending time. If you don't have time for such games, buy it anyway. If you have? Then enjoy this one in all its riches!Over 3000+ items of wide variety of usage, progressively changing map(even if it has limited size), Lots of bosses, monsters and traps are the only few of zillions of advantages you can take of when playing this game.Totally recommended choice. 10 Euro for this amount of content? Waaaaay too cheap. ^^			"

""Well, Terraria has mods too, atleast they're executed much more perfectly than those Minecraft mods that attempt to implement RPG/Grindfest influenced content."" replies the Terraria fan.Otherwise, as a more serious viewpoint, any time someone uses the ""Minecraft having mods"" argument against Terraria, they would have to take into account that they're claiming that unpolished RPG-esque mods (Advent of Ascension, DivineRPG, ArcanaRPG) are BETTER than a game that has superior altogether polish, even if the Minecraft fanboy/girl(s) take modpacks into account.While they may also have a say about something such as Thaumcraft and Botania, should they realize that both of which aren't even similar to Terraria at all, and only bear a small amount of content and polish as compared to Terraria itself.Carefully awaiting the storm of spite, frustration and rage to engulf me.

Each land biome consists of different creatures some kind others that will atempt to rip your face off... This game is really good especially with all weapons an items you can craft.

												First of all, I'd like to point out that only saying Terraria is exactly like Minecraft has not played in depth. There is a completely different energy to Terraria which is just perfect for a sandbox. It's peaceful at parts, and quite the opposite at others for instance when fighting one of the many bosses. I have yet to get bored of this game. Terraria in my opinion is worth more than it's current price, so definitely a bargain for such a great game.Also, the whole idea of characters is just perfect. You can have different characters which transfer their items between worlds or servers. It just works really well.I have heard people saying that this game is bad because it doesn't have a creative mode like a lot of other sandboxes, but Terraria really wouldn't suit a creative mode. Not because you can't create very good looking creations, because you certainly can, but it just really wouldn't suit one. If those people played the game properly they would soon see this to be true. Also, I'm sure there is a Terraria mod somewhere to add a creative mode for those of you who may really think it needs it.In conclusion, Terraria is a great game with very few flaws. I'ts completely worth the small price, and anyone who hasn't should really try it out. It also makes a great game for video Let's Plays.			"

												Terraria is a Great...no...AWESOME game.It has so many things to do , Craft , Explore build a Castle that reach the stars , or just dig a hole and cover yourself.Nearly 5 years after the game got released and massive content updates is still being released , and its not a one time thing !! For 5 years now we got continues updates and new content.Terraria is a sandbox game with great multiplayer for up to 8 friend , now you can Connect with steam instead of using IP connect . Expert mode was added giving terraria players old and new a new challange. With many items and furniture , including Slime , honey , bone , wood and more types of Furniture !! No two terraria worlds will ever be the same			"

 Keepin' it simple here. I'm not very good at this game, and I haven't played it much. From the very few hours I've played I can tell you that this game has no replay value whatsoever, and for some reason the graphics are really weird, almost like everything is just little, low quality squares. This game also takes less time than a Call of Duty campaign. Like seriously, this is an open world game based around resources and survival with zombies, flying eyeballs, and killer bunnies but it took less than a night to finish. And I mean a night in game.Jokes aside, I've owned this game for a while and I can tell you it's definitely worth the $10, and it often goes for $2-$3 during Steam sales. So if for some reason you can't afford the 10, the developers very often put it up for sale. After your first world is completed, you'll have the basic memory to complete another world as soon as you want. You can also take any of your characters to any of your generated worlds.  Out of trees for some reason and you don't realize the Dryad sells acorns?  Start a new random world and mow down some trees.Any of the wikipedia websites that exist for Terraria such as http://terraria.wikia.com/wiki/Terraria_Wiki and http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki are extremely helpful and I urge any of you newer players to use them. Also the Guide NPC in game can be of great help as annoying as he can be.That's all I'll cover in this review.game is gr8 m8, don't h8, and just r8 it 8/8 and go fish for that lucky gold cr8. smart cursor is your friend  "

												One of the best games I've ever played, Terraria brings you into a world where literally anything can happen. Mostly. Explore the underground jungle while holding off skeletons and hornets, destroy bosses and get their epic loot, or build towering cities above the clouds. Many people would say "" This is a 2D version of Minecraft"". Well, they're wrong. This game is original, and is equal or better than Minecraft. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone who has played a sandbox adventure game before or would like to start now!			"

Terraria ReviewInformation About the GameTerrarai is a 2D platform game in which you create a custom character and enter your own world which can either be small, medium or large. Think mine craft but 2D, you go out an explore and then build, with occasional enemies and bosses to fight along the way.The ReviewI started playing Terraria when a friend told me its a must have game and something to do while the sever we played on was down, when I first got the game I didn't think much of it because everything was either done or I didn't have the equipment to do anything but things changed when I started my own server and explored the world and read all the wiki links(http://terraria.wikia.com/wiki/Terraria_Wiki) on how to build and make euipment. People say Terraira is only fun when your on with friends but in my opinion the games is fun to the extent of you own imagination regardless of friends playing or not. The enemies and bosses can sometimes be a bit overpowered and annoying when your are truing to build and constantly being hit by pixies or the overpowered pinks ones with laser beams.The RatingI would say yes Terraria is a fantastic game even with the new updates but it dose get a bit repetitive if you constantly killing pixies over and over and over again so this does hurt the game a lot and wish for when Terraria 2 comes out that the problem will be dealt with. So in sum Terraria needs a few more things adding to make it one of the greats hopefully Terraria 2 will fix this.Thanks for reading Cash			"

												I found, when I started playing Terraria, that it was like: ""Here's a world, now go play."" And this really frustrated me. The Guide isn't the brightest bulb in the box, but atleast in 1.3 he can shoot arrows. But once I had discovered the Terraria Wiki,I found this game was really fun! Building in Terraria is incredibly well done, the combat system has a few flaws, but it's very entertaining. But most of all, just the pure gameplay. Can you think of a 2D platformer, where you are raiding a lost jungle temple, where your weapon is a wasp shooting gun, and your grappling hook is slimey. WOW. And this is the start.The whole battle aspect of the game is very enriching, when paired with the music. You can battle martians with a LAZER MACHINE GUN, kill pirates with a NYAN CAT SWORD, kill a goblin army with a SNOWMAN CANNON, or kill a rain of slime and their king with a SANDGUN.I love this game.All I have to say, is that you have to get this game			"

												So I figured that I would sit and write a review after 800 hours of playing this game. And then 1.3 came out and there went another 200+ hours... So it's not like Terraria needs the reviews, but I just feel the need to give it the ol Thumbs Up cuz it's really freakin good. The English language doesn't have a word for it, but I beleive the Japanese do, and I don't remember it. The Possiblities and variations this game creates are so good that I now look for games to buy on steam comparing each one to Terraria and realizing that nothing will ever measure up to Terraria. It has the most content. The best procedrally generated worlds. Tons of enemies and bosses to fight. And with 1.3 it even has a bit of a story line (but not really cuz there is 0 dialogue to support a story line, except the idea that you are the hero of the world. But that's okay cuz the story is so good it doesn't need one).Plus Multiplayer....... In most games saying mp is the same as sp can be seen as negative. In Terraria that is so not the case. For each player on a world armies and legions and moons spawn more enemies. I am freaking out right now just trying to put the excitement into words.But Jack ""Dingus"" Douglas managed to put it like this:""If you want to be in the best shape of your life, go to a gym.If you want be a look like a great god, nah, kill a great god, buy"" this ""Program.""

												Terraria is a great game filled with trial and error as you make your way through the game.You start out by spawning in, cutting down trees, making wood armor, building a house, attacking night creatures, and so on. The enemies are very diverse; Zombies, Flying eyeballs, etc. Just because you build to survive doesn't mean it's a copy of minecraft!!!

												My very first thought was: this gotta be a Minecraft clone in 2D. I like minecraft, so why shouldnt i give this one a chance? Plus, i like Platformers, so how could i get wrong?To be honest, my first impression was a really bad one. After creating a detailed character for your adventure and choosing the world's size, you're dropped in a landscape with nothing but a guy next to you called ""guide"". The Guide gives you a few random tips, but only the first 4 or 5 are really usefull. Since the game does not provide any other form or tutorial, your first instinct is to read through all the tips. After around half of them you'll be totally confused and they'll stop making sense to someone who just played the game. The basic mechanisms of the game, such as crafting (which is REALLY essential) are not explained in detail. I had to watch tutorials on youtube in order to understand how to get started. Since there is a huge community for this game, it was not hard to find a good tutorial in no time. Still i dont think this is how it should be.			"

												Terraria is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. It dominates Minecraft. With a wide range of Weapons ranging from swords to staffs to bows and even guns. Bringing your Character to another world is awesome, Randomly generated worlds small and large, you can swim in oceans, explore pyrimids and fight crazy bosses. If you dont like this game you can literally go to hell. I Feel as if I just beat the game. And yet my adventure, has only just begun.			"

Each land biome consists of different creatures some kind others that will atempt to rip your face off... This game is really good especially with all weapons an items you can craft. The only hassel of the game (atleast for me) is having to find materials that you need to proceed further in the game, that i cant get without dying over and over agian. 7/10 good game.			"

It helps if you jump into this game with a little knowledge of what to expect, or use the wiki to help you, because honestly this game can be overwhelming with the sheer amount of items and things you can make. Not to mention the amount of bosses and special ""events""(waves of enimies and bosses) that you can fight.			"

												Terraria is a 2D sandbox game. The art style makes it feel like it's a retro game (2x2 pixles). It usually starts off slow, but when it picks up, it gets awesome. With 11 bosses, 3 invasion events, 3 moon events, and a wide variety of normal enemies, this game will keep you playing. There are also a ton of different weapons to kill things with. If you want to be a ranger, you can choose bows, repeaters, guns, or explosives with different ammunition. If you want to be a melee figther, you can choose spears, swords, flails, or boomerangs. Also, if you want to be mage, you can have staffs, spell books, homing projectiles, controllable projectiles, bouncing projectiles, minions, or rain attacks. There's also a lot of collectables, such as statues, clothes, and banners. I personally give this game 10/10 stars.			"

												 There are so many things in Terraria I can go over but its so much that I cant fit it all on one review, so I will just go over some of the basic things about the game and keep it as breif as I can (I tend to go off on rants when talking about stuff like this, so this may not be very ""breif""). Terraria (in the words of nerdcubed) is basicly a 2D Minecraft that focuses more on crafting and dungeon crawling, were as minecraft focuses on creativity and building, with alot more content and things to do. It has a nice pixelated style that is the perfect level for the player to tell what something is and what is going on around them. The aim of the game is to make a house and gradualy progress in the game, upgrading your gear, killing bosses and building a village for the NPCs that move in. This sounds quite a bit like minecraft dont it? Just trust me, they are two very different games.  You've got so many places you can visit, such as the jungle, the dungeon or the beaches at the end of the world. minecrafts scense of scale was bigger than terraria's but in terraria, none of it goes to waste. almost all the biomes that you will find to be useful one way or another. Thats not even mentioning all the other items in the game, each one made for a spisific task. During combat, it feels, with any weapon, satisfying to kill mobs weather its a green slime, zombie or the eye of cthulhu. All the choices of weapons and accessories are very abundant, as well as decritive blocks for building homes and possibley pixel art. I would talk about the NPCs in the game but again, trying to keep it as short as I can. All around, the game Terraria is an awesome experiance that you can even share with your friends with multiplayer. There are very little problems I have with the game. its a low demanding game (computer wise) that has just the right amount of challenge to make it fun. I recomend this game to anyone who likes long survival pixelated type games.			"

												Now before you dismiss it as a Minecraft clone, here are some reasons why Terraria is better than Minecraft.1. The Amount of ContentThe amount of content is Terraria is astounding for such a simplistic game. As of version 1.2.4 the game contains over 1000 items. This includes tons of weapons, armor, and consumables.2. Low RequirementsMinecraft has low PC requirements, but Terraria requires even less. It is 2D, but don't let that fool you. The game has more than enough content to make up for its limited mobility.3. Play how you Want.Terraria allows for so many different play styles that it could take you forever to try them all. There are no set classes, so if you really want to, you can be a mage riding a hoverboard while firing off a minigun. With the main 3 playstyles focusing on Bows/Guns, Melee, and Magic, your choices are a little limited there, BUT with the amount of armor, accessory, and weapon customization available, you can create a character style that suits your playstyle.4. ChallengeNo good game goes without challenge, and Terraria has it. It's not the level of challenge present in Dark Souls, but it does have decent difficulty, especially after reaching Hard Mode. It encourages reaching new levels of armor and weapons before continuing onward.5. MultiplayerMultiplayer in Terraria is a great way to pass time with a bunch of friends. You can take on crazy events with your friends instead of doing it alone. Not to mention, your character's inventory transfers between worlds, so bring your best character in instead of making another.Overall, a fantastic game, one that is worthy of your time and money.

												Its worth paying for. Terraria is a wide game if you give the time for it.I think many people who have JUST heard of Terraria may think its a Minecraft but 2D. Some of them are right, but are also wrong too.The Plot:I wouldn't really say a plot is in Terraria. How i would put it is like this:You arrived in a land, alien to what it normally is, around you is wood, water, a man, and varoius landscapes. Your move.Gameplay:This is the games beef. All the weapons and gear you find is intresting. some of them refrence games, like Pixel Piracy. some armor and vanity wear does too. The building in Terraria is also a great aspect. adding minecarts, and wire for electricity. You can nearly build anything you want. In 2D of course.Graphically it does not shine honestly, but graphics are not everything to a game. But honestly, the combat is solid, yeah its point and click but it feels so satisfying when you swing your sword and the guts of a zombie fly away. The Bosses do prove a challenge to the new player. I mean when I fought the Eye of Cthulhu yeah i was like: ""OH GOD WHAT DO I DO!?"" but then the first few bosses do teach you to use what you got honestly. If you play A Link to Terraria, which honestly is a great map if you like Zelda and Terraria. But back to the game.Protecting your land is a important part if you want to keep your NPC's safe too, since there are invasion battles like the goblin army. I personally take it as an endurance round. Cause thats what it basically is.Overall, if i had to rate Terraria. it would be a 9/10I'll re-edit this for 1.3! :D			"

												Rewriting bio, though nothing has changed. This game is spectacular. Now, here's really why - The game technically got ""finished"" as Red, the creator, moved on to Terraria: Otherworld, it's somewhat-of-a-sequel. Some Terraria devs stayed behind however, and still are updating it.I love this game in the few years I've had it, and it's definitely my second most played game on Steam as of now.If you want a basic review, in a nutshell it's 2D Minecraft IF the actual devs stayed behind to work on Minecraft. It also has a lot more content and in general is a spectacular game, and I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone, even people who think it's gonna be like Minecraft who don't like Minecraft.This above review is why I nominated it for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award' award.

												Now before you dismiss it as a Minecraft clone, here are some reasons why Terraria is better than Minecraft.1. The Amount of ContentThe amount of content is Terraria is astounding for such a simplistic game. As of version 1.2.4 the game contains over 1000 items. This includes tons of weapons, armor, and consumables.2. Low RequirementsMinecraft has low PC requirements, but Terraria requires even less. It is 2D, but don't let that fool you. The game has more than enough content to make up for its limited mobility.3. Play how you Want.Terraria allows for so many different play styles that it could take you forever to try them all. There are no set classes, so if you really want to, you can be a mage riding a hoverboard while firing off a minigun. With the main 3 playstyles focusing on Bows/Guns, Melee, and Magic, your choices are a little limited there, BUT with the amount of armor, accessory, and weapon customization available, you can create a character style that suits your playstyle.4. ChallengeNo good game goes without challenge, and Terraria has it. It's not the level of challenge present in Dark Souls, but it does have decent difficulty, especially after reaching Hard Mode. It encourages reaching new levels of armor and weapons before continuing onward.5. MultiplayerMultiplayer in Terraria is a great way to pass time with a bunch of friends. You can take on crazy events with your friends instead of doing it alone. Not to mention, your character's inventory transfers between worlds, so bring your best character in instead of making another.Overall, a fantastic game, one that is worthy of your time and money.

												With over 1000 hours on this game, I can say it gets EXTREMELY fun. No matter what you do, you'll want to grab a block and place it. Or you'll want to go and cut up some mobs. This game lets you do that, and it blows you out of your socks while you do it. There's so much to do, so much to see, you'll never know if you don't go. Smashmouth.			"

This game stands on it's own with it's own flair of weapons, mobs, and bosses.  Not to mention the amount of items and the varying biomes.  A great game to play with, especially with friends!			"

												It's a really good game, thousands of hours of content 110+ hours in and I still find items that I never heard of in the wiki.Review here:Terraria puts you in a world with a few crappy tools- I mean COPPER tools; and then you see a nice peaceful land with green grass, tall trees, butterflies, bunnies, and ponds. But then you chop down a tree and a bunny comes into the axe, and is then, murdered, then you know that crap gets real now, there is no escape. You gather some more wood then proceed to build a house, because you went too far and saw bloody/purple evil land with monsters that that took the crap out of you. After your glorious house is finished, it gets dark, and zombies and eyeballs and lions oh my! appear, You bunker down in your house and watch as your guide friend gets ripped apart by monsters.That is day one. Good luckPros and Cons (I love these)Pros+ Lots of bosses+ Lots of areas+ Lots of weapon types+ Lots of classes you can play as+ Lots of area+ Lots of enemies+ Lots of NPCs+ Lots of blocks+ Lots of interesting items+ Lots of character customization+ Lots of armour+ Lots of extras-boosts-items-trinkets-accssessories things+ Lots of dru- Potions+ Lots of content+ Lots of LotsCons- I wasted my life on this, you should tooBottom line, Buy it 11/10 "

												One of the greatest games ever to be made. And it costs hardly anything. Although I feel that a lot of people won't appreciate the game because of their view of graphics having to be cutting edge. I love pixel art, so the game is great for me in that respect.Still, there's so much to do in the game, and your imagination is the limit with what you want to build, which is why the game is so successful.

												Terraria is a 2D sandbox game. The art style makes it feel like it's a retro game (2x2 pixles). It usually starts off slow, but when it picks up, it gets awesome. With 11 bosses, 3 invasion events, 3 moon events, and a wide variety of normal enemies, this game will keep you playing. There are also a ton of different weapons to kill things with. If you want to be a ranger, you can choose bows, repeaters, guns, or explosives with different ammunition. If you want to be a melee figther, you can choose spears, swords, flails, or boomerangs. Also, if you want to be mage, you can have staffs, spell books, homing projectiles, controllable projectiles, bouncing projectiles, minions, or rain attacks. There's also a lot of collectables, such as statues, clothes, and banners. I personally give this game 10/10 stars.			"

												2D minecraft? Nope!Terraria is a sandbox game where you can build in a 2D world. It is very similar to Minecraft's ""survival"" genre, but it does not offer the same gameplay features. Terraria is filled with many types of NPCs, some of which are interactive.The crafting system is also different, but also very good. You don't have to spend time searching crafting recipes, but simply have the required items to make an item and viola, the recipe would popup and you'd craft things quickly.			"

												The game is fun, you can build stuff, grind good weapons and kill bosses and then it endsalso mods. good fun mods.if you like that stuff buy itnow I'll write a review for the game Second Life(the thumbs up is for terraria)-----------Second Life Review-----------I was exploring the depths of youtube when I come across a very interesting video about a game called second life, and as I'm not such a roleplayer and all that stuff, I turned it away, but seeing as curiosity to see what cancerous adventure layed inside, I gave it a try, only to be greeted by a very small game, which as I thought would lag me and my friend to the next dimension (I want to say sorry for having you see what it held, friend), a world which gave you freedom to do what you wanted----if doing what you wanted meant being a woman peeing in a pole in the middle of the park in the way a man pees.I explored a random land which me and my friend got invited to, and as it loaded, I walked around with bad movement controls and a fixed camera which disturbed me the most. I then saw a group of people. They were dancing. Me and friend approached the group, our in-game names being YamIplayingthis and CancerGod, we observed as people danced and talked. I said nothing, as I did not know how to turn off the all talk option, only to discover then and tell my friend how ♥♥♥♥ed up that was. We saw people talking and acting like it was their lives. their entire lives. they dated, loved, danced, I don't know what people do in real life, but they did there. I saw before my eyes what it was like to abandon real life to live in the matrix as your own avatar, and the worst is, not stopping. The name of the game is exactly what it is, a second life, a life you choose to live in the place of your real one, I don't know why I'm writing a review of Second Life at a Terraria Review, but I'm, and I'm here to tell you, whoever came across this, don't play it, it's too much cancer10/10 would gain more 4 cancer tumours			"

												The game is fun, you can build stuff, grind good weapons and kill bosses and then it endsalso mods. good fun mods.if you like that stuff buy itnow I'll write a review for the game Second Life(the thumbs up is for terraria)-----------Second Life Review-----------I was exploring the depths of youtube when I come across a very interesting video about a game called second life, and as I'm not such a roleplayer and all that stuff, I turned it away, but seeing as curiosity to see what cancerous adventure layed inside, I gave it a try, only to be greeted by a very small game, which as I thought would lag me and my friend to the next dimension (I want to say sorry for having you see what it held, friend), a world which gave you freedom to do what you wanted----if doing what you wanted meant being a woman peeing in a pole in the middle of the park in the way a man pees.I explored a random land which me and my friend got invited to, and as it loaded, I walked around with bad movement controls and a fixed camera which disturbed me the most. I then saw a group of people. They were dancing. Me and friend approached the group, our in-game names being YamIplayingthis and CancerGod, we observed as people danced and talked. I said nothing, as I did not know how to turn off the all talk option, only to discover then and tell my friend how ♥♥♥♥ed up that was. We saw people talking and acting like it was their lives. their entire lives. they dated, loved, danced, I don't know what people do in real life, but they did there. I saw before my eyes what it was like to abandon real life to live in the matrix as your own avatar, and the worst is, not stopping. The name of the game is exactly what it is, a second life, a life you choose to live in the place of your real one, I don't know why I'm writing a review of Second Life at a Terraria Review, but I'm, and I'm here to tell you, whoever came across this, don't play it, it's too much cancer10/10 would gain more 4 cancer tumours			"

												Alright, lets be honest, have you known a game where you can be a guy (or gal) wearing an engineering helmet, nurse's top and a mermaid tail while wearing a pair of shoes that lets your entire body go in lava, all of which is dyed a purple-ish blue color that causes purple-ish blue flames to radiate off of you, while using a sword that fires cats that farts rainbows to beat the living crap out of a giant, overgrown wall of meat with 2 severely large eyes and a horrifically nasty set of teeth that has a bunch of smaller blobs of meat with teeth attached to the thing, which you created by throwing a voodoo doll of a guy who lets zombies into your home, while riding a UFO and getting help from a set of mechanical eyeballs that you have to fight later on in the game in the first place, to unleash the powers of bloody rainbows and shadows/horror-movie-dropouts that you had already unleashed in a completely different world 2 weeks ago, just so you can get even more enemies to murder with even more weapons to fight more bosses to fight 4 pillars that, when killed, will give you cool loot and a flying monster that you can kill to get even more weapons to screw around with to kill more enemies that will give you more money to buy more stuff to build giant fortresses that contribute to nothing but look nice so you will build them anyway?Yeah, thats what I thought.

												Terraria is a unique milestone in the evolution of the RPG/sandbox genre. It does contain many of the familiar elements present in such games: digging tunnels, building bases, crafting items, and fighting monsters. However, It ascends above its predecessors by defining a much clearer goal and purpose, emphasizing combat and exploration. Randomized worlds give you plenty of areas to explore, while dungeons and bosses offer unique challenges for you to conquer. Building and mining can give more than just shelter and resources, as you can construct tactical fields or arenas that can cripple your enemies or give you the upper hand in battle. Hundreds of items and gear can be mixed and matched to create a unique character all your own. The sheer amount of content in this game is enough to keep you engaged for a good hundred or so hours.

												IntroductionTerraria is a game developed by Re-Logic. The dev team are very active with this game, constantly supporting and adding to the experience, they are really great developers.GameplayTerraria is a sandox 2D adventure game that focuses mainly on exploration, building and combat. It starts in a procedurally generated world where the player is left with basic items to start the adventure and try to succeed in a very hostile and at times, unforgiving world.In Terraria you will encounter many different enemy types from little slimes to huge mechanical bosses that are not easy to take down. The player can use melee, ranged or summoner to take out these beasts and the HUGE range of items and item recipes/combinations makes the game highly replayable.Players house and interact with NPCs in order to progress through the world, with the first NPC being the Guide, whom can be used constantly to reveal all of the item recipes in the game.Lastly, once you have become good at combat, you can try to become good at building, which adds a whole new element to the game, adding even more hours to your game time. You can build structures high up into the air that take up the whole background, or you can just build a simple lil house to go to sometimes in between fighting bosses, it's completely up to you!Pros+ Endless game time+ Awesome weapons/items/enemies+ Constant dev supportCons- No REAL Story (you make your own adventure)- Online Multiplayer is too laggyResult / Final thoughtsFor a game so inexpensive that can produce sooooo many hours of gameplay, it is crazy value for money. You won’t be disappointed by Terraria. It is my second most played game of all time (and I'm a Final Fantasy completionist enthusiast) and definitely one of my top 10 games of all time!-MC "

												Terraria is... probably one of those games about which little more needs to be said, but much like Minecraft, it was definitely what the gaming community wanted, exactly when they wanted it. Unlike Minecraft, which doesn't really shine except for the amazing variety of mods and modpacks created for it, Terraria still stands out among the many games made to follow up on it, with tons of building variety and solid gameplay mechanics.Highly recommended if you want to get into the 2D subgenre of block-building and somehow haven't yet. I wouldn't really write a review for something I feel almost everyone knows well, in general, but I personally nominated this for the “Just 5 More Minutes” Award in the 2016 Steam Awards, because it's a game I've played for just shy of 200 hours, the most of anything I've played on Steam. It's addictive, even for someone like me who much prefers seeing what their friends build to actually building things.			"

												There is only one other game on my list I have played more than Terraria.And that says a lot. Terraria is one of the most fun games I have ever played and I have always felt it was super cheap for the many hours (of addictive fun) I spent playing it.At the basis this is a fantasy RPG-style hack & slay 2D game where you will farm resources and explore the world underground to collect both weapons and items, to craft and upgrade your weapons, gear, and improve your house with essential tools and workbenches, The reason for this is, is because you are essentially always working towards killing the next mini-boss, after having killed the previous. Untill finally the last boss has been reached and defeated.The game has a lot of elements of repetition: you will spend many hours farming resources, and rebattling certain mini-bosses to get as many of a certain resource needed to either upgrade or craft a weapon or armourpiece.All of this is set in a very vibrant and ''cutesy/cartoony'' world, with an interesting back story to why it is you do the things you do (Yes, there actually is some lore). The world is also changeable and will change according to the stages you have reached by killing certain mini-bosses (the difficulty increases once as the game progresses).While you play, according to the actions you take and the available amounts of 'rooms' in your buildings, you will attract all sorts of NPCs, that will help you improve your weapons and gear, sell fun items, or sell items to decorate and build your houses with.There are multiple gamemodes and also multiple modes surrounding your death. You can either opt to lose nothing and have no penalty whatsoever upon death, choose to lose items and money, or go the extreme and have a gameover on death.			"

I enjoy how you can join other people through steam and play with your friends. This feature has made me like the game so much more. I have to confess that I did not start Terraria from scratch.

												Terraria is a really fun game to play with a bunch of friends online or when friends come over. It is a very time consuming game, and there is almost always something to do, whether it's building;exploring;mining or fighting one of the many different and unique bosses.Pros:• Loads of different mobs to fight.• A lot of unique bosses.• Suits every play style.• Random events, and summonable events in general. • Very good game for it's price.Cons:• After playing through it once which will still take a while and still be worth the money, it gets a bit boring, but after a long break it's really fun to replay.• Couldn't really think of any other cons, as it is one of those games that you either enjoy playing or don't.I'd definitely reccomend this to anyone who wants a game that they can play for long periods of time, and still pick it up again the next day, or if you just want a game that some of your friends can come over to play.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)			"

												\\I Highly reccomend this game for people who are interested in buying an Indie, Sandbox Game. As a Gamer with 1000+ Hours on it, I know firsthand There are certain people who would highly enjoy the elements of this game such as Physics Breaking, and Defying Logic. I do suggest getting this game when it goes on sale, but overall, a high-quality game for when you are bored, looking to build awesome 2d-ish builings and sculptures, or wanting to legitamately beat a game, this is definitetly the game for you.From Forests and Oceans, to Going to Hell and Living Mushrooms, there's lots of fun in this 2d-ish, 16 bit pixel hack-and-slash-and-explore game. You might also LEARN something besides proper grammar and spelling, such as different metals and ore values, and how you can edit your house to fit your expectations. This game will be fun for the whole family as the multiplayer option is built in so you can connect with other people around the world! With tons of loot to find, bosses to slay, events to conquer, and weapons to find, craft, or collect, and many different enemies, Such as Zombies and Spiders, and even a Giant Bee!Classes are a thing, but aren't your MMORPG Linear Classes. Certain Aspects of the game are either harder or easier depending on your items. Aspects like Mining depend on your Pickaxe and armor, which can increase mining speed and power. There are many other aspects such as combat, building, and travel. Mounts can make travel faster, and merchants can sell items to affect your placement speed. Accessories can be combined and shown off as vanity.Please excuse my Habits of the Dual Slash ( \\ ) and the spaces in between Quotes, astericks, and Parentheticals. Join in the Fun and games with the Bloodright Bastion, of which is not only used for a Last Stand, but to also game, have fun, ( And Drink maybe ), and hang out!Want a Hotlink? Here ya go! -> https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Bloodright-Ascension "

												What could I say that hasn't been said? Nothing, but I still will. But first, let me tell you why I'm writing this here: It's been more than five years after the release, AND I STILL GOT SOME FREE CONTENT UPDATE! In a time where games don't even get finished this here gem is the role model. Terraria is kinda for everybody. I have a pal, he plays this game and builds awesome stuff with all the different blocks this game has to offer. Of course, it's less impressive than stuff you see online, but he obviously grows. And it's super simple - you decide what you want to build, you pick a color and you place it. I've seen this pal make a nice lake-side cottage the first two hours into the game.For him, it's Architectaria.My girlfriend just loves smashing stuff in video games. She smashes pots, zombies, antlions, small flying eyes, big flying eyes, fish, spiders. She just builds basic boxes for houses and ventures onto her smashing adventure. And she loves all the gibs that fly off from dead monsters.For her, it's Killaria.I, myself sometimes love to grind for loot. I can spend four, five, six hours killing that big fluffy bee go get that flying mount drop for my collection. And I also like stylizing and decorating houses for different NPCs. I just adore building an artificial flying island and placing a wrecked ship there just for one pirate NPC to live there.For me - it's Designaria and Grindaria.Terra means Earth, as in planet Earth. Combining all those ""rarias"" you'd probably get Terraria, as a world of possibilities, for everybody and anybody.Except for those who hate platforming. And pixels.			"

												Buy this game, it's amazing, It's cheap. You know the rule 1 hour = 1 dollar? I know more then a few people who have spent OVER 2k+ hours in this game. But it's literally only 10 dollars. So much variety, there's suspense, there's action, theres luck, there's skill, there's that one moment where you wanna flip your monitor over in excitement because you got that one item. This game isn't a game, it's more or less a  masterpiece	 "

												Terraria is a unique milestone in the evolution of the RPG/sandbox genre. It does contain many of the familiar elements present in such games: digging tunnels, building bases, crafting items, and fighting monsters. However, It ascends above its predecessors by defining a much clearer goal and purpose, emphasizing combat and exploration. Randomized worlds give you plenty of areas to explore, while dungeons and bosses offer unique challenges for you to conquer. Building and mining can give more than just shelter and resources, as you can construct tactical fields or arenas that can cripple your enemies or give you the upper hand in battle. Hundreds of items and gear can be mixed and matched to create a unique character all your own. The sheer amount of content in this game is enough to keep you engaged for a good hundred or so hours.

												""OMG THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE MIENKRAFT IS BETTER IT HAS MOD!!1!11ONE"" claims the Minecraft fanboy, as he stomps his feet onto the hard, mahogany floor. ""Well, Terraria has mods too, atleast they're executed much more perfectly than those Minecraft mods that attempt to implement RPG/Grindfest influenced content."" replies the Terraria fan.Otherwise, as a more serious viewpoint, any time someone uses the ""Minecraft having mods"" argument against Terraria, they would have to take into account that they're claiming that unpolished RPG-esque mods (Advent of Ascension, DivineRPG, ArcanaRPG) are BETTER than a game that has superior altogether polish, even if the Minecraft fanboy/girl(s) take modpacks into account.While they may also have a say about something such as Thaumcraft and Botania, should they realize that both of which aren't even similar to Terraria at all, and only bear a small amount of content and polish as compared to Terraria itself.Carefully awaiting the storm of spite, frustration and rage to engulf me.

												This very probably is one of the giants amongst steam games; Despite seeming to be such a simple, and basic 2D platformer game, it has provided hundreds of hours of fun to myself, along with several of my best friends. The game is really well balanced, continues to receive updates (Even after a year-long scare from the developer who claimed the updates would stop), has a plethora of bosses, loot, craftable items, NPCS, a balanced trading system, thousands of craftable items, blocks, etc... Its a perfect blend of platformer, and sandbox; where you can build just about anything you want, including a rudimentary circuitry system, as well as fight some of the most obscenely hard enemies known to platformer-styled games. All in all, this game is so good, I've even bought it for a few of my friends, and just gave it to them, so that I'd have the opportunity to enjoy the game with them.			"

												One of the most intruiging side scrolling sandbox games I have ever played. Terraria was first released Monday, May 16th, 2011 on Steam and it has come a long way since then. You have the ability to shape your world with materials found high and low. They have even implemented a toggle switch for PvP for those players who want to play with friends or friends of friends with or without a massacre. There are sky islands to explore all the way to the depths of a hellish place filled with demons and a few monstrous creatures. For those of you who like playing with your friends, a multiplayer server is easily set up without the use of any other program besides the game client. I've had tons of fun playing this game and you should do the same.			"

AUDIODecentVISUALCuteDIFFICULTYRangesVIBECreativeCRAVINGExpansivenessON SALEFrequentlyUPDATE: Holy hell, what a patch! This game has shot up from a 7/10 to a 9/10! New baddies, new items, bugs fixed, what a game!PROS: Terraria is excellently-priced for the amount of content and multiplayer fun you'll be getting out of it. Customization in your character and base is extensive and gameplay can be augmented with items that give particular abilities. Characters retain equipment and inventory across servers, so no starting over just because you want a new map. Enemies are highly varied and fascinating to learn about.CONS: You'll be dropped in a world with little direction. It's not quite ""Don't Starve"" levels of self-taught gameplay, but if this feature is more frustrating than rewarding, you will need to open up the Terraria wiki immediately. With such deep caverns, you may find yourself away from the overworld longer than what's comfortable or necessary; choose between the long trek back or a bruteish vertical shaft to jump upwards on for five minutes. Server troubles were present last time I hosted, though this may have changed in the past year. Character system can be easily abused to destroy maps on public servers.WORTH: It's constantly going on sale for very cheap, so consider the 4-pack if you plan to play.OVERALL: It may not be the multiplayer game you dedicate the next two years to, but Terraria is a joy to be shared with others.                                                     SCORE: 9/10 "

There are potions, dyes armors and a CRAP TONE of armors made of random stuff (even bones) some purely asthetic but most provide some perks be it plus health or evtra defence.If you have the chance to get it dont waste that oportunity GET IT.

												This is an anti-feminist game!  There are many signs that PROVE this theory!  On Blood Moons (a seemingly monthly event in the game) the women NPC's get irritable!  Are you saying ALL women get mad on their cycles?!  You are putting us women in a stereotype!  The nurse is female.  She is expected to just heal you whenever, and even other male NPC's have crushes on her!  That's basically R A P E : a horrible thing to have in a game.  One thing I'm glad for in this game is that the trees look like male genitals and us women can chop them down and destroy their power.  Men get everything else.  The tinkerer is male.  Are the developers saying I can't tinker?  Not only this but there are SO many missing options!  There seems to be no ""vegan setting"" in the game.  Why is it so easy to kill animals?  You capture poor animals in a net against their will and you can eat them too! It's not even like you cook the poor animals either, your playable character eats it raw like a feral cavewoman!  Another missing option is the lack of non-binary gender choices.  What if I do not want to sound like a man OR a woman when I get hurt?  And I'm sorry but the women sound like they're explicitly moaning when they get hit.  This means that the developers are masochistic and think that us women like it.  I will not tolerate abuse in this household and I would NEVER let my children play this game, in case it influences them.  Why are females even allowed to be damaged?!  There is no variety of religion in this game.  NO VARIETY.  The only religions are those weird solar reptile things and the lunar cultists.  You can go in the reptile thing's temple and massacre them!  History is repeating itself.  What if I'm a Jew?  I want to fit in somewhere in the game instead of being oppressed.  Take out both the golem and the Moon Lord!  Speaking of the Moon Lord, why is it male?  Why not female?  MEN DON'T CONTROL EVERYTHING!!!			"

												Amazing indie game. More than a minecraft 2D clone. So many items, just too many to count.The atmosphere, graphics and music makes this game amazingly fun. Worth way more than just 9.99$.			"

												If you like minecraft, building, RPG and sanbox games or anything in that genre, You will most likely fall in love with this game. It has a very complicated aspect on it, But it's not that hard to get used to. This game has a lot of fun into it aswell, like minecraft. It's generally fun because you get to build what comes to mind. And get resources for it, In terraria it is similar to that. When i first got this game (2011) I thought it was a 2D minecraft. And it was! Just more complicated and more fun! So, If you like those type of survival sandbox games with an objective (or not) THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!Hope this review helped! :D			"

												I played this game for quite long time non - steam and now I regret it, cuz it'd add a lot more hours in game to my current amount. I bought it so I can also play with friends + achievements.So basically most of ppl say it's a 2D Minecraft... I don't think so. It's WAY more expanded than mc. Tons of items (since 1.3 update there's like 3,5k items in game), 29 bosses (including minibosses), 400+ enemies, different biomes. You can be anyone in this game! A builder, a warrior, an explorer. You can ride an unicorn mount, using a damn yoyo, while fighting against the Moon Lord. There's nothing you can't do! Soundtrack is fantastic! I liked every single track, they're very well made, fitting with environments. You can even record any music track with a music box and then equip it as your accessory, to let you listen to it whenever you want to.This game costs 10 bucks and only 'dlc' that you can buy is official soundtrack. Everytime the game gets updated you can access the new content for free and that's what I love in this game. Because updates are solid, well made and they download in 2-3 minutes top (unless it's a major update like 1.3). Sometimes I wanna make a donation to developers just to show them that I fully support their incredible work. Still waiting for Terraria:Otherworld though. I rate this game 10/10, I got everything and even more of what I'd expect from such a game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.I swear, I didn't write this review just for new badge. I had an idea from some time in my mind. Figured out that now would be a good time for a review for this game. ^^ "

												Terraria is a game of pure fun. With so much to do you will find yourself sitting in front of it for hours. Building,fighting,mining were the core minecraft aspects that made it such a  great game. I am not one of those people calling terraria 2d minecraft because it is so much more. The content of minecrafts 20 dollars can never compare to those of this 2d 10 dollar masterpiece. The fun will never end here.As a closing statement the only thing i ask is,Relogic,Please dont abandon this game with its community the way it is. Please dont make a new game or a dlc trying to hog money out of us,Because i know you are better then that,I know whoever can make a game like this can stop the terrariany of the impending doom of Money sucking situations.Terraria forever,not terraria other world,not terraria 2,not terraria second generation,TERRARIA. the original and forever fun game.FOREVER FREE!
