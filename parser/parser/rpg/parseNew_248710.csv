												I am writting this review because I see it on sale. This is a negative review. This game is bad. I really did try to like it. It just feels broken. The controls feel broken, the skills are unbalanced. I only played a few hours. I just did not want to try anymore. It just wasnt worth it to me. Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, just so many more out there that are really good. This feels like a lazy port. It fooled me because the video and store page made it look so good. Im giving this review to help my steam friends stay away from it. Also it helps me to really study before I get another unknow game.			"

												I bought this game after reading the reviews and thinking, ""How bad can they really screw up an ARPG game?"" I mean, its just point and click to move around and attack things. Not much more depth to these games than that.Needless to say, I was shown exactly how you can screw it up by playing this game for 30 minutes. 1. Bad controls2. Bad graphics3. No video options4. Horrible voice acting5. interface looks like its from 19936. Animations are pretty bad7. Combat is horribly slow, like its running at half the speed it should be.If this game is the project of a couple of college students trying to pass game design 101, then congrats. This game just screams amature. It feels very unpolished, and I couldnt bring myself to play it another minute, despite only having played it for 30.			"

												I first began to suspect something was fishy with this game when I noticed the tablet version has an infinitely smoother UI. That sums this game up well. Crappy port of a game built for a platform not ideal for gaming.This game is poorly designed and has some horrible game breaking bugs. Im a reasonable person, and I know its an indie game so I can cut the devs some slack. I can do that much. But unfortunately what I cant do is play a game where when I click on an enemy, my spell fires way the ♥♥♥♥ in another direction. Additionally, the witches minions always lag 3-4 steps behind you, so basically you have to run into a crowd of mobs and aggro them then run back to get the minions to attack. This coupled with my characters ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aim means that when my spiders finally do attack, they take damage too fast since most my attacks miss completely and the enemies dont die fast enough. If they devs arent going to take the time to correct something so critical as a spells aim, then Im not going to take the time to play it.			"

												The game is definately a low-end Diablo-style game.  But then, for a $15 price-point, I would NOT expect a high end game (with a notable exception of Van Helsing!).  As other reviewers stated, there are lots of minor bugs and the voice acting is so flat that it is terrible.  When it works, the game can be fun and there does appear to be a good story in the background.  The main problem was that there were times when a dialog box was supposed to appear and you are supposed to be shown some text from the story but when that dialog box didnot appear, the game was stuck.  You couldn't do anything except CRTL-ALT-DEL to quit the game. That bug has since been fixed in a recent update.User interface:  6/10Gameplay:  7/10 Graphics:  6/10 (too dark for my tastes)Sound:  5/10 (music is repetitive)Story:  7/10Voice acting:  3/10Stability: 9/10 (the game never crashed, but it did lock up numerous times before a recent fix; havent played since)English:  6/10 (numerous small English mistakes.  Some actully seem to add atmosphere, though; e.g., Conan the Barbarian)			"

												Okay, first of all, I get it; This is a low budget, independent attempt to create an Action RPG exclusive for mobile devices and they've ported it to PC Platforms to widen their audience. Major kudos for people who put effort in this game, I really mean it. But, you see, when you develop a game or even any software on mobile devices, there's not much of an expectation because of the nature of mobile devices; Yet, when you port a particular piece of software that is designed to run on mobile devices, to PC Platforms, you raise the expectation bar pretty high. That's purely because a PC is much more stronger and a lot more customizable.Now, why did I buy this game? Because I had a couple of bucks to spare and it was available on Linux - which is pretty much the biggest selling point for me, as we don't have many Action RPG titles. And, sadly, we still don't have that many good titles as they have on Windows.I've read many comments and reviews about this game before buying it and I've realized that the game was in worse condition than this, as this is a PC Port. I can clearly see that they've made quite the UI Improvements, comparing to the Mobile Version of this game; Which is a good way to go but they should've made this happen at the time they were porting the game to PC. This is the main cause of the early negative user reviews and they are right, unfortunately, still the game's User Interface is pretty much useless and is still suffering from touch screen features.So, there are porting problems but what about the actual game? - If you're a Hardcore ARPG Player, you will be disappointed. The game is painfully easy and has many design flaws; Not to mention bad controls. Playing this game with a mouse as a Witch, for me, was quite painful. That's why I don't use mouse, I use my keyboard to control my character and use my abilities; and again, since it's designed for mobile devices, you have the Option to turn on or off auto-targetting. - Which is ironically the best feature this game has because it's poorly designed for a Ranged Character.Graphics aren't that bad. Not a challange, compared to other titles like Path of Exile, Grim Dawn or Diablo III. But it's okay; Not many ARPG fans do actually care about the graphics, rather than optimization of the game to allow players play the game at a higher level of smoothness and frame rates. - So far, I haven't encountered such a problem. Kudos for that.I loved the Soundtrack. OST is probably the best thing about this game and it's pretty good, you may or may not agree with me. - It gets a bit too repetitive, though. Voiceacting will seem decent to a point. But, yeah, you'll get annoyed by it anyway. And, again, it's a low-budget game, I wouldn't use this as an argument. I understand.Controls are.. well, not optimal. - As long as you bind your skills to the letters around your ""S"" key, which is the default Auto-Attack bind for the game, you're good to go. You really don't need to play this game with a mouse. Playing the game with numbers 6-9 is pointless, at least for me. - One other thing that will majorly bug people who'll choose to play this game as a Witch, when your enemy is near you; Your character will start Melee your enemy if you're using your Default Attack. Needless to say, it's weak and will most likely get you killed.There's absolutely nothing interesting about Characterization and Building up your character. It's pretty generic and quite dull. - Story, so far, is too cliche. Storytelling is weak. Dialogs are badly written and you really won't care about the Lore, when your screen is filled with Character Dialogs, talking about nonsense. - It could be developed better. But, yeah, I don't think this is their selling point anyway, since it's a freaking Action RPG for Mobile Devices.I really don't want to be harsh. But, again, when you port your game to PC, you'll raise the expectations and when those expectations could not be feed with proper features, your game will get downvoted for many many reasons.But, let me be honest, I've had good time with this game. and the ability to play an Action RPG on Linux is always a good thing for me. Yet, this game looks undone. That's why I will not Recommend this game. - Until the development provide the proper fixes to the gameplay, this isn't a game that worths its initial price. But from a discount, yeah, maybe. If you have time to spare or don't expect that much, you might entertain yourself for hours, just to beat the game and get some achievements.Iesabel might be a wasted potential. I'll never know. But I hope they learn from their mistakes and develop better games for PC. - Again, thanks for porting your game to Linux. It means a lot.			"

												This writing comes off of me playing through Diablo 3 and Reaper of Souls so ultimately (and perhaps unfairly) the comparison will be made.You start off with basically no story except you have to find some witch doctor as he has your memory. For some reason you come equiped with a spike club, torn pants and a shield. Lesabel has all the things you expect in these type of games. There's a character sheet with all your basic stats (Str, Dex, Int Lck etc). There's a quest log to keep track of your progress. Inventory and Map to tell where you are going (or have to go)Controls are typical point and click to attack and a skill bar but still feel clunky.AI .. at least the first few encounters.. are painful. They basically look at you all the while your mouseclicks at times become unresponsive and occasionally hit. You can be clicking to your hearts content and nothing will happen until you move your character forward an inch or backward. This serves as a major problem as I almost died while being surrounded by 3-4 baddies within 5 mins of gameplay. You can scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. I prefer to play scrolled in as you can see the baddies a bit better and target more accurately.When your character is moving it feels like he's floating as there is little animation. Pathfinding does not flow well. You cannot click down the path for your toon to go there, you have to click (and hold) close to the toon to navigate him around the right map corners.I know this might be me being picky but not only are the colours all a dull shade but the text is very boring.My favorite part by far is the sound when you level up. You are greeted with a voice that sounds an awful lot like Doctor Claw from Inspector Gadget. ""I'm getting Skilled!"" I ended my adventure with this game upon reaching the witch doctor, not without dying a bunch on the way at a measly level 4. The text was hard to read as it blended in with the background but the jist of it is, my character is a horrible guy that killed a bunch of people and has no memory. - That's when I decided to uninstall the game. However I couldn't find an exit menu so I had to Alt+F4 it.Verdict - Do Not Recommend. Instead play Diablo, Torchlight, Titan's QUest or Dungeon Siege.EDIT: I now know why I couldn't hit the baddies as much as I would of liked. This isn't point and click. Its Point and Click and HOLD.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I am going to say that again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Not at full price. Not at half price. Not for a quarter of the price. DO NOT EVEN BUY THIS GAME FOR 90% OFF. Since this game was on sale for $1.49 at 90% off, I figured why the hell not buy it for myself and a couple of friends. It's $1.49! It has multiplayer! Surely this would scratch our itch for a dungeon crawler. Sadly, it didn't. I can't say whether the game is bad or not. I refuse to play it. What I can tell you is that if you intend on purchasing this for the multiplayer, DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE. I only paid $1.49 for this game, $4.47 if you the two gift copies I purchased. I absolutely regret it. The multiplayer in this game DOES NOT WORK. Not online, not with LAN. Seriously. It doesn't work at all, and if you read around the forums it doesn't look like it ever has. Don't make the mistake I did and assume that this game is worth a dollar. It isn't. The worst part is that even though the store page is a blatant lie and laden with misinformation, I'm not likely to get a refund.			"

												I started my first character and got to level 2 (which means 2 minutes of gameplay) only to be already hugely disappointed having encountered seriously frustrating bugs, appaling UI and gamemechanics for the Hack'n'Slash genre and catastrophic pathfinding and battle mecanisms. At that point I already wanted to give up.I forced myself to level up to 10, and tried the same with the other class. The Soundtrack was getting on my nerves as it seemed a pale attempt to imitate Tristram Theme (Diablo) mixed with some Metal influences and the intent to sound kind of oriental. This impression got reinforced once I played the Barbarian Class and heard his voice. When you overdo something, well it doesn't sound genuine at all at the end.Around level 6, noticing there was an extremely fast repop of all the mobs on the map and thinking that was kinda cool... I met ""The Shaman"". Well horrible story telling and shallow scenaristic choices there. Then, I found out my XP bar after going up insanely fast at start, did not go up at all. And that is one very very very bad design choice to go from ""I get so much XP in no time"" to ""I can kill a million monsters and there will be no progress"" in regards of the game economy.So let's talk about that, game economy. Setting up my skills after leveling up, I find that I have to choose between some battle skills, some stats enhancing skills and the alchemy - the crafting ""novelty"" for the genre. Well, to craft a potion (beside the fact there is only a chance to achieve that depending on the level of the skill) I need to buy vials, and have a few ingredients found all over the map. So far so good, right? Well no. Buying a potion directly from the shopkeeper do cost slightly more than a vial, well actuallly nearly as much... so why even care about the alchemy then since it present so little benefits on top of taking skills points you could assign somewhere else? - Well kind of somewhere else since it is not like there is much customization options or cool skills or even synergies which require ambiguous choices from you. Falling flat once again.Additionnaly, the respawn of all mobs, the poor and dumb loot (opposed to ""smart loot concept"" - as I was getting more stuff for ""the other class"" than for the one I played, and to mention that I found no stash or even less shared stash so basically every epic/legendary you drop that is not for your class is only trash loot - or worth a bit more money than actual trash loot), the stamina system and the XP lock (or extremely steep reduction of XP gain) makes it senseless to stay in an area to farm it (to upgrade your character) as the cost of fighting the mobs may be higher than the benefits of doing so, and even if you took self-regen health skill the action of farming remain pretty boring since the only benefit you get from it is (poor and rare) loot. Then the Stamina, you can hardly cross the village without getting exhausted... seriously? No one in the design team thought about turning that off in the village? baahhhhh...I really really kept trying to play, despite the below par graphics, the horrible pathfinding of my spider (Witch), the inability to blow a destructible object while I am standing 2 pixels away because the attack just does not want to trigger just like it also happens when NPC's accompany you and for some reason prevent you from attacking the mobs (Barb) and the voice acting and dialogs which at some point I would have like to switch off (""this area stinks like hell!"") but instead had the option in the setting to set my zoom level (which works with the mouse wheel as well). I really tried to enjoy this ga... *sigh* ...thing.But it feel like everything in it is an attempt to populate the UI and to imitate what has been done before in the category in terms of gameplay, without having actually thought about the gameplay as everything is highly unbalanced and utterly lacking depth or innovative thoughts (also I do understand that with such rigid game mecanics, it may have seemed hard to do more).Well, I did not pay so much for the game myself - though in terms of time spent on it it has costed me much more than Diablo series, Torchlight series or Van Helsing series combined. If you enjoyed any of the latter, you may not enjoy Iesabel at all as it fall short in all aspects it tries to clone and also fail to add value with the crafting system. I uninstalled and will never discover what pleasures and scenario twists awaits me in the mid and end game and well, I can't recommend this to any gamer who respect himself as such.			"

												I've tried to like this game but it simply has flaws. tons of them.What exactly is lesabel?An action-rpg like diablo or torchlight.What are the major flaws?Starting with the lack of mouse-over-information on many icons, over a missing stats screen (I can't even see the benefits of skilling dexterity since there aren't any stats like dmg/s, accuracy, block%, etc.), horrible voice acting (barbarian sound like a thirteen old trying to make his voice darker), flaws in questdesign (many quests aren't even listed - f.e. witch in swamps who needs ingredients - ingredients weren't listed there. gave her something random. she was ♥♥♥♥♥ing around. quest failed. wtf?), tons of clipping issues (prepare to get stuck (had to restart) between fences or to bump in everything), a pretty lame combat system with no autoattack and a confusing healthbar where you can't tell if you have 100% or 80% health and there are only 2 classes - barbarian and witch.What are the minor flaws?The menues overall seem to be unfinished - icons look pretty bad. There are only few color indicators for equipment, like a missing red color for gear you can't equip. The german translation is googletranslate + hasn't been translated at all - very bad job, really - if you can't get this done well stick to english but don't give us a sh*tty translation.Well, and the graphics itself are ok, nothing more. Flora looks nice, enemies and main character have good animations. Some NPCs look like ps1-era, nevertheless.What did I like?The music and style overall. It's like a dark diablo with ambient music. Even though I haven't tried alchemy and other crafting skills due the lack of information overall there are many different ingredients like berries and enemy drops to collect for potions, scrolls and other things.Overall:I can't recommend this game after playing it for almost 2 hours. The flaws were killing my motivation within the played time to bottom zero.Disclaimer: I've played diablo 2 for more than 1.000 hours. Titan Quest almost 200 hours. Torchlight 1 100% achievements. I know and like the genre but this game - sorry, no.			"

												+ Could be recommened if on sale, as it's fair way to pass the time if you're bored... or you've exhausted all the GOOD top-down ARPG options (Diablo III, Dungeon Siege III, Torchlight etc.)+ Great music that creates a unique ambience.+ Some nifty, unexpected physics effects that add a bit more visual flair.+ The GUI (HUD, menus etc.) has some nice moments for a budget/indie game, with a pleasant aesthetic (jagged & illegible text aside).- This game is a mobile port, and it clearly shows in the lack of polish and exciting content. I could imagine playing this on the bus on the way to work... but as a fully-fledged PC gaming experience, it falls significantly short of the competition.- $15 USD may be asking too much, when there are similar experiences of higher overall quality for a lower price out there.- The basic combat is unresponsive, which too often results in awkward, unenjoyable experiences. Combat being the bread & butter of the game, this quickly becomes tiresome.- Character designs are often poor, or just bland, and the quality of their models match this.- The animation is APPAULINGLY amatuer. This makes the game incredibly dull, rendering the world's inhabitants devoid of any personality or energy.- The sound assets are a joke, and have that overall ""canned"" feeling: terrible voice acting and sloppy effects.- On the UX (experience) side of the UI, there's a lot of work that could be done. Navigating the game's interface often feels unintuitive. - Very few in-game graphics options, with the absence of features like AA being particularly noticeable.			"

												|ENG \ RUS|Rules tell me to be polite while writing a review for this game, and I'll try. It's very hard to do. This game is what you call PURE EVIL. When you love action RPGs like Titan Quest or Diablo, you go and make something like Path of Exile or Grim Dawn. But when you see those games getting support and want some too while doing especially nothing, you make Iesabel. This game is not just bad. It's one of the worst I played, and from my profile you can see I play a lot. I also had PS1 back there and PS4 now, plus Wii U and 3DS. I never seen such a catastrophy of a game. The worst thing in Iesabel is the controls - and I can't explain it, it just feels broken. Your character moves whenever he or she wants, and you cant realize, what's blocking your path, because ground texture is like... I dont want to use the s-word here, but this is perfect analogy. Graphics is unappealing to say the least. Character  progression is broken too - skills are not only stupid, but unbalanced. Just do yourself a favour and dont support this kind of lazy ""indie"" developers. They should be punished, not supported.***Эта игра просто отвратительна, я давно не встречал ничего подобного. Когда кто-то пытается лениво склонировать Диабло и постричь денег на популярном некогда и переживающем второе рождение благодаря играм вроде Grim Dawn и Path of Exile жанре, получается нечто плохое. Но Иезабель - это не просто нечто плохое, это НАТУРАЛЬНОЕ ЗЛО.Играть в эту игру просто нереально. Управление уничтожает любые попытки получить хоть какое-то удовольствие. Ваш персонаж движется как марионетка на веревочке, а уж какп рименять скиллы... Это даже не буду комментировать - это надо самому прочувствовать, НО НЕ СТОИТ. Более того, скиллы ужасны и несбалансированы, а количество персонажей то ли пока, то ли до определенного момента в игре равно ДВУМ, что не дает даже надежды на разнообразие. И, повторюсь, подбор навыков у этих двух классов уныл.Словом, ни в коем случае не поддерживайте этих лентяев.			"

												This game is a bit rough, that much is true.  But I'm having a lot of fun with Iesabel, and that's all I'm asking from a game.  This is a fun dungeon crawler in the vein of Diablo III or Titan Quest.  Indeed, it has a rough translation and some fairly awkward menus to grind through, especially when managing resolutions.  Plus only two characters for use is kinda a step back, even compared to Diablo 1.But I'm giving this game some leeway, due to the fact it started out as an iPad/iPhone mobile game.  On those devices, this game is a freaking dynamo; it's easily one of the most deep 'hardcore' games on mobile devices.  When ported to the PC, it faces much more competition, especially as deeper and higher budget.  But I think that this game holds up well.Whether you can forgive this game's roots and see it for what it is - that's for you to decide.  For the price (I paid twelve bucks for it) I say go for it.  It's surprisingly in-depth and really feels at home on a PC.  Totally worth the price.  Thumbs up.			"

 Long Story Short Iesabel is a good game that is lacking in several features. The art is mediocre and the music is the same. The game, surprisingly, has a very good story with lots of plot twists. The achievements are broken and up-grading system is disheartening. And yet, somehow, I still played it 32 hours. Sadly, there are only two classes to pick from and the mage is the only one that is half descent. Which really sucks for those of us who like to play as melee class. I honestly believe that Iesabel has a solid foundation of fun game play yet it lacks far too much polish for it to be a great game. 6/10 Long Story Long- The Game PlayLike most games of its kind, there will be a lot of running around, dodging attacks, grinding, and lots of regretful up-grade points spent in stupid areas.  Surprisingly enough, the developer added in crafting system in order to make potions, teleporters, and enchantments. This adds in another dimension to the game as you search for plants, scraps, etc. along your way in order to create all sorts of useful items.  There are multiple quest and side quest to complete in the game all of which offer XP and gold. These quests enhance the experience and provide extra play time despite how unreasonable the NPC’s requests are.The Loot System and Upgrades The loot system for Iesabel has received a lot of complaints. But I find that it’s one of the redeeming qualities.  Instead of the normal armor system where you just trade armor your lower value loot for clearly better equipment, Iesabel forces the player to pick careful. You will have to choice whether you want a helmet with higher armor but doesn’t have the +30% spirit that the other did, or if it’s worth it to lower your dexterity for the sake of your defense, and so on and so forth. When it comes to upgrades, the game has six options: strengths, defense, dexterity, spirit, intelligence, and luck. Unfortunately, the player has to guess as to what any of them mean. For some odd reason the creator decided to leave you clueless as to what they are by not making no explanation for what any of them mean. On top of that, the up-grades become useless towards the end of the game. Who cares if you invest all your points into strength if it’s only going to increase your attack by 1%? It’s really a shame and extremely annoying.Music, Sound, and Voice Acting I was pleasantly surprised by the music upon playing. It fits all the themes perfectly and really added to the experience. However, the sound affects where a bit of a letdown. They were very generic, repetitive, and really get on your nerves when there are so many dang bats making your ears blead with their terrible shrieks. And then there is the voice acting. I finished the game on easy without volume on. By the time a replayed on medium I had a pretty good idea of who the character was: a witty, sarcastic, educated, self-centered dame that really, really wanted to find out her origins. Then I played with the voice acting on. I’m not over doing it when I say that she sounded exactly like a fat cave women. I can honestly say that having that voice acting on for five minutes was the single most frustrating part of my month. Thank the Lord, yes I literally thanked him, that there is an option to turn off the freaking thing. If you buy this game make sure to disable it as soon as you enter the game. Just press esc and toggle it off.Art and Achievements The artwork is neither here nor there. The sprites themselves are very well done but you often are able to see out of the room or you notice that the shading is dramatically off. As for the achievements, they were, in essence, disappointing. The majority of them are bugged and sometimes weren’t given to you after completing the requirements while at other times were randomly given to you for doing nothing. Furthermore, two of them are broken, there are quite a few multiplayer achievements that can’t be done, several of them require playing 100+ hours, and a few of them make you play the game completely over 15 times. Don’t get me wrong, the achievements do worlds more good than bad. In fact, I sacrificed 20 hours just to get a few of them. I can confidently say that I wouldn’t have played this game if it wasn’t for those bugged, broken, unfair achievements. Conclusion Yes the game has many, many flaws. Yes there are hundreds of better games of its kind. Yet, Iesabel has good game play, a great story, decent music, and is very fun to play in one to two hour increments. I had a few friends actually ask me whether I would suggest this game or not. After I had thought about it for a while, I said “yes, I think I do suggest it. But” I warned “make sure to get it on a mega sale, don’t expect much, and be darn sure to turn off that flipping voice acting!” Gameplay- 7/10. Music- 8/10. Sounds- 3.5/10. Voice acting- 0/10. Art- 6/10. Achievements- 7/10. Story- 9.5/10. Final rating- 62/100			"

												I'm generally VERY accomodating to most games. This game compelled someone who does not write reviews for Steam to write one, and unfortunately not for a positive reason. Pros: -Interesting conceptCons:-UI and overall presentation are awful to the point of near unplayability-Bug ridden-Poor introduction-Broken game mechanicsActually I could list 20 or more reasons to avoid this game. Please, don't waste your time on this.			"

												When I review a game, I try to play it at least for an hour, but not happening on this one, in the first 15 mins I was out of potions and died twice.This is an IOS game that's been ported to PC, so if you want to play a Diablo Clone, in every sense of the word right down to the way they do their cross O's.  It feels so much like Diablo 2, I can't even begin to describe the similarities, it might as well be Diablo 2.If you need a style of game like this, for your tablet, then I suppose, buy it, but as far as PC gaming, Torchlight II, or Path of Exile, and I personally didn't even like Path of Exile, but I'm going to tell you, that game, is better then this one, in game play, resolution, story, depth of characters, every sense of the word.Iesabel gives you the choice of one of two characters, Barbarian or Witch.  Really Witch should just be Necromancer and be done with it, but yeah it's a Witch.  Barbarian is Male, Witch is Female, there is no choice to switch or swap.  There is no character customization of any kind, I imagine finding loot changes your appearance, but I didn't get far enough in the game to find any loot.Basically it's an IOS Game, if you're buying games on your PC, there are many games that do it bigger or better, get one of them.  If you are hard up for a Diablo Clone in every sense of the word on your tablet, and you want a challenge, at least in the start zone, then give it a go, if you're that hard up for a new game. :D:2/5 stars			"

												Since I got this game for free in one of the giveaways, the least I could do would be to write an honest review.I have played the game for 1 hour odd take or give a few minutes.You start the game off with only 1 of 2 available classes, a melee one and a ranged magical one, both of which come with their own problems down the line.After you select your generic charachter you are put into a plush world which for some reason really messes with your head, I'm not sure if its because of the blur effect or is it because of the lighting in this game...Queue in a very repeditive sound track and ta da you have Iesabel.So lets now break down the essential components of the game.Story: Cant say too much about this, but from the hour that I played, I could see where it was heading. There is a lot of banter with NPC's which make you feel very sheepish while reading through their monologues and you dont really want this type of feeling in a RPG cause lets face it, you would end up skipping it once you have had enough of it.Design and Graphics: The graphics are fairly descent, but like I mentioned above there is just something about the blurry effect that does not bode well with me. After this hour spent in the game, I could feel the strain on my eyes, which is definatly a first. The design is fairy APRG'ish and does not do anything beyond of what this genre already does. Imaginary walls were galore here as well as weird dead ends.Playstyles: Not a lot of variety here, considering its a story of 4 people you get to only play one class... The skills get very pepedative after a while.Combat: Very very very clunky, you guys really need to rework this, espically for the magic class, I found it really hard at times to land ranged attacks. Sometimes the skills would just miss and other times my char decided that facing away from the approaching danger and firing her weapon was a better idea....Grind Level: For the one hour I put in, I reached level 7 since the mobs keep spawning in regular cycles. I did this with zero stat increases as well as basic armor drops. With regards to the story, I did not even complete one quest....Loot: The loot system like combat needs to be reworked. Since there are just 2 types of classes, is it really essential for my magic caster to get warrior type drops throught the damn game. My first Legendary was for the other ******* class. This was just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.There were two other attractions crafting which I didnt come around to doing and multiplayer which was having some problems at the time of writing this review.(The devs were good enough to mention this before you purchased the game)TL;DR: In its current state Iesabel is not worth it. The devs have something in their hand though and with imporvements here and there, it could transform into a descent laidback ARPG. "

												I tried to like this game. I tried really, really hard, but I just couldn't.the skills are horribly thought out, or simply not thought out whatsoever. some skills are so weak compared to others that they lose all value, and crafting skills come at the expense of combat skills. levelling skills beyond their bare minimum also seems to lower the value of those skills, given that the mana cost for the skill increase is much lower than the benefit of levelling the skill. overall, the entire skill system seems as though it was simply thrown in at the last minute, or that it was half completed when the game was considered complete, and so they added a bunch of filler to make it at least seem like there is a worthwhile skill system in it.gameplay is also horribly broken. if you're playing as the ranged class, it isn't as broken, but it is still broken. horribly broken. the game feels both unresponsive, and poorly designed in the gameplay aspect, especially targetting, in which the player always seems to target the 'closest' mob, regardless of which mob you are clicking on, unless 'manual targetting' or whatever is enabled. manual targetting doesn't completely fix the problem, but it does alleviate it a tiny bit, so that it is (very) slightly more playable.the item system is also terrible. it, like the skills system, seems as though it was simply thrown in at the last minute, or half completed and thrown in anyway, with some filler included. at least this, however, comes with some explanation, if you find the pane which describe the benefits of the stats. this, much like everything else in the game comes with almost no hint of where to find it, or its' usefulness.the levels are mediocre, with very basic enemies, and the poor player responsiveness, as well as the terrible targetting system makes the game so trying, that you end up resenting the time you spent trying to like the game.

												The game is garbage.  I spend on average 4-5 seconds, per monster, attempting to hit them.  The ranged Witch will randomly fire off orbs in directions that she isn't facing.  Solution?  Spend talent points on a pet spider...that does absolutely nothing to assist you in combat.  The one thing you would think would be designed to assist a class with zero defense is itself, also useless.Nevermind that the game is slow and the controls are clunky.  I only paid 3 bucks for it, but my 3 dollars could have been better spent on some White Castle burgers.			"

												It is hard to get used to the interface. The tab icons (character, skills etc) show no info while hovering over, so you have to try until you find the right tab. Items can disappear, e.g when you try to equip a staff when you wield a totem and a shield. The character reacts inaccuratly to mouse clicks. If you use the auto targeting mode you have a hard time targeting the enemy you want. If you don't use it, you habe a hard time hitting at all. Projectiles are fired in the direction the character is looking after a short delay instead of the direction the mouse pointer. That means either you stand still until you have fired or the projectile will fly in a random direction. But even if you wait, it can go wrong, when the mouse pointer is above some unpassable terrain, which is hard to distinguish.All these things slow gameplay down, which isn't fun.The graphics are not good, but OK.In my opinion the game is in a pre-beta state and needs a lot of fixes. It has the potential to become good and fun, but that is a long way. Until then, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I have always been very fascinated by RPG's made in the style of Dungeons and Dragons which I got around to play a bit in the good old days. So when I saw a giveaway of this game I decided to give it a try despite all the bad reviews I have read. I am usually one that prefers to try something for myself before judging a game so I gave it a launch. And boy was I disappointed. The opening scene really didn't explain much although the artwork was very nice I give that to the developer. But the graphics looked way too 2000esque. Don't get me wrong that can be a good thing in certain games but in this one they looked horrible. The Menus and the font in it are clunky and the interface very hard to understand. You only had two classes to choose from the Witch and the Barbarian who play exactly the same way and are very generic in design. The enemies are also very generic. Plus they have promised a fix to the Multiplayer who doesn't even work back in 2014. It is 2016 and clearly no fix has come probably because the developers abandoned the game. Even if you are one of those persons who buys cheap games on sale just for cards? Well think again since this game has none of that. I can't recommend this even on free so avoid it like the plague. If you want a game in this genre I recommend Path of Exile or Neverwinter who are free titles. This one avoid it.			"

												Honestly, I bought this game because it was on sale and I was curious to see if it was as bad as everyone said.   It's not.  The graphics are pretty good and the soundtrack is excellent. The alchemy/crafting system, like the skill tree and gameplay in general, is uncomplicated.  There are annoyances aplenty with the targeting and pathfinding, but they're hardly dealbreakers.  Iesabel is by no means a  GREAT game - this isn't in the same league as Grim Dawn or anything like that - but its simplicity can be a virtue.  Sometimes it's fun to just go kill stuff without constantly checking your gear and worrying about a dozen different resistances.  If that's the mood you're in- and it's on sale- then this is the game for you.			"

												Iesebel is a Diablo-style top-down RPG. It's not good at that. The UI - which is absolutely essential in games like this - is a blurry mess with no explanations whatsoever. There is noticeable lag for every UI action and the UI text is barely readable. The game's graphics are okay-ish, but the game runs way too slowly for that level of quality. The story is not engaging at all and feels cliché.Verdict: Skip this and play Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile instead.			"

												Although the game is buggy I admit it was fun for a while. The targeting system is beyond terrible. The fun part was trying to find build that will negate this for my witch. Summons plus tornado worked for most of the game. I encountered few other issues like spirit drain and generation issues. I decided to give up with the game just before the end of the game when it crashed, savegame got corrupted somehow and my character was loaded at first location in the game with no way to get back to previous point except running through all locations again.To sum it up. Graphically it the best word to describe it is OK. Music is actually really nice and fitting. Gameplay is based on finding the best approach to play along with bugs and glitches... which was something new to me. So yes, the game is exactly the thing I would call ""so bad it is good"".

												Blowing up monsters, beating numerous side quests, leveling up like crazy, having really awkward conversations with a shaman dude, Iesabel has it all. If only it weren’t a mobile game.Now, I have nothing against mobile games, or mobile ports, but Iesabel suffers from the common downfalls of an Android and iOS port. While the graphics of the game aren’t terrible, and manage to actually retain their quality throughout the game (which is better than about 75% of games these days), I found myself constantly stuck on walls and bugging through trees. The UI seemed a little too rushed in my opinion, and while it didn’t really clutter my screen, it just didn’t look nice. What really hurt was the targeting system. Just clicking on an enemy doesn’t always mean your character will attack it, and using abilities require you to be facing in the right direction. It wasn’t unplayable by any means, but it wasn’t fun either.Okay okay, enough trash talk, lets get to the redeeming qualities.The game’s got a story. It’s not particularly well written, but the plot is pretty good. There are twists and turns and characters that I actually like. There’s plenty of dialogue and a semblance of world creation. It’s not Diablo III, but I promised myself I wouldn’t compare this game to it. There are plenty of side quests to do. Unlike other games I won’t mention, side quests are actually needed to go through the game. While this can be annoying at times, I personally enjoyed doing them, as I felt like I was actually a part of the world.Graphics: 6Gameplay: 2Story: 7This game had so much potential to be great, and I’m sorry I didn’t enjoy it more, but I must be honest here. The game isn’t worth your time. A finicky and boring battle system and bugs galore make it a thumbs down for me.Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												First and main reason why you shouldn't buy this game, the developers might be dead, as they haven't  responded since year 2013 if I'm not mistaken.  Well then, back to normal review.Pros: If you are tiered of living and you are achievement hunter, get this game, as it is a cancer for achievement hunters.Cons:- no actual multiplayer - same two musical all through game, and they are 30 sec long each- achievements are bugged, and you can't get them(unless you do something bad ;))- to ""completely "" finish the game, you need to pass it on easy>medium>hard, only things changing is mobs hp/dmg and not even so noticeable. You still can get lvl 6 drops when you start medium with your lvl 55 character, at rate of 80/20- skills are unbalanced really badly, it's enough with one skill to face roll the whole game on all difficulties.- quest story is pure bs, and makes no sense. Did best I could to read through it all. I'll say it like this, CS:GO has a lot better story then this game- controls. Well you don't need them too much, you just need to move and click one skill, but would be nice if you wouldn't brake fingers while doing it.- bugs, bugs, bugs. Want to see how a wolf combination with wall looks like, I could make a screen shot, just ask. Like running into invisable walls, it is really fun, there are 10 walls on each level, that you can't see. Barrels that can sustain more dmg then all the bosses combined, plenty of them. And I'm just getting started.-only two classes to play with, well, haven't tried Mage one, but maybe he uses 2 skills not just one, like barbarian dos o.oConclusion:= there is nothing good in this game.= steam should call ambulance to the apartment of the developers, I think they died= this game appeared in my library, I am devoted achievement hunter, there are achievements I can't get, who ever sent it to me, I'm waiting for a compensation >_>= please someone, tell me how to remove game from your library Q.Q			"

Posted: May 18, 2014
												I have mixed feelings about Iesabel.  It is pretty much a game in beta state right now.  I just finished a complete playthrough on Linux and the entire experience was pretty ""meh"".  I am a big fan of the ARPG genre and the pickings are slim in Linux at the moment so I picked up the game last year sometime when it was on sale for a little under $4.00.  At that price point, I would recommend the game to anyone who likes the genre.Probably the most positive thing I can say about the game is that the graphics engine is actually pretty good.  I'd give it a 7.5/10 and rank it just a notch below Path of Exile when comparing it to recent ARPG titles.  The art style is sort of in between D3 and PoE, with a more gritty, realistic direction than what D3 had.  Environmental animations are done well.  Character and NPC animations not as well, but adequate.The music/ambient sound is not bad, and is varied enough throughout the game that you probably won't end up having to mute it--UNLESS--you're playing the barbarian with the horrible voice.  Seriously, it's like Bale's Batman voice was trying out for a death metal band's lead vocalist opening.The controls are so-so.  You can tell the game was ported from a touch title.  Sometimes you think you're clicking on something (and most likely are) but the game doesn't want to acknowledge the action.  Fortunately for combat you can assign a key to your standard attack so it didn't hamper this aspect of the game much.  It was most noticable when trying to pick up loot and you had to click around 10 times before it would finally pick up.  This didn't happen often enough for it to become a throw-the-monitor-out-the-window type of nuisance.The stat engine, very important in any ARPG, is pretty generic and simplistic.  Unfortunately, the loot is very generic with no named items or outstanding qualities to be found throughout the game.  You get unique, epic and legendary items that just have those classifications tacked on before the item name and some pretty generic stat modifiers depending on which classification it is.The difficulty level (on default/easy) has some weird swings early on but the game does become quite easy toward the end if you've spent your skill points wisely.  The skill system itself wasn't horrible as a barbarian, just a little simpler than say D2.Probably the biggest flaw in the game is the English translation.  It's awful.  I can only imagine they hired Kanye West to do it.Finally, there are a lot of bugs.  Nothing that kept me from finishing the game, however the final boss fight did partially freeze up on me the first time I attempted it and I had to kill the game process.  The second time through worked out ok.   In the third act there are graphics placeholders for conversations with some of the NPCs; there are quests in every act that don't work correctly; there are achievements that are unattainable with the game in it's current state.  Apparantly multiplayer doesn't work after the latest patch (Dec 13) and the developers seem to have disappeared.So, to summaraize, I'd give the game somewhere around a 5/10 at the moment and I can't recommend it at it's current (14.99) price point, or at any price point if no working multiplayer is a deal breaker for you.  Otherwise for a single player ARPG it's probably worth checking out at $5.00 or less.			"

Also, auto-targetting that only works when enemies are agro'ed to you)- Stats and achievements are bugging out constantly, my stats are not recorded and at first I didn't unlock any achievement, untill suddenly I got them all at once and even ones I shouldn't even receive...- Bugs Bugs Bugs Bugs Bugs- Invisible walls at random places or maybe these are just more bugs... I dunno.It looks kinda decent, but don't be fooled by the screens/trailers, you should avoid this game like the plague.			"

												Only worth it if you buy it at deep discount on sale. I got it as part of a bundle for very little money so I am happy with it, but if I paid full price I would be upset.  It is an OK game if you can get it very cheap, but the interface is horrible and the voice acting is not very good either.  If you are itching for another game that is like torchlight or Diablo, but a far weaker version, then this is a way to kill some time.			"

												I don't really recommend it directly but there is no soso button. I still gave it a yes to encourage future indie gaming as i'm fed of the 3 hours long SPs and MP focused AAA boreness nowadays. If you don't have high expectations than this game will give you some nice hours (at least more than 3-5 hours).BE WARNED it has numerous bugs! Some friendly like stuck mobs waiting to be killed, funny bugs like floating trees or trees without trunk or nasty bugs like invincible enemies buging you through a level (fortunately it only happens on a few levels and only if you stay too long on it). The game excels in visuals and sound/music. Some levels are just beautiful like the Glacier or Gardens. The music is nice Diablo (1) like throughout the game, but some may find it annoying. The sound effects sometimes are very good except the barbarian voice that is annoying/scary/funny, sounds like he needs some serious talk with a psychiatrist and absolutely do not fit with his apperance.In overall it seems the devs took some time into the game but they had not enough resources.If you give it a try choose the witch, her basic magic 'gun' don't eat mana and forget alchemy skill route as that is a total mess . BTW this girl can be nudified ingame. Maybe the devs fear someone mod their game (who? why?) with a nude patch so they included it. I have never seen such offense in other offical games. Oh well it's there though you won't see too much.			"

												First impressions after a short bit with the game. The graphics aren't too bad, they're passable, better than what I would expect out of some low budget indie efforts, but after having played some amazingly beautiful indie games (such as Dust: An Elysian Tail, FEZ, Monaco, Mark of the Ninja, Sine Mora), the graphics are average at best. Animations are extremely stiff, and lack liveliness, which is inexcusable, considering the animator tools available on the market. One other gripe is that the in-game text doesn't scale properly to well-known resolutions, such as 720p, which makes things hard to read sometimes.Graphics aside, how does the intial game play? It's again, average. The point-click-die-loot system is in place, but targeting leaves something to be desired, requiring more precision than most ARPGS I've played to kill something (minus Realms of Ancient War, which has terrible mouse controls). The menu paneling is quite difficult to manage, especially in the inventory, when some standard conventions such as the Shift-click don't even exist. Minor quibbles overall, which can be improved with some feedback to the devs. If they even respond anymore to the feedback.There's some unique ideas here, such as the inclusion of an alchemy system and a crafting system, which I have yet to try out, but it looks fairly well fleshed out.There's quite a few bugs that I've noticed while playing it that is irritating, and should not be in a non-beta product whatsoever. For instance, when the framerate dips even a little, the sound should not start skipping like it was being played on a record player. Seriously. Or when a help message pops up in the middle of combat, then is dismissed, then the PC continues to swing/shoot like a madman, irregardless of input. Weird little things like that, and I encountered them in a very short amount of time, so who knows what else there is.One last thing of note: Turn your sound off. Seriously. The sound effects are terrible. And the voice acting is even worse. And not in the hammy-B-movie kind of way. It's just bad. There's no punch to the sound effects, and there's nothing but headache-inducing voicing throughout.			"

It's even hard to find a specifict aspect to prey upon, therefore I'll just try to give an idea of all the things that are wrong with this game:- Graphics: (not a bid deal) but still the graphical design/visuals/effects are terrible.- GUI/Menus: when/if they work their usability is way below average.- Multiplayer: didn't even manage to try it, as the game is seriously bugged and trying to host a multiplayer game will result in your character to become corrupted and unplayable.Even with a 75% discout I would never suggest anyone to bother with this♥♥♥♥♥♥ you might wanna just go play path of exile instead or basically any other action RTS, you wont find anything worse than this anyways.

												Iesabel looks like a lower budget version of Diablo 3. My main reason to buy it was because I wanted to play with a friend who lives in another country and has a Linux computer. However when we tried to play multiplayer we couldnt get it to work. Hosting the game proved impossible and joining by putting in an IP address gave a loading screen forever. The steam ""join game"" button doesnt work either. My verdict - If you want another Diablo for single player then buy this game. If you want multiplayer wait until they fix it.Ill update my review when and if multiplayer is fixed.			"

I've also had armor and weapons disapear when i tried to equip them. It's over all a poor quality game. Not worth it on the .99 cent rack. Will uninstall if Multiplayer is not fixed soon.

												Terrible Game.Cons:- Two characters to choose from, barbarian or witch, non-customizable [beyond name].- Poor tutorial (Took some time to get past the first gate, ultimately I had to left-click and hold on the character to drag through the gate.)- Difficult to make-out character in fields [aside from bad camera angles -large hills block view], overgrowth in terrain is too large.- Basic repetive sounds, voices.- Random left-click melee attacking -throws spells and swings stick intermittently (right-click always throws spells).- Most loot was for the barbarian class only.- Game studders badly [full-screen or window] until starting the campaign.Pros:- It's playable. (Not the worst game I've ever tried).- runs fairly well (no ""Interactive Grass"" or ""Post-Processing"", but otherwise full resolution) on a old (Mid 2009) Mac Book Pro [Intel Duo-core 3.06, NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT 512 MB, 8 GB].I brought the old MBP along on vacation, and wanted to try playing an RPG; I tryed to like this one.Fail.

I dont know what more to say but that its clearly a port of a mobile game and a poorly one at that so my advice is to stay away from this game and spend your time somewhere else.			"

												I got Iesabel at pretty sensible price so can't complain. Generally it's good game, not the best but once you play more than 50 minutes (it can be challenging) and get used to controls it's okay and gets more interesting. It's not classic hack and slash game and not diablo either as it is totally different story. I can understand where all the comparison come from as the game has similar art style / atmosphere.Played a little bit more Iesabel and started enjoying it.Pros:- nice artstyle - in general but hate the 'barbarian' artsyle- good lighting- okay story line, sometimes a little bit tedious especially withing first 30 minutes when you fighting huge insects and bunch of wolves :) but later on gets more interestingCons:- bad controls and some areas could be improved- no multiplayer (I personally don't mind)- hate the barbarian voice, terribleWould I recommend Iesabel?

												I grew up with Diablo and Diablo 2, and I'm a huge fan of Titan Quest. Iesabel looked interesting, but fell far short of the value, even as a casual diversion.The English translation (at least) is poor, but it's readable and can be understood, so that's not so bad; and, at least the voice acting is enjoyably awful. I giggled like a child every time my witch leveled up and cheerfully proclaimed, ""I am getting skilled!"" However, when paired with the buggy combat and clunky controls that don't always work right, it all became a real downer. The whole experience feels unfinished and poorly-programmed, as if a lot of time and resources were spent developing graphics and the actual gameplay was thrown in as an afterthought. Unfortunately, in a Diablo-clone, that really defeats the purpose.The aiming is terrible, even with auto-aim turned on. Every other time I tried to attack an enemy, my character would shoot in whatever direction she happened to be facing at the time, without turning. The skills are poorly detailed and mysterious; you can really only figure out what some of them do by putting points into them and attempting to use them. Maybe most frustrating of all, there's very little in the way of help or information available; tutorial pop-ups can be turned on for new characters, but all the features that gamers have come to recognize as standard and even fundamental in this type of game, nowadays, are absent: No windows appear when you hover over anything (you have to left-click to bring up a separate, static window), descriptions are vague or nonexistent, and when played at fullscreen resolutions, the text can be eye-watering to try and read.The clincher for me, though, was the story. I admit a certain bias: The device used at the very beginning is one of my pet peeves, but that's because it's bad writing. Like, Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits bad: You're apparently one of several heroes summoned by the ""Shaman"" who is the head of the Council of Wizardry. He has seen a great darkness threatening to destroy blah blah blah. All humanity blah exposition blah evil blah proper noun blah tragedy blah destiny blah blah and for some reason these mighty heroes and champions are riding in a cart and literally no one is driving, the horse is just going where it wants.Then these demons or whatever attack and kill everyone but you. You go the Shaman, who's nearby. He wears a fur shawl and lives in the tiniest hut.The tiniest.It is a filthy, dirty, tiny yurt.And when you tell him what happened, he says you must prove your innocence because he can't know who actually killed the other ""heroes"" or you'll be put to death as a traitor in 5 days. ""By the laws of our people...""When you say ""How dare you call me a liar,"" this dirty, mean, weird man proclaims that he is THE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL OF WIZARDRY AND HE WILL END YOUR MISERABLE LIFE.""BUT YOU BROUGHT ME HERE. YOU SUMMONED ME. YOU KNEW I WAS A DESTINED HERO. YOU HAD A VISION. WHY WOULD I LIE, THERE WERE DEMONS. I'M STILL COVERED IN THEIR BLOOD.""""Nope. Go to town and do sidequests or I, in my dirty yurt - my durt - will kill you, even though you are a foreigner who is only here because of me and even though you were attacked by the demons from my vision who I summoned you to battle against, fifty yards from where I sleep as head of the Council of Wizardry.""So I lost interest. :|			"

												This is the biggest waste of money I've ever made, and considered a $3.49 that says something. It appears that the developer never even tested that the game worked!!1. Creating a new character didn't work for me until the third time, the other times it would just freeze at some loading screen.2. You can't load an existing character! When selecting it and clicking load, nothing happens.3. When creating a game over multiplayer, you can't create a character, hence you must start a single-player game first.4. The game should support cross-platform across mobile and desktop devices, but you need to enter an IP adress. Good luck hosting a game and having people join it on your phone with an IP adress you share with hundreds of others, even your PC is likely to be hard to find. There's no lobby, no friend system, nothing to help you find your friend's servers.That being said, the one time I did get into game but couldn't load again, the game wasn't even worth my time anyway. I was expecting a Diablo clone, but even this the game didn't manage to do even remotely as good as any other clone on the market.			"

This game looked good from the store page.  However, the development team is awhol since i bought it.  there are a lot of things needing fixing, and one of them being multiplayer... i did manage to host a lan game but internet play is heavily broken and the devs are not getting back to folks so it leads me to believe a couple things... they abandoned the project... or they dont care to fix a major component to a game heavily advertised as multiplayer... if you are buying this game for anything other than single player mode i would strongly suggest you keep looking for the game you seek elsewhere.

												I just finished playing the game.  Here are my thoughts...Should the game have been released?  Yes.  Should it cost money?  No.  Why?  Because the game is so full of bugs that I would honestly consider this a Beta and NOT a full release.  Until they are fixed this should be free.  Some of the bugs: the game minimizes to desktop regularly; the player will get stuck in terrain; some monsters glitch causing them to not able to be hit but are still able to do damage to you; the game does crash though rarely...etc...Gameplay...  I understand that the developers' primary language isn't English.  I can accept this.  But I cannot accept a translation that leads to very juvenile, confusing and idiotic dialogues.  Most of the time I felt like the NPCs and even my character were 3 years old.  It was completely annoying and made the game's plotline difficult to follow.  Near the end of the game I just didn't care anymore and clicked my way through all the conversations.  Also, the lack of proper translation leads to Axes and Mauls being labelled as ""2 handed swords"" and etc...  Basically, most weapons are labelled as a ""sword"".The fighting...  The game missed the mark on this.  One would think that you could click on the enemy and be able to kill them.  But this isn't always the case as lootable items laying on the ground will interfere with your targeting.  Sooner or later you will just click on the Sword button in the action toolbar to attack and stop clicking on enemies to attack.  I only played as the male fighter but I noticed that if I only used my sword attack I didn't receive much damage.  As soon as I tried any of the special skills I immediately recieved a large amount of damage.  This made it so that I completely stopped using or caring about any of the special skills as the use of them would severely damage or kill me.Let me wrap this up...  The game in this current state is playable and at times very enjoyable.  But because of the many shortcomings I can not recommend paying for this game.  Until these things are fixed, I would advise you to NOT get this game.			"

												A remarkably fun, simple ARPG! The bad news: It's still somewhat buggy on PC. Interface issues and leftovers from touch controls that weren't converted properly still litter the game. The good news: They're actively working on it! They didn't just do a quick port to PC and leave it as is to lure in unsuspecting consumers. I believe there's been at least two patches since I purchased it personally, both of which have a decent list of fixes. Every patch is an improvement, so pick it up, store it in the vault, and keep an eye on it!TL;DR: An investment. Built for mobile gaming, so good for quick pick-up-and-play when you don't have much time, but still rough around the edges.-----EDIT: 1/11/16As of this time, the rough around the edges comment is the biggest factor here. As it turns out the potential was never really reached, and the devs appear to have given up on it. While I haven't played it on the PC recently I have more experience with the mobile version, and I've been following the community. I hate to turn a positive review into a negative one but Iesable could have been so much better, they just seem to have stopped caring.As such I can no longer recommend it. There are simply too many bugs and bad design choices left behind, as well as previously-working features that no longer function. If only they had kept up the same level of support it had started with, perhaps it have been a worthy add to any ARPG fan's collection.			"

												If you're looking for a Diablo like game there are quite a few options out there and all of them are better than this game.  First of all, even though it is advertised as having co-op and multi-player it doesn't actually work and the developers seem to have abandoned a potential fix. Also if you're an achievement hunter, not only you won't be able to complete some of the multi-player achievements but there are also others that won't track your progress and unlock.  The gameplay itself is very tedious and kind of slow paced at times and there are a number of bugs that may be annoying although nothing game breaking from what I gather. It's a pretty typical story and it has your run of the mill quests that won't impress or even entertain. It gets a bit better in terms of pacing and thus your enjoyment if you're patient with it and/or if you find the right items...   Even though it has a lot of tehnical and gameplay problems I personally managed to get over them somehow and enjoyed the amount of hours I played (I'm also probably going to finish the game). I would recommend this game only if you ran out of options and was willing to pay the price for it.			"

												TL;DR - Don't buy, terrible game by many standards.Imagine a bad mobile game for the PC and you have Iesabel. The controls are mostly unresponsive. The voice acting is...*shudder* terrible. The descriptive text is tiny and hard to read. Double clicking equipment items in your inventory while in store leads to disappearing items. The tutorials refer to buttons in the wrong location. Only 2 classes to choose (witch/barbarian) with very limited skill selection (8 offensive, 5 passive, 3 aura, and 8 or 9 crafting). Skill points go into crafting OR offensive skills. Lots of invisible walls. Skills have pretty long cooldowns. Gameplay is supposed to feel action packed with swarms of monsters but with slow controls and long cooldown... falls pretty far short from being exciting. At least it was on sale...			"

												Wow, this game is so wonky! It's as if the developers have never played a game before or perhaps they just didn't care about refining any of the functions or mechanics of the game. Every single action is awkward and barely functions. The writing is either from a non-native english speaker or someone with a 4th grade education. The graphics are poorly done by any standard, with washed out lines and absent details. The audio is acceptable although the generic sounds are probably from open source libraries. Even the tutorial/guide is incorrect, directing you to wrong locations for GUI items. This is just the sort of frequent oversight and lack of quality found everywhere else in the game. If it had cost me more than $2 I would have been upset. As it is I was able to slog through 40 minutes before I could no longer tolerate the miserable hit box detection. I got my money's worth from the game, which isn't saying much. I advise you to pass on this game altogether.			"

												Meh.  The graphics are decent (although dated), the Health orb is difficult to see as it gets lower, because it gets darker resulting in your inability to accurately judge low health levels.  The animations are stiff and the game is still very buggy.  Numerous crashes, not to mention weird glitches where all animations stop.The interface is difficult to use, needlessly ornamental in some parts while at the same time difficult to tell the ornamental from functional pieces, resulting in a bit of a Human factors and interface design disaster.The voice acting is b-movie at best.  The barbarian sounds like he needs to start his own Death Metal band in Norway instead of  voicing game characters.  On the plus side, this is one of the few games that actually recognized my main monitor resolution correctly (in a multi-monitor setup) without me having to putz with the interface controls manually.  It also has a nice sizing feature for the UI but then doesn't do so correctly for the text resulting in a big dissapointment.If this was an indie effort, it needs about 3-6 mos of polish yet.  But since its actually a published game, I'd have to say it was rushed instead.Save your money and go play Diablo again, or for that matter The Incredible Van Helsing.  Save the effort on this one.

												A subpar action RPG.  Not completely atrocious, but doesn't do anything well.The controls are the worst part, especially with the ranged character.  There's no ""stand still"" button, so if you miss the enemy's click box by even a pixel, you'll run toward it.  Abilities target awkwardly, and often incorrectly.  The magic arrow spell travels in the direction your character is facing rather than where your cursor is aiming, while the summon spell frequently gives error messages saying you ""can't do this,"" forcing you to move to a spot where you can do this.Graphics are uninspired in design and crude in execution.  Dialogue is written in Engrish with numerous typos and grammatical errors.  Voice acting is flat and apathetic.  Some games can make up for mediocre gameplay with good presentation.  Iesabel is not one of them.I lost interest when the game locked up.  Protip: If you're being attacked, avoid area transition gates.Iesabel might be fun for a bit if you get it as part of a bundle, but I don't recommend purchasing it on its own.			"

												This game looks very familiar if you know games like Diablo, Sacred, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing or other games that are played from the Top-down perspective. I thought this was a similar game but must realize that this game is a ported Tablet computer game. Developed for iOS/Android the company decided to port this game to the PC platform and that's the root of the disaster this game finally is like. The controls are a mess, the graphics are acceptable only for devices with low capabilities, the story isn't relevant, the developers have left the scene.If you think you can sustain some of this, the God-awful controls you can't. Elementary control functions like point & click for an attack do not work, because this crappy engineered software isn't able to work in a non touch based environment. Mouse and keyboard functions of the PC are stacked on top of this sad control interface and work only if your karma is pure and clean and, of course,  air pressure in Angola is an odd number. Completely unusable. D o  n o t  b u y! "

By far the worst A-RPG I have ever playedIm lucky that I got this game in a bundle. Because everything more than 1 $ would have been a waste. -Nonsense Story-The dialogues are TERRIBLE and dont make any sense.-The german translation was made with the google translator, im not even kidding. -When someone told me that this game was made with the Diablo II engine I would have believed him because the graphics are ugly as hell.-Coop is bugged-You have no idea what to do or where to go after acceppting a quest, because there are like no waypoints.I could barely take this game more than 2 hours, but those are the things I noticed SO FAR....Dont even want to know what people find once they dig deeper.How it really was: I started the game and noticed it is ugly as hell, okay no matter im no graphic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..lets try it maybe its fun. I choose the Mage and start playing. My hero always interrupts autoattacking when my cursor is not EXACTLY over the enemy. Half of my autoattacks fly through things and sometimes my camera gets locked on a chest or a barrel which I dont even want to attack. The last 5 minutes of gameplay I unlocked the following achievements: Kill 2500 monstersKill 7500 monstersKill 20000 monstersKill 50000 monstersKill 100000 monsters..... How? I was doing a quest where I was supposed to kill a bear, the bear got stuck in a wall and suddenly all those achievments popped up. That was enough....HOW BUGGY can a game be. I support and admire a lot of small indie devs and hell no I dont need AAA title to be happy. But this is just TRASH. The devs know that, they ignore their community and dont respond to anyone in the forums. Pathethic.			"

The thing is though unlike Diablo which has MPer and LAN play this game while promising it before does not.  It says it does in the game menus but it has never worked.  Now as for actually playing this game moving through the different areas is frustrating as many times you see areas where you should be able to move freely only to get jammed into an invisible barrier.  Not cool.  In regards to weaponry and armor you have all the usual stuff with various stats on them.  You also have a skill tree and a rating system for different attributes that you can increase with points you earn.  You can also reset them at certain places for a fee which is nice.  In regards to classes  I think there are maybe three.  Also with this game there is a crafting system but I haven't played the game long enough to get a go at it.  For the price of $5.49 Canadian which it sells at now well all I can say is that it isn't much for a game but honestly I would look to other similar games instead.  I do not like it when a developer promises MPer and LAN and can't deliver and it is made worse by the constant reminder of it being present in the menu options.			"

												Very underpolished and not very fun. Slow speed of the entire game makes for a dull experience and while the change of controls from the typical action/rpg setup, is an appreciated effort .....Don't try to fix what isnt broken. Big pass, even for the sale price.			"

												This is a bad game. This makes Diablo 3 look good. You can not controll your character like a normal dungeon crawler. The combat forces you to use your keyboard to face the enemy in order to attack it. Your use q for your basic attack which only fires in the direction you are facting, Meaning you have to turn your self around which does not work with the mouse. For 15 bucks. It is a waste of money. The controls are so bad. Get Path of Exile or Torchlight 1 and 2. Stay away from this game.			"

												Iesabel is a cracking little RPG! Just look past it's faults...mainly the crazy control system. So you may have been playing RPG's since Baltamora was in the chart, but this is no ordinary RPG. ASWD keys to move the map and mouse to move character? No chance 'S' to attack, it's bonkers! You have to love the Barry White voice over, I defy you not to laugh everytime you character utters.. ""More gold for me!"" Parts of the map are locked by, ""I can not go that way yet""... Apart from all this it's fun and you will have a barrel of laughs at the silly urrgh! sound FX of a hitting a wolf. But please developers where is the energy bar?			"

No DLCNo Trading CardsThis game is like Titan Quest, Diablo II, PoE, etc. but it by far is at the bottom of that list. its not that bad if your like me and a easy to please type. i would rate it 5/10 compared to the games listed above.Indie Title so got to cut them some slack i think based in Poland and my girlfriend is part polish so it works. This game needs a good healthy patch and it would be in most peoples library. i paid around $1.78 and i feel that was a decent price.Seems like a lot bought this game in mind of Co-op which i guess fizzled out, the forums are covered with these angry people same as reviewsAround 2 Hours into and Level 10, its a Stat and Perk + points leveling System, and random loot upgrades your weapons and Armor, as well as potions some Alchemy Crafting, Quest and Grind Driven, seems like there is a certain amount of Quests per Act and there is 3 Acts.there are Shrines for Buffs and refilling Hp as well. monster respawn while your clearing the map.No Stash or Shared Stash that i know of as of level 10. Rank/Perk into Crafting from Potions to TP and ID Scrolls and Gems.Town Npcs offer Quests and Npcs can be found anywhere in town in the wilds etc.Barbarian Level 10 Skilled into Armor, Shield, One hand damage, and AoEs. have not dabbled in Alchemy though got plenty of mats you pick plants and find stuff in loot.Witch Have not tried.All in All this game would sit Last on my list compared to PoE, Titan Quest, Torchlight.the character himself looks awful moves awful and attacks really awful, i started using AoE skills so i could hit stuff half the time i am swinging the wrong way.But only 2 hours into it and hit level 10 and i feel i want to keep playing.

												It is not a bad game!Dispite the known issues posted in comm and revs below, i really want make a short counterstatement.Of couse, if i look at the fact that some gameplay functions are missing (or simply do not work) that can be blamed to be essential for a normal H&S tiltle, one could tend to judge Jesabel badly.But if you take the main points of criticism out of the discussions in my opinion there are only 2 or 3 grave things to count:- hold position key (and free key binding)- avatar-NPC orientation and collision- some small graphic issuesI mean, look at gountlet e.g. - it do not even have save, loot or progress options implemented and is really going so far to call itself a great H&S tittle!!! pha!I do like the stile of the game exactly because of it's old school behaviour and it's nonopulent graphics.

												I've dumped about 5 hours into it, and I'm done.  I've had it.  The voice acting on both characters is terrible, particularly the barbarian.  I had to stop playing it and switched to the witch.  There is no other voice dialog in the game; everything else is text.  And it's bad.  You would think they would run a spell checker against it or at least proof read it before implementation, but they apparently missed those steps.  While this, alone, doesn't make the game bad, it does indicate that there may not have been as much attention to detail as there should have been.  And it shows in other places, too.  Combat, for instance.  It's frustrating as H3ll.  You cannot 'root' your character in place, as you can in other similar games during combat.  As a result, you end up running all over the place.  Couple that with terrible pathing logic, and you have a disaster specific to combat.In the end, this is one that I simply cannot play all the way through.  Van Helsing, Path of Exile, the entire Diablo series, Titan Quest series,  Dungeon Siege series, and many more have I traversed in their entirety.  Iesabel, however, won't be included in that list.  It will be one of those rare instances where it is uninstalled prior to completion.			"

Maps are small and world feels like running in corridors. Inventory is a mess. Barbarian: The fighting is loose and boring. You dont even hit sometimes or he does not even start to swing his weapon? Started playing easy to see if it helped but lol nooooo.I did find out that its easier playing a witch than barbarian, almost as barbarian was second thought?You should be prepared that the game will punish you even on easy when fighting enemies in groups or bosses.

												Sorry, not recommended right now.Needs some immediate fixes for the Witch to be playable:* needs visual/sound feedback when damage is taken, and/or player damage numbers* needs a ""hold ground"" button (e.g. hold Shift key) to prevent movement while casting, otherwise you end up running into melee range and cannot cast spells any more :(* ideally spells should fire toward the mouse pointer, or at enemy between player and mouse.

												Feels really rough and clunky. Graphics are bad (text rendering is awful, and in the main window it's not even clear where the paths are). interface is awkward (no consistent location for closing windows, sometimes escape works, sometimes it doesn't—reminiscent of skyrim's interface when it first launched). Sometimes left-clicking on a monster will attack, sometimes the character will just look at the monster. Only two characters available.Basicaly, if you are looking for a cheap action RPG without Blizzard's always-connected DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, then Van Helsing for Windows* or Torchlight I/II are good choices. This, not so much.* Unplayably broken on OS X but I hear it works ok on Windows.			"
