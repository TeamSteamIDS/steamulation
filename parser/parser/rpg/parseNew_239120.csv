												Final Fantasy III for steam is the pretty much the same version that was released for android and DS. It works very well and automatically maps the controller which is great. There haven't been any bugs as far and work as you would hope. The game itself is a gem and one that any RPG fan should have a go at if you haven't already. One downside is the price, I feel putting it higher than VII or VIII on steam is unfair due to the small amount of work they must have done to bring it to steam. To see my playthrough start here:

												I recommend Final Fantasy III as a game, but I do not recommend the Steam Port of this game.It's a beautiful story with beautiful gameplay. The spells and job systems are wonderful and I enjoyed what I could of it. This version of the game is a very good game and brings back memories for me of the NES version. However I can't feel good about recommending this port. There are a LOT of game-breaking bugs in this port. Things that set back your story several hours of gameplay, some that make it so you have to beat a boss twice, thrice or more times, etc... I've managed to make it to the second-last area and can no longer continue forward because the game won't register that I have a key item that's clearly in my inventory, for example. I've run into several bugs and until the port is fixed somehow, I don't think I'll actually be able to complete the game. I know many other people have run into these bugs as well.			"

												Even though basically a port from the Nintendo DS version, this is much worth playing if you've been lagging like me and waited until now to play this classic. If you already played the DS version, nothing new here. Please note this is the true III sequel and NOT the III that NA played on SNES. My only two gripes are these: 1. If you play with a controller and it loses connection/power, reconnecting won't register with the game and you're forced to restart the game. 2. The last areas of the game. Not only is there no save point, but you get the final batch of new jobs so late in the game. You're forced to grind for a few hours.Otherwise, still worth playing if you're a Final Fantasy fan and have yet to play the earlier games in the series.			"

												Final Fantasy III has seen many make-overs, and this one is pretty much a port of the one on the DS with just a bigger resolution. But still, if you're a fan of Final Fantasy or love JRPG's, then you should still pick this up, especially if you haven't played this game already.Here's a quick look video so you can see for yourself what this game is like. But if you'd rather have a simple pros/cons/unmentionables list of the game, continue below.

			Noble of Lost Pause take a quick look at Final Fantasy III, a JRPG port to the PC from the DS. Let the nostalgia and random encounters sink in nice and good now. Yes, just like that.		

As promised, the pros and cons breakdown.+Good, relaxing music. FF has always been good about this.+The ability to customize your party to your playstyle with the flexible job system. Anybody can be anything. Why not girl warriors and guy white mages? Break those stereotypes!+Strategic, turn-based combat. Some may prefer action, but I count this as a plus because you play at your own pace and the battles can be close sometimes.+Great exploration. There's hidden passages to treasure, optional dungeons, and mazes to loot littered everywhere, even at the beginning of the game. Did I mention you get an airship early on?+You can quick save anywhere. Super handy for any RPG and a person always on the go.?Because of the exploration, you can wander into places you're grossly unprepared for and get stomped into the ground.?The story is your typical ""you're the chosen one to save the world and help people along the way."" I'm not really bothered by it, but some people who want something different may be turned off by it.-No options menu besides changing resolution. Square-Enix actually makes really good option menus for PC, so I was a little sad to see that there wasn't even AA to get rid of some of the jaggies.-Because this is an old port, though a good one, the graphics aren't exactly breath-taking like the opening CG cutsceen. Personally I don't care since the good gameplay matters to me over graphics, but a lot of people get turned off by dated graphics unfortunately, even more so when they expect more from Square-enix.-It's pricey for what it is. But that's the FF brand for you.-No voice acting. While not the end of the world, it certainly does help immerse you into the world.Overall, it's a really good game, and it's nice to have an old-school RPG every now and again. Remember that childhood, my friends. Remember it.			"

												I have always enjoyed the first two Final Fantasy games, but their stories were sparse, relying more on conversations with random town folk to help fill in the blanks than to tell a proper tale. While Final Fantasy III still shows its age and might not have the sophistication found in later RPGs, it is still a worthy look back at a game that helped to continue to redefine the genre. This version of the game on PC is based on the graphically updated version that made its way onto the Nintendo DS back in 2006. The visuals got an 3D overhaul, with a widened aspect ratio and some new features as well. If you are familiar with the DS or iPhone/iPad versions of the game this PC release will feel very familiar, but it still plays out nicely on a bigger screen.Themes that persist and remain familiar in future Final Fantasy games such as the Warriors of Light and job class systems help populate this story. The job system is bare bones compared to what we are used to now in the series (and other games that use similar systems), and the game uses it more as a second experience system. On the one hand the characters have conventional experience systems that level up their physical attributes, and then there's the job levels which represent their skills. Managing both is easy, and the system does encourage players to jump their characters through multiple jobs, though there is some grinding involved as there is a warmup process where a character needs to fight a certain number of battles with a role before they're comfortable with it and can use its skills properly. You don't want to be fighting tough enemies in such a state, so you'll generally grind through easy battles each and every time you change classes.This is a classic Final Fantasy title, which of course has both good and bad connotations. It means lots of menus and level grinding and of course chocobos and Cid and things. It is a welcome rush of nostalgia to come back to a game like this, which has aged well despite being nearly two and a half decades old. I'd be lying if I said that the graphical overhaul didn't make the game far more palatable (or the fact that the original game was never released in English), but the core mechanics should also appeal to old school JRPG fans. The game gets off to something of a slow start, with a lot of story and limited exploration during the first dozen hours or so, but once it opens up it is every bit the exploration-filled adventure Final Fantasy is known for, filled with little secrets to find and fun and diverse characters.Having just played Bravely Default a few months ago and seeing familiar themes such as the four different adventurers brought together by circumstance and the presence of crystals as a focal point to the story, I could not help but be amused with how timeless the narrative themes are. That being said, Bravely Default showed just how much further game storytelling has gone in making something rich out of the basic thematic construct. That is not to say that Final Fantasy III has a poor story, but compared to the more modern Japanese role-playing game, it is fascinating to see how far the medium has come.If you have already played the DS or iOS version of this game, there may not be enough of a reason to purchase it on Steam now. However, if you missed that opportunity before and want to experience an important part of Final Fantasy's early evolution, this is an excellent way to do so. The character depth and story detail might feel somewhat lacking compared to newer JRPG titles, but there is an expansive world here that begs for exploration as you grow your characters for future challenges. The overall package is an easy one to recommend.Recommended "

Refreshed & challenging // Recommended for fans of the franchise+ Inventory & spell system is rudimentary compared to modern RPG standards, but still manages to feel polished & well-implemented+ Job system works well with combat, & offers that little extra bit of additional customization of play+ Having to cast some status-inducing spells on one's own party to affect overworld advancement is a very nice touch, & makes the game feel more involved when outside of combat+ Autosave; restarts from exact position on exit, making dungeons vastly more convenient, especially if one needs to exit the game in the midst of one+ Visuals & audio have had a satisfying overhaul+ Agreeable length; one feels as though they are gatting their money's worth of the product in terms of time investment- Characters have precious little depth or development (especially compared to most other installments of the series), & the often uninspired dialogue doesn't much help- Plot is comparatively shallow, and diverges only slightly from the original product- Destinations are often unclear; it's all too easy to get turned around & not know where the next town is locatedLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

Square should feel bad that they have a game of this low stability.Played for 1 hour after my purchase last year, got the locked job change glitch.Played it for 4 hours recently and got the locked job change glitch again on a new file.

												My favorite game of all time. The story and characters aren't particularly deep, especially compared to later games in the series, but deep Job Class-based gameplay, a healthy challenge, plenty of varied locations, and an excellent soundtrack (my personal favorite) all help this game hold up well even today. Despite its short length compared to other Final Fantasies and a slight emphasis on grinding, Final Fantasy III stands tall among the typical turn-based RPGs. Some people, myself included, think it stands at the very top.			"

												Heed my warning and wait to purchase Final Fantasy III until they've patched it. I received a BS response from Square-Enix, simply telling me to verify the installation/game cache integrity (yeah, because I'm *that* much of a moron and didn't already try that... thanks for nothing!) Please note that multiple users have been having the same issues:Basically, the game bugs out so bad to where your character will be sailing in a ship one second, then walking atop the ocean the next. You will also enjoy enemy encounters every other step, chests in dungeons randomly resetting, the inability to change your characters' classes, and -- my personal favorite -- in the beginning of the game, you get trapped inside Castle Sasune because the game bugs out and SHUTS THE FRONT GATE ON YOU. INGENIOUS.Think merely restarting the game will solve the problem? Don't be fooled. The game will still be glitchy as hell, just later on, is all. For example, despite having procured the Nepto Eye, the Nepto Dragon will STILL attack.Is it guaranteed that your game will be glitchy as hell? No. But if I were you, I wouldn't chance it. It's a known issue among the Steam community, and Square-Enix needs to fix it. Wait to purchase.			"

												FF3 is a decent fantasy rpg that features a short and straightforward plotline. It boasts numerous job choices and combinations similar to its NES counterpart and the tactics series. This game is of course not without drawbacks. Among other titles in the FF series, I would rank this as slightly  above average due to one or two missing (but important) features. The game does not have an option to adjust battle speed. This was something you could find in FF games of previous generations so it's a shame that this isn't built into the PC port of the game. Keep in mind that there's an achievement for getting all jobs to level 99 which will require a minimum of 2254 battles (that's if you're super efficient) so this particular option would have been a godsend. Content-wise, I also feel that it is below/lacking in comparison to the 2 other games which are also on Steam. This is purely subjective but I feel that the price point needs to be adjusted after considering this factor. It's a shame because the game ends before it truly begins. You get your last set of jobs way too close to the end of the game.Despite these criticisms, I can still recommend FF3. It follows a nostalgic formula that most of the other games in the series observe. The game is especially good if you are a modern gamer who missed out on the treasured experience of playing the first half of the series.			"

												I love every FF game, but the glitches in this version are beyond words. Got trapped in the castle because my last team member decided to leave my party and reappear guarding the place again. Next was the Nepto temple where I could not interact with the statue after I got the eye.... and now forever stuck no matter how many times I kill the boss.EDIT: After many trial and errors of running the Nepto Temple dungeon. I acquired not 1 but 4 eyes as both the chests and the boss kept resetting. I was finally able to interact with the statue. However I lost my Job ability!... Back I went to solve the issue and found that if I skipped the chests and defeated the boss first I was able to interact with the statue. Thus keeping by job ability and able to progress! (saved asap and went back for the chests just to check, everything was working fine then!)			"

												First off, I have clicked the DO NOT RECOMMEND button at the bottom of this review. And that's only half true. See, I've been trying to beat the living hell out of this game ever since I bought it almost a week ago and I keep getting stopped by bugs. Below I'm going to list the four bugs I've encountered, and they're pretty catastrophic, but if you save often you'll be fine. Except that you can't save in dungeons. Luckily, none of these bugs took place in Dungeons.The first bug I encountered: On leaving Castle Sasune I decided to go back to the starting village and see if I missed anything. When I talked to the Elder in town, the storyline restarted and I had to go back through gathering my party, whose levels had all reset to 3, 3, and 4, respectively, by going through all the cutscenes over again.The Second bug I encountered: While on The Enterprise (Boat) I got into a battle, a lot of them, to try and level against the new monsters because YAAY DIVERSITY, only to come out of my 20th or so battle and realize I was standing in the ocean. There was no ship sprite, I was Luneth being followed by Desch.. standing on the ocean. The background music had stopped and I was unable to go back on land, and when I went past the first continent, the Big Rock that bars your passage before defeating Djinn was there again. Wee~ saved to an empty file and reloaded, bug not fixed.The Third bug, and the funniest (in a cruel sort of way): After speaking with a friend about a treasure room just inside the crystal cave, I decided to head back there on The Enterprise (Save Often) and check it out, if only for the Achievement progress. I skipped the first village because I'd already dealt with that bug and I wasn't risking it. Go in to the cave, grab the loot and spot a hole in the floor. So I hop in, figuring the worst that could happen is that I'll have to walk through the crystal room again. NOPE. Game reverts Luneth and party to level 3, 3, 3, and 4 respectively and plays the opening cutscene again. And restarts the storyline, strips you of items and jobs unlocked. FUNNNN. The last bug I found was upon restarting the game after the third bug: I loaded up my save and there I was in the middle fo the Ocean on The Enterprise. I decide to quickly get the hell off this boat before it glitches on me again. Got into a fight with 2 Hermits. Killed them quickly, was back on my boat, and two achievements popped up. Apparently I saved a lot of Gil, because I got both of the Gil-related achievements for nothing.All in all, a great game but I have to play it in small chunks because of the ridiculous amount of bugs I've run into. Its frustrating, and I won't recommend the purchase of this game to any but the most stalwart of Final Fantasy fans.			"

												Just to start off, if you're looking at this game as a potential gateway to getting into traditional JRPG's, don't bother.  It will only serve to put you off the genre all together.  There are just too many things, like lack of save points and some cheap bosses, for someone that may want to play a more old-school game and is looking at FFIII, the earliest available FF game on Steam, as the game to start out with.That said, if you've played a lot of old RPG's growing up, you may find something more to your liking here.  The story and characters are simple.  There's no voice acting, no FMV cutscenes, no minimap or compass to point you in the right direction.  I found all of the above a benefit to the game.  The story parts would be slowed down by voice acting and the generic story would be exposed further if you had to listen to it and instead of just reading text.  While the game is fairly linear, it does a great job at points of making you wonder where to go and there's a real sense of exploration.  There's like five or more villages you don't ever have to go to for any reason that are just there, and despite them being pretty small, it's a cool little thing that you'd never see in a more modern game.The big thing with this game is that in was the introduction of the job-swapping system found in the earlier FF's.  There are twenty plus jobs and they're handed out at set points in the story.  The big problem is the last set of jobs are unlocked extremely late in the game and this makes using them to their fullest a pain.  You can switch jobs on the fly but there's a small penalty to stats for x amount of fights.  It's not a big deal and will only hamper you for a handful of random battles.The big downside to the game is complete lack of effort when redesigning the boss encounters and the final dungeon in its entirety.  Every boss fight boils down to the same thing.  A single enemy will have a strong physical attack that hits one character and strong magic attacks that hits everyone.  Bosses will also always use these attacks back to back without interruption.  This means any character, even with full HP, is liable to get KO'd if they get RNG unlucky when it comes to boss turns versus your characters' turns.  It's such a cheap, low-effort way to add difficulty when designing bosses.  Every turn of every boss fight eventually winds up with you casting a group heal spell on an already fully healed group just to deal with the oncoming attacks. The last dungeon and it's surroundings is one of the worst in RPG's and I'm sure you can find detailed reasons why elsewhere.There's a lot of talk about grinding being necessary in this game and I find that completely overblown.  I never stopped my progress for the explicit grinding of levels/ job levels and beat the game with levels in the very low 50's.  Grinding some levels would have helped for the last boss to serve as an HP buffer but it's not necessary.  As long as you don't continuously change your jobs, you should be able to handle anything the game can throw at you as long you fight every random encounter you come across.  The secret boss though would require a ton, and I mean a ton, of grinding and I didn't bother with it.As for the port, it's a super low effort one of the mobile version, not the DS version.  This means stuff like the UI is ugly and created to be touch based, but lacking in touch suport or mouse control in menus in this version and is just poor all around.  Even things like loading your game while in-game is obtuse.  There are only three save slots for who knows what reason.  I also ran into a problem where all dialogue box text had some type of artifacting or something that I couldn't find a work around for.  All that said, it's still supposedly better the FFIV PC port, which doesn't even have the memorize battle cursor function because it wasn't included in the mobile version and has 15 FPS in battles.  I used the memorize function in FFIII so I'll be missing it when I eventually get around to playing FFIV.  Square just doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥with any of their PC ports so none of this should be a surprise.  Okay, since this was really long, here's a short answer as to whether you should buy and play this game.  Don't if you have no experience with older RPG's.  If you do and are fine with not having things like save points and easily obtainable reviving items, cheap bosses and a terrible final dungeon, you'd probably get some enjoyment out of FFIII.  It's an enjoyable, but clearly flawed game.			"

												This game is an excellent old school Rpg, emphasis on the old school. Remember this game was orginally released April 1990 ( in Japan only), to put that in perspective it, Final Fantasy 1 came out for the NES in America that year! This version is a direct port of the DS version, which updated the graphics to a 3D engine.There is very little hand holding, often you will find yourself on the world map trying to remember a single line of dialogue from an NPC that will direct you. While the flow of the game is pretty good, there is a few times that you will need to grind out levels (and Job levels). Again, part of the old school feeling of this game.The Job system works for the most part and is designed to suit individual playstyles. Unfortunately there is many bosses that die easier to certain group make-ups. This can be a frustrating thing. Also a few of the jobs are direct upgrades from other jobs (white mage / devout or Monk / Black belt) rendering the previous job basically  obsolete.Graphics    Well not the best looking game the graphics do a servicable job. This will not put your system to the test that is for sure!Sound     The music and sound effects are pretty good and definitely have that ""final fantasy"" feel. Story      As mentioned above the flow of the game is ok, but you do find yourself at certain points wondering where to go next (at least I did, anyway). Revisiting a couple of towns and talking to everyone may refresh the memory.Gameplay      Old school! Grinding levels although arguably not required is recommended. The Job levels have a different leveling system, as in they don't level up using Experience points. There is a hidden job point system that sets your levels. To accumulate these job points you perform actions in battle (attack, guard, item, magic etc.)  When JP is accumulated to 99, Job level goes up by 1. Each action (except: Front, Back, Escape, and Flee) will contribute a fixed amount of job points to the character.       My only real complaint is when entering a battle the camera system often scrolls through the enemies. Really it comes down to like 3 seconds but when you're grinding levels it makes each battle longer than maybe it should be, this adds up over time. Again, just a very small gripe.      There is very large portion of the game at the end where you are unable to save. Although I was lucky and got through it all unscathed, I can imagine the frustration of dieing and losing everything after sinking a couple of hours into the dungeon. Save and save often! Even if you don't think you need to!Overall I recommend this game especially if you're into Jrpg, and specifically ones from the past! :)8/10			"

												So, I decided to dress up my review to make it easier to read as its a bit cluttered. As a long time fan of the Final Fantasy Series, I didn't get a chance to play FFIII till way later on an Emulator program on my PC. While I liked it immediately I lost interest after a few days because of the NES styled graphics.  With THIS release, however, the modern player will have a more enjoyable experience than with previous installments. It has improved graphics (well, DS level but definitely better than the NES), monsters are animated, music is a bit less annoying than the .midi's use to be and the way the cutscenes play out are vastly improved over their original versions.FFIII is the story of the Onion Knight, the reimergance of the Warriors of Light and the birth of Final Fantasy's Job Class System. The story is good, although the cast seems a bit ""thrown together"", it's really the mechanics and nostalgia that makes FFIII worth the buy. Random battles, old fashioned grinding (yes, it was popular before WoW and EQ) and FF canon like Moogles (Complete with a lackluster MogNet), Chocobo's, everyones favorite Mechanic / Airship Captain; Cid and the oddest overworld map on any FF game, ever. Overall, even as a slight fan of Mystic Quest (loved the dungeon music) and with my distaste with FFII and XI, FIII still maintains its place HIGH on my list of favoritsm for the FF Franchise. Although, FFIV will always be my favorite of the older series and XIII for the later series. If you've never played it yet but are a fan of the series, a young'un wanting a taste of nostalgic old school gaming or just someone with $15 to blow; come and relive a classic and get ready to have the level up theme stuck in your head for weeks! Kupo, Kupo and Game on!			"

												Good remake of an old favorite.Pros- Job system is interesting with lots of options- Decent amount of grind v. story.  Lots of opportunity to max everything though if that's your thing- Bosses and new mobs can pose a threat- Finishing a job gets you a legendary item for that classCons- Some jobs are worthless- Zero description of Job Points - had to read a guide- Fastest way to level a job?  Just have all your guys Guard 7 times for an automatic job level at the end of the fight.  Should have been based on job special skills - Knights using Defend, Thief using Steal, mages using magic for the biggest boost, medium boost for normal actions like attacking, and very little for using items (unless Scholar) or Guarding.  I've maxed out a lot of the FF games and couldn't force myself to do it here.- Low agility characters/jobs end up at a disadvantage if you don't use the Guard method of job leveling.  They don't get to take an action and thus level slower than everyone else.- Legendary smith - difficult to access without looking at a guide, pops up in random places causing you to fly between two cities until she shows up at just to get your new job weapon, etc.  Poorly conceived.- Nothing carries over when you switch jobs.  It would be nice to keep some residual stats - Knight to White Mage should keep a little defense or vitality.- Save issue during the last boss.  Fight through a dungeon, fight boss, no save option except for quick save (does not allow you to resume there if you die).  Can't teleport or travel back to world map for a full save.  Enter final dungeon - if you happen to approach the final boss first like I did, you're screwed and you get one shotted meaning you lose about 20 minutes of progress and have to watch some really long cutsceens again.All in all, glad I picked it up on sale and got to see what they did with the remake.

												* Started game and everything was zoomed in no matter what resolution was set.  Zoomed in so far that all you could see was the top, left quadrant of the actual image.  Game is so new that there was no troubleshooting help online.  I had to scan through 20 + reviews and forum pages just to find mention of this issue. ---------*** SOLUTION For those of you with the same experience***---------*  Select the FF3.exe file in your steamapps folder. * Right-Click on .exe and select 'Compatibilty'* Now selct the compatibility tab from this window* Toggle the 'disable DPI' setting..... The reason you are having this issue is because you are using a monitor that displays very high DPI.  I'm currently using Apple's Retna display and that is the highest DPI you can get right now besides 4k stuff.  But any monitor capiable of displaying over 1080p will most likley fall in this category. * The only other problem I experienced was a slight gamepad issue where my character wouldn't stop traveling west no matter what I did on the gamepad.  Unfortunatley, travelling west on the world map made me bump into a few mobs that I wasn't geared or leveled for, I died and then was sent back to my original save point which was signicantly far back in my game play.  This really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off--- so I restarted and everything was fine.  If it happens again, I'll simply unplug the controller in hopes that will make it forget the error. Besides those 2 experiences, I would say that I am loving the game.  I never played the DS version nor did have I ever played any ports besides those awful ones for psx from the late 90s.  The game looks so beautiful now that it has been upscaled for PC and looks even better on my 50"" display (sitting 10 feet back of course).I really wanted to give a good review since FF are my favorite games, but unfortunately this PC release came out in 2014 and none of these issues should even exisit in the first place.  High DPI monitors are the future and no game should ever make you have to troubleshoot to find out that it is something this simple.  This game should be patched to auto-detect high DPI displays and allow users first time experience to be a plug n play situation like advertized.  SQUARE:  PLEASE KEEP THE FF REMAKES COMING, JUST DO A BETTER JOB AT LAUNCH!! TAKE MY MONEY PLEASE!!			"

 Pure, unspoiled Final Fantasy at its best. I first played this game back in 2006 when it was introduced stateside to the Nintendo DS and I loved every freaking minute of it. Final Fantasy III is a sweet, charming, and satisfying Final Fantasy experience. The style of the music, the artwork, and the feel of the game has yet to be replicated.Luneth, Arc, Inguis, and Refia are four adventurers who become the Warriors of Light. Their roles in the party are based on which jobs you assign to them that unlock as you progress through the story. The story is simple but engaging enough to want to see through to the end.This game is HARD, especially when you're used to the more modern FF titles. I can't sugarcoat the difficulty at all. You will rarely get a phoenix down, so trips back to town to revive fallen party members may happen frequently. If you are looking for a challenge, you will certainly find it here. It's kinda sad that it took over a decade for this gem to see a US release, but it has already taken place as one of my favorite games of all time and one of my favorite FF titles. Completing this game is one of the most rewarding experiences ever. I recommend getting both FF3 and FF4 on Steam as both are challenging in their own ways but offer different experiences.  "

												Not a review but some preliminary impressions:Make sure you go into the key rebinding option in the launcher if you're going to be using keyboard, to see what the keys are because the game doesn't tell you.Game runs at 30 fps capped, models are low-poly and the textures are so small you can see the chunky pixels. Not a problem for me- just being informative.Game seems great so far, but zooming in to see sparkles in the world for hidden items seems like it could get annoying because the zoom in takes so long.

												I was very exctied to get to play this Final Fantasy title.  I had yet to play it, even on the DS, after all these years.  I welcomed my time in game on Steam with open arms.In short, it was very well worth my time.  Good story, with all the Final Fantasy staples thrown in throughout, and I felt engaged for a majority of it.  A job system that is vast (23 jobs), and fun to learn for each unique job. Plenty of things to do beside just level up your character.  And a fight system when mixed with the job system that became quite in depth.  By the end, I was very happy with my in game time saving the crystals as the fabled Warriors of Light.If you are a collector of in game items, or achievements, this game is loaded with some time consuming ones or just plain hard ones --  Filling the bestiary with every monster in game.  Finding EVERY chest in game.  Leveling EVERY job to 99, on EVERY character. With a few thrown in for really rare boss monsters or weapons.  Plenty of easy, fun achievements as well, and nothing if skipped, that would ruin the full game experience.I was very pleased with the game as a whole.  I didn't play anything else until I was done because it held my attention, and it was a wonderful throw back to a style in the RPG genre, that I for one, truly enjoy and love.  Well, WELL worth the time if this is your type of game.			"

The credits were clips of the various characters in various jobs doing lots of fun animations, some of the bosses too, and that made me feel like they put care into the remake+Varied, fun and difficult bosses that force you to really think about your strategy, and even class composition.+Huge range of jobs to give your characters allowing a huge range of tactics+As is typical of Final Fantasy, a beautiful evocative OST+Charming low-poly graphics+Sidestories within the main quest have charm-Main story isn't exactly deep or meaningful-Final boss is tremendously difficult and can be frustrating if it uses certain movies close together-Saving is only available in the overworld, so if you fail on certain bosses there's a big chunk of the game to replay.

AUDIOCoolVISUAL3D-DSDIFFICULTYConfusing, GrindyVIBEClassicCRAVINGFinal FantasyON SALEOccasionalPROS: Overworld chibi style is very cute. CG cutscenes are gorgeous, battle system and music is classic. Dungeons are fun, story is as engaging as a typical fantasy game like this could be. Glad they didn't add too much excess story to this game; it feels a bit bare-bones from that, but it's preferred over additions that would stray away from original FF3. CONS: There are tech problems with this port. I myself have run into two issues: a crash that set me back, and a story-related glitch. It is not intuitively explained at all in favor of explanations on the heavy side. Job system is confusing. There are several points in the game where you can lock yourself out of finishing your beastiary. Old DS info is still in this port, meaning some DS-only items are useless and only serve to confuse.WORTH: This game needs a major sale for it to be worthwhile, as it was technically released in 2006, and then again on iOS in 2011.OVERALL: There are occasional frustrations but overall, this has been pleasant. I don't think it'd be my first choice for experiencing FFIII, but I enjoyed it nontheless.SCORE:6/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												I've been a Final Fantasy buff for nearly 2 decades and 3 was one of those elusive games I never got to play due to the original never making its way to the West.  Thankfully this has been changed and the game got a nice faithful remake.  All I can say is WOW - I do not know how this game avoided a Western release the first time around, it was fantastic. All the making of a traditional FF world (4 Crystals, Warriors of Light, etc. etc.) - and with enough flair and uniqueness to quite distinguish it from basically every other FF game even into modern iterations (I really liked the idea of '2 worlds' one being a floating continent).The Job system is awesome and offers a huge variety of choices but does promote some serious grinding if you're into switching around.  If you don't like to grind then chances are you will finish the game with the default classes (Warrior et al.)Probably the biggest downside to the game is that it features the archaic 'only 3 spells per level' mechanism that existed in FF1 and 2 - this is further aggitated by the fact that the game is no longer limited to simply White and Black Magic - you also have to find room to put your Summons in one of those 3 precious slots per level.  However I can understand that the game is technically just a faithful remake, and the system is what it was when 3 released in Japan.Storywise this really feels like an early FF - and by that I mean the story is trivial at best (same as I and II).  You could text mash the whole game and you'd likely find you like it just the same as long as you like FF/JRPGs.  That being said - it's not an issue of the story being ""bad"" so much as the story just didn't latch for me.Graphically it isn't too bad - it stands somewhere around where 7 does graphically.  7 makes use of parallax backgrounds and imaging layers to give the impression of better 'graphics' for their environments - but when you look at the character models you can see the difference - especially in meshing.   FF7 has better environments, but FF3's character models' meshes and overall 3D details are better - textures are bit poop, but still better than FF7s in most cases.  All in all it was a positive experience and one day I'll probably play again just for the fun of it.			"

												Well.. What should I say after having cleared the game? The story is well worth to be played and this game is a worth member of the Final Fantasy family. However, it should be contextualized in the years it was produced. If you play this game with the eyes of a 80s-90s guy, you can only be amazed and positively surprised by the gameplay, the amazing storyline and the vastness of the world you will travel within, as well as the beasts you will encounter. The remake in 3D graphics maybe is not really nostalgic, but it makes the game experience far more enjoyable than in the past on NES and DS.If you play this game with the eyes of a 2000s guy, you will be pretty disappointed: repetitive battle system, too broad job system (some jobs are completely useless, for example I'm really wondering whether anybody has ever used the job Ranger...), too many restrictions on weapons (for example, there is a job, I don't remember which, that can use basic bows and arrows at the beginning, but cannot use the advanced version of both.. Just why??), some almost impossible achievements (if you miss to open a chest or you miss to fight an enemy in some areas which you cannot get in later on, you have missed the achievements, unless you start the game from zero again and pay more attention...).I am a mixture of both kind of players, nostalgic but not refraining some criticism. My final comment and impression is more than positive anyway, because I'm a huge fun of FF Saga of all eras, and because overall is a very light game which doesn't requere too much effort and time to be played well.Highly recommended to the historical fans of FF Saga, but good also to approach the JRPG world in a basic and friendly way.

												Final Fantasy III is a nice JRPG but definitely shows its age. This PC port is based on the Nintendo DS-Version from 2006 which itself is a port of the original NES game from 1990. The graphics are done in a reduced chibi-style that may not be everybody's cup of tea, but all models are surprisingly faithful to the original. Pro: - The barebone story is somewhat extended compared to the original- The job system is pretty flexible and allows for some experimentation.- Even without a real help box like in the FF6 remake you always know where to go next- ~20+h of playtime without doing the superbossCon:- Formulaic ""Go rescue the world"" story- Turn based combat with a large random element to the speed stat. This can lead to some bad luck in boss combats which otherwise would be pretty easy - Weird difficulty progression: Some bosses in the mid game are much more difficult than the enemies in the surrounding area would suggest- No save points in dungeons. The final dungeon takes over an hour to complete. If you die on the final boss you can repeat everything- Itemization of some classes is strange. My black and white mage wore their starting head gear up to the last part of the final dungeon- Changing job classes takes a looooot of grinding and some jobs become available really late. I ended up with just changing the job of 1 character to an advanced job class and still could finish the game without much problem.Despite some of the shortcomings, FF III is enjoyable enough for an in its core 26 year old game. If you want to experience the evolution of the Final Fantasy games this is a good starting point that already has some of the elements and comfort found in later games, but is still charmingly unpolished.

												I had, prior to this game, finished ff4,6,7,8,9,10,12 and  13 but never tried ff3- now I´ve not only played but also finished ff3 and yes, I do recommend this game.final fantasy 3 is more of an old-school game (...what a shocker?!) than the newer games, in terms of jobs and dungeons. While there is a story within this game, and its a decent one, the playable characters are hardly the focus, but more about dungeon exploration and saving the world.While that might sound bad, it was actually a pleasent experience somewhat, since there are so many classes to try and experiment with for the ""right"" combination to beat bosses and dungeons and advance in the storyline. For example, if you feel a dungeon might have too many locked door, maybe you should bring a thief for that extra treasure. If you experience to have a dungeon filled with monsters weak to magic you want to bring a black mage, and if you feel the need for a good tank to absorb all that physical damage and dish some of that back you may need a viking or a knight.Also, the game doesnt hold your hand, they want you to figure out stuff and explore on your own.Anyway, it had a good strategical depth and for any rpg lover it would satisify but if you´re looking for a good story with great characters, and looking among the older rpg titles, Final Fantasy IV(4) will be a much better choice.I will still grant this game 8.0/10			"

												Good game if you're looking for a break from the usual rpg experience, taking a step back into an old pair of shoes. Really enjoyed the fact that anyone can be any class, and tons of choices. My opinion is a bit biased I'll admit, hard for a Final Fantasy game to disappoint me but this one exceeded my expectations. Pros--Funny storyline-Unlimited party options for combat(Example:White Mage/White Mage/White Mage)-Decent length of game time, 20 hours in and only felt like I was half-way throughCons--Story can be difficult to follow at times, gotta pay attention to what the NPCs tell you-Classes level individually, and some have upgrades as you level, like Monk<Master. But by the time you unlock Master, your Monk at his current level will be doing more damage than a Level 1 Master.If I had to give it a score, I'd say 7.5/10Hope you found this review helpful, first one I've written!

GOODAs a avid Square fan since FF7 and onwards, visiting this remastered old relic for the first time enlightened me on the foundations of the SquareSoft's (now SquareEnix) gaming mechanics. This game is certainly a remaster of history. Compared to the original Nintendo release, this game is colorful and more welcoming to the new generation of gamers who are interested in classical RPG.This is a must play for those that loved FF9 and the Final Fantasy MMORPGs 11 & 14. From the combat system, job growth system, monster lore, and music. This experience helped me understand how these foundations contributed to success of these future (now vintage) titles.BAD?Do keep in mind, as a classical RPG, the grind will be very real. The implemation of the Achievement system here on Steam is a good way to indicate your full completion of the game. So those that have played before  on a console may have something to go for completing the game again. If 100% is not your goal, you can blow through a regular playthrough at 25+ hours.			"

												I loved this game on the DS, so I bought it again here.  I highly recommend it if you're a fan of old school JRPGs with random encounters and turn-based battles.The story is simple, but you have to remember that this is a remake of a game from 1990.  For me, a big part of the appeal is the character customization.  There are dozens of ""jobs"" (character classes) which you can switch to at any time once you've unlocked them.  Even though the story proceeds in a linear fashion, the character customization gives you a lot of freedom to do what you want - so you have nonlinear choices in that regard.The DS version had very low resolution graphics, and it's refreshing to play on a big screen with sharp visuals.  After playing this, I don't think I can go back to the DS version.  Keep in mind that these are still the original low-polygon models.  Personally, I find the low-polygon look to be charming, but some people might not like it.I've played a lot of games including many RPGs, and this has possibly the best soundtrack I've ever heard in a game.  Yes, even when comparing it to other great soundtracks like Chrono Trigger/Cross and other Final Fantasy games.  The remade FF3 soundtrack is that good.  I recommend headphones to get the full experience.			"

Final Fantasy 3 ReviewThe Final Fantasy 3 version in steam is the great resurrection of an old title, The graphics while cartoony are cute and good, the gameplay is tight, the story is great for newcomers and nostalgia returnees alike. Some pros would be:  The gameplay is great. The fighting and menu engine seem polished and I had no issue with it.  The story itself is fairly good.  The job system is an interesting mechanic that will keep you entretained for hours.  Great soundtrack.  Very interesting gameplay mechanicsSome cons I found while playing:  Some textures are clearly low quality and wouldn't have taken much effort to remake for the PC, for example the white circle that approaches the characters at the start of a battle would've taken seconds to implement.   The game doesn't seem to be fully optimized for PC, some lag did occur during my playtime. It got particularily bad while grinding, but nothing game breaking.Overall, I'd love if this release had been better polished before release. That did not in any way shape or form stop me from playing 95 hours of it so far, hitting level 99, hitting several job level 99 among others. For its price it feels like an excelent value proposition and despite its problems I would still highly recommend it.			"

												Fun and simple RPG. Recommended for old school gamers. There really isn't much character development. When a character dies, you don't really care, because you only really encountered them for like a day or something. Haven't encountered any glitches. The game worked fine using a controller. Can be a little annoying, because the developer didn't bother converting the controls with an Xbox Controller in mind. When an instruction appears, it's for the mouse and keyboard, but isn't hard to figure out which button doesn't what on a controller.			"

												I haven't played the original NES game beyond the first dungeon, and now I know what I've missed. It is an amazing game with great mechanics, albeit not having great character depth and development, something to be seen for the first time in FFIV. It is the first FF game that allows your characters to change jobs freely, something that would come back again in FFV and FFT. Probably the best of the first 3 games (but, still, behind the SNES titles). If you like old-school JRPGs, this is a must have.Note: Not a single bug found in my ~56h of gameplay (Windows 8.1, 16GB RAM, Intel CPU, AMD GPU).			"

												This game is very brutal for a Final Fantasy game.-There are no ethers in the game and the only way to heal MP is to either rest in a town or use an elixer.-Elixers are very rare-Phoenix Downs are rare and can not be bought.-There are no save points inside dungeons.-Protective magics are single cast only.For this being a remake of an snes game it is actually pretty good.Some of the jobs like thief and scholar are pointless and there special skills can be replaced by items or spells.The thiefs steal is useless unless you want to farm phoenix downs from a rare mob because there is only one thing you can steal that cant be obtained any other way and its at the end of the game. Stealing from any other mob or boss only grants basic shop items.The game is worth a play through if you are a fan of FF games otherwise im sure there are some newer turn based RPGs you can find that do what this does and better.This would be a neutral review if i could have that option.

												This was my second time playing through Finaly Fantasy 3, the first time was on my 3DS a few years back.  I can't remember a big change on the PC but I really enjoyed my time with this game.  For me it was not my favorite of all the FF games I have played, not to say it was bad but the story was bland and lacked very little emotion.  This was mostly due to the age of the game.  The remakes on PC/3DS have noticeable differences in graphics and overall gameplay/game length, this helps with replaying it for the most part.  When it comes to optional quests, gear, dungeons, etc.., there is not much to talk about.  With the exception of one side quest most endgame content will be completed on a casual playtrough.All in all I liked the game and would recommend it to anyone thats in to oldschool JRPG games.  I'm also glad I played before replaying 4, 7, and 8 because you get a better experience seeing the evolution of the series and how it continues to hold to certain fan fare and oldschool game mechanics.

												As a huge FF fan this might be my least favorite in the series.It was hard to get too involved in the story and not much ""feel"" in the characters you play or meet.The Job system and the way you level them seems off to me. Normally I like to powerlevel, max out my chars, but in this system you have to stay in combat and do alot of combat orders to gain JE (jobexp, which are hidden).The MP system is weird too, granting you a specific amount of casts pr. spell level, instead of just normal mana. Not a fan of that, 95% of the time my spellcasters were just ""guarding"" to avoid wasting spells.Despite all of this, I would recommend the game to any FF fan.			"

												If you are a Final Fantasy Fan, this game is a must have. if you loved Teranigma and other Snes RPG`s you will loves this game too. For 12,99€ is not much for this Game, you have a lot of play time and it makes a lot of fun. Final Fantasy 3 is also available with a lot of languages, so you also can play it in French, Italian, German and Spanish if you can`t english. I`m playing this Game with Controller, and it works very nice, no bugs, good controlls and easy to handle in the menu. Pressing RB show you the Map, where you can see towns you visited, I also recommend to save as much as you can, you never know if you survive :)Pro:Old School Graphic with a new styleController works very goodVery long game playa lot of fightsdifferent bossesdifferent enemieshard battles (wrong level or boss fight)you can choose between 7 jobsmultilanguageContra:you cant skip after won a battle (after 100+ fight its anoying)save only on the mapAnother contra is quick save don`t remember where you startet, so if you die because you forgot that you didn`t saved you have to play from your last save again, if you used ""quick save"" a few times and never saved on map its boring because you have to do all again ^^ I know that the game warn you but after playing a few hours or fighting agains enemies who are very easy you think you can win all fights and then ..♥♥♥♥♥♥happends you die ^^I rate this game 9 of 10 Points			"

												Final Fantasy III, a brilliant remake to hit Steam. I played the crap out of this game when it arrived for Nintendo DS. In this adventure you play as the four warriors of light, who ironically are all orphans, to stop the evil darkness threatening your world. With access to a wide range of jobs, party combinations feel limitless. Each character also provides their feedback the further you progress.Pros:- Jobs and lots of them. Be whatever you want whenever you want.- The story is engaging as most Final Fantasy games.- Open world, advance when you want or go explore at your own risk.- Great music for a dated game.- There is an achievement to get all characters to level 99 and max all jobs. Long playtime alone to obtain this goal.- Easy to gear up and each job armor displayed is fitting.Cons:- Though the amount of jobs is great, the remake of this game could have included more job related skills.- At times if you forgot where you needed to go to advance the story, you are kind of SoL.- Game feels too easy, but maybe I'm just that good! -cough-- Grinding levels will get boring. I always thought it wouldn't, but it will. Especially after I played so much of this on the Nintendo DS.- Is there really a point to the chocobos in this game? Grinding is needed so why bypass it?Those are just my nit picks. I love this game and the enjoyment it brought me years ago. Following the story is interesting enough and the dialogue doesn't drag on. You get your permanent party members extremely early so keeping them leveled close to each other is simple.  I recommend this game if you haven't yet burned your eyes out playing it in the past!			"

												As a huge FF fan this might be my least favorite in the series.It was hard to get too involved in the story and not much ""feel"" in the characters you play or meet.The Job system and the way you level them seems off to me. Normally I like to powerlevel, max out my chars, but in this system you have to stay in combat and do alot of combat orders to gain JE (jobexp, which are hidden).The MP system is weird too, granting you a specific amount of casts pr. spell level, instead of just normal mana. Not a fan of that, 95% of the time my spellcasters were just ""guarding"" to avoid wasting spells.Despite all of this, I would recommend the game to any FF fan.			"

												If you enjoy turn-based RPGs then this is a must play.I'll admit the game has a difficulty curve to it, but there's nothing like a little bit of grinding to sort it out, just in case though make sure to SAVE OFTEN!The way the job system plays out makes you care for your individual characters because depending on how you build them, if one key player falls, the rest follow. Perhaps best of all, there are many play styles and builds for this game, and no two work the same (I played devout, summoner, knight, and geomancer) which doesn't add much to replay-ability, but allows you to play your way and perhaps a different way in the future.I'm a huge fan of the final fantasy series and definitely reccomend any wary buyer to try this game out! (Just don't forget to save often, the game is HARD!)			"

												If you want a classic Final Fantasy adventure - look no further. The plot is simple but always moving, the job system is not as good as in later entries but still offers a fair share of variety for your team. And as the game constantly throws different challenges - experimenting with party combinations is key. The music is beautiful and has some of my favourite tunes in all of the series (like Boss Battle and Crystal Tower's theme). Graphics are very simple, but all models are clear, and there is never any confusion on the screen, as to where to go and who to hit. So overall presentation is charming. Overall - I like FFIII a lot, but the last dungeon and boss ruin it a bit for me. It's not that they are hard or anything, but there are no save points. It takes about an hour (depending on your party's power) if not more to go through Crystal Tower, Eureka and the Dark World. And all of that without a save point. Grinds my gears a lot, that. All in all, I definitely recommend it, but be warned that a simple Final Fantasy does not mean an easy one. With the wrong jobs you will die and die a lot. So make sure to look for treasure, level up, try new jobs and explore.			"

												My goal to 100% this game nearly achievable. If you did not know about the missable stuff such as chests and biestary entries then you will probebly end up doing 2 playthroughs. By the time you are done you will most likly have 150+ hours in the game. so far 72 and counting .... Anyways enough of that. This is a final fantasy game if you already know final fantasy then you will already know the core machanics of this game. It has the turn based battles, level system,job system ( which will drain your life away later... see achievement list)   also has  a world map to explore 3 of them in fact and towns to raid for treasure  *ahem* i mean talk to people and gather information. The dungeons in this game i found to be pretty straight forward some have basic paths while others later in the game will try to hide stuff via hidden passages.Unless you know your way around i may suggest using maps. ( Nes version maps are pretty accurate to use)  The story is pretty basic so do not expect anything exciting. 4 warriors of light gather. They go on a journey find the 4 fangs, go through evil barrier, kill the final boss. Granted there are some omg moments within the game. If you played ff2 then just know they followed up on what happens to people that join you  ...  Pc port quality is nothing to get hyped about you will be playing with black bars on the left and right side of your screen since this is not full 1920 by 1080. Which is a shame. But it should be no reason not to buy this game. It's good for what it is and should be played by all. pros .Follows on classic final fantasy methods of leveling .Job system is amazing .Lots of places to explore .Dungeons are not hard to navigate for newcomers cons.I would not reccomend this game to newcomers to the series maybe play 4 or 9 first .Lots of grinding for those achievements (which was honestly expected) .not full 1920by 1080 which is forgivable because the game is still playable  "

												After playing the Famicom version of this game, I was hesitant to give this remake a try.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how much of an improvement this game made over the original.  Rather than make an essay about the changes, I'll go point-by-point.+ Better graphics, obviously.  Granted, the Famicom version looked marvelous in the 8-bit era, but since this is a PC-optimized port of the DS game, I'm glad to see some 3D graphics in there.+ Better story.  The plot was a lot looser in the original, and the characters had no backstory at all.  By assigning default names to each character and expanding on their origins, the plot feels more cohesive and I connect with the characters better.+ Better use of the job system.  It's still not as crisp as Final Fantasy V, but the major gripe I had playing the Famicom version is that many job types became obsolete very quickly.  Some were never useful from the start, and the Scholar job was only necessary for one boss fight.  This remake changed all of that.  More jobs are useful for longer periods of time, and even in the late-game stages you can downgrade to a lesser job and still function well.+ Better difficulty curve.  The original game was HARD.  Frankly, without a strategy guide, beating that game would have been near impossible.  But the remake softens the blow a lot and makes the game much more enjoyable.  You never feel like you're bringing the game to a screeching halt so that you can grind job levels or character levels.  It flows much more smoothly.Overall, this game was in dire need of a remake, and this one does the job quite well.  If you've never played Final Fantasy III, or if the Famicom version left a bad taste in your mouth, then I strongly recommend picking this up.  You'll be glad you did.			"

												Before starting, I must state (because it seems many do not know this still) this is **NOT** the FFIII that was on the SNES (that was FFVI in Japan). FFIII was never released in NA until a few years back, when it was brough to the Nintendo DS & later Android (I assume iOS as well).This brings back the job system established in the first FF, with a large variety of jobs to choose from. These include the standard jobs you expect, like white/black/red mage, dark knight, dragoon; and others not commonly found in the FF series, such as viking, onion knight, and scholar. This also brings back a large world to explore, where you are not hand held and running down a hallway for 80 hours, which recent iterations of FF have unfortunatly de-evolved into.The graphics are bright, as to be expected of something ported from the DS. No, it has not been updated for the PC, but hey, it's not 8-bit graphics and high pitched MIDI sound killing your eardrums. Character design reminds me of a simple version of those seen in Bravely Default on the 3DS.I have never been able to get into mobile gaming (the drain on battery murders my phone), and am glad this came over to Steam. If you still need to add this one to your FF collection, and have not played it yet, pick it up as you will not be disapointed.			"

Remake of an old console classicThis game is a remake of the Final Fantasy III (which appeared 1990 for the NES). The remake was created for the Nintendo DS, and has some enhancements. I never had an NES, maybe it was just luck, because that way the game was quite crisp for me. I lost all confidence in consoles during the early 80s and the big console crash, since that time I exclusively use computers instead of consoles.The game has a lot of upgrades, as far as I remembered the NES game had graphics which could be compared to older RPGMaker games. This has been changed, also there is a lot more of actual interaction between the characters. And the Jobs (or Classes) have to be leveled seperately to the Skill Level. The game also has a lot of grinding, which is kind of a drawback in some times, but in this game grinding actually makes a lot of sense.Pros:Enhanced Graphics, Sound and Intro. The Intro alone is quite a show.The game was updated without destroying the charm of the original, including the different jobs.The game actually is very easy to learn and offers an intuitive access to the game world.Cons:Attention, to really and actually experience the game to it's fullest you have to grind a lot, the jobs require as much attention as the skill level and equipment itself.The story is a bit to shallow, but that's only a small drawback for the game.RecommendedThe game is good and worth it's money, it will bind you for quite some time and you'll be happy to get around a large gameworld with some strange stories and even stranger history. The Final Fantasy series always has been regarded as a hallmark of Roleplaying games, even back on the NES consoles. And yes, this notion is true, this game does a lot of stuff in a very correct and user friendly way, while at the same time it tries not to overdo some critical matters. The gameplay might be called linear, right - but you still can fail, and you might have to reload the save game.			"

												While it is a port of the DS remake, it has enough of the simplicity and that grindy flavor to hit the spot for that early Final Fantasy JRPG nostalgia (note: I've experienced no issues with the port).Much of this is owed to the fact that this game is almost a verbatim remake, which reflects the restrictions of the ancient technology of 1990, when the game was first released. The redsign of the game was primarily only a visual & audio makeover (updated music, '3D' environments & sprites, etc). The gameplay and construction are almost identical to the original.This means that there really isn't much at all to the story, and the characters are pretty much completely flat. So if you're expecting the rich development you'd find in the story and characters of the later installments in the series (pretty much any of them after this one), look elsewhere. Further, the maps used in the original games have been retained here - and that includes the limitations in design, as  So, similar to the limited story, dialogue, and characters, you'll find that they're disappointingly simple. While all the above might seem like a pile of complaints, it's actually not. What has been redone, has been redone well. The visuals are limited to that of a DS, however im finding that the music is really enjoyable. All in all, it's been a fun experience - just don't expect this to compare to the modern (high-budget) maserpieces that the Series produces. Bottom line: if you're looking for a nostalgic feel with a bit of modern flavor, this just might hit the spot.			"

												FF3 is a solid title and great to play on DS. Unfortunately, the steam release is a slap in the face.This game is riddled with game-breaking bugs. Story randomly resets and locks you, preventing progress. Essential story npc's and events are blocked or disappear randomly. Game functions, like job-change, suddenly don't work and prevent progression. Just from looking at the community forums, the developers are zero help in this, simply saying to save often and not addressing the issue of the bugs. I looked forward to a revisiting of a classic DS title, only to be severely disappointed by said issues.You're better off playing this on an emulator.			"

Pros:It's a classic.Great soundtrack.Port of the DS/Android version of FF3. I didn't run into any bugs in the 40+ hours I put into it.Gampad support.Neutral:Launcher. It's not a huge deal but I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't just integrate the settings into the game itself. If you want to alter things like resolution or game-pad configuration you'll need to close down your game and change it in the launcher.Lack of a simple tutorial. I'm all for games not holding your hand, but they don't even explain simple mechanics. It took me like 10 hours before I got frustrated enough to go and Google how to use spells on equipped weapons. (You have to press up while you're inside the item menu if you're wondering.)Achievements are outrageously grindy. I realize you don't need to do them, but getting all jobs on all characters to 99 is just insane.Cons:While some see a classic, others will see an outdated game. Combat is very simple, and the storyline is shallow and cliché.If your controller disconnects during play, you'll need to restart your game in order for it to work again.Lack of save points near the end of the game.

												This is a port of the DS version to PC and definitely one of the better Final Fantasy games out there. And it's all for one reason. CHALLENGE. Challenge. Yes, challenge. At various points in the game there are actually chances of being wiped. Phoenix Downs are in limited quantity. Dying means something. That factor alone makes the game far more enjoyable than  most of the other titles out there. The job system is really nice too. The game still manages to feel like an NES game with NES difficulty, but without terrible amounts of frustration. Saving is a lot more lenient than even the remake (alt+f4 will let you just go back to the last autosave; I don't think the DS version did that on reset). However, the end in particular can be extremely difficult. Be prepared!			"

												Considering the staying power this game has had and the wide recognition it has as a solid game, I'll just review the port quality.Square Enix has done a good job bringing these older FF titles to PC. The default keyboard controls are extremely responsive and easy to use. Every key is individually rebindable. The game itself runs flawlessly. Being a port of a 3DS game does not hold FFIII back, you get the definitive edition buying it on PC. But it's not without some issues. I would not come into this expecting good graphics settings or improved textures. It's mostly just copy/pasted from the 3DS version. If you can live with the dated visuals, it's still a very rich and deep FF game and a must play for any fan of the series.			"

												I like Final Fantasy. It's sort of like a virtual chicken nugget (I also like chicken nuggets). But I never really got to experience it's Golden Era as I was just a young little soul at the time (I wasn't actually even born yet). It's remakes like this that allow me to see what the first generation of Final Fantasy games were like. Heck, they were pretty good.I am fully aware that this is a port of the DS version, but it is still great to play some of the older games in this new console generation, as the current generation of FF games have not lived up to their expectations. Except A Realm Reborn. Damn that was good.Final Fantasy III was the only FF game that was not released in NA or Europe until the 2006 DS remake, and like said above this is esentially the same game. It was also the first FF game to introduce the Jobs system, a mechanic which allows you to choose and switch between different classes in-game, a system that has been used in many Final Fantasy games in the following years.Final Fantasy III is pretty much your standard Final Fantasy game. Magic chrystal, mystical bossfights, cliché characters and damn hard boss fights. I can see any fan of the series enjoying this game, but it's not something for new comers. If you want to get yourself into the FF universe, start off with FF VII - which is widely regarded as the best Final Fantasy game (not in my opinion, but hey)All in all, as a fan of the series I can say I have enjoyed the DS version and this PC port. I reccommend it to fans of the francise too.			"

												After 158 Hours I finally did it, I have the 100% on this awesome Game.40 Hours Story Time 10 Hours Monster Searching20 Hours Treasure Searching30 Hours Grinding to level 99 for the Iron Golem55 Hours Job Grinding to get everyone to level 993 Hours Credits, Restart after Death, AFK, etc.I really enjoyed the Game atleast till the moment of Grinding but if you just want to play the normal Story Mode its okay its really funny, in my opinion 1 of the best FF Titels out there.Different Jobs makes the Game very unique and really cool to play, after defeating every Boss (the Bosses are really hard sometimes) you feel satisfied because you realize your progress.The OST is good but after hearing it for about 100 Hours its kinda annoying like the Pokemon fighting theme after completing the game for the 5th time.The Story itself is kinda ""mainstream"" and nothing special, sadly not a FF 13.I can recommend the Game to everyone who loves Round-based fights. TY Steam and Square Enix for porting this awesome game to Steam :)			"

												Finally available for STEAM! It's not the same as the original though, it's the DS version as far as I can find though I never had a DS personally so I can't confirm.fun, classic, RPG goodness. The bonus? I can set my lap tops power savings to use under 10% max cpu and run the game off the intigrated graphics. Making it great for long trips without power. (Road trips/air plane travel) I haven't finished it yet but so far it's a solid port and even has ""quick save"" so you can set it down and go if need be.(For example, when my lap top is warning it will shut it's self off soon....)Happy this installment made it to PC, hopeing the rest of the games make it as well.

												If you are a fan of Final Fantasy like myself, I recommend getting this game.  Sure the graphics are not very impressive compared to today's titles, but if you like the old school rpg style, this is perfect for you.  There is a job system in this game, I think it is the first time in any Final Fantasy game this kind of thing appeared where you can switch jobs on the fly, and each one is strengthened the more you play it.Originally this game never saw the light of day here in the USA, it wasn't until recently when Square-Enix decided to remake it and release it for us that many of us could play it.  The storyline is simple to follow, but there are times you may need help figuring out where to go next, especially if you are looking for many of the game's ""hidden"" dungeons (hidden means not part of the main story in this case, if you look around though you can find these dungeons fairly easily)This game won't win any awards, but it is enjoyable to play overall, I recommend it for any fan of JRPG or Final Fantasy in general			"

												Plays like a NES game. It didn't age too well but that doesn't stop it from being one of my favourite in the series. On NES I like to use savestates but you don't really have that here. There's an exploit that's basically a rewind. If you pause, quit and restart the game mid-fight; you are put back right before the fight. mid-dungeon or anywhere. It doesn't matter where you are, it always works. With this exploit, I think everyone would be able to play it. It's just good ol' mindless fun, explore, fight, look cool and enjoy one of the classic Final Fantasies. (Though I still prefer NES version by far.)			"

												Great game with a classic Job system. The game uses the same 4 characters through the whole story with various support characters joining and leaving your party. Overall the game has the great story a Final Fantasy game would have and even some secrets to discover in the world. I would recomened Playing with a Controler becuase the Keyboard and mouse controls are a little Iffy, good luck.			"

												I decided to start buying the Final Fantasy games as i seen they have begun to come up on steam. there are a few titles that i have not yet played, Final Fantasy III being one of them. I was very impressed from the very beginning. It has a feel of being a mix between final fantasy tactics, and final fantasy VII. being able to switch jobs and customize your party has been very fun. That, plus the rich story and ability to roam an overworld like the Final Fantasy's of late have been lacking, makes for an awesome game.			"

An honestly good game worth playing, You'll see a lot of people ragging on the save glitches, but I never encountered any (I still reccomend saving often to multiple slots, just in case) Get this game if, like me you perferred the older final fantasy's to the newer ones.+Good story+Great, well excecuted job system+Pretty good battle system-(rare, but nonetheless present) save glitches -grinding for job levels is so boring I actually fell asleep-not much to do after killing the final boss			"

												This version somehow seems worse than the last one that I played.  Just lost literal hours to a shoddy save system and am having a very hard time contemplating redoing it.  Incredibly poorly balanced, featuring incredibly tedious basic enemies that will convince you you're drastically overlevelled and mysteriously godlike bosses who will end your run rather surprisingly.  If you expect me to drastically alter to my party solely to beat your story boss, I'm not playing your ♥♥♥♥ing game.  lrn2balance			"

												If you are a fan of RPGs or Final Fantasy, then this is one game that you need to try. The job system allows for some diverse play. The story is good and the graphics are alright for a remake / Port from DS. There are a few bugs which are only a problem if you are going for 100%. For example there is a bug where if you return the pendant from one sidequest before checking your post, you cannot get the post in order to get the Oricalcum (or however it is spelt). The downsides of this game is the possiblity of needing to consult a guide if you forgot what you need to do. Also leveling up jobs can be confusing but once you get used to it, it can be fun,			"

												The best way to play Final Fantasy III? The Nintendo DS remake.The next-best way to play Final Fantasy III? The PC port of the Android port of the DS remake--in other words: this.There are three facts you need to be aware of:1. Final Fantasy III, like most of the old Square and Enix games pre-dating their unfortunate merger, is an absolute classic.2. This game is a remake of Final Fantasy III. A true remake, not a port/update/remaster/whatever new marketing term people are using to pretend lazy ports are better than they are.3. But it's also a port, ya' know? And not a very good one. I'm not sure, but it may in fact simply be running the Android version remulated. Want the game to display 16:9 at 1080p? Sure, you can select that in the options menu--you can select lots of stuff--but no matter what you select, you get a letterboxed game screen. Want a smooth, 60fps framerate? Haha, no. Willing to settle for simply a smooth framerate? Sorry, but still no. The game is locked at 30fps and will frequently dip below that in combat. We're talking 24-28fps stuttering depending on how fancy the combat animation is.Final Fantasy III is a classic game, and that counts for a hell of a lot. And if you want to play the game on a big (at least relatively speaking) screen, the only ""legitimate"" (read: legal) way to do so is to buy this particular port. Otherwise the best option is the NDS original (the original remake, not the original NES game).			"

												This sure is Final Fantasy 3, firstly i want to talk about the port, this is a bare bones cheap and nasty port from the mobile version straight to the PC, no bells, no whistles, and considering that the android and iOS version is itself a port from the DS remake what we have here is some butt ugly textures and models being displayed at a high resolution that does them no courtesy, the sound is straight from the DS is is everything else, the game doesnt even fit to the proper aspect ratio, be prepared for 2 black bars to run vertically down the sides of your screen, there are barely any options to toggle this game has trading cards and controller support and that is literally about it, not enough to justify the price for anyone familiar with FF3The first three Final Fantasy games are very easy to group together, they are easilly the worst the franchise (with the exception of 13 and its iterations) but they are still important games that made mistakes that would only surface themselves through time. 3 has a class system in place that anyone familiar with 5 or 14 should feel comfortable with, you can select Jobs and level them individually as well as level your own characters base stats. 5 handles this better but this is the first FF game to bring in the system, personally id argue 3's biggest flaws are the same as FF1 and FF2's flaws but on a larger scale, Heavy grinding, vague story and a large overworld easy to get lost in, this to some people sounds like hell while to others it probably sounds great, this is an NES era RPG and this port doesnt do much to change that for better or for worse. its still a cracking game albeit one i feel that has aged the least well, with a very large difficulty curve (that frog tower...oh my god) that is showing its age. If your already familiar with FF3 and merely looking to see what this PC port brings to the table, i cant recommend that the price is worth your time, equally if your looking for a decent JRPG on the PC, the poor port quality and how harsh and aged this game really is means that i cant recommend this over say child of light or Recettear.However if you are intruiged to see what FF3 brings to the table on its own, and dont have access to the mobile ports (which could likely be found cheaper for the exact same content) and the sounds of a tough as nails old school JRPG sound good to you, then id recommend jumping in, maybe during a sale, theres just no reason this game should cost this much, 50% off though and id say go for it,			"

												I'm a bit biased since Final Fantasy is my favorite series, but this one is special. It was the first of the series to introduce the jobs attribute, letting you play with different classes throughout the game and planning them to fit your strategy. The story isn't as enthralling as the more popular FF titles but still good.Replay value is fair, I tend to replay every FF title every five years or so, so you can play it again and still love it. However the limited saving in this one tends to cause frustration.			"

												Nice much needed remake of Final Fantasy 3.Not my favorite Final Fantasy, of the ones I have beaten(1-10 and 12)... I would say 9, 12, 6, 10, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 8, 1 is the order I rank them.It should be noted that the game is a LITTLE buggy, it doesn't remember your preferred rendering settings.  If you unplug your controller in the middle of the game, you have to shut it down and start it back up again or else it can't find it.  The window sizes do not match the render resolutions.  The game would ocasionally go crazy with my controller and scroll like crazy(as if I was holding down the d-pad or analog stick in one direction); I would have to jiggle the analog stick to get it to stop; It is not my controller, it is definitely the game.  Other than that, it plays fine without any real problems.But there is no such thing as a bad Final Fantasy game and even FF1 is a pretty good game.The thing that really strikes me about this one is that there are no ethers.I haven't played played the NES version of this game, so I cannot really give a good comparison, but I would imagine that it is way better than the original.  Adding the Onion class was a nice touch, it really made the job system useless though; this is because the onion class can perform all magic except summoning and can equip all weapons and armor(except for that of the level 99 special weapons/armor that are made for specific jobs).  Using the onion class, I was able to beat the game at level 62 in 38 hours(which might not be accurate seeing as some times I paused the game and walked away from it).I really did enjoy it, can't wait to play FF13 and FF15(not a big fan of monthly subscriptions required to play FF11 and FF14, so I will probably skip those)			"

Oh my Gosh...Ohhh my gosh...More Final Fantasy on PC, finally, finally!My review's a bit late, so what? It's highly doubtful if you're looking at this that you're not familiar with the Final Fantasy series. The fact that Square-Enix has decided to start bringing them back to PC over the year and a half or so is definitely welcome. Major Criticisms?I have none. I'm not going to nitpick about the graphic quality, or anything like that. Apparently this is a port from the Nintendo DS version of the game? Who cares? I would be happy if it had the same graphics as the original version, as long as it's on PC and I can obtain it easily. I do have a minor gripe, which is just that the animations aren't that smooth during battles and things like that, but the graphical quality hits around that of PS1/N64-era gaming, so I'm okay with that. After all, it's the Final-friggin-Fantasy III reboot, and I don't own a DS, so I'm pleased as punch...(So to speak.) OverallI'm giving this a 10/10, because it's a Final Fantasy game. Everything about it is grape, aside from my minor gripe, and I'm not going to deduct points for that. I just hope that Square-Enix keeps these coming, because I would love to see Final Fantasy 9, 10, and 12 get thrown onto PC. I understand why they're doing them in the order that they are, and it's largely due to ease of porting each game from their respective consoles to PC. Again, 10/10 - No major complaints. More, please.			"

												Turn-based RPG, before the days of the active time battle, there were the originals, this is a remake of Final Fantasy III originally released exclusively in Japan for the ""Family Computer"" ... That's how old the mechanics/storyline are. HOWEVER, there have been quite a few tweaks made to bring it up to date with what you would expect of a good RPG ... In the 90's. As far as storyline goes, it's pretty bland and generic. Collect the crystals, beat the bad guys, save the world. It does have some hidden humorous elements in it, but they're few and far between. This game is badly dated, but it's still a solid essential for a Final Fantasy fan, and it is enjoyable up to about level 40, when the grind from 40-60 begins, it will take you about three hours on a good day, and you pretty much need to be 60 to beat the game. DO NOT go into this game thinking you will 100% every aspect of it, and if you do, for the sake of sanity, make sure you kill every sea creature while you still have your sea boat, or you'll be SOL for getting that beastiary achievement. You will not want to replay this game. Sad but true, it's just not that immersing compared to later Final Fantasy games.There are no voiceovers as seen in FFIV, there are summons, which are cool.TL;DRGrindfest, random-battle hell, old-school level up, good world maps, sometimes even surprising, bosses are not overly frustrating (There is no boss in this game that will one-shot your entire party* like later Final Fantasy games), bland storyline, decent graphics, decent amount of secrets. Overall a B- as far as RPGs are considered. There just isn't much to this game to compare with newer titles.*There is a boss that will one shot your party, but it is meant to happen, there is no way out of it, don't freak when it does happen.

												TLDR : Buy this game if you wanna deep dive in an old-school rpg.If you like the old-school turn based combat system you won't be disappointed with this one.The game itself offers a lot of variation in terms of playstyle in combat, as there's over 20 jobs any character can have that are unlocked while you progress throught the game, but as long as you don't swap those around too much you won't need to grind at all to complete the main story. The only thing that requires real grinding is the secret boss, but that's pretty much to be expected. That said i personally found the game quite easy, except for the last dungeon which ends up being quite interesting. Also beware that while it has an awesome soundtrack, there is no real deep story, no voice actors and the graphic is quite old. So in the end i really recommend this if you know what you are buying, as it's one of those games that ain't really for anyone.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy franchise, and having played this game on the DS I was really looking forward to some casual fun on my PC.The game has a good combat system, nice music, and the visuals are pretty decent if you walk in with the expectation of first-gen DS hardware rendered ones. It's basically a Final Fantasy game worthy of the name in regards to aestethics.Unfortuantely the game appears to have some major bugs that resets your game progress, locking you to areas or forcing you to retrace steps depending on when the game resets. Bugs which have been around for some time judging by the forums without any resolution.With these bugs in mind, I'm afraid I can't recommend this game to others, anyone unfamiliar with the games might get the wrong impression, and anyone familiar with them will most definitely go on a rage fest over losing their progress over and over.

												Considering this was ported from the Nintendo DS, the graphics have aged very well. Unfortunately at the higher resolutions, you start to see the seams in the presentation, especially if you zoom in on specific areas. Pots and other objects in the area are obviously flat sprites and the low poly models can be a little odd at times, especially in the odd texture glitch, which is rare and not as noticable as it sounds.The gameplay is about as NES hard as it ever was, so prepared to either die a lot or grab a strategy guide to help you through, because this game is not for beginners.All in all, this is a great game, and I'm glad it got a PC port.

Chests started respawning so I could pick up double of some items (Could have even more if I opened the chests again), and I can't change jobs. Would love to finish this game but it's unplayable like this.			"

												My very first experience with Final Fantasy. I didn't know when I first picked it up that it was considered one of the more difficult additions to the series... But boy oh boy did I figure it out. It's clearly not impossible... Just not a cake walk either. This game was my gateway to the entire Final Fantasy universe. This game made me love all forms of RPG in a video game format. I reccomend FFIII to any and all types of gamers. Newbies to Advanced. The story alone makes it worth the effort and money. BUY THIS GAME NOW.			"

												This is a great remake with the feel of the original. If you are looking for an easy RPG, this is not the one you want. There are many boss's that require grinding. If you are not into grinding levels, don't play this game. I for one love the new look with the old school feel. The only complaint I have is the lack of any cap in the Job system. In Final Fantasy V you could max out your jobs. In this game, they just keep going and going. It's hard to tell when to stop leveling a certain job.			"

												So when you purchase something with the name ""Final Fantasy"" no matter the number that follows the name, you get a great soundtrack, an even greater storyline, characters that you will still remember 10 years from now and lots of fun. Blind purchase for any J/RPG fan. As for FF3 in particular, well it has been tested long ago and was proved to be a masterpiece :)Totally recommend it!			"

												If you enjoy Final Fantasy for it's game play and job system then this is the game for you. It's the first of it's kind, Final Fantasy 5 being the ""other one"" and Final Fantasy X-2 being the ""other, other one"" but let's not taint this review with talks of that new age garbage.The game is simple, it's fun, has an in game map so you can't really get lost and was completely dumbed down from it's NES counterpart so just about anyone can finish it... including small rodents.Music is decent... only a couple tracks really stand out, it's not Nobou's best work but it was his early stuff... Final Fantasy IV and VI made up for it...Again, if you hate job systems and grinding, stay away from this game. I prefer Final Fantasy V over this entry because it had a much better plot and the job system had evolved by that point so you could mix job abilities but it's still fun to change your characters appearance and play dress up... keeps it fresh.

												I wish there was another option besides ""recommended"" and ""not recommended,"" because I'd give this game a ""meh"" if I could. I don't hate it, I just think it's the weakest of the first five Final Fantasy games--and the 3D remake doesn't really improve anything.Aesthetically, I liked the chibi/Mii/MySims-looking character models more than I thought I would. Your main characters are all adorable, and the costumes for all the different classes are fairly detailed and interesting (though they look better in the menu thumbnails). But the character models are also really twitchy during battle sequences.In general, I'm a big fan of the art style used for the Game Boy Advance remakes of these games. The smaller, more realistic sprites did a good job of capturing the dark, intricate, fantastical feel of the classical Final Fantasy universes. Look at the concept art from FFI-V. It's all weird, exotic, and unearthly, and I think the GBA remakes did a much better job capturing that feel with their overall designs. This game, however, goes for a more generic, cartoony atmosphere as part of an appeal to younger and more casual gamers. The backgrounds to the battle sequences are the only truly appealing visual element in the game. Environments look empty and bland, both in the overworld and in towns and dungeons. Enemy models lack detail and also come across as bland. One of the advantages of the hand-drawn sprites from the GBA games is that they portray each enemy in a carefully designed, static pose, so each enemy gets to look pretty cool. In a 3D game, you see the whole enemy, and the enemy moves around even when it isn't attacking, so most enemy models come across as lackluster or unimpressive.The transition to 3D also changes the way your character moves in the game. Instead of moving tile-by-tile, you have free range of movement--which means your character will get stuck on corners a lot. Furthermore, the near walls in every dungeon consist entirely of empty shadows, and it be difficult to see certain doors and entrances as a result (although hidden passages are usually grossly obvious). I imagine I would enjoy this game more if I played it on the DS. The default keyboard controls are about as unintuitive as possible, and you can only change the controls on the start-up menu before you actually launch the game. A GBA remake would have been even better, I think, but I still think I would consider it my least favorite original Final Fantasy game.For one thing, while the game has a fine story, the pacing and exposition are weird. You often have to extrapolate beyond what characters say if you want to have any clue what's actually going on. Usually, a FF game's story is easy to follow despite its many twists and turns, but this game has you holding on for dear life in terms of comprehension. One problem is that the game is a little too open-ended at points. You can often start down several storylines by visiting different towns, but you may have to wait for a few dungeons and crucial plot developments before these storylines ever feature into the central plot. The game allows for a lot of exploration, which is fun in its own right, but there aren't always worthwhile rewards to finding new areas before you're ""supposed"" to.Also, the game has a frustrating tendency to almost require you to switch jobs in certain ways at certain places. For instance, the game features multiple (multiple!) dungeons that require you to traverse them under the effects of the spell Mini--which essentially makes all your physical fighters useless. Other sections of the game clearly push you toward   classes like the dragoon or the dark knight by giving you loads of specialized equipment in anticipation of a boss battle or an enemy type that will be hard to deal with otherwise. These gameplay designs would make for excellent teaching tools--if this my first time playing a game with an involved job system. It's not. These sections also hurts the game's replay value, since even experienced players don't always have total freedom to experiment with the different job classes and set up the party they want to use. In fact, the job system in this game is kind of a letdown. One problem with being able to change characters' jobs at will is keeping track of all their equipment. While there is a fair amount of overlap in terms of which jobs can use what weapons and armors, carrying around or storing all that junk gets annoying after a while. And while most jobs progress pretty quickly, there isn't too much incentive to gain job levels with most classes. At most, a higher job level changes one or two minor calculations for class-specific actions you won't always use all that often. Job level is more important for mages, since I'm pretty sure it influences the MP they gain. Unlike the job system in, say, FFV, there are no major rewards for mastering a class either. You can't take abilities or even base stats (except HP) with you when you change classes. But I think my biggest gripe about this game is its horrendously uneven gameplay. This game expects you to grind for several levels between just about every major dungeon. Try to go straight from one plot point to the next and you will probably lose. The boss battles are the worst offenders of all--they are all really, really hard. Regardless of how easily you managed to get through a dungeon's standard enemies, when you reach the boss, there is a good chance you will get a game over. And with no mid-dungeon save points, that means replaying an entire chunk of the game. Each boss is exactly the same too--they all attack twice with either hard physical attacks (that can inflict statuses) or magic spells that hit your entire party for heavy damage. The challenge doesn't come from figuring out an optimal strategy; it comes entirely from luck, as bosses have an unusual tendency to target your weakest characters and throw you back on your heels in survival mode. The game gets better as it goes along, fortunately, and the vast job system does provide a lot of replay value. I'm just pretty sure I would rather replay Final Fantasy I on the GBA than fight through this game again--what with all its problems and its decided lack of polish.			"

												FFIII is as evil as it is captivating. While the story suffers from a few hiccups now and then, it never feels dull or grey. This remake takes you back to a time when games were challenging, testing the skill of the player, not just giving them consquence-less respawns. Example; Modern Game: ""Last boss of the dungeon! *Dies* *Respawns at entrance to boss*""FFIII: ""Last boss of the dungeon! *Dies* ...wait...WAIT....WHAT!? I Haven't saved in hours!"" This level of difficulty is shunned by most, but beloved by the rest. Games have not ""Advanced"". Have you noticed 95% of NEW games (2010+) are 89% cutscenes or QTE's? That's not gaming. That's proving that the gaming industry as a whole is dumbing their games down because of the apparent lack of motivation. FFIII is an example of how a game is meant to be, challenging yet rewarding. A game with a safe-fail system is in no regards challenging. It disappoints me to see the gaming companies flourish with so little effort put into their games (yes, you too Square). So please, if you want a REAL challenge, put your modern rpg away and pick this gem up.			"

												Final Fantasy 3 has joined Final Fantasy 7 and 8 on Steam, now keep in mind this is Final Fantasy 3 and not Final Fantasy 6 which was released in the US as 3(seems some people are still confused about that). This is also a port of the iOS/Android version which in turn was a port of the DS remake which took the orginal Famicom game and gave it a upgrade with a FMV intro, 3d graphics, though ps1/N64 level 3d graphics so expect some low poly models, revamped soundtrack and a reworked storyline which is still very light in narrative and a few other changes such as not starting the game with your full party and not having access to your first set of jobs till after the second dungeon. In the original you get your first set of jobs after beating the first boss in the intro/tutorial dungeon which makes the game a bit more harder when you reach the second dungeon. Now this game is fairly old school so expect to have to do quite a bit of grinding for exp. before tackling the next dungeon or else your going to have a bad time, seriously the next dungeon after the tutorial one is packed with hard hitting undead that will wipe the floor with your party. The game was the first in the series to make use of the ""Job"" system which means you pick what ""job"" each of your four charecters have and can change them for diffrent ones but unlike Final Fantasy 5 you really can't keep the skills learned from each job, so in other words you can have a charecter be a white mage and then become a ninja and still have access to white mage magic but you can move magic between charecters. But despite this, the light narrative, the grinding and the old school ""ask around to get clues on to what you may need to do next"" style of gameplay it's pretty fun if not hard. So if you can look past the low poly models and the old school RPG mechanics this is a worth while game but not for the asking price, maybe 9.99 or so sure but not at 14.99 so you may want to wait to see if it goes on sale and grab it then.

												There's a reason this is the forgotten FF, and it's not just because lack of a translation for decades.For those uninitiated to FF and JRPGs in general: Look elsewhere for your introduction, should you want one.For those more inclined, I point you to FFV first.For those who have played FFV, this is the same but less:  Little carries between jobs and switching is a nuisance, Boss AI is very limited (You pray they don't focus attacks on your healer and they can replace one of their attacks per turn with a spell, that's every boss for the entire game), there's no save points in dungeons, the plot is insultingly basic without even being enjoyably stupid, some jobs are direct upgrades others for no good reason, speed is very random in battles meaning healing is dangerously unreliable, the last dungeon is actually four dungeons and everything's so unmemorable that it's generally difficult to remember where you're going or why.There are some good points, some cool uses of Mini and Toad, the job costumes are good and there's a large variety of jobs, there's some depth (speed is random, but thief is fast enough that it probably doesn't matter), the story is lighthearted, the visuals are pretty good in the reboot and the music is catchy.  There's also a guy unironically named Goldor who lives in a golden house filled with golden monsters and fights you by beating you with the gold gauntlets on his gold armour, so that's worth something.Still, unless you've got to finish every FF, you can't get much more vanilla than this one.

The 2 major bugs I've come across is losing my story progress so that I have to restart it and the other is losing the ability to change jobs after going mini. In which to get back have to restart the game or have an earlyer save that hopefuly doesn't get bugged also. I see no point in trying to work around these issues to play a game.			"

Rewriting my review because FF3's purpose as a glorified petition is obsoletedLet's start off with the bad:When i first purchased the game, I couldn't help but notice my troubles with button mapping. Granted, i have only tested it with a Logitech 310 controller and have yet to test another controller as keyboard remapping for the most part works perfectly well.Although i'm personally not bothered by this (mostly because i only play this game when playing the Engineer in Team Fortress 2), Final Fantasy III shares the same framerate limits as its Nintendo DS release. Despite what the Steam store page suggests, the 3D visuals are hardly improved as most (if not all) the assets are taken from the DS version.Although this is more than a personal gripe than what i actually find bad about the game, I couldn't help but notice some need to grind when fighting the Djinn. Maybe it's cuz I haven't grown up with Nintendo consoles, so the nostalgia of an antiquated battle system doesn't really appeal to meWith all that said above, I personally don't think that Final Fantasy III is a bad game by any stretch of the word. Hell, for a game that's older than me, it's actually pretty good for something from the NES' lifespan. However, I can't recommend the game at its current price given that it didn't age all too well (Hell, i'd go as far as to call FFVII antiquated), so you're better off waiting for either a sale or a drop in the MSRP. (Considering that Square-Enix's faith in PC gaming has been secured, discounts are very likely)			"

												The biggest issue is this is a PC version that is just a port of the mobile version.. It looks horrible being played on a large screen. The UI is massive for no good reason. Feels as if the user should be using a touch screen instead of a controller. Also, the graphics are grainy and super pixelated. You can see the line between floor squares and the text has weird white and black strips between certain letters. Not worth your time, the Nintendo DS and NES versions are much better.			"

												In all this is a good Final Fantasy. For people that really like Default Bravery this is your OG (Kinda, the first too have similar class systems that built up into this one) In all I like the game and the story is nice, nothing amazing but it's good enough for an old RPG. My biggest problem with the game is infact the remake of the graphics. The low poly enemies look exetreme uninspired compared to the original pixel art counter parts. I'm all for Final Fantasy remakes but keep in mind a lot of the original draw for these games was in fact the artwork. It's a ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" situation. I like the fact that they updated it and made it 3D but to phone in the art design espically on the enemies and bosses is a real shame. However with that said I'm still happy to give this fanchies money for something I owned 20 years ago, a lot happier then I was when I played whatever you would call that garbage 13th installment I paid for.

												I'm near to the end of this game, and i think i'm ready to review it.I'd like to give this game a medium vote, instead of a poistiveo ne, but unfortunatly steam doesn't let you do that, but i still think this game it's more a positive than a negative game.Now, let's start with the PROs :-The jobs system is awesome, it really bring part of the combat system of FF II and fuse it with FF I's, in a really fun way-The graphics are okay, not great( it still looks like a DS game that doesn't utilize the full power of the console, and it makes      sense because it's the port of such thing), but it still looks nice, the chibi style is very good and gives a lot of atmosphere.-The soundtrack is amazing!-There's a lot of secondary content, which shows the improvement of the previous game( I'm talking more about the NES version, but i think you get the point)But here's the negatives: -This game is expensive for what it is, I think the correct price point is around 5-7$ ,so buy it only on sales.-Even if this game shows a lot improvement from FF I, the story of FF II  was so much better and interesting, it had more interesting charachter (except Guy) and much more interesting eventsI truly raccomend this game if you like old style rppg, but if you're new to the genre i think thatit will feel clunky and grindy			"

												Note: This is just a problem with the Steam port of this game.Although the experience is almost identical to the experience that you would receive playing this on iOS, there's a major problem with this port that iOS doesn't have. No matter where you are in the game, your story progress can be ultimately reset back to the starting town, Ur. You'll have to go through the whole story once again with three of the four characters going back to level 3/4. (Un)Fortunately, Luneth keeps his level, you keep all your items/spells, and all characters keep their job levels and current jobs. If you still wish to buy this game, or have already bought it and are reading reviews after buying a game, just be sure to save frequently, but save carefully. If at any time you notice that your job icon is unavailable, fall back to your last save. If the job icon can't be chosen, it means that your game has been set back to the beginning of the storyline. If you have a Nintendo DS or iOS device, or even a NES, I'd just recommend you buy it for that hardware to avoid this flaw.			"

												There's just something about old-school RPG's that really appeals to me, and Final Fantasy III perfectly captures whatever that may be. The game has wonderful visuals all around, and a nice difficulty. It's not easy, but it's not unbearable either. As soon as you get stuck, you just take a break, then go back and grind a few levels and you should be fine.Final Fantasy III saw the introduction of the job system, and there's a lot to choose from so you don't really get tired of your party. I think my only complaint is not having an airship for a pretty big length of the game, but the world is small enough that you don't really need it like you would in say Final Fantasy IV. This was a Famicom game after all.			"

												Short review. As a PC gamer I had never played FF games below 7 and never planned to. But this port changed my mind, but only for a few hours. While the battles do play out noticebly different from FF 7 to 9, the story leaves much to hope for. It all feels way too linear and predictable, perhaps due to low available memory on original platforms.Other than fulfilling achievements there is not much to strive a reward for. In the older games seeing the cinematics was one of those rewards. In this case, while the port gives extra cinematics, there is only the opening cinematic, which doesn't tell new players anything. It is as if Square Enix published this to the players of the original directly. That mistake makes me not recommend this game and question the ports of FF 5 and 6.			"

Wish I had read the forums a bit more, but hey a love of a game is a love right :D?Simply speaking no matter where you might lose progress and have to ""retrack"" from old save meaning if you are going to play keep multiple save of same game and make sure to rotate them and keep then far apart in the story. Else you might end up stuck with nowhere to go.They might fix it or not, but dont bother till you read that it have been fixed.			"

												I'm a Final Fantasy fan for sure.I never played FF-lll before thou, so i bought it. The idea behind job skills are really cool but difficult to figure out what jobs you want. Although, I beat the game I felt I could have had a stronger party. There is A LOT of areas in this game but they are poorly labelled, so dont forget where you have been. The steem achievements are nice to work towards and there are also those end game grinding ones which is nice touch. I did get lost at times and kinda cheated to figure out where to go to next. I bet the game no problem after grinding for a few hours. I peronall didnt enjoy this game but I could see the appeal of it.			"

												Final Fantasy III was initially a mystery to gamers outside of Japan, having only been released on the Famicom in 1990. Since then, Final Fantasy III has been re-released several times; Nintendo DS, Playstation Portable, Wii’s Virtual Console, iOS, Android, and most recently making its way here to Steam. The game’s format and mechanics may feel a bit dated/unusual to those familiar with newer Final Fantasy titles, but I believe that the game still provides a worthwhile playing experience.My first exposure to this game was the Nintendo DS version, which I picked up used for quite a bargain. That version is a 3D remake of the original Famicom game, and it appears that this PC version stayed loyal to that style. Due to the limited specifications on the Nintendo DS, I always felt that the game was a bit held back in the graphics and sound department. This PC version seems to have given the artwork better treatment, and appears to resemble the PSP version of the game more closely. I was concerned that the graphics would be overly pixelated due to the small resolution on handhelds, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the graphics felt right for PC.The music, as usual in Final Fantasy titles, is superb. As a remake, they stayed very true to the themes present on the Famicom release. Many of the musical themes fit the mood of the game quite well, allowing the player to enjoy a calm stroll through a town or a hectic boss battle at the end of a dungeon. The sound quality is superb, as well, and doesn’t have the muffled sounds that the DS version provided.Final Fantasy III’s combat system strays far from the system of its predecessor, and attempts to advance the system that was originally present in the original Final Fantasy. The player has the option to choose from a variety of jobs. As the player advances through the game and completes various quest “checkpoints” (for lack of a better word), additional jobs open up. Some of these jobs which offer a brand new range of healing, magic and utility, while some are simply upgrades to existing jobs. There are over two dozen jobs in total, giving players many chances to experiment. Along with jobs, this is the first Final Fantasy game to introduce summons. So if you’re familiar with summons in later titles such as Shiva and Bahamut, you’ll be right at home.An immersing story has been an important part of the Final Fantasy franchise in recent years. Going back in time, however, it wasn’t always this way. In Final Fantasy III, the story is notably flat compared to the extended stories present in modern RPG titles. It’s easy to understand, rarely sees plot twists, and has a relatively small cast of characters. It’s nothing spectacular, but it was a step ahead from the two previous entries in the series. Unlike the Famicom Final Fantasy III, however, the characters in this version are given formal names. Despite the limited storytelling, I still feel it’s pleasant; just don't go in expecting a 50 hour long legendary tale.The difficulty of this game is a bit jarring. The early game starts off quite bearable, giving players the ability to simply auto attack their way through many of the fiends. As the game progresses, the difficulty spikes up considerably. The final dungeons are notoriously difficult due to lack of save points and insufficient materials provided throughout the game. Compared to the difficulty of some modern Final Fantasy titles, the harsh difficulty in this game might turn some people away. But if you can fight through the barrage of random encounters and somehow make it through the dungeon, you’ll be rewarded with quite a sense of accomplishment.In conclusion, I feel that Final Fantasy III is a worthy purchase for those who wish to revisit the roots of the Final Fantasy franchise, and JRPGs in general. It’s difficult, but rewarding. A worthy game for the name “Final Fantasy.”			"

												I started playing final fantasy games about 10 years ago. I started with final fantasy X and was hooked shortly after. The series is amazing but I never went back to play anything below FFX. I heard the hype behind FFVII but I never like to buy into hype because it only serves to disappoint me usually. That being said, the very early final fantasys had sprites and I was not too interested in the low detail so I stayed on the other side of FFX.Now, I saw this on sale at the Humble Store and I figured it would be a good time to try the older Final Fantasy games, given the polish this game had recieved.It has a piece of gaming that I had missed with all the new games in the world now. It makes you want to play just because you want to discover new things. Not for the sake of driving the plot forward or saving X amount of people. It lets you do what you want and I get legitimately excited when I open a chest or find a new hidden area. It makes me feel like when I first started to play video games all so long ago and I haven't had this feeling since Valkyrie Profile:Leneth for the PSP. I actually want to grind and level my party up so I can kill monster and gain treasure. Almost a feeling akin to Skyrim but less open.I guess it plays to the basic nature that players want to get treasure and go adventuring. Not for someone else but to see a new world, take a break from reality, of only for a moment. This game gives me a feeling I sought for a while and makes me like to play with the jobs and test out different party combinations. Now, the game still has a linear story with areas opening up as you progress the role you are ""destined"" to fulfill but the game doesn't push that on you too hard. You know that you have to save the world or some such thing but it isn't the reason you are playing. Or at least why I am playing. It doesn't seem to be wanting to center itself around the plot. It seems to want to center itself around you doing what you wish the areas open to you leading up to the plot driven boss battle so you can continut the quest.In conclusion, it gives you the illusion of freedom even though it blocks you off at some points. The exploring of new caves and little hidden sparkles is fun. 10/10 would review again :D			"

Tried reloading, tried talking to the king again (Just reset all of my parties gear and levels to 3/3/4/4) nothing worked. Maybe other reviews talk about the problems, and they're all just as valid and common as they seem.			"

												I remember the times i played this on the ds when i was much younger it was a fantastic remake of the orginal final fantasy 3 that never really made it outside japan back in the old days this port feels just like the ds version in so many ways but still its a good game to buy if you dont allready own it on other platforms the adventure itself was short but great the grapics looked cartoonish but fit the theme nicely if your a fan of final fantasy games this is a good port 7/10			"

												Not a good port:-once you start the game without a controller, there's no way to use one without restarting the game. Same with controller timing out during gameplay.-missing psp auto battle feature-no graphical options to remove pixelation, aliasing, or banding such as texture filtering, msaa, or downsampling.PSP version remains the definitive version "

												Visuals - 3/10. The game is in 30 fps. Yes, this doesn't matter much for RPG's but it's really annoying to see the jerky battle animations at 30 fps.Sound/Music - 7/10. Average sound/music for a Final Fantasy game.Gameplay - 3/10. While the job system is nice (when it doesn't break, see below) it's beyond boring. Traveling around the world is a pain, and the world itself is pretty small. The dungeons were very unexciting and so were the boss fights.Story - 1/10. The story is extremely straightforward with little depth. To avoid spoilers I won't reveal anything, but I was extremely disappointed with this game's storyline. There is little to no character development.Overall: 3/10. Don't bother playing this one unless one of the following applies to you:1. You're a diehard Final Fantasy fan and don't have access to the DS or Famicon version2. You don't mind running into a game breaking bug that will make you pull your hair outThe story reset bug in this port is game breaking.Example of the bug here: 


YouTube™ Video: FF3 Reset story glitch (PC Version) 

			Views: 1,651		

			Game completely broken. Haven't been able to replicate this glitch on a different save.		

The bug set me back 30+ hours. All I wanted to do was finish the game so I never have to play it again. If you do have your heart set on playing the Steam vesion, try to get it on sale because it is definitely not worth $15.99.			"

												This game is a classic. And anyone who ever played a Final Fantasy-game should probably get it. It really is a great remake of classic that took a very long time to come the rest of the world besides Japan.Pro's:+ They kept the charm of the orginal game (when making this they really kept an eye out to how the original game was made. And especially with the game mechanics, like the job-system and battle-system they kept very close to  the orignal)+ Job System (The job system is a definent pro of this game, you can take on any job any time you want, as long as you have access to it. However you do need to make tactical choices for which character, you gonna lean more on magic, cause when switched you have to begin again)+ Music (The music is one of the plusses of the game, great masterpieces that remind you that you are really playing a JRPG)+ Hope for more to come (Though this might not be linked to the game, it is a pro. Seeing that they did port this game to the PC, who knows what is more to come. The library is still extensive)Maybe's:* Graphics (I personally am very charmed by the graphics. I like this kind of art-style. It's also why I liked a lot of the RPG's on the DS. Plus the fact that they are indeed more detailed then on the DS. But however I can understand that some people are turned of by it. Take a cllose look to the screenshots, cause this is what you gonna get)* Story (The story is a standard RPG-one. World is in peril and you have to save it. It doesn't have any super crazy plot twists or points, but it's more fleshed out then the orginal NES-story.)* Difficulty (The game has a definent steep difficulty curve at some points in the game. Sometimes you can cruise right through a dungeon, only to find out in the next one you are major underleveled. This however is easier then the orginal game. They had also a bit more severe penalties on job-switching. It is a challenge. But if you are up for it. You gonna enjoy this)Con's- None (Personally I don't think this game has any con's really. A few maybe's yes. But it doesn't need you to sign in to Square-Enix as Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII did. It's a real loveletter to the old classic Final Fantasy's. So yeah, it's a good game)			"

												EDIT **** As of June 11 2014 controller issues have been dealth with. Game launches properly and plays fine with my Logitech Rumblepad 2. You can now disregard the comment about controller issues ****By the time of writing this GAME STILL WON'T START WITH CONTROLLER PLUGGED IN, if you're planning to play with a gamepad you're out of luck because Square failed to port it properly.Otherwise it's basically the same FFIII that was recently re-released on android. Gameplay is the same (except for added achievements), so no change here. So far I've spent about 11 hours of ingame time and I haven't encountered any gamebreaking bugs. Except of course for the (lack of) controller support mentioned earlier. Graphics aren't that good, obviously, textures are simply upscaled without any major improvements. There are noticeable graphical artifacts in font used throughout the game (which is a big fail in text based RPG).If you're a fan of the series and you: a) played this on DS and want to revisit on PC or B) haven't played this before than this was made for you.

												A flashy remake of the classic 1990 original, Final Fantasy III retains everything that made the original so enjoyable (Numerous varied Job classes, excellent soundtrack, classic FF gameplay) while adding a few more modern elements (Defined main characters, attractive 3D character models and environments and a re-recorded soundtrack) and even including some new challenges for players to face. While FFIII honestly pales in comparison to the highs of the Final Fantasy series (VI, VII, IX) it is still a classic RPG sporting an excellent facelift. A must play for fans of the series or RPG's in general.Visuals - 8  Sounds - 8  Gameplay - 9  Story - 8			"

												The game itself is fun from what I've played, but I've had a 2 different glitches occur and as such can not recommend the game based on my own experience with it. The first and most notable of the glitches that I've had occur twice now is a game breaking bug that causes the ship you need to sail from island to island to disappear, preventing me from progressing in the game. The first time this happened was when I sailed to an island south of the island with the Tower of Owen before going to the tower like you're supposed to. The other glitch was one that made an invisible wall across the entrance of the lava dungeon, preventing me from leaving. I managed to get out after going through the portal at the end of the dungeon, but this was also the time my ship disappeared for the second time, so once again I couldn't continue the game.			"

												The Job system is always fun to toy with for new strategies, and can help in making the same boss fight play out vastly different. Although a bit on the one-dimensional side, giving the Four Light Warriors an ounce of backstory and personality was a nice touch, and doesn't diminish the minimalist charm for the tale. A couple achievements really aren't worth it, and half are just natural if you intend to complete the game. If you've beaten the DS port, the only real thing this has up on it is you don't need to use Mognet to send letters to friends to unlock equipment and bonus quests (the Mognet messages you need are cued to in-game criteria, thus not as gimmicky). It also took some manual editing of the config file to get my controller to work the way I wanted, since it currently doesn't auto-map buttons. Still, it's a solid port, and one I enjoyed.			"

												Awesome my favorite rpg from ds/psp in 1080p no bugs (configurable controller actually its rare now?).Next would be Final Fantasy IV ds, Final Fantasy IX/V/VI, the recent ios final fantasy and bravely default on pc but I can still dreamThe only issue is the framerate is capped to 30fps(seems like all japanese ports do 30hz),aliasing and jaggy 2d sprites but at least japanese game devs actually are giving pc ports a try hopefully it gets bigger, cause jrpgs or scrollers +pc=awesome specially handheld games I barely use my 3ds. I guess it isnt a total bust since it was from handheld consoles.Just it would look awesome if it had xbr shaders on the 2d and msaa on polygons, maybe full 60fps or uncapped framerate.unless you can inject xbr shaders into d3d or opengl would be cool, could solve the jaggy 2d sprites.Like if it had aa options and 2d scaling like in the  epsxe opengl plugin.just a question if its made high res for pc how come some 2d sprites look the same as on a psp emulator?

												Like the first Final Fantasy it not as easy as the later games as FFX and X-2(In my opinon ofc). dont have any revive for example. So you need to have your party to stay alive. It can be difficult ofc but its much more enjoyable that way. cuz you will get to stay alert at all time. The story itself is very good, it can be hard to remember where you were if you haven't played for awhile but well its not so annoying as you can think. I really loved the game, smooth graphics and awesome that you can change the keys of the controller. Musics gives me the chill.. Square soft is awesome that's the truth.I found the game very enjoyable. But it can be that im an FF-freak, but i believe there are more ppl who loved this game as i did.Totally awesome. Love it!

												This game is the embodiment of core Final Fantasy, the soul of early JRPGs before CG entered the picture. It is however not the original NES version developed by Square, but the recent 3DS remake. That being said, the story, characters, and combat are much the same as the older generations of gamers will remember upon launching the title once more. I would highly recommend this game to FF fans, people who played the original for the nostalgia it brings, and fans of general JRPGs as a whole.11/23/16Still a great game.			"

												I've been trying to work my way through this game, but it's been a slow road. I played it a few hours, got bored, tried FFV to see a better version of the Job System (and pretty much everything else), then came back to this game. I played a few more hours, got bored, then played FFIV because I wanted to play an FF game but was having a tough time playing this game. Then I played FFIV: The After Years, couldn't make it in very far at all because it's a tacky quasi-asset-flip of FFIV with a different story that rips off parts of FFIV's plot, and came back here to FFIII again...or at least I came back to my Steam games list and winced, just staring at this game on the list, not wanting to play it because I had so little motivation and enjoyment from playing it.Anyway, I've made up my mind that I think I'm just going to stop playing FFIII. I played plenty of it to know that I don't like it and that forcing myself to play more of it won't make me like it, so I'll go into a few things I did and didn't like, and explain quite why it is that I have no interest in proceeding more into the game.Final Fantasy Music is Nearly Incapable of SuckingI didn't like FFIII, but I have to give credit where it's due. This game's soundtrack is great. I highly recommend listening to it on Youtube while you're reading articles online or a book, etc. I've gone back and listened to the soundtracks from I & II, and this series just has great music. Nobuo Uematsu is the man. You owe it to yourself to listen to the soundtracks of all the FF games he worked on, and some of more recent ones that even he didn't write. I do not support his ""Crazy Chocobo"" song, though, from FFXIII-2.GraphicsI don't have much to say here. It's got a sort of cutesy look that works well enough. The enemies look a bit meh, even compared to FFIV, which is done in the same style. This version of FFIII definitely looks better, graphically, than screenshots I've seen of the NES version, obviously. My only qualm about the graphics is the need to manually zoom in, which gives you a stupidly close view of everything, and you have to do it fairly often to look fo secrets. The graphics are pretty good.Job System WoesThis is a bit of a precursor to my gameplay section of the review. The job system lets you switch your characters from being warriors, to black mages or red mages, etc. You can do it any time, based on which crystal(s) you've reached in the game. I have issues with FFV, but its job system has reasons to use other jobs. In FFIII, on the other hand, if you are playing the game intelligently, you will almost never change jobs. When you get a better job, you drop the old one and never touch it again. You're rewarded for picking one class/job and sticking with it very far into the game. There are no benefits carried over between jobs/classes based on your progress in a different job/class, and it's just so pointless.FFI and FFII allowed players to select the permanent jobs of their party members when starting the game. Since FFIII has an ideal set of jobs, based on the aforementioned info I covered, FFI and FFI handled jobs better by cutting out the silliness of switching jobs when switching jobs is almost useless. The only times it is worthwhile in FFIII is if you make the entire party something like blackbelts, which will make you able to wipe pretty much every enemy encounter in a turn or two, amounting to easy mode, and switching to your diverse party for the occasional boss, only. Oh, and it's supposedly worthwhile if you plan on power-gaming to character level 99 to use the onion knight class and steamroll the game. What's really silly is that the most efficient way to level your characters' jobs is to have everyone block for a few rounds against the easiest enemy in the entire game, then win the battle. You can reliably level up a job one time per battle, and it takes very little time to do this, thus discouraging fighting as you travel, or even fighting in new areas with tougher monsters. Instead, it enourages you to stay in the easiest map in the game, grinding a job to max, then wiping the floor with everything that's not a boss.As a power-gamer myself, I can tell you that this is pretty broken, but I didn't find this aspect fun, even.Long story short, this job system is pointless and they may as well have just done the FFI and FFII ""pick your party member classes/jobs"" permanently at the start of the game, and just stick to character levels, because my characters had the same basic function for my entire playtime.Story etc (or the lack thereof)If you ever played an FF game from the SNES era, or anything newer than that, and you thought ""that story was a bit too simple,"" FFIII is going to amaze you at how much more simple and boring it can be. I did not complete the game, but from my journeys to the crystals I visited, I was never once interested or entertained by a single moment in the story, or by a single character. I'm not asking for much. I found FFIV's story to be meh, and its characters to be mostly quite shallow, but FFIII managed to suck every ounce of intrigue out of its setting. As far in as I got, the game was bankrupt of anything interesting going on, or any characters I actually liked.In summary, it's one of those stupid ""You're the heroes of light!"" plots where you go see a crystal, visit a town, go to a dungeon, kill a boss, repeat ad nauseum. That happens in other FF games, but they tend to have more interesting stuff happening to keep players intrigued. Here, however, the phrase ""I couldn't care less"" would somehow manage to be an understatement.Okay Gameplay This isn't bad, but it's also not all that good. I do enjoy how the game is turn-based, like FFX is later in the series. I like the active time combat system some of the other games have, but turn-based is nice for coming up with interesting combat strategies that the ATD system might cause players to overlook due to the time constraints of said system. The combat works nice enough, but the game lacks some of the spell variety of FFIV, and without the game mixing up your party like FFIV does, or having a job system with a reason to switch often, like FFV does, meaning FFIII is markedly simple. Simple can be good, but when everything else in the game was so lame to me, I really needed the gameplay to draw me in, and it did not succeed on that front.ConclusionWith FFIII, you get quality music, okay graphics and gameplay, and a world that's Final Fantasy at its most regurgitated basic fantasy level, which characters who are arguably more disinteresting than the setting and what I saw of the story. I am not disparaging FFIV or FFV, because I think they did a pretty good job with the pre-FFVI fantasy settings the series leaned toward. The job system is one of FFIII's biggest features, but it's flawed to the point that its existence was not needed and choosing classes at the start would have been just fine, as in FFI and FFII. My recommendation is that you avoid this game, play something better instead, and check out the FF soundtracks, because there are some great songs out there.			"

												This game is the embodiment of core Final Fantasy, the soul of early JRPGs before CG entered the picture. It is however not the original NES version developed by Square, but the recent 3DS remake. That being said, the story, characters, and combat are much the same as the older generations of gamers will remember upon launching the title once more. I would highly recommend this game to FF fans, people who played the original for the nostalgia it brings, and fans of general JRPGs as a whole.11/23/16Still a great game.			"

												So, first ever Steam review so please be nice!As a long time FF fan, I picked FF3 up as a historical curiosity more than anything, and frankly, that's the only reason to play it.  Time hasn't been kind to it, and it remains a fairly trite roll through JPRG cliches of the last 20 years.That's not to say it's without merit.  It's perfectably serviceable, it functions and controls well, looks fairly decent for a DS port, has interesting challenges and generally does everything it needs to satisfactorily.  If you're not looking for anything mind-blowing or deep then it's a pretty fun way to kill 20 hours or so.However, it is incredibly straightforward.  There's none of the emotional depth we've come to associate with the FF series, the characters are droll to the point of non-existence, the plot a simple series of macguffin fetch quests.  The job system is superficially interesting, but obtuse and grind-heavy.  The world is twee and standard, filled with cut-and-paste towns devoid of charm or character.Overall, if you're simply looking for a simple fun romp through JRPG tropes you could do a lot worse, but don't expect any more than that.  For more mature, deep or involving games, you should probably look elsewhere.			"

I'd expect more from you.Just recompiling to port something is not enough in my opinion.			"

												As someone who has played nearly every Final Fantasy game, I can say clearly in my opinion this IOS port of FF3 is not worth the full price tag, and if you did decide to pick it up i would suggest waiting till it becomes on sale. My main reason for saying that is because of what i said in the first line, it is nearly an exact IOS port, and in my opinion is not worth the 16ish dollars they are charging for the game. Another huge issue i have with the game that i find very frustrating is the combat. This game uses the job system, and the set up for the job system is what makes it a deal breaker for me. For you're character to get points to level up their job, they have to take action in battle. If two of you're characters kill all the foes before you're other two members get a chance to attack, then only the two who fought get the job points for that battle. So if you happen to be using the mage classes, it will be very difficult to keep them up to pace with the other jobs because they will hardly ever get points. If you are loyal FF fan and you can get past the issues, then this game might we worth picking up if it was on sale. But i paid full price for the game, and can already tell that i 100% regret it.

												LAZY LAZY LAZY PORT!!!  I would only bother with this one if you have not played it on the DS or an Android/IOS versions.  The graphics are NOT updated for pc! Other than having support for higher resolutions. Wich is pointless because they kept the same low res textures. No anti alaising /No shadows or anything new in effects. The lack of these tweeks really hurt the potential of the games visuals. the game looks decent and is very playable. It just could have and SHOULD HAVE been a lot better if they had tried. It's not asking to much to put in features that have been standard for the last decade! Square lies AGAIN !   My thumbs down is more the fact that Square slapped this together and resold it as Enhanced when they really did virtualy nothing new in the game. I would be be fine with it as is if not for the claims of upgrading it for the PC. The adjustments are very minor and odds are an emulated version of the DS game would look as good if not better.  In sumation looks okish, plays good,. does NOT however meet the claims made not even close. You Dont upconvert a VHS and call it an all new HD experience on blu ray  thats just insulting. Also essentialy what they did. add some bells and whistles maybe some higher RES textures then call it PC enhanced. Enjoy it if you like just don't expect it to live up to its descriptor and you shouldn't be disapointed.			"

												As lovely as this remake is I strongly recommend you skip this title and even if your a video game historian. Not to say there isn't a lot to love about this title but you will pay for it with an insane amount of grinding not to mention mandatory guide usage. Most of the enjoyment comes from framing your play through via the context of wow look how much things changed from FF 1+2, look how ambitious they were etc. But ultimately you will create a far more enjoyable memory of this title if you just watch the walkthroughs of this game, there is very little characterization and any enjoyment of the jobs systems depth will be destroyed by the monotony of the grind. There are far better FF titles worthy of your time as this title hasn't aged well at all I'm afraid.			"

												This is the same version as the one that was ported to Android/iOS/DS. It works pretty well and the controls can be remapped to your liking within the settings (you will want to do this as the game doesn't really do a tutorial immediately, but rather after the first ""mission."" I prefer to have the controls mapped to your typical wasd setting and replaced ""enter"" with the ""f"" key so I play a majority of the time with my left hand). There are many options for resolutions, though it should be noted that the resolution is not at a 16:9 ratio but a 4:3 from the looks of things. A complaint that I have is that under settings they give you the option of playing the game in fullscreen, which is nice right? Well the game seems to default to fullscreen no matter what you put down so keep that in mind. My biggest complaint is that the price is higher than Final Fantasy VII and VIII, however I understand that the game itself is available on iOS and Android for the same price of $15, so the publisher is to blame for the high price. The game itself is a classic within the RPG genre, and I myself enjoy the unique look that was given to this game as it differs from your typical FF art style. I would strongly recommend you consider buying the game if it dips as low as Final Fantasy VII and VIII (roughly around $11).			"

And it's garbage for one major reason. There is a big game breaking bug that seems to trigger randomly and without warning. And once it triggers, it resets you story progression! And if you don't notice this until after you saved... whelp that's it for you, GG start over and pray. This game has been out for almost a year and this is STILL an issue! Save your money, go buy FF3 for the DS. Just for the love of god, don't buy it for PC.			"

I know this game originally came out something like 20 years ago, but that's no excuse not to improve it. Square Enix makes great games, but this one simply doesn't belong on Steam. It's an ugly, confusing mess and it pains me to criticize it the way I do.			"

												I hate to give a negative rating to a Final Fantasy title, but I have to say that this is the Final Fantasy I enjoyed the least. This game is hard, but that is something that grinding can fix. What really bothered me, is that you are a good level to complete everything in the game except the final boss. What made it worse is that you can't save anywhere after a certain point and this means have to play 2 hours without saving before you can try the final boss. You can beat anything else in that dungeon, even the mini bosses and then you need another 30 levels before you can even attempt the final boss. This is not how I wish to invest my time in a game.

												One of the games in the series that wasn't originally published in the US. FF III Introduces the job system - a staple in later games in the series. A fair remake of an 8-bit game, with updated polygonal graphics (a port of the Nintendo DS version), modern audio, animated cut scenes, and illustrated character profiles. There are some heldover design relics though - such as a clunky interface and useless quick save system (quick saves are not persistent).As brutal as any early Final Fantasy game if one does not know where to go for leveling. The challenge makes for rewarding advancement. Exploration is encouraged, even backtracking over previously cleared areas can reveal new items. Classic Final Fantasy turn-based combat, and the kind of whimsical story telling you're probably expecting.			"

												While I didn't play very long, there have been no patches since the other negative reviews that would fix the bugs. More annoyingly is the fact that this is among the blost blatant mobile ports I've ever played, wasting horrendous amounts of screen space and having bad controls for no real reason.This seems minor until you realize that in battle you can only see three options at a time - the store page's fifth screenshot illustrates this. On a mobile device that makes sense, but this is a PC port. A lazy one, but laziness doesn't excuse itself.I've played the DS version, the PSP version, and even the Famicom original - if you have the means to do so, go for one of those. It's a good game, with the caveat of being rather unforgiving, this is just a very lazy port.			"

What really upset me about this game is its 'simplicity'.I think they had some amazing ideas and concepts in this game but I felt they didnt elaborate more on them.For example.The magic system is broken down into different 'levels' 1-8 if I recall. For each level of magic requires its own 'MP'. The higher your Job level the more MP you gain. Not a bad system to that point, what really lets it down is you can only have 3 spells on each level. As far as I know and I could indeed be wrong but you cannot remove the spells once learned, again dont take my word on this point but I couldn't personally, remove them.The only way to gain MP is through 'springs' and 'resting @ an Inn'. Sometimes there are just none of either. So yeah, fustratting.The Jobs part of the game is far too shallow.  The ONE thing that drives me insane and I mean INSANE is the sheer amount of 'random battles', I mean dear mother of god  you cant go a few feet but you're in yet ANOTHER battle. It makes the game incredibly annoying and you combine that with a few of the points I made above, it makes for just a pain in the butt experience.The storyline seems decent but the game mechanics are too simple.In short if your a die hard fan such as myself, then play this, you'll enjoy it to some extent anyway.Other than that, I dont recommend this one.

												Ah, FFIII. Originally released on the Famicom only in Japan, which caused quite a lot of confusion with the numbering, this is the last Final Fantasy (or at least the last numbered one) made for the third generation of gaming (NES/Sega Master System). After a 3D remake on the DS and a few ports later, it's finally on Steam.Unfortunately, this remake is *too* faithful, and it doesn't quite hold up. There's no real sense of direction after the first dungeon, which you are dropped in straight away (literally). *SPOILERS* After you deal with a few random encounters and beat the boss, a crystal talks to you, and you appear on the overworld. You go to your town, watch a friend get bullied and then run off, talk to the village elders who basically say, ""You have been chosen since birth by the crystals! It was no coincidence that it spoke to you now! Oh, and by the way, you're adopted!"" (I kid you not, they flat out tell your character that he's adopted, and he has no reaction to that. It's not even because he's a silent protag, he just doesn't say anything back)*SPOILERS END*Unlike the FFIV DS remake, there are no thought bubbles that appear when you use your menu on the world map, which would add some character to the otherwise stereotypical characters. You have your flat, adventurous main character, his best friend, a random girl you meet on an airship, and a castle guard. By the way, they're all 14 for whatever reason, even the castle guard, and they all look like they could be older. Don't expect the rest of the game to be any less cliche.The OST is nice, I suppose. The standard town and battle music is good, but not great. The music for the Sealed Cave, the first dungeon, is...interesting. It's good, but it's not really what I would've expected for the first non-tutorial dungeon. I especially like ""Into the Crystal Cave"", as well as ""Eternal Wind"", and ""Jinn's Curse"", and that's all that I've liked from what I've heard so far.The plot is slightly more complex than Final Fantasy I in that your characters actually speak and have...well...character! The plot is still plastic, and you still have to go on a cliche fetch quest for crystals after being declared the chosen ones, though. Also, *MINOR SPOILERS* you get an airship not even an hour into the game, which seems odd to me. I thought airships were things you got in the middle of the game, not right at the beginning with no effort. I'm not sure if I'm upset about it, because on one hand you get to experience the freedom of flight earlier, and on the other hand it cheapens the concept of getting an airship.*MINOR SPOILERS OVER*The visuals are probably the best part about this game. The chibi style and colorful palette makes the world seem inviting and playful, which is probably the only reason I even played more after I got out of the tutorial dungeon. In this case, the graphics did make the game for me.The gameplay, like the plot, is only slightly more complex than Final Fantasy I's. If you've played FFI, you know that if you make all your characters attack one enemy and the first hit or so kills it, the rest of your attacks will be ""ineffective"", because their target is already dead. This is the first game to fix that, and it does so by automatically selecting a new target for a given character's attack. Brilliant, right? Still, because this is FFIII and not FFIV, there is no ATB, which means that instead of a gauge filling up for a given character so they can attack, you just select new commands at the end of each ""turn"", like Pokemon. However, Pokemon has several type advantages and disadvantages, 4 moves per Pokemon, and loads of other things to make the combat more complex, while FFIII just has your choice of weapons, and I suppose a unique ability here and there when you meet more playable characters. Sure, the elemental black magic will be more effective against certain types, but it's still not the same complexity as in Pokemon, and even then, not everyone has black magic (although there is a way to give everyone black magic, but it's not worth it). For an apt analogy concerning FFIII's combat compared to FFIV's, think of coaching a football/soccer/other sport game vs. playing in one. FFIII is where you coach.Oh, still on the topic of combat, sometimes enemies are faster than you, sometimes you're faster than them. It doesn't even seen to be a constant thing during the same battle, and so it can't possibly be due to different enemies being different levels even though they're the same type of enemy. This pretty much makes any strategy impossible to rely on 100%, which means straight up luck is now a factor. I suppose luck is also a factor in real life combat, but this isn't real life. When you get to the first actual dungeon, prepare to get destroyed if you didn't grind a lot beforehand. Yeah, it's one of those RPGs.Should FFIII have stayed in Japan? Nah. While I bash on it quite a bit in this review, it's great to look at how far the franchise has come. Gotta have bad games to appreciate good ones, and all. Still, I can't in good faith recommend this to anyone, or at least this version, RPG lover or not. I hear the PSP version is the best, but I have not played much of it despite owning it. I'll update this review if/when I bring myself to play more of this version, but for now, I must give it the thumbs down.			"

												This is a bad port. It's like they gave one guy, one week, to get it ready for PC. I could live with the bad texturing, if that was all that was wrong. The enviroment art probably just looked low budget on the DS. It's just that when played on a larger screen, it stands out like, ""LOOK AT ALL THESE SEAMS"". Minecraft texture pack artists would shake their heads, and wonder how this passed quality controls at SquareEnix. Do they even have quality control for ports?Then there's the controls. No one even managed to add proper controller support. On a game that was ported from a console. How does that happen? I bought the game after a few patches, but when an on-screen prompt is displayed, it askes me to push a button on a Nintendo controller. Not a keyboard button, not an Xbox360 controller button, or a generic equivalent. Going into the menu to look them up, led to finding just a random numbering of buttons on the controller. Indie devs usually do a better job than this.And I am only an hour into the game. I'll probably add more to this as I play. If you can find this for a hand-held the experience is probably better there.			"

												Cant really recommend this port in this state.  I have encountered 3 game breakign bugs within 7 hours of play time.  I have had my ship disappear off the world map and it effectively locks you from doing anything else in the game.  I've had to redo the last two boss fights, because after the fights the ship just is not there.  Not sure, but feels like a bad port. I recommend final fantasy 3 though, the game itself is great.Edit..The bugs continued.  Now in Amur after i do the sewers the ship is gone again, the boots she gives you in the sewers arent working for me, i can glitch and walk through the water, game is effectively ruined because i cant progress from here.  I'm not going to replay every boss fight because of glitches. Horrible port.			"

												I don't really know if I can really recommend this game.It is a great game with classic Final Fantasy gameplay which I love. However I have run into a game breaking glitch. I am not sure how common it is but Viking's Cove and the Nepto Temple dungeon keep reseting Themselves which makes it literally impossible for me to progress further in the game. Although I can keep running through the dungeon and farm Nepto eyes for no reason at all (yay! -_-)If it wasn't for that glitch I would totally recommend this game for anyone that loves the Final Fantasy series.

(now, I haven't finished the game, so you might get something more on this later on)The combat is fine, although a bit grindy.The game might be ok for you if you enjoy this type of game, but the other ff titles are so much better in my opinion.

												A terrible port.It's a shoddy port(I don't mean the graphics, I actually like the visuals), with a very large number of game breaking bugs(including, from what I've heard, many that can reset your progress in the game to the start, cause saves to vanish... or prevent the game from starting up at all).In my case, the game breaking bug happened early.. I was asked to name my first party member. I couldn't. I couldn't enter anything. Including just using his generic name..From my understanding, Enix has also showed no signs of patching it any time soon.It's also very retro, in a bad way.Lots of griding, and very frequent random encounters(3-6 steps between them)			"

												Short review. This is a plotless, characterless, timewasting grind.Long Review.Lets start with the basics. I used to play the old final fantasy games on the SNES, which were great and even now worth playing on an emulator. I saw this on sale, saw the job class system and was reminded of one of my favourite FF games with the same idea. I thought i'd enjoy this game even more with the enhanced graphics and suchlike. Wrong.The job classesI'm about a quarter of the way through the game and i'm about level 25 out of level 99 on my first job for each character. It is only because of reading the wiki page I find out that there is no significant benefit at all to mastering a class.In the prior version, sticking with a class and mastering it was a good idea. If one of your characters mastered being a white mage, then you could select white magic as a secondary ability when you started a new class. This allowed for interesting and varied job combinations. This new version makes you start from scratch every time you start a new job. There are even better versions of the starting jobs which you will have to grind through again to make them any good since they will draw no benefit from having ground from the basic class. Utter time wasting and demoralising.The charactersWeak and shallow. A few lines of dialogue to establish the basic idea and then thats it. You might get one line here and there to create the illusion that the characters have any depth, but really? I've not met one person in the game which with a worthwhile personality. Even the villains which should be the driving force of a game are non-exisitant. Once you've ground through a dungeon you get to meet someone with two lines of dialogue before you kill them. Yawn. This is just endless grinding, over and over.The plotWait? There's a plot? Really? A few lines from some crystal to tell you that you're the chosen one and then you're off. Um... is that it? You bet it is. Save the world? Uh... it looks fine to me. No maurading armies, no cataclysmic natural disasters, no iconic villians with master plans. Just a vague reference to darkness being imbalanced. It's like a stoned aromatherapist ate some alphabet soup and♥♥♥♥♥♥out a story.OverallIf you like endless grinding and having to start characters over again and again, not having to worry about plots, characters or indeed anything being memorable about the game, then this is the one for you.I'm going to be uninstalling this and finding a SNES emulator to play some decent final fantasy.

												While I like the fact that Squre Enix is attempting to let people play games that they may not have had access too in the past this game sufferes from one critical flaw which to me makes it pointless to pay for... even 2 cents is too much for it.  Before I go into the negative aspects though let me touch on some of the positives.  This game has many good things going for it, the first of which I already mentioned, its a game that alot of folks never had access too.Next its based off fo the Nintnedo DS/PSP rerelease of the game, which orginially was on the Nintendo Entertainment System (well techinically the Famicom but alot of folks dont know what that is) so don't expect the new combat styles of say Final Fantasy XIII.  This is classic old school Final Fantasy goodness... and the basis of which you see reflected in many future games.  Some things such as the job system are still seen feflected in the modern games.  The graphics are nice, though the font is a little ugly, the music as always is beautiful.What kills this game completley for me is are simple things that Square Enix could fix and in fact I've contacted Square Enix about and they dont really care about them.  If you are playing the game with and I mean this litterally, ANY NON MICROSOFT 360 WIRED CONTROLLER then the game will lock up and freeze on you.  I worked with Square about this and their solution was to unplug my Mad Catz Wired Xbox 360 controller and plug in a Microsoft branded one.  Though playtesting I can confirm that even having the controller plugged in but not in use crashes the game.Edit:  I can confirm that a wired Xbox 360 controller works just fine.  For anyone curious as to why the Microsoft 360 Wireless controller doesn't work, its because it requires Bluetooth, even when pluged in using an USB adapter.  All the USB adapter does is charge the controller it doesn't acutally function as in the same way a wired controller does.So in short they don't want you to pay 15 for the game.  They want you to pay 15 for the game, and approximately 40 for the controller makeing the cost of this Final Fantasy game 55 dollars.  (Edit:  You can now find the controllers for around 25 dollars on sites like Amazon, but still its an unstaded addtional cost if you want to use a controller.)  Yes I could play the game with nothing plugged in but as someone who plays a lot of diffrent games on my cast this isn't very reasonable, plus Final Fantasy Games just don't feel right being played with a keyboard.  (Edit:  In addition as many people who have problems with carpal tunnel have pointed out using a controller is much easyer on them ta hen using the keyboard.)In short the cost of this game is 55 bucks.... I can go buy a brand new Triple A title game for that much.  I'd rather just get this while its on sale on PSN (which happens fairly regularly) or get a modded DS so I can play my DS version.  Avoid at all costs untill fixed IMHO.Edit:  Since I can now post a longer version of this I wanted to expand my review.  Another problem with this veresion of the game is that it has many bugs.  One of which is a fatal game flaw in which if characters die you can lose all your progress.  By this I mean you can lose the abilitiy to change jobs, your ships/boats which are required for travel, and other simular bugs.This has since been verified by a caster I have a great amount of respect for: Crumps2 who is currently (as of 12/4/14) playing though all the Final Fantasy games on Twitch.tv.  This has caused him and Cereth the other caster that is playing though all the games to acutally ABANDON this game untill such time as they can get modified Nintendo DS systems to be able to play the game.  Once again, buy at your own risk.			"

												Final Fantasy III is an unrewarding grind with a so-simple-it's-convoluted story reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts'.  The story is about the balance between light and darkness--and the game lectures and reminds the player about this balance a few hundred times throughout, as New Age-plagued JRPGs often do.Its gameplay is where it fails on virtually every level: Most of the jobs are useless, half the abilities in the game are bugged and simply don't work, and players will lose hours upon hours of progress due to a complete absence of in-dungeon save points.  You can only save on the world map, and some dungeons are 5+ hours long.Even players who only desire a peek at the advent of Final Fantasy's Job System will be disappointed, as the game's combat shoehorns players into a select few jobs, rendering the remainder not only unusable, but boring and uninspired as well.  For example, over half of the game's jobs are mere upgrades to existing jobs, offering nothing of substance on a gameplay level.The music and graphics are sometimes surprisingly good.I recommend this game to hardcore completionists and to Final Fantasy XIV fans who want to see the origins of the ""Crystal Tower"" raid.  To anyone else: don't waste your time.  Final Fantasy III is just not good enough to justify the time investment.			"

I would do quests and they would not regester, leaving me to redo them (i.e did ghost quest twice, did ruby snake eye quest three times, first time having to do it twice then again all the way through gnome village after getting ship, saving and logging). Although the extra loot was nice, within the first few hours of playing I had to redo quests leaving me stranded because the ship I had received as a reward was at the next location but yet I did not have credit for the quest even though I did it twice leaving me stranded only to admire my reward from afar. There have been many glitches within the first few hours and I encourage all to not waste the money.			"

This game is litterally a port of a port of a port and has done nothing to stand out agenst its predecesors besides adding keybord controls. The the ipone port of the ds port was already bad, with it leaving recovery items few and far between, and constant level griding just to get past the first boss of the game, this already screamed failer before square though about puting it on pc. I warn you now don't get this game, waterboarding is a better alternitive. 3/10And on a side not squenix, if your capable of porting the dragon quest series on to the iphone with significant changes, then there is no reason why you cant port most of those dragon quest, or even Final Fantasy 9 games on to steam. you already ported a port of a port of a port of a game, so why not show some love for the people who want actually want these games to be relesed on steam "

Quick review: +Fun battle system+Fun development system+Interesting world+Good writing-Story feels its age-Development system lacks any major depth-Convoluted magic system-Difficulty curve is weird*This review is based on the game Final Fantasy III, not just this particular port*Final Fantasy III is a mixed bag that shows it age but still remains solid in gameplay, development and fun.The story is standard fare, you play as an orphan collecting crystals and saving the world. Obviously there are more nuances there, but this is where the game truly feels its age with each character essentially being a blank canvas. The writing is interesting enough to offset the generic overtones though, it's generally something that Square are very good at. I want to emphasize that the story itself isn't bad though, you just shouldn't go in expecting something incredible.(There's nothing wrong with this trope, seeing as Square was a large part of its popularity)The gameplay is traditional turn based, using your agility stat to determine where you appear in a queue. Some abilities have higher priorities and will therefore be used first, if your agility equals someone elses.The development system uses the Job system, and FFIII was the first Final Fantasy that let you freely change jobs outside of battle. You have jobs like White Mage (healer), Black Mage (nuker) and Knight (tank). There are lots of jobs to use, and you can make a party of your choosing. The development system is relatively shallow, but has enough depth to keep things interesting. This system was then perfected in Final Fantasy V. (steam release please)The Magic system is a little bit iffy, instead of having a standard MP pool, you have a number of uses tacked on to each level of magic (which raises through levels) which means you could use nine level 1 spells and still use a level 2 spell after that, assuming you had charges for level 2 magic. You're also limited to only 3 slots per level of magic, meaning you have to make a decision on which magicks you want to use (especially if you use a red mage) I feel like they improved on this in subsequent titles. (MP pool, no choosing magicks)The difficulty curve can make the game frustrating at points and too easy at other points, but it's never unfair or completely simple.Visually the game looks OK. I've never personally been a fan of the DS esque chibi art though, so take that with a grain of salt. The game itself upscales pretty well, and looks nice on the PC unless you stare too intently and some of the textures.The controls are ok, and very intuitive if you're using a controller and you've ever played another Final Fantasy game. The menus can be a bit sluggish sometimes, but it's never to the point of frustration. The zoom feature can be a pain sometimes too, but again it's never too bad.Is this game worth the price tag? Yes and no. You will get £11($17)'s worth of content out of the game, but it does seem a little pricey seeing as this is a port of a port, and considering that you can buy FFVII and VIII for so cheap on steam currently. If you're a fan of the series or want a solid turn based RPG to keep you busy for a while, then I'd suggest picking it up. If you're unsure then I would wait until it comes on sale.Oh and the music? The music is fantastic.			"

It's an insult to the original version and everyone who poured blood, sweat and probably tears into making it fully realised on the NES.. An 8bit system that's a sneeze in comparison to the machine this was originally released on, let alone the modern computer that's multitudes more powerful than that...

												Again, a port of a port (this was ported from the DS to Android and then to PC/Steam). This sounds bad, but the game actually can be modded to be a little more PC friendly.Even so, the game is plainly bad. It requires an inhumane amout of griding to actually get strong and being able to do some of the optional stuff, or even the obligatory one.And yes, the Final Fantasy franchise is about being able to do some optional stuff, with some difficult but not as nearly as the one this game demands.Just to finish, I'm a long time Final Fantasy player and expert. If you want something better with a job system, stick to FFV, a much better port and game.			"

												You want to play ""Final Fantasy III"":- To gain an appreciation for where the series, and many of its defining characteristics, come from.  This is where the Job Change system and many of the archetypes in ""Final Fantasy"" started.You don't want to play ""Final Fantasy III"" because:- There are too many random battles.  You won't be able to walk around for five seconds without getting into another one sometimes.- Most battles are unimaginative and consist only of attacking and healing as necessary.- The story is dull.  As are the characters.  In the original NES version, they were all silent protagonists.  Now, they talk.  They're just as flat and lifeless, but now you must suffer through dialogue.			"

												It's incomparable to the other FFs in a bad way. Sense of where to go in this game is awful, one of the world maps is just barren with no real marker of where to go. You can get lost for awhile. Sometimes you'll wander and encounter monsters just too tough. Airships can't fly over mountains, only hop on certain ranges. Job classes are forced into the storyline and are just unneeded, can't even begin to imagine how many times you had to cast mini ot toad on yourself and then cure yourself immediately after. Extremely disappointed in this instalment, I've played FF1-FF12, full completed all of them with maxed characters. I can say without doubt FF3 was the worst, did not want to do any other additional sidequests.			"

												If You like Final Fantasy this will be a good game. The story will be a bit short, but it's ok.Also the graphics are well done, but i'd prefere the oldschool 2D-style of this game, cause i think it fits more with the not too big story line.It was fun playing this game and i was totaly into the story. Even though the story is short, the game is really time consuming(like in every FF^^). The one thing that frustrated me immensly was that you couldn't save in the tower at the end. So I used quicksave the whole 5~ hours until the last fight. I didnt win and when I started the game again, my quicksave was gone and inaccessable. I have not felt like playing through this again, and don't know if I ever will. Very very frustrating.			"

												Unless you love to grind you should probably skip this poorly ported game.Good things:1.  Graphics update.2. Final Fantasy nostalgia.Bad things:1. The interface was not update for PC and there is a lot of vital information that should be displayed somewhere that isn't.   Job for example only tell you the name of the job.  Not what your character does as that job or a description of the skills or anything.  As far as I can tell this information is in the paper manual that comes with the DS version of the game.  This doesn't appear to be included with the PC version at all.  So unless you go googleing your only option is trial and error.I recommend skipping this game unless you enjoy a Final Fantasy grind fest.			"

												I completed all other games in this series up to FF X-2,so I had to finish this one for the sake of completion.The game itself was okay-ish and it didn't bug out on me.Don't expect the core game to be ""updated to 201X standards"".It doesn't guide you a lot and many character attributes and items stay unexplained forever.In the end, the game was/is rather frustrating though:- The Impossible Achievement: ""Reach Job lvl 99 for each job on each character"". That alone would take 100+ Hours of grinding. No thanks!- Attack Magic is useless. I had a thief, knight and dragoon. they all hit for 9999 when I was lvl 50. Black Magic (comparable job levels) did around 6000 damage. It was weaker and had limited charges.- You need a white mage. You have no choice. Healing Items are not comparable.- Turn order in combat is random. The skills selected by enemies (incl. Bosses) is random: boss has last turn and uses powerful attack, that hits all characters. Next round the boss gets the first turn and does the same. Nearly impossible to survive, if it happens. Happened to me twice during my playthrough (second time was the final boss)=> Not worth the full price. If you just want to ""play all final fantasy parts"", get it for 50% or less.If you want to play another ""good RPG"", you should probably keep searching.			"

												Just refunded this game, so yeah...FF3 is an excellent game. I didn't refund it due to the game itself, but rather this port.The only differences between this version and the android version are Achievements and Controls.This version does NOT have touch controls, which honestly makes no sense not to have as an option, even though the touch controls feel/work way better and faster than keyboard/controller controls.This version markets itself as HD. It is NOT HD, on ANY resolution - the Android/iOS version has the same exact resolution! Especially when changing resolution options, larger resolutions just make the game look grainy, while on the smartphone it actually looks great.Neither this version nor the Android/iOS version are ergonomic on tablets (Android, W10, or otherwise), so it's really a question of smartphone or PC/laptop.Smartphone wins.Only, ONLY get this version if it's like super discounted, or you are an achievement nut.

												UPDATE:  2014/06/11The game starts!  Square must have patched it up, so here's my initial thoughts:  it's still a lackluster port.  If you have never played FFIII and love JRPGs, then you will really enjoy it, and the PC version has the most potenial.  The menu lay-out is spot on the mobile version (which I played on my Androids, GS2 and GS4) and the controls NEED to be changed to make sense.  Otherwise, I'm keeping my eye out for the numerous reported launch glitches.Overall, I do not recommend this game.  Final Fantasy 3 is possibly the hardest in the franchise and compared to later games, it's a bit weird.  The characters (who didn't exist in the original NES version) are all card-board cut outs, and they don't even have basic architypes applied to them, so they're uninteresting, and the game's overall plot--while unique--is predictable and cliched (cliched due to setting the bar, not jumping on existing cliches).  Combat is basic, and character leveling and skill management is difficult to understand and never feels like it's making an impact, so grinding levels and items is always a chore in FFIII, plus you're in constant fear that a character may faint and you'll have to rush to a town with a revive fountain because Phoenix Downs are scarce.If you are a fan of JRPGs or Old School RPGs, then I can't recommend playing this game overall, and this should be the best version of this classic, but I strongly feel most gamers will get upset or frustrated with this title.  I loved the Nintendo DS version, but I've played every game in the series (at least the main series) and understand that this one is black-sheep-ish compared to the styles and gameplay of the later games.This game totally isn't worth $16 by the way.  The genre and indsutry changing classic, Final Fantasy VII is only $12, but that even seems too high for 3, considering it brings nothing new to the table.  It's just the iPhone/Android version, which was a single-screen DS version.  There's no update to the aesthetics and no content that improves the game, and 2006 DS graphics do not look good on a PC monitor made in the last ten years.tldr, JRPG fans will like it, but it is a more advanced JRPG, so general gamers won't get into it.

												This is by far the worst Final Fantasy Remake I have ever played. The graphics are terrible, the gameplay and storyline are completely lacking any heart or substance, and the 3D element is horrible! The game itself is extremely bad, as you continually die and do not have the opportunity to revive yourself before a boss. You do not have the option to buy Pheonix downs, and whenever you do find them you end up using them immediately. You also never have the option for healing party members by using tents or ethers, and any Elixer you find along the way are also used up almost immediately. I will never figure out why Square-Enix didn't simply remake this game in the same style as the first two Final Fantasy games for the NES (which were awesome) because this one is horrible beyond words. I would never recommend this game to anyone ... and sincerely hope this will not be the new style for Final Fantasy games.			"

												I was really looking forward to getting this game since I really enjoyed the whole job system in Final Fantasy Tactics. However after I spent at least 30 hours powerleveling my jobs for awhile I found that once I advanced to the next continent I received a nice little bug that made it impossible for me to change jobs. Now I have absolutely no way to finish this game as all of my characters are stuck into being Onion Knights for the remainder of the game. I'm not sure about anyone else but not being able to change jobs in a game that is all about changing jobs seems like a complete failure of this port. My recommendation for anyone considering buying this game is for you to steer clear. If you have it and were able to avoid getting this bug then I am supremely happy for you since it is such a great game. But for all the rest of you who encountered this error. I feel your pain. If you do intend to buy this game after everything I have just stated I have one recommendation for you and that is to have multiple save files in order to eliminate the chance of you getting the bug in your game as well as always checking that you can change jobs before you save.

												Steam won't refund it since I played it for more than two hours (what kind of stupid policy is that anyway?) so I guess I'll just write a bad review instead:Final Fantasy 3 is a pretty tight old school RPG that got an updated port for the DS and PSP a while back that improved the game quite a bit. The screenshots being in 3D may lead you to believe that this is a port of that version of the game, but don't be a fooled like I was: this is (for some reason I really don't understand) a port of the mobile phone version of the game. This is a problem for a few reasons:1) The menus are huge and ugly and clearly designed for touch interfaces (something this game doesn't support on PC even if you wanted to use it). Not really a functionality issue but I just think it looks really bad and doesn't even make sense since the PSP version's interface would've looked much better and less cluttered on a PC/laptop screen;2) It's buggy. I noticed this possibly even before the apparent two hour limit for refunds, when it made me repeat the scene in the dragon's nest like three times before actually letting me leave. I determined that this was probably due to me using the thief's flee skill to escape from Bahamut rather than the generic run away option. Kind of annoying but I decided to just ignore it. I shouldn't have though because the next bug was game breaking. At some point (I'm not sure when because I didn't plan to change any character's jobs until unlocking more, so I didn't notice until obtaining the second crystal) the job menu in my save file became permanently greyed out. I googled and it turns out I just straight up can't use it on this save anymore. Ever. There's no fix. I'm locked into the jobs from the beginning of the game forever. I could technically grind a bunch and probably beat the game with them but the job system is this game's defining feature so what's the point?;3) It's common knowledge to keep lots of save files in RPGs to prevent something like this happening. I would've done that but due to this game being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port of a mobile game it only has three save slots. This is another thing that isn't an issue in the PSP version that they should've just ported instead, but they didn't.Final Fantasy 3 is a good game if you're into old party cusomtization-driven RPGs but the bugginess and limited number of save slots combine to completely ruin this version of it. I do recommend the PSP, DS and even NES versions of it, but avoid this one at all costs.			"

												What didn't i like about this game?Well for starters, the game does not help you along the way at all, no hints, no tips, no tutorial, nothing. Now before you point your pitchforks at me let me explain. i'm ok that a game dosen't hold your hand all the way, i'm just asking to learn the very basic of the game to be able to play. For example, the game does not autosave, you have to do that on your own. Fair enought, i'll just save manually, BUT WAIT, you can't save while your in a dungeon or town, you have to be in the world map to save. it's things like that i whould like to know before starting playing the game, becuse the first time i played this game, i went into a dungeon, died, and had to start a completely new savefile beacuse i haden't saved yet. I did realise later that there where NPC that told you about things like this but if you just happen to not talk to them, you missed out on that critical information and was kinda doomed to figure it out on your own. Another thing i could not wrap my head around was the job system and the weapon support for every job. Job's are kinda like classes and as you raise yor job level you get stronger. Once again the game does not tell you what perks a job had, which weapon you can use while having a certain job, what spells you can use etc. You could learn this by talking to a specific NPC but once again, if you didn't you had to figure it out on your own. Also as you progressed you unlocked more jobs but changing to a new job makes your job level 1 again and you have to farm to be able to match the current level of the mobs and teammates.That brings us to the weapon support, it was wierd. Now leveling up your job was just half the jouney, you had to have a good weapon to harvest that sweet level you grined for. Only thing is, the weapons your job requiered was only sold a specific stores at specific locations. You could pass two town with a certain job and almost don't get any support at all. This made it even harder to play certain jobs and which made me change back to other jobs just to be able to pass some areas. That resulted in me having to farm to get back the exp i lost while playing as another job. It was either that or playing as an almost usless charachter that made ruffly a third (or less) of the damage my teammates did.Now get me right, i'm not agains farming. It's a great way to stay one step before the game, dedecating time to making your playthrough easier/funnier. But when the game requieres you to farm to progress, it's just get's boring.This formula repeated itself several times and at this point i did not enjoy playing it anymore and just gave up on it.I whould not recommend playing this game, i felt like it made it hard and boring to play certain parts of the game when i really should be fun and exciting. Not everything about this game is bad, heck, most thing are pretty good. But it wasn't enought for me to keep playing it.			"

												Completely worth it, satisfied my need for a old school rpg. Good old fashioned turn based strategy, Loved it from start to finish. Wrapped it up in about 30hrs, Not a very deep story but certainly didn't feel like it hindered the fun.The 23 different jobs you get to pick from certainly can make battles a little more interesting, Can be talored to make many different playing styles. I'll admit I really didn't make much use of it, but you can be more strategic using different jobs for each dungeon to make life easier. Spent entire game as a variation of attacker, black mage, healer, attacker. So if you want to stick to your roots and blow through the game dont worry about the job system. Concerns about grinding, really not alot of grinding I mean if your playing a game like this then your probably no stranger to grinding out for exp. Probably hour total throughout game grinding and most of it took place before final boss. Literally just playing through the story to the next location will give you enough exp to take on the next objective.			"

												Good game, probably could be beaten within 30-40hrs. A fair amount of grinding to level up job class and individual levels, not sure if my time in game should be taken as I had left it on a few days by accident. Worth the seasonal sale price for this classic…Yes.+interesting art style+music was continently great, but notably fantastic in Eureka+4 Dragoons using jump or a dual shielded Viking using Provoke = easy mode unlock-traveling was good as always, but odd at the end of the game where you have the final 2 flying ships and where you had to go….sometimes annoying.-Thief job class is at max Lv99….so master thief……how can they fail at stealing?Overall rating for this game 6.5/10, I would say pick it up on sale to add to your FF collection.

												Before getting down to brass tacks, one needs to be reminded that this is an old game.  A 23+ year old game, actually.  So with that in mind, there can be times when FF3 feels archaic, grindy, and vague.  This is an NES game with a new coat of paint.  So, do not expect hand holding or a cake walk.  With that out of the way...This is actually a port of a port, which usually instills fear into my heart, and while others have reported bugs, glitches, and downright unplayable circumstances, I have been lucky.  Nothing technical has disturbed my playthrough.  However, that doesn't mean the game is free from these issues.  It's kind of a, ""buy at your own risk"" sort of deal...As for the game itself.  The new paint, while cartoonish, resonates very well with me.  While in battle, I get this odd deja vu feeling, because the art design and animations resemble FF9's quite a bit.  The world is just gorgeous compared to the NES version.  The music is the original, but redone with modern technology...you know...so it matches the non 8 bit paint job.The writing, however, is atrocious.  I haven't played the original with the english fansubs, so I cannot compare the two, but this is easily B-team writing, if not C-team.  But, that's ok, because this game doesn't have a particularly good story anyway.  The story is...well...an NES story (it is basic and generic.  We don't see one of those classic Final Fantasy stories till the release of the SNES and FF4.)  If you want a good story, YOU WON""T FIND IT HERE!But what you will find here is a fun and addictive leveling system.  Oh yes, the jobs system.  See, unlike some of the later games in the series where there are more party members than we know what to do with, this game has only our 4 innocent teens.  So, instead of leveling/grinding multiple people who may represent different classes, you focus on the same four heroes but have the option of switching their class/job.  There are 23 different jobs and every character can level each of those jobs (independantly of the other characters) to level 99.  This allows for diverse parties and the ability to adapt one's party for specific situations.  It's not as awesome as the ICONIC FF5 job system, but, this came out before that...on a weaker system...with a lower production budget...and a smaller dev team...But, being simpler doesn't mean it's any less fun.As for the battles themselves.  The ATB system hasn't been invented yet.  It's oldschool turn based.  The player inputs commands for all 4 characters at the same time, and they are executed in an order detrmined by the stats of both the characters and the enemies.  Then, repeat.  This can be a good or bad thing.  It can be frustrating if your mage strattles that line of sometimes healing before the enemy attacks and sometimes after it attacks...despite being the exact same enemy.  The system can be controlled to a degree if one knows the speed of their characters...and equips gear to make the characters faster or slower.So, if one wants a TL;DR version...-It's an OLD game (1990) with a new coat of paintPros:-Seems remarkably stable despite being a port of a port.-Job system is addictive and fun.-Plenty of side quests/optional dungeons for treasure hunting.-CHALLENGING!  Unlike many new games released today where one can get through without dying, there were many sections which took me a few tries to get through.  Strategy through trial and error creates a sense of accomplishment.Cons:-Horrible writing for a non existant story (indicative of late 80's/early 90's technology and gaming scene.)-Kind of expensive for being a port...If you are looking for a nostalgic, old-school JRPG game, here you go.  It's gritty.  It certainly won't appeal to many, ""youngins,"" but if looked through the lens of the time it was released, it is a solid, and recommended experience.  8.2/10			"

												I remember playing FFIII before the DS remake. I have asked around and been told that the port to pc is basiclly the DS remake with afew additions. One the things that I enjoyed most in FFIII was the job system. It was fun to be able to change your party based on what you needed most at the time. The charcters seem to look alittle silly compared to when I first seen them but I mean it was remade for the DS so what more can you expect. I still get lost in the world and the mission. Which is the same your the chosen ones save the world. But even with that said its still a fun play through and am looking forward to some old memories just with a new paint job.			"

												I recently was having a yearning for old school JRPGs, and when I found this on steam I was overjoyed. I've played for two nights after work and I'm really enjoying this game. The story is of course a bit simple and delivered as if to children (the original target audience) but that isn't to say it isn't elegant. Couple of technical quibbles though; As some have already said though make sure before starting play the first time, go into settings in the launcher to find out (and probably change) your key bindings.The job system makes for a wonderfully diverse range of characters you can play, although I kinda wished some of the advancements you make in one class would bleed into another, so by the end of the game you have four unique individuals shaped by the selections they've made throughout the game but that's probably just the roleplayer in me. Also it would be nice If the jobs were available a *little* earlier on. The map is next to useless, which is disappointing as well, seeing as the game will say ""go to the dwarven continent"" to continue the story, but the map doesn't have any names on it, and I've found no way to move a cursor there. (I might be doing something wrong though)Despite my above petty complaints, the gameplay is simple, elegant like all early final fantasys and relaxing. Just save before each dungeon, eh?			"

												A classic RPG. Chances are that if you enjoy any RPG's at all, you'll most likely find something you like in this. This is a port of the iOS version of Final Fantasy III, so it has an upscaled 720p version of the graphics. With that being said, things still look quite primitive and blocky, and the battle arenas more often than not look like you're stood inside a disc floating in space with a jpg wrapped around it. If that kind of thing is absolutely unbearable to you, than maybe avoid this title. If you dont care too much about graphics, and you're all about the gameplay, FFIII works on a classic turn-based system, and has a classic Job system that Final Fantasy is renowned for. Character classes and archetypes are classic, recognisable and feel unique enough to make a difference in how you fight. If you've played Bravely Default, Final Fantasy 5, Final Fantasy 10-2 or even some of the Dragon Quest games, you'll feel right at home here with this classic rendition of the Job system.FF3 provides you with quite a challenge at times, especially with the bosses, and even some monsters (Lookin' at you chimera mage) Can surprise you with an attack that can wipe out your party if you're rushing too much. I'm not saying be prepared to grind for years, but if you try to charge through, you're probably going to get frustrated when you reach the next crystal boss. Some of the achievements are a serious pain, such as the 100% Beastiary and 100% Treasure achievement, due to some areas where certain monsters are missable completely, and the same is true for chests with no possibility to return to those areas. The last achievement that can be annoying is the ""Jack of All Trades"" achievement which requires you to reach Job Level 99 for every job, with every character. This is literally a matter of grinding, and even using optimal methods, it will take you several hours of mindless boredom and repetition to accomplish.Overall, aside from some of the grinding, and the graphics leaving something to be desired, I'm proud to have this title in my library, and you should be too! Fingers crossed that Square finds it within themselves to bring more and more FF titles, and other RPG's to Steam.			"

												I've purchased this game on just about every platform that it has been ported to, and I look foward to my ~10th full playthrough. Thanks to the achievements, I have an actual reason to go for a 100% completed save file, and I intend to get that. This is the first Final Fantasy game that I have played of the franchise, and it is by far my favorite. If you like turn-based rpg's, I would recommend getting this game. It is very fun and enjoyable experience that has great replayability with diverse jobs for your party to be unique. 4.5/5P.S. If you are familiar with the game Bravely Default for the Nintendo 3DS, Final Fantasy III is very similar to it. If you liked one, you 'should' like the other.			"

												If you enjoy the older Final Fantasy games then I'd recommend Final Fantasy III. Now keep in mind that this is the real Final Fantasy III (not the Super Nintendo Final Fantasy III which was actually Final Fantasy VI, but renamed FFIII since it was the third FF game to hit the US). The graphic update looks good (keep in mind that this version of FFIII was originally a Nintendo DS game). The gameplay is typical turn-based Final Fantasy gameplay. It's hard to compare to the original FFIII since it never came to the US, so I've never played it. This FF game puts an emphasis on jobs. Which determine your skill sets and which weapons/armor you can equip, but don't worry you can change your job at anytime. You also level up your jobs just like you level up your character. So the higher the job level the better you'll be at that job, and you don't lose any job levels by switching back and forth. The story is nothing special, but being from 1990 it's pretty good. Bottom line is if you like the old Final Fantasy titles (you'll need to do some grinding), and you don't mind the graphics then you'll enjoy the game.			"

												I would just like to say that, coming from someone who has thoroughly played through both the original Famicom version of this game along with the stunning remake on the Nintendo DS, seeing as this is a very well done port of the DS remake, I highly recommend this charming and enduring game to any who enjoy classic old school turn-based and storytelling action!While not a work of art like the SNES Final Fantasy games or some of the later titles, Final Fantasy III is a beautifully told and simplistic story of friendship, the concept of ""light vs dark"" and the balance of life. The battle system, while a little clunky, was very innovative at the time and still holds up today as a fun and strategic way of fighting against the monsters of darkness. The job system makes a brilliant first appearance for the first time in the series in this game and it really is such a great way for the player to place his ""stamp"" upon the game, with a large and fun variety of interesting classes and jobs to choose from at will. Again, I highly recommend this game. If you are open to its charm and simplicity, this game will draw you in and keep you engaged for hours.Rating: ""Must-own Classic""			"

												Final Fantasy III is a clunky mess. It's also kinda fun because of that, seeing as the game was released in 1990 and still holds up fairly well considering its age (Though this specific build was rolled out in 2007.) Even if it's just as a way to see some of Final Fantasy's humble beginnings, this game's still fairly enjoyable, though I'd wait until a price drop to do so, as $12 for what's effectively a repackaged Nintendo DS game is a bit pricey.Notably, this version has achievements, some of which will make you want to tear your ♥♥♥♥ing eyes out of your skull. ...So y'know, it's got that going for it.

												This is a near exact copy of the original game made for the DS.  There are a couple of small bugs in game that limit this port from reaching full potential.  However, if you loved the original on the DS or you have never played FF III than I would still recommend playing this title.  I do recommend with some hesitation only because I'm a major Final Fantasy fan.Again, I recommend this game.  But understand that it was intended originally for the Nintendo DS and with that there are some limitations.  Square could have made a few updates to the game, but the content is still there and the game is virtually unchanged.  The game does succeed at providing multiple classes for game play and a long story with moderate difficulty for players.  The story is still solid, and is still one of my favorite final fantasy games.  Hope you enjoy the adventure.			"

												This game is one of the buggiest releases I have ever played.  I keep running into situations where events re-play themselves, like seeing Cid depart the party over and over again every time I enter his town, or the dragon not appearing on Dragon's Peak even when you talk to the required NPC.  Also my Enterprise ship just disappeared after I docked it and stepped out.			"

												This is my first experience with Final Fantasy III, and I was very pleasantly surprised. Definitely reminds me of FFI, but the job system adds an interesting layer of strategy to the combat and character progression. The story may seem cliche, but FF was still relatively new at this point, and the story is incredibly deep for the NES era (in my experience, anyway). Anyway, no technical issues or bugs as of yet, so I'm looking forward to putting the beatdown on some Salamander.			"

												This game is a classic, but in my eyes also one of the most difficult and challenging JRPG's i have ever played but i was quite curious to see how the additions would benefit the game as i finished the original NES game, here are my thoughts.Pro's-Run's well, many people have been having problems playing this game so i was very thankful that i did not encounter any bugs/glitches throughout my entire playthrough.- Fleshed out characters. While i personally don't mind playing a bunch of create your own characters in a party, it was kinda of nice that each of the characters have a personality and backstory.- The cinematics look amazing! Though they are not very common, their addition is very nice indeed.- Like any other Final Fantasy game, there is a TON of extra quests/loot that is just waiting to be beaten/explored, at this point i am still grinding my way to the last few achievements (including beating the secret boss) -The Job System! It's so cool that you could try all sorts of different strategies to fight enemies and defeat bosses. I just like that they have look a little different depending on which character is using the jobCon's- Grind heavy! Thankfully having finished it before i was aware of this, i remember having to spend about 3-4 hours levellin my characters and jobs just to survive and beat some bosses so if you want to experience just the story without the extras, be preparedSo if you like JRP'S or Turn based RPG's, it should be right up your alley! I personally don't think it is worth full price, but definitely pick it up on sale and you'll get 50+ hours worth of goodness =)			"

												I think I'm kinda seeing why this game took so long to be ported.Final Fantasy III is by no means the weakest in the series. (II is worse, and there's that one later entry ... we both know which one). The combat system makes sense, the Jobs mostly make sense, and there's a forward-moving plot.Thing is, though ... it's not very interesting. It's really mostly just a selection of classic Final Fantasy tropes shuffled together and re-dealt. There's the Job system, the familiar list of spells, dungeons, the airship, elemental crystals, etc., etc., etc. It's true that some of these things actually originated here, but it kind of doesn't help? When I go back to FF1 I can see it's retro and primitive but it still has a ""freshness"" to it that FF3 lacks.All I know is, if I'm in the mood to replay a retro Final Fantasy that evokes all the old tropes like this, I'm more likely to go to FF5 for its more intricate plot and less bland characters.That said, I mean, there's nothing really WRONG here. There's nothing wrong with a bread-and-butter sandwich or a glass of plain water ... I was just kind of really hoping for a grilled cheese and Coke, y'know? So while I'm recommending the game, I'm probably not going to be playing it through more than once, ever.			"

												This remake/port of Final Fantasy III holds true to the classic 'Final Fantasy' style of play. You will get turn-based battles, random enemy encounters, various equipment/gear to choose from, and a hefty set of job choices to customize each of your heroes.Some differences from the original DS version, is that there is no friend communication. The original DS version required interaction with other players whom owned the game, to unlock extra quests. All such quests have been adapted for solo play, so there is little to no loss of game play on this remake/port version.Overall, the game is a worthwhile addition to any JRPG and/or Final Fantasy fan's collection.

												I would just like to say that, coming from someone who has thoroughly played through both the original Famicom version of this game along with the stunning remake on the Nintendo DS, seeing as this is a very well done port of the DS remake, I highly recommend this charming and enduring game to any who enjoy classic old school turn-based and storytelling action!While not a work of art like the SNES Final Fantasy games or some of the later titles, Final Fantasy III is a beautifully told and simplistic story of friendship, the concept of ""light vs dark"" and the balance of life. The battle system, while a little clunky, was very innovative at the time and still holds up today as a fun and strategic way of fighting against the monsters of darkness. The job system makes a brilliant first appearance for the first time in the series in this game and it really is such a great way for the player to place his ""stamp"" upon the game, with a large and fun variety of interesting classes and jobs to choose from at will. Again, I highly recommend this game. If you are open to its charm and simplicity, this game will draw you in and keep you engaged for hours.Rating: ""Must-own Classic""			"

												If you enjoy the older Final Fantasy games then I'd recommend Final Fantasy III. Now keep in mind that this is the real Final Fantasy III (not the Super Nintendo Final Fantasy III which was actually Final Fantasy VI, but renamed FFIII since it was the third FF game to hit the US). The graphic update looks good (keep in mind that this version of FFIII was originally a Nintendo DS game). The gameplay is typical turn-based Final Fantasy gameplay. It's hard to compare to the original FFIII since it never came to the US, so I've never played it. This FF game puts an emphasis on jobs. Which determine your skill sets and which weapons/armor you can equip, but don't worry you can change your job at anytime. You also level up your jobs just like you level up your character. So the higher the job level the better you'll be at that job, and you don't lose any job levels by switching back and forth. The story is nothing special, but being from 1990 it's pretty good. Bottom line is if you like the old Final Fantasy titles (you'll need to do some grinding), and you don't mind the graphics then you'll enjoy the game.			"

												I remember playing FFIII before the DS remake. I have asked around and been told that the port to pc is basiclly the DS remake with afew additions. One the things that I enjoyed most in FFIII was the job system. It was fun to be able to change your party based on what you needed most at the time. The charcters seem to look alittle silly compared to when I first seen them but I mean it was remade for the DS so what more can you expect. I still get lost in the world and the mission. Which is the same your the chosen ones save the world. But even with that said its still a fun play through and am looking forward to some old memories just with a new paint job.			"

												I recently was having a yearning for old school JRPGs, and when I found this on steam I was overjoyed. I've played for two nights after work and I'm really enjoying this game. The story is of course a bit simple and delivered as if to children (the original target audience) but that isn't to say it isn't elegant. Couple of technical quibbles though; As some have already said though make sure before starting play the first time, go into settings in the launcher to find out (and probably change) your key bindings.The job system makes for a wonderfully diverse range of characters you can play, although I kinda wished some of the advancements you make in one class would bleed into another, so by the end of the game you have four unique individuals shaped by the selections they've made throughout the game but that's probably just the roleplayer in me. Also it would be nice If the jobs were available a *little* earlier on. The map is next to useless, which is disappointing as well, seeing as the game will say ""go to the dwarven continent"" to continue the story, but the map doesn't have any names on it, and I've found no way to move a cursor there. (I might be doing something wrong though)Despite my above petty complaints, the gameplay is simple, elegant like all early final fantasys and relaxing. Just save before each dungeon, eh?			"

												After playing FF7/8/10/11/etc I finally decided to give number III a go. Nice game even though the graphics are out-dated nowadays. Doesn't feel too difficult so far, and naturally some Grinding is in the works. I would've liked the port to be a little bit better where some features (bestiary for example) are featured in the menu, instead of talking to a NPC. Don't buy this at the full price though, it's overpriced in my opinion.			"

												Although the dialogue and story is rather simple in comparison to the modern FF games, this is still a very strong entry in the series.The game remains entertaining and challenging throughout the ~30hr story, and although there is an annoyingly large difficulty jump for the final boss which requires a lot of grinding, the job system and abundance of side-missions keep things fresh.It's not particularly pretty, being a port of a Nintendo DS remake, but is playable in almost any resolution and the soundtrack is one of the best of any FF game I've played.Absolutely recommended for any fan of the FF series, or JRPG's in general.

												Good game, probably could be beaten within 30-40hrs. A fair amount of grinding to level up job class and individual levels, not sure if my time in game should be taken as I had left it on a few days by accident. Worth the seasonal sale price for this classic…Yes.+interesting art style+music was continently great, but notably fantastic in Eureka+4 Dragoons using jump or a dual shielded Viking using Provoke = easy mode unlock-traveling was good as always, but odd at the end of the game where you have the final 2 flying ships and where you had to go….sometimes annoying.-Thief job class is at max Lv99….so master thief……how can they fail at stealing?Overall rating for this game 6.5/10, I would say pick it up on sale to add to your FF collection.

												A classic RPG. Chances are that if you enjoy any RPG's at all, you'll most likely find something you like in this. This is a port of the iOS version of Final Fantasy III, so it has an upscaled 720p version of the graphics. With that being said, things still look quite primitive and blocky, and the battle arenas more often than not look like you're stood inside a disc floating in space with a jpg wrapped around it. If that kind of thing is absolutely unbearable to you, than maybe avoid this title. If you dont care too much about graphics, and you're all about the gameplay, FFIII works on a classic turn-based system, and has a classic Job system that Final Fantasy is renowned for. Character classes and archetypes are classic, recognisable and feel unique enough to make a difference in how you fight. If you've played Bravely Default, Final Fantasy 5, Final Fantasy 10-2 or even some of the Dragon Quest games, you'll feel right at home here with this classic rendition of the Job system.FF3 provides you with quite a challenge at times, especially with the bosses, and even some monsters (Lookin' at you chimera mage) Can surprise you with an attack that can wipe out your party if you're rushing too much. I'm not saying be prepared to grind for years, but if you try to charge through, you're probably going to get frustrated when you reach the next crystal boss. Some of the achievements are a serious pain, such as the 100% Beastiary and 100% Treasure achievement, due to some areas where certain monsters are missable completely, and the same is true for chests with no possibility to return to those areas. The last achievement that can be annoying is the ""Jack of All Trades"" achievement which requires you to reach Job Level 99 for every job, with every character. This is literally a matter of grinding, and even using optimal methods, it will take you several hours of mindless boredom and repetition to accomplish.Overall, aside from some of the grinding, and the graphics leaving something to be desired, I'm proud to have this title in my library, and you should be too! Fingers crossed that Square finds it within themselves to bring more and more FF titles, and other RPG's to Steam.			"

												Before getting down to brass tacks, one needs to be reminded that this is an old game.  A 23+ year old game, actually.  So with that in mind, there can be times when FF3 feels archaic, grindy, and vague.  This is an NES game with a new coat of paint.  So, do not expect hand holding or a cake walk.  With that out of the way...This is actually a port of a port, which usually instills fear into my heart, and while others have reported bugs, glitches, and downright unplayable circumstances, I have been lucky.  Nothing technical has disturbed my playthrough.  However, that doesn't mean the game is free from these issues.  It's kind of a, ""buy at your own risk"" sort of deal...As for the game itself.  The new paint, while cartoonish, resonates very well with me.  While in battle, I get this odd deja vu feeling, because the art design and animations resemble FF9's quite a bit.  The world is just gorgeous compared to the NES version.  The music is the original, but redone with modern technology...you know...so it matches the non 8 bit paint job.The writing, however, is atrocious.  I haven't played the original with the english fansubs, so I cannot compare the two, but this is easily B-team writing, if not C-team.  But, that's ok, because this game doesn't have a particularly good story anyway.  The story is...well...an NES story (it is basic and generic.  We don't see one of those classic Final Fantasy stories till the release of the SNES and FF4.)  If you want a good story, YOU WON""T FIND IT HERE!But what you will find here is a fun and addictive leveling system.  Oh yes, the jobs system.  See, unlike some of the later games in the series where there are more party members than we know what to do with, this game has only our 4 innocent teens.  So, instead of leveling/grinding multiple people who may represent different classes, you focus on the same four heroes but have the option of switching their class/job.  There are 23 different jobs and every character can level each of those jobs (independantly of the other characters) to level 99.  This allows for diverse parties and the ability to adapt one's party for specific situations.  It's not as awesome as the ICONIC FF5 job system, but, this came out before that...on a weaker system...with a lower production budget...and a smaller dev team...But, being simpler doesn't mean it's any less fun.As for the battles themselves.  The ATB system hasn't been invented yet.  It's oldschool turn based.  The player inputs commands for all 4 characters at the same time, and they are executed in an order detrmined by the stats of both the characters and the enemies.  Then, repeat.  This can be a good or bad thing.  It can be frustrating if your mage strattles that line of sometimes healing before the enemy attacks and sometimes after it attacks...despite being the exact same enemy.  The system can be controlled to a degree if one knows the speed of their characters...and equips gear to make the characters faster or slower.So, if one wants a TL;DR version...-It's an OLD game (1990) with a new coat of paintPros:-Seems remarkably stable despite being a port of a port.-Job system is addictive and fun.-Plenty of side quests/optional dungeons for treasure hunting.-CHALLENGING!  Unlike many new games released today where one can get through without dying, there were many sections which took me a few tries to get through.  Strategy through trial and error creates a sense of accomplishment.Cons:-Horrible writing for a non existant story (indicative of late 80's/early 90's technology and gaming scene.)-Kind of expensive for being a port...If you are looking for a nostalgic, old-school JRPG game, here you go.  It's gritty.  It certainly won't appeal to many, ""youngins,"" but if looked through the lens of the time it was released, it is a solid, and recommended experience.  8.2/10			"

For this reason, it's probably the most underapreciated Final Fantasy.It's main contribution to the series was the introduction of the job system, but it's overshadowed in that department by the far superior FF5.

												Despite the updated graphics, this is very much an old school JRPG. Which isn't a problem, per se, but something one should be aware of going in. Because of the class system and lack of clear distinctions in much of the equipment there is a *lot* of equipment management. Death is a pain, as Phoenix Downs are rare and while I assume there's a Life spell at some point, it certainly doesn't make an early appearance. A Quicksave option has been added, so at least you can leave the game in a hurry without losing progress, but you're still primarily dependent on world map saves (because there *aren't* any save points in the dungeons >.<).

												I was never interested in Final Fantasy 3 before, I always thought it would be bad, but my husband baught it for me to give it and chance because I thought it looked good and LOVE it, it is a great game. It has flaws like: You can't buy Phoenix Downs so until you can get to a revive well you have to rely on the ones you have found or not die, and reise magic is a level 5 spell. Magic is not based on Mana but you have a set amount of casts, they upgrade with your job levels but I perfer the mana method. The story and people you talk to don't always tell you where to go next and the map isn't labeled, and like all the other early Final Fantasy games you have to spend a bit of time grinding or get destroyed but I find that makes them more interesting. What I liked the most is the graphics I think they are well done, The fact that you get your 4 characters VERY early so you don't have 1 or 2 characters that are much higher then the others, the NPC's are interesting, this game introduced Moogle Mail which I find to be a great part of other games (Love those moogles) the jobs, I have only gotten the first set so far yet, but they are great, the characters look good in them and they are quite powerful. All in all it is a great game and a great buy, well worth $15.00.			"

												I have never played FF III before so when I saw it on Steam I decided to pick it up.  I have an xbox controller hooked up to the PC and the game automatically mapped the buttons which is nice.  The game itself reminds me of some aspects of the original final fantasy (such as buying spells, normal enemies being able to instant kill you, etc) and something like Bravely Default where you can change your characters jobs freely throughout the game. The game is challenging without being cheap.  Anyone who hasn't played FF III before and likes JRPG should pick this up			"

												Very good so far! I never got to play the real III, due to not having a DS or whatever handheld platform it was finally released for, so I'm glad it came to steam! Loving the job system and the variability you can play with. It's a great rush of nostalgia to come back and play a classic like this one.			"

												As a final fantasy fan, this review should be biased. The game is fun and fairly similiar to other releases, but if you do not own it or waiting for pc version as I have then it is worth the buy. The job system has always been an awesome system and such fond memories playing it again here. The graphics are pretty good, although i do not see the improvements other thanwhat came with the port.  This game would be highly recommended if they could fix the controller issues. Logitech rumblepad 2 does not work. Xbox 360 wireless works great if connected prior to game starting until the moment the battery dies in which case the game loses all functionality from keyboard or controller use.			"

												Final Fantasy III is probably one of my favourite games ever. The amount of customization [279,841 different combinations [presuming order is important]] is incredible, and you can play the game pretty much any way you like. While the characters and story may not be as compelling as other RPGs, for sheer gameplay and replayability, this game wins out over most.			"

												Before getting down to brass tacks, one needs to be reminded that this is an old game.  A 23+ year old game, actually.  So with that in mind, there can be times when FF3 feels archaic, grindy, and vague.  This is an NES game with a new coat of paint.  So, do not expect hand holding or a cake walk.  With that out of the way...This is actually a port of a port, which usually instills fear into my heart, and while others have reported bugs, glitches, and downright unplayable circumstances, I have been lucky.  Nothing technical has disturbed my playthrough.  However, that doesn't mean the game is free from these issues.  It's kind of a, ""buy at your own risk"" sort of deal...As for the game itself.  The new paint, while cartoonish, resonates very well with me.  While in battle, I get this odd deja vu feeling, because the art design and animations resemble FF9's quite a bit.  The world is just gorgeous compared to the NES version.  The music is the original, but redone with modern technology...you know...so it matches the non 8 bit paint job.The writing, however, is atrocious.  I haven't played the original with the english fansubs, so I cannot compare the two, but this is easily B-team writing, if not C-team.  But, that's ok, because this game doesn't have a particularly good story anyway.  The story is...well...an NES story (it is basic and generic.  We don't see one of those classic Final Fantasy stories till the release of the SNES and FF4.)  If you want a good story, YOU WON""T FIND IT HERE!But what you will find here is a fun and addictive leveling system.  Oh yes, the jobs system.  See, unlike some of the later games in the series where there are more party members than we know what to do with, this game has only our 4 innocent teens.  So, instead of leveling/grinding multiple people who may represent different classes, you focus on the same four heroes but have the option of switching their class/job.  There are 23 different jobs and every character can level each of those jobs (independantly of the other characters) to level 99.  This allows for diverse parties and the ability to adapt one's party for specific situations.  It's not as awesome as the ICONIC FF5 job system, but, this came out before that...on a weaker system...with a lower production budget...and a smaller dev team...But, being simpler doesn't mean it's any less fun.As for the battles themselves.  The ATB system hasn't been invented yet.  It's oldschool turn based.  The player inputs commands for all 4 characters at the same time, and they are executed in an order detrmined by the stats of both the characters and the enemies.  Then, repeat.  This can be a good or bad thing.  It can be frustrating if your mage strattles that line of sometimes healing before the enemy attacks and sometimes after it attacks...despite being the exact same enemy.  The system can be controlled to a degree if one knows the speed of their characters...and equips gear to make the characters faster or slower.So, if one wants a TL;DR version...-It's an OLD game (1990) with a new coat of paintPros:-Seems remarkably stable despite being a port of a port.-Job system is addictive and fun.-Plenty of side quests/optional dungeons for treasure hunting.-CHALLENGING!  Unlike many new games released today where one can get through without dying, there were many sections which took me a few tries to get through.  Strategy through trial and error creates a sense of accomplishment.Cons:-Horrible writing for a non existant story (indicative of late 80's/early 90's technology and gaming scene.)-Kind of expensive for being a port...If you are looking for a nostalgic, old-school JRPG game, here you go.  It's gritty.  It certainly won't appeal to many, ""youngins,"" but if looked through the lens of the time it was released, it is a solid, and recommended experience.  8.2/10			"

												Although the dialogue and story is rather simple in comparison to the modern FF games, this is still a very strong entry in the series.The game remains entertaining and challenging throughout the ~30hr story, and although there is an annoyingly large difficulty jump for the final boss which requires a lot of grinding, the job system and abundance of side-missions keep things fresh.It's not particularly pretty, being a port of a Nintendo DS remake, but is playable in almost any resolution and the soundtrack is one of the best of any FF game I've played.Absolutely recommended for any fan of the FF series, or JRPG's in general.

												The game is combination of great mythos, challenge, story and cute. it is hard to believe this game first come out to NES of all consoles and now that it has been upgrated to new platform it has brought all the great ideas they had into entire new dimensions. we must consider the game as it first was in its original form, which leads us to even greater hights, considering how right down terrible some of the games in NES library are (not including the handful of classics that were actually good) how hard it must have been back than if even today it can make you grind your nerves while you are grinding for EXP. in a world of today where graphics are photorealistic and stories greater than movies and tv shows, its good to sit down with a game like this to greet something bit older in a new skin. I do recommend to check it out.			"

As it is the next game in the series after 1 and 2, you'd think the antagonist would actually be involved for most of the game, yet, CoD is just kind of thrown in there. Character development was actually a bit lackluster in comparison to even FF2. Gameplay wise, fairly decent. "

Great class system, typical FF Crystal story, hidden items and chest, a bit of grind. Great for those looking for a classic JRPGStoryLike in the original Final Fantasy III you play as the four Onion Knights: Luneth, Arc, Refia and Butts. These guys were basically created to give the onion knights a sense of individual character and design. Anyway you start the story off with amnesia in typical JRPG fashion, you fight some monsters in a cave and then get told you're the chosen one. You gather your four party members within the first two-three hours and then you're off saving the flying continent from Xande using the power of the four crystals. The story is incredibly weak, but that's not why you're here.   Battle Mechanics and GameplayDon't go into this expecting anything complex, it's a classic JRPG It uses a turn based system setup like so:AttackClass Abilities/MagicGuardItems Flee (If available)Grinding isn't too necessary if you're not fleeing every encounter and if you have set strategies for the bosses, but this is only if you'e hunting hidden chests for hidden equipment. However grinding is incredibly viable if you're looking to 100% the game. Turns are purely based on characters attack speeds, there is no ATB in this game. SoundSoundtrack really isn't too memorable aside from the battle themes, chocobo theme and the dancer themes. Not much Choice and FreedomsThis game boasts a unique 23 classes all with their own different playstyles, to go along with the boatload of classes to choose from you also have a heavy amount of character customization, classes are not limited to just one weapon type, you have access to over a hundred weapons and armor throughout the game. This game really treats you with the variety of equipment and class builds.  Exploration in dungeons and the overworld will benefit you as you'll find alot of hidden loot, but the story progression is incredibly linear.			"

												Final Fantasy III is an old school j-rpg with remade graphics. Recommending this game will depend on your ability to appreciate game design from the early 90s. To be more specific quest design, encounter design and story are all barebones. Quests consist of going somewhere, kill someone, get an object, advance. There are very few sidequests, and exploration is limited due to the size of the world map and the convenience of transportation. That is not necessarily a flaw, as the game still has a good amount of content, and ends up more focused. Except at the end, you won't get lost or stumble in the wrong places, which comes at the price of fulfilling exploration.Level design abuses the use of secret corridors. Basically some corridors are hidden behind fake walls, and completely dark, so you have to stumble across them. Also you often have to backtrack if you want to get every nook and cranny. Other than that it's basic but effective. The encounters are repetitive and lack the needs of strategy to solve them, you basically brute force through everything, as you seldom run out of ressources if you are well prepared. With that said, they still are satisfying because you can't save in dungeons, and as you advance the tension rises. That is, if you go into dungeons casually and unprepared, because otherwise the game becomes a cakewalk.The story is minimal, but like it's graphics it has a cutesy kind of charm. Characters have no development, the story bends to accomodate for the gameplay, if you rely on a good story to carry your experience you will find it severely lacking here and I would advise you against this game.Overall I found the game rewarding to finish, and I would recommend it on that ground. I like that you can choose whatever classes you like from a pool of 20+ jobs, I like the charming simplicity of this game, and I found it to be effective in what it sets to be. But I wouldn't recommend it for people who have modern standards, as the game clearly doesn't meet them.			"

												FFIII is quite a fun game, but with some warnings. The gameplay is terribly slow by today's standards, and some jobs are not as balanced as others. However, this DS port oozes charm, and a few mods can make the gameplay speed up to a reasonable rate. If you are new to the FF series, try a higher numbered title, but if you are a completionist like me, you'll enjoy it greatly.			"

												It is truly a pleasure for the long-time fan of Final Fantasy titles on the Playstation to be able to play through classic games such as this in a reworked state. As much as it is a pleasant feeling of nostalgia to play them once again on a SNES, seeing some of the older games remade in such a way is really great--having them come to Steam is even better.Don't be fooled by the slightly child-like visuals (they were, after all made for the DS and then subsequently mobile OSs). Final Fantasy III is an old-school RPG. The vast majority of the game remains what it was on the SNES to the core. It is unforgiving; there is very rarely a save-point before a boss. For those who remember these frustrating but extremely rewarding games with fondness, you will not be disappointed with Final Fantasy III. Some things about the old school, however, are not so great. Attacking a fire-elemental monster with fire and having it simply hurt them 'less' rather than outright healing them, appears to be a feature that Square-Enix probably should have tweaked before re-releasing this game, but I can forgive them--after all, as I said it *does* hurt them less...The story is basic, as one would expect of an RPG of its age. Square Enix added a little bit of character development into the reworked version that at least helps to better differentiate the characters from one another. Nonetheless, if you wish to play for storyline rather than the excellent RPG combat mechanics that made Final Fantasy the definitive title in turn-based RPGs, then you may wish to look to the newer titles in the series now available on Steam, such as VII, VIII, and soon to be XIII. I would certainly recommend this game to any Final Fantasy fan. Beyond that, however, I'm not sure I could recommend it. There are far better RPGs out there on the market and often at a similar price. The later titles in the Final Fantasy series, the Elder Scrolls, and Bioware's many titles are typically superior to this one if you plan on throwing 30+ hours into a game. As a fan of Final Fantasy, though, I enjoyed it. 8/10.			"

												Final Fantasy III is a clunky mess. It's also kinda fun because of that, seeing as the game was released in 1990 and still holds up fairly well considering its age (Though this specific build was rolled out in 2007.) Even if it's just as a way to see some of Final Fantasy's humble beginnings, this game's still fairly enjoyable, though I'd wait until a price drop to do so, as $12 for what's effectively a repackaged Nintendo DS game is a bit pricey.Notably, this version has achievements, some of which will make you want to tear your ♥♥♥♥ing eyes out of your skull. ...So y'know, it's got that going for it.

If these issues are fixed I will change this reveiw to positive since underneath it all it is a good game just a really badly ported one.(edit) Having completed the game the thing is it is a very good game overall (with the exception of the final dungeon seriously you wanna grind about 10 more levels for it) there is a lot of enjoyment you can get from this game but if youre looking to buy it I would recomend the 3ds port of the game instead. changing reveiw to positive due to the quality of the inherent game but this port is still a bad one.

												This was my first time playing this game since the town I lived in didn't have FF games on the count of I lived too far north.  However, thanks to technology and Steam, I can relive what I missed as a youth.Amazing game for its time.... I would have likely enjoyed it a lot more if I would have gotten it when it was released... which I was like 10 years old back then.  Anyways, the game works fine, the port is really good too, however, some options are not available like the option to mute the game's sounds.  I rpefer to listen to the radio when playing.I got this on sale and not sure I'd pay more than sale price for a 25 year old game.Still, it outshines some brand new games I paid more for.Would I play it again?  Maybe once I get 1 & 2, to do a whole FF marathon but in this day in age, I rather play games with top notch graphics.  This still has the 1990's graphics... despite that, an oldie, but a goodie.  I'd definitely buy a remastered version of this.			"

												If you like the Final Fantasy franchise, you will love this one. It looks like the colors have been updated and the gameplay is a little bit more clear. I started with game 7 in the Final Fantasy franchise and I love this one almost as much. I can see where a lot of the story and the enemies from 7 have been influenced by 3. The weird thing I had to get used to was this notion of ""jobs"", sort of like different fighting classes. From Freelancer (?) to  the Mages, The Warriors and the Stealth, the game morphs more into different jobs as the bosses get harder and as the characters progress. Each ""job"" comes with it's own perks, weaponry and armor and some are more powerful than others. All in all, I really love this game and it's a nostalgic throwback to Link to the Past as far as map play is concerned.			"

												I only recommend this game to you if you enjoy late 80's console RPGs. It contains remixed graphics and soundtrack, but at its core, it is a punishing, old-school game. If you need to change character jobs or get stuck on a boss, be prepared to spend some time level grinding. On a lighter note, if you have too much trouble in the game, you can abuse the autosaving mechanic right before you get a game over by quitting and restarting. In summary, if you like the Final Fantasy series, it's worth playing, although I would advise getting it at a discount unless you know for sure you want this. If you aren't sold on the older mechanics and want to play one with an Active Time Battle system that the classic series is known for, I recommend Final Fantasy IV, V, or VI. I haven't played them on Steam, but their source games are excellent.			"

												FF 3 is a standard JRPG. You'll be playing a port of a port of the original game. You'll get some updated graphics and the likes, but you can expect the core to be there from the same game. You can expect about a 20-25 hour game if you play just the story, maybe some more if you go for anything more. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants the nostalgia , or anyone who's interested in seeing the origins of the FF game. If those don't interest you, you might be best off getting a more recent FF.			"

												What can I say about FF3 in just a few sentences? The combat is fun. The game itself is challenging. Job versatility is an amazing aspect. The port looks nice. If you like other Final Fantasy games, you'll more than likely enjoy this one as well.			"

												This game is one of the buggiest releases I have ever played.  I keep running into situations where events re-play themselves, like seeing Cid depart the party over and over again every time I enter his town, or the dragon not appearing on Dragon's Peak even when you talk to the required NPC.  Also my Enterprise ship just disappeared after I docked it and stepped out.			"

Bosses on hard difficulty can be a challenge without grinding, but not daunting.  I am having a really pleasant experience with FFIII.  I also really love the job system.

Makes you think that you can do it and you immediatley regrets you for thinking that way.For instance, when thoughts before boss battling in my head:I can beat this boss because the monster in this zone are no match for me!I got a lot of pheonix downs, potions and a White mage?He's fire right, Ice can surely can beat it right?And the thoughts During the Boss fights:Effe me I should have grind more!He can Atk Twice?Almost Instantly killed the Warrior Glad I am glad I have a Freaking White mage!I Just wasted A pheonix down!Aughh, Why does everyone have to die so Quickly!?Stop Killing the White mage, Atk the Warrior Dammit, are you not annoyed at him for poking you!?Armor is Useless, I rather go naked!

But anyway, it's not like it's that good, but it's FF.  The story is the most basic cliche stuff, graphics are basic, gameplay is yawn etc. etc. but you can't be mad when it's that moment when you finally get blizzaga, right?Lots of grinding, lots of where do I go now, lots of noob (this area is way too hard) traps, but hey.

												Final Fantasy III, Let me start off by saying I have always seen this series, admired the concepts and design, but have never actually played them. I am a huge fan of JRPGs and for the price I would recommend picking this up.             There are a few downsides however that might promote investing in a different JRPG. The overall story is very linier, generic. YOU WILL GRIND. Grinding is a pretty huge part in this game. You can go from losing a party member to overwhelming victories in just a few levels, forces you to grind easy monsters when you get the chance. There is an open(ish) world, and tons of hidden areas and items. This promotes exploration during the grinding, but wander too far and meet your doom, keeps it interesting. The Job (class) system is relatively extensive as well allowing for around 20 different jobs including some “hidden” jobs and unlockables throughout the game.            All in all if you are interested in the Final Fantasy series this is enjoyable, playable, beatable, not the best JRPG of all time but a nice one.			"

												I recommend this game to fans of the Final Fantasy series. Newcomers I would warn off and advise playing one of the other titles in the series before considering this one. Its a fine game, on the face of it simple and inviting, there are a few features though that mean I would not recommend for new players.The job system is good fun, I had encountered it before playing Final Fantasy Tactics on the PSP so was familiar with it, but as I'm playing through I'm learning more about the intricacies of it. There is very little guidance in how the different jobs work, quite a lot of guesswork is involved without visiting guides on the Community or FFWiki. There is also a fair amount of grinding involved, some of the bosses and dungeons are a real step up (currently levelling up for one of them!)Fianlly, in my opinion the story is not the best. By no means is it a bad story, in fact I'm enjoying the quest of the Warriors of Light. I just can't help but feel they could haave had a bit more personality about them, you don' really get to see them interact with each other very much so you don't get much insight into their personalities.That all said, if you like the series I'd grab this (advise waiting for 33/50% sale) as a lot of stuff from this game was original when it came out in the 90s and has been well restored for this DS version.

												Being the first game in the FF series I've played, I definitely enjoyed it a lot. Yeah, there's the grinding and the random encounters; but that comes with the package, it's a classic. I haven't played any other FF game, so there's nothing for me to really compare it to. At times while I was playing, I forgot why I was doing something; it had a pretty weak story and I didn't find it that interesting but I liked the ending. I found the jobs system really interesting as I've never seen anything like it. To finish the core story, it would take nowhere near the playtime I have; but I went for the mastery (getting all chests and completing the bestiary). If you want to do that, then it'll take a tad bit longer; even so, there's amazing guides to help you with it and I found it fun. I plan to go on playing FF4 after this; so if you're planning on playing through the FF series, this is a great place to start IMO.			"

If these issues are fixed I will change this reveiw to positive since underneath it all it is a good game just a really badly ported one.(edit) Having completed the game the thing is it is a very good game overall (with the exception of the final dungeon seriously you wanna grind about 10 more levels for it) there is a lot of enjoyment you can get from this game but if youre looking to buy it I would recomend the 3ds port of the game instead. changing reveiw to positive due to the quality of the inherent game but this port is still a bad one.

												FF 3 is a standard JRPG. You'll be playing a port of a port of the original game. You'll get some updated graphics and the likes, but you can expect the core to be there from the same game. You can expect about a 20-25 hour game if you play just the story, maybe some more if you go for anything more. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants the nostalgia , or anyone who's interested in seeing the origins of the FF game. If those don't interest you, you might be best off getting a more recent FF.			"

Great class system, typical FF Crystal story, hidden items and chest, a bit of grind. Great for those looking for a classic JRPGStoryLike in the original Final Fantasy III you play as the four Onion Knights: Luneth, Arc, Refia and Butts. These guys were basically created to give the onion knights a sense of individual character and design. Anyway you start the story off with amnesia in typical JRPG fashion, you fight some monsters in a cave and then get told you're the chosen one. You gather your four party members within the first two-three hours and then you're off saving the flying continent from Xande using the power of the four crystals. The story is incredibly weak, but that's not why you're here.   Battle Mechanics and GameplayDon't go into this expecting anything complex, it's a classic JRPG It uses a turn based system setup like so:AttackClass Abilities/MagicGuardItems Flee (If available)Grinding isn't too necessary if you're not fleeing every encounter and if you have set strategies for the bosses, but this is only if you'e hunting hidden chests for hidden equipment. However grinding is incredibly viable if you're looking to 100% the game. Turns are purely based on characters attack speeds, there is no ATB in this game. SoundSoundtrack really isn't too memorable aside from the battle themes, chocobo theme and the dancer themes. Not much Choice and FreedomsThis game boasts a unique 23 classes all with their own different playstyles, to go along with the boatload of classes to choose from you also have a heavy amount of character customization, classes are not limited to just one weapon type, you have access to over a hundred weapons and armor throughout the game. This game really treats you with the variety of equipment and class builds.  Exploration in dungeons and the overworld will benefit you as you'll find alot of hidden loot, but the story progression is incredibly linear.			"

												At long last I finally get to play the one Final Fantasy Title I have never been able to play before.The game revolves around the classic styled Final Fantasy, where you can pick your jobs and level them upbut also includes a final fantasy II styled battle system. Where the more you level up a job instead of a weapon this timethe better you become with it and can deal more damage.The story overall is a bit sluggish although, still all together pretty decent.I really did enjoy the game and felt accomplished once I beat it. Being able to seethe ending after waiting all these years to play it.Final thoughts? Its worth it, it was worth the wait and its worth the price tag.If you are a Final Fantasy fan it is definitly one for the collection.			"

												Although this is my first approach to the Final Fantasy Series (I wanted it to be FFI, and Kingdom Hearts and Children of Mana do not count) I wouldn't be happier with that decission. Not very familiarized with JRPGs, FFIII is great for anyone who loves JRPGs or wants to try one out. The story is easy to follow and well developed throughout the whole game. What I find a little tedious is perhaps to level up all character to lv 99 in every single job; but I guess that's the whole point. Proggressively difficult monsters and bosses that require that you carefully level up your party and it's relatively difficult to 100% this game. Definitely recommended and it is now in one of my favorite games. Can't wait to play the rest of the Final Fantasies!!!			"

Posted: February 18, 2015
												First off - I'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series, so I might be a little biased because of that.So what makes this game good? In my opinion it's the job system and a fantastic world is the main strengths of this game. The job system allows the party characters to switch between classes (like warrior, monk, black mage, etc.) giving them access to a variety of skills and equipment unique to each class and each job can be leveled up alongside the characters' ""normal"" level.The world is vast and has a good variety of towns, caves and temples. Without spoiling too much it's also wonderful that the world is a lot bigger than you might initially think.As for the gameplay it's a fairly traditional JRPG - especially if you've been playing the older FF games before. It's a turn-based battle system that allows the faster characters or enemies to strike first when commands are selected. You do have all the time you want to select commands, though, meaning there is time to be strategic.While not overly difficult, you'll have to grind once in a while if you want to be strong enough to progress. I'm not going to put that down as a positive or negative thing as that is very much up to the individual. It's especially important in late game, though, and crucial if you're planning to take on some of the games optional bosses.If you're looking to go for a Perfect Game (obtain all achievements) you should be prepared to grind relentlessly as some of the achievements here are incredibly time-consuming.If I'm not mistaken this is a port of the iOS version (which is more or less identical to the DS version), which means updated graphics. It's not beautiful, but it has a certain charm to it - and it's definitely an upgrade from the original graphics.The soundtrack also deserves a mention - it's good. As in really good. It contains revamped versions of Nobuo Uematsu's original compositions for the NES version of the game - I haven't heard the originals myself, so I can't compare, but the new versions are definitely solid.My main gripe with this game is the characters, though. There's so memorable NPCs but the party characters are pretty boring and with only a little background story to each. Even though more is revealed later in the game it's still not particularly satisfying.The story isn't anything out of the ordinary either, although it isn't downright bad. If you've played older Final Fantasy-games before it's pretty much a classic ""save the world using crystals""-story.But besides a boring cast of party characters and a somewhat bland story, the game is still worthwhile if you're into more old-school JRPGs and don't mind the updated graphics. The gameplay, job system and the world are magnificent and should entertain most RPG-fans enough to make this a worthwhile purchase. Don't expect it to be as story-rich and complex as later entries in the Final Fantasy series, though.			"

												 I played Final Fantasy on the original NES I think around 98 (?)then nothing til FF7, so originally I missed this one in 1994.  The more recent (not modern, but nicely updated) graphics made the game playable.I'd forgotten how pre 2000 games were and man was this one an education.   If you lose track of quests you either ask every NPC hoping they have advice, perform a grid search of all your playable area, or nowadays ask Mr. Google because nothing is spoonfed.  There are no quest logs or map markers.  If you forget to save, that could be hours of gameplay down the drain from a single mistake.  Towards the end there is no opportunity to save within an hour of the main boss other than a quicksave.  It is handy if you want to take a play break because you can return to it  once but then it is erased, so no saves near the boss to allow try over and over til you win with no added work.  All in all it is a hard ride after playing games that nudge you towards your destination for so many years.  Winning was enough to cause a fist pump and a yesssss... followed by an odd look from my wife who probably figured I was having an episode of some sort.			"

												Final Fantasy III is a classic JRPG. Tons of sidequests, open-world style game with the mission to save the world from the darkness as the four warriors of light. The story was average, however, the characters were neat, and I liked the several job classes you could use as well as the versatility it provided. My personal ""issue"" with this game is that the story is basically the same thing as Final Fantasy I. In fact, it's the exact same just a different world. So while the story gets no points here for originality, the game itself is pretty old and this is just a port of the DS version of the game, and the original came on the NES. Take it as you will; It's a great game and time killer.			"

												This game makes me even more proud to be a PC gamer. Final Fantasy is quite possibly my favorite game series ever to exist, and to be able to play III on my main entertainment system is the best. Now if only the other Final Fantasy games could come to steam. I'd drop all the $ signs to see the other ones on here so I could replay them endlessly just like I used too.Note: I always hear, why do you like Final Fantasy so much? there are too many to follow...Each final fantasy is a different story with different characters and different in game mechanics which make it all worth while following each and every game. I grew up with these games, and 15 years later the games still are just as fun and amazing as ever.			"

												This game is hard! No save points in dungeons, so the endgame is one heck of a gauntlet to run. Also character deaths in battle is a lot more unforgiving cause you can't buy Phoenix downs or elixirs, either. Without spoiling anything, there are also some parts of the game where you will be forced to change your party's jobs into a mage team, too. Finally, you -will- have to grind a lot in this game. Like, significantly more than later games in the series, which also disguise some of their grinding with side quests and other content rather than just a massive enemy difficulty spike when you set foot in a new area.The story is a lot more sparse, but it's okay. Final Fantasy 1-3 didn't really have much in the way of stories. I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for getting into the series (unless you just want to start with arguably the most difficult title and can get through the increased amount of battle difficulty and grinding in the game), but once you've played some of them, it's worth checking out.

												Great game! More suited to old time rpg gamers though. A lot of grinding. Didn't notice the bugs that others were mentioning on here.			"

												I bought this expecting the graphics to suck, and I was dissappointed, they are actually better than I thought they would be. Also, SAVE OFTEN, in the first area alone there are at least 3 monsters that will completely wipe out your party right out of the gate: Berserkers, Werewolves, and Mummies. Grind a lot, that is the only way to survive, the first cave is a good place to start because everything goes down with 1 or 2 hits and only hits you for a couple points of damage.			"

												Initially I gave FFIII and FFIV a poor review as they wouldnt launch due to the launcher making use of some qt5 dlls. I finaly remedied it by injecting a new DNSAPI.dll into the system32 directory...Cant wait to get into these titles.			"

												I recently started playing the Final Fantasy series.  I started with XIII, XIII-2 and Lightning Returns.  I liked them so much i decided to buy the old ""remade version"" ones from steam.  I intend to play them in order, so far i'm over 20 hours into this final fantasy and it's been a blast.  No wonder these games have such reviews, you can lose yourself in this games and you completly lose track of times.			"

												Had to post as I was hesitant about getting the game breaking bugs were talking about, received absolutely none through an entire playthrough of the game over the last 2 weeks. They all must be doing something in common or using some sort of common controller that's causing the same error.Great game, good port, get the mod for resolution though so the menus don't take up the entire screen!

												Initially, I didn't know that this port was based on the DS version, and was almost inclined to give it a horrible review due to graphics and (some) loading times.While both of the above elements make the game seem far, FAR more dated than a complete-game overhaul (or even a spritzed-up sprite-based version ought to be), the gameplay and story still hold up. In fact, some of the translation updates actively *help* the overall experience at only a minor expense to the nostalgic value.FF3 on Steam is pretty darn good.			"

												I really love this game. I remember playing it as a child, so it's a pretty nostalgia-inducing game. I know that it is a much simpler game, but I don't think that detours from the gameplay that is experienced. The one thing that I forgot, and took me a little bit to remember, you can only save on the overworld. I think the game has a little bit of a difficulty curve to it compared to other games, but grinding a little before each of the major bosses really helps. It's also not hard to tell when the bosses are coming up next so you are able to tell when you need to start grinding. I've read of other people having glitches. I have not had a glitch yet, so maybe I'm just lucky.			"

												Let me start by saying I'm a bit biased, I've been a fan of the series for decades. I first played III on the DS, so this port felt familiar and comfortable to me. I like having the wide variety of classes and true to the series nature you're looking at a good 40 to 60 hours for a play-thru. There aren't many things I see wrong with it but I'll list what I didn't care for. I save a lot as I play rpgs, so being limited to 3 save slots was tough on me. The game at points isn't always the clearest about where to go next, but I expect that of rpgs. Lastly, be careful of switching jobs in an area you just arrived. I did that once or twice and was stuck struggling to raise my level so that I could survive the new area.Overall I would really recommend it, and it's a great way to start the series since there's no big, complex story behind it. You can pick up/stop and not have too much difficulty in knowing what is going on. One last bit, it's controller friendly, but in my opinion setting the key inputs for awsd layout works great.			"

												If you enjoy JRPGs this is the perfect choice: the mixture between Job System Level and Characters Level is really huge and the Story (as in most of the titles of this Saga) is gorgeous. Nobuo Uematsu, as always, showed majestically his talent as composer.			"

												The old school masterpiece Final Fantasy III. Awesome stories. Its great Turn Based action. Its a great Game but may turn people off who are more into the active time battles featured in today's rpgs's. Class system is innovative and lets you experiment i.e. choose different jobs at any time w/o too much of a penalty. Lands and missions are vast but don't feel overwhelming, and each give enough satisfaction (reward) upon completion.			"

												Loved the game, the story, the graphic, the idea of job system, even though some of the best jobs came too late in the game. Most of all, I like that I didn't have to grind for hours to beat the final boss, it all came naturally from leveling during the main story. People should stop comparing it to the original game, after all it's a remake in terms of visuals, not story. And for those who didn't have the NES version back in the day, it's a good experience especially if you are a fan of the series. I had no issues with the airship or getting stuck, nor experienced any crashes throughout the gameplay.			"

												I made a ""not recommended"" review based on my belief that the game didn't have an option for you to raise your dead chars besides the use of Phoenix Downs...which you can't buy in stores. It turns out that one of two identical-but-rotated springs in the town just heals your party, and the other one raises them. I thought they did the same thing. I'll switch over to ""recommended"" until I actually play through the game now that I know at the very least it's not being unreasonable.			"

												you know how we used to have save points before major bosses, especially if some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decides to make a large dungeon before 2 bosses that use cheap kills, thanks for wasting my time, game was actually fun until that point.okay that was my fault, went back and beat it now the game is good again :P			"
