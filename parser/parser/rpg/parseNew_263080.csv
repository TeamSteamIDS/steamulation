												Good: + lets me find my own way to beat it -> I feel clever (Although I suspect the authors did not intend this but left holes in their game design instead)+ lets me shoot my own bullet hell (But see below!)+ very effective character stats system (Health, damage, range, etc. - all have direct influence. No overhead-layer with ""strength, dexterity, endurance,..."")+ the music+ not too easy and enough health points to not be too frustrating (your mileage my vary)Bad: - NO expanding dungeon! (Did normal mode in ONE DAY) You only get: 4 acts. Each has:  4 maps + 1 boss map.- Procedurally generated? Big words for merely swapping around the same rooms.- very limited monster variety- boring level graphics - although that's the smallest of the problems for me.- broken ammunition / weapon designThe ammunition rules in this game effectively kill most of the fun you could have had with the advertised weapon system:- Die in normal mode: lose all weapons !- Empty your ammo -> lose your current weapon !- Ammunition *as loot* drops only in ineffective dosesIt is not easy to maintan armor repair costs with the loot money. But ammunition cost?! Even if I dedicate all my money to ammunition...- I can only buy ammo in town- I can only go to town before starting the next map- I can only fill up the (250 shot) magazine of the weapon. Effectively I had to use the boring one-shot default weapon most of the time because it has unlimited ammo. And only use the cool weapons sparingly. Switching these weapons on and off was an additional annoyance. (HOTKEY?!) Did I mention you lose ALL weapons when you die? I feel betrayed by the ads promising me to shoot one gorgeous pixel wave after another.The game design also has other very rough edges. Example: Shooting the containers standing around all over the maps takes multiple shots on most containers. So I stood and fired and waited until they broke - this filled at least 25% of all time I played this game. Very annoying. Although I carried neither armor nor upgraded weapon for a long time to save money, I still needed the money from many of the containers. So why not let all of the containers break on first bullet? It would then turn around the experience and be fun instead - to see all the environment break under my bullets fast and easy. (By the way: More damage does NOT make them break faster. In later levels you even get containers that need MORE shots. FACEPALM! I suspect very short sighted game design here: ""These containers look more robust, so I decide they break after 4 shots instead of 3."")All that said - I DO like the game.But I made it my mission to warn you and tell the truth - which the ads DO NOT.

												I only expected to play Pixel Boy for a little while, but here I am three hours later hopelessly addicted and unable to contain my thoughts on it. The dungeon-crawling genre is one we've all come to know and love, but I can't even remember the last time one felt as fresh and unique as Pixel Boy and the Ever Expanding Dungeon. There are plenty of reasons why this stands out among the rest of the bunch on Steam;My first moment with Pixel Boy is a relaxing one, with a slightly blurred image of the quaint little pixel town, Resolutia rolling by the title screen as I'm treated to the relaxing melodies of french electro artist Pyramid. I already feel like I'm in a most blissful state. However, this feeling of relaxation quickly ends, as I start the game and am thrown into the confines of a dark, dusty old dungeon and a glowing trail of blue light as my only guide in this confusion. The game eases you into the mechanics using a humorous narrator that reminded me a lot of Professor Frink from The Simpsons. The lines are delivered infrequently enough to not be a hindrance and are actually pretty damn funny.The almost Minecraft-like graphics are extremely familiar and nostalgic and work exceptionally beautiful in tandem with it's mellow, almost cosmic sounding soundtrack. You're introduced to the armor and pixel power crafting system which are incredibly dynamic and massive in scope when it comes to the number of possibilities and the diversity shown in their execution. Fiddling around with the vast amount of powerups you come across to see which new powerful attacks you can come up with quickly becomes an obsession.After finding the RGB keys and making it out of the first dungeon alive, you're brought back to the pixel-y town from the title-screen which you learn is your base of operations. This base will supply you with a multitude of features including shops for pixel powerups, armor, crafting, a monster museum to keep track of the enemies you've encountered, and doors leading to each of the main campaign dungeons. There is also a mysterious and colorful fountain in the center of the town which seems to be the source of the bliss enducing melody you hear.Once you're done with your introduction to the the town, you will quickly return back to the depths of new dungeons where the pace really begins to pick up, with the music being kicked up a notch going from mellow ambiance to heavy, pulsating rhythms that pump you up for the oncoming journey. The action itself is fantastically solid and fast paced, with an array of stylish monsters and crazy bullet patterns there is a lot going on on the screen at once and it can become a serious sensory-overload in the best way possible. The top-down action combat here is very reminiscent of classics such as Smash T.V. or Pocky and Rocky combined with a weapon combo system similar to Gunstar Heroes and that is a *very* good thing for old school gamers or fans of the golden age of gaming.The roguelike elements become strongly apparent here and are just right, with heavy randomized factors to the dungeon even involving a slot machine minigame to help decide the mobs for your current run (A really cool touch to the randomized aspect of these games!) and persistant stats and gold that will carry over between your deaths, making each consecutive and seemingly impossible run that much easier. The dungeons become extremely challenging and you'll be forced to utilize every item you find and every shop you happen to come across, as well as chestrooms which contain useful powerups for you to use (sometimes negative effects for the unlucky) if you're able to find or buy keys throughout the floor.Pixel Boy really hits that rogue-lite sweet spot and will feel right at home with fans of games like Full Mojo Rampage or Binding of Isaac who want extreme replayability and even deeper, faster paced gameplay. This is an absolute must-have for any dungeon-crawler or rogue-lite collection.			"

												Pixel Boy is probably one of the most addictive Rouge-Like style games I have ever played. The visual effects alone make the game worth while let alone the massively intricate powerup systems which seems to form endless combinations. I have played this game in older beta releases and the full release is just so polished and well put together that it almost feels like a whole new game. Big up to Giant Box games on this release! If you like rogue-likes, rpgs, levelling up or just plain dungeon crawling. This game is for you!			"

												I bought this game because the video looked cool and most of the reviews were positive. I was expecting a game with customization, progression, and creativity. It failed to meet my expectations in any of these categories.Right off the bat it says that it's an ""action RPG"". I thought this meant all these cool powerups were things I could invest in with things like skill points. No. You just find/buy the powerups and they only last 250 shots. Not much of a point using them except for the 'bosses' which will be discussed later.You do level up and get stat points which is cool... but then again it isn't. All you do with your stat points is put them into damage as you do very little. Attack speed? So my powerups can run out even faster? Very lame options here. Just get damage. Zzz...The armor system is yet another under delivered concept. Cool you get customizable armor? That sounds great. Oh it breaks after 5 or so hits? Well I guess that's fine... Oh it isn't really customizable? You just pick 5 of the same boring stats (damage x 5)? Hmmm but they have unique effects! Could be some cool combinations! No. It only has 5 types, depending on what type of 'orb' you use the most of. They all are just an effect on when you get HIT, something you should never do. And the effects hardly do anything other than cause lag. Miss.Bosses I mentioned before. I've been to 2 before I stopped playing. The FIRST boss. Even if you put ALL of your points into damage and save all of the powerups for this fight it will take a very long time. It is pointless to use the 'mechanics' of the lightning trap as it seems to do nothing. All you do is run around in a circle at the bottom of the map shooting it... and shooting it... and shooting it. It has a ridiculous amount of health and isn't interesting at all. I finally figured out that the only way to hurt it is the fire powerup. Dumb.The 2nd boss isn't much better. Once again it has near infinite health. Boring. Once again it is just a reskinned mob. Boring.The mob types are very repetive as are the environment""s"". ""Act 1 and 2"" were the exact same. The same boring environment and mob types, just more hp and probably damage. Horrible. There were only 2 things that weren't terrible about the game and even then they were just fine and ripoffs of other games.The graphics looked fine. A copy of Geometry wars and Minecraft, but not as well done as either.The narrator was okay. Very similar to Bastion to have an involved narrator but nowhere as good.I regret buying this game. It feels like an alpha or an early access game. Not finished at all and the updates they are planning on adding don't address any of the short comings. Not worth $10, maybe $4. Save your money and get Binding of Isaac if you want a game like this, much better. The large amount of positive reviews I suspect were written by the Devs or their friends/family. I could find no reviews of the game online.Sorry if I was harsh Devs, I do not mean to hurt your feelings but this is a bad game and I feel swindled.			"

												WARNING: PASSIONATE AND SLIGHTY MEAN REVIEW UPCOMINGThis game isn't bad. Like the reviewers before me I say that this game could use some work, and it seems that all it's really good for is getting that 5 minute feeling of awesomeness from creating the ultimate pixel spammer. However, this game has more than just that.EffectsHonestly, I HAVE to say that the music is very fitting for the world of Pixel Boy. It makes you feel like you really are in a pixelated world adventuring in dungeons. The narrator is also very funny, throwing great jokes and being quite silly with his netural tone. The world is also quite colorful and many details are put in that you normally wouldn't expect for a $10 game. 9/10StoryThere hardly IS a story in Pixel Boy, as the entire town and dungeon appears as just another punchline. This CAN work out if you do it right, and I really think they did a good job making sure they didn't need one. 8/10GameplayNow here I have an issue. The game itself just feels... empty. As if the developers didn't put it something or got a little lazy. Sure, the dungeon is always randomly generated by randomly arranging rooms, but no matter how you arrange it or whatever value your math textbook says it will add (I know this for myself how tempting it is), you CANNOT cahnge the fact THAT THEY ARE STILL THE SAME ROOMS. The same goes for the enemies. Sure, each level has diffrent mobs, but there are only about 10 or 12 of them. This makes the levels get repetitive after a short time. When Sprial Knights did this, they created HORDES of enemies, easter eggs, and special events. DO IT RIGHT, PEOPLE.  I know the game wanted to focus on the creation of the bullet spammer, the ULTIMATE WEAPON, but the lack of weapon mods limits your creativity more than you'd think. If you're not grinding for your ULTIMATE WEAPON to complete it, you are using it while worrying about AMMO COSTS. Don't listen to those trailers, those people having been playing that game for HOURS AND HOURS on end. It's true that damage is still a little OP. By that I mean it's the MAIN STAT you go for. Armor is completely broken because it's just not worth buying for the lack of creativity it has. All it really does is improve your stats, doing something on HIT (bad ideas are bad) and SAPPING YOUR MONEY THROUGH REPAIR COSTS. Still not worth the coins.  Overall, it feels boring and unnecessary to have such a medicore system.   5/10Overall, if you've played some bullet hell games like Touhou, and you've always wanted to have that kind of ultimate power, get this game. It probably won't be consuming my time like World of Warcraft and Terraira, but it's worth my $10 and definitely has the pontential to become more.			"

Nice dungeon crawler otherwise (on sale though, full price you may feel you didn't get your moneys worth other than the fungi fest)... just stay away from the mushrooms, sure sometimes they give great highs but the lows man... THE LOWS!Addendum: This game is a pretty sweet top down shooter overall... I heartily recommend it and heck, you need to shroom if you want to increase your stats above the level limit so yay for fungi!			"

												Pixel boy is a Dungeon Crawler at it's finest.I love the style, the random generated dungeons and the action you will get.You can change the way you shoot if you find the items for it. Don't like a normal straight shot? How about a shot that split the pixel in 4 smaller pixels?it's very cool to experiment with the shots.If you like Games like The Binding of Isaac or Full Mojo Rampage, you will definitely enjoy this great game too.Btw : Soundtrack is great, too.GG Oricalchos :)			"

I definetely recommend this game, Worth the $10 and it's currently even on sale for $4 so pick this game up!- Art Style is very nice - Music is awesome, i enjoyed the music in this game. In most games with such game play i usually mute the music but not in this, it's pretty upbeat and enjoyable- RPG elements with shoot em up gameplay mechanics? Yes please!- Some funny stuff thrown in there too			"

												Pixel Boy is a dungeon crawler that is very entertaining and that presents a great array of customization. It presents a Minecraft-like environment and it is gorgeous. The powerup combinations are one of the highlights of this game. You can make so many different types of ""pixel-weapons"" and there is enough for every type of player (I personally am not a fan of the ""Spread"" weapon power-up). The only (minor) problem I have with it is the fact that the enemies are also picked at random for each of the levels. I found myself dying to enemies that I clearly could not do anything to protect myself from very early in the game. This was not something that made the game any less enjoyable because the levels themselves (and the power-ups) are all random so it is always a very good experience regardless.			"

												This won't read like a Thumbs up review, but there is no maybe button. First, a disclaimer. I have been looking for a Twin stick shooter rpg for ages. This almost fills the void.Pros:The controls are solid. The character responds well to commands.The music is pretty fantastic.The graphics, while simple, are pretty well done. I love dem square trees.You can feel pretty powerful._______Cons:The bullets (pixels) are incredibly glowy. After a few levels, it's just about all you can see. But it doesn't matter much because;The game is waaaay too easy. Once you implement resource management and get a few upgraded equips, you neve run out of ammo. Which isn't even a complaint really, I hate ammo hunting, but when I can one shot an entire room and kill the final boss before I get a good look at him, things are a tad too easy.The game is waaaaay too short. I put like 3 hours into it and it's done. Which is unfortunate, because I was a lot of fun,The interface. It's not pretty, and doesn't offer a lot of information about what you're looking at. For example, if you're crafting and you want to know how much ammo one of your equips have, you have to leave the crafting table, open up your inventory, and equip the item. There are no tooltips, except to tell you what each item does (also not available while crafting). Some simple quality of life enhancements would make this game a TON better.Small gripe, the monsters don't die as soon as they take a killing blow, and that can be frustrating. It's like, ok, he's dead, but he still got a hit on you after taking all that damage and oh look, now he explodes._____The Breakdown:I like this game. I really do. I'm also glad I got it on sale, because at it's current state, I would have felt a tad dissapointed. I DID have fun with it, and I think a lot of people will, but it just doesnt feel complete.The BrightSide:The developer is being very active. There have already been a few updates that introduce new features, with more on the way. So if you can bare with it through some of it's growing pains, then I would say it's an absolute buy. Now get out there and shoot some pixels!Gaming on Ubuntu 14.04. Pixel Boy runs great on it.			"

												Do you love top down Rogue-like dungeon crawlers like The Binding of Isaac?If yes: Then you NEED this game more than a Heroin addict needs a hot-shot. If no: Then you should still check this out, it may just change your mind. Because this game is WAY better than that above mentioned flash game about a naked baby locked in a basement. In all seriousness, I love this game. The controls are super responsive, which is important because♥♥♥♥♥♥get hectic when you start getting to some of the lower levels. As is the case with most good rouge-likes, the randomly generated nature of the levels means that no two runs are the same. The thing that really sets this game apart though, is the powerup and crafting system. The devs claim there are over 6000 different weapon combinations, and I can believe it. Once you start stacking split and spread shots the game starts looking like a bullet hell shmup that even puts Ikaruga to shame. Top it off with a great soundtrack, and you have a game that pumps blood to my nether regions faster than a topless Daenerys Targaryen.			"

												I was told of this game from a follower on my stream and being a fan of indie rogue types I said ""why not"". Boy was I surprised at the depth this game has. The aesthetic's are just stunning. The gameplay is incredibly smooth and when you start to think ""Boy this is easy with all these upgrades and such"" the game goes and shows you that maybe you shouldn't be so confident after all. The soundtrack is amazing and fits the game perfectly. The dev's also came to my stream and answered questions and genuinely cared about what the people had to say, whether it was advice or criticism. If your still not convinced check out streamers or youtube and I can bet you'll be hooked. 10/10P.S.Also keep in mind these dev's are adding more content in the future for free adding even more replay value for a game that's only $9.99			"

So myself and many others posted on the forums that there needed to be a hardcore(permadeath) mode. What happens a week or two later? Hardcore more. These devs post updates/ patches every few days and they aren't small pointless patches. It is very obvious that they care about there game/baby and the game just keeps getting better and better. Buy this game, it's great now and I promise that you will get patch upon patch that make the game feel brand new each time. Great game, great devs.			"

												Pixel boy and the ever expanding dungeon seems to be a unintentional spiritual succesor to inside a star filled sky. Both with how the powerups are handled and the over all gameplay of shmup (shoot-em-up) vs rougelike. Currently however this game is quite short, in less than an hour I've managed to play through and expereince as much as I feel I can from it in it's current state (future updates are promised with more content). I do suggest purchasing this game for it's great gameplay style, groovy chill soundtrack and attempt to refresh an old genre but only if you absolutely love rougelike games.			"

												i love this game so much and it could be for anybody! the soundtrack is amazing although i wish it had more but it did come out only yesterday(may20th) i have little problems with the actual game. the different combinations and decisions you have to make it awesome! In some of the dungeons you end up with the easy enemies while in others you have the toughest. But like the narrartor says, you can't just focus on one skill. if you focus on range you can kill from a far but it would take a while since you dont have good damage or rate of fire, then you have too much damage and you have to get close for a shot or two, basically, you have you have it balanced. it does get crazier and crazier but that makes it fun! although i will admit i raged alot about the enemies ending up surrounding you while you can only focus on one for they all shoot at you longer. after you get the lifesteal, it gets easier. This is, like everyone else has said, an addicting game, i can't stop until i die! it is very fun and colorful too! it is cheap right now and i probably will spend more time on this than in other current game by the way the narrator is hilarious!

												After 2 hours. I was hooked. This game has a great soundtrack to match the challenging and unpredictable gameplay. No two rooms are the same ever. Voiceover is comical and placed quite well. The enemies are challenging, and pose different threats depending on the random selection of what will show up. The powerups are useful and can be combined for different results, none of which are hindering. You can also form temporary armor that has different powers and stat bonuses depending on how you arrange them, so you have many options and lots of replay value. The RPG elements are also a great feature, each play through can be entirely different depending on how you build your character. Right now I'm tank and speed and it's working relatively well, but I do have to hit more to get kills.This gets a 10/10. I will keep going back to this game for a long time. Remember, you have a sheild, it helps. -_-			"

												Well this game has to be one of the funnest games i have played in a long time. From 10,000 different weapon combos and a tiered armor system that changes based off that weapon combo is just incredicle. Not to mention the punishing and shamefulness of defend when you charge off into a room and bite off more than you can chew feeling (one would say keyboard bashing like punishment!). Pixel Boy is a great Rogue Like RPG elements top down dungeon crawler with a random gen dungeon system that creates endless possibilites and incredible replay value! The Music that is done by Pyramid is outstanding and i find myself tapping my foot to the beat with sitting on the edge of my seat tippy toeing around each corner to ensure my safety! The Art style is truly one of a kind and so very clean!

												Pixel Boy and the Ever Expanding Dungeon is very good.At first I was wondering whether or not to buy this game, but I'm happy I got it. Although it needs a few tweaks here and there, its an overall solid game. The graphic style of this game really suits the name and gameplay. This game is very colourful and action packed. The Mob Maker 9000 and the random(ish) map generation keeps the gameplay fresh. The customisation of weapons and armour is immense, you can technically create it with any combo. And let me remind you that this game came out recently.You play as Pixel Boy. You run around weird dungeon things killing weird creature things and picking up weird boxes with weird effects. Weird, but in an excellent way.Pros and Cons:Pros:- Nice graphics- Replayability- Devs respond to the questions- Customisation- The soundtrackCons:- Dying screen is a little boring- Multiple glitches, nothing gamebreaking though.I give this game an overall rating of  8.5/10.

And Nickervision (Nick I guess his name is) is very active on steam, testing and developing the game, getting suggestions and even asking me what should be added!

The first time I played I only expected to test the game out quickly and ended up being hooked for hours. The game continues to get better the further you get into it and I love how within day the developers had already put out a patch incorporating everybody's ideas. I can't wait to see what new ideas are in the pipeline and I definitely recommend this game for casual or experienced gamers alike			"

												Lets see....it's.... Beautiful. Beautiful sound track, beautiful colors, so very simple yet beautifully challenging. It's beautiful in the way it smacks you around becuase you are to much of a spaz and haven't realized there are tactics to fighting each mob...you can only run backwards for so long before that fails you. You will learn <space bar> is your best friend. The most Beautiful thing about this game is that it's only $10.......what a steal. I would pay at least twice that much.			"

												A suprisingly good game, it is a rogue-lite game that uses randomly generated dungeons of increasing difficulty and size as its level/act system. You have Pixel powers that improve your base attack in various ways.When you die you drop all your pixel powers and powerups, you get to keep your levels and money. Add to the fact you have limited ammo makes for a fun yet challanging experience.MUST PLAY.			"

												Neat little game thats got some cool retro vibes.Basically you combine shot powerups into all sorts of crazy combinations and blast through hordes of baddies as you sniff around random dungeons for loot. You can craft armor too for added customization. Simple yet addictive.The game needs a tad more polish but the price is right and the devs appear to be VERY active in listening to the players so I have no doubt the game will be polished nicely with time. If you enjoy roguelikes, aRPGS and even Bullet Hells this could be the game for you!			"

												The premise of this game is great: a twin stick shooter with combinable / craftable powerups and armor, and RPG lite character leveling. Originally, there were some balance related issues that I felt detracted from the fun too much for me to recommend the game (limited ammo on powerups combined with bugs that required more ammo to break crates and the amount of gold you could earn per level compared to what it would cost to get back all those cool powerups when they ran out) but recent changes have addressed those concerns, and the addition of controller support improved the experience even more!There are still some minor bugs to be squashed, but overall the game is fun, and the developers are very actively engaged in listening to user feedback and fixing issues they report!

												I like this game for many reasons and I will state them now. One: I love the graphical feel of it and even though it has a lot of vibrant lights and colors there isn't much in the way of power needed to run the game. Two: The weapon system is a very cool and new thing to me. I have seen some things similar but I have not seen something quite like this. Three: I like that it has the feel of a hack and slash game yet it has no real hack nor does it have slash. I like this game but the game play can become stale and that is a very common thing with this kind of indie came. I would like to see this game become a starting point for new developers but I can't say this game is revolutionary. I can play it for some time, but I end up becoming bored after playing for more than 45 minutes. I would give this game a 3 OUT OF 5 stars because it just can't give me the feel that I can get fro, some of my personal favorite games in this genre like Diablo III or Some other AAA games that can pull me in and always make me want to improve my skill with random armor and other things like that. So my main verdict about this game is that it needs more to pull me and any other players into the game for any sort of time. FIN			"

The pixel construction mechanic is sweet with some pretty ridiculously cool combinations.  Great soundtrack that gets (pleasantly) stuck in my head and drags me back in to dungeon crawl again.Hands down the best part though is the narration at the beginning of every level, really adds a touch of zazz that any nerd can love.

												One thing to say: the difficulty level is not balanced at all. Certain portions of the game are really fun to play while others just make you want to stop playing entirely. The fact that you lose your inventory on death contributes to this enormously. Other than that, the game is entertaining. I find that the weapon customization changes things up a bit.			"

Posted: June 7, 2014
												I have played this game for awhile, and im here to give an honest review. This game is very fun, and addictive, but has some issues, more on that later. Firstly, the game is fun, the ""pixel powers"" are a unique and fresh feature for a rouge-like game. You get powers like bigger bullets, more spread from your shots, and you can even get flaming bullets, and tons more. You can combine the powers to make them even more deadly!! The enemies you encounter are kinda random, you face against ants, frogs, skulls, snakes, slimes, etc. But each have unique attacks. I have gotten to Act 3 now, and the levels never look the same, which is a cool feature. As you would expect in a rouge-like game, once you die you basically lose everything, except the levels, coins, and attributes you gave your character, but i feel like once you die, you should just restart the game, since you lose all the powers you got, and probably dont have enough coins to resupply yourself, but thats to be expected in a game like this. And finally, the bad things/glitches that might happen. The first bad thing, for me, is that the game is short, only 4 acts, and has little replayability, for me of course, but the devs said they are gonna add daily dungeons, so look up on that. The next thing is that the game kinda feels repetitive, other than the Mob Maker 9000 which randomly generates the enemies, you just look for the same three keys, or the RGB, and then you beat the level, and of course, at the end of each act there is a boss, each one i faced was fun and fast paced, really good fights. Those are the bad things, for me, now onto the glitches that you may get, and the ones i experienced. Some enemies or coins will fly off the level, and end up in the blackness, which makes it impossible to get or kill, and the other one is that the enemies will get stuck in the doors, and just wait for you to kill them. Other than that, no more glitches, that i experienced. Overall, this game was very good, i still havent beaten it, but i will. I recommened this game to anyone who like rouge-like games. 8.5/10			"

Posted: December 20, 2014
												Short version: This game feels slow, boring, and unfinished.  And the game mechanics seem to be working against itself.  That being said, it's probably an okay kids game.Long version: At first glance, this game seems pretty decent.  Twin stick styled overhead shooter with eye pleasing low poly graphics, responsive controls, and decent music.  But after playing nearly two hours of it, I can say so far it's been very same-y and disappointing.  It's not a roguelike, as I've seen it be referred to as, since there's little penalty for death.  It's just a twin stick dungeon crawler type thing.First off, the combat.  WASD moves the character, mouse shoots.  You can get limited ammo power ups, wear armor, blah.  The enemies are for the most part nonthreatening, so the power ups aren't really vital.  Plus the level design is really claustrophobic.  So enemies will usually be funneling through narrow halls and doorways, oftentimes getting stuck on each other.  The only real danger of being hit is at the start of the floor, when the doors open, and enemies from the adjacent rooms all bum rush you, getting shot from offscreen, or when an enemy decides to hide behind a door frame and ram into you.  And because the game is pretty slow at the beginning, you have plenty of time to react to any encroaching danger, at least if you can see it.  Another serious issue comes from the fact that the enemy ai doesn't seem to know how to navigate the modular rooms, and frequently gets stuck in door frames.  Or if they are a roaming type, end up collecting in a far off corner of the map, no where near the player.  The usually frenetic and fun combat that usually comes from twin stick shooters just isn't here.The level design itself, as I mentioned before, seems to be working against the game mechanics.  It's a twin stick shooter shoehorned into tight boxes and hallways.  With the exception of the boss fights, which do open up a bit, the level design is nearly identical boxes and hallways.  There's really no reason to dodge anything when the better alternative is to just run back into the previous room and shoot enemies as they get stuck in the door frame.  There are a few bigger rooms that may spawn, but they usually have a gimmick about them take takes up most of the real estate, but the gimmick is usually 'hold the space bar for a bit'.  And even though the floors are randomly generated, it's hard to tell, because thus far they've all looked nearly identical in layout.  You start on the bottom left corner of the map, next to a set of bonus rooms you can unlock somewhere on that floor.  The exit to the next floor is generally only a few room to the top right, and a tresure chest room reasonably close to that.  And a few square rooms scattered around all of this, hiding exit keys and monsters.  The boss rooms open up a bit, but the bosses themselves are pretty simplistic and easy.There's a selection of power ups, but a lot of them seem superfluous.  There's spread and split shots, which seem pointless since there's very few areas that aren't tiny boxes with bottle necks.  You have homing shots, shots that make your bullets bigger, passive bullet shields, single use bomb like items.  You can equip armor that gives you extra hits and passive abilities.  But really, you'd probably just be better off pumping all of your stat points into damage and speed and just using whatever else you might have.  You can also get stat boosting or reducing mushrooms, but they don't really factor in much, since they seem fairly rare, and barely bump your stats in either direction.  So neither risk nor reward.The bright spots are the graphics and music.  The graphics are colorful and pleasing, while still having a low poly look.  The overhead prospective is fine, with the exception that enemies can hide behind door frames and get cheap hits on you as a result.  Game runs fine, with the exception of the second boss, which for some bizarre reason tanked my framerate down to almost single digits.  And the music is chiptune-y and reasonably catchy.  Having closed the game out 15 minutes ago, I can't even remember any of the musical tracks already, but it did serve it's purpose of being something inoffensive playing in the background.Overall, this feels like an early access game that just happened to be put on the full release list.  There's not much content (apparently I'm already half way through the game, and the only reason I have almost two hours in it is because of the slow pace), and the combat doesn't change past the tutorial.  I can really only recommend it at a deep discount, as a bundle extra, or as something for a younger kid to play.  But I can't personally recommend it, considering there's better alternatives on Steam that are cheaper too.			"

												If you like power ups and combining them then this game has quite a bit to offer you. Deaths can be both more and less forgiving in this rogue-lite genre game. Difficulty ranges from casual and ramps up as you progress to become chaotic with more enemies, bullets, and obsticals to dodge. The glitches in the game are fortunately being addressed quickly as the developers seem to respond well to fixing them. They really seem to want to make their game great and not just push something out for a quick buck or ten. That said, there is still some more fixing to go but I'm confident that, like the rest of it, it'll all come together. So grease up your keyboard, stretch out your fingers, and shuffle around your mouse for a progressively faster paced game with Pixel Boy and the Ever Expanding Dungeon.			"

												This game is an awesome way to kill a few minutes(while waiting for the wife to get ready to go to the grocery store) or a few hours(while waiting for the wife to get ready for a resteraunt) the way the powers stack allows all sorts of cool combinations. I highly recommend this game for the mere $10 if you can get it on sale then its a must buy!			"

												It's a cool game, somewhat similiar to binding of isaac, with interesting way of crafting weapons and armors. It also has randomly generated dungeons, so hop right into it.			"

												(SOMEWHAT LONG READ BUT VERY VERY INFORMATIVE TO BUYER)It is not a bad game BUT some ""features"" are quite frustrating and unintuitive uncreative,  also , the trailers are misleading, it seems you only get powerups like those after grinding - late game - spending money which brings me tofirst off... THE NARRATOR, if there were any that make me wanna slit my veins.... he is very annoying.. and seems purposely made annoying with no real factor as to why.... other than to be a ""joke"" , a very very bad joke in bad taste... detracting from the games atmosphere.Armor- you can craft armor that gives you bonus stats, helpful , but , they cost quite a bit to make even decent ones with scarce resources that you find , and the armor is too expensive to repair , and some enemys , hit you a lot of the time. Crafting - is garbage... in my inventory i am told what powerups do such as split - grow ect. but when i want to craft at the bench 2 powerups together , the crafting screen doesnt tell me which powerups i am combining... only their picture/letter. making crafting a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥. having to close and repopen the menus to know what you are doingPoweups- they have limited ammo and when combined have even less ammo???  and you can only have 3 equiped... (i explain later) why...WHY? is it because you enemies are bland? and would otherwise be easily defeated if i had unlimted ammo?there are loot chests with more powerups and YOU HAVE TO BUY KEYS FOR THEM and the mostly drop mushrooms instead of powerups and those mushrooms seem 80% degenerative instead of aiding ... and money is already hard to manage.  BC it cost money to combine powerups so you can keep the ones you found to keep in the three slots...oh and if you die with your good powerups all combined together and equiped, you lose them, having to restart the quest of finding them in the first placeit costs money to repair armor , buy keys hoping to get powerups , buying HP potions because of cramped rooms , creeps hiding behind walls.  and buying mushrooms in  hopes of stat bonuses BC of slow leveling up... and Money to Combine powerups and buying ammo for those powerups so you dont lose them....Enemies - bland.... boring , and annoying enviroments - are also very bland and Cookie Cutter... only boss rooms are any different and have some some.. pizzazzTHe town is annoying to navigate through.. having to load a shop that should be outside or be enterable already... Preloaded NPC are useless, personal home is uselessOverall a lot of what should make this game fun  DETRACT from the game i guess thats what you get for 5 or less dollars though........Fix it and i will change to positive			"

												I don't get the bad reviews. For it's price, it's a great little game.Well, it's a weird one also. I don't know the guys who made this, but i think they're former atari programmers from the 80's who got stuck in a time bubble somewhere and decided the make a game after playing Isaac. Also, maybe they were drunk and/or high on shrooms. But it's fun. and colorful. very colorful. and the soundtrack is really good, ambient at times, electro at others, it can feel out of tune with the game at first, but it starts growing on you after a while. all in all, i don't regret buying it. Go ahead and give it a chance ;)			"

												What I was expecting :- Hotline Miami / Binding of Isaac / <insert any small rpg here> roguelike game with Castle Crashers humor matchup.What I got :Hotline Miami : Top-Down Miami style is here but the game is slow ... so slow ... I almost felt asleep while streaming this game to make people discover it until everybody accorded it would be better to change game.Binding of Isaac : 6000 different powerful weapons ? The truth is : 20 powers ups you can combine by 3 with 3 slots total (20^3 = 8000). So if you are expecting Binding of Isaac like random items that can give 6000 differents weapon style and different every game or whatever, you are not in the good direction.<insert any small RPG name here> : I got what i was expecting. SMALL rpg. 5 stats, you can boost each level + Armor crafting (5 slots for 5 components which are the 5 stats) + need to repair the armor. That's about it.Rogue Like : Could have been, but the slow long start kills the fun. Maybe the daily dungeon thingy that will come later will change my mind about it not being replayable but.. eh. Mob Generator is funny once, then you skip it anytime and revealing the RNG kills it.Castle Crasher humor : Even if it's not the same style, i have to admit this is the good part of the game, the voice is amazing and the jokes are cool.In my opinion, i should play it a little bit more, maybe it gets better but i don't feel like it and i feel cheated by the description.Otherwise nice work for the devs, I think a lot of work needs to be done for this game to be really good and worth that much money.

												bright and colorful dungeon crawler that provides challenge and strategy along with a splash of wit and charm. It mixes elements from shoot-em-ups along with some interesting customization that provides a unique experience every time you play. Each level is randomly generated, both in layout and in the variety of monsters that will spawn. Combat is simple enough in that you move with the WASD keys and point your gun with the mouse.			"

												This is a very simple roguelite.  It plays to be more action oriented but the enemy variety doesn't play to that strength.  There just aren't enough of them in the game and a few overlap what they do.  Even the room variety is very low.  You'll see most if not all the rooms in the very first floor with 16 total.  The game is even designed to get you permenantly stuck if you die too much since you'll be stuck in a later floor with only your basic attack.  Fortunately for that point (unfortunately for the game), this game is very easy.Early on you have to be careful.  Avoiding enemies and their attacks and conserving your ammo.  Not helped by the fact the doors to each room can easily obscure enemies and their bullets.  However, by the time I hit the second zone, I was already a death machine and things only snowballed for me from there.  Bonus health, lifesteal, and  bullets in all directions made me nearly invincible.  The only way I was dying at that point was if I decided to stop shooting and hug everything instead.  Bosses included.  There is a reason why the rarest achievement in the game is getting 100 deaths.  Personally, I won with only one death.  That may be the most damning sentence for a roguelite.			"

												I once wrote a rather mean review of this game because it didn't have decent joystick support. Now it has perfect joystick support, but the game is just... kinda shallow and boring. The enemies aren't terribly varied, and the rooms generated for gameplay don't create any sort of challenge or depth. I wouldn't even mind how slow it is if I felt like I had somewhere to go.It's just kind of amateur. There's a hub world, but it's purely functional and eats up time; could have been just a menu. There's a ""crafting"" system, but your resources don't vary (since they come from a set number of enemies). There's no real quests or goals which is weird since they put so much time into the world. It's the classic issue where all the surface content-- the theming, the design, the ""hilarious"" narrator --was developed without a compelling game to put it on.I'd advise the crew to check out ""Radiant Inferno"" for an idea of how a game like this could work better. It has the *opposite* problem. A fun, involving shooter that's just boring to look at.			"

												I'm not going to get into the wordy, half a page long review of the game and every single little detail f whats wrong/right with the game. Over all this game is very good, and has aspects of many other games that i really enjoy, mainly The Binding of Isaac. The soundtrack is great and i actually like listening to it, where as most games i automatically mute the music.If you are on the fence about this game, it is a lot of fun although it is not a game that you will probably want to continually play for hours and hours. Its a nice medium length game, that has the ability to bep played more even when finished. I would truely like to see more added into the game and some silly little broken parts of the game fixed. In the end this game is definately worth the price, and for a small developer it is very well done.			"

												There's a reason they don't have the annoying♥♥♥♥♥ wannabe Cartman-sounding / South Park - esque narrator in the game trailer. Thankfully they include an option to turn down the volume on this putz. The gameplay itself, however, is much slower-paced than the trailer would have you believe. Maybe it intensifies as you progress, but first impression is the narrator's wanna be humor wears thin very quickly and the gameplay is much more bland than the trailer suggests.			"

												Aesthetically pleasing Rouge-like/Dungeon Crawler.The rouge-like gameplay is classically fun and exciting, compimented by the pairing of amazing music (by Pyramid, Please offer the soundtrack as DLC!) and the dazzlingly bright effects make this an all-around win in my opinion. The randomly generated dungeons are ""randomly generated"" well enough to keep it from being boring, but is a weak arguement for replay value.The only real problem I have with this game is that it isn't multiplayer. I can't really understand why either, a 2 player co-op option would be so much fun, and would give this title real replay value. I'd be interested in a sequel with bigger dungeons, epic bosses, and co-op/party modes.			"

												My first impression of this after two dungeons is that I won't be going back. Here's why:- Dreadful voice acting. Thankfully it let me turn off the narrator right in the middle of the tutorial.- Very generic and uninteresting dungeon design, both in the visuals and the layout. Each one has only four monster types, evenly spread around the whole level. So no wondering what awaits you in the next room like Binding of Isaac.- You get stuck easily on small obstacles, infuriating when trying to circle-strafe a monster- You can't see monsters when they are behind walls or below the doorframe. Coupled with the fact that they can aggro you from nearby rooms, it means they can close the distance hidden and appear right behind you.- Shots feel weak (sound effects problem I think), and there's no indication of your range. Aiming with an unconstrained mouse cursor while you can't always reach where you're pointing just feels weird.Some things look pretty and the music didn't sound bad, and the powerup combining looks interesting, but it's not enough to redeem it for me.

												I got this game for a dollar first of all, but it still wasnt really worth it. Yes, i only have 23 minutes in this game but i got bored pretty quick! It was very slow and the only way to upgrade speed/firing speed/range etc. was to get lvl ups, which took forever. i went into the town but couldnt do anything due to it saying i couldnt leave because of narroration in progress, but there wasnt anyone talking. Also, I didnt really like how the power ups worked. Whenever you recieved one it had a number of bullets you could fire until you ran out, I thought it ruined the ""go in blazing"" strategy i usually do in these type of games. I wouldn't reccomend this for regular price, but if it is on sale and you dont mind slow games, it could have potential.			"

Posted: June 5, 2014
												I feel that the pacing is way off on this game. There is too much emphasis put on doing repeat runs of the same levels. When I finally made it to the first boss, and wasn't successful on my first try (I died), I ended up having to do two more runs of the level before the boss before I was able to save up enough money to get the power-ups and armor that I would need to even beat the boss. I understand that you get to keep money when you die, but when I drop 75 coins on getting some nice abilities that I want to save for the boss battle, and then I end up dying on the level before the boss battle, I end up wasting all those coins. This means I have to do at least one full run through before I have enough money to repurchase everything. I also always seemed to be one damage point behind the amount of armor I could afford to repair. If it cost 80 to repair, I only had 67 coins, but then when I had 80 coins saved up, it then cost 100 to repair the armor. It would be nice if you could improve lesser increments of the armor for smaller amounts of gold. I'd rather put 20-40 gold into repairing the armor temporarily than lose the whole armor and have to use 100-250+ gold to craft a new set.While this game may be similar to The Binding of Isaac, it is not on the same par. There's no sense of dread, no sense of being alone in a world set against you. The atmosphere of this game is lost when the pleasant town is just an elevator ride away. One of the most annoying things though, is having a really nice group of abilities, and you're doing well in a level, and then they all run out of shots, and you're left with the default shot, which is pretty terrible. You can only hope you have found enough gold in the level already (or have some left over from before the level, haha) to purchase a key and hope it's a good ability.I hope that there are some great updates in the future of this game that help bring it up to a level where I would favorably compare it with The Binding of Isaac. The people involved with this game are really nice, and I hope to see them improve the balance and pacing of the game.			"

												This is worse than that explosive diarrhea I had last week, avoid it like the plague or you might get cholera.Seriously though, i finished the whole game in two hours, it was boring as♥♥♥♥♥ Its not a rogue-like as there is no replay ability after the first time you have experienced. The voice acting and writing is awful, if you want to replay mute the voice.Edit:The reasons this game is bad:Enemies are boring and nothing special, the randomiser doesn't achieve anything. I completed the game and didn't see all of the enemies.Bullets are to easy to get, again throughout my one play through, the only time i had to get new power ups was when I died. As soon as i got a level 5 power up i could fire into a room, leave the room and everything would die.Armour, every single armour ""bonus effect"" is the same, they all do some type of area damage. Come on is it that hard to have 5 different effects.Power ups: 6000 combos is bull, you can combine 9 power-ups after that it is maxed out and you just make another 9 until you have 3 which achieves nothing as they didn't seem to stack in effect.Not to mention all the effects are boring and unoriginal: homing, big bullets. Come on something interesting, what about firework shots that explode into a colourful AOE, Or like snake shots that fire in the pattern a snake moves. YOU COULD THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS.......The levels are all the same, just minorly different environments, things like water or snowmen in the level, but it is still the same boring squares looking for keys to go down a level.There should be more than 4 levels, 2 hours for a playthough with no carry on is nothing in a rogue like....The art style is cheap and simple, it's just voxels, every single other indie title uses voxels as an easy way out... Voxels have been done before and they are nothing special.The music gets repetitive super fast, after 10 minutes I just muted it with the narrator Im sorry to rain on anyones parade that likes this game, but you are objectively wrong, this game is bad.Also, if you die on a run, just start the game again, without loads of money you can't survive. TL:DR This is not worth ten pounds, enemy design is boring, level design is unoriginal and the game reeks of feces. Go get a fun rogue-like such as rogue legacy which will last you much longer and you'll enjoy.			"

												HALT, don't buy this game, for starters, not even one person  who reviewed this game spelled 'rogue' right. That is, the multitude of the upvoted ones.THIS IS THE GREATEST ROUGE LIKE I AVER EVER PLAYED IT EVEN FEELS LIKE MINECRAFT, oh good lord..Generation is bland, the price is high. It should be like five dollars, considering people think it's better than the binding of issac.The store thinks that 6000 different combinations makes you want to find all the different items in this game. Which are a total of 30, bosses are easy, the game is easy. The artstyle is literally like minecraft, another game I hate.Narrator takes away replayabilty by hearing the same stuff over and over again.The game calls itself a roguelike by just randomizing enemies.This is going to be ported to the WIi U this summer sometime, no offense to the wii u. But all roguelikes on the WII U are literally terrible, including this game. This game ruined my hype for what it had to offer. Even on sale it was too pricey. I got this game for 7.49 USD. What a bad choice.Apparently the developers are making some sort of daily dungeon thing where they create a dungeon and it's better quality than the ones generated.But what will happen once the developers stop doing that? It's not even out right now, and the game is still pretty bad and not fun.In fact, this game was a chore to play because I wanted to get my money's worth in hours. Probably the highest amount of hours you can get in this game after seeing what it has to offer is 4 hours, FOUR HOURS.Now that's understandable, games can have a short story, and that's okay.But a roguelike? Roguelikes are made to endure endless replayability, not having slots to level up with no permadeath.Hardcore mode is easier than the original mode that this game offers, with more drops.A good example of an RPG without permadeath that still manages to be a roguelike is Hero Siege. Man, what was I thinking.			"

												This game while okay is just... well, okay. It never gets actually fun or tense as it is so easy to become completely imba after jsut the 2nd act that the entire game jsut becomes a grind to the end.Quite honestly I TRY to like it but its jsut not fun because its so easy :/ It also feels like its an early access game because it just kinda of feels... empty. Theres not much too it and its a very short game :(I feel heavy buyers remorse after paying £5 for it, Because in its current state it is simply just not worth that much money. Not that im saying its not worth paying for, it IS worht being a retail game, but I would say in and around the area of £2.99 would be MUCH more reasonable and match the cost of the game to its actual fun to time played raitio (i made that last part up)All I can hope is that one day the devs flesh it out some and  re-balance the upgrade system. But atm the game is jsut a grind to the end and SPOILER ALERT I beat the end game boss in 4 measily clicks.... quite literally the first boss in the game was harder.Also a side note the game is a bit slow and alot of the enemies feel the same. Even if you dump all your points into speed and get the top teir speed armour your character still moves very slowly			"

												you might know that i had a review of this game before, saying that it was worth $5 and that its goodi have deleted that reviewthe only thing that i now agree with from my former review is that the narrator is extremely annoyingat first, it seems more like a binding of isaac kind of game, with random set of rooms and enemies each floor and perma-deathonce you get one or two levels deep, however, you realise that this is not that kind of gamein games like binding of isaac, each level has its own very large variety of enemies and roomsin this game, there is very little room variety, except for a few random boxes placed here and there throughout each roomthe enemy variation system is very poorly designed, as there is a single (small) set of enemies for all the floors, four of which are assigned to you each floor (except the first floor)the problem with this is that some enemies are much harder than others, and the likelyhood of you completing the floor is largely based on luck and not skill, as enemies tend to swarma lotALL the doors to ALL the rooms are permanently opened when you open the first doorthe idea of ""rooms"" for this game is hardly used at alland the dungeon isnt ""ever expanding"" like the title saysyou will shortly come to a point to where youve explored all of a floor with little to no reward for doing sothe ""power-up"" system is all over the place as welleach power-up has a certain amount of ammo, which will run out much faster than you thinkhowever, when you run out of ammo, the power-up doesnt stay in your inventoryit just disappears forevereven though the description says ""Players can stack and combine power ups into over 6000 different powerful weapons,"" this is hardly the caseeither this is a blatant lie, or most of the power-ups are extremely raresome of them are pointless as well, like Returning Pixelsyoud think that it would return some pixels (your ammo) to you after you fired them, but noit does absolutely nothingthis is just a bad gamei would maybe think it was worth it if it was free, but id honestly rather have a bunch of pictures of finger nail clipping saved on to my computer insteadi actually made my first game category today because of this gamei called it ""Bad Games""and now that i think about it, the graphics arent really that greatas i said, id rather have the afore mentioned pictures of finger nail clippings saved on my computer than this game, or even pictures of this gamehonestly a 2/10			"

												Game is super boring and repetitive. You go into a dungeon and go through 4 levels before a boss level. You do this four times, and every time is the EXACT same. Each level has the exact same layout of similar looking square rooms with barrels and boxes in them. No level felt different in the slightest. Each level has a shop/exit room, a secret locked chest room, and 3 hidden colored keys (thought we moved on from that after ""Doom"" and ""Duke Nukem""?). There are about 6-7 total different enemies and each level there is a fake computer slot machine to decide which 3 of the 7, but after you've played a few levels you will have seen them all enough to be super sick of them. For some reason the whole system and mechanics are flawed. Lets start with money. You made money INCREDIBLY slowly. Each level you might make 200 or so, and thats the cost of 1 special weapon shot, or the cost of combining a few types of shots. Each barrel only gives you 1-2 gold, so they are worthless, and even the secret chest that seems like a lot gives you like 100. Oh but lets not forget how there are 5 tiers of armor, and the 2nd one costs 500. Yes it costs about 2-3 levels to afford it. Oh and guess what, it gives you stats and another health bar basically, but its just like health, which goes down super quickly, and once its gone, its completely gone, and you're out 500 bucks and 2-3 levels of gold farming, and it usually is gone by the first or second level you use it. You can repair it while its low, but oh wait, thats 150-200, about equal to what you get per level, meaning you can't repair it until you beat the level, but if you lose it during the level its too late. Horrible system and made me not want to use it. Why cant you sell things you pick up to make extra money you ask, as you will get multiple extra shots and will have like tons of materials each level when you only need 5, and can't use more for some reason, to make armor. But oh wait, those semi-rare shots you picked up, they sell anywhere from 1-2 gold to 10 gold, meaning they don't do sh!t for your gold. Oh and those materials that have tons of that you don't need, those sell for 2 gold or so, meaning you can make a whopping 50 gold from selling everything, which won't pay for anything. If it sounds dumb to you that's because it is. And if you die on a level you lose your entire equipped shots, meaning something you spent 300-500 gold to make is gone. The best part is, now that you have no money, and you've used all your good shots, and it costs money just to put shots together, you are super weak and do no damage at the next level, which just makes things worse for no reason. The funny part is, combining shots doesn't even make it stronger, it just adds effects. I had 6 things combined and it still took about 6-7 shots to kill 1 single guy, and there are like 4 per room, and 50 per level. Oh but you can level up, at about once every 2-3 levels. And you super boringly can put 4 total points in 5 categories such as damage, speed, fire rate, etc. There are no cool abilities or any excitement in leveling up. And seeing as you gain 1 point in a few stats, it makes almost no different from level to level. Then there's this moronic ammo. So lets say you spent 3 levels worth of dough, actually got good types of shots, spent good money combining them, and haven't died so you don't drop them all, that's all it takes right? Wrong. You actually have set ammo, which drains 2 ammo per shoot, and about 50 guys per level, and 10 shots per guy or so, you got it right, that means even for playing well you run out of all that money you spent on shots in ONE LEVEL or so. Yes there are a few ammo pickups but they add 10 ammo and you spent about 100 before you find each one. The system makes no sense and basically means you run out of the money that takes you foreever to make, no matter what you do. There are only a few shots, and you use the same ones every level. Super boring. Oh and don't let me forget the genious idea of mushrooms, which you spend money or keys on chest to get, and they either give OR take your stats away. And as everyone on the forums can agree on, its about 4-1 ratio in favor of those taking away your stats, so just a dumb idea, a waste of money, and almost no value to them as a mechanic as they are illogical. There just isn't really any fun reason to play the game. Super repetitive and boring, no spells, boring leveling, never make money, don't do any damage, everything is too expensive. So save yourself the trouble. 4.5/10.			"

												Grade: C+It's okay, just gets very boring and repetitive very quickly. The spell powers are not even that interesting. The power ups system would fit into an old school 2D shooter/bullet hell game. But the dungeon levels just makes it tedious, and you never get to use your full power except on the 4 bosses.

												First of all, i bought this on a whim and i don't fully regret it, but i wouldn't recommend it either, unless it's at least 50% off. Here is why:Pros: -Eyecandy if you are into flashy pixels-Some sort of progression, allthough barely relevant-Chill music-Relatively funny naratorCons:-Short with no incentive to replay it.-As soon as you gather some money to combine powerups and figure out what you're doing, you are insanely OP and game provides zero challenge (In a regular playthrough without any farming, i shot Act 2 boss three times and it was dead before it even moved.-BIGGEST CHALLENGE INGAME: Find the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ color key. Since you need 3 RGB keys to progress through the level, and every square of the map has stationary lights that shine brighter than the keys themselves (also for example a red key can be placed under a red light, rustling your jimmies incognito), you are gonna move around as a snail after you killed every mob to find the damn missing keys, unless you were lucky enough to stumble on all three. This could be simply improved if keys would show on map, but right now they don't so it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Typical stage scenario: Spend 3 minutes walking around as a bullet hell boss, spend 5 more minutes walking around gathering a key.-The latest update gave ammo drops. They said they may remove that, but at the moment it just removes the one thing that stopped me from going back to town or stop using the op bullets. Not to mention the bullets 'wallhack' and with pumped range you can clear 4 rooms without facing any enemies at all. Also the 'combine powerups, mix and match' is a big blabber as well. You are gonna throw in all of them times three anyway and say hello godmode.Bottom line, game needs balance and vigor. If you are a stoner trying to chill going pew pew with pixels, go ahead. If you are looking for a nice crawler expecting another isaac or something, it ain't happening, but they are updating it frequently so this stands for the time being.			"

												This is probably a very personal review in a way but i fell that the picthures and what the description promied is not the game i brough nowhere close. I saw like the slot thingy and the rouge like tag and i though: ""Awesome another rougelike with gameling aspects and big changes everytime!"" And guess what it was only to chose what enemies to spawn in the room.The 0.3 hours i spend in this game i felt it was way to easy and slow going and the crafting system was obnoxious and repetative (And honestly dont have a crafting system in a rougelike i think that is absolutly horrible, atleast if you do make it so you have a chance to lose your items.)I might be judging this game harshly for only having played it for 0.3 hours but i just want to say i honestly fell scammed after buying this game, not in form of like it being malware or anything just taht i interpretited the description/pics wrong and i do not fell i got nowhere close to what was promised. If you are a fan of rougelikes like Isaac, Rouge Legacy or Death skid marks witch are my favorite all time games, i just want to warn you all this game is no where close. As of how far i got into the game i would say 2/10 as i honestly have nothing possitive to say about this game as one of the otehrs do it way better.			"

												Looking for a challenge? Want to play a supposedly hardcore?Then this game is not for you. I've heard lots and lots of commentaries/reviews about how hard and unforgiving this game is, even to the point where they had to restart the whole game because they just couldn't grind their way back up, when in fact it is too easy. All you have to do is just spend every skillpoint into damage and get spread shot, split shot and life steal, the other last 2 don't matter too much, ammo drops far too often and mushrooms (yes, mushrooms) boost you too much.Over 6000 possible combinations of your attack? Around 50 useful ones, yeah. That's pretty much it.Only 1 save slot that gets deleted after you've beaten the game, that's just stupid.Having a pretty high firing rate with spread shot and split shot makes the game terribly lag, too.It's probably just me, but this game is for people who want to stop-by casually, who want to have fun for a few hours. It's definately not a challenging game at all, so I can't really recommend it from what I heard.			"

I'm not sure if they've fixed it by now but I wont bother going back to it.  I got the game because I heard it was difficult and had the random dungeon element.

												Slow, Repetative, EASY, boring, Still early access even though the page says otherwiseSummary: Recommended price: $3.00Grade: F (4/10)Gameply Time: Casual: 6-10 hoursStandard play-through: 5 hoursObjectives only: 2 hoursPro gamers objectives only: 1 hour or lessPixel Boy is just good enough to play it one time through, and that's only if you have nothing better to do. You know those games that aren't horrible enough to quit half way through, and you just feel like you need to finish it to get it over with? Pixel boy is that game. There is no challenge; as long as you keep enough money on you to repair armor you will never die. If you are the type of player who runs through rooms instead of clearing them one at a time, this game probably has a good pace for you, if you like it casual that is. I like to check every room and take it slow so-to-speak. but movement speed is a crawl even with speed modifiers and enemy attacks are even slower. Enemies are pretty standard Zelda clones. Predictable directional attacks and different speeds of melee attack Armor crafting is nothing special, type is based on the color you have the most of, there are no combinations beyond basic stats, for a roguelike this is disappointing, upgrading the tier only makes the basic stats more powerful. Weapon's don't ""Craft"" either, you can only add the listed effect to what you have already. don't expect spread shot and flaming pixels to give you a flame thrower or anything. At the end of the game you have easily 10-12 effects on one crafted powerup and you just face-roll over everything. You can only add one of each powerup to a crafted powerup. This is for balance but if the game was faster, and better such a craft would be right at home.Gameplay from start to finish for me was 5 1/2 hours, the rest of my recorded time was me getting up for food and bathroom. I consider myself a gamer of medium skill, if you are good and run through rooms you can easily beat this game in an hour. if you like it room by room like me prepare for a game lasting you 3 1/2 hours.

												I wanted to like Pixel Boy, I enjoy roguelikes and this game has all the right ingredients to make for a compelling game, unfortunately it fails to deliver in a lot of ways.The graphics are basic, they have tried to make something of the lo-fi RGB theme but in reality it just looks like exactly what it is: low poly everything masked with too much bloom and an unimaginative colour pallette. The gameplay is basic top down action fare, the controls are fairly well implemented but the moment to moment gameplay of moving and shooting is simply not that satisfying. Bullets waft out of your character and slowly float towards their target, enemies wander around in basic patterns often getting stuck in doorways and getting obscured by the scenery. The roguelike elements also fall short. Levels are randomly generated but in the most simplistic manner possible, essentially a grid of identical square rooms with the occasional corridor or removed walls. The enemies are picked from a pool at the start of the round, and while they are fairly varied there are never any great surprises. The customisation systems feel unecessarily micromanagey and don't afford any real variety. In short you aren't going to feel like you're getting much of a different experience when replaying the game, arguably the most important feature of roguelike games.Good points: the music is excellent, the narration is humorous and well voiced.

												Pixel Boy is an incomplete game and poorly balanced.Although pretty and unique in design the game fails at its two basic premises.Namely that if you are to believe that the Dungeon is ""ever expanding"" you will be disapointed to find that the game featured only 4 acts each containing 4 maps. The maps are further padded out by empty rooms and a slow movement rate.If you are to believe that the core mechanic of the game is to combine power-ups to create powerful combinations you will be disappointed to find that although combining power-ups is kind of fun and does make for great visuals, the ammo management required and the pure unnecessary nature of the power-ups (the game is easily beatable without them) actually impedes your progress more than aiding it.[Updated 11.07.2014]			"

												Pixel Boy is a game with a lot of failed potential, the core gameplay is fun but the bland environments, repitive enemies, lackluster bosses and simplistic crafting/progression system make Pixel boy a game not worth playing.I bought pixel boy because the trailer and screen shots looked exciting, the description promised a game with a lot of replay value and customization and the majority of reviews are positive. My first major disappointment was in learning that the weapon customization system was built around consumable powerups with 250 shots each, this leads to a lot of time spend managing ammo and switching to the basic shot type, rather then getting to use the different weapons. Which is a shame because the variety of weapon types and combinations are interesting and fun, but the limited ammo means you never get to really explore all the different options.My biggest issues with the game are the length and the difficulty. I beat the game on hardcore mode in about 3 hours, which felt like longer because the game really drags on. I felt little to no challenge after I was about 1/3 of the way through the game, and I only finished it because I felt like I had to. The game is composed of 4 acts of 4 levels each with a boss battle at the end of each act. There is no difference between any level, they are generated from a minimal set of rooms and populated with 4 randomly chosen monsters out of a fairly small set. The boss battles are a joke, the first boss is easy, but takes a long time to beat because of how under-powered you are at that point in the game, while the last 3 bosses can each be beaten in a matter of seconds.With a little bit of reworking of the progression system, an actual sense of difficulty and some more variety the game could be fun but as it stands it is a fairly dull game with hints of potential for something more. As far as I can tell from the steam page the game is not in early access or anything and the last update by the developers was over 5 months ago, so I don't hold out hope that the game will get better.I bought pixel boy for about 10$ and I would say it was worth about 25% of that. I would only recommend pixel boy if you can put up with the issues described above and the game is on sale for at least 50% off.			"

												New Stuff:Ok, changing my mind about recommending this game.It's fun, yes ... BUT it pretty much seems dead.""Daily Dungeons (coming soon)"" probably won't come. The last time there was any change is now about 2 Months ago.So, guessing the promises were false ones, it's not worth the full price.Old Stuff:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A short, colorful and fun game.To get through, you need a little bit of ressource management (Ammo can only be replenished in the town).Played it twice, in the second run I didn't bother with Armor at all, as it isn't really efficent or needed.Right now, I just wait for Daily Dungeon (the Game Menu states ""coming soon"") and hoping I will find a more challenging experience there.Everyone who is frustrated with other Dungeon Crawlers should check this one out, as it is quite forgiving.For those, who appearently find this game hard:Every time you collected the RGB-Key, you can use the elevator (before opening the ""Danger""-Doors) to go to the Town.Going to Town heals you.Combining Weapons also replenish their Ammunition. So if you have a lvl.6 Weapon with 1 shot left, you can combine it with something and get a lvl.7 Weapon with full ammo.Don't waste your Attribute-Points. The only needed ones are Health, Damage and Range. (@Devs: Do something against that :P)If you tend to die: In a Dungeon, run to the ""End""-Room first (its always displayed on the map) there you can buy a health potion for 30 Gold. Always have a secure way to this room and run back to it, when your low on HP.As soon as possible, I run around with 4 identical Weapons and use only 2 of them. If for some reason I am low on ammo (never happened) I can switch to the other ones. (Later in the Game I have 6 and use 3 of them)NEVER use the last shot in a weapon! It vanishes into thin air. Stop using it and replenish the Ammo once you're in the city.The Best Weapons seem to be: Life Steal, Fire, Spread shot and Heat Seeking. At some Point, you can eliminate a Room with 1 shot.			"

												This game has potential. I played it and i liked it, but it crashed and crashed again. It has AMAZING graphics however. I really have a hard time not reccomending this, but it's unplayable...			"

												The controls are slightly unresponsive, and the worst part comes when you die. All the amazing powerups you collected while going through the dungeons are ALL lost along with everything else in your inventory when you die. When I die, I just don't want to play anymore because all my powerups are gone. And death comes fairly easily, too, once you get to maybe level 4, and you have enemies just spraying bullets everywhere at you.			"
