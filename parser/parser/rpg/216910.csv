												*sigh* Of Orcs And Men..where do I start ~ http://www.oforcsandmen.com/index.php?lang=en&rub=game (their website might give you more impressions) To be honest, I probably would have never played this game if Frosty hadn't gifted it to me. But I am pleased that he did! I was interested a long time in this game, but never felt to buy it - which would have been a huge mistake. When I got thrown in the world of Orcs And Men I felt a little lost.. the controls are very clunky though the tutorials were helping a lot. Anyway the game is basically about a war between Orcs, Goblins, Wizards, Humans and some other races, and you get to play as the main protagonist Arkhail who's a member of the Bloodjaws after leaving his old clan / family (I wont spoil anything important here).  He later on meets the unique Goblin Styx (a lone wolf) who's told to show Arkhail the way to accomplish his mission to make an end to this War. But everything gets out of control and the two find themselves in a ~10 hour long Journey full of twists and mixed up game play: Styx -rather small and fast -  is a master of stealth and you got the option to get 1-3 enemies out of the way quietly before entering a fight. Arkhail on the other hand is big and slow but with powerful attacks when things get real. So the game play styles of both together were the best possible combination to me in a game like that... though i preferred to play Styx :3 The characters of both could not be more different.. Styx is more grumpy and pessimistic / afraid due big challenges while Arkhail is willing to die for his cause / clan in Honor.This gets especially clear during several of the amazing cutscenes and dialogues where you got sometimes the option to chose whether Styx or Arkhail answer / choose their own way (for example: Trust someone or Kill stuff -Arkhail / not trust someone and flee - Styx ) I loved this game...it lacks in a lot of things because its very very and I mean VERY linear..not much to explore on 1 path besides the main each mission but it fits the game somehow.. I cant even tell why I like it so much - but what I know, is that the music is AWESOME! it changes during calm situations and fights and its just amazing in my opinion x) the setting is beautiful if you don't care too much about graphics - they are nice and enough for a game like that - the atmosphere created is of course subjective but I can recommend most of the time. To sum this up.. game play might not be the best but the game plays well, graphics are neither too low nor to high and RPG fans shouldn't bother anyway, Story was interesting though the ending could have been implemented better :D If you are a fan of linear RPG's with a rather short but Interesting Story + setting this game might be worth your time if you grab it on a sale for ~ 7 bucks 'Styx: Master of the Shadows' is the Prequel to this game and I'll play it now with a Joy!Hope you didn't have a hard time reading and the review was helpful :) Have a good day folks!

												Of Orcs and Men is third-person action RPG from Cyanide and Spiders, the minds behind Mars: War Logs, Aarklash Legacy, Bound by Flame, Blood Bowl and many others.  The closest analogy in design and mechanics to this game would probably be Mass Effect 1.Turning the genre on it's head, instead of playing the plucky human fighting evil, you play as a duo of “greenskins”, an enormous Orc name Arkail and a small Goblin named Styx fighting the evil human empire intent on wiping you out.  Both characters, especially Styx, are endlessly entertaining, Styx the comic foil to Arkail's enduring determined colossus.  There is an admirable literary quality here, not just good vs. evil, though the fact that every third line contains the f-word can at times see it return it to baser roots.  Both character can take part in conversations in the now standard “Bioware” dialogue wheel and choosing which character talks can result in wildly varying outcomes.Each main character has three combat stances, Attack/special/defense for Arkail and Melee/special/ranged for Styx.  Hitting the right shoulder button on the controller allows you to slow time to a crawl and select your various abilities and queue up to 4 at a time on each character.  Both characters have a resource to manage, Styx uses concentration to power his abilities, use it too quickly and he is left with only an auto-attack while it recharges.  Arkail however uses rage.  Use too many offensive attacks too quickly and he can go berserk, doing huge amounts of damage, but becoming more vulnerable to attack and sometimes even killing Styx!  Arkail's defensive stance slows the rage buildup, but he also does less damage.Arkail and Styx are a duo and they function best when they work together.  The best strategy I found was to use Arkail in his defensive stance to group taunt everyone and then stun them while Styx would go around debuffing/poisoning and finishing them off one by one.  As you level up each character gets an additional point that can be used to either buy a new ability or upgrade one with the addition of a choice of effect.  Later in the game each character can choose an “advanced” class adding 3 further abilities to their special stance tree.  There is an impressive number of skills and strategies to use and at higher difficulty levels you will need them!Maybe the most important strategy is using Styx's stealth ability.  Large groups of enemies can be thinned out before a fight by having Styx go into stealth mode and assassinate enemies at the edges.  But watch out for dogs, they can smell Styx coming!The game isn't particularly loot heavy.  While each character has a weapon, gloves, top, pants and accessory slot, there are at most 6 or so different armor sets and weapons for each character in the game.  You are also able to buy an upgrade for each item and you should do this as early as possible.  This is not an easy game and a full set of upgraded gear will provide a noticeable lift in you damage output and survivability. The graphics are very decent, though maybe not as sharp as they could be, but the character models of the two mains are fantastic, Styx especially.  The voice acting is patchy, Arkail and Styx are great so are most of the Orc's but some of the humans are pretty average.  The game also has a very nice classical score though at times the mood of the music seemed a little out with what was going on on screen. While not particularly long, 12 hours give or take, the ambition and new experience it offers makes this a very worthy addition to the Action RPG genre and Styx apparently has his own spin-off game coming soon!8.5/10			"

												It is certainly... interesting.This game comes with some unique and very intruiging aspects, but also a considerable amount of downfalls.The gameplay is solid, but at times somewhat inadequate. The storyline is pretty good, but could have been better. The characters have a lot of potential, but don't really grow as much as they could have. The graphics are excellent, but the facial animation is often off-key. The voice acting is at times very good, and at times not so much.All that said, I had good fun with the game. In the end, that's what's most important, no?Should you buy it? If it's on discount, go for it. You might just find yourself pleasantly surprised at the unortodox lead characters and the different take on the classic fantasy settings. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but I think that past its flaws, it is an experience worth having.			"

												There are plenty of stories out there that put you in control of Orcs, but few do the fearsome race justice. 'Of Orcs and Men' does what other titles in the genre fail to achieve: it makes you see what it's like to be a hulking beast of rage and muscle. As the warrior Arkail, one of the main gameplay mechanics is to manage your bloodlust - if you let it get the better of you, Arkail will go on a blind, murderous rampage. While he amps up his damage this way, you can only watch on helplessly as he makes poor tactical decisions, exposes himself needlessly to enemy fire, and even turns on his constant Goblin ally (who you also control). Built around this unique idea is a rich story adhering to a fitting theme - that of Orcs being enslaved as beasts of burden by human masters.The combat is handled by queueing up your next attacks, reminiscent of the system from Knights of the Old Republic. This may push the patience of those wanting more immediate and visceral action, but it works well enough to get you through the entire adventure. With sharp writing and characters you grow attached to, this is a unique experience that deserves a lot more attention than it received. Unleash your inner berserker and give this revolution a shot - whatever happens, at least you know you'll go down fighting.			"

												A short budget RPG that doesn't overstay its welcome. Tells a neat story with a few twists and turns and stays on course with the story even with the sidequests. Pretty much 100% linear with all missions pretty much being ""go there and kill everything"", but combat is fun enough to make it not matter. Each character can also be built in a combination of different ways so there can be replayability if you wanted to try a different combat style. No complaints about the graphics, writing, or voice acting for the most part. Styx is probably the best character I've seen in a long while. Only thing that really felt wrong about the game are its dead environments. As with other Spiders studio games, towns are full of people that just stand there and do nothing, and you have pretty much zero interaction with the environment besides looting a glowing chest once every couple of maps. Itemization is interesting in that there are very few items, but most items even from the beginning of the game are completely viable to endgame. Only difference is the stat bonuses they give you, and you customize your gear based on your preferred combat style. Very interesting design choice.			"

												Clearly an underdog, this game is better than it seems. The main attraction is the story and original setting, playing as orc and goblin against the humain oppression.PROS- Overall good story and dialogues- Over 16 hours of gameplay if you don't play on easy- Overall nice graphicsCONS- Uninteresting items- Average combat system, interesting on paper but should have been better for a game focused on combat like this one- Some not too serious technical problems like the camera not cooperating sometimesREVIEWThis looked like a barely average game at first. But I was pleasantly surprised. The story is well tied together, the characters are generally well written and well fleshed out, and even the dialogues and exchanges between characters are well done.The main downside of this game is that for something so axed on combats, it should have had more items, more skill involved in combat rather than using the mmo system of selecting targets and queuing actions, and the combat itself should have been better tailored to feel more authentic and fast paced. Don't get me wrong, the combat is decent, it just could have been better.It also lacks depth in some aspects, like for the character stats for example. There doesn't seem an alternative to putting all points into stamina on orc and all on damage for the goblin, the harder difficulty you go the more obvious it becomes that there is only one viable build.All in all I do recommend this game, it is good value if you get it on a sale.

It's really something else. Beyond that not everyone's going to like it.
But those of you who will, will be enjoying every moment of the game.Developer: Cyanide Studio - Spiders StudiosPublisher: Focus Home InteractiveRelease Date: 11 October, 2012Different. That’s the word I’d use to describe Of Orcs and Men.StoryLet’s take a quick look at RPG games in general.If I’d ask you ‘bout the features of a typical RPG game you’d probably start by saying Hero,And you’d be correct but that on this case. Of Orcs and Men is not a Story about Heroes or the forces of good. I mean, correct me if I’m wrong, but when was the last time an Orc or a Goblin was a Hero? Usually we face them with anger, hatred and their sole purpose is to  make us feel heroic by slaughtering them. Not to mention they’re stupid, dumb and lack general intelligence. Not in most case but usually they’re just stupid.Not in this case. While I’m not going ahead to say our two, let’s just go ahead and call em Heroes for the sake of RPGs, are real Einsteins or whatnot but they’re certainly examples which happened to grow on me. Especially Styx.Let me introduce you our two Heroes. In the red corner we have a Arkail. A member of the Blood Jaws. A Rebel if you want to call him that. You might be wondering why so let me explain.The Story in this game is unlike others. Usually you’re one of the good races and you have to stop the Orcs from ravaging the lands and slaughter your Wife and unborn Child. That’s how the Story involving Orcs usually goes.In Of Orcs and Men you seek revenge. A tyrannical human empire is the ruler of all and thus our beloved Greenskins, as they’re called, are now being persecuted and enslaved and it’s up to Arkail, an Orc which I’d describe as the Hulk of all Orcs, and his companion Styx, a Goblin. Their goal is free the Greenskins by assassinating the human emperor.So you see it’s a different concept. Which, personally, I happened to like.CharactersI talked a bit ‘bout Arkail so let’s talk about Styx. Well Styx’s one of a kind. Besides him, no one has ever seen any Goblin speak or shown any signs of intelligence. So he’s one of a kind.While Arkail is the muscle, Styx would be best to described as the brain. To an extent.What that means is, while Arkail wants to let his rage free way, and literally become the Hulk and kill everything he lays eyes upon, that also includes Styx, our one of a kind Goblin on the other hand rather relies on his way of handling things: Stealth and Assassination.GameplayYou control Arkail and Styx on the click of a button. Both have two stances, so two ways of attacking. Arkail has an offensive stance, which of course, has damage oriented skills and the defensive stance and skill sets. I talked ‘bout Arkail being the Hulkbefore so let’s talk about that. He has a Rage mechanic. What that means is that there’ll be rage building up and once he has build up the rage he will target any enemy he sees and becomes uncontrollable. That also includes Styx. So beware. Once he’s in his rage you’re best bet is to get some distance between those two or else Styx will get downed rather quick.Styx on the other hand is your typical thief with hand-to-hand, dagger, combat skills and a ranged set where he relies on throwing knifes. Beyond that he can enter stealth stance so he’s able to pick off unaware enemies and even the odds.They both can also work together so Arkail can throw Styx, for example, on enemies or Styx can pass Arkail a bottle which boosts his health regeneration in battle.AtmosphereExcuse me for the following:Of Orcs and Men seems to be one ♥♥♥♥ing good game where the ♥♥♥♥ing characters talk like ♥♥♥♥ing drunken sailors.Well the game’s not afraid to use adult language. To be quite honest, while it might be not for everyone, I do believe it fits the game perfectly. Keep in mind we’re ♥♥♥♥ing talking ‘bout a ♥♥♥♥ing big ol’ green Orc and a ♥♥♥♥ing lil’ Goblin.The voice acting of the key characters is quite good but … everyone else seems to be lacking some effort.DifficultySo here’s the thing. The game has four difficulties. Personally I’ve been playing on Extreme from the get go, since I always enjoy playing on the hardest difficulty first, and let me tell you this.This game is hard. Not even kidding. So I can only imagine how easy it’d be on a lower difficulty.So that could be a reason why a lot of people don’t enjoy the game. It does have a learning curve and, despite playing two usually dumb and stupid characters, you’ve to think ‘bout how you want to approach the situation.What else can I ♥♥♥♥ing say?The game is for a specific crowd. Let’s start by saying this. It’s certainly not for everybody but for those of you who’re interested in the game and for those of you who’re not afraid of a real challenging game … It’ll grow on you. I certainly enjoy it. Special thanks to the dialogues I certainly enjoyed those.I'd really say you should give this game a try. It's certainly not bad. It's just something else.			"

												This game is one of the greatest underappreciated gems I have had the pleasure of finding in a long time. There are obvious things that sully the experience a bit, but given this is the effort of small studio on a tight budget these aren't hard to look past.The story takes a twist on typical fantasy by having orcs being oppressed and subjegated by humans, and in light of this, your main character is on a quest to kill the emperor who seeks to unite elves and dwarves against ""the greenskins.""The main character is Arkail, or the ""butcher"" as he has been dubbed after a bloody masacre in his past. What's great here is that this story element actually works into the gameplay. As you take damage your rage meter builds, and if you don't use skills to keep your calm he becomes enraged. In this state, he more powerful but reckless and uncontrollable, attacking foes in random order.Evening this out is his original odd couple partner in crime, Styx. He is a goblin assassin, the only one of his race who can speak or display any intelligence at all. He causes bleeds, poisons and lowers defense in combat, and out of combat he small stealth sections where he dispatches as many soldiers as he can before things eventually fall to pieces.The story is well surprisingly well written considering every other line of dialogue has a swear word, because it fits into the narrative and general feeling of the story. I was honestly surprized at myself when I started the characters, admiring the way the duo chirped eachother and eventually grew into a like-minded friendship. Combat slows down when you pause so you can plan each of their actions, and everything works quite well. The graphics are nice enough and the game has a surprizingly good soundtrack that hits all the right notes when a sad or intense situation takes rise.Sadly, there are some issues, though they are just a lot of nitpicks that don't effect the solid feel of gameplay. Character models don't sync up in most cutscenes, a weapon constantly floats in air against Ark's back, voice acting apart from the main duo is largely sub-par. You are told of great battles going on in other places due to what's happening in the story and can't be there because the game's budget wouldn't allow it, and some people might not like how the stealth sections work. You essentially sneak around and kill guards in order of which would be able to see the act from their FOV, the ai will walk past dead bodies without raising alarm which seems silly but is also necessary to that element of gameplay. This is a stop motion turn based rpg first, the stealth is more like a small minigame that you are never actually forced to do that makes fights easier.Past that, there are a bunch of sidequests which never feel pointless as the duo banter and you find out more meaningful things about the story. I'm not usually someone who likes sidequests but it worked well for me. You have a mission hub in different zones and when you pick a mission it is generally linear except for a few hidden treasures. There's a couple of choices to be made in the game that have small outcomes on story, but nothing with permanance.All and all, the flaws take you out of the experience in a small fathom but do little to stop this extremely charming game from taking your heart. The prequel, Styx:Master of shadows is out soon, and I can't wait to delve again into this world again, and see how much the studio has grown since their time between the titles.9/10   There's nitpicks, but the story, the gameplay and the pacing are all great and a low budget doesn't change that.Edit: Fixed a couple errors, special thanks to Snapfit for calling me out on goofing the main character's name and thanks for all the positive feedback on my review.

												The fantasy world earns yet another entry with Focus Home Interactive's Of Orcs and Men, a story of resolve, tolerance, and genocide. Here, humans vie for power at the cost of content tribal cultures to the south. Players take control of a two-person party in which they can focus on stealth and ranged combat or tanky, melee combat.Of Orcs and Men follows Arkail, a short-tempered orc fighter suffering from PTSD, and Styx, the only speaking goblin anyone's ever found. The nefarious humans have decided that their lands simply weren't expansive enough, so they've begun an onslaught on the orc lands. Arkail's chief has entrusted him and a few others with launching covert missions to assassinate the emperor before he enlists the help of the dwarves and elves. A proud and dutiful orc, Arkail sets forth to complete his mission. Along the way, he encounters Styx, a sly goblin who has been paid to guide Arkail on his path.Styx and Arkail appear to be polar opposites at the onset of the story – Styx works for money and has a way with words, while Arkail's principles and loyalty are matched only by his uncontrollable rage. The mature script communicates realistically and tastefully. Our protagonists, despite their differences, work well off of each other, both in how they meet their goals and in how they interact.This third-person action RPG, as stated earlier, follows our two ""greenskins"" around narrow corridors, even if the environment calls for spacious arenas. Players can freely switch between the two, though many may find themselves sticking with Styx, since he can stealthily assassinate loitering soldiers and inquisitors using his sneak ability. In this way, many battles can seem like puzzles: how can I optimize my killing potential in order to do less actual fighting?If and when combat begins, the wrecking ball Arkail can choose offensive, defensive, or special abilities. Primarily a melee fighter, Arkail has a rage bar that fills up over time, and if it reaches its threshold, he enters a chaotic mode in which anyone and everyone in his path will be pulverized over the duration of his now-decreasing rage bar – including Styx. Don't get too excited, because special abilities are quite limited, with a few interesting choices that are only unlocked right before the end of the game.Alternatively, offensive and defensive abilities offer a diverse toolbox with which to stab and bash opponents. Upon leveling, new skills can be unlocked, and old ones can be upgraded. When upgrading, two choices are available, and players can only pick one permanently.During almost the entire game, players will find themselves running through long, beautiful caverns or halls for twenty seconds or so, notice that the game is quick saving, and then hit stealth mode to murder a couple of the languid foes ahead. Repeat. Unfortunately, customization is a one-time deal in that most situations can be resolved in much the same way. Thus, much of the game feels like going through the motions, and I could never sit through it for more than a couple hours at a time.That said, Of Orcs and Men at least keeps its environments visually stimulating with countless details and extraordinary graphics. Never before have I been so intrigued by the intricate details on a character's skin. The textures on Arkail's body demand inspection at first, with each dimple, curve, and scar reflecting perfectly in all sorts of lighting with myriad shades. Similarly, leather looks like the real deal with its waxy surface and creases.Since the game follows Arkail and Styx throughout, one might expect expert voice acting from our heroes. Non-playable characters' voice actors, however, are not always up to the task. While I believed almost every word that came out of our orcish allies, I occasionally raised an eyebrow when a sidequestrian spoke. Combat never missed a beat with typical metal-against-metal and piercing sounds maintaining the bubble of immersion. Musically, the use of violins was a welcome change from the standard horn affair one expects from this sort of game.In terms of control, glitchy camera issues reared their head when players chose to fight against a wall. Targeting was a chore as well, since battles could include nearly twenty enemies if players aren't savvy enough with assassination.Of Orcs and Men feels like a missed opportunity. Action RPGs tend to be gameplay-driven rather than story-driven, and this game is no exception. All of the trappings are there: visuals, voice acting, script, likable characters, and novel game design ideas. However, the game falters in its execution of those ideas, and one misstep can mean tumbling down a tall tower. Fortunately, like our stalwart heroes, such a long, hard fall doesn't obliterate the game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It has a really unique take on a fantasy setting and I wanted to press through and see it come to a great end that justifies its slow start. Didn't happen. The game controls like complete garbage. I found myself constantly frustrated by one of my characters either standing still getting beat on or conversely, sprinting off at a random group of enemies half the map away from the current battle. You can do every side quest and explore every corner but random difficulty spikes will slap you down and left me scratching my head about how I could conceivably progress. I can give a recommendation with a qualification if you want to run through on easy and see how the story goes but other than that Of Orcs and Men isn't worth your time. There are better games to be played than this unenjoyable slog.			"

												This game is a 7.99/10. Worth around $22-25. Got 14 hours out of it, 75/80% off all achievments, could get I guess around 20 if I tried to beat the game on highest difficulty.Story: The world was interesting, and the main characters were too. Their personalities played off each other well, and had me in stiches the whole time. Unfortunatly, the side characters and villians were pretty much 1-dimension. It was hard to be attached to them, or be even interested in them.World:Interesting, but nothing special or awestrucking. Seems to be semi-linear, but if you look at all the maps carfeully, there's like 8 versions of linear paths, just angled differently or starting in different areas, thus making it really really liner. If you don't analyze maps alot, then it's semi linear for you. Occasionally some invisble walls in the enviroment, that were probably accidently left in the game, because they're as thin as a pencil. Annoying in combat, but rare. Occured 5 times.User Interface:Basic, which first seemed worrysome. Later on, I realized this made the gameplay easier, as meant less time spent on micromanaging, and nothing to slowdown the game speed. Helped by making only one, basic currency. Trade points. Ex: 2 points for a sword at most, 1 point to upgrade, one point gained to sell it back.Graphics:Mostly good, for a 2012 game. Occasionly some hiccups, nothing to worry.Audio:Usually the most underrated part of a game. The voices sounded crisp, no hiccups. They put alot of effort in the quality of music. Some of it is memorable, and fitted well with the enviroment/combat. Lip synce issues were annoying at first, but you eventually ignored it. Later on in the game, it smoothes itself out.Combat:A basic version of Dragon Age 1's combat system. Some options of equipment, but not much. The main characters combat roles play off each other well, with the Orc being a tank/bezerker and the Goblin being a rogue/assassin. Whenever you only had the chance to play one in a combat setting, you're made to realize that they need each other, and can't function well alone. Most be a good message hidden there.This games need a sequel. Actually, would be okay with a properly done trilogy.			"

												One of the best and original games I´ve played in  a long while. The story was captivating, the music gave me chills, the combat, well, I would describe it as the thinking mans dragon age. It obviously had flaws, the biggest was that there was too little of everything. I finished it in about 13 hours and am left dreaming of a sequel. I noticed this game just around the time it came out, but  waited with a buy until it was discounted and sat on it for even longer as I had read so much negative feedback beforehand. I wish I could go back in time, buy it at release to support the studio, and get on the barricades to defend it against all the flaming. I can understand a lot of the critisicm, however I think it all boils down to this game being unaccessable to a lot of people due to the challenge of the combat system, and the game being marketed in a way that perhaps fooled people it was a more action-oriented game with a bigger budget. The trailer kind of looked like gears of war with orcs, to be honest.I could write a lot about this game but will just summarize the main points;I enjoyed the combat, allthough a little unforgiving at some points, it did let me think up different tactics for different battles. The skills were fun and there were a few easier patches that let you feel powerful. Gear managment was a little thin but worked okay. Leveling your characters was business as usual with stat and skill points, with some new intresting bits such as deflection and stability. The game looks and plays beautifully. Encountered only a few minor glitches (perhaps it has been patched a bit?). Voice acting quality varied throughout the game from excellent (main characters) to crappy, but I only disliked a few of the actors.The bad? ""Corridor running"" which I did not really mind, as I enjoyed the combat and the quests.Slow paced combat, so be prepared if you don´t like that sort of thing. Lack of in-game cinematics or at least more cinematic finishes to some of the more epic events, which left some anti-climatic feelings at parts. And in the end, a lack of budget? If there would have been some more time and resources to flesh more stuff out, this could have been a dragon age killing tripple A.I can´t help but picturing a sequel of magnitude, with deeper tactical combat, different character choices, a more open world with continuation of the story.

												The story is pretty cool, it is quite rare to be on the side of the orcs in a game, and I loved it. The music is good too. The combat system is out of the ordinary since you decide actions between two characters at the same time, but they pulled it off nicely by doing a slo-mo during the selection, and you won't have any problem with it after your first real combat. The game is about 20-25 hours, you can change your gear and there are special stats on them so you rarely feel compelled to throw anything away, so you can always change your tactics depending on the ennemies.Do recommend!

												Very enjoyable game. Having to use both characters (each with their own strengths and weaknesses) to survive most combat encounters was interesting. Auto save timing seemed perfect, never having to go back too far if you failed the encounter. The game also does a pretty good job of telling it's story. My only complaint would be the lack of decent equipment drops once you get about 1/2 through the game. I guess this is to keep the player from being too OP.  Ran flawlessly for me, no issues at all			"

												Dont you ever get sick of the hate towards orcs and goblins? Being always the evil force in games? Well dont know about you but I do,thats for sure. And OOAM let me kill humans now... how refreshing .Story,Quests and LevelsYou are Arkail,fearsome orc,who is apointed with the assassination of the Emperor. In your journey you will be lead by Styx,master of stealth and assassination. Story is linear with here and there some decision making. At 2-3 points you will end up in hub-like area from which you can get different side quests to complete and improve yourself. The levels you will find are linear,each of them separated in ""zones"" .  There isnt much of exploration which can be bad or good depending on the player.RPG elementsWell you can equip your characters with some items and pick skills everytime they level up. Later in the game you are given 2 options per character to specialize them. Nothing to deep. Its simple but its doing its job in the game.CombatCombat is in 2 phases(or if you are good enough you can pick just one of them):1st. Stealth: you put Arkail in some spots save and use Styx to wonder around and kill guards without being seen. It takes time but make Phase 2 much easier... talking about phase 2.2.Once detected every guard from the ""zone"" will charge at you and fun time starts. Combat is action-based,there isnt pause button to set a lineup of skills for the orc and goblin to use. Instead you are given slow-motion button so you have to be fast with selecting targets and skills.  Combat needs sometime to get used to it. One thing that you should have in mind, Arkail got a berserk stance, while he do and takes dmg berserk fills and once full he goes all nuts,take less dmg,deals more dmg and attacks everything that moves... even Styx so run for the hills if this happens.ReplayabilityOnly reason to replay the game is to pick different decisions at places but for most people even one playthrough will be good enough.OverallA nice and solid RPG with interesting combat and story to tell.

												Writing this review a long time after actually playing the game, but here goes. The game had ♥♥♥♥ poor marketing, so I feel it my duty to give it a voice, however small.It's a flawed little gem of grim-bright fantasy that explores some interesting concepts that you'll find most RPG's don't play with like:A soundtrack that isn't identical to LoTR (and is trully one of a kind)A dialog system that allows you to control both party members and who talks in an encounter -(God I wish there was another RPG that let this happen)A story told from the perspective of ""the bad guys"", the Orcs!-the characters are good, some are more unique than others-The setting looks high fantasy but it has some pretty grim dialogue/story (slavery, genocide, racism)--Magic in this setting is more subtle (akin to Gandalf in LoTR, rather than your avg WoW fireball slinging-mage) which has its own charmA combat system that has unique features and doesn't feel canned-the mechanics behind your main brawler is HILARIOUS, he can go ape-♥♥♥♥-crazy and start to pick ♥♥♥♥ers up and breaking their spine. Including your goblin buddy! (This mechanic actually makes the combat refreshing, the loss of control isn't bad if you just know how to use it to your advantage.)-You'll feel massive changes when fighting heavily armored knights vs your average guardSo what are the flaws?The game has a short run-time, for an RPG. You can blast through it fairly quick and feel satisfied. The combat system has quite a bit of jargon, sometimes you'll resort to just queueing up attacks and hope for the best-Eventually you master it and it becomes pretty easyThe gear choices are sparse, and often won't feel like they make significant changes to your characterThe stealth is ham handed and is much less satisfying than the combat. The branch-off to this game (Styx: Master of Shadows) does the stealth much better.Its likely going to be priced very low so you should give it a chance. Trust me, there's things to love in the game.			"

												I bought this game expecting nothing really and I must say it took me by surprise. Even though the graphics isn't cutting edge I think the great enviroments, level system and change of opponents made a great combination that you didn't get tired off. It took me 14 hours to play through and I think it was worth it. It can also be noted that the main characters are (even if they are very stereotype) had interesting and exiting character development during the game which made the story interesting. This is one of the better fantasy role-playing games I've played thanks to it's simplicity, because it's not a free world game like the Elder Scrolls or Dragon Age but I like it when I only got one way to go and smash anything comming in my way!

												Of Orcs and Men is a game that you will either love or hate. If you can forgive the initial awkwardness of the combat and the linier corridor like levels, what you will find is a rich and rewarding, well-acted story that turns the men good orcs evil premise of almost the past 20 years on its head. The two main leads really pull you into the story and once you find the flow of the combat, it becomes almost second nature, demanding a little tactical thinking to win. I can’t recommend this game highly enough. It finished leaving me wanting more with a lot of great memories of my time in its world.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Cyanide Studio – Spider StudiosPublishers: Focus Home InteractiveInitial release: Oct 2012Genre: quasi-CRPG, Active Timer queued Combat, Dungeon Crawler#Worth/NotWorth: #ILikeThisGameButICantOutrightRecommendBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Unbalanced, 2 person party dungeon crawler in the vain of a Dragon Age or a KOTOR in a relatively generic fantasy world but has decent character development.Exposition, Concurrence and SummationAnother sideways thumbOf Orcs and Men is a two person party dungeon crawler for most intents and purposes. You control both the Orc-- Arkail and the goblin-- Styx. So from the onset you have very established characters both in terms of personality and style of play. The holy trinity of RPG tropes of Tank, DPS and Healer now are taken by only two which can be problematic. Styx is the tiny DPS stealth based rogue character and Arkail is the brooding angry Orc with a heart even the most honorable warrior doesn't posses. I have heard many complaints that the combat is why they put the game down as it was not direct enough for them. I suppose if you draw from the archetype of what an Orc is you might expect a sort of “Push button to smash face” setup. But I bet you wont see those same people complain about identical combat in a game like Knights of the Old Republic. It's queued actions with active pause and it works just fine, not to mention if you use Styx stealth stance you are granted the ability to sneak into enemy territory and assassinate enemies that don't know you are there.. except dogs.  The gameplay loop is basically start in a HUB wherein you can shop for new gear or upgrade existing gear. Talk to some people and then start a mission. The maps are very linear and almost behave like an a solo instance in an MMO. You basically must traverse a hallway towards the X. There is almost no loot to be had in the environment making exploration trivial and almost discouraged. The few things that are found in the environment are emblazoned with a glowing effect that stick out like an oasis in a desert. Additionally, upon picking up the gear it auto-magically goes into the appropriate persons inventory.The game almost feels a bit dumbed down. As there is no real currency. You can't sell old gear for money to buy potions for instance; there isn't a need to. Both Arkail and Styx regen health very quickly out of battle. However you get “trade points” to be used in order to buy potentially better gear or to upgrade your current gear. There isn't even a system to have extra money to say persuade a guard or something which seems like something Styx would be quite akin to. I really enjoyed the gameplay loop. I enjoyed and like the characters; they are well voice acted and have roles and personalities. But the game is totally unbalanced. There where fights that really seemed like boss fights that I breezed through without even establishing a strategy while other fights, fights of attrition if you will that seemed borderline impossible and I couldn't overcome without micro managing  every single hit and action. THE GISTAn enjoyable dungeon crawler, I hesitate to call it casual because it does have some depth but it's rather unbalanced in places and I cannot fully recommend.Follow my curation for more "

A nice solid RPG framework for a potentially great franchise.Now, the small scope makes me think of this game as sort of like a B-list movie. That's not a bad thing actually. It's almost like an indie RPG but it's definitely not since they've got big Publisher support. It makes the game feel well rounded and solid. The devs knew what they wanted to make and they did so splendidly. It's a budget title so to speak.The game uses my favorite combat style of queuing up actions and attacks either in real-time or in paused time (but in this game's case - slowed time) much like Knights of the Old Republic or Neverwinter Nights. And the combat is fantastic by the way. It's definitely challenging since every attack is deliberate and damaging to both your characters and the enemies. What I mean by that is the enemies usually come in packs and can easily interrupt, stun, and then kill your party if your not careful. The levels actually reinforce the idea of planning. The levels are mostly straight corridors that are dotted with wide open arenas. You can approach them stealthly or guns blazing.Now, I should mention that you've only got two playable characters, Arkail the big orc and Styx the obviously rogue goblin. The customization is kind of limited. The game's got small skill trees, obvious shiny loot sacks, and (to the devs credit) upgradeable gear. It's obvious that your party is going to turn out with the orc as your tank and the goblin is either your range or melee DPS. But an interesting thing about the orc is you can lose control of him since he has a rage meter. The rage meter also acts as the orc's ""mana"" to activate certain skills though. So you can imagine how your going to plan out your fights with that in mind.Their story and that of the game's story is actually your typical fantasy. You got your orcs, goblins, mages, fanatical religious orders, and later on a brief appearance by the Elves and Dwarves. Basically, the story is that the orcs are being enslaved by a cruel human empire. Your story is to lead Arkail and Styx on a suicide mission to kill the human emperor. It's a nice story and the world is really interesting. It's got this typical western european medieval look to it. But the Orcish perspective help in sucking me in to the game's world. However, the dialogue and the voice acting is pretty bad. The swearing is so out of place. It's like the devs were trying to be edgy but just failed with the translation from the original french script. There is a dialogue system. But it's there to either get more lore to choose which side quest to take.The graphical fidelity is also pretty great. The character models of the orcs & goblins plus the later levels look stunning especially with an obvious budget title. And the soundtrack is also great. I would definitely buy it.All-in-all, the game's a fairly decent RPG from two studios who would later on make some fairly decent RPG's with the same combat system. I love the combat and the Orcish perspective on a typical fantasy world is refreshing experience. And if your aching for a solid and almost indie like RPG, then buy this game. If your on the fence, then buying at a discount is always a good idea.PC Port NOTES: It ran well on my amd fx 6 core and amd hd7850 on max settings with little to no performance hiccups and a steady 60 fps. Nothing game breaking here. Hell, alt+tab even works (no borderless windowed mode though). The devs also later on removed some horrible DRM. Also, the game does have some decent graphical options. Another thing is that mouse and keyboard is playable but the keys are non-rebindable.			"

												I enjoed the game alot and found it worth the price its asking for.The Good:1) The medieval fantasy nature of the game is quite charismatic.2) Story is interesting enough and has its twists.3) Script for the characters are good. Believable and enjoyable.4) Graphics are good.5) Musics are good.6) The game kept me entertained long and well enough for its price.The Bad:1) I personally dislike the combat style. It very similar to dragon age and I found it slow and painful to play at time.2) Zero replay value.3) Poorly planned unskippable cut scenes. Prevents players from saving before making certain decisions in the game which is bad since I like to load games again and see what happens on the other choice.4) Balancing has abit of issue. Some battles are far too challenging compared to others that it sticks out like a sore thumb. Its fine if the game is progressively more challenging but it has many battles that are suddenly much more difficulty than the ones before or after it.Despite the complains I still enjoeyd the game and found it very charismatic and memorable. Seeing that very few people has bought and played, I'll love list it under a cult classic except its unique enough to deserve the title.			"

												Personal Rating: Wasted PotentialClassic Rating: ★★✬☆☆A nice story line can't make up for a bland gameplay.The story behind ""Of Orcs And Men"" is quite interesting, given that you'll play as a Warrior Orc trying to kill the Human Emperor; a fellow Goblin, who is one of a kind, named Styx, will guide and assist you with his assassination and stealth skills.While the story looks appealing, as i was saying, gameplay is really boring (I played 7 hrs and it's been the same from the beginning): what you do is simply advance from area to area - they also look very similar one to the other - and kill a group of enemies. Rinse repeat. Stix makes it somewhat more interesting when you can use his stealth ability to silently kill enemies but it also gets repetitive.There's some sort of RPG mechanics too, in that you can upgrade your armor and skills when leveling up but that doesn't add very much to the game itself.Combat system is very unique, as you assign commands to your characters and watch them fight, but it's not so bad once you get used to it, so I'm not really complaining here even if fighting gets less interesting than a traditional system (in my opinion).I'm not sure I'll continue playing, I'm trying to but every time I start the game, I'm playing like 20 minutes and I just want to quit.

												In this particular case there is very little required to be reminded of another, similar game published by Focus Home Interactive while playing Of Orcs and Men. It bears both highs and lows of Game of Thrones RPG, but I would say it it adds some of its own to the mix with highly subjective results.First thing first – this probably won't be everyone's cup of tea based purely on shoddy craftsmanship, which is quite obviously the result of a limited budget and lack of polish in practically every department of the game. That's not to say everything can be attributed to higher force, though. Game's level design is very linear on purpose and takes a good long while before it breaks the monotony of uninspired grimy streets, not to mention stealth which I'll touch upon later, simply doesn't have even half-decent enemy AI to counter it so your would-be victims simply stroll past their comrades' corpses without batting an eyelid as you stalk about in binary ON/OFF stealth biding your time. This leads me to....Reasons why you may love and/or hate Of Orcs and Men. This game speaks to me on some level I didn't even know I had a preference for. Yes, it's incredibly rough around the edges with some questionable design choices. Yes, it has some serious difficulty spikes here and there that almost lead me to take a break out of sheer frustration. But standing on top of all of that I still think it's a very good game if you work with it and can overlook relatively minor issues. Why? Because it handles the concept of ""risk vs reward"" extremely well and makes it an integral part of the game. What this translates to in practice is Arkail's rage and Styx's stealthing about, both of which are absolutely required to get anything done. To tie that into calculated risk thing I mentioned earlier: you will need Arkail's rage ability, but because it's a double-edged sword during which he may attack Styx as well as enemies and because it builds up no matter what AND takes control away from you until it's run its course leaving Arkail stunned for a while, you will need to go through fights methodically waiting to pick the perfect moment when to go nuts for maximum effect. On the hand Styx's stealth will be responsible for leveling the playing field by taking out enemies before you engage in open combat and it's just as mandatory as the above because the odds are always against you. And to top it all off you will need to learn the game's somewhat obtuse real-time with slow-motion command input combat system real fast because Of Orcs and Men does not hold back any punches.Story-wise the game manages to play with your expectations, miss some beats it really should've hit perfectly but didn't for some reason and do some things I really, really like. It becomes obvious very early on our two characters aren't really heroes and barely even qualify as anti-heroes purely in contrast because they're facing opposition which is generally even worse. Arkail's rage is not only a gameplay mechanic, but also a story element which plays a sizable role in who he is as a person and you will get some unexpected story revelations about Styx as you go along, but the world these two inhabit is truly crapsack where swearing like a drunken sailor is the norm and gets worse by the day, only for story to raise questions about whether your actions will make it any better in the end and for who. I'd say pacing is a bit weak early on and may make you think you're wasting your time because it takes couple of hours until you get a proper grip on things, both with story and gameplay, but then picks up and actually feels rushed in the last quarter or so where it could've used some more time to mull over things and put an actual challenging final boss which was a disappointment compared to some fights you’ve been through.In the end, and because I've worn my keyboard out at this point meandering over what is essentially ""Do you like getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you until you learn how to hand it back?"", I leave you with these two timeless words of wisdom: psychic ♥♥♥♥.

												I want to like this game =\The story seems awesome, but the combat isn't for me... If you love strategic rpg games *basically turn by turn* you will maybe enjoy this...I really disliked the fact that you're this huge orc, but your attacks seeminly are 100% absorbed by everyone as they don't do a lot of damage, nor do they make any type of push-back effect to the signicagantly smaller humans... which is very, very dissapointing to me. (this and the slow lackluster combat makes this game feel like you're just watching a terrible movie where the actors are standing completely still and not really hitting eachother, as opposed to ordering strategic moves to your team)Tried so many times to play this game, but the combat is just so awful for my hack and slash giant orc craving =[The combat isn't even tactical... its basically hack and slash but sloowwww turn by turn hack and slash.. its utterly terrible to me, like theres no reason it should be this way, theres a bunch of enemies and youre abilities are just hack and slash type abilities (oh beside the goblin that sits back and throws daggers sometimes).. this game BEGS for hack and slash (You're a giant orc that goes on ""rampages""), or at the very least dragon age type combat..

It's short but if you've played 'Styx: Master of Shadows' you'll see how deep it goes. Secondly, I loved the characters (especially Styx). The big contrast between Styx and Arkhail was perfect to balance the gameplay and their voices were incredible. Thirdly, the music... It was one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a long time. During the important battles it really got me in the mood of what was happening. So I really recommend this game to anyone that loves old games with a good gameplay and storyline.			"

												I finally got this game on sale after being intrigued by it several years ago, and looked forward to an interesting plot, unusual characters (I like the idea of playing through an atypical perspective), and what seemed engaging gameplay, using the strengths and compensating for the weaknesses of your two protagonists.Unfortunately, it was bad.The game is obviously dated, and hasn't aged well. The graphics aren't terrible, but they're nothing to write home about. The environments (at least in the first hour I forced myself to slog through) are completely static, and the game runs on rails without even the illusion of choice.Combat is slow and frustrating, with inexplicably lengthy animations and minimal control. You can slow combat to select actions (up to 4 in a row), and watch as your character stands there, taking hits from multiple enemies, to agonizingly raise a sword... and miss... then fall to the next barrage of attacks.The worst, though, is the writing/dialog. In other reviews, I'd read others commenting on the ridiculous amount of vulgarity, and I thought to myself that it's probably just someone too sensitive to realistic conversations between hardened characters in awful situations. I was wrong. It's written more like a 13 year old trying to sound tough. It's out of place and awkward, and it's sprinkled throughout often corny and disjointed dialog. After coming back from games like Witcher 3 and Sunless Sea (brilliantly written), I tried not to hold this game to those standards, but it's awful.			"

 Of Orcs and Men8/10Tl;Dr: Definitely buy the game if it goes on sale but only buy it at full price if you are absolutely dying for a good ARPGI had gotten this game from a friend who had bought the Killer Bundle 3 and he did not want it . He asked me if I was interested in it and upon researching the game I figured I would add the game to my library, download it, and play it at a later time. I decided to check out the game when my internet went down and was pleasantly surprised by it. Graphics 8/10The game is very cinematic graphics wise. You can see that the devs tried very hard to show you a movie story through the cutscenes. The textures are very nice in this game. The skin on the orcs look somewhat realistic and you can see the lighting bounce off it. I personally find it very nice when you can see sunlight bouncing off a character's skin in any game. The rain effects look amazing and it looks as though things are actually getting wet. However, the characters do look a bit stiff sometimes. Lastly, when the characters speak (in the cutscenes) they get a bad case of the rubberlips (notorious in Warcraft 3 where characters' lips would just bounce up and down when speaking) Audio  6/10The music is generic adventure game-like. It's something you would hear and say ""Ah, that would sound nice in an action adventure game""The voiceovers are decent. The best voice actor is the one who voices Styx the Goblin. His character brings a roguelike charm with his monologues and witty lines.The biggest issue I had with the audio was the mouth synchronization. You are able to hear when the dialogue starts and ends suddenly. Gameplay   9/10This is where the game really shines. Before playing the game I assumed that it would be a hack and slash action game. The game actually plays like an ARPG (Action Role Playing Game). Upon entering the game I masked my left key hoping that the character would swing his sword around. However upon playing the first 10 minutes of the story (which serves as the tutorial) I found myself slowly understanding how the game works. The combat system is similar to Dragon Age Origins (or almost any ARPG) in that you can use the spacebar to pause the game and plan your next few moves. Pressing the spacebar also brings up your combat hud. There you can plan up to five of your next moves. Pressing spacebar again will unpause time and your character will do the attacks in the cache.The level system is fairly simple. There are five attributes that you can put points in. Strength, Agility, Stamina, and Mind. Each attribute has different helpful upgrades. You can also upgrade/unlock new abilities.You control two character in Of Orcs and Men. Arkail and Styx. While Arkail excels at fighting and tanking damage, Styx has a more stealth/assassin fighting style. Each character has a one unique mechanic. Arkail has a rage system, where if his rage bar fills (by attacking and using special abilities) he becomes uncontrollable and will just pummel at the enemy. Styx can become invisible and will 1 hit kill his next backstab target.The hud is simple yet visually pleasing.The one problem the gameplay has is that the targetting system for attacking feels a bit clunky. Sometimes it feels like your character got confused and doesn't know who to hit. Story  6/10The story is quite simple and might seem a bit cliche. Humans have enslaved the Orcs and forces them to work as slaves and cannon fodder. However, there is a group of free Orcs that are resisting the humans and are going to take a last stand. It's up to Arkail and his shifty goblin guide to take down the king and free the Orcs. The game offers some dialogue choices but so far none of them really make any changes to the story. I love the duo dynamic that exists between Arkail and Styx. They both hate each other when they first meet but grow to respect and even rely on each other.There are some iffy parts in the script though. I've noticed that the characters love to say ""♥♥♥♥"" at inappropriate times (inappropriate as in it doesn't really need to be said in the context). Also it seems like the devs/writers/animators tried to give Arkail a signature move/trait (he punches his fists a LOT whenever a cutscene with him ends) but it just ends up feeling very awkward.I was surprised when I first saw Styx in this game because he actually stars in his own game Styx: Master of Shadows, a stealth game about... well, Styx. When Styx: MaS first came out I was very interested because many people said that it was a Stealth game done right. Upon research, I now know that it is a prequel to Of Orcs and Men. Final say  Overall, I found myself enjoying the game and would definitely have bought it had I known about it. Again, I highly recommend buying it if it ever goes on sale but wait a bit if not. The gameplay is the best part of the game and the graphics are a close second.This is my first review so please tell me how I can improve and what you liked about the review on my Steam Page. Thank you for reading and it was a fun time playing Of Orcs and Men. "

												Sometimes the dialogue has a bout of stupid, the levels are linear and on harder difficulties you have to build & play a specific way to win.But most the dialogue ISN'T stupid, the linearity works out with good environments, gameplay is functional & enjoyable, the characters are both interesting and relate-able and the buddy system they have going on is top-tier.This game really deserves more than it got.7/10, worth the play			"

												The interesting story premise piqued my interests, but I was immediately let down by the juvenile dialog writing and turn based combat system. It seemed rather dull in terms of gameplay depth and the game does a terrible job of teaching you its systems. The character modeling is nice, and most of the animations as well, but the facial animations are completely off and ruin the presentation.As a budget title it seems adequate, but it didn't turn out to be the surprisingly good game I was hoping for.

												Rather a mixed bag. On the positive side: an interesting and engaging story, some parts of the graphics are rather well done, the faces for example, good voice acting, good music and a fighting system which is often fun. In many parts of the game this is an enjoyable mix of stealth and direct action. But the game design is so peculiar, that I can only imagine that the maker of the game had only a rather short design document like this: ""Itemization (is overated anyway): not too much and let's put the best stuff in the first level, then choosing armor and weapon is done and out of the way. Level design: there is a beginning and an end and a tube between them; if this isn't interesting, the graphic designer has  f**ked up. Tactical freedom: who has time for this nonsense, if the player dies he knows he hasn't yet found the way how I think he should do this level. And people who want a choice can always choose the character they play with. Character development: It's a rpg. Have you never played a rpg? Right! There you go. But let's get creative: Let's add some really cool abilities at the end of the game and let the player decide which group of abilities he chooses, but - here is the trick - without telling him what the choice are. Cool, right? And ... but that should be enough to get you going and I have to go down to the beach. Have fun!"" So the writer, the graphic designers and even the composer did their part, while the game designer spent a wonderful time at the beach.			"

												Damn this game was good, I bought it because I noticed Styx (aka Styx: The Master of Shadows; Of Orcs And Men happens later in the timeline, the games are very different and can't really be compared) is one of the two playable protagonists in this game and I was interested by the premise of playing as an orc and goblin slaughtering vicious humans rather than the other way around. I sure was not disappointed.You can expect around 12+ hours of fun out of this game. (Do your damn sidequests you lazy slob!)The game is a highly tactical action game with some RPG elements (e.g. you get to level up and choose which attributes to put points in for some minor per-level gains in stats (I found stamina makes the biggest difference so I recommend putting some points there), and also you get to choose what equipment you want to use which will vary based on your preferred play style/tactics). The combat system is rather unique and surprisingly advanced, I didn't really master it until around the last few levels in the game, the system reminded me a lot of the combat system from Star Wars: Knights of the old republic, but the major difference was that the combat system in of orcs and men is realtime (kotor was turn based) and I enjoyed it quite a lot. The game follows the epic tale of Arkail and Styx, an army of two who set out on a suicide mission to kill the human emperor who has enslaved most of the orc population (Styx is just in it for the money, he doesn't seem to care much about other goblins, he seems to think of them as nothing more than rats). Together they have to prevail through countless insurmountable challenges, and needless to say the going gets tough.Of Orcs And Men is a difficult game (if played on medium or higher difficulty) and there are several battles in the game where you need to plan out your battles well, usually on the fly. The difficulty of the game however gets massively dampened by the ability to revive your ally once he falls (with low health) which means that in the game's toughest fights you can basically try to keep Styx alive to revive Arkail when he gets killed (basically kiting your enemies on Styx and running in circles then reviving Arkail, let him take over for a second to deal some real damage, rinse and repeat). It also makes the game a little easier that you can use Styx as the assassin he is to go ahead and mercilessly assassinate as many enemies as he can before the battle begins (sometimes he can take out an entire legion this way, sometimes he can only take out the one strongest enemy to make the fight a little easier), but it helps that this is very fun to do. The assassination system is a little too easy because unlike Styx's own game, it doesn't matter if enemies see their fallen brethren's corpses, they won't notice a dman thing.In turn however the games difficulty is slightly balanced by Arkail's inefficiency in extended combat against multiple targets. He's an angry guy and has this rage bar that fills up a little every time he gets hit and every time he hits someone else, and when the bar is full he goes berserk and just attacks the nearest targets at random, if Styx doesn't stay back then he'll get clobbered too and you won't have any control over Arkail until after his rage bar empties at which point he will have a cooldown period where he is unable to move for a few seconds (basically sitting duck) so this berserking system poses a little bit of an extra challenge (which adds to the need for planning your battles).Different opponents also have different strengths and weaknesses and to increase your effectiveness you have to use the right types of attacks on the right types of opponents (there are a few systems in place).There's a lot of fun in this game's combat.Then there is the story, I was surprised by how much I liked the story, while basic, it was also pretty good, it stuck to the point very well (even during side quests), and had just the right amount of twists and turns to make it intriguing. (It also had a few holes though I guess, but I won't go into that; don't look for holes and you won't find any, e.g. it won't bother you and you will enjoy the game more).Styx was just about the only particularly good character in the game (Arkail had some moments though), but that said none of the other characters were bad. They just filled their slots in the story exactly the way they were meant to.Now let's get into a good/bad breakdownThe Good: Very fun tactical combat system Fun (albeit a bit easy) assassination system A very decent dark fantasy themed story (More game of thrones dark than berserk dark) Character interactions between Styx and Arkail can be pretty funny (When two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s come together...) Excellent soundtrack (a few of the tracks were rather unique and others cliché but all of them fit the atmosphere perfectly) 12+ hours of gameplay (if you do your side quests) Replay value (The main focus of the game is the combat, and it's fun, it can take you a whole playthrough to master it and this can make you want to go for round 2 at a higher difficulty, or use different tactics) Many animations were very pleasing to the eye (sometimes when you press space to slow down combat for deciding what commands to issue to your guys, you can see various combat animations in mid swing many of which include jumping and spinning, it's impractical irl, but it looks cool as hell in slowmo!)The Bad: Cringeworthy injection of the swearword ""♥♥♥♥ing"" into many dialogue lines (it seemed misplaced and out of character for pretty much everyone except Styx, and you'll hear it right from the start of the ♥♥♥♥ing game! (Arkail's voice actor also makes it worse, something about how he says it..)) The game is slightly old and it shows on the graphics, they're not exactly bad, they're just not particularly good (shaders were great though). There are a few bugs and wonky controls in the game (for example, the characters are supposed to auto-attack enemies in combat if you have not issued them attack commands, but if arkail is in a defensive stance he'll just stand there like a dummy and take everyone's fist up his ♥♥♥ like he's got a fetish for it instead of fighting back) but overall there wasn't anything game breaking. Many characters share the exact same face/hair model, even important storyline characters (like this guy called Raven, I've seen his face on so many guys it's not funny) it helps that some opponents are orcs and most human opponents have some sort of helmets to at least help mask this issue, but it feels kinda sloppy.I think the devs did great with what they had here, it looks like the game had a pretty limited budget but they really pulled through, and despite the bugs they lazily left in there, it was an amazing game. Quite different from most games I've played, it's uniqueness is perhaps the biggest reason why you should give it a go. Worth the 30$ asking price? Absolutely, and not for the graphics, but for the gameplay and story (for once).			"

												It took me a little while to get used to the mechanics of the game - it is based both a realtime and turn based in it's combat. You play the Orc or the Goblin, each with special abilities and ideology. When I first played the game I was all that enthused but it grew on me and now I adore the game. Good story, witty comedy (especially from the goblin Styx). Great companion game to another game called Styx: Master Shadows. Highly recommended. It's only lacking better weapons and and is a bit too linear. Otherwise, a fun rump and has a high replayability.			"

												Of Orcs And Men is another RPG from Cyanide Studio and Spiders Studios yes the sames guys who made Mars War Log which was another great action RPG. the combat this time is more like action RPG. so you have to arrange a series of attack and stop to change the order or change the target. it is good to note the game suffer from difficulty spikes so be aware or change your tactics. it is rough around the edges but it still a great game with well a written story.

												Some games are bad on paper, but have something in them that makes you ignore the negative traits in the game. This is such a game.It has very narrow and boring level design. For an rpg, very limited and boring skillset and levelup system. Main characters look great, but all the others not so. Items and exploration are meaningless and very simple. The pattern of enemies is very limited and uninspiring. AI is horrible and you have to abuse the AI to win some battles. Still, the setting of the game is very interesting, and the main characters are really well done and you enjoy journey with them. When its over, you want to see more of them. The music is really, really good and atmospheric. The battles can be annoying at times, but in the end they are still rewarding. RPG decicions are few and don`t change a thing in the story, but they add the immersion and give a nice touch for character development. How the game focused in these 2 characters and their journey together, was well made. I did want to see a longer ending though...Even if the game has problems, it left me wanting for more, and I would buy a sequel the first day it would come.			"

												This game had a lot of potential, with an interesting plot, crisp graphics and an innovative dual character system, but I just can't get past how dissapointed I am in a few key aspects of game play; The combat mechanics system they introduce here is unlike other RPGs. For each of your two characters you assign a list of actions they will execute in order, which allows for the near simulataneous control of your orc and goblin, but robs you of the fluidity that is normally present in comparable games. I never got the sense that success or failure in combat was at all connected with my level of skill or understanding of the game. I clicked the 'attack' button and the orc attacked. I didn't feel in control of my own characters.The constant interuptions, especially in the beginning, do a lot to slow down the pace of the game and make you feel less like you a playing an RPG and more like you are watching a CGI movie. Each time you go around a corner the camera pans to show you where a group of guards is standing or draw you into dialogue with a character that you don't want to interact with.Even some of the dialogue choices you are given are largely irrelevant as option A will lead you to fight a person now, while option B will have to fighting the exact same person 90 seconds later. It is common for this genre to not include these choices. No Zelda game ever let you choose if you wanted to fight Ganon or not, and that is perfectly fine, but if we will have choices make them real choices that have different outcomes. If the developers wanted to make a precisely scripted game without minor plot variations then why let players choose their dialogue response at all?I was honestly looking forward to playing this game, but quickly became frustrated by these annoyances that detract from the emersion experience. If these traits don't sound like they would bother you then perhaps you will enjoy this game more than I did.			"

												Well, I know there may be a few I-told-you-so's from people, but I went and have played Of Orcs and Men for a few hours now and it's a *VERY BAD* game in every way imaginable except it looks okay. It's been a while since I have felt I've really wasted my money like this. I've tried to be so good with this stuff, but god dammit it's *UPSETTING* me off that I could have given that $7 to another developer and actually enjoyed a game.I honest to god really enjoyed the Game of Thrones rpg by the guys at Cyanide, so the thought of similar combat didn't bother me at all, and the premise of Orcs&Men seemed pretty interesting. I also figured since it was the same engine at least the gameplay would be cool if at times the writing went Eastern European on me.Well, the writing is stilted and thoroughly subpar, in terms of horrible, horrible non-stop expository dialog, singularly zero-dimensional characters, and completely uninteresting quest progression/design.Character development is 'deep' in the sense of there are several different options at any given time, but *I'LL BE DARNED* me if they're all pretty much leading to the same style of play. It all *I'LL BE GOSH DARNED* sucks.The combat feels really worse than GoT. I'm not sure why. It's very unresponsive and clunky. It could also be the design of the encounters that contributes, which really are utter *VERY BAD*. The level environment layout is literally on rails - a two-lane MOBA level at the best of times. It's a foockin' ginny-bandersnatch.You 'stealth' your way around to silently kill an enemy or two and then the others notice you and all run at you - at which point strategy devolves into swatting at a cloud of flies. There is 'strategy' involved I guess because I have the option of throwing daggers from a distance and my other dude fighting close-up, which sucks, or having both my dudes fight in-your-face style, which also is incredibly boring.In summary, the game's *VERY BAD*. I'm a little frustrated and feel like I wasted my money. The game is *VERY BAD*. *I'LL BE GOSH DARNED* you, Cyanide, for letting this happen (I thought they were the ones to develop this, but noooope). But mostly probably *I'LL BE GOSH DARNED* you, you horrible developers Spiders, for smearing your *VERY BAD* *IT'S NOT ME, IT'S YOU* all over this game. Go die in Somalia.			"

												As many good things that I can say about this game, I cannot recommend it. The story is interesting and points are given for showing orcs, goblins, and greenskins in general as something other than mindless beasts (although there is plenty of that, too). However, the characters are very one-dimensional (edited for clarity), and for as long as the game feels with the incredibly tedious combat, the payoff at the end isn't nearly worth the journey.Why does Arkhail do that roar all the time, every time? Is Dalmation the only breed in the Empire? Really, why is Styx the only goblin that can talk? (Unless I missed something, we can only assume, even after glimpsing into his....mind.This game does a LOT right, and I wish more companies would take risks like this, but unfortunately with risk comes the possibility of falling short, and Of Orcs and Men does indeed fall short.

												I really liked Of Orcs and Men. It has a very Dragon Age Origins feel to it and it's great that finally the orcs get a fair chance of being the main characters. The game is well balanced, the story is quite interesting and the gameplay was fun. I'm afraid many people review this game negatively because they were expecting a real time action game, but as I mentioned, it's more of a Dragon Age Origins style of combat. Graphically speaking the game is not stunning, but it looks nice and the map surroundings are interesting and do not become repetitive or boring. It's a linear game though, so don't expect anything else. However, it also rewards you for exploring and for carefully planning the roles of your fighters, Arkail and Stinx, each with their own mechanics and perks. These characters have well developed personalities and backgrounds and it's a lot of fun seeing them interact with each other. I liked that for once the humans were not the good guys, but the enemy, making us see the now classic conflict from a different perspective. I really enjoyed the game so I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of game, as long as they understand that they are not buying a real time action game. So yeah, don't be a khwarsan and smash that puny emperor! *RAAAR*			"

												Of Orcs and Men will be hit or miss for most, from my perspective there's little wrong with the game. Most complaints I've read are against the combat system, it starts out a bit rough but gets better as you progress allowing for you to adjust the two characters to suit how you want to play. In my case, I made Arkail into a tankish defensive fighter whilst building upon Styx's offensive abilities. Story-wise it makes for a good change of pace to play as the ""monsters"", and whilst dialogue can be substandard at points, Arkail and Styx do play off each other well with contrasting personalities that lead to some good moments. The final thing to mention is the soundtrack is utterly superb, partially due to the Boston Cello Quartet's fantastic performances.			"

												I'll first say this game is quite nice. The art is good, the characters too (playing an orc and a goblin in an RPG with humans as enemies is really refreshing), the story is average but the characters are interesting. However, this game has one serious flaw : frustration.First, all map are linear. More linear than Skyrim's dungeons. More linear than FFXIII's. And all optionnal quests' maps are designed the same way : a linear corridor with 3 battles. Ok, optionnal quests are, you guessed it, optionnal. But in difficulty 3 out of 4, you have to do thoses quests to level up. The battle system is really frustrating. At least in difficulty 3 out of 4 (thus, 4 too, and maybe 2). Especially for those who want a little RP and want a badass orc without hacking through the levels in a too easy difficulty. First, your orc is weak. Well, he's stronger than the average enemy, but I was shocked how quickly he can fall, even in defensive mod. For most battles, you want him in full tank/defensive mode while the little goblin does all the dps... So much epicness is lost here. It would have been better to have the goblin in full status inflicting/assassin role. But no, he will often deal most of the dps...The rage thing is probably the most frustrating for RP players like me. IF Arkain becomes enrage too early, the battle is probably lost. The only moment when the rage is handy, is when there are only one or two enemies left with little HP, and Arkain can benefit from the extra health he gains when he becomes enraged. So, basically, either the rate comes too early and you lose, either it comes too late and you lack the epicness, either it comes in a stupidly easy fight you would have won without touching your controller/keyboard anyway...  Why play an orc if you can't go full berserk more often ? Why can't they be a little more useful ?For the battles, the orc is slow. Ok, it's an orc. The muscular beast who hits hard but is slow. However, his attacks can be cancelled by the enemies a bit too easily. And by ""a bit"", I mean ""a lot"". In the early game, trying to stun an opponent fails 3 times out of 4. And the stun time is so short you'll regret trying to stun them. Other skills are so long (because the orc hits multiple times in the same skill), you lose time because he hits the ground after he killed his target... while other enemies are still hitting him in melee range.Those may seems like little details for you. If it is, well, buy the game. I think I said the main problems I encountered with this game. But for those who wanted to play a badass orc, either don't buy it or play in easy difficulty (with all the boredom it may imply).			"

												While playing this I had a feeling that I have been in this universe before. Huge wall, that separates orc lands, from the rest of the world, huge white tower/city right behind wall, humans, elves, dwarfs and mages on one side, then orcs and goblins on the other... and then I got it!This is Lord of the Rings universe! Orcs here looks like Trolls in LOTR, goblins like Tolkien's orcs, and so on and so on. Story is just told from the Orc perspective, how it was before the War of Middle Earth, where both sides did what they did, regardless for causalities, ethics and lives of other races.Basically, this game is LOTR story without Elven/Human propaganda!10/10 for story and characters!

The best laid schemes...Favorite quotes:""Yeah yeah, I get it.  'Let the Goblin do it; he's cute, but expendable!'"" -Styx the Goblin.""...you want me to calm things down?  That's not really one of my strong points."" -Arkhail, Orc berserker.Of Orcs And Men by Spiders Studio/Cyanide Studio/Focus Home Interactive is problematic & at times unimpressive, but still something I'd recommend to single player fantasy action & RPG aficionados.  The game is saved by engaging story & characters as well as the unusual combat mechanics.First of all, combat.  Of the two player characters, Arkhail is a natural tank with taunts, stuns, area of effect & heavy hitting attacks.  Styx deals big damage & has useful debuffs at both melee & ranged distance.  There are a few ""shared"" utility skills requiring both characters.  The skills eventually make combat a little tedious, even though you can bind skills to number keys.  Pause feature is nifty, giving you time to think about which opponent to eliminate next.A quick word on the RPG progression elements: You'll level up, distribute attribute points into statistics like strength, agility, etcetera.  You'll also find, buy, sell, & upgrade equipment with varying stats.  I tended towards Agility for Styx & Stamina or Defense for Arkhail.  This mostly worked well.  Bear in mind however that there will be times when you're forced to rely on one or the other alone, so try to keep them a bit more self sufficient than I did!As for strategy, I tend to travel using Styx, open combat from stealth, then switch to Arkhail and hold aggro.  Certain units are strong against either Styx or Arkhail; be sure to learn & exploit enemy weaknesses (it's not obvious).  Be mindful of patrols & time your assassinations to cull a group as much as possible before open combat.Friendly AI isn't always helpful; absent your input, the non-controlled player character will default to the basic attack or even at times delay before doing anything.  In these cases you have to switch back & forth manually giving orders to both.  Targeting is another issue: it doesn't always stick, so you have to retarget the desired enemy; particularly annoying is that your movement is locked at times due to the AI carrying out your orders, which means you can't quickly move Styx out of harm's way without pausing, clearing his action queue, and re-engaging.Stealth mechanics also leave something to be desired, and even at times feel immersion breaking although that's arguably nitpicking.  While in stealth, Styx has a maximum range of movement away from Arkhail (can't leave the big guy behind!) so be sure to park Arkhail as close as you can without being detected, especially working a large area.  Stealth doesn't require disposal of slain enemies.  Enemy AI doesn't notice bodies at all; patrols walk right by bodies you just backstabbed without pause.  They also have impossibly narrow vision range & poor hearing, allowing you to kill baddies close by their friends (especially if you upgrade Styx for stealth).On difficulty settings & boss encounters: There are Easy, Medium, Hard & Extreme.  I went with Medium, & the antiheroic duo felt very powerful on this difficulty.  On the other hand, combat difficulty soars from low to very high transitioning from Medium to Hard or Extreme.  In my opinion it simply isn't fun or rewarding above Medium.  Frustratingly, two of the late/final combat encounters are absurdly difficult until you figure out the right tactics.  Making this worse is that choosing the wrong stats & skills can & will sabotage your ability to complete those fights as well as you could; like I said before, gear & upgrade your characters carefully.What really tops that cake and renders the entire thing a bit ridiculous is the poorly placed save points.  Coupled with your inability to save manually while in combat, this means for those tough fights you'll have to either redo most of an area to reach the boss combat, sit through a mountain of unskippable cutscene & dialogue before actually getting to play, or both.  I'm fine with having to retry a fight until I've learned how to succeed, but nobody wants to sit through the same content like that only to die in a poorly tuned combat encounter.The aforementioned design & balancing issues were enough to sour the experience for me a bit, in spite of my appreciation for the unique combat mechanics & my enjoyment of the story/characterization.  I know lots of players will be better than I and get through the game on Hard or Extreme but I can't imagine bothering with it.  I was ready to be done by the time I beat the game.I was underwhelmed by other aspects of Of Orcs And Men.  Level design is a bit simple, doesn't take much advantage of vertical space besides placing ranged enemies in unreachable perches.  You can use Styx's ranged stance to eliminate them, or the Goblin Toss ability.  Pathing and physics felt jumbled in certain areas.  Visuals were okay by 2012 standards when the game released.  Audio was acceptable, but unmemorable.  Thankfully there were no discernible bugs or technical issues.  The game ran well with settings maxed @ 1920/1080p.Story & characterization were clever.  It is solidly entertaining fantasy fiction fare with colorful main characters & a unique angle, showing the plight and perspective of orcs & goblins rather than humans, elves & dwarves.  Even this had pros & cons though.  Writing for much of the dialogue & cutscenes (there is a lot of both in the game) felt at times heavy handed, cheesy or just too drawn out.  Voice acting was passably good.All said & done, the reason I'm giving this a thumbs up recommendation is the creative treatment plus the modest amount of fun the combat offers.  I'm glad I played & learned the tale of Styx & Arkhail.  I would only recommend Of Orcs And Men if you've already tapped other, better fantasy fare & are interested in a slightly different take on the genre.  I'll eventually be trying out the 2014 sequel, Styx: Master of Shadows (which is apparently the prequel in terms of story).			"

												overall i had a blast with this game, the combat felt a bit clunky at the beggining but as i always start games on the hardest mode to shorten any game to often only one playthrough it would not be a problem on the easier diffucultys i think, i found it most difficult at the start before i found a tactic that worked for me, Arkail on full defense with stun punch and agro and styx with dps, poison, armor breaking and most important of all self healing, saved me a bunch of times when Arkail got beat down and had to survive until i could revive him, it pretty much went along the same way to the end of the game.there were a few things i found anoying, unskipable cutscenes before hard encounters especialy the last boss, it limited your ability to save at some points where it would have made some parrs less tidius, (even an auto save before the final boss would help alot, now you have too survive 2 waves of enemies that takes maybe 15 minutes, then a cutscene you have to watch and then the boss, He is more of a race to beat rather than the more tactical fights of the rest of the game, had to do him 6 times before he died and it felt a lot like luck at that point)but with a few exceptions i had a really enjoyable time and it felt like time well spent :)			"

												After really hoping this game would work I cannot giving it a recommendation.1. combat is extremely repetitive and boring. Pretty much since group 1 until last group you do almost literally the same thing.2. story is interresting, but spread out so thin, however I liked the whole lore spinoff of this fantasy world.3. gameplay design is borderline insane. 99% of game counts with 2 character combo, with Arkhail as tanky dude, and Styx as killing glasscanon. But several times, especially in the end, the game splits and allows only one. I literally couldn't finish the sections and move on, even on normal difficulty. Who told the devs it's a good idea should be fired from further level design. My orc doesn't do any damage and my goblin doesn't survive more than 4 hits. It is ridiculous.4. pacing of the game is completely off, it appears like a huge game, first chapter takes hours, plethora of them, but chapter 3 and 4 together takes barely an hour, it's off putting and seemed rushed.

												'Of Orcs And Men' is a nice game. It is kind of relaxing because first of all the game tells a story. You can influence the story by your choices and there are many choices to make. Some players don't like the game because you do not fight directly. You can only give orders to Arkai and Styx so the fighting is indirect but you constantly have to change commands during a fight in order to win.Graphics are not the best but OK.The music has its ups and downs. Dialogues are very good and convincing, at least in German. I recommend the game if you like fantasy and especially if you liked the 'Game of Thrones' game from the same developer. Although 'Game of Thrones' was better in terms of story.			"

												I finished this a while back so this isn't as fresh in my memory as it should. Also I have to be honest here, cyanide games are a guilty pleasure of mine. I always think there are some good ideas floating in their games but they don't manage to make the best out of all those ideas. That being said on to the main event.Gameplay:You play as 2 characters here and you can switch between them at any time once you get the second one. The first is the orc, Arkhail, and the second is the goblin, Styx.Each of them has 3 skill trees in which you can add points to get new abilities or improve an ability in 1 of 2 different ways that adds an effect like stun or lifesteal to that ability . Arkhail has a berserker and a tank tree and the 3rd has some actions that include Styx like throwing him towards enemies and later on when you choose a specialization class(story event) you get some more skills here. Styx has an assassin tree and ranged dagger throwing tree and the 3rd again has combo actions such as throwing a heal potion to Arkhail. These skill trees/wheels also count as stances that give different bonuses.Speaking of potions there are none :P You have to keep your HP up by using skills, items with lifesteal and good planning before going into the fight.Both characters can equip gear that drops or is found in chests and is specific for each character. While there isn't a whole lot of gear each new item you find will be different and sometimes they will be sidegrades instead of upgrades so they can be useful to the build you are using for them.The fights can get rather challenging at times but all of them can be overcome with some good planning. The main thing to take into account is that Arkhail has a rage meter that can build up pretty fast and sends him into berserker mode where he is faster and stronger but you cannot control his actions and he sometimes takes pauses just to roar at the enemies in which time he gets pummeled. It's up to you if you want to go the berserker route and try to survive fights counting on his rage or go the tank way where you can control his rage and diminish with certain skills. Personally I went berserker for Arkhail and assassin for styx with a few skills from the other trees just enough to cover all my bases and it was fine though there were some fights that I had to restart quite a few times. It is by no means an easy game.Graphics:From a distance they graphics look OK but when the camera zooms in for conversations the textures are really bad and blurry. A high res texture pack would to wonders for the game but I doubt we'll ever see anything like that. There is variety in the locations you go as far as design but the overall color palette is pretty bland with a lot of browns and greys.Sound:I'm not really good at this part. Thesound seems ok to me but maybe someone with a better ear will tell you differently. The music is good and the volumes are well implemented (as opposed to viking battle of asgard). My only issue here is that half the voice actors are bad. Arkhail and Styx are ok though and it's their banter that you will be hearing for most of the game anyway.Story:At the beginning the human empire is waging a massive war against all greenskins and is winning. The chief of the clan tasks Arkhail with killing the emperor as to finish the war. Arkhail needs help getting to the emperor so a guide is hired and this is where Styx comes in. From there the story has all sorts of twists and turn, some that you will expect and others that you won't. I really enjoyed the story but what I enjoyed more was Styx. He's just one of those characters that you either love or hate and if you love him you can't get enough of him.Bottom line:While there could be improvements done to all sorts of things it was an enjoyable RPG that has replay value at least for the way you can customize the play style of the 2 characters. Also take note that a lot of F-bombs are dropped, and I mean a whole lot (just in case you wanna give this to your kids to play and you're worried about that sort of thing).			"

												It's a pretty game, but it got boring real quick.  I wasn't thrilled as to how they did the combat system and the game was very linear as to where your objective was located.  The only RPG aspect that I found was the charcter leveling.  If the game was more of an open world where you could roam and explore along with your main quest, and the combat was a possble button masher as to where the combat was fast and furious and not turn based....... Well then I think we would be on to something.......			"

Very cool, entertaining story, even if very linear has quite a few interesting choices to make on the way. Characters are having a lot of skills to learn, quite a few weapons as well to choose from. Sometimes game was very hard - I intended to finish it on hard mode, but after being frustrated in some battles I just set for normal. Very cool game, very cool world and most definitely very good characters. Pick it up, you will not regret it.			"

												The graphics/models/textures all looked pretty good. Not amazing but it’s 4 years old now. The setting/story is interesting. It puts you in the shoes of what is often thought of as the evil mindless villains. You get to see that they have their own motivations and are only mad because of the racism, slavery and cruelty they have suffered at the hands of man. This game is very story driven and one of the things I didn’t like about it is that you play for a couple minutes and then interrupted by a cut-scene sort of thing with dialogue and whatnot. Occasionally you have a little bit of choice on what you want to say, but rarely. Matt asked me at one point how I was liking it as I was about 25 minutes in and I said I had hardly played any yet because it’s all cut-scene. That doesn’t always bother me if it’s the right type of game, but I thought this was more action oriented. Oh well.Being a story driven game it should be really well written, and this one, I would say is okay. Not great. It has some jokes, some of which are REALLY crude! But at the same time it’s littered with modern language, particularly swearing, that just seems so jarring to me. I don’t need middle English thee and thou but it sure doesn’t feel like fantasy talk to me, when the language would fit today. So that is a bit of an annoyance. And it is constant, so, if you hate that then I’d avoid this game. Otherwise, the story as a whole is pretty decent, I think. You are on a quest to kill the “evil” [in your mind] emperor. You hire styx the goblin as a guide. Greenskins in general are persecuted, sometimes without reason.  But you still deal with humans plenty. Sometimes to do jobs, sometimes to get help, sometimes they are on your side from the start. You learn stories of other orcs and whatnot. I think styx is the only sentient goblin though. Voice acting is ok. Sometimes it’s pretty good, sometimes it can be bad. I think it kind of depends on the writing. Apparently this was made from a French studio, so some of it might be translation issues.The combat is where it really gets…iffy. Instead of, more or less, a hack and slash, you have a hack and slash via commands. When you enter combat, you hit space bar to go into super slow-mo, select a target and assign 4 actions to move through. The Orc is like a tank, kinda, except not a very good one. He can have an offensive stance or a defensive stance, though I haven’t really figured out if there is a difference. Then each stance has different things, like punch to stun, fast basic attack, powerful attack, round swinging attack that hits more than one enemy, etc. Enemies can parry and defend, but it just never seems to work all that well in general. Styx has melee attacks and ranged attacks. I usually stick to ranged if I can, but he usually gets surrounded anyway, and he’s pretty weak. With both guys I try go with a combo of stun and then smash, but it’s never totally clear what does what exactly. Combat is definitely the weakest part of this game. It’s interesting, it just doesn’t seem to be handled really well. Styx can also hide and do silent takedowns from behind, which is useful until you are spotted. So, TL:DR – decent game with some issues. Recommended in general, but it’s not for every one. "

												Of Orcs and Men is an interesting if rather flawed action RPG. The premise is certainly fairly unique, as instead of your usual heroes you control the berserker orc Arkail and the stealthy goblin Styx.The two protagonists are probably the best part of the game. Especially Styx is a great character with some great dialogue. The story itself is rather dark as befits such unusual ""heroes"".During combat you can slow time to issue commands which are then executed in real-time. The AI only uses the basic attacks so most of the time you have to control both characters manually. This works reasonably well on a gamepad, even if the controls can be little bit clunky at times. Unfortunately, the mouse and keyboard controls are pretty terrible and best avoided.Uninspired level design is another low point of the game. There are a few sidequests along the way, but the maps themselves are extremely linear and rather boring for the most part.Despite these flaws I'd recommend Of Orcs and Men to any action RPG fans looking for something little bit different. Just make sure you are playing with a gamepad.The good:- Great main characters, especially Styx- Interesting and fittingly dark story- Nice soundtrackThe bad:- Clunky controls, especially with mouse and keyboard- Extremely linear levels- Stealth mechanics are way too simple- Arkail's rage mechanic can be annoying at times- Item system is pretty boringThe ugly:- Some poor animations			"

												If you've played their previous games you know what to expect. However if you're new the series and want to play with a controller I'd say it just feels better on the keyboard. The graphics are decent but what pulled me in is the  storyline. It's not your typical storyline and to me the way the main characters talk about the Earth Mother and a few mentions of calling them pale skins reminds me of the Native American/European incursions. Combat feels a lot like the original Dragon Age but not even really that sometimes your characters just go full retard and do some of the crazy stuff.

												First and most , it may say it`s ""action""  , but it`s kinda not , well at least in traditional way ... It`s like final fantasy without turns but you still  have to set actions for your characters .Dialogs could be more fluent and smooth , story has its twists and turns but who cares really.Recommend playing on hard difficulty. All in all you should watch some gameplay before buying .			"

												I personally found this game to be enjoyable.  The dialog and story were strong, if anything the strongest part of the game.  There were several nice twists in the story and overall enjoyed.  Dialog between the two main characters was the highlight as there are lots of great linesAt times it was tough, but not bad impossibly so.  At i did encounter a bug during one mission, but outside of that, enjoyed the game.  There is about 15 hours of game play for a single play through.			"

												Would buy when on sale.I played this because I had played Styx already, heard good things about this. It has a cool story and world, but the gameplay is fairly simple, there is no real concept of exploration or navigation as you are only able to walk/run. Combat is decent and gets better the longer the game goes on, just needs something else to add some variety to the game.			"

												I've had a blast playing through this game, and it's so extremely rare these days for any game to hold my attention for more than an hour. The story was pretty decent, dialogue was fantastic, and I was really attached to both of the main protagonists, since they were very likeable and relatable, despite being of otherworldly descent. Just be warned, there is quite a bit of swearing in the dialogue, but I thought the way it was done was creative. The whole narrative in this game is top notch.The combat system was fun and strategic, and the battles in general are quite challenging. Since this combat system is quite different to most RPGs, I'd personally suggest to play on Easy mode on the first playthrough, so to get acquainted with it.The game is quite linear. Most of its levels do tend to be a straight line, which will not appeal to players who like exploration, but I personally didn't mind the linear gameplay, because I enjoyed the story and the gameplay. In addition, you get a lot of sidequests in between. I was particularly impressed with a part of the game where you get to put together a squad and a plan of attack, and each little sidequest in that section actually counted towards it, which made them worth doing.Also worthy of note is the music. It was lovely to listen to and fit the scenes where it played perfectly.Overall I loved the game and I think it's very underappreciated. Would definitely recommend it and hope to see more games like this one from the devs behind it.			"

												I liked this game,The controls were hard too get used to at first as they were very different from what I expected. The combat sort of plays out like Real Time Turn Based combat with an option to slow time to issue commands. Once you get the hang of issuing commands to both Ark and Styx the game is really enjoyable, The story started out a little shallow but got much deeper than I expected later on - setting further character detail for Styx and future games. I would recommend giving this game a shot.  "

												If you've played their previous games you know what to expect. However if you're new the series and want to play with a controller I'd say it just feels better on the keyboard. The graphics are decent but what pulled me in is the  storyline. It's not your typical storyline and to me the way the main characters talk about the Earth Mother and a few mentions of calling them pale skins reminds me of the Native American/European incursions. Combat feels a lot like the original Dragon Age but not even really that sometimes your characters just go full retard and do some of the crazy stuff. I'd definately rate anyone to play this great game all around if you can catch it on sale even better.			"

												The story was interesting, but that is all I felt it had.  It had poor graphics, bad pathing, The ending provided no closure, and while the game controls were simplistic, because of the mix of graphics and pathing, there were times I died to archers in walls that I couldn't hit, and invisible enemies who blurred to the fight when they noticed me sneaking.  I played through the whole thing to se the story, but I didn't like the playthrough, and as stated the ending was kindof a letdown.			"

												Of Orcs and Men is without a doubt the worst RPG game I ever played (and finished). It has serious issues. The pacing of the the storyline, the overall cut short game length, the corridor level design, the lack of enemy variety (there are only 5 types of character models in the whole game), shallow strategy, obstructive unadjustable camera, overly long cutscenes and the worst controlled in game target acquisition i have ever experienced. Sometimes my characters just deliberately ignored the appointed enemy and attacked what they felt like.I dont even know why i continued to play this game. The combat handling is unlike anything i have ever played before. This game does not know weather if it is a real time strategy game or a turn based RPG. The tutorial sequence is very short and taught me next to nothing at all. You get told pretty much nothing and have to inch yourself forward by trial and error. In fact the first 2 hours in this game were so bad i wanted to drop this game right on the floor.The character management is not very noteworthy. You have few items slots that can be filled with pretty much few identical items. If you ever go for a defensive stance you are pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed. You can never respecc your Status or Skill Tree Points. If you made a poor decision once, your are stuck with it until the end of the game. The fact that some of the enemy encounters are just outrageous and you need to kite them around obstacles just to not ♥♥♥♥ing die in the blink of an eye is just ridiculous. I'm looking at you, Dog Trainer. What the ♥♥♥♥ was Cyanide even thinking.I give this game credit. Cyanide made a bold move daring to create their own dark fantasy themed franchise in this overly bloated market. As i was able to experience in the later Installment of Styx: Master of Shadows the team has a vision. I would compare it the closest to Warhammer. Dont get me wrong, i am very glad they do something independent and different and as much as i wish i could like the game just for that, i can simply not.The graphic design of this game is acceptable to impressive. The main characters and the scenery stand out. They are nice examples of how to properly do greenskin characters. The sound design is acceptable. Fighting sounds and scenery music are good, though with 5 tracks a little short. Some of the characters have poor voice actors, while others have excellent ones. Styx ones is Excellent.This game back in the day when it was released was overhyped. I don't know where the problem was, that the team was too much occupied with the foundation build of a new engine and a new fantasy brand, but it really hurt the overall game. It did not age well. Its just too short and the levels string badly together. The first and second chapter are so long that you will spend approximately 75% of your playtime there. The 3 last sections are so short that i was confused to the point where I wondered if I have accidently skipped some missions. It doesnt help either that they cut out crucial parts of the story with drawn cut scenes where you could be there out in the field making the way with actual gameplay.It really is a regrettable waste of effort. If this game would have gotten a slightly bigger development team and about 6-12 months additional time, this may would have turned out to be an excellent game. Maybe even game of the year material 2013. But as it stands, Of Orcs and Goblins is a game only a RPG fan or a Ork enthusiast with a strong stomach can digest. I give it a 4 our of 10. Still , i hope Cyanide will just do the same as they Did with the stealth game in this series and deliver a new title that will surpass this one. The few times when the game was not teabagging me i was enjoying it. Remembered me of Metal Gear Rising a little. It has long elaborate cutscenes, which sadly can annoy or stress you at times. Some scenes were implemented poorly right in front of a difficult encounter and end up unskippable.The current asking price of 30 euros is a little high. I recommend you wait for a sale and get it when it is under 10. Playing warning is adviced. Play on own risk.			"

												Nice game, great story, good dialogs, but I have to say I finish the game with a feeling that this game had potential that wasn't fully used.  As for bad stuff, music was mediocre, trading system is almost non-existent (maybe it'd be better if it were no trading here...) and fighting system, although very nice in concent, feels as if it is little unbalanced and random. In first chapter I've won several battles by going into berserk at about 10% of health and finishing last enemy at about 5% of health... But all in all, I think it's great, about 7.3 out of 10.

												I don't consider this videogame as RUBBISH. Many people think that but I disagree. Actually, I enjoyed the storyline. After all, you are an orc and not the usual human greenskins killer! The game has different defects. The animations are not really synchronized and the AI looks pretty stupid many times. Those must be improved in a sequel honestly. Graphically I expected something really better, so I was a bit disappointed when I start playing it. I don't wanna talk about the gameplay.. it's really boring and it must be redone completely. I think a ""more action"" style would be more funny than simply clicking on skills and look at your characters doing the job for ya. There's also some micro-management in that, but nothing serious. As I said before, the storyline is nice and I played it just for it. Actually, there are different side quests, but, actually, I don't know if they affect the story at all. Oh,yes, one more thing: In my opinion, the ""missions"" are too short. Most of the time you'll be watching videos. They are not that bad but I'd like to play something more too. The right balance should be found. I didn't pay for a movie, but a videogame ;). This may be exaggerated but, still,  the good balance must be found. I'd recommend this game if you wanna play a nice storyline and love orcs.			"

												Warning: There is not only no way to rebind controls ingame but it appears also not in the config files.Other than that it's an extremely linear game with highly repetitive combat. The story simply ticks all the boxes needed and nothing more though it does have two frankly unnecessary twists: one silly and one bloody obvious. The combat system is, as others have said, a little 'off' though still functional. It's a shame since the developers do seem to have really tried but the game just comes off as a bit boring.On the positive side the soundtrack was good, if a little repetitive, as were the graphics (both from a prettiness point of view and in terms of art style/matching the setting). The protagonists were also fun enough both individually and particularly when interacting with each other. The Stealth made for a nice change of pace and wasn't forced even in the specific stealth sections. I did enjoy picking off people slowly to make the inevitable fight easier on the big guy. The world could be interesting to revisit as it's just unique enough to interest me but it'd need a less repetitive game (preferably one with a working combat system).You'll probably get your money's worth if you pick it up on sale but there isn't much replayability unless you really enjoyed it.It might also have made for a good coop game.

												Overall a great game. Probably one of the more enjoyable Action RPG with tactical pause in recent years for a number of reasons.Good visuals and 3rd persion with a great perspective and decent controls that works well with a keyboard and mouse. It just is very easy and clean once you understand it. Very well done story with decent voice acting.Itemization is a little simplistic yet effective. Inventory management and item upgrades are very streamlined for ease of use. Which struck me as a little odd given how challenging the game can be at times The end result is an interesting blend of streamlined yet difficult in that it requires planning and thought for how to approach fights. Stealth gameplay was very well done and incredibly effective at helping you to progress through the game.It is very linear however does not feel especially short or rushed. Limited character customizations outside of basic attributes and skill trees and there is no new game + so this not a game most will replay. I am the type of player who really likes exploring and finding all of the quests and yet doing that in this game I still could not break above 17.5 hours of gameplay. So while it is not too short it could have had a bit more content or at the very least new game+.Overall a solid 7 out of 10. Highly recommended at $15 or less.			"

												This might be my longest review yet so here's a TL;DR: Alright game that probably could've been amazing if it had more development.Of Orcs And Men is an Action-RPG type game where you get 3 sets of different moves you can use for 2 characters and you can input 4 at a time and they will initiate automatically when you choose who you want to attack. While the gameplay is somewhat unique I can't help but feel most of it is flawed in some way.Gameplay: One of the biggest problems I had with the game was that you get about 30 different skills that you can choose to unlock as you please, and also assign skill points when you level up, but a good portion of the skills seem to be near useless or have barely noticable results. Throughout most of the game you rely on the goblin, Styx, for the majority of the fights whether you're using the extremely OP stealth mode to take out as many enemies before you have to initiate a fight or having to almost ALWAYS use the ""Armor-piercing"" skill since a majority of the enemies get tons of armor that you need to break down. Area of Effect skills also seem to have a bigger priority over every other type of skill. Arkail, the orc, compared to Styx is almost completely useless in most cases if not only to be a hit-sponge distraction to ensure Styx never gets attacked. He can also build up enough rage to go into Berserker mode yet that is entirely useless and often does more harm than good. You also can't see the amount of Dodge/Deflection an enemy has until you're attacking them and you notice they constantly Dodge/Deflect your attacks. In the end the gameplay wasn't horrible but it definitely left a bit of a sour aftertaste with me.Story(probably spoilers): The story was honestly pretty good. You play from the perspective of an exiled orc who's people are being hunted down and enslaved for the glory of the human empire and you are tasked with killing the Emperor. You're accompanied by the only intelligent Goblin in the world, Styx, who helps you get over the Wall and decides to stay with you for the entire journey. Arkhail has a strong racial bias against Styx in the beginning and Styx is just looking to get paid, but eventually they become good pals after they witness the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ conditions that orc slaves must endure and even witness each other's troubling pasts. They even gain some human allies along the way showing that not everyone supports the orc's enslavement and befriend some mages too. In the end you kill the Emperor, but it was just a trap to turn the elves and dwarves against the orcs as well as make some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the new Emperor. Then you kill the Emperor again and you kill the super evil, super strong wizard leader of the Inquisition. The last boss was pretty disappointing since it was very easy compared to a lot of other tough fights and the game ends with Arkhail and Styx being happy but now everyone, except the few mages left, is waging war on the dwindling orc race. The voice acting wasn't terrible but it has some very amateur moments and could've used some work. One thing that really surprised me as well was that nearly all the orcs and goblin talked exactly like a human compared to having an odd accent or speaking in strange tones.Everything else: For a 2012 game the graphics are slightly underwhelming, but it wasn't a big enough problem to make me stop playing. Some areas randomly drop frames quite a bit but the majority of the game was stable. The AI was a bit shoddy at times as well ranging from enemies or even my partner getting stuck on other people or objects in the environment. The music was quite good at some parts, but it wasn't anything special. Why did I make such a long review for this game? It's not everyday you get a fantasy game where you play as orcs who are on the morally good side and the world is quite different from the typical Tolkien/Warhammer fantasy. Like I said in the beginning, the game had a very promising start but it seems as though there was a major lack of development that set it to be just ""alright"" even though the game was published by Focus Home Interactive who has supported a large amount of other games(some being Warhammer based). Of Orcs And Men is definitely worth at least one playthrough and at most ~$10 on sale, but don't go into it expecting anything amazing.			"

												This doesn't feel very polished and the gameplay isn't satisfying enough. The movement and combat system is awful and comes with a great deal of bugs. The animations aren't very good and some of them are used repeatedly in the same cutscene making it look oddly unnatural, as if cutscenes weren't bad enough already with their slow pace and silly voice acting.

												This is a really nice looking game, with an interesting story, and a unique angle. I like the characters, and the voice acting is pretty good. The concept is excellent. What a shame, then, that the mechanics are complete crapola.Did you play KOTOR and think, ""Wow, this combat is too much fun. I don't think I can handle having this much fun. If only someone could do something similar, but make it boring and terrible.""? If you did, then congrats, I've found the perfect game for you. Everyone else should stay away. This game would be better served by simple hack and slash combat, or Final Fantasy style turn based combat, or even a freaking DDR pad for me to stomp on to complete combat. Hell, it would have been better with no actual combat and just cutscenes showing combat. That's how bad the combat is - it would have been better if they had done nothing at all, because this combat is less than nothing.The other mechanics aren't exactly brilliantly done either. The camera zooms in on an orc's massive back, and you can't zoom it out, so his shoulders take up about half of your screen width. The parts of the scenery I could see past his massive back looked nice, though.This was a major disappointment. So much potential thrown directly into the trash.			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONSPROS:GRAPHICS: Gorgeous. It is the right balance, everything goes together and nothing really ""sticks out."" It's dark and secretive befitting the setting.STORY: Interestingly attractive. At first, because we are all human, we think we get to play the anti-hero; but then, we realize we are actually playing the role of legitamate heroes, attempting to kill the man enslaving your people (though killing inocents still make you evil lol).CONS:LANGUAGE: Quite honestly the languae is immediatly offputting and breaks immersion. Having served in the military I am mainly desensitized to foul language and I understand and agree in some games colorful dialouge can inhance the tension or emotion of the scene. But this is basically a twelve year old trying to sound edgy by dropping the F-bomb every other sentence. It doesn't even flow with the characters themselves. It even happens in casual conversations between characters who seem to be friends. It's as if the voice actors who were hire are so stuck on their automatic swearing they couldn't turn it off just to make a game. Where are the antequated euphamisms, or the fantasy twinge on standard words (Frak anyone?), or even just making it more appropriate to the story? When he refered to Styx as vermin in the Orcish tounge that was great, but this school yard ""look at me I give the game a mature rating"" edgespeak is just a joke. It isn't offensive, it is annoying.MECHANICS: As mentioned in several reviews the mechanics are a bit ""meh."" The near time-stop action que is a great idea, but you feel like your character is always 3 actions behind everyone else. Not to mention there is no command for movement when in this menu.6/10 Get it on sale. "

												You tell your characters who to target, and 4 attacks to do, then watch them go. If you interupt them, you lose that attack and can actually fight with the character to try to make them run out of combat, cause the character wants to stay in combat.It seems fun. But as the butcher I want to pound everything, and as the goblin I want to sneak and do stealth kills. But mixing them both together is too weird for me. Once in the fight, the goblin seems useless, compared to the strength of the orc. Before the fight, sneaking for that one hit kill seems enjoyable.Actually there were only two things wrong with this game. The swearing is out of place. Its like the characters didnt really want to swear, but the script said they had to. Which comes off really aweful. In real life when someone is gonna drop the f bomb, they are either mad or frustrated. In this game, its like they are trying to describe the color blue. It just doesnt fit. ""That battle is blue!"" hm... ""That battle is blue man!"" naw... ""That blue battle is blue man..."" ok... I'll just have to play again and get the exact phrases, so I can make fun of them properly.Gaining xp through fights is what it seemed I wanted, which brings me to...The second thing wrong was that I chose to take ""the hard way"", and started a fight with an orc traitor, which started a war that I couldn't handle. I was fine having the orc fight a 4 human team, but when I tried to involve the goblin... he took off running past the soldiers I was fighting, down an alley, and into a whole nother area, where he attacked a whole new squad of soldiers. This agroed too many soldiers on my team, which killed them both fast. You can't get away.On reload I noticed I could not start previous to where I chose the hard way... in fact, it auto-saved right after I made that poor choice. So I tried again, and the misfit team just cant handle a single squad of soldiers for some reason. So I have to start completely over... next time I will save more often.In retrospect, maybe this game would be better if thought of as an incredibly interactive movie. Next time I play, I will keep that in mind.			"

												Only just gets the thumbs up.  Looks like yet another action-RPG mass-produced from a basic stencil, just with the graphic set adjusted and a few changes made to menus and such like (here the production company uses the in-house Silk engine instead of UnrealEngine3, but from appearances both are very similar).  There are a lot of them about and almost none has anything to lift it above the others.  This one just pips the entry-level competition to the post by virtue of the character Styx, a slightly cynical wise guy who has seen it all.  He has his own game, Styx Master of Shadows, which is really quite good, possibly better than this one because it draws you in, and this one doesn't have a lot going for it in that department.  The storyline appears to be pretty basic.  It relies a lot on keeping you wondering if it's going to get any better.  I'll add another comment if that does in fact prove to be the case.  But don't wait up, so far it's been a dreary string of learning-curve chores and irrelevent mini-tasks instead of a Hero's Quest.			"

The biggest problem is with the game itself seems to be the battle system and battle's themselves. There are several points in which if you didnt pick the correct skill's there is almost no way to beat certain battles or bosses. Since the game itself does not offer the ability to farm experience this leaves boss battles as overly complicated even at the lowest difficulty.

												Rating 7/10Overview: Third Person Tactical RPGThe Good:+ Artistically and technically I thought the graphics were good. Every chapter has a unique atmosphere so the setting never gets repetitive. + I like playing as an orc and a goblin, it provides a unique twist to an otherwise standard formula seen in so many other fantasy RPGs. Both characters are well written and excellently voice. The relationship between the two is what holds the entire game together. + Each character has two main skill trees to choose from to fit your play style. Although it becomes pretty apparent that certain skill trees/skills are more powerful and practical than others. The Average:The story is decent but never really evolves into anything. The entire premise is explained in the first hour of the game and never deviates. Other than the main characters, no other character is given a lot of dialogue so it becomes hard to care about the villains or side characters.  The first two chapters take a while to complete, both of these chapters have side quests. The other remaining chapters are much shorter making the game have a very uneven pace. Un-skippable cut scenes. Normally I would consider this very bad, however this game has very little cut scenes and are not very long. The Bad:The levels are REALLY linear with the occasional off beaten path that usually leads to a chest. Thus, every level plays out almost exactly the same. Run through a corridor beat down some enemies, rinse and repeat until the end. The combat is identical to that of Knights of the Old Republic. I hated it back then and I hate it now. You give a series of commands and sit back and watch as the character executes them, keep doing this until all the enemies are dead. The combat is not engaging, gets very repetitive and once you have your favorite skills unlocked gets even more boring.  Conclusion:Your enjoyment of the game will be largely dependent on how much you enjoy the main characters. It's a decent game given the budget the developers had to work with.   "

												Let me start by saying this game is awful. Please, save your money and don't buy it.●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬● ×°×★Summary Review★×°×Overall Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ [1/5]Story: ★☆☆☆☆Gameplay: ★☆☆☆☆Sound: ★☆☆☆☆●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●I've tried and tried to give this game a chance, but after 3 hours all I can conclude is that this is a prime example of a great idea gone wrong. Thanks to misguided game-tags this is being sold to players as an ""Action, RPG, Story Rich"" title. I'll tell you right now it is none of these things.First of all, the combat is clunky, even fans of this terrible game will tell you that's true. The combat is slow and strategy based, NOT an action game. Action games are free-flowing with non-stop ""action"" like Space Marine, Tomb Raider 2013, and Dragonball Xenoverse. Those are action games, this is not.And regarding the RPG elements, it's very easy to completely screw yourself if you don't spend your skill points in the right way. If that happens, you'll find yourself at the end of the game unable to finish, forcing you to start all over again, because there's no way to undo your skill points. This completely defeats the purpose of customization, which is the core element of an RPG.Secondly, the dialog feels like it was writen by a 13 year old trying to sound cool by swearing all the time. Honestly, there's no need for that much cursing. I'm by no means offended by it, it just doesn't feel appropriate to what's going on in the story. And the rest of the dialog is just, well, awful. Nothing about it is immersive.Story Rich? Really? Who tagged this game with that? Because it's not. The story is nothing more than your basic ""Orcs VS Humans"" genre. The original Warcraft had a better story to it than this. Either the developers didn't have a big enough budget to afford decent writers or they just didn't care. However, the end result is the same. A lack-luster experience that left me feeling cheated out of my money. There's no way in hell this game is worth $30. Maybe $9. Maybe. But it would still be awful.			"

												Sad to say but I have to put a negative review on this game which is a shame really because the story is VERY very good. The issue is however that the game doesn't scale very well in difficulty. It scales about as well as if you were playing a JRPG and didn't grind nor buy any new equipment, despite me doing that in this game. I scowered for secrets and instead of making it seems like ""You found a really awesome peice of a equipment, enemies can't touch you"" or ""You found a awesome sword that has the ability to stun"" all it is, is a increase in damage which sounds nice and the upgrades you can get make some items 10x more effective, but the game seems to scale up to match this.So much so that the part I was stuck on, the Orc had no armour or weapons (besides a giant stick)  but the goblin had the equipment, so I end up dying as the enemies are fighting me in the same quality as if I was fully decked out in all the best gear I worked hard with side missions to get and even then it only made battle difficulty scaled down to just above average.Most of these issues come down to the combat system. Fact is, you don't pause in combat but merely slow it down and as both your characters are mellee types (if we were to lable them classes, the Orc is a Barbarian and the Goblin is a Rogue) you have no ability to heal yourself. There is a potion ability the barbarian gets, but all that does is increase health regeneration which isn't the same thing.Steal elements are a joke at times. Sometimes I'm able to kill one guard next to another one and other times not. When dogs get introduced one of the tips is (don't try to assassinate the dogs. They can also smell you from a mile away so be careful) yet I've killed guards that were standing right behind the dogs and they didn't notice. Even though you turn transparaent when in stealth mode, moving in front of someone's vision will get you spotted.It seems like there are many abilities and choices for an ability, which is locked in, unfortunatly it seems the game is designed for a very specific ability choices and bonuses and to level your characters up in such a specific way that one mis-placed point and you will mess up your character. the creators were also responsible for that terrible Game of Thrones RPG which had an even worse combat system to it.That only good thing about it is the story and the twist on it being your heroes are the creatures usually considered monsters and evil, but here they are being invaded and enslaved by the human Empire and their plan is to kill the Emporor in hopes of destroying or atleast destabalising the empire and there is a religous side to it involving religious fanatics that have powers and spells.I'd recommend you just watch the cut-scenes online or someone's let's play because the game itself is generally not very user-friendly and very unfriendly to first-timers on the game too.

												Nothing special in any way. It didn't actually screw anything up, make mistakes here or there, or fail at any particular implementation of design or mechanics. However, it feels as if the developers didn't actually try to innovate or keep the players interested throughout the duration of the campaign. I purchased it because of a nagging feeling telling me to buy it that persisted for a while. I ended the game with the same attitude I had after the first 2 hours of play... ""meh.""

An astounding soundtrack and two well crafted main characters aren't enough to make Of Orcs and Men worth recommending.For a game released in Oct. 2012 this game feels like it could have come out nearly a decade earlier (aside from its graphics). This is a painfully linear game. The vast majority of it is spent running through brown and gray winding corridors with evenly spaced groups of enemies to encounter. What choices you are able to make, both in moving about the world and within the story, ultimately don't have much real impact. The voice acting for the two main characters, Arkail and Styx, is high quality but the remaining cast ranges from bad to atrocious.The major selling point for this game, playing from the greenskins' perspective, is implemented with mixed success. The character arcs of Arkail and Styx are both enjoyable. Their personality's balance each other out with Arkail being the brawn and honor type and Styx being the brainy and cautious one. Unfortunately the game follows a lot of stereotypes in terms of orc behavior and in a storyline centering around slaves revolting against power hungry evil rulers. Change the orcs into humans from a warrior tribe led by shamans and very little would change. That makes the story feel more human relatable but also cheapens the greenskins' perspective feature, making it seem like more of a surface change or gimmick.A lot of reviewers have commented negatively on the excessive use of foul language and I'm inclined to agree. It's not that I am offended by the words but that it feels forced, like a misguided attempt to make the game more dark and gritty. The script is otherwise decent with Styx's dialogue being the best it has to offer ranging down to some of its one dimensional villains being its worst.I enjoyed the combat during the middle hours of the game but not in the remaining hours. At the start your options are limited before you unlock more attacks and there is a bit of an awkward learning curve. Later on, the repetition got to me as the same strategy that worked early in the game worked all the way through, making most fights feel the same. Styx's ability to stealth assassinate enemies before you are spotted was a feature that I eventually stopped bothering with. I found it wasn't necessary to win most fights, slowed things down and wasn't particularly fun.Of Orcs and Men's biggest success in my opinion is its soundtrack. It stands out with a unique style that features a lot of cello and drums. As soundtracks often go, not every track is interesting but on the whole I found it catching my ear numerous times throughout the game.There are situations where I would recommend Of Orcs And Men but overall I didn't find this game to be good enough to recommend to most people. For example, diehard action RPG fans who have already exhausted the higher rated games in the genre might find something worth playing here.			"

												Honestly? The game just doesn't work well. Combat and gameplay are aggrivating and slow. There's little to no control other than selecting actions, which sometimes works really well but not in this. The dialogue was awful, listening to your main characters talk is just painful and everything sounds incredibly forced. It wasn't even all that original, the whole thing just comes across as incredibly unsatisfying.			"

												Disappointing.  Let me start by staying, I love the concept, to play as  an orc fighting humans for once, and the developers have created a rich & detailed world with interesting lore, as well as two well-written & interesting main characters. I'll happily read novels set in this world.  And the graphics are pretty good.But everything else about this game is painfully uninspired.  Every level is a corridor, and some have long stretches with neither enemies nor points of interest.  Loot is rare and frequently boring, the skill-trees are uninteresting, and while combat has a novel design allowing you to switch between the characters & queue up actions, the result delivers neither interesting tactical challenges, or good action sequences.  Hard fights often find you leading your enemies in circles while trying to revive your other character - and this is not helped by comically bad hit detection that can see you killed by a swordstrike from 20 feet away.

												CAN SKIP----------the first thing i thought when i shaw the video is""holy ♥♥♥♥ balls batman i can be a berserking orc and kill all the weak hume's?"" then i played the game.  it was nothing like that video they show.   it was more like they tryed a turn based game then half way through they stopped. after a few hours, i found my hard-on was gone.   tear jerking story i know.  STORY------------it is about a orc by the name of arkail and a goblin named styx(and yes it is the same one from styx: master of shadows).  arkail is sent to out to kill the emperor to free his people from slavery and just being killed like dogs.  other then what the main story tells you there isnt much back story to inform you, they told you about why arkail was called ""butcher"" in just 3mins and why styx is the only smart goblin in the world' again in just a few mins.    i can try and sum up the story for you ""clears throat""  roid rageing orc and smart ♥♥♥ gablin set out too kill emperor. hit a few road blocks, then orc just solves them with force or goblin gets back stabbed trying to solve them his way.  they fail' does a 180 back just to go the opposite way and gets back stabbed.  now that i said that it reminds me of the redundancy of narutos storys.COMBAT----------it is not vary smooth. you have to either hot key your moves or use what is called the tactical wheel to use any moves.  it is rather boring once you get a good set of moves you use, over and over and over again.  the steath part isnt vary great, you just move into the area with people and kill them before they see you are arkails 8FT ♥♥♥ where you left him.  but the game can get hard i can say that much, if you set it that way.GRAPHICS-------the over all graphics arent that bad, but seeing how they never make a scene from scrats, just take when you see then make there mouths move.  arkails arms are so winde you catch him getting stuck on walls and doors in a few of the cutscene. all you seen about styx is him useing the same 4 motions for the whole game.LOOT-------there isnt vary much.  for a RPG you find the best gear in the first few levels then you are ""set"" for the rest of the game. people dont drop stuff you just magicaly get them putt in your inventory when you""find them"" you cant loot people after they die.  no, what you are looking for is a chest or a rather large bag that is glowing and setting at a dead end on the other side of the map that you need to be at.LEVELING--------you level too fast and you dont get much to sink your points into. it isnt tell damn near the end of the game do you get some new skills that are worth more then the ones you start withREVIEW-----------all in all it isnt a bad game to get when on sale.  it has little to no replay value to it. it wont scratch your itch for steath or strait up berserking with a 8FT orc.  but the story is what sells it.  good luck finding a game that lets you play as one of  most fantasy RPG worst nightmares. thats right, im looking at you lord of the rings.

												Such a f'ing good game. and this is coming from a  khwarsan. This game isn't well known, but should be. I had been following it for ages before it came out, and somehow I missed it's release last year. But this game, is an instant classic. Combat is a little odd, but once you get used to it, its awesome. The storyline starts off dry, but turns into a hilarious, dark and gritty game you'd expect with the main characters being an Orc and a Goblin. If your a fan of Dragon Age and Warhammer, well they just psychic ♥♥♥♥♥ each other and had a baby, and its this game. Styx the Master of Shadows comes out end of this month, and I'm so psych'd for it. If you see this game on sale buy it, if its not on sale, buy it anyway, its worth the 30$.

												So, for what it is I absolutely loved Of Orcs And Men. It's a pretty bare-boned RPG to be sure, with only a handful of locations and only two playable characters, but what was awesome about it, to me, was the story, and how it was presented. I loved the portrayal of orcs as a subjugated race trying to cling to their old ways of honor and dealing with the corruption of man. I loved the back and forth relationship between Arkail and Styx as they adventure together.The combat system is pretty cool, too. It goes into slow-mo while you Queue up actions, and you can scout ahead and stealth kill dudes with the goblin before charging in to mop up with the orc, letting you approach encounters how you want for the most part.Definitely worth a play through if you like story and orcs.

The combat is good,those familiar with Dragon Age and KOTOR will be stepping into familiar ground.The voice acting is good mostly but some human characters need some dire recasts or something.It was sort of strange to see orcs without tusks though, everyone looks like The Hulk.Overall good game,great if you are an orc fanboy like myself. I hope this new IP gets more followers and might someday get a sequel.			"

												Of Orcs and Men may not be a perfect game but it is a great game that tells an amazing story. I loved the characters and the quest they where on. It really was a wonderful change of pace. The RPG elements of the game where not the greatest and combat was normally a little repetative but both where still very enjoyable and reminded me of a more basic version of Dragon Age.During my first play through I felt that the developers idea of making a challenging fight was to simply ""crank it up to 11"" but after playing it once though I was able to get a better idea for what worked well and rarely ran into anything ""unfair"" during the game.The only thing that really dragged the game down was the lackluster level design. Most levels are very linear and basic. There was mention of how the goblin Styx could go places Arkail the orc could not at the start of the game but I think this was only implemented two or three times in the game and the few times I could do it I felt like it didn't make a difference. On top of that some of the character design for the supporting characters was, well, total crap. Although the main characters where very well done for the most part, the majority of the enemies where extremely generic and skins where recycled generously. These are small complaints though as the focus of this game is on Arkail and Styx and the wonky NPC's don't detract fromt he experience too much.Over all though I still highly recomend this game. I loved it. The stories of Arkail and Styx are inspiring and by themselves make the game worth every penny. I have shamelessly stolen a lot of the ideas behind the plot of this game for a Dungeons and Dragons campaing I have been running for three years now and the players love it. Now that I have beat the game twice I can't wait to give the prequal, Styx: Master of Shadows, a try.			"

												You know you chose a good game, when your ""hero's"" are a ragtag group of mythological creatures. You know you chose the RIGHT game, when said ""hero's"" swear 69% of the time. I mean, has there ever been a fantasy story where orcs and goblins curses in it? OOAM is a great game. It is really refreshing when you don't play as humans and actually try something new. I highly recommend it, although you probably have to adapt to the new combat system.			"

												I bought this game during one of the usual holiday steam sales, thinking it would be just another game burried in my library to hold my attention until I beat it. I'll be honest, at first, I wasn't too into it. The voice acting bugged me slightly in some parts and some of the animation isn't great or is recycled constantly. The weapon/gear upgrades are limited and the combat system isn't too terribly spectacular, but it gets the job done. However, I was determined to see it through, seeing as I spent my money on it. Needless to say, I was surprised to find out the more I kept playing, the more I loved this damn game! Appart from some minor nitpicking stated earlier, the graphics really are rather well done, and there are some stunning sceneries later in the game. Of course, the story line is its biggest triumph. Playing as the two Greenskins and seeing the relationship between Arkail and Styx develope is hilarious and heartwarming. Definetly a must buy and I recommend it to everyone! Dwarf, Elf, Orc, Rakash or Khwarsan! :) <3			"

												Although the game is now older but definitely has something to offer.Strong Arkail and ""witticism"" Styx. Duo on which you'll never forget.Graphically processed respectable world is straightforward and does not surprise you.Battles are turn-based and sometimes can be really hard time. Especially on Extreme difficulty.Unfortunately, I have to say that apart from the jokes for me, the game is not as attractive as it appeared in the pictures.I suggest you reconsider the purchase.

												(I did not complete the game!) Honestly I have tried to like and complete  this game.  I have tried to play this game many times, but here are some positives about the game Of Orcs and Men.  The story for this game is different in a way that make you appreciate the bruiting orc or the snarky goblin you play as.  Instead of a regular redemption story this felt like more along the line of revenge with somewhat of a redemption story which is great twist that you sometime don't see in some big AAA games. Here is somethings that I did not like about the game that is keeping me from completion.I did not like the battle system for this game.  It seemed like it was based from Knights of the Old Republic but instead of having a party of 3 or even 4 you only have 2.  You are given a warrior and a rogue in your party which for me caused a lot of issues for the many plain and difficult battles. The battles did not seem to be designed well and I felt like I was over powered most of the time.  Boss battles are not well designed and are not memorable by any means. The one good thing you could do to make a battle easier was to get stealth kills, but you had to balance not being seen while having your other companion who could not use stealth be somewhat close before engaging in another battle.  This would allow you to get some stealth kills in but it wouldn't take long before someone seen your other companion and engaged battle.  When I normally play games I try to play on the default setting which would normally be on normal but this is the first game where I felt so overpowered on normal I had to switched it to easy and I still feel like I am overpowered.  To me the loot system they had in this game was not needed and felt very shallow.I am not going to talk about the art in this game because I may not like it but others might. This is my review on the game, so I hope that this is useful. "

												Let me start with the cons:- The game has just rudimentary systems and gameplay. The stats don't matter for the most part and only few skills open up new combat strategies. Most numbers and stats are not important (+5% dodge or +10% dodge? +2 Mind or +2 Stamina? Doesn't really matter).- The level design is very linear, there is nothing to explore. Regardless of whether you are in the catacombs, the forest or the monastery, all levels are just corridors.- The quest design is similarly simplistic. There are only a few sidequests and they don't really matter. There are almost no choices and consequences. In the middle of the game there is one interesting series of choices but there is no sign later whether it changes anything. The game plays more like a linear adventure with stat-based combat than an RPG.Despite that I recommend the game. Why?- The main characters are what drew me forward. Arkail and Styx are superbly written and voiced. As you play on, their relationship develops and they both confront their past. Styx especially is wonderfully sarcastic and misanthropic and it never grows stale, even until the final cutscene.- The music is wonderful.- The environment styles are also nice (apart from the catacombs, those were boring). Especially in the later parts of the game.I found the gameplay in Bound By Flame, Mars: War Logs and Of Orcs And Men similarly repetitive. But this was the most compelling game of the three for me, mostly because of the two protagonists, whose story I wanted to see till the end.			"

												in the end it was a coin toss, literally, head said 'not recommended'. shame steam doesnt have a neutral recommendation.for me, it was a slightly enjoyable experience with a lot of frustration. mind you, not exactly my genre - i like rpgs and can enjoy action titles with some kind of character development but i was on the edge with this one the whole time.so i will enumerate my laments (he-he) but keep in mind that the game has some nice features too, but you should read about them in the 'recommended' reviews. i will not even try to seem objective, not my, heh, objective (i know, goal, aim etc).-well its more or less hack 'n slash, im not much for it, but it cant be helped, i wasnt the target audience. but for me it seemed that at least the half of the many attacks/abilities were only to fill the place. in a good game there should be purpose or at least a niche for every one. balance?-the maps were very linear, also a bane of the genre so i shouldnt criticize the game for it but i do, and even more so when i just run through half of the map for nothing, no loot, no enemies.-maybe the creators were so proud of their product that they wanted to show off the scenery but although there were some eye catching design elements the graphics were not very convincing for a 2012 game.-the voice acting was superb most of the time but there were a few clear miscasts eg raven. also if you have to wait for your mate every 2 minutes, there should have been a greater variety of clips reminding you, i was both annoyed by the fact that my buddy was too back for the games taste and also by the message telling me so.-btw, if i want to explore the (not too big) map with styx slahing throats here and there maybe i shouldnt have have to wait for ark at the door of every second room. hey, some freedom? some immersion or something?-music was nice, atmospheric but forgettable. nothing to criticize here and nothing to remember, did its job.-i dont see why almost all good items were placed in the first act. after that i picked up a few here and there but very few really more useful, i mostly did it for variety. balance?-i still cant understand why developers think that its a good idea to make those who ultimately pay their salaries watch their logos every time the game is started. its an old grievance of mine and im certain im not alone with this. remember dawn of war (the first one)? you had to watch the intros for the first time (and it was sooo cool), after that, you could skip it. if you cant achieve that, let me skip it the first time. i didnt pay to suffer, thanks.-ah, you say, why dont you just alttab from the game instead of quitting? that way you can minimize your watching them again. and again. and again. 1. sometimes after alttabbing the music stays on, so you have to mute it and then unmute it, doable of course but inconvinient; 2. once i couldnt manually save after coming back from desktop. but of course i didnt know that was the reason, i thought the game is screwing with me not letting me save (in a way it did), and that was the first time i almost uninstalled it as i had to fight through some hard battles and when i died i had to start anew from much further. alttabbing btw: they still did much better job than bethesda - they cant solve this conundrum (among others) since morrowind (2002!)...-ah, battles? you have a map where you p1ss blood to survive (and i dont mean bosses) and the next five is cakewalk. again, balance?-i felt i spent too much time watching cutscenes. dont misunderstand me, i like meself a good story but it seemed to me sometimes that i have to watch 5 minutes of cutscenes to play the same amout of time. maybe i just wanted to get over with this game to start another with better entertainment/frustration ratio, i dont know, i generally like these story elements.-you cannot skip all cutscenes. im at the endgame where i failed twice miserably and i have to watch half of the damned talking to try again, and of course no saves between battles. thanks, devs. im not sure im willing to do it more than 1 or 2 times more and however i hate to leave a game unfinished, especially so close to its ending theres a good chance that i will in this case.all in all with some polishing and playtesting, balancing the powers/items/battles this could have been a much better title.my story with of orcs and men: i followed news about it. it was released, i waited for sale, bought it on sale. waited to have some time to play it. quite liked it but was somewhat annoyed. run into the alttab-nosave problem, almost deleted it. i enjoyed somewhat more after that. searched for the styx game, addet to wishlist. got to the end, got frustrated, removed styx from my wishlist and i will try again the endgame for a few times.now, despite all the criticism above, dont be (completely) disheartened: this game have some nice features and might be much more entertaining for you than it was for me. if you love the genre and you feel you can forgive the problems above, go give it a try. i almost gave it a 'slightly recommended' but the coin thought otherwise.EDIT: i could beat zealot for the 3rd try somehow, so i have finished the game. still, this fact does not much to redeem the game as a whole, so the 'not recommended' flag stays. this means i also got to the end credits, where the playtesters were listed: all 6 of them. that is not too many and i am sorry but it showed.

												I found this to be a surprisingly good game once you get past the first couple of hours.  It put me off right at the start - The poor/average voice acting, the need to swear every other word and the combat as well (It's more or less like Knights of the Old Republic, but less fun), but once I'd levelled up a bit and got the story rolling it was surprisingly engrossing.  By using hotkeys for skills, as the game suggests (and you even get an achievement for it), combat felt much, much smoother.On the downside, the final act of the game felt rushed and the ending isn't subtle about setting up a sequel that hasn't happened yet.

												It feels like the storywriters had a really solid idea, but didn't have the budget to pull it off. There's the feel of a setting that's interesting, even if no one single element is original, the combination is. You play the last great hero of the orcs, sent on a one-way mission to avoid the final genocide of your race by assassinating the human emperor. But while you move through a non-standard fantasy story, the gameplay is the most railroaded since Railroad Tychoon 2: the Railroading. There's ONE way through each map, and usually only one valid tactic in each fight. Your sole impact on the game is the choice of skills, which don't actually change what the characters can do, just how well they do it. And by the endgame, it seems clear that most people will have identical skill trees anyway.			"

												Of Orcs And Men has all the qualities of a great book: it lures you into its story and you are constantly interested in what will happen next. Character interaction isn't forced by putting them around a campfire at night and boasting stories over roast pig. We hear little of their stories, and we learn of the main characters by how they talk to eachother and to others, and you learn more about them in a good pace across the game.Sadly, it also has flaws that comes with trying to simulate a good book in a videogame: the level designs and progress through the game are very linear, where the few stray paths are there to provide a little more gear, experience and sometimes a bit of story. The combat itself reminds me of Dragon Age 2, where you can queue up abilities in a slow-motion menu, where it is then executed in real-time. There's no shortage of abilities, but beyond the Rage and Concentration system, there isn't a very unique combat style. (In fact, on harder difficulties, certain abilities and builds are so much more effective than others, that combat itself can become repetitive).The blend of shallow RPG-elements but great story elements does make it fun to play however. If you take all the optional sidequests, routes and talk with every NPC, the game has a surprisingly large amount of content. With only three achievements dependant on multiple choice, it's possible to get every achievement in the game with two instances of reloading to a previous save.A few last special notions to some of the more memorable notions of the game: it's graphics, it's world and it's soundtrack.The graphics aren't very high-end, and with some ofthe more advanced games around, you won't be impressed. But it does a good job at imitating them, without being very demanding on your hardware.The world it plays in is different from other fantasy RPGs - that much should be clear by the title alone! It's one of the few recent RPG-releases that's more interested in painting morals gray than black-and-white.The soundtrack is from the Boston Cello Quartet, and is an absolute gem. It's also implemented into the game to play/loop certain parts of a soundtrack at certain points of combat/cutscenes; the soundtrack itself syncs with your level progression.Of Orcs And Men is a good recommendation, and it's a shame that Spiders Studio confirmed there are currently no plans for a much desired sequal. I personally found the price a bit too steep, but thankfully, Steam regulary allows sales and I managed to get Of Orcs And Men for a considerable discount.			"

												This game is very well made.  Its primary method of play is strategy of combat.  You are provided with two protagonists, an Orc and a Goblin.  Most obviously, one is a brutish tank capable of dealing extreme damage and taking punishment, and the other is stealthy assassin capable of fighting both in melee and range, and is better suited to the delicate tasks.  That said, the impressive thing is how well the two characters pair in order to provide an excellent play experience.The story behind the game is well written, and the voice acting for the characters is rather excellent.  The protagonists being an orc and a goblin is exciting, even if some of the storyline elements can be viewed as cliche.  In fact, the voice acting and writing is so well done it makes it obvious that the 'conversation' animations are limited.  That said, the limited animations feel 'right' to both the dialog and the gameplay.  Of Orcs and Men is a game that focuses on the well defined and executed gameplay, rather than the shiny baubles most companies seem to focus their efforts on in order to distract the player from poor gameplay.  The pairing of the characters, and the inner dichotomies of their skill wheels provides rich gameplay for the mostly well designed battles and encounters.  Perhaps the most frustrating of encounters are the boss battles, because your have less time and space to plan and execute battle strategy, but it's just one more layer to an interesting game and story.

												A diamond on the rough! Of Orcs and Men is nothing short of a compelling tale of a reverse good-vs-evil plot. Although not necessarily a style only seen under fantasy, high or low, storylines, OO&M tackles those elements and tackles them HARD. Be ready to have some of your pre-conceived notions of fantasy twisted in a way that not even Shrek could come up with - and with a much more serious tone. Watch out for foul language (there is a LOT) if you'd like to avoid it. If you don't mind it like me, this will just bring much more life to this already vibrant world (after all, a rough orc and a shifty goblin aren't old ladies nor are their usual repertoire). Nevertheless, there are some flaws: animation is pretty damn bad (the persistent use of the blatant same animations reminds me of KotOR of all things, in a sense that you can tell which animation is being used - for the 100th time), so is voice acting for anyone outside the main cast (although Arkail and Styx, the protagonists, sound perfectly as they should) and graphics are okay, at best - a medium-end machine or lower can play it maxed and indeed enjoy some good visuals. I also dislike how pretty much every section of the game is structured as a ""corridor"": you have optional pathways, but it really works as a road with just one blatant way to go - instead of a dungeon-crawler, this is a corridor-crawler.The fascinating story, the likeable characters (despite sometimes feeling too one-dimensional, until late chapter 2, when things begin heating up) and the intriguing, almost turn-based, and simple (if played on easy) yet complex (on hard and *gasp* the frustratingly challenging Extreme difficulties) combat kept me going despite the flaws.Really enjoyed playing the game and I'm definetly playing it again sometime in the future. As well as keeping an eye out for future games from these devs.			"

												The short version: This game, overall better than mediocre. The story was interesting; the graphics were fair; the controls were good. 'Of Orcs And Men' had a lot of potential to be a GREAT game, but some of it's bugs and shortcomings bring it down. Nevertheless, I recommend giving it a play-through.--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---I will not rehash the concept behind 'Of Orcs And Men'; there are plenty of reviews which lay out the concepts of this title. What will follow is a collection of problems I had with 'Of Orcs And Men'.Graphics: Character designs for anything that's not a goblin or orc are painfully mediocre. Humans and dogs are bland at best, and many of their animations are very stiff. Shadow quality is poor. Many of the animations, particularly in cut-scenes, can be a bit jittery.Dialogue: The early game is pretty good. Arkail and Styx were done mostly well throughout the game. Other voice actors are often bland, wooden, or outright BAD. The voice work for the one dwarf in the game is HORRIBLE, sounding as though it may have been ""read"" by a computer generated voice... it was THAT BAD!General Combat: Throughout 'OOAM' you will very often find yourself swarmed by small hordes of enemies. This is great, as it lends to the sense of awesomeness of the protagonists. Many of your combat abilities cause crowd control effects, such as stun, which are often necessary to survive some encounters. While it's understandable for some enemies to be more resistant to these effects than others, there seems to be an anti-CC-lock mechanic in place, which seems to prevent MOST enemies from being stunned more that once or twice. This would be great if it worked both ways! I found in some combats, particularly those with magic-wielding Inquisitors, that the enemy's ability to unerringly CC you can easily lead to your death if one of your characters falls, making it impossible for the conscious character to rouse the unconscious one.A.I. Combat: Arkail and Styx are a team. You can control either character, and whichever you are not controlling is directed by the A.I. when not given a list of specific commands, or when that list runs out. Additionally, if you are scouting ahead with Styx, and get detected, Arkail will not automatically run to his side to fight with him! This can be particularly tricky if there is a bit of distance between the characters. Opening up the command menu will slow time to a crawl, allowing you to issue commands, but you can only move the characters in real time, and you can't control them both at the same time. This often leads to having to run Styx back to wherever you left Arkail, who will be waiting there with a thumb up his .... Adding to the A.I. combat frustration, stuns and other such crowd control effects used against you will not only interrupt the character while trying to execute a command, it will often clear their command queue, meaning they will not resume the queue once the effect has passed. This can often be detrimental, particularly in cases where you've queued a character to perform a vital self-heal.A.I. Pathing: There are many points where one character will get stuck and not follow the lead character (especially if you're scouting with Styx.) Additionally, there are a few locations where even the character you're controlling won't respond to a given command due to a pathing problem. What's worse, this often leads to enemies (at least the melee variety) completely ignoring that character and ganging up on the other one. If the ""invisible"" character is Arkail, be prepared to watch Styx meet his doom VERY QUICKLY!Miscellaneous Issues: 1. While the story for 'Of Orcs And Men' is fairly interesting, some of the conversations can be painfully length, especially in a few of the scenarios where you have died (sometimes multiple times) and are forced to repeat a lengthy bit of dialogue. This can be even more obnoxious if the game won't allow you to skip the dialogue. 2. The armor upgrade system is extremely simple, giving every item in the game a single upgrade. What's more, the game does not give you any sort of preview as to how much this will improve an item. At early stages, when trade points are sparse, it can be quite irritating to upgrade an item only to find your currently equipped gear is still better. At later stages, when you have mages who can supposedly ""enhance"" your equipment, this could have been made significantly more interesting by adding effects to gear rather than the same enhancements you would get from any other merchant you had dealt with at earlier points. Equipment upgrading was very lackluster. 3. Saving, at later stages in the game, is virtually pointless OR inaccessible, forcing you to rely on autosaves, as you may be forced to soldier on through a series of several combats before the next save. This was particularly obnoxious at the end of the game, as a death with the boss fight would force replaying three or four consecutive combats AND a lengthy, unskippable dialogue scene. 4. Arkail's weapon after loading. It seemed that after every break (quitting the game, and loading it back up at a later time), Arkail's weapon would no longer look like what he had equipped, and would instead look like a simple stick/club. It wasn't until near the end of the game I realized this was because Arkail would somehow unequip his weapon upon reloading the game! This is a minor issue, as you simply have to re-equip his weapon, but this shouldn't even happen in the first place. I also had this happen randomly during play, usually after the occasional cut-scene. 5. At a late point in the game, both Arkail and Styx are each given the choice between two advancement paths which grant access to additional abilities. The game does not give any indication as to what the different advancement paths with grant, so players who are more interested in the abilities they will gain rather than the story reason for selecting a given path will find this lack of insight a bit irritating. 6. Styx is all about stealth, but this option becomes an increasingly less viable option the more the story advances. I found there was almost no point to stealth at the end game. Dogs cannot be assassinated, very few enemies are positioned in ways which allow for stealth kills, and those who are are often extremely weak anyway, so there is not much point to wasting time with sneaking. As a proponent of stealth-based games, I found this highly disappointing. Additionally, the few times where you are forced to play solo as Styx, you are thrust into the combat with no option for approaching with stealth. If you don't build Styx to be tough (focusing on Stamina), this can make for a ludicrously difficult combat.General Gameplay Weakness: While there are many options available to the player as they advance Styx and Arkail, the best option is to focus on Arkail's defensive abilities and Styx's ranged abilities. Optimally, focusing on Stamina for both these characters will make them extremely tough, and make the game far easier to beat. Essentially, this is the only ""right"" way to play, particularly at the higher difficulty settings.--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---All that said, the game was very engrossing. When I would play, several hours would easily pass, and I didn't want to stop until I had finished.			"

												This game is such ♥♥♥♥. I was expecting a game like Dragon Age based on all of the reviews, and the combat system is fairly similar. However, I can't get over the fact that the voice acting is SO bad and the orcs take every chance they can to spew words like ""♥♥♥♥"" ""♥♥♥♥"" and ""♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it"". They sound like that kid on the playground that learned a new curse word from his older brother and wants to say it as much as possible.The writing just seems cheap and coupled with the bad voice acting and meh narrative I say pass. I know I only have 22 minutes on record playing this game, but if you require more time than that for me to like your game when it is grating against me, I'm out.

												Well. I'll give some honourable mentions to the graphics and the idea of the storyline. War can be niether right or wrong according to who's telling the story. I love that idea.However the trailer eluded to some cinematic dialogue with glorious voices all supporting what was going to be a wonderful experience of combat. Yet I only got grunts and written dialogue. 'Okay, that's forgivable I guess'...but the more I let the characters continue in dialogue, the more I felt like I was reading teenagers speak...Then I entered a turn based combat system, again which wasn't displayed in the description nor the trailer. Now, I don't enjoy being ridden like a fool and that's how I felt when I bought the game.			"

												I would love to recommend this game.The story of this game is interesting funny and nice to listen.The graphics is nice too.Its really nice to play this game.BUTThe combat system is bulls**t. You can mostly only play it on easy or normal. For other difficulty you need to know what skill you will get and what state your character must have and you must have luck that the game mechanic don't ♥♥♥♥ your game to hard. I mean you are surrounded by enemy's and you can not activate one skill or run away. The aggro bar is in a second full and that it your dead, because the orc takes hours before attacks or do something. In addition is there a problem with the enemy focus. You tell your character which enemy to attack but your character do nothing or attack the wrong guy. The moment you accepted a request you wont be able to cancel it later in-game. The only chance you get is to delete your save-game and start from the beginning. Did you skill your character wrong than that's it. You cannot reset your skill points. You need to play it trough till the end with the wrong skills or delete your save-game and start new.The combat system is a matter of habit. For the combat system you need to select a enemy then you tell your character what to do with skills. Attack or counter an attack but you can't change it in combat. You can try it but your character mostly wont do it. You don't have an intervention in the fight you can only tell your character what the next move will be.There I mean you don't play with the mouse button to attack you attack with learned skills or defend or interact with the second character.Than is there problem with the map itself. Over and over again you will stuck on stairs, stones , boards etc.. Mostly is the second character stuck in areas where you mostly ask ""why did you stuck there??"" or ""where is the goblin/orc??"" and you can not move on because of the distant limits.Note:For an finished product this game has to much errors and that 30€  are to much. There should be an hotfix for this game. The combat system should be overworked. Just as the enemy movement for the difficulty.			"

												TL;DR, Orcs swear so much, a sailor would be offended. Speaking as not a sailor, I still don't like it.It may be a good looking RPG but the dialogue is pretty bad. The only way that the writers thought to convey that the orcs were angry was to add common swears such as ""F*ck"" and ""s*it"" into the dialogue. And for me, that really puts me off. I mean moderate curses throughtout the dialogue would have been better to deal with but in nearly every dialogue it's just said almost nonchalantly. It's not a make or break deal for the game but it does make me lose interest and any sense of immersion pretty fast.Maybe the game gets better after you stomach through the bad dialogue choice. I wouldn't know. I was captivated by the thought of the story and how it seemed like it was a different RPG -styled game. I was deterred after the dialogue made every bit of my immersion shatter like a windscreen underneath a 100 foot towering tree. But hey. If you don't mind the constant ""f*ck this"" or whatever, then by all means. It's got pretty grpahics and all that and the water running over the character models is pretty geniune. I'd rather go and find a better RPG that doesn't have ""f*ck"" used more common than another swear in some parts of Australia.			"

												Having never played the Games Of Thrones RPG before I was pleasantly surprised by Of Orcs And Men. It's a linear RPG where you control an orc and a goblin. The goblin is good for debuffing and silently killing off enemies and the orc can be used for mob control basically. There's also a tag team move where you can throw away the goblin and inflict massive damage. The camps you visit will act as a hub for your quests.That doesn't sound all that exciting, right ? It's not, really. But the combat mechanic is somewhat fresh. During combat you can pause the game and choose your actions. Yes, we've seen it before. But maybe it's because of the characters; they're exact opposites of each other and that's what makes it so fun to play.Let's see, what else... the game can be finished in approximately 12-15 hours. The graphics are amazing; the whole things runs at a solid 60FPS. The voice acting is quite alright and the music is very good.[Rating: 85/100]Recommended ! (character limits suck !)			"

												Absolutely gutted.I will start by saying that i only gave this game half an hour or so if that. I thought ""wow, an orc driven game!"" which got me going right away as i love the greenskin races. everything i'd seen including artwork, trailers and so on pointed to it being a fantastic game full of action and freedom to experience the lush, rich world that the creators so painstaikingly created. the pros: it is a beautifully animated game, well voiced and intriguing from the first minute. the two main characters are deep and interesting. it made me want from minute one to explore and play this game, (right up until the combat that is.) the musical score is amazing, that much that i bought it for my roleplaying group games. The cons: The downside of this game comes in the disappointing gameplay. it is done in the same format of SWTOR and dragon age which i find a bit annoying anyway, preferring the feeling of fully controlling the character. the switching between two characters isn't in my opinion very well done, and i found myself fighting to keep both alive instead of accomplishing team maouvers etc. the games pace in general isnt very fast, and it feels like a game in its development stage still. it is also criminally restrictive, railroading you which is even worse as the game looks beautiful but there is very little interaction.at best, a 6/10 simply for the idea and the music. the game is not good at all.

A story where, unlike a lot of fantasy games, the orcs are the opressed minority rather than bloodthirsty killers.However the game itself simply doesn't grab me. Combat feels clunky and the dialouge focuses more on crude humor and foul language.

												I've had Of Orcs And Men on my wishlist since it's release. The premise sounded very interesting and the idea of playing as an Orc for once made it even better. However, I held off on purchasing the game. I know Focus does not always release the best of games and I usually give them some time to get all the bugs and stuff under control before I purchase any of their titles. I also saw the critic scores that were just mediocre, but I don't always agree with critics. I said all that to say I have been waiting to play this game for quite a while now and was eager and convienced I would enjoy it. The story is pretty good. The dialouge options are really nice. It's great to hear your character actually say your dialouge choices instead of the silent avatar syndrome. Combat is meh. It's exactly the same as Game of Thrones. It's a mix of real-time/Turn-based combat that has you switching your attention between controlled characters. The problem I have with combat in Of Orcs And Men is the same problem I had in Game of Thrones. All encounters seem to have a slim margin of victory. You will focus on one characters attacks and after issuing 2 or 3 skills, you'll notice the other character is about to die. I don't understand how both of my characters seem to always be near death everytime I change focus. As well the skills you choose in combat aren't all that varied and I found myself sticking to a one two punch combo with my Orc and leaving the goblin as fodder since he's worthless in combat.Combat can be forgive though. I don't mind a challenge as long as the story is good. The reason I do not recommend Of Orcs And Men is FOV!!! That's right! The field of view for this game has to be about 30. Your Orc takes up 45% of the screen. If you choose to switch to the Goblin you're presented with a super zoomed in view. The graphics are great, the set pieces are nice, why they chose to make the view so damn limited and not show off their work defies logic. Game of Thrones had the same issue, but there was a work around. This game has none. It feels like you're trying to play a game while wearing your creepy uncle's coke bottle glasses. I got so dizzy that, after only 1 hour of play I had to stop. I felt like I was going to throw up. Even 30 minutes after playing the game I still feel slightly dizzy. Of Orcs And Men has to worst FOV I have ever experienced in a game.  I doubt I will ever play another Focus release again.			"

												There are many points ""for"" this game.  But here are the main reasons why I choose to thumbs down this game.  First, the field of view is truly annoying.  For a 3rd person game, one has to rely on moving the mouse too much.  Second, the clunky ""que"" system to fight.  Each character has up to 4 slots to que up an action.  Even though through the course of this game I did get used to it...it is still a really terrible way for actions to be given.  Third, you have two characters.  One is for stealth and assassination the other is a fighting ""tank"".  ALL situations are perfect for the fighter.  Not all situations are perfect for the assassin.  Why?  Seriously!  Why?  If you are going to have two characters to control give them both an equal amount of situations where their skills are perfect.  I can't even begin to relate how many times I snuck up on a group of enemies only to find out I can't assassinate anyone because of the way they were placed.  Why even give that option to the players then?  Thirdly, there isn't a lot of loot and there is ZERO gold.  Want to upgrade?  Want to get new weapons or armour?  You need ""trade points"".  You get trade points with the scant few random chests that only contain ONE item or are given a couple here and there by the game.  None of the items end up being all that great even with the ""upgrades"".  It is hard to tell the difference between one item to the next.  They all feel basically the same in the long run.  Fourth, and last (just to keep it short)...  There are a LOT of cutscenes in this game.  Most you can skip over.  The ones for the last battle YOU CANNOT SKIP!  Imagine this...  You are fighting the last battle and die.  When you begin again you realise not only do you have to fight two battles until you get to the last battle but you have to watch the cutscenes!  You CANNOT SKIP THEM!  THEY ARE ALSO LONG CUTSCENES!  That's right.  The makers of this game give a BIG ""F-You!"" to the players with a three battle and two cutscene ending where you cannot skip the cutscenes.  True, you there are segments where you can ""fastforward"" but the cutscenes still last MINUTES.  You might think, ""Minutes aren't that bad...""  But when I am able to get up, walk to my kitchen, get a drink, come back and I still have a long time to wait...  THAT is too long.  THAT is the epitomy of annoying and unneccissary.The end battle is winnable.  The unskippable end battle cutscenes WILL make you rage-quit so you will never win it.My two cents?  Save yourself the aggravation and frustration and pass on this game.  If they EVER fix it so you can skip the end battle cutscenes then yes, by all means get it.  But I doubt they will ever do that so pass on this one.			"

												finely a game where you play as the orcs and the humans are the bad guys i really enjoyed the story in this game theres a war between the orcs tribes and the humans  and the orcs are loseing orcs that are not killed in battle are enslaved you play as a orc trying to kill the human emperor to put a stop to all the war that devastated your people now to the gameplay you play as a orc warrior and a goblin one is a tank and one is the one who dose all the stealth and range stuff dont be fooled this game isnt a real roleplaying game sure you can pick what skills you unlock and what quest you do and dont do but what you do in the game dosent really change what happens in the story and the levels are fairly linear so its more like a action game with role playing elements at least imo the voice actting isnt half bad sometimes it feels cheesy but theres some pretty funny lines in the game so i enjoyed it  and one other thing is that the combat isnt all that great like most of the time i felt like there wasnt all that much i could do and most of the time i felt that most fights couldnt be won unless i send my goblin to stealth kill a few guys til they spoted me so then my orc can kill them and the AI isnt very good like i could stealthkill someone while someone is righyt in frount of him and he wont care but sometimes they do  so i would recommend this game if you faver a game for its story over its action			"

												Purely from a writing standpoint, this is one of the most overlooked gems in the RPG genre. If you love story driven RPGs, I highly suggest considering this game. Tons of games talk about ""Mature Themes"" but this one really hits that nail on the head, and not just from the adult language (which there's a lot of). It covers racism, slavery, political ambition, violence, and betrayal. I felt both of the main characters were well written and it was interesting to see how their interactions with each other evolved as the story progressed.Now onto the actual game systems.The combat system isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. It's just like Game of Thrones, super slow mow where you can queue up 4 moves for each character. If you haven't played GoT, it's like KOTOR but without the actual pause. Difficulty of combat spikes a bit too and can be pretty hard when you don't get assassinations done before hand.The game is really linear and there's almost no exploration. There's a handful of side quests but, they need to be done right then and there. Maps are very railroady with minimal hallway detours to find an occasional goody.Each hero has 2 full trees and another tree split in half to work together/class specialty. It's by no means one of the most flexible systems in the genre but, it is far better than many others.Game also isn't a huge, 40+ hour epic. I would expect 10-25 hours depending on difficulty with combat.			"

												I just finished ""Of Orcs and Men."" I really enjoyed this console ARPG in its PC form with a gamepad. It has nice visuals, sound and music as well as a very good story with likable dual protagonists, both of whom you control throughout the adventure. The combat system which goes into slow motion when you hit a button to begin selecting up to 4 attacks or abilities and returns to normal speed when you are done is fluid, involving and fun. Switching between the characters in combat is a breeze. The streamlined UI is a pleasure to use with a gamepad. The game is very light on loot but your characters are always progressing via level ups with new skills and abilities as well as loot you acquire from chests and defeated enemies. You sometimes also get loot from merchants who can (and you'll always want to do this) upgrade your armor and weapons. The game is not about constant looting of stuff though. It is about two great characters on a quest with a good story with fun combat along the way. The Orc Arkail, is a warrior and the Goblin, Styx is a rogue who is a lot of fun to use for his stealth abilities at times. I found it best to develop Arkail as a tank and Styx as melee DPS but you can give focus to DPS on Arkail and ranged DPS on Styx if you prefer. I give it a 8 out of 10 and feel the game was underrated by professional reviews and some PC gamers alike who I think didn't give it a fair chance based on it not being a ""PC game"" but rather a console game ported to PC. It is a good solid port. I experienced no problems with it. Steam tells me I played it for 29 hours but subtracting out snacks, etc. I think it was probably more like 25 or 26 hours roughly and I took all side quests and checked everywhere for chests as I went along.

												I begin by saying Of Orcs and Men won't be for everyone. In fact I recommend this game only to fans of the tactical-RPG genre, as even action-RPG fans may be spurned. Combat is slower and more strategic then most hack and slashes (stealth can be the key factor of progression). The skill trees (or should I say circles) require a great deal of attention as they can become crucial in fights. This game does a lot of things right, but it's challenge requires perseverance. Graphics and story are top notch like most RPGs, however choice never seemed to play a real role outside of differing cutscenes/achievments. I also would've liked a stronger economy and more inventory options. If you plan to tackle this one I recommend buying it on sale that way you won't be too disappointed should you not enjoy.			"

The combat controls are clunky, the levels railroad you, and the patrolling guards don't notice that there's a fresh corpses in front of them (maybe because it was Easy mode?).

												Fantastic story! Beautiful world! Game play sucks! The line up attacks combat style, and control of two characters in combat was tedious and boring! The Goblin dies if you blink, and the Orc will rage taking control (at which point he kills the goblin) unless you constantly burn turns to calm him down. If you do take the time to calm the Orc expect to get roped every time you do so. By the end of the game I was picking rage inducing attacks to get it over with, and just playing the Goblin through combat as support for a bot that gets stuck on corners. Once the Orc rages it is just as likely to turn, and attack the Goblin so combat becomes ""Hit and run the puck away!"" The actual game play is just move, and fight. It's a ""hack and slash"" without any real control of the ""hacking and slashing"". The stealth play is like a bad joke as the enemies can only see the stealthed Goblin if its sucking their bick, or skull pucking the guy next to them. Linear  levels, and bad game play aside. I really enjoyed it! But with out levels and game play your just watching a bad CG cartoon with a good story. I fill the game makers could do better, and look forward to the prequel Styx:Master of Shadows.			"

												Pretty decent game. The artwork and environments are beautiful, but level design doesn't seem too well thought out. There's a lot of walking down hallways without much to do lacking even character dialogue to entertain you.Combat is very good. I really enjoyed the different skills that were available and the strategy that came into play in most battles. And you have to employ the strategic menu during battles or you will fail.Which is where combat was annoying. Most of the difficult battles occure immediately after a long cutscene which means if you die (and you very likely will again, and again, and again) you have to go through the cutscene (again and again and again). You can skip by pressing Esc repeatedly, but it's just incredibly frustrating. Also, the battles aren't very well balanced. I breezed through most of the game on easy so that I could enjoy the story, but then cam across maybe 3 battles that took me forever to get through. I almost just quit the game and gave up it was that frustrating.Anyway, voice acting was good and engaging but the script seemed quite stilted at points. The characters swore a lot, which I don't mind, it just seemed overdone to me and came across as the writers using swear words more as a publicity stunt rather than for dramatic emphasis. Maybe that's just me.The storyline and characters were great. Kept me interested for the duration of the game and I really enjoyed watching how the main two characters developed and got to know eachother as the game progressed.AI was a little messed up (which was also frustrating). If you ever leave one of the characters to do their own thing for a bit during combat, they are bound to do something stupid, like target the guy furthest away so they run past every other enemy and get killed on the way. Or sometimes they'll just stand there and you can't tell why. You've given them commands to carry out, you're pretty sure they haven't been stunned, but they're not responding to anything.Also, the still warm corspe of a soliders friend is apparently an everyday sight, cause they won't do anything about it. You can kill 10 people and then watch a patrol just walk over their bodies and go on their way without raising an alarm or even breaking stride. Not a game breaker, but weird for a modern game. It does make stealth assassinations a piece of cake.My recommendation. Play it on easy just for the sake of the story, otherwise the long hallways, frustrating battles and inconsistent AI aren't worth the effort.			"

Pretty much sums it up. See those screen shots? The graphics are pretty dang awesome. Wanna get in on the story before playing the game Styx: Master of Shadows?DO IT! Strategy based game, you can slow time (not stop it) to allow yourself more control during combat. Or you could play real time (though not always recommended) to go hack and slash on them enemy butts. STILL Apprehensive? Check out streams, youtube videos, ask friends. I've given you all I can.

												The story is tight, well paced (for the most part), and interesting: I've killed thousands of orcs and goblins over the years, and so it was fun to play as two of the ""bad guys"" on a mission to kill the human emperor.  The main characters are well written (despite the unnecessary profanity) and their reluctant team dynamic is fun.  The gameplay is the best part: building out both characters into the rolls I chose for them (it's clear there are several viable combinations of builds) was satisfying.  Neither character can succeed on its own so designing and implementing a team strategy was rewarding, and the challenge on normal was just right.  Each encounter felt like a discrete combat puzzle, and so I didn't mind that the levels were, almost without exception, linear pathways from one encounter to the next because I looked forward to the next encounter.  The graphics do the job: sometimes pretty, sometimes ugly, usually just fine.  The music is sparse, but has character.  The supporting cast is, for the most part, poorly acted, which is the only truly disappointing aspect of the game.In sum, if you want a combat focused RPG with two likable characters and an interesting story, and can excuse the small budget presentation, this game is definitely worth the 12-15 hours it takes to finish.

However, however epic it may plays out, it is entirely ruined by the somewhat boring and awkward gameplay system. I keep losing in small skirmishes on Easy level, and it doesn't help that my computer is often lagging (perhaps due to conflict with DirectX drive or something) too.A shame that I won't be finding out how it progresses.

												This is a game where you control a hulking orc and a cunning goblin. The combat is real-time with a pause function, and requires tactical thinking and basically no reflexes, which is a valid design choice. It has RPG elements, and the world it is set in is very grim, with human fanatics having enslaved or exterminated most of your race.I don't understand the lukewarm reception this game got. It has a unique twist on the dumb old Humans vs. Orcs cliche, and both main characters are interesting and compelling. The combat, at least at the higher difficulties, requires a lot of strategic thought and good planning, and it is just so sweet to see Arkhail break the back of the last imperial soldier at the end of a long fight. On top of everything else, the game looks incredible even on the lower graphics settings. What's not to love?!			"

												This is one of those games that you wish wasn't as bad as turned out to be.The game is a Pause Tactical RPG like Dragon Age Origins, only with obnoxious controls.They combined two characters who have independant styles of gameplay. A rogue, who is good at stealthing and assassination with a lumbering warrior who caves faces in loudly. Imagine playing Mark of the Ninja with a Giant Fire Breathing Dragon following him wherever he goes.If this game had been an Action RPG with the characters having their own separate stories, it would have been fantastic. This game was wasted potential.			"

												I can't recommend this game, which is a shame, because the concept is excellent. I was compelled to buy Of Orcs & Men by the idea of your typical fantasy setting being inverted to the point where the orcs are the heroes and the humans are the barbaric oppressors/invaders. Unfortunately, the game tries WAY too hard to be funny, edgy, and gritty when all it really needed to do was be epic in the literal sense. I don't typically mind profanity, but the dialogue is so frought with cursing, sexual innuendo, and poor attempts at wit that it alternates between feeling forced and being downright juvenile. When it isn't being juvenile, the game is constantly going out of its way to remind you that this is the F--king GRIMDARK, and everything sucks. The humans are EVIL, man. The orcs are BADASS, dude. Essentially, everything in this game seems to be a charicature with little in the way of depth. This is extremely unfortunate given the incredible potential of the setting. Less than an hour in, and I just can't play anymore. I really want to like this game, but I've seen enough. I might be willing to soldier on and hope that the dialogue and plot/character development improve, but the controls and gameplay also leave quite a bit to be desired. At the end of the day, this game just wasn't for me. There may be someone out there that would enjoy Of Orcs & Men...but I can't imagine them being older than twelve.			"

												I've tried to play this game on several different occasions and I just CAN'T get behind these controls! In my opinion, this was the wierdest control scheme in a game; EVER! Secondly, I never felt like I was in control of my character. You assign something for them to do, then they do it; while you wait and watch. Well, it's pretty quick, but you still don't feel in control. It's almost turn-based but not quite, almost real-time but not quite...I wish it would make up it's mind, because whatever it is; it doesn't work. That is to say, for ME it doesn't work. So, in truth, I cannot recommend this game. I picked it up on sale, so I didn't lose much, but that's not the point. I really, REALLY wanted to play this and enjoy it. I thought it was a great story idea, great concept. Good visuals too, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how good it looks if it's not fun to play. So, no. don't waste your time OR money, it's just not worth it.			"

												Terrible fight controls on the PC (may be its better on console). I thought that this might be an improvement on the Dragon age fight controls but it allows you even less control. DA actually looks a lot better after playing this for a while.The game is boxy, everything is like walking through a dungeon, constantly walking through predefiend paths, to allow the story to clamber on, you cannot go over objects, hide behind things properly or use stealth in any meaningful way. No Climbing, no crouching, and to get at targets you have to throw the goblin at them. The targetting is pretty automatic so its a bit like being a monkey pressing the button until you starve to death.  I got it on special but even so I'm not impressed!			"

												Wha- who- how the... I've never encountered a game that in almost every way was good. Thoroughly enjoyable, all features at the very least adequate. All except one, that one bad feature completely, utterly destroys the game. That combat system... just... who the bloody hell saw that, played that and thought ""yep, that's a functional and enjoyable way to play the game. Let's ship it""?!  The combat system works like this, LB and RB each bring up a radial menu with either offensive or defensive attacks. Key phrase there; ""defensive attacks"". Even your defence is just a slightly quicker offence. There doesn't seem to be a way to block or dodge anything. It works by giving the two characters orders like a turn-based strategy game but in realtime. Well it slows down time when you open the attack menus but you have so little control over the characters actions during a fight. It clearly should've been a hack'n'slash affair. Everything else about it was alright.I've played this for about two hours, a bit of it was offline. I've also played Styx and that had some issues with combat but by God it's infinitely better than this.			"

I find myself not struggling with the strategy of how to take down the enemies but with getting the combat mechanics to work as I want them to when the fight begins. This struggle completely overtakes the enjoyment of the game unfortunetely. Bad controls are one of the most frustrating things in games, and for that reason I can't reccommend it.			"

												isnt ♥♥♥♥ just a wonderful word. ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥.FUUUUUUUCK.""♥♥♥♥,"" is essentially the whole game's dialouge. Nothing but pointless and repetitive swearing. I understand the premise and in war swearing is commonplace; that whole swearing like a sailor metaphor rings a bell. Although I WISH they would swear like a sailor, it would at least be more colorful. Every two minutes its, ""look at me I said the word ♥♥♥♥."" Yes, ♥♥♥♥ is a versitile word but there are a variety of other swear words that can be used to articulate communications between characters. And dont give me the crap about how ""theyre dumb, theyre orcs and only know how to kill."" The first scene shows complex communication and articulation, Its a very wierd disconnect to go from ""Oh, why thank you. Look at my manners, arent I so polite,"" to ""♥♥♥♥. Me swing ♥♥♥♥ing sword. You bleed all over ♥♥♥♥ing ground,"" (not actual quotes). Was the script proof read by a 13 year old who just discovered he can swear among friends?Oh right this is a game. WHY DO I HAVE TO MICRO MANAGE EVERYTHING? I undestand the game developer probably didnt want another hack and slash game but this is not the way to do it, Im just hacking and slashing really slow. I also understand that other games have done this sort of mocromanaging well such as dragon age: origins.The way this game's comabt works is that you have to issue commands on the fly in a slowed down period which essentially pauses the fight every 20 seconds. Lets return to DA:O, you created a preset queue of attacks to perform based on certian battle conditions with respect to the individual character's skills and abilities. Because its all preset the combat happens a lot faster and creates more complex combat scenarios. In DA:O you can interupt individual characters from performing their attack queues (or even quickly switch to a different preset queue) to issue specific commands to address a unique battle situation. In Orcs and Men, you dont get that tactical experience, the attack queue is created on the spot and then terminated, repeating every few seconds. This would be a thousand times more bareable if I could issue my character to auto attack when I dont have attcks in the queue.Although, I do like the slow down aspect of the battle rather than a complete pause because that forces the player to act and not just sit there and figure out every small detail.

												I must say that the combat system wasn't enjoyable.  If you're fans of Dragon Age Origins like I am, OOaM doesn't even compare.  It's very barebones, and the levels are EXTREMELY linear.  There is only one path you can go, and the occasional fork in the roads off the beaten path are underwhelming.  The storyline was enjoyable though which was the only reason for me to continue playing, and the voice acting is pretty good.  Whenever this game is on a steam sale for a VERY deep discount then it MIGHT be worth it for the storyline, but other than that... stay clear.

												While it does look nice and has decent voice acting, the camera often gets in the way. The core gameplay is battle heavy,  and relies on you selecting skills to use in a Baldur's Gate/Dragon Age kind of way, which is awkward since the rest of the game sets it up to be a third-person beat 'em up. Since you have to pick every skill by hand (or set up to 9 to a hotkey), each battle wears on your nerves. On harder difficulties, it's not clear what tactic to use against who, basically making you use all of the skills and hope something sticks. Of Orcs and Men tries, but doesn't quite get its main aspects right. And that makes it quite a disappointment.			"

I've really been trying to give this game a chance so I've played it for the last 3 days, but there's really nothing here to recommend. The gameplay is boring and you feel like you barely have control of your characters during combat. The story is bland and the writing is immature with the author throwing in swearing in a poor attempt to make it a ""mature"" story and the animations that go along with the dialogue often keep playing for several seconds after the characters have finished talking. On top of all of this, the level design is linear in the worst way with your characters barely able to move even a few inches off the designated path.

The lighting, effects, models, everything graphics wise looks good. The sounds and music are well put together. The plot isn't all that bad either. Fantasy creatures (orcs) are being hunted down by humans. Nothing completely original, but it's interesting. The combat system, while annoying at times, isn't really all that bad. It plays like KotOR did, where you select abilities and watch it play through, stopping to add more in the queue. But RPG's are all about the story. You want to know more about the characters and the world they live in. This game rushes through all that. Every now and again they give you a pretty good scene, but it is still bogged down in all the pointless stuff from before. It had something, but it just couldn't deliver on where it counted.			"

												Criminally underrated RPG, but then I can't say it's for everyone.What I loved: The story, the setting, the character interaction. It has a very captivating world with a pretty good mythology, and the two main characters are among the most memorable in any recent game I've played. The relationship between Arkhail and Styx feels very genuine —you really get to care about those two.The downside: The combat system is quite a bit loose, the AI is stupid. The combat mechanics consist in pausing, choosing targets, queueing attacks and abilities, and constantly switching between Arkhail and Styx, making sure their actions complement each other. It works for the most part but it's not very refined and you can bump into some pretty frustrating moments as a result. The way certain fights are designed doesn't help too much either, and if you leave the AI to make its own decisions (by only focusing on one character, that is), you'll be screwed most of the time. It's far from being unplayable, but I can see these problems turning off a lot of people.It's a flawed game, but a very charming one. Recommended if you think you can get past the somewhat flimsy combat and you don't mind its linear, basic design.			"

												Of Orcs and Men is, at its core, a tactical RPG about the interesting symbiosis between a rogue and a warrior in a fantasy RPG.  The warrior has a stun attack with a high chance of being dodged.  The rogue has an attack which prevents the target from dodging for 5 seconds.  Put them together and you feel clever!  This gameplay works, and we've seen it work in other games.  For example, the original Dragon Age had the exact same symbiosis between a rogue and a warrior and it worked great there.  However....This is a negative review, but I'll start with the good:+ Very glad to see some variety in story.  The greenskins as protagonists is an interesting angle.  The story itself is mostly good.+ Graphics are decent.+ Combat has enough depth to be interesting, with lots of abilities which synnergize with each other to produce new effects.The bad:- The voice actors sound like they're muddling through lines in a second language.  Worse, it sounds like several of the lines are translated literally from the original french, meaning clever local idioms just become nonsense.- Game was obviously written solely with an xbox controller in mind.  When you reach a hill and have to move your mouse back to look 'up', you have to pull it about three mousepadlengths because the Y coordinate has a different sensativity than the X coordinate.  This cannot be changed in the options.-Combat is a miserable, stumbling affair.  This is the killer.  If you're skimming, read this part.As I mentioned above, the whole game is about doing clever things with your rogue and warrior TOGETHER.  So you'd assume that, generally, they target the same enemy, right?  Wrong.  Their autotargetting ALWAYS chooses different enemies, so I'm being totally serious when I say 50% of my game time was simply smashing the Q and E keys paging through interminable lists of targets trying to get them to both hit the same guy.  This would be less of a problem if the click selection works, but it doesn't.  The camera is locked 2 feet from the action, usually staring at a wall, and clicking an enemy is just as likely to select the guy 20 meters behind him as it is to select him.This is a game about combat in which I like everything except the combat.  The combat is awful.  Can not recommend.			"

												I wanted to love this game, and it has a great deal of potential, however, this team has a serious game breaking controller issue.  The controls are a jumbled mess.  Even with autodetect on a Windows 8.1 system, a licensed and perfectly mapped Xbox 360 controller, and a ton of attempts to adjust the controller settings in the game, it is impossible to engineer a fix for this problem on the user side.  I never really got to play the actual game.  I have no save data, no progress, and no controls to use.  I essentially just idly pranced around and tried to open the menu, which was oddly mapped to L3, until I got stuck again.  In fact, the only 2 inputs that were properly mapped were lateral movement and back (left / right on the d-pad and B).  That's literally all that worked properly with the controls.I honestly would like a refund for being issued an unplayable game, but I'm not likely to receive one.  The devs won't even acknowledge there's a problem with the PC version of the game.  I believe Steam should pull this game down until the developers acknowledge and fix the problem.  My controller works perfectly fine with all other controller supporting games I own.			"

												A dark fantasy RPG buddymovie with reversed roles, where you play on the side of the greenskins and humans are the bad guys. A game that tries to pick up sensitive topics like racial conflicts. Sadly it fails miserably.What remains is a cool idea executed in the worst way possible. Edgy writing, nonsensical storyarc, HORRENDOUS combat; I did not enjoy my time with this game, and I really wanted to like it. I'm not opposed to a sequel since giving up this universe right away would be a tragedy (and indeed we got a prequel centered around the originstory of one of the main characters) but there's a lot of room for improvement.Good soundtrack though I guess.Main theme for this game:

												so.. very disappointed in this game. I had high hopes for this game, the plot sounded cool and the art style was neat. Sadly, that all fades away in the usual generic gameplay that Spider is notorious for... If you are not familar MOST of their games have a very bland clunky slow combat system.. Think the first Witcher game but worse. Another thing that always confuses me in their games especially this one.. Using modern day sayings and off handed curses in a fantasy setting just seems... odd to me. The writing is meh and the combat is blah, I bought this game part of a RPG Bundle and I'm very sad to say that everything in that bundle was pretty bland and I regret spending any money on any of their games. I'd stay away.			"

												WARNING: *THIS IS NOT A REVIEW FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS COMPLETED THE GAME*    This is one of the worst games I have played. ""Then why the hell did you buy it?"", you ask. Well I fell for the old, ""edited screen shots and cinematic only trailers"" gag. The game looks awful when actually being played, and the story is no where near as interessting as you may think. Although I have only played fifty minutes of the game; it has already bored me to hell, back and then back to hell again, from which I have not returned.    The combat is what lets this game fall to the bottom of my pile. The stacked movement system consists of: defence and attack moves. The combat is worse than Kirby's combat, and Kirby doesn't have a damned combat system.    To conclude this short review/rant, do not buy this game!			"

												The graphics and the story are fine.  The combat system is ok, but a little limited. There were two bigger drawbacks for me.  The character advancement is a little too basic.  You pick up new skills, but don't get to do any customization.  The story is too linear.  I personally prefer a little more of an open world where I can make decisions on what I want to do. Lastly the foul language is overdone.  I don't need to hear the F word 50 times to enjoy the story.			"

												This game is a tricky one.Pros:+Very nice storyline (Main reason to buy this game)+Two nice skilltrees+Decent graphics+Nice sounds+No bugsCons:-GameplayI open the gameplay problem a bit.Think about classic RTS where you look on your characters from the sky, pause the game, give orders and watch the fun from the above. Goood.Now, in Of Orcs and Men you do the same. The problem is that you play in over-the-shoulder view and you control characters with WASD. It gives you the feeling that you should be able to do some real-time fighting.The fact that your characters can't really do anything on their own, means you have to control all of their moves using slow-motion, in order to survive. So you can't really do real-time fighting.That's biggest thing that bugged me throught the whole game and it made the gameplay not-so-enjoyable..			"

												Do you wanna know why I have the gall to write a review after playing it for 6 minutes?COMBAT SYSTEM > It's really-really-really bad.The combat runs in realtime, whenever you open up a list of available commands time slows a little bit, I suspect they do this to adds suspense during your decision making process. However, what actually happened was a very boring, very unresponsive combat. What you're doing is basically input commands into queue and wait for the commands to come up the top of the queue and see your character execute it in a very boring way (animation-wise). It's just.. really bad. An RPG lives and breath through the combat system. It's what makes or breaks the game. It's not the story, not the graphic, not the music, no. It's the combat system. Why? Because you're going to spend a lot of your time fighting that's why.and my experience from the first two encounter was so horrible that I decided to drop this game and uninstalled. If I didn't get this game for free I would've refund it.			"

												Ive had my eye on this game for quite some time, and finally decided to grab it, as well as Styx:Master of Shadow(Update: I do not recommend Styx:Master of Shadow)..  Man am I sorry i waited so long! It appeared to be more of an action type game, until i looked closer, and realized it had real time with pause combat.. Similar to Dragon Age:Origins, its also got radial ability wheels.. You control 2 characters.. The first Arkail, the mountainous, hulking Orc Berserker, who doubles as a tank.. Then Styx, the tiny comic, assassin, who doubles as a ranged damager.. Each has 2, to 2.5 Ability wheels, depending on how you spec them out..You purchase and upgrade several abilitiesa in each stance, and something else i wont spoil..Combat was very strange at first, as theres very little advanced tutorial or guide to figure out what the color of the rings on enemies mean, what certain status mean, etc.. I do NOT suggest using a controller, though completely possible i found targetting, and combat to be difficult, and far mroe precise with the m+kb.. Minus the ""Tactics"", its every bit that DA:O was!The sound was good.. The music was fitting for every aspect be it combat, strolling, conversation, etc.. Heavy attacks have a satisfying thud, and voices were very well done.. Especially when you consider that its Orc, and Goblin speech.. Lip syncing was pretty bad though..Graphics were servicable, but did their job.. the character models, and their gear were very detailed, but textures, and environment were less so.. It did not take away from the experience.. And thats coming from someone who places graphics high on my requirements list.. The maps constantly changed, and it never got old, as you were constantl;y moving to new locations.. Forests, snowy mountains, ghettos, island, etc.. Very good..Enemy AI were not stupid, but nothing astounding either, which is what i expected from a game on a budget.. Its better than many games.. They seem to follow the rules of aggro, and basically play their role.. Crossbowmen will thankfully switch to melee, rather tyhan standing there stupidly taking clubs to the face. Each enemy requires different types of damage to be taken down effectively.. Light, medium, and heavy attacks.. Armor piercing, poisons, destabalizing, stuns, etc.. They also have armor, and damage values..And finally, the reason thsi game shines... The story.. I was very, VERY pleasantly surprised by the story.. Where there are still cliche moments (and how can there not be this day in age.. Everythings been done) it was very good.. Twists, betrayal, choice, and consequence, trust, and more.. Its told from the view of the Orcs, who are being driven to extinction, and  put to slavery by humans.. Goblins are little more than critters, and are treated as rats.. They are mindless killing machines, who cannot speak, or have any advanced thought..Or can they? Humans are using Orcs to build massive towers, and teh Emperor is takign more and more land.. hes going to try and allign the human race with the elves, and dwarves to finish off the ""greenskins"".. You, the last of your tribe, The Butcher, are sent to kill the emperor before this happens.. You will need a guides to get you past the tower walls.. Enter Styx..I wont go any further, as it could spoil some things.. Everything mentioned about story is told to the polayer in the opening scene of the game, and probably in the game description tbh..  Bottom line, its n excellent game, and one you can replay, with different styles, and choices.. At first the combat may be confusing, or atleast some of the mechanics, but this only lasts a few minutes, and i was able to figure out the details quickly.. Do yourself a favor, and pick this one up.. Even at full price i would recommend it, but i was able to get it on sale for about $5.. I anxiously await a sequel!  With extremely linear levels, and playing on Normal, the campaign took me 20.5hrs, and i loved every minute!Edit: Sorry for the poor format.. Ive rewritten this 3 different times, and Steam seems to be suffering from something with the Review system,.. It wont post, or acts as if it has, and when returning, the review does not exist.. After my 3rd attempt this week, i just wanted it done, as its a great game!			"

												While I didn't like the game myself, I still think it's a good game. The graphics are great, the atmosphere better, I just didn't appreciate the combat. Something like this would have benefited from a more action oriented / responsive combat system in my opinion. The combat system is a mix of tactics and skill stacking. You press Space to pause the game, then load up pre-defined attacks into a stack that get executed top-down. If that's your cup of a tea, then this game will probably be a rare gem. "

												Not bad, but get it on sale.+ 2 very colourful characters (near the top tiers, generates feels);+ Good voice acting and script;+ Music was alright;- Level design is a tunnel that connects point A to B;- Combat is plain annoying;Overall the game is worth to play through before you play Styx (it has this one thing that explains his origins). It feels as if ALL of the budget was spent to polish the 2 protagonists, starting from their textures down to the voice acting. Not much was left for anything else it seems. I am seriously sad that such a great duo of personalities were wasted on such a mediocre game design. Whatever RP elements there are such as levels and items - its all there just so that you could slap an RPG tag on it and min-max your stat, if you like that sort of thing. Personally I chose whichever has the dankest textures.This ""game"" would have more value if it were a movie, seriously.Play it on easy or something and pump your band of 2 with offensive abilities and have fun.

												This game was fun, its a typical action RPG with linear level design, story is good, characters are sympathetic and if you get used to the combat system than its a clear upvote :)The combat system is action menu where you can select up to 4 actions to be executed in a row meanwhile the game is paused (very slow to be exact)Who doesn't like this menu can map up to 10 attacks to the numkeys (overall 22 skills per player) and use a key or the  mousewheel to change the enemy to play this game in real timeThis game gets very challenging with the difficulties and at some points the game is just ridiculous if you skilled your character unsuitable for the situationThe pathfinding of the not controlled characters is fine and rarely get stuck, the most annoying part of the game is that you can't skip some ""important"" cutscenes, dialogs and other scenes are skipableThe graphic and animation are fine and game runs without any lag or spikes and looks good overall			"

Pros+ Looks pretty good for a 2012 game+ Runs smoothly (good port)+ Controller or Mouse/Keyboard work+ Some interesting plot twists+ Interesting premise + Voice acting for Styx and Arkail is strong+ Length feels about right+ Rage mechanic is different and something new to meNegatives - Repetitive combat- Combat is unintersting - on higher difficulty levels you use the same conition abilities over and over hoping for stuns etc- Few Gear/Item choices and feels like an after thought (i wore one set of armour on Arkail from chapter 1 until completion)- Camera angle/control is terrible- Overuse of the same faces on NPC after NPC- At time of writing £19.99 is a little on the expensive side- Arkails constant roaring and styx giggle in every cut scene.....

												Bought it this morning, finished just now, and I gotta say I had a BLAST playing this!The art-style, the scenery the atmosphere, voice acting and the story itself were PERFECT!The combat system had a few kinks and exploits, but nothing gamebreaking, and not so horrible that it makes the game unbearable.If you got the money and its on sale, grab it. Hell grab it even when its not on sale, if you dont like the combat just push through for the story, the dialogue is amazing.A big 9/10 because of the combat system, else it would've been a 10/10.

												Took about 15 hours to beat on Medium, I recommend this game. Good humor, good game (it seems they may have had a bit of a budget issue but it doesn't show much), and the gameplay is good. As others have mentioned here the combat involves picking different moves from a skill wheel, with no cool downs (some of Styx's moves require Concentration though). Styx Master of Shadows is a prequel to this game, which I also recommend. As for order of playing them I think either one could be played first, I don't think anything would be spoiled playing one before the other.Overall it feels unique, and I may play it again sometime to pick different dialogue options or try different builds.

												This game could have been much better.At first I was excited at the sights of a game which focused on the Greenskins as the protagonists rather than the usual bad guys, but after having played through the game I'm kinda stuck in the middle.The game is really story-driven because other than the story it doesn't really perform well on other aspects. Gameplay is very linear aside from a few optional side-quests which really do not matter most of the time. Choices don't really have an impact on the story and parts of the level design would make one wonder why it's even there in the first place. The graphics are alright at best but the combat leaves much to be desired - targeting can be a pain at times and the reset of skills on an enemy's death is rather annoying to say the least.If it wasn't for my love for the Greenskins, I probably wouldn't have bothered with this. The story in itself (which is supposed to be it's strong part) was rather plain and predictable. If anything I would say the best part of this game is it's amazing soundtrack. If I didn't know any better I'd say the combat music is what has driven me to finish the game.All in all.. I guess it can be considered enjoyable if you're really into Greenskins like me. Otherwise I wouldn't bother.. Glad to have picked it up on a sale because it's not worth the full retail price.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. I will admit the first 10 to 15 minutes the combat felt really awkward but you get used to it. There's a bit of strategy to it, which I enjoyed. Overall though the story and characters were a main draw for me. When I completed the game I was tempted to play through it again (it's not too long).			"

												This game has two modes.  Childishly easy... to red eye frustration.  Funny thing is no matter what difficulty you pick you will still hit both of these things in the game.  The story is good, the atmosphere is good, the characters are a little two dimensional but decently flushed out, the game play is and control is decent, level design is very march down the hallway style but whatever.  I just can get over the bad design of some of the encounters.  There really isn't a stratagy other than hope the RNG is with you this time.			"

												Eh, it's ok.  Not great, but maybe see if you can get it on sale for cheap.This is an adventure RPG.  You follow a linear set path, deal with enemies a few at a time, find some hidden treasures, change and upgrade your armor and weapons, and gain experience points from combat to level up your skills.  The world is a ""fantasy"" setting where the humans have come together and formed an empire after a long war against the Orcs.  Now the emperor is running a campaign of genocide against anything with green skin.  The dwarves and elves have joined him, mostly out of fear for their own people.In this game, you play as two characters.  You can switch control from one to the other on the fly, but whichever one you are NOT controlling will be active with AI control.  The AI is stupid as a bag of rocks, by the way.  The big orc is loud and likes to hit people in the face.  He has a mission:  to save his species from genocide by assassinating the human emperor.  The little goblin is tasked with helping the orc get through the city so he can do the deed.  The little goblin is very sneaky; if he enters stealth mode then the big guy will stop following you and wait until you exit stealth mode before he runs to catch up.  While in stealth mode, many times you can make a fight easier - or avoid a fight completely - by sneaking behind the enemy and assassinating them one at a time.  If a fight does break out because you are witnessed killing a soldier, then you will be alternating control between the two.  You can set a chain of commands for each of them, but they can only remember four commands at once.  Each character has his own upgrade tree, for which you gain points when you level-up.  There is one area that has SHARED commands for both of them, and each character has two fighting styles to upgrade.  The goblin has a path for ranged attacks (dagger toss) and another path for up-close fighting.  The orc has a path for strong but slow attacks, and another for attacks that allow him to also block or parry incoming blows.The graphics are pretty well done.  The music isn't awful, but also not great.  The story is interesting because it is rare that you get to play as a ""bad guy"" but still have it feel like you're doing the right thing.  The combat, in my opinion, is pretty terrible though.  And the path you are allowed to follow is extremely limited.  That does detract from the fun story aspects a bit, so I only give this one a rating of ""Eh, it's ok"" whereas if the combat system had been done a little better I might actually call it a good game.Story:  good stuff.Combat:  terrible, though the stealth assassination style is amusing for a little while.Still worth playing?  Sure, if you can get it for just a few bucks.  Don't shell out big money for this one though.If you try this one and enjoy it, consider another game in the series:  ""Styx: Master of Shadows"" which as of writing this I still have not played.

												Of Orcs and Men is a game with some interesting ideas but ultimatly fails in a whole lot more areas than it actually succeeds, which seems to be a common theme with this developer as I'm playing through their games... Anyways let's get to it shall we? Combat I've had to rewrite this section actually because originally I had a big rant about the combat here but it took way too many characters and didn't leave much room for the other stuff in this review, you can still  read it if you're interested though [pastebin.com], anyways here's the short and to the point versionThe combat is pretty bad, and playing on harder difficulties only makes it worse, you control 2 characters, a big warrior orc and a small rogue goblin, they both have unique abilites that you select from a weird wheel which slows time when it pops up as you press the space key, suffice to say it's quite clunky because the game doesn't know if it wants to be turn based or real time and it's just this really weird ""strategic"" combat as a resultIt's a very clunky system that feels unpolished, you can't dodge / block damage in a straightforward way, it's all up to some stats and RNG, same for your enemies blocking / countering / dodging and the stupid rage mechanic for your big orc character (I go into more detail about that on the longer version) and you're always overwhelmed in numbers which limit a lot your options since only a few skills can be upgraded to be uninterruptable because the enemies interrupt most of your other attacks by hitting youA lot of encounters devolved into me using the goblin character running around in circles to avoid enemies to revive the big orc, getting 1-2 hits with him, dying and getting revived again over and over again until everyone was dead, sometimes they got hits on the goblin aswell and if he died it got even worse by the two characters reviving each other all the time and barely getting any hits in to kill the enemies, but you have to play as only 1 character in some sections which can make things even more frustratingYou can also use stealth to 1 hit K.O dudes with your goblin before you get spotted and it's a very useful way of thinning the enemies ranks before you inevitably have to face them in ""real"" combat, but there are a lot of fights triggered by cutscenes or with enemy placement which you can't stealth your way out of so there's that  Exploration So yeah, safe to say I'm not really happy with the combat at all, it's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t a lot of times and I haven't been frustrated like this with a game in a long time, the real kicker is that you know what you do for like 90% of the whole game? Just go through straight corridors walking very slowly as a big fat orc (or a small goblin) until you get into slightly bigger rooms with a bunch of dudes in them, kill them all, go through another corridor, get to another slightly bigger room, rinse and repeat until you get to the objective at the end of the map, for the whole game, it seriously takes its toll upon you and the first time I played this game was for around 1-2 hours, but I really thought I've been playing for the whole day, serisouly it felt like an eternity, this game's combat really grinds upon your very soul and the only real exploration is that there's maybe a slightly shorter branching corridor which leads to another big room with lots of dudes in it and some loot, or you get a sidequest from an NPC in one of the hub areas and you go through the exact same formula of going through corridors and then big rooms again Story The story while it may seem interesting at times, but it's pretty meh, there's nothing really all that special about it, I think the main thing here is that it's different in a way not many other games explore because you play as Orcs and Goblins which usually are the evil bad guys and all that, but yeah this time around the humans are evil and conquered almost all the orcs and enslaved them, you're in control of an orc named Arkail, a strong elite warrior which is part of the Bloodjaws clan on a crazy suicide mission to kill the human emperor and hopefully make things better for his kin, and also Styx, a goblin rogue type character helping him along the wayThe voice acting is a mixed bag as usual with this developer and the same can be said about the characters, some can be pretty likeable like Styx which is probably one of the reasons he's got his own game which maybe I'll try at some point and then there are your generic villains or the twist which you could see from a mile away near the endBut ultimatly the story is just that, it has a nice / different coat of paint with it's setting, I'll have to admit that's what kept me going but it's pretty average and I didn't feel any real sense of satisfaction after completing it (aside from being free from the horrifying combat maybe) and at no point I really felt invested or cared for any of the characters, the only real fun one is Styx to be quite honest, the others vary on the spectrum from fine to stereotypical trope ""x"" or ""y"" characterYou have some choices but few actually matter, a lot of it it the same whatever you choose with some differences only being like a line of dialogue, the bigger changes / minor consequences are a result of sidequests if you wish to go for those Conclusion All in all I'd have to say that while it's different it's a pretty mediocre game, you're doing the same thing for pretty much all of it i.e the ""Exploration"" section from this review and sadly that same thing is just not all that fun to do, maybe the story might intrigue you in some way but I wouldn't hold by breath on it, it's sad to say this because this game did have some cool potential but it just didn't come to fruition, honestly don't bother with this one, but if you REALLY want to give it a go for whatever reason at least do yoruself a favor and wait to pick it up on sale			"

												First let me pre-face Spider Studios is not some huge company with a million dollar budget for every video game they makeThat said I gave this game a solid 8/10I had a lot of trouble figuring out the combat system, and how to make Styx and Arkail work together, but that was only because it was actually a pretty unique fighting system, and unlike modern games every battle isn't super easy.Instead the game is actually challenging so in combat you actually have to think and work for your victory and not just spam click for satisfaction. The story: It was so dark and interesting. At first it seemed stereotypical and storybookish, but as it develops the characters become very flushed out and you have a very dark and grim world painted before you, as you are given a deeper understanding of the characters and their personal struggles, but also the significance of your quest in this gameThe graphics are pretty good, especially for when this was made!You'll have an interesting time playing around with styx and arkail as you customize both to compliment one another(otherwise you probably won't be able to beat the game lol) It had one REALLY contorversial scene(monastery part) where I, who am usually silent while playing video games, audibly shouted ""WHAT THE F***?!""Look past that scene and its an amazing game worth getting!

												Well this game was pretty unique experience. Very good story, cool main characters and great visuals. Also we are being introduced to very well done fighting mechanics. They may be clunky but, when you get used to them the combat is fun as hell. If you like tactitacal approach to combat that is. It's no hack'n'slash for sure. I don't want to say too much, for I think that even talking about some of the gameplay elements would spoil the fun. I bought this game without getting to know what kind of product that is, without reading reviews, without watching videos. I can say, I'm happy about it, because it was really fresh experience. But if you are reading this, you propobly want to know more before buying, so let's get to it.If you want it short here are pros and cons:GOOD-combat system-story-main characters-statistic based, old school RPG elements-great world design-nice graphics-harsh atmoshpere-great dynamics between two protagonists-can be really challanging-musicBAD-waaaaay too short (I finished the game within 11 hours. Pretty bad for RPG-like title)-linear (linear locations <<even if nicely designed>>, linear story <<almost never when you are given a choice, your choice matters at all>>)-starts being way less challanging in the late game-can get wearisome if you try to play it without breaks-some of the secondary characters are poorly dubbed (especially human ones)So that's it for a shot way of talking about the game.The story evolves around an orc Arkail and goblin Styx. This duo is well writen and it's fun to watch how their relations evolve through the game. So, our orcish protagonist is facing a mission: kill the racist Emperor and stop the genocide of the orcs. Styx is being introduced as his guide around the human kingdom. The first part of the game is honestly not a killa. We are moving and fighting around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s sunken in rain and mud. Quickly we can see the differneces between the two of our protagonists, not only in their appearances or way of thinking. Arkail is a tough warrior, kind of tank i'd say. Styx on the other hand is thief-like chracter, we can use him to silently eliminate some of the enemies before the real fight. After that he can stun or damage armor of the enemies to help Arkail deal bigger damage, and also make his own attakcs more deadly.After getting through the first parts of the game (that is after getting beyond the Wall) we change monotonous environment and story gets more dynamic. We are constantly hearing some funny talk between Styx and Arkail, which is nice, because game amtosphere does not feel so inflated. I must say, that if you're a fan of looting, you will be disappointed. There is not that much of equipment to choose from, although i never felt bad because of that, it was just the right amount.From technincal point of view it's well made product. Sound-wise the game is really great. Especially soundtrack which is kinda unique in its vibes and atmosphere. Graphicly OOAM is also nicely done. Orcish characters are looking amazing, human ones on the other hand not always. Locations are always good looking even if sometimes monotonous as I mantioned before. I didn't get across too many bugs. The most annoying problem I've encounterd was that from time to time one of our heroes, the one we weren't controlling at the moment, liked to get stuck on some obstacles (sometimes even invisible ones...).Two biggest flaws of OOAM is that it's short (11 hours, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...) and linear. And it's being linear in both cases: story and locations. Non of your choices matter and places you visit are roads from point a to point b. Which is sad, because with that design i'd like to spend much more time sightseeing.To summarise: this game is kind of a flawed gem. It's well written, has great combat system, awesome music and great visuals. But the construction of the world (tunnel like levels) and story so short... well it hurts a little. However, despite these to thing I hade a lot of fun, and I do not regret those few euros I've spent on this game, and I recommend it. Not to everybody, because it's not a game for everybody. But, if you look for something more ambitious and not-so-dynamic (but awesome!) tactical fighting system does not scare you, ""Of Orcs And Man"" might be this, what you are looking for.			"

												When you first start this game up it will be hard to get past the odd controls (keyboard and mouse, i didn't use a controller) and after playing some of this developers other games it was a challenge to go forward.  But it turns out that this was actually an enjoyable action title with an interesting enough story.  It doesn't have the depth of many other titles in the genre and is pretty linear in nature.  The stealth is fun but limited to a single take down type.  Combat can be frustrating at first due to an unfamiliar mechanic/style but it gets manageable as time goes on.  The game starts out a bit rough until you can get a few key skills for Ark so that he can properly tank, but after that it becomes a cake walk.  Not the greatest but certainly worth a play through.  Especially if you pick it up on sale. I sat down for a few hours in a single day and beat it start to finish.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  By today's standards the textures/graphics are pretty poor and quite a bit of the voice acting leaves a lot to be desired but in the end the game won me over.I enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters and liked the challenging combat system that reminded me of KOTOR.  The story was prety basic and usually on rails but sometimes I don't want an open world as those can tend to be exhausting.If its on sale definitely give it a go for an alternative take on the regular fantasy genre.

												Pros:-First game I've seen that tellls you flat out ""Going berserk is the worst tactical solution you could make"".-You may be wondering what place a goblin has in a game called 'Of Orcs And Men'? Well I did too, and the game gave a more than satisfying answer.-'Throw the halfling goblin' at its finest.-One of those precious few games that show you the world through the bloodthirsty, mindless, slaughter-happy monster's point of view.-Tactics. If you think you can win this game using default attacks and/or using one character as if this was a 3rd persong hack-and slash game, then you're gonna have a bad time.-Interesting fights and choices of attacks.Cons:-Equipment doesn't scale up with difficulty. I finished the game using some of the equipment from the first chapter, and I had more trade-points (money) then I could find a use for.-Repititive hand gestures (not that kind).-Stealth system is extremely primitive\simplistic. You can walk in front of enemies in broad daylight and they wouldn't notice you. As a stealth game enthusiast, that just felt so wrong for me.			"

												I just beat this game mere moments ago and i have never loved a story so much. If your willing to put up with the bad faces of male humans, the poor lip syncing, and the excesive language; you've got a fanatsic story, great graphics (2012), lovable characters, awesome combat systems, and an addiction. (I have never had to tell myself ""you need to stop, it's been too long"" till now.) If I look at this game realistically it's probably an 8/10. But if I look at this game with how much enjoyment I got out of it its a 9.5/10. So whatever you do; don't listen to the negative reviews from the people who only played this game for 45 minutes and judged it too quickly. They dont know what they're talking about.

												Eh, it grew on me. Initial dialog was like written by a teen that just learned about cusswords, but it gets better...ish. Not a phenominal game, but no bugs that I ran into during my completion of medium difficulty. I did get invested in the story so that's a win, and it throws in some nice twists and it really feels like a journey through a diverse set of areas and situations. I feel like this would have been better served as a 2-player 3rd-person action game, but it's not. All that aside it's fine and controls like Knights of the Old Republic and it works fine mechanically. Each character has interesting options to pursue and ways to build your characters. Definitely worth it on sale. I'm pretty confused by one character being named Barimen though...since he's a main character in Styx: Master of Shadows which is supposed to happen before this game...Yea, it's definitely worth 30$ in my book. I've gotten 20ish hours out of it and I probably won't replay it at higher difficulties since enemies just have loads more dmg/hp/defense but same old dummies it seems.			"

												If you enjoy fairly linear RPGs this game is pretty great.  It's got a solid story and some pretty good character development.  The items in the game are mostly pointless and there's not much exploring to be done but the length feels perfect.  It wraps up in a couple days so you can finish without sinking too much time and before you lose interest.  It's a great story and you get to be the big hulking evil lookin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for once.

												How could i say?  It is definitly a Cyanide creation. It contains the originality and humours that are their signatures.Interesting Characters and storyline with a lot of humour. The two main charaters especialy, their relation and background are interesting and fun.As far as the fighting is goes, after smalls difficulties (camera and selection) at first it came to me rather naturally and i took pleasure in it, not the best but definitly playable.I saw a comment where one complains about unsurmontable ♥♥♥♥♥ of difficulties, and how we could make the goblin  only DPS and the orc tanks. That is not only false but explain why he had those ♥♥♥♥♥. As for myself i had to drop the dificulty only once for a very particular fight (a charater fight without his stuff). The key is to have the two charaters well balanced and not too much specialised! The scenario is good, with climax, twist and nice punchlines. Personnaly i love this game but..We see that the main charaters have a complicated bakground in a complete universe but you won't go as deep into it as you would have wanted. That is because the game is too short. They could have keep the same five acts but made them more thick, long and make us immerge deeper into the univers and the charaters ( who deserve it).The same way the inventory and merchant système is way too shallow, enough to make hungry but not for satisfaction.That is only wrong i find to this game. In short it is too short,  for me anyway because i enjoyed every seconds i played.Well if you have trouble playing outside of mainstream, stay clear, But you want discovered a little gemestone go for it!Ps: The same charaters and world of : Styx master of shadow			"

												There are many mechanics that are left to be desired and there are several situations in the story line that make you wonder why the devs didn't make it a playable part of the game. That said though this game is a lot better than it gets credit for. Voice acting isn't the best ever but it's certainly passable. The main characters seem to actually have a team style relationship, which is good since you play both characters throughout the story. Level design isn't amazing, there are a lot of nooks and areas that look like they should be 100% accessible but aren't. But it's also not the worst I've seen. The game employs a stealth mechanic but there's not a way to stealth through an entire area as you play both characters at once and only one character can stealth. That doesn't mean it doesn't have it's place, it's still very useful.Overall the RPG mechanics are pretty solid. Both characters get attribute points when they level up as well as a new skill to learn or upgrade. And both characters skills play off eachothers strengths and weknesses quite well. You'll obtain gear from a few chests and sacks or at a vendor, not from combat. Items are upgradeable, but only once and have different attributes that fit a few different play styles.Combat itself is probably the most dissapointing. You'll have to que up attacks thru a combat menu for each character and watch it take place rather than have direct control yourself. But really as the game progresses the combat mechanics have a more tactical feeling and it starts to become more natural.You'll get some choices to pick through in dialogue menus, but there's only a couple that actually have any real affect in the game.I liked my playthrough of this game. The story is kind of fresh feeling, if a bit predictable at times. Gives a feeling of many intelligent species and races, rather than the typical feeling of orcs and goblins being mindless violent beings.This game is worth playing, I may even play through again some time.

With tactical slow-motion possibilities, like, choosing your attacks, blocking, using skills, etc. It's an interesting concept and if you liked the Styx game, you should check this one game for the story.

By today's standards the textures/graphics are pretty poor and quite a bit of the voice acting leaves a lot to be desired but in the end the game won me over.I enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters and liked the challenging combat system that reminded me of KOTOR.  The story was prety basic and usually on rails but sometimes I don't want an open world as those can tend to be exhausting.If its on sale definitely give it a go for an alternative take on the regular fantasy genre.

												Overall, I think this game is worth playing, more for the story than the gameplay. If you're no huge orc fan (I'm not) grab it on a sale at £10 (50%) or so, if you're an orc lover, the full £20 is probably worth it to you.Good:Story is pretty good and well told, even though it's not particularly original.The main characters and more important side characters are well voiced.The graphics in the environment are good, the main characters are very good (Aside some nasty clipping on cloth)It's relatively long for a linear game, I didn't mess around too much and ended up clocking about 13 hours (Including deaths and retries, probably 10 hours)The main characters themselves are very good. They interact frequently, they have a pretty well told backstory and a few surprises to discover later in the game. There are a good few funny moments too. (Of the dark humour kind) The way shopping works is pretty neat. Instead of cash, anything you own has a certain value in barter points (Very few, like, 3 or 4 for a good chest piece) and each thing can be upgraded a single time. You can sell for the points and keep them like you would cash, but you won't earn any. (you can find a few in chests through the game)The music isn't particularly energetic or ringtone-memorable, but it fits the situation very well the entire time. Personally I liked it a lot.Neutral:The game is very linear. You get some choices here and there but they don't make all that much difference. There are some decent sidequests.The rpg elements are ok, but you'll end up just dumping most of the points into 2 stats for each character and using two or three skills on each. You get to upgrade each skill once, with 2 choices for each, which is decent.Bad:The combat seems like a good idea but ends up being pretty boring and annoyingly difficult. I ended up dropping it to easy at about the halfway point because it just became boring and you die ridiculously easily, though it has to be said it can feel rather cool to have ark tank everyone while styx deals with the rest one by one in order of threat. (tip, take out the rangers first, they won't target ark often, they stay out of range of his taunt)The stealth mechanics are too easily foiled by dogs simply detecting you, and at other times you can kill enemies who literally look around in your direction, but don't see you unless they move to completely face you.The general enemies and less important characters look pretty bad. Humans particularly.			"

												Overall, I have to say that this was a really good game, despite my contempt for the combat system. Pro's:- Storyline is well done- Good voiceovers (I'm usually not a huge fan of profanity as it shows a lack of creativity but the way it was done completely fit the context)- Great graphics with immersive environments- Good skill customization where decisions can make a pretty big difference but also fit differing playstyles- Awesome soundtrack, very fitting to the atmosphere and environments- Likable characters that are easy to connect withCon's:- Horrible combat system for an action based game (similar to Dragon Age Origins)     <disclaimer> I completely understand I am a bit bias in this regard but I really don't care for this type of combat system and believe it really held this game back from being excellent- Itemization lacks depth, not a whole lot in the way of gear and weaponsIn the end, I would definitely recommend this game, especially as it's usually on sale for under $10 and undoubtedly a worthy value for roughly 25 hours of entertainment (1 time through on medium settings). Even though I am not a fan of the combat system whatsoever, I still own Styx and am excited to delve into that game simply for the positive reasons mentioned above.			"

												I am so glad that I didn't let the negative reviews or complaints about the combat scare me away from playing this game. I absolutely love it! The combat really isn't as bad as they make it out to be. It certainly is something you have to get a bit used to, but once you get the hang of it rather quickly. The combat system seems necessary for being in control of both characters at once without making it turn-based. The characters are amazing, the story is fun, and the game itself can be a bit challenging (but not enough to make you want to quit). My only problem was that I couldn't get the controller to work for this game, but after playing it I realized it would be much better to play with a mouse and keyboard anyway. In conclusion, I fell in love with this game and I think that if you give it a fair shot you will to!			"

												Highly recommended Action-RPG, in total 8.5/10. At the beginning, it needed some time to get used to the combat and the extremely linear levels, at that time I would have given it a 6/10, but it grew fast on me, and had its peak around 2nd and 3rd chapter, there the game was 9/10. The graphics is quite good (only the terrain is quite bland), especially the faces of the orcs and the main chars are very well done. What makes this game unique, are the cool chars, one a Berserker orc (he gets into Berserc mode where you cant control him anymore if hit too often, but then dishes out insane amount of dmg), and a stealth assassin goblin... You often need to sneak in Stealth mode and assassinate a few mobs before doing the real battle. Game is quite nicely challenging on normal.Also, the story and the athmosphere is great, quite something special. After a short while, I really liked the combat system (you can slow it to almost slow mo and give commands), hoping for a true sequal with both chars!			"

												Excellent.  What I hoped out of this title was exactly what I got.Pro:- Story- Music (Kind of like Apocalyptica's Master of Puppets cover)- VisualsCon:- Combat- Odd Lipsync and some strange character acting- Choices?  In a linear rpg?  Whatever gets me more EXP and lootDetails:The story is the number one reason to check this game out.  Like it says, the game is told through the perspective of the orcs.  While they are shown to be victims in the war the orcs are far from peace loving nature folk.  Humanity has broken a lot of the orcs but they are still a threat.  As many have said, Styx steals the show with his dark humor and interesting past.  There is an unnaturally large amount of swearing that feels very offputting.  Hearing an honorable orc discuss his nature themed religon only to drop the F-bomb midsentence is pretty jarring.Opposite of the great story is the rough combat.  By the end of the game combat will come easy (although if you're like me you'll have to drop the difficulty a notch for a few major battles).  With some work I think this could have gone over easier for players.Combat:I figured it out around the time where you ""challenge"" Fox.  Both characters have three ""stances"".  Red (left) for all offense and little defense.  Green (middle) for utilities like steath and throwing Styx.  Blue (right) for defending and range.  As you level up you can put skill points into new attacks from the three stances as well as upgrade them once (choose wisely!).  Typically for me I used Ark's roar that provokes the crowd to him (getting them off of Styx) followed up with his defense buff and then a series of arcing swipes (since he is taking on the group).  Styx buffs his knives with poison, then throws an amber bomb, followed up with his area of effect knife throw.  That is the beauty of this system is that you can set up a series of attacks for one character and then switch to the other to create another form of punishment.  During the late, late battles I had Styx target the pesky range and weaken enemies while Ark took on the rain of blows from the crowd.  Long and the short, if you can look past the indie roughness of certain elements and stick with the combat you will have a great time.  Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to start installing Styx: Master of Shadows.			"

												Of Orcs and Men, a simple game that received a lot of very bad reviews. People complained about the combat, about the graphics, about everything. To be honest, I got it for cheap and decied to try it. If you can look behind the game, which is not THAT bad as people claim, you have a solid fun and simple backstory, a good unscrolling of events and for me, one of the best Goblins ever to grace a computer game: STYX. Honestly, for 7$ this game is worth it just to play with Styx and hear his foul-mouthed remarks and puerile retorts. Ark is good, but a bit high and mighty and Warrior Code orc, but Styx is just fun. The combat system is ok and honestly, I just played the game to keep the story going, which entertained me even into the end, with the classic twists and betrayals common to fantasy literature portrayed in the game. Give it a spin while its cheap, or wait for it to come on sale again. I spent 2 days finishing it and gladly enjoyed every minute of it.  As a tip make Styx go full Ranged and Ark full Offensive. Combat is a series of actions you spam over and over and can lead to a lot of broken spines and Ark killing Styx when he is in Berzerk mode XD. Invest early in Rez companion skills and just hack away with abandon as the story unfolds, finished in 12 hours in easy mode because all i wanted was to cruise the content and enjoy the Cinematics. Reached level 21 by the end. In retrospective all the skills I used were Styx Aoe Stun Bomb and Arks AOE swings over and over. Gear is kinda sparse so don´t sweat it too much, just upgrade your armor. All in all I would gladly buy part 2 if they ever release it. I  am a  fan of Styx and goblins in general, wish I had a Styx action figure too! Cheers!			"

												Join Arkail & Styx, a pair of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, as they get ♥♥♥♥ done and try not to kill each other on the way. As you get to ""know"" them, you'll probably end up loving the two jerks as I did, they're kind of like a fantasy Kane & Lynch. If you're not totally gravy with a LOT of swearing, don't get this game. The script writer(s) use the F word like they got a job lot of it on sale and are trying to use it all up before it goes out of style.I read the other reviews complaints about the combat and they're right. The combat is very odd and at first really throws you off, and I will say that I started off hating it.  but after I decided this was more like a Telltale Game story focused game than the type of RPG game I'm used to, I actually ended up enjoying the combat, especially the stealth aspects. In fact, I ended up stealthing the majority of the combat and it was very satisfying, there's puzzle solving elements to it and having patience and observing patterns really pays off. You can actually hotkey your favorite moves for each character and avoid going into slow-motion tactical mode and that makes the combat feel a bit snappier. Although honestly, I ended up really likeing the combat because it gave me some thinking space to switch tactics up on the fly.The game does have some bugs and technical flaws, but made up for it overwhelmingly with the story, voice acting & overall experience. I enjoyed the heck out of it, and will probably play through it again to make some different choices. I only wish the further adventures of these two douchcanoes would hurry up and be available as I want to follow them around some more. I'll be buying the Styx games after I finish typing this review just to hang out with him a bit more.			"

												It has a good feel to it. I don't know how well it may have stood up at the time on release, but it hints at options and a branching story, giving your a few options to keep the story stong and yourself interested. Combat was challenging enough, stealth was basic but then you whip out the big guy and let carnage rip. I would say that the level design wasn't brilliant, a few nooks and crannies that you seemd to get stuck in and rough edges to the tunnels and streets you run down. Its lacking in scope and execution to be a masterpiece but I did enjoy my time playing it and satisfied on completion.			"

												When I was playing, I had feeling that contet was severe cut from the very beggining. The game is like Dragon Age (the first one), but more clunky and cheaper version of it.Characters, races and worldOrcs: big greenskins who apperad to be beaten by 2 time size smaller people (also thay looks like super mutants from fallout 3 and new vegas:DDD )... really? Every ♥♥♥♥ing orc had arm much bigger than any human on the world and its natural for them! They should snap human neck like a match.  Also they sounds like they are very intelligent, only thing what they lack is foken top hat and monocle. ♥♥♥♥♥ losers and nothing more.Arkail: a big orcish body builder who apperently has some anger managment issues, which most of the time led him to beat his ♥♥♥ down.Styx: your main dps, a cynical goblin who can talk a lot and swearing too, reminds me that lannister dwarf from GOT., apperently also has a lot of common sense and humourFew other side characters tat doesnt bring much to the main story.Shame that you only have 2 playable characters, Arkance would be a great addition to the gameplay....World of OOAM: good idea teaming up orc and goblin, it was very fun to watching and listening how they interact with each other. Quite good main story with few side quests but the game is stll very short. You can beat the game in less than 20 hours. I beat game on medium difficulty, like most of the games that i finished, not too hard and too easy (im not masochist who wants to beat every game on hardest difficulty, i like to enjoy the game not to be mad whole time playing it).Game mechanics: like in dragon age but simplified version, easy to finish game on the keyboard contoller, dunno why people complaining about it.Music: Composed by Olivier Derivière, performed by the Boston Cello Quartet... its magic! you can taste a bit of it  Of Orcs and Men OST ""My quest begins"" EXTENDED  Cant hate this game, has a big potential for sequel.I reccomend palying this game for everyone and with no doubts i can give this game 6.5/10			"

												I was expecting a bit more of this game, especially story wise, but it wasn't disappointing.The combat system was fun enough, but nothing out of the ordinary. Once I got to know the basics of combat, I found the the game very easy to beat by selecting Normal difficulty. If you want a challenge, I would slide it to Hard or Very Hard. You can always change back the difficulty mid-game if you think it's too much.Especially if you do use Hard mode, there may be a problem: the cut scenes are nice, but they will play again if you die, as you can't save during combat. This means that if you have to repeat some combats, you will have to skip through a crapload of cutscenes to get back to the combat again - I am not exaggerating. This is the biggest flaw in the game.Replayability is relatively poor. Overall, I did like the game, and I really like the fantasy world the developpers presented us. I played Styx: Master of Shadows before I went for Of Orcs And Men, and I simply love the goblin Styx, and all his genesis. Arkail was a nice character to follow as well. It tasted good, but in the end I thought it could have been more, and better.Recommended on sale.			"

Pros+ Looks pretty good for a 2012 game+ Runs smoothly (good port)+ Controller or Mouse/Keyboard work+ Some interesting plot twists+ Interesting premise + Voice acting for Styx and Arkail is strong+ Length feels about right+ Rage mechanic is different and something new to meNegatives - Repetitive combat- Combat is unintersting - on higher difficulty levels you use the same conition abilities over and over hoping for stuns etc- Few Gear/Item choices and feels like an after thought (i wore one set of armour on Arkail from chapter 1 until completion)- Camera angle/control is terrible- Overuse of the same faces on NPC after NPC- At time of writing £19.99 is a little on the expensive side- Arkails constant roaring and styx giggle in every cut scene.....

												Finally. A story of an orc, a real anti-hero, a relatable hero. It's refreshing to see a change of story telling; breaking the sterotype of orcs being mindless brutes. Besides this game the only way I have found story for Orcs is DnD. This game isn't perfect but I loved the hell out of it and I want more			"

												Bought it this morning, finished just now, and I gotta say I had a BLAST playing this!The art-style, the scenery the atmosphere, voice acting and the story itself were PERFECT!The combat system had a few kinks and exploits, but nothing gamebreaking, and not so horrible that it makes the game unbearable.If you got the money and its on sale, grab it. Hell grab it even when its not on sale, if you dont like the combat just push through for the story, the dialogue is amazing.A big 9/10 because of the combat system, else it would've been a 10/10.

												I just beat this game mere moments ago and i have never loved a story so much. If your willing to put up with the bad faces of male humans, the poor lip syncing, and the excesive language; you've got a fanatsic story, great graphics (2012), lovable characters, awesome combat systems, and an addiction. (I have never had to tell myself ""you need to stop, it's been too long"" till now.) If I look at this game realistically it's probably an 8/10. But if I look at this game with how much enjoyment I got out of it its a 9.5/10. So whatever you do; don't listen to the negative reviews from the people who only played this game for 45 minutes and judged it too quickly. They dont know what they're talking about. This game is fantastic. Don't let them fool you.Over use of the F bomb/10			"

												This game could have been much better.At first I was excited at the sights of a game which focused on the Greenskins as the protagonists rather than the usual bad guys, but after having played through the game I'm kinda stuck in the middle.The game is really story-driven because other than the story it doesn't really perform well on other aspects. Gameplay is very linear aside from a few optional side-quests which really do not matter most of the time. Choices don't really have an impact on the story and parts of the level design would make one wonder why it's even there in the first place. The graphics are alright at best but the combat leaves much to be desired - targeting can be a pain at times and the reset of skills on an enemy's death is rather annoying to say the least.If it wasn't for my love for the Greenskins, I probably wouldn't have bothered with this. The story in itself (which is supposed to be it's strong part) was rather plain and predictable. If anything I would say the best part of this game is it's amazing soundtrack. If I didn't know any better I'd say the combat music is what has driven me to finish the game.All in all.. I guess it can be considered enjoyable if you're really into Greenskins like me. Otherwise I wouldn't bother.. Glad to have picked it up on a sale because it's not worth the full retail price.			"

												This game has two modes.  Childishly easy... to red eye frustration.  Funny thing is no matter what difficulty you pick you will still hit both of these things in the game.  The story is good, the atmosphere is good, the characters are a little two dimensional but decently flushed out, the game play is and control is decent, level design is very march down the hallway style but whatever.  I just can get over the bad design of some of the encounters.  There really isn't a stratagy other than hope the RNG is with you this time.			"

												Of Orcs and Men is a game with some interesting ideas but ultimatly fails in a whole lot more areas than it actually succeeds, which seems to be a common theme with this developer as I'm playing through their games... Anyways let's get to it shall we? Combat I've had to rewrite this section actually because originally I had a big rant about the combat here but it took way too many characters and didn't leave much room for the other stuff in this review, you can still  read it if you're interested though [pastebin.com], anyways here's the short and to the point versionThe combat is pretty bad, and playing on harder difficulties only makes it worse, you control 2 characters, a big warrior orc and a small rogue goblin, they both have unique abilites that you select from a weird wheel which slows time when it pops up as you press the space key, suffice to say it's quite clunky because the game doesn't know if it wants to be turn based or real time and it's just this really weird ""strategic"" combat as a resultIt's a very clunky system that feels unpolished, you can't dodge / block damage in a straightforward way, it's all up to some stats and RNG, same for your enemies blocking / countering / dodging and the stupid rage mechanic for your big orc character (I go into more detail about that on the longer version) and you're always overwhelmed in numbers which limit a lot your options since only a few skills can be upgraded to be uninterruptable because the enemies interrupt most of your other attacks by hitting youA lot of encounters devolved into me using the goblin character running around in circles to avoid enemies to revive the big orc, getting 1-2 hits with him, dying and getting revived again over and over again until everyone was dead, sometimes they got hits on the goblin aswell and if he died it got even worse by the two characters reviving each other all the time and barely getting any hits in to kill the enemies, but you have to play as only 1 character in some sections which can make things even more frustratingYou can also use stealth to 1 hit K.O dudes with your goblin before you get spotted and it's a very useful way of thinning the enemies ranks before you inevitably have to face them in ""real"" combat, but there are a lot of fights triggered by cutscenes or with enemy placement which you can't stealth your way out of so there's that  Exploration So yeah, safe to say I'm not really happy with the combat at all, it's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t a lot of times and I haven't been frustrated like this with a game in a long time, the real kicker is that you know what you do for like 90% of the whole game? Just go through straight corridors walking very slowly as a big fat orc (or a small goblin) until you get into slightly bigger rooms with a bunch of dudes in them, kill them all, go through another corridor, get to another slightly bigger room, rinse and repeat until you get to the objective at the end of the map, for the whole game, it seriously takes its toll upon you and the first time I played this game was for around 1-2 hours, but I really thought I've been playing for the whole day, serisouly it felt like an eternity, this game's combat really grinds upon your very soul and the only real exploration is that there's maybe a slightly shorter branching corridor which leads to another big room with lots of dudes in it and some loot, or you get a sidequest from an NPC in one of the hub areas and you go through the exact same formula of going through corridors and then big rooms again Story The story while it may seem interesting at times, but it's pretty meh, there's nothing really all that special about it, I think the main thing here is that it's different in a way not many other games explore because you play as Orcs and Goblins which usually are the evil bad guys and all that, but yeah this time around the humans are evil and conquered almost all the orcs and enslaved them, you're in control of an orc named Arkail, a strong elite warrior which is part of the Bloodjaws clan on a crazy suicide mission to kill the human emperor and hopefully make things better for his kin, and also Styx, a goblin rogue type character helping him along the wayThe voice acting is a mixed bag as usual with this developer and the same can be said about the characters, some can be pretty likeable like Styx which is probably one of the reasons he's got his own game which maybe I'll try at some point and then there are your generic villains or the twist which you could see from a mile away near the endBut ultimatly the story is just that, it has a nice / different coat of paint with it's setting, I'll have to admit that's what kept me going but it's pretty average and I didn't feel any real sense of satisfaction after completing it (aside from being free from the horrifying combat maybe) and at no point I really felt invested or cared for any of the characters, the only real fun one is Styx to be quite honest, the others vary on the spectrum from fine to stereotypical trope ""x"" or ""y"" characterYou have some choices but few actually matter, a lot of it it the same whatever you choose with some differences only being like a line of dialogue, the bigger changes / minor consequences are a result of sidequests if you wish to go for those Conclusion All in all I'd have to say that while it's different it's a pretty mediocre game, you're doing the same thing for pretty much all of it i.e the ""Exploration"" section from this review and sadly that same thing is just not all that fun to do, maybe the story might intrigue you in some way but I wouldn't hold by breath on it, it's sad to say this because this game did have some cool potential but it just didn't come to fruition, honestly don't bother with this one, but if you REALLY want to give it a go for whatever reason at least do yoruself a favor and wait to pick it up on sale			"

												Eh, it's ok.  Not great, but maybe see if you can get it on sale for cheap.This is an adventure RPG.  You follow a linear set path, deal with enemies a few at a time, find some hidden treasures, change and upgrade your armor and weapons, and gain experience points from combat to level up your skills.  The world is a ""fantasy"" setting where the humans have come together and formed an empire after a long war against the Orcs.  Now the emperor is running a campaign of genocide against anything with green skin.  The dwarves and elves have joined him, mostly out of fear for their own people.In this game, you play as two characters.  You can switch control from one to the other on the fly, but whichever one you are NOT controlling will be active with AI control.  The AI is stupid as a bag of rocks, by the way.  The big orc is loud and likes to hit people in the face.  He has a mission:  to save his species from genocide by assassinating the human emperor.  The little goblin is tasked with helping the orc get through the city so he can do the deed.  The little goblin is very sneaky; if he enters stealth mode then the big guy will stop following you and wait until you exit stealth mode before he runs to catch up.  While in stealth mode, many times you can make a fight easier - or avoid a fight completely - by sneaking behind the enemy and assassinating them one at a time.  If a fight does break out because you are witnessed killing a soldier, then you will be alternating control between the two.  You can set a chain of commands for each of them, but they can only remember four commands at once.  Each character has his own upgrade tree, for which you gain points when you level-up.  There is one area that has SHARED commands for both of them, and each character has two fighting styles to upgrade.  The goblin has a path for ranged attacks (dagger toss) and another path for up-close fighting.  The orc has a path for strong but slow attacks, and another for attacks that allow him to also block or parry incoming blows.The graphics are pretty well done.  The music isn't awful, but also not great.  The story is interesting because it is rare that you get to play as a ""bad guy"" but still have it feel like you're doing the right thing.  The combat, in my opinion, is pretty terrible though.  And the path you are allowed to follow is extremely limited.  That does detract from the fun story aspects a bit, so I only give this one a rating of ""Eh, it's ok"" whereas if the combat system had been done a little better I might actually call it a good game.Story:  good stuff.Combat:  terrible, though the stealth assassination style is amusing for a little while.Still worth playing?  Sure, if you can get it for just a few bucks.  Don't shell out big money for this one though.If you try this one and enjoy it, consider another game in the series:  ""Styx: Master of Shadows"" which as of writing this I still have not played.

												First let me pre-face Spider Studios is not some huge company with a million dollar budget for every video game they makeThat said I gave this game a solid 8/10I had a lot of trouble figuring out the combat system, and how to make Styx and Arkail work together, but that was only because it was actually a pretty unique fighting system, and unlike modern games every battle isn't super easy.Instead the game is actually challenging so in combat you actually have to think and work for your victory and not just spam click for satisfaction. The story: It was so dark and interesting. At first it seemed stereotypical and storybookish, but as it develops the characters become very flushed out and you have a very dark and grim world painted before you, as you are given a deeper understanding of the characters and their personal struggles, but also the significance of your quest in this gameThe graphics are pretty good, especially for when this was made!You'll have an interesting time playing around with styx and arkail as you customize both to compliment one another(otherwise you probably won't be able to beat the game lol) It had one REALLY contorversial scene(monastery part) where I, who am usually silent while playing video games, audibly shouted ""WHAT THE F***?!""Look past that scene and its an amazing game worth getting!

												There are good, bad and great things about this game.The bad is the control system (in my opinion) and it's straight forward levels. It takes a bit of time to get used to the control system but once u know it, it is pretty intuitive. The good is the graphics and the richness of the world. It truly gives u the feeling there is something out there.The great is the ""green"". :D I believe it is a great idea to have a game based on Orcs. U can not expect this to be warhammer or world of warcraft (or any other fantasy game), but it is still extremelly amazing. The characters, the plot, the backstories (how things, seemingly unrelated come up later in the game), styx, etc.Over all when I started the game I thought the lack of openness was going to spoil the game, but it's richness and story came as a great surprise. It was like watching a movie :)			"

												Took about 15 hours to beat on Medium, I recommend this game. Good humor, good game (it seems they may have had a bit of a budget issue but it doesn't show much), and the gameplay is good. As others have mentioned here the combat involves picking different moves from a skill wheel, with no cool downs (some of Styx's moves require Concentration though). Styx Master of Shadows is a prequel to this game, which I also recommend. As for order of playing them I think either one could be played first, I don't think anything would be spoiled playing one before the other.Overall it feels unique, and I may play it again sometime to pick different dialogue options or try different builds.

""Yeah, it's not easy bein' a greenskin on this ♥♥♥♥ing continent..."" You're still the good guy.

With its dark world and characters that seem very human despite their fantastical genus, there should be few people who won't feel satisfied by the plot, as it grows from a story of foolhardy revenge to inspiring rebellion. Pro's!+ Beautiful Soundtrack+ Great Storyline with its twists and turns (although somewhat predictable at times)+ The ability to switch between characters easily, and play to both their strengths or weaknesses+ Honest foul language, no censorship here! Along with a good laugh.+ Stragetic Skill tree (work your characters together, or go for the sole OP skills)+ Was given a prequel due to its success+ More than one way to go about missions/storyline (sneaky way or full on bash mode)Con's!- The battle system can feel sluggish- Linear Path throughout the story- Awkwardly animated and poorly voiced non-main characters "

A lore rich world with a very beleivable story if you follow history.The game gives you the option to be a brash and blood thirtsy as you please, or stealthy and calculated if that is your aim. A unique skill tree that taylors to your playstyle and rewards you with sidequests. At no time will you feel like someone is giving an exposition dump.

												What you're in for is an RPG with more or less rudimentary character development, for most of the game, somewhat shallow characters, way too few items to justify the fuss they make about upgrading, really bad menus and rather unsatisfying combat.The levels are linear, mostly, and with few options. The guards are often placed in a manner that you can almost see the numbers above their heads telling you the order in which to kill them.The difficulty is a rollercoaster, most of the times, you can mash through, and in between you will get encounters that are next to impossible and often only work because of bugs, like the bad pathfinding, or cheesing the AI.But in the end, if you get it cheap, it's an okay RPG in a setting that should be expanded and hopefully gets, in the following games, that will set you up for the Styx games, and will entertain you. It's got some nicer and some less nice environments, some more and some less logical plot parts, and at least the character development lets you set a bit of a direction and play style. The final stage is too short for characters to really get fleshed out, should have had a bit more to do there, the autosave is sometimes weird and there are too many sequences directly leading into harder fights, but overall, it's a 65/100 (on a real scale, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""85+ means it's an okay game"" scale for kids and marketing)			"

												Suprisingly good! i picked this up cheap on a sale. it starts off a bit slow, Being for years old the cinematics are very dated and as are the graphics in places. After the first half hour however it shows its true colours. Really interesting two chracter combat mechanics, whith just enough RPG for me to feel i could style my warriors the way i wanted. The story wont win awards but the protagonists are solid and likable, and the villain is interesting enough. Felt a little rushed towards the end, and some horrible checkpoints in the last chapter, making you re-watch loads of dialogue before attmpting te same battle.7/10 - really enjoyable but could have done with a little more TLC			"

												Very good game. Disregard the time played on Steam. I played it through on Xbox 360 last year and liked it a lot. Good concept, good dialogues, good music and voice acting, good story and of course good battles with a pause button more or less like it was in the first Witcher. I definitely recommend it, especially for such price. Just don’t expect too much from it, it’s not an AAA+ project, it is not complex like many other similar games, the maps are small and progression is quite linear, but it is still a good solid game.

												TL;DR - Buy it. fun, challenging combat, good story, has replay value. Definitely worth the money.I'll begin with a simple statement: This game is excellent. It has a good storyline, fun and challenging combat, a variety of player choices, a great looking world and so much more. I think it's worth mentioning i'm a huge Dragon Age fan and this game reminded me so much of it while still providing me a new, fun experience. The combat is very similar to DA which I enjoyed and was challenging but not hard, so you could always win the hardest of fights (playing on normal difficulty) after a few tries and after switching up your strategies. The graphics are okay but nothing special at all. The story is fun, following the journey of Arkail, an orc who must kill the emperor to free his people from oppression and slavery, and Styx, a mischievous goblin hired to escort Arkail to the Emperor's front door. The characters are also fun, with you getting to learn about their past and especially Styx's origins, while watching their friendship grow. The only complaints I have are about the dialogue and boss battles. The dialogue wasn't excellent, with all the characters swearing way too much and where it was completely out of place, as well as voices (I didn't expect Styx to sound the way he does at all). The boss battles were good, but IMO should've been harder, there were some fights during the game that I found significantly harder than the final battle, and they didn't give me the feeling of satisfaction I would've liked. Also the game has an expansive lore, which is unfortunately only touched on, only talked about in a select few lines of dialogue, and with no codex or journal to tell you about the lore of the land. But with only a couple of problems I would definitely recommend you buy this game, don't even wait until it's on sale, just buy it. It has replay value and for the 14 hours it took me to complete 1 playthrough, it felt like about 5 hours. I hope this was helpful.			"

Just go through straight corridors walking very slowly as a big fat orc (or a small goblin) until you get into slightly bigger rooms with a bunch of dudes in them, kill them all, go through another corridor, get to another slightly bigger room, rinse and repeat until you get to the objective at the end of the map, for the whole game, it seriously takes its toll upon you and the first time I played this game was for around 1-2 hours, but I really thought I've been playing for the whole day, serisouly it felt like an eternity, this game's combat really grinds upon your very soul and the only real exploration is that there's maybe a slightly shorter branching corridor which leads to another big room with lots of dudes in it and some loot, or you get a sidequest from an NPC in one of the hub areas and you go through the exact same formula of going through corridors and then big rooms again Story The story while it may seem interesting at times, but it's pretty meh, there's nothing really all that special about it, I think the main thing here is that it's different in a way not many other games explore because you play as Orcs and Goblins which usually are the evil bad guys and all that, but yeah this time around the humans are evil and conquered almost all the orcs and enslaved them, you're in control of an orc named Arkail, a strong elite warrior which is part of the Bloodjaws clan on a crazy suicide mission to kill the human emperor and hopefully make things better for his kin, and also Styx, a goblin rogue type character helping him along the wayThe voice acting is a mixed bag as usual with this developer and the same can be said about the characters, some can be pretty likeable like Styx which is probably one of the reasons he's got his own game which maybe I'll try at some point and then there are your generic villains or the twist which you could see from a mile away near the endBut ultimatly the story is just that, it has a nice / different coat of paint with it's setting, I'll have to admit that's what kept me going but it's pretty average and I didn't feel any real sense of satisfaction after completing it (aside from being free from the horrifying combat maybe) and at no point I really felt invested or cared for any of the characters, the only real fun one is Styx to be quite honest, the others vary on the spectrum from fine to stereotypical trope ""x"" or ""y"" characterYou have some choices but few actually matter, a lot of it it the same whatever you choose with some differences only being like a line of dialogue, the bigger changes / minor consequences are a result of sidequests if you wish to go for those Conclusion All in all I'd have to say that while it's different it's a pretty mediocre game, you're doing the same thing for pretty much all of it i.e the ""Exploration"" section from this review and sadly that same thing is just not all that fun to do, maybe the story might intrigue you in some way but I wouldn't hold by breath on it, it's sad to say this because this game did have some cool potential but it just didn't come to fruition, honestly don't bother with this one, but if you REALLY want to give it a go for whatever reason at least do yoruself a favor and wait to pick it up on sale			"

												This game has two modes.  Childishly easy... to red eye frustration.  Funny thing is no matter what difficulty you pick you will still hit both of these things in the game.  The story is good, the atmosphere is good, the characters are a little two dimensional but decently flushed out, the game play is and control is decent, level design is very march down the hallway style but whatever.  I just can get over the bad design of some of the encounters.  There really isn't a stratagy other than hope the RNG is with you this time.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. I will admit the first 10 to 15 minutes the combat felt really awkward but you get used to it. There's a bit of strategy to it, which I enjoyed. Overall though the story and characters were a main draw for me. When I completed the game I was tempted to play through it again (it's not too long).			"

												This game could have been much better.At first I was excited at the sights of a game which focused on the Greenskins as the protagonists rather than the usual bad guys, but after having played through the game I'm kinda stuck in the middle.The game is really story-driven because other than the story it doesn't really perform well on other aspects. Gameplay is very linear aside from a few optional side-quests which really do not matter most of the time. Choices don't really have an impact on the story and parts of the level design would make one wonder why it's even there in the first place. The graphics are alright at best but the combat leaves much to be desired - targeting can be a pain at times and the reset of skills on an enemy's death is rather annoying to say the least.If it wasn't for my love for the Greenskins, I probably wouldn't have bothered with this. The story in itself (which is supposed to be it's strong part) was rather plain and predictable. If anything I would say the best part of this game is it's amazing soundtrack. If I didn't know any better I'd say the combat music is what has driven me to finish the game.All in all.. I guess it can be considered enjoyable if you're really into Greenskins like me. Otherwise I wouldn't bother.. Glad to have picked it up on a sale because it's not worth the full retail price.			"

												I just beat this game mere moments ago and i have never loved a story so much. If your willing to put up with the bad faces of male humans, the poor lip syncing, and the excesive language; you've got a fanatsic story, great graphics (2012), lovable characters, awesome combat systems, and an addiction. (I have never had to tell myself ""you need to stop, it's been too long"" till now.) If I look at this game realistically it's probably an 8/10. But if I look at this game with how much enjoyment I got out of it its a 9.5/10. So whatever you do; don't listen to the negative reviews from the people who only played this game for 45 minutes and judged it too quickly. They dont know what they're talking about. This game is fantastic. Don't let them fool you.Over use of the F bomb/10			"

												The Good:nice enough graphics, pretty easy controls and some cool skills.Going stealth mode with styx and picking of enemies one-by-one,or turning enemies to mush with Arkaïl the orc is pretty fun.The Bad:Linear story without any surprises, VERY linear level design.The Ugly:Unskibable cut-scenes, and multi-instance battles with cut-scenes in-between and unable to save.All in all a decent game, not bad as such, but not great either.Recommendation: Buy it on sale.

												Pros:-First game I've seen that tellls you flat out ""Going berserk is the worst tactical solution you could make"".-You may be wondering what place a goblin has in a game called 'Of Orcs And Men'? Well I did too, and the game gave a more than satisfying answer.-'Throw the halfling goblin' at its finest.-One of those precious few games that show you the world through the bloodthirsty, mindless, slaughter-happy monster's point of view.-Tactics. If you think you can win this game using default attacks and/or using one character as if this was a 3rd persong hack-and slash game, then you're gonna have a bad time.-Interesting fights and choices of attacks.Cons:-Equipment doesn't scale up with difficulty. I finished the game using some of the equipment from the first chapter, and I had more trade-points (money) then I could find a use for.-Repititive hand gestures (not that kind).-Stealth system is extremely primitive\simplistic. You can walk in front of enemies in broad daylight and they wouldn't notice you. As a stealth game enthusiast, that just felt so wrong for me.			"

												An epic adventure with a most unusual duo of protagonists. While most fantasy games put orcs and goblins in the role of mindless vermin or lesser opponents, OOAM makes them persecuted indigenous folk, sort of like native americans kind of thing, with men being the conquistadors. Arkail, a berserking orc, and Styx, a stealthy goblin, set out to do the unthinkable - kill the emperor. Through their journey they will be accompanied by a very climatic and tension building soundtrack, and a not-so-tension-building combat system, but i guess that's often the case with strategic combat. If you can overlook minor gameplay issues and appreciate a good plot, this game is for you.			"

												Combat in this game is awful.  Every attack requires a overly long and stilted animation in order to be completed, however every basic enemy attack will interupt your animation and either cause the attack to not be completed OR your characters will be stun locked by several attacks happening in successive order.What passes for healing in this game also requires the overly long animations that result in a net loss of health by the time they are complete so as to render the healing worthless.  Sure you can heal for 50 odd HP but by the time its over you have been beaten on by all your oppenents for 75 worth HP so you have achieved nothing.Every enemy can and will resist your stuns and if you manage to pull one off it lasts for all of half a second meanwhile every other enemy can stun you and those lasts for 3-4 seconds.  3 or 4 seconds of you getting your feces pushed in by overwhelming odds.The final boss is preempted by several minutes of unskippable cut scenes, a couple of tedious fights, more unskippable cutscenes and then finally facing off with him.  Him of the constantly ressing adds and un-interuptable (because he resists 90% of stuns if you can even manage to pull one off with the animations being interupted by the adds mind you) mega heals for himself.  So you die and have to go through the 10 minutes of BS to die to him again.			"

												Eh, it's ok.  Not great, but maybe see if you can get it on sale for cheap.This is an adventure RPG.  You follow a linear set path, deal with enemies a few at a time, find some hidden treasures, change and upgrade your armor and weapons, and gain experience points from combat to level up your skills.  The world is a ""fantasy"" setting where the humans have come together and formed an empire after a long war against the Orcs.  Now the emperor is running a campaign of genocide against anything with green skin.  The dwarves and elves have joined him, mostly out of fear for their own people.In this game, you play as two characters.  You can switch control from one to the other on the fly, but whichever one you are NOT controlling will be active with AI control.  The AI is stupid as a bag of rocks, by the way.  The big orc is loud and likes to hit people in the face.  He has a mission:  to save his species from genocide by assassinating the human emperor.  The little goblin is tasked with helping the orc get through the city so he can do the deed.  The little goblin is very sneaky; if he enters stealth mode then the big guy will stop following you and wait until you exit stealth mode before he runs to catch up.  While in stealth mode, many times you can make a fight easier - or avoid a fight completely - by sneaking behind the enemy and assassinating them one at a time.  If a fight does break out because you are witnessed killing a soldier, then you will be alternating control between the two.  You can set a chain of commands for each of them, but they can only remember four commands at once.  Each character has his own upgrade tree, for which you gain points when you level-up.  There is one area that has SHARED commands for both of them, and each character has two fighting styles to upgrade.  The goblin has a path for ranged attacks (dagger toss) and another path for up-close fighting.  The orc has a path for strong but slow attacks, and another for attacks that allow him to also block or parry incoming blows.The graphics are pretty well done.  The music isn't awful, but also not great.  The story is interesting because it is rare that you get to play as a ""bad guy"" but still have it feel like you're doing the right thing.  The combat, in my opinion, is pretty terrible though.  And the path you are allowed to follow is extremely limited.  That does detract from the fun story aspects a bit, so I only give this one a rating of ""Eh, it's ok"" whereas if the combat system had been done a little better I might actually call it a good game.Story:  good stuff.Combat:  terrible, though the stealth assassination style is amusing for a little while.Still worth playing?  Sure, if you can get it for just a few bucks.  Don't shell out big money for this one though.If you try this one and enjoy it, consider another game in the series:  ""Styx: Master of Shadows"" which as of writing this I still have not played.

												When I was playing, I had feeling that contet was severe cut from the very beggining. The game is like Dragon Age (the first one), but more clunky and cheaper version of it.Characters, races and worldOrcs: big greenskins who apperad to be beaten by 2 time size smaller people (also thay looks like super mutants from fallout 3 and new vegas:DDD )... really? Every ♥♥♥♥ing orc had arm much bigger than any human on the world and its natural for them! They should snap human neck like a match.  Also they sounds like they are very intelligent, only thing what they lack is foken top hat and monocle. ♥♥♥♥♥ losers and nothing more.Arkail: a big orcish body builder who apperently has some anger managment issues, which most of the time led him to beat his ♥♥♥ down.Styx: your main dps, a cynical goblin who can talk a lot and swearing too, reminds me that lannister dwarf from GOT., apperently also has a lot of common sense and humourFew other side characters tat doesnt bring much to the main story.Shame that you only have 2 playable characters, Arkance would be a great addition to the gameplay....World of OOAM: good idea teaming up orc and goblin, it was very fun to watching and listening how they interact with each other. Quite good main story with few side quests but the game is stll very short. You can beat the game in less than 20 hours. I beat game on medium difficulty, like most of the games that i finished, not too hard and too easy (im not masochist who wants to beat every game on hardest difficulty, i like to enjoy the game not to be mad whole time playing it).Game mechanics: like in dragon age but simplified version, easy to finish game on the keyboard contoller, dunno why people complaining about it.Music: Composed by Olivier Derivière, performed by the Boston Cello Quartet... its magic! you can taste a bit of it  Of Orcs and Men OST ""My quest begins"" EXTENDED  Cant hate this game, has a big potential for sequel.I reccomend palying this game for everyone and with no doubts i can give this game 6.5/10			"

												Very interesting game with the control of two characters at the same time. Both Styx and Arkail have very unique and well created personalities. Game world and graphics are also great.The only downside of this game is the controls were actually pretty confusing and kinda hard( even for a person like me who is generally pretty good at keybinding and macroing). There is also not enough button configuration for gamepads to hotkey your skills.			"

												When I heard of the game I thought it was a nice idea and was eager to play it. Then I saw and read some reviews and became disappointed and skeptical. But then there was a STEAM sale and I decided to take a shot. It’s good, I should have gone with my gut instinct.You might have some trouble getting into the gameplay at first, and you might end up with a different playstyle than me. I found that the best way was to make the Ogre the tank and get him all the agro (taking the attention of all enemies mainly with shouts) then use the goblin to backstab the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of everything while they’re busy looking at the Ogre. But don’t bite more than you can shew. With a stealthy goblin you can lay waste to almost anything without starting combat.The story is also very good, try it. "

												If you're a fan of goblins and orcs then this is for you, the combat system is something akin to Dragon Age in terms of briefly pausing-and-strategizing however level design is some of the simplest I've seen in ages. Which mind you doesn't have to be a bad thing if all you're looking for is a nice compact, packaged story experience, which Of Orcs and Men delivers in best probably.(I for one was happy not having to scour every level for hours just to find some hidden loot.)The story isn't anything groundbreaking but saying the two main characters aren't likeable would be most untrue. I've yet to see the resolution of the game but given what I've heard from others this game really aces character arcs, which I'll be honest, not many games do all that well.Of Orcs and Men deserves a solid 7.5/10 purely for its interesting atmosphere and enjoyable characters.

												To call this a ""Great"" roleplaying game is to underscore the accomplishments of the great party-based action RPG's that came before this.  It achieves much of what made ""Dragon Age: Origins"" and ""Dragon Age II"" so excellent and yet manages to package their familar elements in a highly oversimplified interface (money becomes ""trade points,"" skill trees are mere ""wheels"") and a combat system that beats to death the game's console orientation in the mind of a PC player.  If you absolutely want to hear a clever rendition of Steinbeck, and are willing to run through some frustrating scenes (albeit save scum possible much like Dragon Age) then purchase the game on sale as I did (although the roughly $12 seems appropriate for the graphics quality).  Playing this game, it becomes clear the Cyanide team who built this game could have been used on the Game of Thrones RPG which is as ugly as genocide compared to this...			"

												The game is an improvement in every aspect to the previous Rpgs from Cyanide Studios. The combat system is very similar to confrontation and caused me no problems whatsoever. The story revolves around orcs and a goblin called Styx getting involved in various situation where you have to get them out. While I agree it certainly is not story rich, Cyanide has finally found a way to make the one dimensional levels of the game interesting with a story that brings forth some interest. The character Styx is very interesting and he occurs in future titles as well. Overall this is a short Rpg one can enjoy, if you like orcs, goblins and their tradition.			"

												Love the characters.  Truly memorable and a strong contrast.The combat is actually pretty enjoyable, the real problem is that it is never explained and most people are too impatient to figure it out.  If you treat Arkail as your tank (keep him in defensive mode 90% of the time) and Styx as your glass cannon, you can't go wrong.Worst part of the game is the foul language Styx is constantly spewing.  Do you kiss your mother with those lips?			"
