												Lucent Heart, what can I say. First off, I'm one of the dedicated players who've been playing this for years and I am happy to see it on Steam. However, it didn't went on here without its struggles. Yes, it doesn't have the best graphics, best storyline or the best anything, but this is pretty old. And if you're like me, chances are, you love this game as much as the other player that you invested over thousands of hours into it. Which I did. I would say Lucent Heart is one of those games you played in your childhood and you simply fell in love with it, like Zelda or FF7, Lucent Heart gives off the same vibe and that's one of the charms of this game.Lucent Heart is a classic anime MMORPG developed by a Taiwanese company called 'Playcoo' and it is staggeringly popular in Japan and other Asian countries, while it is not as popular in the West, it is alive and well through these years thanks to a hardcore fanbase and Subagames who've been running it. Lucent Heart not only offers such a unique storyline and visual design but is bundled with features. Unfortunately, not all of them are out yet because Lucent Heart is currently version 10.0, but regardless, it still have plenty to offer for the time being.FeaturesLover SystemMany people have found their true love through this game, though i like to think it's not a dating game, the theme of this game suggest so. (Note: This game is not dedicated to romance stuff.) But people have met and even marry in RL. Good for them, but what about you, the reader? Well if you are interested, Lucent Heart have a system called Soulmate where you can sign up with Cupid NPC and find your, well, soulmate. And if you feel she/he's the right one for you, then you can marry in-game. And yes, you can marry same-sex user, hurray for equality! (In later version, you may able to create and raise a child regardless of your gender.) GvG/PvPI'm sure you know what these stand for. You can't have MMORPG without a little rivalry. And boy oh boy, you better be careful playing in these matches, it's pretty brutal. In GvG, guilds are challenged randomly by opponent guild according to the system and the Guilds' strength. And you play to win by most points from killing enemies or destroying their flags. Depending how the battle plays out, GvG has 3 rounds and occurs on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Very exciting. However, if you're in a mood for PvP, there is a channel 'Underworld - PvP' where you can freely kill players outside of the towns. Scary. HousingWhile I wouldn't say it's the best feature, you are given an house at lv25 and able to decorate your own place. And if you're brave enough, you can invade people's homes in acquire special items and points, as well as rating their home decoration.  TransportationTransports is a must because Lucent Heart is big, pretty big. If you don't like walking all the way to your destination then you can always hop onto the Airship, there are five airships available to different stops and require no fees. Pretty sweet. But if you prefer riding mounts, keep on reading. Mounts and PetsLucent got unicorns, carriage, lions, motorbikes, rhinos and even robots for mounts. It's quite a spectacle in the town, you'd be surprise how well they fit in. You also get support from your pets, or um.. *cough* slave http://puu.sh/n6H8U/f588594fe3.jpg http://puu.sh/n6HfN/208223361d.jpg Cute, aren't they? Ehehe..hehe Of course, this game also offers ""pets"" handsome guys. Character customisationFrom the start, you may think the character design choices are quite limited, which I agree. However, if you are patient and dive into the game and press B (which opens Item Mall.) You will find quite a lot of clothes, accessories and adjustments to design yourself. Personally, I love the butler set, fits me quite well I would say. But if you descend from the fires of hell, you can buy some flamboyant clothes or if you're a princess from uh- Wateverland, it got plenty of dresses to choose from. Honestly, this game have a few fashion diva and they take it to the max. ClassesNaturally, you start out as a newbie who have yet chosen their class. Classes is consist of 4 classes, 8 advanced jobs, and have three transformations. You start out with a choice of two, Warrior or Mage. Then once you've done your part, the next transformation of class where you given an choice of two more classes and you keep on building up. Depending on the line of class (Check here for a map: http://puu.sh/n6Ig8/c782a0bdaa.png) There's also another class called Phantom Warlock, which is a shapeshifter class. Which I don't know much about but hey, it's pretty cool.  GameplayYou can play Solo, by any means, but it is hard. Lucent Heart is hard. After all, the game is intended for grinding-lovers audience which they spend most of the time in. Strangely enough, it is addictive even if you're playing alone. Lucent Heart is a lot more fun when playing with your friends. You can party up to 6 members and there are plenty of deadly bosses out there to take on. The gameplay isn't exactly amazing but rather nostalgic, in terms of old gaming. Even if you're not in old games, do give this a try. It is a fantastic game, and I enjoy playing it a lot.Overall, the game is not without its flaws but nevertheless, amazing game and I'm happy to give it a long review. Annnnnd if you made it the end, pat yourself on the back for being a reasonable gamer and join me, to critically acclaimed game in its own era, the adventure of Lucent Heart.Note: I may update and correct mistakes on this review.

												TLDR; While this game is undeniably old, thus the dated graphics, but I still think it's a pretty cool game to dive in.Note: This review was done during my experience with the early game life within Lucent Heart, and is subjected to change in the near future when I reaches the later game contents.I've played quite a bit back when the game was handled by a different company. I took a long hiatus from the game then and now I'm onto a fresh start all over again from level 1. It's been quite a while since I last played this, so I've forgotten lots of basic knowledge of the game, therefore I'm no different than any other regular newbies.When you first login into the world, you'll be welcomed by the rather dated graphics. Since this game was released more than 5+ years ago, this is quite understandable. The day and night cycles are implimented and some monsters were supposedly appear during a certain time (which is a pretty neat feature imo).The community so far as I've experienced was very friendly and welcoming. Although there were very much afkers hanging around in town, when you asked for help, a lot of people were eager to offer their knowledge of the game which put a smile on my face. I enjoy playing solo most of the time in MMOs, while sometimes I do find myself participating a few dungeon runs here and there, if the game is possible to tackle alone, I much prefer it that way. That's being said, this game is certainly solo-friendly in the early game, and is very encouraging towards team work later on in game. This game follows the same MMO formula as the others, the questing system is quite generic with the ""go here, kill that, come back and return the quest to this npc"" type and would probably be tiresome as this goes on, but since I'm a casual player, this doesn't concern me that much. Especially understanding that most MMOs were designed to be played that way anyways, and this game certainly tries its best to redeem itself with some fun events with mini DDR-like game (It was called Dance Masters, I think. Correct me if I'm wrong.) and possibly upcoming trivia-type event for players to get involved in.So, overall (as of now) I'm voting ""yes"" for recommending this game :)			"

												I have been playing this game for a bit now, and I have to say, I don't know what all the fuss is about. It's a good game, but if you're a ""hardcore"" FPS (first-person shooter) player, this is probably just not your cuppa. This game centers mostly around community. No, it is NOT a ""dating SIM"", but there are undeniably strong elements in the game that require you to interact with other people. There is no ""world"" PvP in two of the three servers, and there is very little emphasis on it overall (aside from guild wars of course) that I have been able to find thus far. That's not to say there is nothing hardcore about this game, but it's not WoW or LoL. If you're looking for a good game to relax with that you will try to get into the community on, where the majority of the cash shop items are cosmetic and you can't just buy top tier armor on your first day in the game from it, then you might want to consider Lucent Heart. I hope to see yall in game, and if you do decide to join us, come dance with us in Thereall whenever you need a break from the grind. ^.~			"

												Cons:Dated graphics.Combat has some minor interesting features, but remains a standard point-and-click system.Some fashion clothing pieces in the item mall give a direct stat increase bonus.Extremely grindy.Pros:In-Depth romance system: Soulmate Finder, Marriage, Lover Emotes (Hugging, kissing, etc.)Active community: Main city appears quite active. Someone is always willing to help in chat. Lots of people running around, although that might be because this just released on Steam.Horoscope system: You gain stat boosts depending on your horoscope. From critical hit chance, to treasure finding, to love chance(?)Customization: Large amount of fashion options for your character. From entire costume sets, to minions, to a wide variety of mounts.Opinion:I can say that I won't be playing this myself. I am not at all interested in a romance system and the community doesn't feel particularly exciting or different. However, if you're looking for an anime mmo with romancing features that isn't dead and doesn't require a good PC/Laptop to run properly. Chances are you might like this. "

												A lot of people have been bad-mouthing this game when in actual fact, I'm in love with it.I started a couple days ago and I've already got 7 people who are happy to see me the next time I log on and eager to help me in my quests. People are saying it's such a grind to level up when I'm already level 17 because I made high level friends. The community is awesome. Admittidly there are some trolls but you can just blacklist and ignore them. I was happy to be welcomed into the community with open arms and all because I sat near a group of people around a guy on a bench XDThe quests are boring if you have to do them alone but if you take breaks by dancing and chatting with people you make friends who are happy to help you level up.The Cupid system is slow but you can purchase Cupid Keys with real money if you can't be bothered waiting for Cupid.I've only come across two creepy people who I ignored and they left me alone. If you are new to the game then I recommend going on the Athens server and talking to Firewolf because he is happy to help any newbies and doesn't nearly get enough praise for it. He's over level 70 and you can often find him sitting on a bench talking about FDVR XD I am seriously enjoying this game and I am 100% proud to be part of the community.			"

												First of all, I just wanna put this out there before I start my review. I personally like the game, as you can tell from hours of playing, but Ill not be bias and will be professional about the review, rating.my review will consist of Pros, Neutral and Cons( things with * next to it will be unique features in this game)(Before I start doing pros I just wanna say IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HARDCORE, the monsters will kill you if youre not prepare, the dungeon you can't solo at minimum level requirement.... I tried and didn't even make it through the first 3 monsters. a server with open world pvp that is connected to your character at pve server, which means one character can  join both pve and pvp server.) Ok lets start with the pros Pros:***DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION AND CAR RACING (Yes you can play DDR and pk other players and play mario kart)Bright anime style graphics with the medieval-ish theme and yet with modern buildings and structures.*Zodiac systems with your own zodiac power and zodiac armor.(which is pretty cool actually, if you get to level 30)Cupid Matching system, which will match you with players that you have common interests in or in the same level range.GMs are really active in the game( I mean like really active, you can strike a conversion with GM in zone chat and GM will talk if not busy. GM also will join the conversion you're having in zone chat) which not alot of GM in games do that.*Zodiac pets and mythology battle pets. (Such as taurrus pet, death, hercules, apollo, joan of arc..etc)Thousands of quests.New class call phantom warlock(Shape shifter)Neutral :Tab targeting (I put this as neutral because theres no reason to bash on  a play style hard and give it a bad review because it's old style or isn't your style of play)Cons:The monsters are just duplicate of other monster under different name.Skill effects looks plain and boring.Music isn't really good and it makes you wanna turn it off.Lack of good story (I'm BIG HUGE lore reader, league of legend has good lore, WoW, Mabinogi...etc)Isn't really fun without friends or someone to chat with.Quests gets boring.Monster fields are plain with one or two trees here and there.The user interface doesn't look appealing.With this, I hope I can help someone decide if they wanna play this game or notI know it's alot of stuff to read q w q thanks for reading itOver all Ill give this game a 5/10			"

												Ignore the play hours, I played this before it came to Steam. When I was looking for it, I wanted something cute and relaxing, yet fun to play. I'll state some pros and cons. ----------PROS----------- cute animations - marriage system- friendly player base - housing system- content for 2 players - cute chars and clothing----------CONS----------- unstable servers (lags)- very slow combat- 95% of quests are fetch-type quests, just go there kill that - story line is there, but not at al interesting, doesn't pull you in- doesn't keep you interested if you play alone - class imbalance - dated graphics, many bugs- game doesn't change at all, when you ignore the cash shop updates - buggy skills (played priest)Basically this game was fun just because I had someone to play it with. The social aspect is amazing and I have nothing to complain about, but the combat just felt horrible. Most of the time I just found myself autorunning or killing monsters, it seemed to me as if there wasn't even other type of quest. Graphics are dated, although I never really judge a game by it and having that said, I think they're easy to get used to. The leveling is ultra-slow and entire process is just hardcore grind-fest. I don't have anything against that, but it just feels like game has not that much to offer in this department. I can't tell much about crafting/pvp, as I hasn't been introduced to it yet at all by quests. It's fun if you play it with your SO for a few hours, but after all it's worth investing your time into other game.			"

												(Pay no attention to the game-playing time. I've played this game pre-Steam)PROS:- You can look cute since apparently all the GM's ever do is update the item mall- You can only look cute when you buy the clothes though.- Okay I take it back. No pros :<CONS:- Sure it's free-to-play, but it's kind of pay-to-win. You're basically unable to do anything significant (in higher levels) unless you're decked out with your pet squad (consisting of four passive bonds that you can get from gachapons in the item mall) with your matching item mall mount. - You can buy said items above from players with in-game gold. However, I doubt new players can rack up hundreds of millions worth of gold to be able to afford those expensive items. - Bad management in Suba's part; I sent in a ticket several months ago but still no response up to this day. Hey, if you can't do anything about the situation, at least let me know. Don't leave me hangin'- When looking for a soulmate (someone to level with and earn charm points with IN-GAME) equates to attempting to find a signifcant other in-real-life (red flag alert -  I'm only here to play the game, not hook up with you, bud. This is not netflix and chill)			"

												Made me feel nostalgic as balls. Used to play this back at 10th grade, and whenever I hear the soundtrack of Thereall/the login screen, loading screen, and character selection screen, I always feel this strong nostalgia... Like I'm back at 10th grade, about to leave for my ♥♥♥♥ing first final of the year.It was fun, but the game's running on a ♥♥♥♥ing Pay2Win model, and everyone knows it. If I ever do play, it's only when I'm chilling in Thereall doing absolutely nothing. The game is a pretty generic P2W MMORPG. You got a warrior, a mage, and a gunner. You fight monsters for some moronic reason, waste days of your lives on getting a special weapon at level 50, and get bored of it after that because leveling up from level 50 to 60 is as hard as me :^). After that, you just end up internet dating some catfish for the rest of the time you're on the game.Anyway, if you're reading the reviews for this♥♥♥♥♥♥game, I don't suggest you download it. LH is much better. 6/9 - Best RPG on steam 2016 - VogavGaming (pls sobskryb tnx)Memes aside though, if you do end up playing it and need a helping hand for like... 30 minutes (because that's all I can spend on this game before I get bored) then Whisper me. Name's Boidem on this game.			"

												Pros:- Somewhat interesting character designs- Unique game features such as pairing- Online play seems fine, no lag etc- You can level up quickly if you know how to- There is usually at least one server with lots of players in- Missions are usually easy to followCons:- Limited character choice- User interface needs tweeking if not completely re-designing- The game can close without warning in some situations- Some of the most ridiculous in game accessories I'll probably ever see- Boring repetitive missions- Almost non-existent story line (edit: apparently it is there so I'm told)- Music gets annoying (I ended up muting it)- Sound effects are limited- What's even the point in playing? Where does it go?Sorry, I'm not feeling it.			"

												This a Fun and Really good game. the Zodiac Based Skill tree is rather interesting. theirs 5 base classes and 4 2nd tier classes. The pets are Interesting. my Favs are Joan of Arc and King Arthur. Guns, swords, magic and Riding Llamas! Who could ask for anything more? Me cause I'd Like a Proper Drop system! Their No Reliable Wiki list to Tell me Which monster drops what. The Fortune System is also too Capricious. I'm Tired of Gathering all those Matierals to make an Armor I Want and have it Fail cause my Work Fortune so low. Also, Whats with the Sudden Change in difficulty in some Places. I have a level 30 warrior but I Have a Nasty Difficulty spike and get my Butt handed to me by a level 20 monster. These Random Bugs are Frustrating but I Do Enjoy this game. I just wish they have more Informational Wiki and A More Reliable Fortune. Also One craft per Character? ♥♥♥♥ you I Love have the Ability to pull Multiple Jobs.

												Lucent Heart is a free to play Asian styled MMORPG.  Anime characters and social relationship game elements, ultimate end goal of a relationship is marriage.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.Try it, maybe you will like it.For more info:

			In my opinion Lucent Heart has a long way to go before it becomes a great MMO. The story is basically nonexistent and the characters are bland. You might try your hand at Runecraft instead.

												Before i start i want to say this is my first review..Note: this is a older game so im going to be taking that into consideration.Pros:- Controls feel good/user friendly-Community is fairly nice however very small (maybe 100 tops)-Can duel client-GM's are really nice/active atleast once or twice a week-Can run smoothly on low-budget desktops/laptops even netbooks apparently-Community contests oftenCons:-P2W-After level 40 leveling turns into an all out grind (1 lvl per day if lucky) max lvl is 80-Community is small (only vet players left with too much invested)-Players who havent spent irl cash in-game stick out dramaitically.. indirectly forcing you to buy stuff or forever feel like a hobo-Gacha's RnG drop rate is really bad (a friend spent about $200 on gacha's just for 1 pet)-Marriage system is really weird. I had a really old women talking dirty to me (she was married irl with her husband watching the conv... really awkward and yes this is normal for this game as i seen it happen to others...-Can't survive off of the in-game lootI have a lot more to say but the reveiw looks highly unorganized as it is and i think enough was said at this point.Once upon a time this game was probably good...Overall, i wouldnt suggest this game unless:-Your loaded with irl cash-You really like old women creeping you-You dont mind playing with under-aged children in-game (don't drop the soap)			"

												Well this game is amazing. Now im not saying that its perfect not all mmos are. Played it before it came onto steam and had a blast with it. It's not for everyone but it's still enjoyable. Pros: Good graphics even though they're dated.Simple gameplayFunhas a zodiac system and blood type system can get married (note:easier if you have same zodiac sign)Cons:Can get boringconfusing controlls at firstDoesn't appeal to everyoneNot much character creationno jump actionMy rating: 7/10			"

												Lucent Heart, a game of vengeance, love and big ♥♥♥♥♥♥s pet that are your slaves as you go on your adventures, it's been over 2/3 years since I started playing this game, it was previously a beanfun game then a Suba and now it's on Steam in collaboration with Suba, but the question you're all wondering is.""What is Lucent Heart?""For that we'll have to go back all the way to the year of 1983, yes, 1983, why? I don't know. But why are you reading a review for a MMO? Everyone has their tastes if you're reading a review to know if you want to play a game, it's the same as not liking something without trying it.Basic review:Game sucks. Fighting sucks. Suba sucks (mostly). Community sucks. BUT, this game is still fantastic, why? Because we were able to create bonds with people I'll never forget after a week? A month? A year? Years? And those people are still there? It's hard to find these people in real life but to find that specific person that is miles away from you? On a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game? It's like some weird ♥♥♥♥ed voodoo destiny. Being best friends or lovers, those people that you meet here (of course don't trust everyone right off the bat) will make the experience of what we call Lucent Heart, much better.Do I reccommend this game? No, like I said it's cancerous.But you should not listen to me and still give it a try yourself, so later you can tell others or even people that you met on this game how cancerous it is.			"

												The game has some nice features I think would work tremendously better in a non-MMO setting. One big issue is it says the emphasis is on building relationships, but not much in the game directs that focus. Several features certainly make that easier, but it feels like only someone who is expressly looking for that niche will take advantage of it . If there was more to it then maybe it could attract a larger audience.			"

Oh, yeah, it is about ""love"" but you got to get an♥♥♥♥♥load amount of gold in order to marry another player which takes wayyy too long. And trying to talk to the support if you need help? Psh, no. They don't do nothing to even help if you summit a bug. This game is extremely unfair and poorly designed. So in all, this game is worthless and not worth even downloading it.

												Personally, I can relate to the people who love this game, as a person who played FlyFF almost a decade ago for a couple thousand hours. It's the community and the memories that I'll forever keep close to myself, as they were an integral part to me getting through my teen years.As well, I realize that this is another one of those games similar to those that wanted to capitalize on the ""golden age of RO"", when there were tons of MMORPGs similar to it (And that's in North America. There were a dime a dozen in Hong Kong and South Korea). And while it was released a few years ago, it's now on Steam, and has to compare to what we've got here in 2016. And unfortunately, it hasn't aged well.If you want to play a free MMO, you're in luck because as of writing this in February of 2016, you're bound to find a hundred other free MMOs that far surpass this one in overall quality.But if you're curious and wants to see what old 3D Korean Grindfests were like, feel free to jump in. It's free, after all. Unfortunately, expect the following:- A grindfest- A community that's close-knit, so it'll be difficult to get in on already-established ones.- A shallow, lackluster combat system- Graphics and sound that haven't aged wellAs such, I can't recommend this game, as it's far past its prime.

												Honestly I didn't even want to continue playing it. It's an okay game if you like simple selections for character creation. As well as if you're used to playing on a browser mmorpg. It feels like a newly created game that was created by someone who is very new at making games. Feels really old fashioned with graphics moving skills etc. But if you're looking for something fun and interesting I really suggest not unless you're bored or don't mind crappy stuff.			"

												I didn't get to far in this game but what I did see I didn't like.The beginner quests are kinda clunky, and then the battle system.... oh my gosh, it was bad. I'd go up to an monster attack it, then either I'd stand there not beeing able to move or antything while the monster kept wacking at me, or I'd be running off in random directions complety missing the monster when I tried to hit it, and it still keeps on hitting me. But what really annoyed me is how it would keep swiching out of the game to another window so I only knew what was gooing on half the time.  trying to attack one thing was not easy and it wasn't the fun kind of diffculty either.  Like I know battles in Tera are really hard but also really fun and satisfying. Still I know I it's not fair to compare this game to that game, as you could eaisly say they are in differnt ""weight classes""  but still even compared to games like maplestory or Uncharted Watters which i think are at least closer to beeing in the same league they certianly pull of their games right from the getgo much better then what I saw of this one.  I'd say it's less of a time waster playing those games then this one.Also the Area was complety empty no sign of other players at all, now I might of given them some credit for having a single player tutorial campagin but least give me some sign that there's other people on line, and it didn't seem like there was a story arc gooing on with the tutorial quests it was just a group of people who refered me to the next goup getting me slowly closer hopefully to a regular town.The cash shop had a bunch of nice items in it, but they aren't cheap, while i don't think they are super expensive compared to the cash shop in other games I've played I think they are on the higher side of the average.So while this isn't the worst game I've played, I've seen worse.  There are plenty of other games that are much more worth your time.			"

												This game has been a blast for me. I've been playing this game since its release and it has made a ton of progress from where it started. The Devs are really working hard on the game even if the development is slow. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the survival genere and people that are patient to adapt to it's high learning curve. Beware of hackers, dupers, and glitchers for these people may ruin your game experience if you let them get to your head. As always stay alive and survive and I'll see you at North West Air Field.

												this game is great but i have questions for it1. why do you need to put your bloodtype in this game? i mean rly? ok have you guys rly have not seen a site that asks for your bloodtype no but why? thats what a stalker would say yes i know this ame is trying to know you but still it just makes no sence why you need to put the blood type but not even a single site asks for your blood type execpt for this game particualy you havent seen a site asking you a blood type i havent seen a site that asks for a bloodtype none just none execpt for this game and besides why not just not do it well too bad because you cant do it if it dosent allow you i dont know my blood type so i putted b instead persons who begin this game would be asking questions why it asks your blood type oh and thats not all when i started begin playing my screen was flashing black when ever i play it no matter how long it would still be there idk if its my computer or the game but if its the game then fix it2.you dont get to choose your own star shaped animal it actully randomizes it instead now your gonna ask me why this is a queastion but you figure it out now you see once you began filling up the name and stuff it actully randomizes what star shaped animal you would be i got leo and i was lucky because leo is good at fighting and i was really surprised oh and thats not all theres actully a love meter too this got me confused why they added a love meter but i havent even seen a fighting game that has love in it like rly? THIS IS A FIGHTING GAME NOT A LOVE GAME oh and by the way i dont even think you can date in this game and if there is then why does it? this seems to be a messed up game if you ask me and besides this shouldint be a little bit of love in there it suppose to be all fighting not love oh and why do you even need a id to buy and view your inventory like why do you even need that fighting games shouldint have that ya know and dont ask me why they added an id because the company who made this game are rly stupid to see if this is how a fighting game is i bet they havent even played a fighting game before but i dont even know why they came up with this idea like rly and id to buy and look in your inventory like that doesent make sence oh and speaking oh and thats not all you cant run because the walking animation is the run so you dont need to do that but that spoils the fun here oh and dont blame me the walking animation being the running im just saying this because i played enough fighting online games this game is a game that literlly doesent make sence			"

												Where do I start?The sound is repetitive and horribleThe gameplay is on par with the very worst we could offer in 2005The graphics are as aboveThe sounds, oh my god, the soundsI have 27 minutes of playtime, and I got  stuck twice because the collision detection is so bad.The art direction is pathetically trite. Nothing unique or clever about it, as near as I can tell. It's like a bad knock off of flyff. In fact, if you want to play a mediocre MMO from the far east, play Flyff instead, that way you'll only feel like you're living in 2006. I can honestly say that normally a game can be so bad it's entertaining. With this, it's simply so bad that it's bad. It's genuinely complete garbage. I bought a $40 rice cooker that overheats when you cook rice with it and turns itself off. I am less disappointed in that than I am with this game, and I didn't even pay for it. It was literally not worth the time it took for me to download the 3.1 gigabytes that I can only assume was taken up by the intro cinematic, considering that all five assets in the game are used everywhere that I've seen. Genuinely, those 27 minutes are 27 minutes of my life that I will never get back, 27 minutes that I could have spent with a beloved family member, or maybe ate a nice lunch, took a bath or a long shower, built something, something, anything, other than waste it with this. I am 27 minutes older, and 27 minutes closer to death thanks to this game, and it's one of the few times in my life where I regret the time it took from my existence. May god have mercy on their souls.4/10			"

												ive been playing since the closed beta the reason it says i only have clocked 1.6 hours on it is because i didnt play through steam this game has a lot of pros as well as a few cons lets be honest every mmorpg is gonna have cons Pros:nice visials and vibrant coloursCommunity is good from what ive seentheir is a IM (item mall) because they have to make money to keep the servers up but its not as bad from what ive seen compared to other games that i wont mentionscombat is fun and not to complicatedvery nice couple system from what ive seenzodiac affects your character which i find coola nice varitey of enemiesthe maps are very open which i find very niceno salt from what ive seenCons:can be confusing at first I.E finding where to get your first class advancement or navigatingcan be grindy at times but hey what do we expect ofc the exp rate is gonna get lower the higer leveled we getinventory management i found a bit more of a hassle as well as noticing your inventory fills up quicknavigating to get your next location can be tricky at timesTHE LAST VERDICT/RATINGin the end i highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes mmorpgs so im giving this game a solid 9/10 "

												Lucent Heart is a great game, I have been playing it for maybe a little over a month now. Yes sometimes it gets laggy but it is a fun game overrall. The reason i got Lucent Heart was to find something i could play with friends. I even made more friends through Lucent Heart! I love how its linked to our Zodiac signs too!! It is so cool using Dance Show to dance and that you can have people dance along with you. I also love that you can team up with other players to help you with quests and talk to cupid to find your soulmate. People think this game is terrible or bad but they just haven't even tried, yes i agree with some comments saying it is laggy but the comments like how girls play guy characters and guys play girl characteers.  I am a girl playing a girl character... but anyway i would recommend this. My character is DeathToTheStars and i hope to see you around<3			"

												I wish I could recommend this game, but in order for that to happen, I would actually have had to play the game. After downloading the game, I can log on and click Start Game, and it brings me to the page where I choose which server I want. And that's as far as I get. The game immediately fails after that, giving me a pop-up saying ""Client Crash! Blah blah blah..."" I've tried all the different servers, and still the same notice. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, and still the same error message. I emailed Suba support, but they never responded. It's too bad, this game seemed like it could be fun, with cute graphics and a good concept. But these technical errors really need to be fixed.			"

												This game is getting relatively low reviews so I'll throw in my opinion and say that overall I quite like it :)It's sweet and unique and they seem to be adding new content too.It's just a simple, cute MMO with a dating component, really. But it does it pretty well.Also, the addition of player housing is very welcome in a game that puts focus on the social component like this, so I applaud the developers on that decision!Yeah, not a bad game!
