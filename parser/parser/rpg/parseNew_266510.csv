My ImpressionThis game gave me the classic pen-&-paper RPG feeling that I never had... and I'm very grateful for that.I had quite a few rage-quit-moments but I always kept coming back for more and if this doesn't say a lot - what does?TL;DRTo give you guys a little heads-up for what's coming in the long run.PositiveMediocreNegative~ Luck+ Long Story+ Interesting Storylines+ Lots of Encounters+ Lots of beautiful stages~ often the same ones+ Best Dealer ever+ Fun Combat~ Frustrating at times- awkward camera+ Tons of Items+ Atmospheric MusicThe StoryPlaying on Warlord difficulty the Story Mode with its 13 bosses entertained me for a good 25h.Additionally, if you read the cards you play like you should, you will realise that there are some great storylines, some short, some longer, which create a consistent fantasy world together.One of the cool things about this game is, that because of the amount of Encounter- and Equipment cards there are basically no two games that play out the same way. This results in every session feeling unique and fresh.Other than the Story Mode there is also the Endless Mode where you don't have to defeat a boss but have to keep going until misfortune finally finds you, delivering a great end-game content where you can play to your heart's desire.The WorldYou somehow find yourself in front of a table in a huge building, dimly illuminated, a spider crawling over the tomes and flasks on the desk and your Dealer in front of you, laying out the cards.It gives off a great vibe of mystery and for all those arachnophobic people - you can disable the spider ;-).The second half of the game you will find yourself in the different stages which are often filled with traps, which you have to try and use to your advantage. Moreover, even 30h into the game, I still discovered some new stages, which always made for a cool change. On the other hand, most of the time you will find yourself playing the same stages over and over again.The CharactersThe one and only real character in the game is the Dealer, and he is all you could ask for. With his witty comments, he will entertain and threaten you more than once. Sometimes his comments appear to be a little out of place, but that's more a reason for a grin on my face than for a complaint.The GameplayThere are three basic parts of the game. The first is where you sit at the table and traverse over the cards laying on it. Every time you walk onto a new card, one food is consumed and you are healed, if you have no food you begin to starve and take damage. Afterwards, the card is revealed and the encounter triggers. Such an encounter can mean a lot of things, most of the time you get to choose your action and must then select one of four cards, which can result in something from huge success to huge failure. Depending on your luck, you will then gain either resources, blessings, equipment, a token (which gains you access to new encounters) or lose any of the aforementioned, receive a curse or you will have to fight - which brings you into the second part of the game.In the case of a combat encounter, you will be transported into a stage together with your enemies and engage in a combat for life and death.Your basic moves are (move and button on X-Box 360 controller):Attacking (X)Countering (Y)Dodging (A)Bashing (B)Using your weapon ability (LB)Using your special ability (RB)Especially with the right equipment the combat in the game is a lot of fun and it feels just so good to go out of it unharmed, after all, you can learn the attack patterns of your enemies and act accordingly.However, sometimes your biggest foe will be dealing with the camera, which likes to take some weird angles, rendering you basically blind and unable to react to some attacks.Other than that there are a lot of really cool items which grant you bonuses like receiving health or items for winning encounters and tons of other fun stuff for you to discover.Last but not least you will encounter merchants such as shops, jewellers, tinkerers, mages, healers and priests - on these occasions you can buy new equipment, food, blessings, remove curses and heal yourself. Every store, however, has different prices so think twice before buying food from a mage ;-).The VisualsWhat it does, it does great - the visuals deliver a mysterious atmosphere and all particles and enemies have an applicable design. The stages are also very different in their appeal and often represent the card they came from really well, which increases immersion.The SoundAt the desk and in the stages the music is great. Additionally, the voice acting of the Dealer deserves praise. Other than that the sound effects of the enemies and attacks match pretty well, but can sometimes get annoying (I'm looking at a pack of 16 rats here...).The VerdictIf you were ever interested in pen-&-paper RPGs or just like RPGs and/or card games in general and feel that your luck is not lower than average I strongly advise this game to you, as you can definitely have a lot of fun over many hours.May the heart of the cards be with you ;-)NoteIf you have read this far - thank you.I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.

												Hand of Fate is a blast to play, but not easy to describe. It is obviously a game with cards, but not really a card game in the usual sense. Think of it as a random adventure game where the cards are your storyline, equipment, quests, enemies, curses and blessings. And the actual battles are fought in Hack & Slash real time encounters which mirror the cards you have on hand. I hope there will soon be a Demo available for people to try it, because its really unique and should be experienced instead of described. The strongest point of the game is probably the Narrator of the Card Dealer, very well done and highly immersive and even comments on your situation or what cards you have on hand. The second strong point is the randomness and replayability, every adventure you start will be different, depending on the cards you choose and how they are played.The presentation is top notch, the card animations fluid and pretty. Only the switches to the Battles are a bit tiresome after a while, but they can be skipped. There is a big luck factor in the game which makes things interesting, it can screw you over royally, but also make you come back against all odds. You will die, and you will not be successful in every quest and adventure. And you probably have not many ways to prevent it, its the luck of the cards.If something is missing then maybe character variety, there is only the main character. At least the different equipment is displayed nicely on him.The real time battles are short encounters against one or more groups of enemies with varying abilities and are visually pretty and also randomized. The actual fighting is not too difficult as long as you learn how to block & dodge and use the abilities. The store page says controller recommended, but i played with M&KB just fine. The Battles might be easier with a controller.The game feels like playing a real board game and I highly enjoyed it so far. It came out of Early Access and was updated regularly. I encountered no technical issues or bugs, its pretty polished from what i can say. I think this game should be played =)			"

												Imagine a board game where the board ""spaces"" are cards laid out side-by-side.  You move your token from card to card, travelling across them until you reach the end of them.  As you ""step"" on each card, it is revealed.  Whatever the card reveals informs the adventure - an ambush by thieves, a mysterious cave, a helpful vendor, it's all randomized and set out under the cards for you to discover.Now imagine the cards are composed of a deck of cards that YOU build, as well as some cards the ""gamemaster"" stuffs in there.  You don't know what you'll get in your travels, or in what order, and that is the core gameplay.All combat is resolved in a simple, but elegant, action combat system similar to the Batman Arkham games (WASD, E to ""counter"", Space to roll, and sometimes # keys for specials) and it's fun.  Are you wearing a magic cap that makes your hits explode with gold?  Sounds good, until you remember that you revealed the ""gold curse"" card and the more gold you're carrying the slower you move.  Or not!  It's up to you.So far only 4 hours in, absolutely loving it.  Why has it taken so long for this kind of action CCG to come out?			"

												Hand of Fate is an amazingly fun card game based adventure with a hack and slash style combat system. Its wildly addictive and honestly some of the most fun I've had in a game for a while, and I intend to play much more. This game makes me feel like I'm sitting down for a single player DnD game with the dealer as sort of a ""dungeon master"", laying out the adventure for me to go through. There are a lot of stories to be told that keep fairly short but interesting, and will occasionally result in combat. The combat of the game isn't amazing or revolutionary, but I find it fun and enjoyable. I'm into hack and slash style gameplay and this game does it well enough while not overstaying its welcome. The combination of RPG, card game, adventure with some roguelike elements mixed in, come together in Hand of Fate to make an outstanding experience that makes you just say ""One more round""Pros:-Unique genre-Strong and interesting atmosphere-Fun stories and adventures-Competent combat system-Several different weapons, armor and accessories to unlock-Strong difficulty(Starting at about 4 hours in)-Nice ambient soundtrackCons:-Occasionally Janky animations-Flow of combat can be somewhat awkward Buy At Full Price  "

												I never do these reviews but this game absolutely deserves it.It is based on the mechanic that would get me to actually buy and play a video game based on Pokemon or Magic the Gathering. . . 1) a card comes up with an enemy2) you actually fight the enemy The flavor packet is in the scenarios, An ambush, a travelling circus, a hungry vampire, some of which are decided by your ability to ""draw success"" card from 4 shuffled cards.And if you can't make it? CHANGE YOUR DECK to be more favorable to that thing you need... food, gold or health.Insanely replayable. Insanely unique. Insanely fun.			"

												If I had to describe this game with one world, I guess it would be ""wow"".""Wow""Few games lately have made me feel such wonder, had played many as videogames are my main passtime. But what makes this game so special? So unique? Well, it is a card game, and there are plenty of card games. It is an action game, and there are plenty of action games. And yet this game can suspend my disbelief like no other.This game just want to make you fell like you are... playing a game, and in this simplicity lies its brilliance. It does not try to suspend your disbelief to great heights and in doing that it brings an incredible immersion. All I need to feel is that I am playing a game with that strtange fellow in front of me. A fellow that, like no other character, I wish to pull of the screen just to have a chat over some beverages. Or maybe... a game of cards.It is impressive how a game that does not create anything new, but just mixes what we have already seen in a way we have never seen can fell so fresh, so different.As for the game itself, it plays as a roguelite. The randomness, the decisions based on your circinstances, the reset after a failure. Failure that does not bring the game back to the beggining, as the bosses you already defeated will remain defeated, but the entire board of the one you are chasing gets reset. Failure that can still reveal some minor rewards as you unlock tokens. Or even just comments from the dealer.And I press forward. Not for a quest to save the world, but for the wonder of discovery after each new card. Or even some old ones. Or just to spend some more time with this intriguing character that feels almost real.

												I went in unexpecting what this game had to offer, I was surprised by how its played and what it is. Very different,innovative and very unique. it is an  rpg/deck building/ action packed/ addictive card game that comes to life as you are dealt the cards of fate.The game gives you a hero outfitted with certain gears and debuff (Depending on deck stack), your job? To fight the dealer by traveling through his deck of cards and facing the boss.He shuffles and places the cards in random positions where you move a token across them to see what your of fate is, you'll have a certain amount of heatlh and food to make it through to the boss. Run out of health? you die, run out of food? you'll take damage as you move instead of heals, reach 0 hp andyou'll have to start the entire adventure deck over. You'll encounter monsters, Trap cards, Quest cards,shops to gear yourself, reward cards,  or even dangerous cards that will throw you completely off and thus could completely cost you the game.Since the game is randomized depending on what you put into the deck randomization will be what you put into the deck which is required along with his cards, After each deck either by death or actually winning you'll get tokens for completing every card's quests that is played and whatever drops from the boss. You'll also get rewarded with even MORE cards you can throw in the deck. After beating 3 sets of his deck, the game gets more challenging with Paradigm cards (This is what i label them), it'll reward you but at the same time buff your enemies up by giving them MORE abilities, more strength, or any other crazy benefits you can think of to beat you down, before you know it the game gets even harder forcing you to throw even more strategic cards into play. Items and such will help you but those are completely randomized also so hope that luck is on your sideThe combat is quite simple, you'll be set in an arena, you'll be able to evade, stun if you have your shield, or counter hit your enemies with.  Its very similar to batman arkham combat style.With what there is now the game is playable and has plenty of randomization and contents that you can really enjoy.+ Great voice acting+ Innovative and unique  gameplay+ Rogue-Like adventures since its completely random decks thrown at you+ Gets a bit challenging as the game goes on once you complete set, and harder, and harder so play your cards right+Controller support+ Graphics are quite decent+ The music is done well and fits the game+ Voice acting from the dealer is fantastic, he is so vibrant and speaks so much.+ REPLAYABILITY  = PLENTY with endless mode.+ Good writing and lore on the cards, very intresting cards + Good variety of enemies, and cards that will kick your♥♥♥♥♥br>+ The best polished work I've invested in from an early access game which didn't require me to place anymore cons about the game, I love it. Con - Only the Camera can beat you if it twist in a strange direction.- Some battle could be fustrating, Very fustrating near the end if your luck hits rock bottom. ROCK BOTTOM ! lol. Others +-Try playing with a controller, It might be easier for some of you the handle works great equally with kb + m now.+- Dlc content comes out later on, Cannot wait+- Worth every penny			"

Hand of Fate Review (Full Length) 
A Guide for Hand of Fate
By: Chewable C++

			This isn't really a ""guide"". This is the unabridged version of my Hand of Fate review, which exceeds Steam's character limit for reviews roughly twofold!		


Hand of Fate is a rare beast indeed - a successful genre blend! It is simultaneously a proof of concept and a masterpiece. It is something truly unique and wonderful.The genre blend is so unusual, that the gameplay is very difficult to explain succinctly. But, I shall try:Hand of Fate is an RPG card game rogue-lite with an interesting Four Card Monte mechanic and simple, but fun brawl style combat.Yeah. It's hard to know exactly what that means, but if you'd like to know more, then go ahead and read the Gameplay Explained section below.Besides the engaging gameplay, Hand of Fate has superb art and animation, music and sound, expertly combined into a highly atmospheric, immersive experience.In short, I highly recommend it.

Should You Buy It?Yes! Well... probably! It's a bargain at the current sale price, and quite well worth it at full price also.But, here are a few reasons why you might want to stay away:* If you really hate reading. You'll have to do a decent amount here.* If you really, really hate roguelikes. Single sessions are fairly short, except for endgame Endless Mode (there is autosave).* If you are allergic to repetition. Yes, there will be some repetition per the nature of this genre mix, but I think it's entirely tolerable, and unavoidable given the nature of the genres.* If you can't stomach the idea that a little grinding may be required to unlock everything and/or 100% the game. If you aren't an obsessive completionist, however, this won't be a problem at all! If you are, it will take you about 50-100 hours to unlock all achievements.* If you can't stand a video game character occasionally insulting you (masochists, take note).Otherwise, you have every reason to play the game, especially:* If you want to try something different* If you like indie games with high production values and great atmosphere* If you like card and/or board games* If you like brawling style combat* If you like rogue-likes and games with high replay value* If you like collecting/unlocking mechanics in games What about the DLC?Basically, you don't need it to start with. It's more for expanding endgame possibilities. See full review for more details.			"

												Below you'll find a written and video impression on the game


YouTube™ Video: Hand of Fate (PC, Full Release): Impressions (Indie game roguelike, gameplay and review) 

			Views: 4,035		

			Hand of Fate (PC, Full Release): Impressions (Indie game roguelike, gameplay and review) Hand of Fate was an early access and now in it's full release!		

 Hand of Fate melds roguelike(lite) with action adventure, and even some CCG elements. You, a figure on the board, will be traversing through a dungeon made of cards. As you land on each card it'll reveal a new event. These events are varied, and can range from loot drops, to enemy encounters, or even a quest, just to name a few. It's a very interesting take on the genre.Hand of Fate features incredible visual aesthetics. The dealer, the table, the cards, almost all aspects of the game is masterly designed, and executed with incredible technical finesse. The game is gorgeous visually, and the audio, though subtle, is very memorable and suiting to the game. The dealer is voice acted well, and there's a snarky charisma about him. He's a likable character, and that's good, because you'll be with him for the majority of the game.Mechanically it seems so simple. A card based roguelike where the deal of the cards IS the RNG system. Once you play the game you'll be wondering why it took so long for some one to come up with this concept. It seems so obvious and fitting once it's played. The game also offers a great deal of meta gaming and offer a fair amount of complexity for players who like to dive into the nuance of a game.Though there is plenty to love about Hand of Fate, there is one area that seems lacking, or even uninspired in comparison to the rest of it. The combat. The combat will play out very similar to say the Batman Arkham games, where there's an attack, a dodge, stun, and counter button. You'll be mashing that attack and stun over and over again until either the counter or dodge prompts come up. Like I said, very similar to the Batman games. Though it shows some similarities to other games, it's not as smooth, and feels rather stiff and clunky by comparison. It's certainly not my favorite part of the game. Luckily for us, the combat is not the center ring of this, and it's very much a side mechanic, used to enhance the true character of the game, the procedurally generated dungeon running.Overall, Hand of Fate is a fantastic entry to the roguelike(lite) genre, that introduces some very interesting concepts that seem to fit right in. If you're interested in the game, I think I can safely recommend the buy!Pros:- Brilliantly conceptualized in themeing - Great Graphics- Excellent genre blending- Addictive gameplay with lots of incentive to replayCons:- Combat, though not terrible, feels sluggish and uninspired compared to the rest of the game- Lacking in the options menu			"

======================================Hand of Fate (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DRFrom the very start you should be sold on this roguelite with TCG elements, realtime rhythm combat, and gorgeous graphics featuring a great use of light, shadow, and color.======================================Pros+ Presentation: You will be drawn in.+ Graphics: Gorgeous use of light, shadow, color, and special effects.+ Gameplay: A satisfying mix of choose your own adventure and rhythm combat.+ Combat: Speaking of, it just keeps getting smoother!+ Audio: Special shoutout for the dealer's narration. Everything else is solid.+ Genre: Any genre with TCG elements is nice, but mixed with a roguelite also featuring realtime combat is something special.+ Controller: Supports both dinput and xinput!+ Features: There are many wonderful game elements crammed in.Cons- The narration can become repetitive.- The ocassional bug.- Max graphics performance intensive.Neutral+/- With subtitles on, dialogue will often overlap things.======================================IntroductionIn Hand of Fate, from what I can surmise, you are in some sort of netherworld or afterlife and have met with a dealer who plays a card game with your life at stake. This game is beautiful in a lot of ways, from the narration, to the environment and visuals, to the overall presentation. Early on, the game is very balanced, growing in difficulty as you progress. It also features a roguelike element, in that if you lose, you start at the beginning of the floor again. The roguelike comparison mostly ends there, besides luck being an element, but there is also a choose your own adventure feel to the game that adds longevity and a breath of fresh air!GameplayIn this card game, you have cards that both you and the dealer place into the deck. The deck is then laid out like a dungeon, and you traverse it. Each step, or new card, costs food, but there are gain cards that you can draw that can give food, money, or equipment. There are also pain cards that will make you lose resources or health, too. So there is in almost all things an element of risk vs reward, and this is good. There is also resource management: You will have to be wise with your spending. The right or wrong gear can save or cost your life.This game features real-time rhythm-based combat, in an interesting mix. You can attack at any time, but if you wait and time your button presses, you can dodge, or parry enemy attacks automatically. With every update it seems to get smoother, allowing for a fun and engaging flurry of attacks that flow together with bliss.There is also an element of stacking the deck, as you gain more powerful equipment, and more situations in which you know the outcome to pit yourself against, you can make sure to load the deck with only encounters and equipment suited to the floor ahead. In this way, early on, success can be guaranteed, but later on, it will become very beneficial and perhaps required.Other gameplay features include and endless mode, mini dungeons complete with traps and treasure, a card-based mixup game where you can actually track the cards, and inventory management in the form of being able to buy/sell extra cards at shops.GraphicsThe graphics in Hand of Fate can be as simple or immersive as you want, ranging from murky at the lowest settings to absolutely gorgeous when maxed out, although this can be quite performance intensive. The use of color, light, shadow, cartoonish and realistic aspects are all outstanding. There is also a great use of special effects. Everything feels immersive and hand-tailored to perfection.The environments are gorgeous, from the dealer's room to the mini-dungeons to the encounter fields and even the cards themselves. Everything in this game drips quality and polish. This game is obviously a labor of love for the developers.I should also mention that the animations and transitions, which can be jittery at times, are really well done!AudioIf you've heard the dealer speak, then you likely know how nice the audio in this game is. Everything is crisp, with a good recording quality, and here too, drips polish. The sounds of weapons slicing, clashing, and bouncing off of shields are all quite nice, and probably some of the most common you will hear aside from the dealer.The music is good, although I find it blends into the background sneakily most of the time. The large majority of the game is made up of the various sound effects, all of which, again, are nice. Unfortunately, I can't say much specific about the audio that would convey to you just how it all sounds when you're actually playing the game.ConclusionHand of Fate is more of an indie goldmine than an indie gem. It oozes polish and is a glorious mashup of TCG and roguelite featuring rhythm-based combat that still allows for real-time as well. It features quality music, an outstanding voiceover, flowing combat, a wonderfully refreshing choose your own style, and good resource management qualities. You owe it to yourself to pick this game up and enjoy!====================================== "

Early Access Review
								This game is hard to explain. To call it a ""card based RPG"" is a misnomer, even though thats what it is. Its kind of like playing those old RPG board games like HeroQuest, mixed with the Lone Wolf books, mixed with an ARPG. Its really unique. I'm an old jaded gamer and Ive never seen anything like this. Its awesome.Basically, you have a deck of cards, your opponent (a mage who you are playing against and who narrates the story - I think the voice is the narrator from Fable 2 but Im not sure) has a deck of cards (encounter cards). He lays out encounter cards face down, and you move a token across them, choosing where you go. When you land on a card, it is flipped over and an encounter ensues. Sometimes its good, sometimes its bad, and sometimes its combat. Sometimes it can be good or bad depending on what you choose to do and what card you draw (success, failure ect). There are item cards, weapon cards, armor cards.As you move through the levels you gain more cards. At the end of each sequence, you start a new one and can build your deck based on the cards you won in the last deck. You also build your encounter deck, as you win new encounter cards as well.Combat is resolved in a 3rd person ARPG style. Sometimes theres traps and environmental hazards as well. Its pretty simple, attack, counter, block, roll. You can also get power ups/downs and special one-use cards. Its really fun. It doesnt take a whole lot of strategy at first, but the enemies and maps do get more complex as you go. Certain attacks cant be blocked or countered and must be avoided, some enemies have ranged attacks, and so forth.My biggest complaint is that the camera is fixed, which can be a big pain in certain areas. A ""maze of traps"" where you are dodging flames and spears comes to mind, as well as in encounters where you cant see the enemies attacking you from off screen because you cant rotate the camera to look at them.That is pretty much the major flaw of the game. Fixed cameras in ARPGs are not a good idea. Fortunately, its reltively minor and since the game is still in E.A. at the time of this writing, maybe it'll be implemented later.That shouldnt stop you from getting this unique and awesome game, though.

												Before you dive into positive reviews take a look at amount of time reviewers spent in this game. Most of them have approx. 6 hours and I would leave positive review too if I didn't spent a bit more time in this game. Only 2.6% of player base completed this game and there is reason behind this. The more you play the more game becomes annoying rather than enjoying. Yes, narrator's voice is beatiful, music is beatufil too, aesthetics is good, but this game some serious gameplay problems. First of all, the way diffuclty inrecreases is absolutly irratating - new ""event"" cards become a lot more diffulty in terms of randomness or difficulty of combat. For example, there is event card which will reduce your max HP by 66% if you fail to pass 25% roll. So you can have almost a perfect run and ruin it just by failing this event. And it's a pretty big deal, because it's not like winning an event grants you perma win, you work really hard trying to accumilate as much equipment as possible, but it still wouldn't be enough to win a final fight, becase of this - the combat system is really bad.When you play for the first time, combat seems fine, of course, it's not outstanding, but it's fine for this type of game, but later, when you unlock more events, combat becomes pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ because there is a huge change that you face a pretty big amount of tough enemies while wielding ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rusty axe. And it's boring. It's boring to fight 6 enemies when each of them requires at least 20 hits to kill. I'm not even taking in consideration fact that you can encounter mini-bosses who will heal allies and has twice as much hp. There is no variety in weapons - no 2h weapons, no duals, no ranged - only 1h and shield. All bosses have pretty much the same skill set, there is also no variety in that. There is also very annoying things like ""unblockable"" attacks and amount of enemies who can do that increases with amount you play, it's verry annoing because some of them is faster then your counter attack animation so it can lead to a situation where you receive almost guarnteed damage, combine it with fact that combo counter (thing that will increase your damage for some weapons) seems to be broken because it  sometimes resets when you roll (the only way to dodge unblockable attack) and sometimes it's not, sometimes you can make a few steps with combo still active, sometimes it's resets when you stop attacking for a few moments. For me this game feels like pretty mediocore early access title, it needs a lot more polishing and variety which is not the case right now.Buy it only if you want to enjoy narrator's voice and music for 6h hours and then never launch it again.

One line verdict: A very pleasant surprise, mixing light combat with rpg, and deckbuilding elements. Grab it if it sounds right, because it is.Pros:- Excellent and fresh concept: The mix works well, giving the player some of all worlds. Marvelous voice acting: Top notch and plenty of commentary from the GM. This is how it should be done.- Gorgeous graphics of the cards and coherent one within the 3d-fighting world.- Well written cards with sometimes alternate texts, the perfect amount of reading required.- A real chance to influence the random elements of the game when you draw one of four cards that were shuffled.- Plays really well with PC xbox-gamepad controller. I recommend using a gamepad for this.- It's fun! Yups, that counts...Cons:- Feels little too easy the first 3-4 chapters, but becomes harder, and that's in the very start of the game.- Lacks adjustable difficulty settings, but makes that in part up by having an eternal mode. The game is geared towards the casual leaning to intermediate player or the experienced ones searching for some fun and well paced action. Hence, this doesn't have to be a con.- The combat system could possibly have gotten an overhaul for the more demanding players: It's somewhat too simplistic even if it is indeed challenging in it's own right. Feels too static now despite the fact that this wasn't ever aiming to be the next Arkham et.c.- When the shuffle is done it is sometimes impossible to understand where the card went mainly to how the shuffling is represented. Want:- Workshop support: Let the community create custom cards and/or campaigns. The game will never die then and keep getting followers.- DLC:s - this game has way more to offer within the already established framework. I'm certain that those who enjoyed it will want more of it.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to try and be as thorough as I can with this review. I've been playing the game since before it was released on steam. I think that now they've made it clear the game is almost finished I'm going to explain why this game is FAR from finished. Let me start out by saying that I'm an old gamer, yeah an old guy still playing games. So, the definition of what was and what is now considered a ROGUE-like are two completely different animals. The old rogue-likes were fun games were you crawled a dungeon in search of treasure and weapons much like the new ones. After that the definition has changed. Old rogue-likes required you to use your wits to advance your character in such a way that you could accomplish your goals as long as you played your cards right ""no pun intended"". The new rogue likes are a smorgasbord of take it up the proverbial gluteus without any way to counter/block/prepare or even chance your way out of a situation. This growing trend of masochistic (why people think it is) enjoyment has literally turned rogue like games that could have been great from games that lasted weeks, months, & years into ones that only last a few hours, days, or weeks. That’s if you're willing to deal with them for that long.This game has (with a quickly closing window of opportunity) great potential. Its play style is great, the graphics are excellent, and the concept is really good. The issue is with the little faults in mechanics that destroy its greatness. The little bits of masochistic garbage that has been added in because of the fan boys that have demanded more challenge.  There are cards that instantly reduce your health by 50% with no way to counter them. Cards that do the same for food, max-health, or take your highest priced item with no way for you to stop it from happening. In 3-4 turns you can go from having 150 health, 60 food, and a good weapon down to having 24 max-health, 6 food, and your weapon stolen. Every one of these things under the frustration of them being uncounterable. I’ve died almost 9/10 times in this… game due to starvation because if you get food you lose food. If you have food it’s instantly screwed over.I’ll come right out and say this, the card shuffling challenges (once again due to whining fan boys) are plain and simply garbage. Yeah sure you can do them at lower levels (maybe level 1-4). After that it becomes a 100% guessing game because the cards move so fast, are undetectable in their sequence when going that fast, and shuffle 2-3 times. The card shuffling is just plain bad. It’s not novel at all, and in my honest opinion it detracts from the game. Aside from that I’m not even sure what they could do to replace it. I understand the frustration of trying to come up with a type of skill challenge were cards are involved, but there has to be something better than a crappy shifting cups knock off. I’ve played the game for some time now hoping they’d come up with something better, or at least improve on the current style. To my dismay it not only didn’t get any better but worse because fan boys asking for the cards to go faster (stating it was to EASY for them to spot the winning cards).This leads me into my next complaint. Multiple people on these forums have asked for game modes (AKA easy, hard, expert, & Masochistic). Apparently the Devs refuse to acknowledge these requests. Who knows, it’s possible that these modes will be added on the final release, but it’s starting to look like the compass isn’t point north on this happening.This game is looking more like a game of luck than a game of skill, and because of that I just can’t endorse it. My heart bleeds for how much I so wished this game wouldn’t become another modern aged rogue-like. Bosses and mobs that Spam the same unblockable attack over and over again. Many of them don’t even give you enough warning to even say you’ve been warned (AKA rat men). Controls that are unresponsive in many cases. Fire shooting Lizard-man that do massive damage to you in one hit if you even miss one of their projectiles.In closing I could go into intricate detail on certain cards that are extremely annoying in this game. Why they literally♥♥♥♥♥♥me off every time I see them, and why they’re the reason this game is more of a chore then a fun experience. Every patch they’ve come out with since its release on steam has fixed some things, but destroyed others. As stated in the beginning this game is FAR from finnished. So much potential in a game from a group of programmers that could have made something extremely great instead of what is starting to look like a money grab that is falling short of its glory because of masochistic fan boys.added 2/12/2015 after morgan's post on 2/10/2015I see that you’re passionate about the game. Hearing that it will eventually have game modes is a good thing. Especially for people that don’t like the over the top “luck based” system that is currently offered. I can see your point that many will consider this a finished product, and so I concede that it can be viewed that way. As far as the taking the money and running quote. I’m sorry, yes I jumped the gun in the heat of the moment of my frustration in writing this review. If there are plans for game fixes in the future after the games release. Along with content updates that will surely fix the cards that will eventually be deemed less than enjoyable by many such as “example: choose to place on top or on bottom” then I will remove my negative post, and wait until a future time to once again try the game. If I may, please make it so (if it’s not being implemented already) mob bosses don’t continually Spam their unblockable attacks. I don’t have a problem with the attacks so much as the constantly having to dodge the entire battle because they chain Spam the ability. Which ends up becoming problematic, repetitive, and less than fun when you have a Jack of Dust, and a King of dust doing nonstop power attacks along with 12 bandits swinging at you in tandem, and 3 of them throwing daggers almost the entire time. Here’s the thing. The keyboard buttons respond better than the joystick buttons do. However, joystick movement is much easier to use than the keyboard. So it’s a toss up. Example, I can counter rat men dart throwers with the keyboard because it responds better even if I’m hit by one of their projectiles. Were as if you get hit by one of the projectiles while using the joystick it’s almost impossible to block the rest of the attacks due to the slow response time of the buttons (In case you’re wondering I’m currently using an Afterglow Xbox 360 controller). Not sure if it's due to my controler or if there’s a fix to this, but it’s extremely frustrating when you get hit by a plethora of darts because you failed to block the first one.In the end I realize I can’t have my cake and eat it too, and that I'm just one voice out of millions that play this game. I’ll stick with you guys as a backer; your response time is well appreciated, and shows you do care, so if people read this post hopefully they’ll read this section. Unless you want me to remove the whole post, in which case if you do, keep this in mind. You might want to make it really clear to people planning on buying this game that it is a heavily luck based system. If anything this is something I want to get across to the buying community. The games concept is awesome, and I commend your team for the work they have done up to this point on the game. I’ll refrain from a refund, and I’ll stick with it. The way I see it I’ve already gotten plenty of hours of game play out of the game, and don’t feel it fair that you guys won’t get paid for the work you’ve already done up to this point.			"

								On the last level my max health was cursed down to 35% and I was damaged to about 5, and THEN I pulled a curse card that disabled any kind of healing. I looked at my food: 1 left. ""♥♥♥♥ it"". I moved to the next card.The next draw was ""Nymphs of the Sweetwoods"", or what I call the ""FEMA Check card"", which removes all curses and blessings, resets your food to 10, removes all gold, and replaces your equipment with the starting equipment from the 1st level.I fought the final boss with a rusty axe and won.10/10			"

												Epic! This game is freaking perfect! From the core mechanics, to the dialogues, writing, music, graphics... EVERYTHING.I can't see myself getting bored of this game. It's entirely randomized everytime you start over, and each choice you make can have a massive effect on the rest of the game.The card system, the inventory management, every single card, even their description, are great.The combat is fun, fast, and fluid. Incredibly responsive and addictive!10/10. Best purchase I've made in years. "

												Deck building & 3rd person brawling… two seemingly disparate styles that play off each other well. It helps if you’ve ever played a deck building game… or any of the Batman Arkham games as the combat style is precisely “Batman with an ax”. Combat is deliberately slow and methodical. Curating you deck is satisfying in that nerdiest of ways(Calculating the ice knife’s slow down effect verses the War Hammer’s added attack strength).  HoF relies a bit to much on the Skinner Box as unlocking tokens and cards is far more engaging than beating the bosses. Also you’ll want to equip the largest helmet you can find because your random viking avatar is the ugliest man… and you have to look at him the whole game. At the start of playing HoF I estimated I’d get about 20 hours out of it and at time of writing I’m at 22. Well worth the money simply for being able to listen to the dealer over and over.			"

												This game brings collection of cards, board games and third person action together with great voice acting and a wonderful atmosphere. I've played through the first third of the story mode and have been enjoying ever step of the way. I'm surprised this game isn't getting more press it is polished and compelling.Now that I've reached end game I have to say that the difficulty curve is a bit much. It's pretty hard to actually beat the game as it becomes necessary to have really lucky card draws since the deck is literality stacked against you and old bosses become frequent random encounters.But it's still lots of fun replaying earlier more balanced battles or endless mode.

												For those who are not aware of what they are getting into, read on otherwise skip this to see the pros and cons. You are allowed to chose cards for 2 decks, encounter and gear. In gear deck you can select cards for weapons, shields, armor, and special attack. In encounter deck you can select cards with monsters or people who might help you. Along with these the dealer mixes in a few cards, beneficial kind such as food, health, coin, boons, etc. as well as harmful ones such as lose health, lose food, lose coin, gain curses, etc. Then levels are generated using all three decks. Some encounters fetch you a token which unlock more cards for your deck.There's a set of cards in each level among which one of them is an exit to next level or boss if it's final level in story mode. Then there's endless mode where you keep going at it until you die and difficulty keeps increasing every level and you get a curse as you progress further. PositivesVariations in dealer deckYour decks are highly customizableEndless mode, difficulty scaling as levels go on is incredibly well doneLots to do in story modeDealer dialogues, some of them are funny others are good, good writing.NegativesGame difficulty can range from very easy to very hard depending on how your luck is, and in some rare cases can even become impossible to beat. It is beatable rest of the times though however hard it might seem. "

												Hand of Fate is a relaxing little game, which deserves to be recommended.Firstly, what is Hand of Fate? The game is somewhat unorthodox, as it is a mixture of genre. It's a ""marriage"" of a card game, a dungeon crawler and an rpg. HoF is mostly a card game, where you create and use your own deck of cards. It's also a dungeon game, the style of ""dungeon master"". You play with the dealer, who reveals the environment before you. A map constitutes of cards and when you move onto the next card you reveal it and face the adventure or the event described on that card. When you face combat, a separate level design opens up, where you move your character freely and fight mobs. The combat system is extremely simple, which is not necessarily a bad thing.What's absolutely fantastic about HoF is the atmosphere created. It's magestic, mysterious, with dim light and a shady dealer commenting on your actions. The game certainly has the wow factor, especially when you first launch it. In a sense, it's eye-candy. The voice acting of the dealer is very well made. The buttons and graphics are excellent, the art on the cards really impressive. The dealer's pot is awesome and that sound when he reaches for the token and closes the pot, the token then hovers in the air avaiting for you to take possession of it. Attention to details is commendable.The game system is very very well balanced. It really is. It's simply, but well thought out. As you make choices, it's all about risk and return. It's simple, it's fun, it's relaxing.On the downside, when you play HoF for some time you realize it is shallow. I hate to say it. You play matches with the dealer and unlock new cards. Then you need to use the cards in practice to learn them. You need to progress in that manner, unlock better equipment to deal with stronger bosses. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Purely repetitive. There is, sadly, nothing more than that in this game.That doesn't change the general recommendation for this game. It's good, it's definiately worth getting and I believe you are guaranteed to enjoy it.I've read that HoF2 is under development. Definialy a good decision. The game has a lot of potential. Let's just hope that they will bring more depth to the game.			"

												I had put this game on my wishlist when it first was released (or bata if there was one) and was one of the games taken off my wishlist during the summer sale. Took another look and watched a gameplay video and it looked interesting. After 5 hours of playing, through 2/3rd of the store and one try at endless I am finding the game quite fun and interesting.I move around a small board of cards and each is an event, a battle, a shop, a game of chance. etc. Need food to move, gold to buy stuff, some events reward you with random equipment/ability/blessing. Or a curse, lose equiment, lose health... etc.When you get a battle event you draw 1-2 monster cards and you fight them. Battles consist of attacking and counter attack when you see green icon, no matter how many monsters only 1 attack (that can be countered) at a time. Some attacks are unblockable and you have to jump out of the way, sometimes at the same time as counterable attacks. So while it can be overwhelming to go against 10+ critters, with enough skill you can win.Many events have a game of chance, 4 cards that have success/fail, they get shuffled and you pick a card. Some say it is possible to follow a card, but I have only been able to follow the card that is on top and shuffled only once.Is if you like the concept of a card game, and hack and slash that is not complicated but fun give this game a try.

Early Access Review
								After playing the FIRST level of this game i was in love. One of the most interesting game concepts i have come across, and was very excited to see it put into practice! You start with very basic cards, which get played face down to form a dungeon. Traversing the dungeon will flip the cards and apply the effects of the card. Your ultimate aim is to find the dungeon boss and defeat them, this unlocks the next boss AND token (booster packs / single cards). After the first few bosses you may actually BUILD a deck, playing through your own custom dungeon! The potential for this game is MASSIVE and i reccomend everyone try it, or at least watch it on youtube / twitch!			"

								8/10This is a fantastic game. It really tries to throw a bunch of different games together, and... It works! It's fun to build your deck and exciting when you pull a rare card you've been just itching to try in your next brawl. The action combat reminds me of the Batman Arkham series, and for the most part, it's fairly smooth sailing. While very basic at times, this game is in fantastic shape in the midst of the broken and dying Early Access titles that flood the catalog. I'd at least keep this on your Wishlist, if I were you.

												Hand Of Fate:~~~~~~~~~~~  Hand Of Fate is an  unique game which combines a fighting (hack-and-slash), role playing and a card game. You will sit at a table opposite this story teller (he reminds me of the evil Jaffar) with his deck of cards and you will be invited to play the game of life and death! You will have to defeat 12 of his champions in the story mode or you can play an endless mode, which is play until you die. Our nice story teller will shuffle the cards at the start of each campaign and you will receive a deck of cards which will have goodies (weapons and armour) and he will also have a deck with plenty of nasty surprises with the objective of bringing you down. You will need to gather food; to use every time you move. Gather money to purchase weapons, to heal yourself, to remove curses or to receive a blessing.When the cards are laid face down on the table, you will be represented by a figurine and you will have to move it to the next card. Upon arriving on the cards you may face a horde of bandits, goblins, ratmen or you might be going to the shop, talking to a priest, finding a treasure chest or even retrieving a weapon from a canyon. The ultimate goal is to go through the deck and kill the champion. Sometimes you will face a challenge (fighting) and if you win, you will receive a token which will give you a unique card to add to your deck for your next campaign.In terms of the controls, the gamepad is the best option in my opinion but you can use the mouse and keyboard if you want to.  All fighting maps are small but fast and challenging. And you will need a good deck of cards and plenty of skills to kill your opponents.Graphically, the game looks great and you can put the resolution up to 2560 X 1440.  The audio is good and the narration is splendid. So, are you ready to play the game of life and death? Your fate lays in a deck of cards ... what hand do you have?Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Unique concept and gameplay-	Fabulous narration-	Great Graphics-	Generate new game after dying-	Runs well-	Challenging-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	I can’t see any!This game is marvellous!10/10 MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												What happens when you combine a rogue-lite dungeon crawler, a deck-building game, and the action elements from Shadow of Mordor together? You get Hand of Fate, a mostly entertaining hodgepodge of ideas held together by beautiful presentation and the luck of the draw.At its core, Hand of Fate is a dungeon crawler. You traverse a number randomly-generated maps, encounter various creatures which either help or hinder or attack you, and pick up incrementally more powerful items to better stave off death in more taxing environs. It’s a design that’s been a staple of games for about as long as there has been an industry, but this is not your father’s dungeon crawler. The folks at Defiant Designs have taken the tried-and-true approach and peppered in more tried and true from other genres, but they have cobbled it all together in a way that is truly unique.Illuminated by a single candle, you’ll initially find yourself sitting across a table from a mysterious stranger known only as The Dealer. He is the narrator, game master, and your primary opponent. Found within his ever-expanding deck of cards are all the encounters, items, quests, and locations that you will discover as you work your way through his call sheet of increasingly powerful enemies.Every level starts the same: you select your deck, and if you so desire you can also select The Dealer’s base deck as well. He will then flavour it with his own special additions, before laying out a rudimentary game map using his cards as grids. As the game progresses, these maps will increase in length and complexity, just as the foes you encounter within become more powerful and more plentiful.To explore a level you move your counter to an adjacent card. This will consume one item of food from your limited supply, and activate the card just landed on. Each card might be a location where you will be tasked with a mini-quest or the choice to explore, an NPC who offers you assistance based on how you respond to their questions, or an such as a weapon, armour, or something a little more exotic. There are also merchants to trade with and various types of enemy to battle.There are a surprisingly large number of unique cards in Hand of Fate, and the random nature of each map keeps things fresh – until the later stages of the game at least. Every level or dungeon offers a different challenge, and while the final bosses start off rather simple, they do become more and more challenging the deeper in the deck you travel.The deck-building side of the game is a little rudimentary. You unlock new cards by completing quests and earning tokens from special cards, and once a level has been completed, these tokens are traded for new cards that you can add to your deck and then your hand for subsequent levels. These cards vary from items to unique events to encounters, and the idea is to stack your deck as best you can to counter anything The Dealer may throw at you.By its nature it’s all very reactive though, and as you have no control over when each card can be played, the ability to actively counter an opponent’s play is absent. That’s a shame – it feels like a missed opportunity to add another strategic element to the metagame.However, Hand of Fate might just be one of the most instantly-atmospheric games this reviewer has ever encountered. The dank, dimly-lit room and single table is suitable dingy, and The Dealer is wonderfully detailed, animated, and voiced. In fact, the presentation of the game as a whole is quite an achievement, and demonstrates not only the talent that Defiant Designs possesses, but also its attention to detail and obvious passion for the project.The cards themselves are wonderfully detailed with an art style reminiscent of adventure game books from the ‘80s and ‘90s, and any fan of Fighting Fantasy or Lone Wolf will see the obvious inspiration painted on the card faces. These touches help to give depth to the game world and move it past its very gamey roots.Sadly, Hand of Fate does lose its lustre after about the midway point. The combat is a simplified derivative of the Batman Arkham system, so the move list is rather limited, and after games like Shadow of Mordor, it feels very shallow.Mechanically it’s sound, but the one area where the lack of budget shows is in the animations for combat. There is a lack of weight behind attacks, and the dodges and counters feel floaty and work against the flow of combat. As the difficulty begins to peak in the final levels, this lack of reactivity reduces the combat to a messy, mashy misfire more often than not.Even so, Hand of Fate is greater than the sum of its parts, not to mention half the price of the aforementioned games at launch. It only really becomes tedious down the stretch, when repetition sets in and the combat grows stale. Until then, it's a unique concoction with a wonderfully lively Dealer and some interesting ideas.			"

												This is a game of risk-assessment, combined with a little deck-building,  action, and a little ""three cups"" (expect with cards).The fact that the developers have been regularly updating it with content -free of charge- is an enormus bonus. I am sure this game had like 3 content upgrades since I've bought it, that other publishers would have tried to sell me as DLC.I must admit; the story ending is sorta lack-luster. This usually wouldn't even worth mention in a rouge-like game, it's just this game builds so heavily -and well- on narration, that I found it weird to end it in such way.			"

												Got it on the last day of the EA, and I do not regret it one bit. There is way too much that this game does well and only 2 things that it does poorly. But first, I just have to do this:- Was entirely unlucky, got failures at almost everything, including the treasure chest - but for the evil carnival, I got 2 huge successes there- Got down to 2 health and got the close shave achievement- Went down to 10 HP with no food, got ambushed and restocked- Went down to 5 HP and got a shop- Entered the Scales boss battle with only 35 HP.- Then killed the stompy stompy tail lizard and his band, all of this one the same level.10/10 will try my luck again - and I will go play the lottery too now cause this was like 1/100. BRB.Back. Now what does this game does well and what poorly.(EDIT: I think I could have been less excited and more informative about the game. I am sorry, I was way too hyped. So here goes...)Foreword: this is a card collection game, unlike any other. Here you do not use cards to fight - the cards represent actions or encounters. In essense, the cards fight you - or help you. In the beginning of the level, a maze of cards is laid out in front of you, which you must traverse to the end, which results in entering another area (different card layout) or a boss battle. And of course, to make your life even more miserable, you have food, gold, equipment and life points. Food needs to be replenished at a regular basis, or you will start losing life points and die of starvation. Gold is used in shops and random events, equipment and life points are used in battles. To make the long read short short you have:- Random events - ranging from quests to finding a treasure chest or running a gauntlet to it- Fights - there is a number of encounters you need to fight through, including a boss at the end of the level who play in a 3D Batman/Assassin's Creed style- Shops and helpful NPCs who will give you buffs or foodGood:1. No 2 games are the same, even if you play the campaign. Decks determine playthroughs, not scenarios.2. Winning a whole encounter and beating up the boss of a level with a starter rusty axe has never been more satisfying.3. Building a deck matters, molding it to your liking even moreso.4. Some people complain about the slowmo attacks, but it is exactly these that give you a good view of the battlefield.5. Mashing buttons can both win or lose you the game. Cool. Makes gamers learn something.Bad:1. Bind the camera to buttons, people. You have both tabs unused, make it like Dynasty Warriors 8 and you will be golden. While I agree that you can't see behind your back and it adds a realistic combat, rogue-like games are punishing as they are by default.2. Boss battles become a bit repetitive once you learn how the bosses work and what is their attack sequence.Semi-bad: this game is best played with a controller. I hope you have one. My RAZR is doing a magnificent job with it.Buy the game on this last day of the early access and enjoy it. You don't have much time left, and the free first DLC is just an added bonus.			"

												TL;DR: Brilliant game, buy it at full price along with DLC.  Combination hack/slack with RPG and card game.Absolutely brilliant game!  I normally don't write reviews until I've finished a game, but the ending has proven a bit too challenging for me so far.  Graphics are above bar and sound is excellent.  Voice actor is just wonderful, totally sells it and really creates the wanted ambience.  It isn't roguelike, and I hate when people misuse that word.  It is in no way roguelike.  Choices matter, but death is not permanent.  Gameplay is very clever.  The rules are simple without being overly repetitive, and there is a lot of learning by doing.  The rules of the game are explained over time and some only through mistakes, which makes the choices interesting.  Difficulty level is just right, I think...I'm a casual gamer and I haven't yet completed the game on normal difficulty.Please give this studio your business, and let's hope they come up with more winners like Hand of Fate!

												Great fun without being exceptionally deep. Hand of Fate is original, atmospheric, and certainly a worthy buy. The combat sequences can be a bit repetitive after long periods of play but this is meant to be more of a pick it up when you want 15mins to half an hour of fun game than an engrossing (and some might say long winded) story driven adventure. It IS an adventure nonetheless and no playthrough is ever quite the same. The dialogue and voice acting of the dealer is unsurpassed and does a fine job of creating that atmosphere I mentioned. Don't get too distracted by the words ""card game"". It's not what you would expect if you do. Despite the fact that it becomes very challenging in later play most gamers will have little trouble completing the story mode within about twenty hours. There is also a fairly entertaining ""endless"" mode though and this is one you could come back to any time you feel the urge. Perfect for ""casual"" play when you want a break from anything too substantial.			"

												While there are definitely a handful of things that could improve the game, the experience as a whole is a very cool, unique, and fun game play concept that hasn't really been done before, and for that I very much look forward to future installments. The execution is very clean, from the music, voice acting, card design, environment, etc. Some of the issues are with the mechanics though, like the inability to rotate the camera in battle, how the ""counter"" system works, and other foundation level things like that.My one main complaint was the lack of a feeling of progression as you go through the levels. Every single level, you start with basically the same default gear. Sure it upgrades as you progress, but the point being, there isn't any of the enjoyment/excitement/satisfaction of finding new loot, at least in the traditional sense. You may get a card for a new awesome weapon, but there is a good chance you won't get to use it any time soon, or technically speaking, you could make it through the rest of the game without getting a particular equipment card that you've unlocked. Because of that, I don't really view this as much of an RPG, instead it's more of fantasy game wrapped around an action framework.All and all, I loved the fresh approach, and many aspects of the game, enough that I would in fact recommend it.

												Lovely game in two parts. Part one is a card game with a dungeon crawl theme. Part two, when the card game throws up a battle, is a lovely 3D fighting game in the vein of Shadow of Mordor. Instantly accessible in its simplicity it gives even none-twitch-skill gamers like me plenty of chance to develop strategies and have fun.I'm a Linux gamer and can report this plays perfectly with excellent frame rates on that platform.Review summary in one word: Luuuuuverly.

												Hands of Fate is a choose your adventure style of game mixed with high stakes gambling in the form of the cards of fortune except instead of money the player's life is on the line.Pros:+Gameplay:Standard gameplay has the player move around on a set of adventure cards sometimes you're lucky and find a ""Maiden of Good Fortune"",which will supply the player with much needed supplies, while other times you may find yourself ambushed by bandits and the like. +Characters:Never found myself bored when playing against the dealer as his snarky comments whenever something unfortunate happened only encouraged me to keep going and beat him down.+Atmosphere:The game does a good job of setting up emotions as you traverse through to find the boss while you're desperately looking for any scraps of food and slowly see yourself losing more and more health until finally you find the final boss and get immediately♥♥♥♥♥♥slapped to death as you only had 5 hp left.+/-Artwork:Unfortunately no customization for your hero's features only equipment will make him look different.As for the enemies they're all easily identifiable but there isn't much variation with looks besides the boss fights.Cons:-Soundtrack:Nothing really noticeable standard music will play while you move,fight and encounter the final boss. It's nice, but nothing particularly interesting.-Combat:When you do get down and fight the game ""attempts"" to have a Batman style of fighting, with combos and counters, but I do mean ""attempts"" as it's easily exploited and very,very lenient.What I mean is that by the time the counter signal is sent and by the time I actually have to counter, I could easily leave the keyboard,go to the kitchen and make myself a sandwich, get a drink, and then comeback to actually press Q. Also, once you have a shield you can easily just right click to victory because any enemy caught in your way can't move at all and will only occasionally break out of their stun,so if you want to beat this game easily just Captain America anyone in your way.-RNG:A large portion of this game is decided by picking 4 cards sometimes you can get super lucky(large chunk of gold with a weapon) and sometimes you can get super unlucky(lose health and a permanent part of your total health). If you don't like RNG deciding gameplay*cough*Yogg-Stone*cough* then this can be frustrating.Especially at later portions of the game where I found myself trying to avoid RNG as much as possible so I can have the largest amount of health to fight the final boss.Final Verdict:(7/10)If you like gambling and a slower version of Batman's combat then this is the game for you.If not, pick this game up when it's on sale.

												What drew me towards this game was the aesthethics and atmosphere shown in the trailers, and I was not disappointed.The game is presented as you, the protagonist, sitting across from the dealer, a mysterious hooded figure, to play game of cards.Everything in the game has a representation as a playing card. The playing field is a bunch of cards, laid out in small mazes.Your equipment is made up of cards like weapons, helms, shields and a plethora of rings. Your enemies are cards in 4 suites (dust, skulls, scales and plague), each of which is a theme (e.g. the card ""2 of dust"" is a pair of bandits).The cards are sorted into various stacks and decks, the most important two are the equipment deck, from which you draw your rewards; and the encounter deck, from which the playing field is drawn.The encounter deck shapes the way the game plays out, which is a mix of ""choose your adventure"" style events, and combat situations. ""Choose your adventure"" & Overworld gameplay Between encounters you move your figure between cards, one per turn. As you step onto a card it is revealed, and the dealer narrates the events that ensue, while you decide how you act in the situation.There is a wide range of different situations presented here, some result in combat, some might draw you cards from the pain deck (punishments, if your decisions or luck are bad) or the gain deck (food, gold, health, equipment).On some encounters you play for a token, which represents one (or more!) cards to unlock for future rounds.Aside from your inventory, you have health, food and gold as resources, all of which are important. On each turn, you consume 1 food, which heals you, unless you have no food, in which case you begin to starve. This quickly results in death, and means that you should plan a few turns ahead. And maybe not spend all your gold on shiny rings, but good instead. Combat & Controls Whenever you enter combat mode, you enter the world in third person mode and do battle against the monster cards the dealer has drawn for you.Controls are fairly simple, left stick to move around, and the actions at your disposal are ""attack"", ""counter"" (if you have a shield), ""weapon ability"" and ""use artifact"" (usually buffs or area effect attacks)While this may appear shallow at first, it becomes rather taxing once there are more than a few enemies on screen, some of which may have ranged or special attacks, or block your attacks.I played with a controller and felt the game controlled very smoothly. I did not try mouse/keyboard at all, so cannot make a statement about it. Progression, Attrition & Deck building elements After you beat the tutorial, the dealer reveals to you that there are 12 champions (the ""royal"" cards of the suites, Jacks, Queens and Kings) for you to defeat. As you progress through the game you unlock many new equipment and encounter cards. Out of these you build 2 decks which the rounds are based on.But as you gain more cards, the dealer also inserts his own cards into the encounter deck, the pain deck and of course the monster deck from which your opponents are pulled.In one session you will usually accrue a number of items making combat easier for you, but to balance it out, you will also take damage, consume resources and later might be struck by one or more of the dealer´s nasty curse cards. These serve as a means of hampering your progress, to not make it too easy for you. They range from basic debuffs (e.g. starvation causes more damage) to severe restrictions (e.g. you can not sell items, or ""the more gold you carry, the slower you move""), putting you into interesting predicaments. Attrition, difficulty and long term fun Death is permanent, but especially in the beginning of the game you will mostly emerge from a round with several newly unlocked cards, as such, frustration is kept to a minimum.Unlocking new cards is a strong incentive to keep playing, as many of the cards are interesting, and the encounter cards often form little story arcs.I beat the game after about 20 hours, meaning I defeated all of the champions.After beating the main game, there is also an endless mode, in which you dont construct a deck, but have all of your unlocked cards available (and so has the dealer, that sinister man.)There were a few difficulty spikes (mostly the Jack of Scales and the King of skulls for me), but nothing too bad. Graphics, Sound & atmosphere As mentioned before, the art style and graphics, as well as the beautiful music (with an oriental touch) serve to craft a very nice atmosphere.The sinister musings of the dealer are often interesting (tough they repeat after a while, but not to the point where they are annoying) Gripes While I can heartily recommend the game, there are a few gripes & nitpicks I have, which I will list here, in case they are a show-stopper to you: Some of the cards seem rather imbalanced, some equipment feel too strong (2 of the rings, I won´t spoil which) and some enemy encounters can stop a round quite early (The kraken especially, but at least it´s a card that you unlock rather late) In-game advertising for the DLC (extra characters, which are basically game modifieres), achievements which can only be done with the DLC.  The DLC is only ""okay"" Endless mode starts out a bit slow, the first 2-3 floors are usually a cakewalk Sometimes the combat can be a bit repetitive, more so if you aim for maximum unlocks/achievementsOur hero´s deadly sin is gluttony, seriously, one food per turn, learn some restraint!

												Hand of Fate took my interest a while back when it was on Early Access so I put it on my wishlist.  Now it's on sale and with Steam's newly implemented refund system online I thought I would give it a go and I'm very glad I did!To watch the gameplay videos does not do this game an ounce of justice, especially if you watch one from the beginning of the game and the reason for this is also one of it's biggest strengths.  Hand of Fate does a fantastic job of teaching by doing; there are no 'press 1 to feel' tutorials here, you enter the game and press start and before you know it you're already playing.  The first run is short and gives you a good idea about what the game is about but without smothering you in advanced rules and options and things you won't remember later on.For the whole game you sit opposite a nefarious looking fellow akin to a games master, he draws cards for you and tells the story.  You simply have to choose the path you travel through the level and deal with each card as you land on it.  It may be an encounter you enter where you must fight (more on combat below), a series of traps you must negociate or a tradiditional text based quandry to muse over, where the outcome is determined by blind choosing one of four cards.  The likelyhood of being successful is often directly related to your gear, i.e. it's easier to cross a river in light armour than heavy so more of the four cards will give success and fewer failure.As I alluded to previously simply watching the gameplay and combat videos do this game a great misjustice, hack and slash is not terrbily exciting to watch and the very reason you are fighting is lost.  You cannot possibly know the tension created by this being your penultimate fight before the boss of the level, that the card before was a goblin card and they stole your shield and that prior to which was a merchant card where you sold your spare shield.  The story that goes along with each encounter really enriches the combat, which really only makes up a portion of the game on the whole anyway.Finally there is the hearthstone-esque component of Hand of Fate; each time you complete a run you unlock more cards.  There are 3 decks, equipment for yourself (just because you choose to put a fancy new hammer in your deck doesn't mean you will ever draw it - just like in HS where you may be desperate for that flamestrikebut not draw it), modifiers to your character (flavour cards that add boons and debuffs and add great variety to playthroughs) and finally encounters.  When you get new cards you have to experience them in the game to see what they actually do (equipment included) so often you pick new cards with a hint of trepidation.  As you become more powerful and add more of your own cards so must you also add more cards for the game master to play and the enemies also grow in power and variety.In closing I have played this game for 2 hours and felt compelled to write a fairly detailed review in the hopes it might urge others to try this fantastic game.  Worst case you play for just less than 2 hours and ask for a refund if it's not for you, best case you enjoy this gem as much as I did.			"

												This game is a card game.  It is a resource management game.  It is a brawler. It is a text based, classic adventure game. It is a RPG and a rogue-like. This game is phenomenal, I thoroughly enjoyed my short time with it so far.I played but just 1 hour of Hand of Fate, I closed the game and instantly came to write this piece.  If you are like me and you like a good RPG, choose your own adventure or anything vaguely close to fantasy, I feel you will appreciate the direction that this game embarked upon.Hand of Fate handles the tutorial with such finesse that I wasn’t even aware it was a tutorial until it had come to a end – I was already invested In my character and in my story.When you first boot up the game it will launch you directly in to the “game of life and death”, as is so aptly described by the card dealer. You will proceed to get comfortable at the fortune teller-esque table and Gothic surroundings with a inexplicably cryptic figure who welcomes you to the game of life and death. We do not know who the card dealer is, but you will get a sense of power and mystique as he shuffles the deck. Very quickly you will come to realise that Hand of Fate is not a run-of-the-mill card game, it is that and so much more.The premise is to advance through each area and kill the twelve different heroes, that are under the guidance of the quippy card dealer.  The dealer will lay several cards in front of you on to a table, where you will take control of a game piece, just like in a board game. To advance you must move the game piece on to the different cards and watch the game unfold, for every card you move to one piece of food will be consumed – manage these resources very carefully. Each card brings with it its own adventure and riches, its own danger and fortunes, will you be brave and save the Captain of the Guard or leave him to the fate of the Undead?Defeating a hero card can be rewarding and in some cases, difficult.  With them, hero cards draw different monster cards from the deck that will place them in to the battle, increasing its difficulty. Once a hero is defeated, the game is over and you will be able to use any card tokens that you obtained throughout your journey to unlock more cards.Unlocking cards will allow you to customize your deck to your liking, just like any other collectible card game. If you are not in to fiddling about with so many cards, or are inexperienced with creating card decks, there is a option to create a deck optimized for you – Which the game will do for you.The tone is set from the exact moment you launch the game – it is dark, it is mysterious and it is Gothic. The art direction for this title is spot on, everything just fits in to place, even the cards are designed in such an intricate way they left me feeling that I was really sitting at the table playing this game. The burning candle flickering over the game table sets the perfect mood for a stare-down with a hooded, mystic figure. I would love to be able to buy myself a physical copy of the cards.I genuinely cared for the actions that I took.  I wanted to save the Captain of the Guard, I wanted to loot the goblin cave and plunder its riches and I felt it necessary to make a deal with the devil. I delved in to reading each card and the tales it brought with it.  My hero was a holy-mace wielding, bandit slaying, guard saving badass and I loved it. I wanted to make sure that he had the gear I wanted him to have; maybe not necessary the best gear, but the gear that I believed fit in to his persona. This was a pen and paper RPG at its finest.Did I mention that this game is a brawler?  No?  Well it is.  When the cards are down and the candle flickers, when playing the game of life and death and inhaling the musky atmosphere, expect to kill or be killed. Combat is not turn based – It is not handled like a card game nor is it RPG-like.  I would forgive you for thinking that combat happens like that of a text-based adventure game, but you would be wrong. You, your character and all of the gear you have amassed will be teleported in to a 3D environment along with the monster cards that were drawn, and you will fight.  Combat is much like the Arkham series, but feels less polished.  It is obvious that this was not meant to be the games strong point – And that is okay.  It works and It fits in with the game, hell, at this point what doesn’t?Within 1 hour of gameplay I had created a character that I was entirely invested in and cared about. He had saved the Captain of the Guard who provided us with his powerful Mace masked in a Holy boon to ward off the Undead. I had met a Fair Maiden who blessed me with life longevity by providing me with a +5 health boost. I encountered Mister Lionel, a Goblin disguised as a old man who mysteriously appeared a shield right in front of my face, as a gift. I had scaled the winding vines of a canyon as a glistening metal caught my eye – I had found a sword. The Maze Of Traps had been conquered and the gold plundered. I defeated the Devil’s challenge before looting a Dead King’s Tomb for +10 Max health, food and riches. I was no longer playing as a character in a video game, I was me and I was creating a story.Hand of Fate is fantastic and if you have a vested interest in RPG’s, card games or fantasy I highly suggest that you give this game a go.  It is something different that tries and succeeds in covering many different game genres. This game is a gem that I was not expecting, I had no idea that this game was being released and I am glad I paid a measly £15 for this phenomenal title.  I know for certain I have only scratched at the surface of this game and I need to get back to playing more.For more like this, head to XB92AI.com "

								Absolutely recommended. I've been playing the game for some time, and I'm loving every minute of it. The ability to design your own dungeon and then run it is fantastic, and seeing if your luck holds out works great as well. The Arkham-style combat works well, and allows the game to mob you while still having a chance to fight back. I'm looking forwards to seeing how it continues.			"

												A truly unique game and experience, Hand of Fate is part rogue-like RPG with choose-your-own-adventure elements, part Assassin's Creed, Arkham style brawler, and part tabletop deck building game. The game lets you choose your own paths and craft your own story, and no two games are ever alike. A witty and snarky card dealer who sits across the table narrates much of your journey and adds his own personal commentary to the decisions you make and the fates that befall you.The music is great, it's incredibly atmospheric and sets the stage and mood quite nicely. The voice acting is fantastic, the number of cards is large and varied, and the aesthetic is all around perfect.The combat system is the only problem the game suffers, and even then it still works well. At times the animations can be a bit stiff and janky and there isn't much depth to it, but at the end of the day it's a nitpick to an overall fantastic game and experience. If you enjoy rogue-likes, choose-your-own-adventures, deck builders, and story telling, pick this up.			"

												I do not recommend this game at the current moment, but perhaps for a steam summer sale. The game starts out quite enjoyable although the combat is quite clunky you can overlook it, marvel at what appears to be a game with depth lying infront of you. But then the later part of the game arrives, things that were expected are not fullfilled since the depth you expected from the deck construction is infact increadibly limited for both equipment and encounters. The clunkyness of the combatsystem shines through and you become a hit and run spamming buffoon in a crowded area(many of the encounter maps are small and you face about 8-16 monsters, its seriously so cramped). Want to buy it for the gameplay? Not worth it(if you find the hit&run around edges fun wait for a sale).Buy it for the depth? No there is none.However the base idea of the game is solid, it just fell short.			"

												This game is awsome.  The dialogue of the Dealer is fun and entertaining.  He sometimes repeats dialogue he has said before, but he has enough diferent things to say asociated to diferent cards that it isn't grating.  The dificulty grows as you progress through the game and although you will start dying more it adds to the fun.  Finding new cards to add to your deck is always fun and some cards are harder to win than others.  I plan to keep playing this after I unlock everything because endless mode is just as fun as Story mode.			"

												Hand of Fate has a very unique approach to action RPG. As the player, you will find yourself sitting at a table and across the table you will find a robed individual with rather large hands. This masked man has plucked and manipulated your very memories in order to set the stage. Cards are used to construct levels, provide gear, health, or pain. Part story, part combat this game brings both worlds together to give the player a interesting taste of the characters life through the dealer's eyes. The player progresses through the game by moving from the starting position to the stairs, cave, boat or basically the exit point for that level. With each move the player consumes one food. If you do not have food than the player loses 10 health. Each move delivers a new encounter for the player as he lands on a card. These cards are determined by what cards were included by the player and the cards added by the dealer. There are more player cards than dealer cards for the campaign. The encounters can be everything from rat men, humans, skeletons to an old woman that asks the player to bring her husband home.The combat system is rather simple. Counter green indicators, dodge red ones and use shield bash to get past their block. Melee is confined to one button and feels  semi fluid. Weapons and items will give you special abilities, but it appears that only weapons will influence combat. For some reason if you do not have a shield you will not be able to see when to counter or dodge the enemy. With each boss run feeling slightly different, it improves the idea of playing more or even endless mode. For additional details click the link below!

For the sake of brevity..Genre tags: Rogue-like(esk), Card Game, Hack n Slash Value Proposition: I don't think it's worth full price. However it has some really interesting ideas that I think are worth investigating. Look for a sale. BSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Normally I'd write a bunch of games with similar mechanics or have a similar ”feeling” in this section for comparison but I can't think of any that would represent it in any sort of genuine manner. I just can't find a reason to be truly sardonic I'm afraid. This is essentially a clunky hack n slash with the tired Batman combat that lies underneath a rogue like card game with deck building. The fighting aspect acts as more of a.. lets call it a controlled dice roll to solve events created by the card encounters.Concomitant Exposition and SummationHand of Fate is novel in concept, if only slightly poorly executed. Just off kilter enough to make it not super enjoyable for repeated attempts. Given the nature of it being a rogue like that probably isn't the best direction to go in. Now, it's only sort of a rogue like; it isn't really a rogue lite either. (I know, genre stuff--super fun) It behaves much more like something in between. There are campaigns to go on but these essentially equate to choosing an enemy or final boss at the beginning of a dungeon and trying to get there afterward by pulling encounter cards vaguely “Guild of Dungeoneering” in this regard. Albeit, with much less engineering.  You build each deck that you enter the dungeon with; the gamemaker lets call him, has his own deck and cards are drawn from each to create the dungeon itself and also provide all other aspects therein. For example: Equipment, Blessings and Curses, and Encounters among other things. It's sort of contrived in that there is a definite progression in each dungeon regardless of the deck. One odd thing however is when building your deck you have the option to manipulate equipment cards AND encounter cards. It sort of feels like you have your hands in both pots. Due to the nature of knowing the encounter cards intimately you can use them to manipulate what the gamemaker throws at you giving you an advantage.  He even comments about this as you play occasionally. The main problem is, the game can feel TOO formulaic. Dungeons become repetitive almost immediately as new encounter cards are earned only through earning the token attached to the encounter card by successfully completing the event of previous encounter cards. This is where the real rogue-esk feeling comes from. Not the separate campaigns. Once the token is earned it breaks open in a very slow and dopamine filled reveal animation. The cards are set up in very Mercenaries 1 sort of way wherein the suits and numbers that correlate to types of enemies and higher up more specific enemies. On top of all that there is the real time combat-- or, as I like to think, the Card Game is the main draw and the fighting is the unique injection to set it apart. Problem is, its extremely clunky. It's the Batman/Shadow of Mordor combat that depressingly has become a standard. It is functional at its very best and can feel even more cumbersome depending on what equipment/blessing/curse cards you may or may not have. Hit detection is weird, movement speed is weird, though this is highly variable due to the cards, animation is clunky and unsatisfying BUT, as I said-- the card game is the main draw. I often avoided fighting if given the option or decided to fight to make should the odds not be in my favor as it really isn't that challenging without a ton of variables stacked against you.  THE GISTIt's a game that when its parts combine resemble something relatively unique. But not terribly interesting in practice. All things said, I think its worth testing those ideas out yourself if only for the sake of research.Follow my curation page for more. "

If you're STILL on the fence, wait for the sequel to fix the combatI had a LOT of fun with Hand of Fate. Expanding and customizing your deck of equipment and encounter cards is great. Some cards have very finnicky or downright unfair requirements to unlock them, but this FTL-esque difficulty makes it that much more satisfying to edit your deck to max out your slim chances. The dealer who runs the game is like a snarkier version of The Merchant from Resident Evil 4. He has a clever quip for everything, and I never got sick of hearing his lines, even after I had played the game so much that I'd heard most of them twenty times before. (Nothing makes getting a good piece of equipment satisfying like his comment, ""I made that a little too powerful..."").The reason I do NOT recommend Hand of Fate (if you're still not sure if this is worth your time and money) is that the core of the game is a really sloppy copy of the Batman games' combat. Combat feels clunky. The camera can't be rotated, leading to all sorts of frustration. Cannon fodder enemies take too many hits to kill, and they don't have any visual indication that they've taken damage, making it VERY frustrating to figure out which of the dozen identical-looking lizardmen you're fighting only needs one more hit to die. You also aren't shown any numbers for how much damage you're doing to enemies, which is particularly frustrating for one of the final boss fights where it is not NEARLY obvious enough that his minions are invincible as long as he's alive.To make matters worse if your computer is old, there are no separate graphic settings for the combat (where getting a smooth frame rate is crucial) and the card map (where frame rate is irrelevant) so going with ""low"" quality textures so that you can actually win fights makes the cards on the map almost illegible.Hand of Fate 2 is coming out later in 2017, and it looks like it will dramatically improve the combat, so you should probably just wait for it instead of struggling with the flawed original.

												While there are definitely a handful of things that could improve the game, the experience as a whole is a very cool, unique, and fun game play concept that hasn't really been done before, and for that I very much look forward to future installments. The execution is very clean, from the music, voice acting, card design, environment, etc. Some of the issues are with the mechanics though, like the inability to rotate the camera in battle, how the ""counter"" system works, and other foundation level things like that.My one main complaint was the lack of a feeling of progression as you go through the levels. Every single level, you start with basically the same default gear. Sure it upgrades as you progress, but the point being, there isn't any of the enjoyment/excitement/satisfaction of finding new loot, at least in the traditional sense. You may get a card for a new awesome weapon, but there is a good chance you won't get to use it any time soon, or technically speaking, you could make it through the rest of the game without getting a particular equipment card that you've unlocked. Because of that, I don't really view this as much of an RPG, instead it's more of fantasy game wrapped around an action framework.All and all, I loved the fresh approach, and many aspects of the game, enough that I would in fact recommend it. In hindsight, I wish I had got it on sale for $10-15, but have enjoyed the experience of it all.			"

												A surprisingly fun game.By over 80% of the playtime you basically play a single player 3D clone of ""Talisman"" with a charismatic Dealer who serves maybe not as your opponent but more like a narrator or generally speaking - a game master.  He is responsible for creating a randomly shaped path builded with  covered random cards for your advancing pawn. Each move of the represenation of your hero means one random event happening to you. Mostly it's just an adventure text quest with A,B,C-type decisions based on luck or wise choice. However sometimes ""stepping on"" the card triggers a combat sequence against multiple aggressors. In this phase the game changes drastically because now you are not only reading the text and wishing for a good karma but actively participate in a visalisation of the event by controling your ""pawn hero"" in hack&slash minigame environment with a very fluid and enjoyable fighting system based on freeflow mechanics (known from Assassins Creed or Batman:Asylum series).Taking the ""matters into yours own hands"" is a nice gateway because only reading the text and listening to the Dealer could make you drowsy after a longer session. You can choose the difficulty of these fights however take in mind that combat can get really challenging and perhaps even frustrating on Hard mode.If I could choose major drawbacks of this title ... well: you can't customize a physical appearance of the hero. You always play as a bearded and mohawk hair-styled warrior who doesn't look differently than other human mobs you are fighting with. This kinda sucks but at least all equippable items like armors or helmets are visible on character so it helps to set your hero apart from other human enemies. And the flaw connected with the combat:Framerate sometimes get choppy when you fight with more than dozen opponents but that's a ""beauty"" of used Unity engine. So to sum up it's an innovative, enjoyable and balanced mix of board game with a real-time action sequences. It's worth trying expecially if you are ""Talisman: The Magical Quest"" game fan.			"

												Some roguelike games are great because they offer a unique set of mechanics (like Desktop Dungeons).  Others are great because they present themselves so well (like Rogue Legacy).  But Hand of Fate does everything well.  Hand of Fate is polished, deep, accessible, and rewarding both for the casual player interested in a unique game and the hardcore collector who wants to get every achievement.  Even when grinding for some of the more difficult cards available, I've never stopped enjoying the experience, the rich theming of the dealer's grim narration or the surprises of certain windfalls or turns of fate.Hand of Fate is a rogue-like wrapped in a deckbuilding game.  As you progress, you unlock cards which represent weapons or equipment as well as enemies and encounters.  All together, these form your ""decks"" - the equipment you'll find available in shops and as random rewards, as well as what monsters or towns or characters you'll meet along the way.  As a result, there are multiple levels of strategy at play throughout the game as you decide which encounters are most rewarding, whether to include high-risk, high-reward cards or cards that consistently yield some small benefit.  Collecting these cards and building decks of rewarding encounters and a strong arsenal of weapons and armor will be the core of your experience.But where Hand of Fate really shines is in its presentation.  The card-as-fate metaphor persists throughout, making for a surprisingly immersive game, even as it transitions between the navigation of your pawn from encounter to encounter and the Arkham-style combat instances in which you'll fight a variety of interesting enemies, each with its own set of different attacks and powers.  I'm reminded on the one hand of the old Lost Kingdoms games for Gamecube; on the other, of the grim atmosphere of Demon's Souls or Dark Souls; and also of FTL, with its emphasis on careful decision-making as you explore deeper and deeper into the unknown.Bottom-line, it's the best-looking, deepest rogue-like I've played to date.  It looks good, plays well, and has tons of content, even at the $25 tag.  If you're even remotely interested, get it.  You may be surprised - you won't be disappointed.			"

Early Access Review
								I had too much fun with this game, so I felt like I should write this review.I had very hard time, deciding if I should buy this game or not. Now I am happy, that I did.I fully recommend this game, if you:1. Enjoy ""rouge""-like systems, when you should go many runs deeper and deeper inside the game, some times lucky, some times not, to begin to understand what's happening or ""get a hand of it"".2. Enjoy building your experience by your own hands. You build 2 decks each time (except endless mode, which is just using all of your cards). First deck is equipment, that you will get chance to get, second is encounter deck. Got sick of unfair encounter? Just get rid of it. Or push your luck to limits to overcome it and get new equipment or encounter cards in return.3. Enjoy indirect storytelling. (When you get information about the world, characters and things that happen - piece by piece, finding new names or view on things by reading or hearing vague descriptions or remarks, and you are 100% free to try and put them together in a way, that will make sense.) I got tons of fun, while doing this.I thinks that you should go look for other alternatives, if you:1. Do not enjoy reading and prefer to skip any available dialog - ""Just get me to action already, dammit!"" You still can play this game, no problem, but will miss half the fun, and knowing that there are a lot of monster-slashing brawlers out there, I can assure you that if you just wasnt to slash some monsters go play something else, you will have more fun there.2. Do not enjoy increasing level of hardships you should deal with, further you play. Number of ""freebies"" will ultimately decrease, longer you play and hardships will only rise, will it be amounts of rewards or just chances of winning an encounter. Do not expect a ""free ride"" from start to finish.3. Can't handle simple action combat system, in which you should dodge or block of break guard at least from time to time. It is not just card game, or turn-base strategy, for more relaxing and meditative experience go somewhere else.			"

												There is a feeling you get on discovering a new world that cannot be duplicated. Like stepping through the wardrobe, falling down the rabbit hole, or having been spat in the eye by a Hobgoblin; when you first see the curtain drop, and the landscape come into focus, excitement akin to Christmas morning overtakes all other senses.  Such was my experience long ago when, on a whim, I picked up Suikoden II at my local flea market. To me it looked like your average game at the time. Pixel graphics. Promise of amazing story on the back. I had no great expectations.  I've never been more wrong in my life.  As many who love RPGs have found, the Suikoden series is one of the best if not THEE best in the history of the genre. When I popped that disc into my old PS1 and heard the opening, named my avatar, and within the first hour was betrayed?! Hah! I was eight years old again, unopened red an green boxes sat before me under the tree.  Fast forward about 15 years and that same jolt of excitement strikes again. This time in the form of an indie game I picked up on Steam called 'Hand of Fate'. Brought to us by Defiant Development - a small Studio based in Brisbane, Australia - greenlit by the Steam community, and funded on Kickstarter; the game could not be more Indie if you gave it a whip and put it above a pit of snakes.  55,000 dollars was all it took to see this masterpiece come into being. A drop in the bucket compared to the triple A titles being produced these days. Yet, as I play the game, I don't notice the difference. The voice acting is superb, the graphics are breath taking, and the combat animations are so satisfying you feel like yelling out, ""GET REKT!!"" whenever your shield connects with an NPC's face. What truly makes this game stand out however is not the RPG elements, nor the brawling. No, they are but two of the ingredients Deviant Development decided to toss in the pot. You also have a table top experience that's like a Tarot card reading mixed with Magic the Gathering. Deck building that reminds you more of 'choose your own adventure' books. Mazes reminiscent of classic dungeon crawlers. With all of it wrapped in a game of luck to the style of 'choose your card, any card'.  Most of the deaths I've had in game has been due to choosing the wrong card and having my health eaten away. Or my food depleted, adding to the RPG experience of resource managing. Every single move has you on the edge of your seat because of this. With the fights actually a nice respite, and chance to catch your breath.  Now, that isn't to say the fighting isn't challenging. Think Assassin's Creed, but with an element of luck thrown in. As all your armor and weapons are picked up by chance. Sometimes taken away as well. As was the case one round when Goblins came and stole my shield. Leaving me with just an axe to try and defeat a veritable army of bandits.  There literally isn't one BAD thing to say about the experience this game brings to the table. One can only nitpick at the few misspelled words, or similarities in Boss appearance. None of which diminish the shear enjoyment one gets from traversing the ever changing game board, unlocking new cards, and dodge rolling around trap-filled arenas with fire-breathing lizards, musket-toting skeletons, and kung-fu ratmen all hot on your tail.  At launch the game was 20 USD. It's since gone up to 25 USD. Would I recommend people wait for a sale to pick up what I'd describe as the biggest surprise in gaming since the early 2000s? No. A resounding NO! Go, buy it now. Play it, enjoy it. You're welcome! It's such a good game, it's worthy of the meme, ""Shut up and take my money""http://youtu.be/moxbxFrpYSo?list=PLFP2lSgrnK83QVkL1rerIAHKriEA3OhMV "

												They shouldnt even call this a game...it should be known as art. These developers sure as hell had known what they were doing, this game takes the greatest aspects of a few popular games and puts them into perspective, the combination of choosing different paths, random chances, skill, deck building, inventory management, a unique aray of card abilities, the feeling of a fresh page after every chapter, its amazing how great this game is, so glad I picked it up when I did at 50% off summer sale! I would keep an eye on these guys who made this game, if they do something only half as great as this...it would still be brilliant.Judgement - 9.5/10The games graphics are amazing, and the mix of genres is beautifully put together. I would rate this game 9.5/10. The only flaw this game has is lack of replay-ablility after completing the game, but you still manage to get 24+ hours without even finishing the story. Each set of cards has its own story, the fighting is fun yet challenging, all of the artwork is on fleek, the variations of weapons and cards are vast! This game is a STEAM ESSENTIAL, in my opinion, and if I were you, I would press that add to cart as soon as your done with this sentence.			"

												I really like the idea and the design for this game, but it's got some execution issues.The main board mechanics are really great. The way you earn cards and build decks to create random adventures is really interesting and dynamic. However, the combat sequences are a mess. The controls are sluggish and sometimes the abilities don't work, and it's very difficult to move accurately when needed. AND the combat doesn't really fit the game. The main board is a cardgame, and it would make sence if the combat was also a turn-based thing to do with your cards, insterad of a over-the-shoulder button-masher. Overall, not much fun to fight. I found myself wishing I could auro-resolve the fights, and get on with the card game. Eventually, the controls made it so difficult to get through a fight that I had to quit, which was disapointing because I wanted to earn more cards and see more multi-path story elements.It felt like two games: one a really neat, dynamic, replayable, card-based adventure game, and the other a crappy, boring, sword-swinging, variety-free combat  game. I wish I didn't have to play the crappy game to advance the sweet game.			"

												A fantastic roguelike mixed with CCG and ARPG elements. In my 90+ hours of gameplay (owned the game since its release), I had TONS of fun, but there were also some troublesome elements that were mainly tied to RNG factor (particularly concerning the obtaining of the Warlord and Iron Hunger tied achievements - doing those really took some fun out of the game and were frustrating quite a bit) and some bugs that were painful but were quickly adressed once they were registered (concerning the White Council and Winters Hunt expansions). As of the time of writing this review, the game is pretty much bug-free, completely stable, and filled to the brim with content; so don't be afraid to purchase it and experience the finest ARPG/CCG/Rogue-like indie game on the market,.

Hand of FateI cannot remember when I had such amazing feelings in a Game.GamePlay:As always, I start with the gameplay-explanation...You're sitting opposite to the Dealer (which is also the most important/interesting character in the game.) He is narrating the entire game with comments of your actions and happenings. You can hear his ironic gratulations on some success, but loves to see you suffer from curses. HOWEVER, he has a very limited amount of text and you will often hear the same things. Anyway he tries to keep the game fair and indeed I’ve never been treated such fair, yet challenging as in this game.On the table, the dealer places chards, which should represent 1 layer of a dungeon. Your goal is to get to the last layer of the dungeon to challenge  the Dealer's Champions. (12)These cards on the table is made of your own created deck  + the dealer's balancing cards to make it harder + locked cards, in your deck with Missions. You also decide which weapons, armor pieces, shields or artefacts you may get in this session. (2nd. deck)You have food, which would heal you +6HP each new Tile/Card you step on, but without food you lose -6HP per Tile/Card.Life points: 100 may get higher or lesser, depending of which Curses/blessing/missions you get.Successfully Actions:Some actions require “luck” (You choose out of four cards. These four cards can contain a “Huge Success”, ”Success”, ”Failure”, ”Huge Failure” which will decide if your action works or not.The four cards are open at the beginning, then get turned around and put together to one pile. Keep an Eye on it. If you are looking closly, you can see where which cards is. Sounds cheating? Well the Dealer knows how to prevent and shuffles it up to five times and sometimes too fast to follow…Your equipment slots:Helmet (max. 1 piece)Chest plate (max. 1 piece)Weapon (max. 1 piece)Gauntlet (max. 1 piece)Rings (infinite amount wearable)Artefacts (max. 1 piece)Curses/Blessings (infinity amount wearable)The fighting is simple made. 3D No own Camera movement! Aiming enemies with left joystick. (No mark on enemies) Small fighting Areas. (Also trap areas with no enemies) Many pictures on the steam store page depict that!Control: PS - ControllerSquare|Attack - With your Sword, Ax, Hammer or misc...Circle|ShieldBash - Breaks through enemies' shield. (Shield required)Triangle|Counter - Counter ranged-attacks or many melee-attacks. (Shield required)This is the Gameplay. On my opinion, these mix of Card-Game and 3rd-Person fighting is really well fitting.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ :DStory:The story is to defeat the dealer, which is accessible after you fought his 12 Champions!Graphics:I am not such person who things graphic is an important point. I enjoyed it and no eye cancer!★ ★ ★ ★ ★Leveldesign:I split this up in:DungeonLevelDesign: Which is at the beginning of the game very tiny, but later on, when you suffer from starving, you are happy to get a smaller area. (Random generated) which leads to very different playthroughs.Fighting/trap Areas:They are not random. If you are fighting in an inn, you will get and inn-Area, and so on...Don't forget the endless mode where you fight until your death. (Did play it one time and wanted to star after defeating the Game.)All in one this combination makes the game very interesting and the random dungeon makes every step a hope for nothing bad.★ ★ ★ ★ ★Music: Of course, I am also rating the music, which is in my ears simply amazing. <3Totally love the Battle/Dealing/Reward Music. The man did a well job. :D★ ★ ★ ★ ★Bossfight:Mostly I like the Boss fights. They were somewhat fair to me except for the  Dealer Boss fight, who spawns all his Champions as a triple pack (Jack, Lady, King). However, this is the good part, because it is still fair to fight. HOWEVER, when the dealer starts to make Explosions or light currents on the ground that are not dodge able, because you have to know where to stand, otherwise it WILL hit you. No escape. this is the only issue, which made me aggressive to die so close at the end. However, the victory felt more deserved than in Dark Souls III. ;)★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ just for the little issue. :/This was quite everything I have to tell you. I beat the game in approximately 13h.The last I want to recommend you is to read also negative Reviews. Even if they are not marked as ""helpful"", but they may contain things that are crucial to know before you buy the Game.The 25€ I spend on this Game was totally worth for me. Would pay the same amount of money again. EPIC GAME: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★!			"

												Another rare, yet plesant surprise that once in a while comes out of early access. This little gem isn't flashy or pretentious, it is indeed very humble, and feels genuine and smooth.The GameReading a few reviews while i was deciding if i should purchase the game or not, i quite didn't understand how the game worked, what it was about, and so on. I'll try to describe it in the simplest, most immediate of ways.You sit at a table, in a mysterious hall, playing a game of cards with a hooded man, his face covered by a veil. There are different kinds of cards:-Equipment cards (you get these during the game, they give your character the gear he needs to face monsters and such)-Encounter cards (challenges, monsters, mini trap dungeons, shops, bosses and so on)-Random cards (depending on the level, these cards are added to the mix by your opponent to ""spice up things"")You move your pawn through covered cards, one at a time, uncovering the cards you land on and facing the challenge. Each level is composed by 2+ randomized layouts of cards. The goal is to reach the final boss and defeat it, surviving all along. The game starts easy, but after a while it starts to get really challenging. The rng plays a big part in the game and it can be frustrating at times, but when you actually succeed it feels very rewarding. Each time you get to choose from the cards you earned which kinds of encounters you can make on a level, same goes for the equipment, so you can adjust your chances and create a strategy.Pros-Incredible replayability thanks to the randomized levels, cards and decks.-Big variety of creatures, challenges-Diffiucult but rewarding-Amazing voice acting and atmosphereCons-Like all games with a high random factor, at times, it can get frustrating-Fights can get a bit repetitive at times-You can't really play a ""class"", you're a standard warrior-ish guyI personally really liked the game, and i can see myself playing it a lot. It isn't one of those immersive games that you spend long sessions playing it, but it's great to play in a relaxed way if you have some spare time. It retains the feel of the old table games and definitely deserves a try.8/10			"

The TL;DR reviewIf combining a card game with a combo brawler sounds like the sort of thing you'd be interested in, buy this when it's on sale. At full price, know what you're getting yourself into -- the game is a little too shallow and a little too grindy to be truly great.The ""just lay the wall of text on me bro"" reviewHand of Fate serves up the combo brawling that was made famous by the Arkham games as encounters that are triggered by cards you collect in a game. Is this fun? Yes it is. Is it the greatest combo brawler slash card game crossover out there? It may well be, since I'm not aware of another game that tries exactly the same thing. Is it a good game? Yes. Is it a great game? No, it's got too many flaws for that.The brawler aspect is a serviceable copy of the Arkham system -- you can move, dodge roll, attack and counter, with a weapon or artifact ability thrown in occasionally. But while it works, it feels a lot more clunky and lacks the grace and move sets of its inspiration. Difficulty is cranked up by having the fights take place in what are often claustrophobically small areas littered with traps. Getting up your combo count, while presented as something desirable, appears to do almost nothing beyond adding motion blur -- you certainly don't appear to become faster or stronger, though frankly it's hard to tell. Even with all that, though, fighting is entertaining enough, if at times a bit frustrating. It's the card game aspect where Hand of Fate really doesn't live up to its potential.Deck building in Hand of Fate basically boils down to putting in the cards that will advance some encounter questline and throwing out the cards with completed questlines (since, save for a few exceptions, there's no reason to replay them). There's very little opportunity for strategy, save for, say, replacing your big hammer with the sword against undead when you know the next level is about skeletons, which isn't even rock-paper-scissors. Hand of Fate has the superficial trappings of a card game, but it's no more than a paper-thin disguise (literally) for what is at the core a dungeon crawler (certainly not a roguelike) with more randomization in the encounters than usual. And the randomization can be terrifyingly annoying at times, requiring you to replay cards over and over again just because you failed the random checks. Although you can do a little better than raw chance when you learn to track the fail/succeed cards as they shuffle around in a four card Monte, that still doesn't excuse this crime against gameplay.Even when the randomization isn't annoying, it's all a bit pointless. It doesn't really matter if you, say, draw a sword or a hammer, as long as you set up a draw of something that isn't the starter weapon so you can make combat a bit easier. The way a round of play works out basically varies between ""the player got lucky and is now breezing through the combat encounters"" and ""the player got unlucky and is now having a really hard time getting through the combat encounters"". You're almost never really in control during the card section, save for the few times where you've activated effects that let you make meaningful choices (like revealing part of the playing field). It is to the game's credit that it manages to dress up this illusion of control so well before presenting it to the player, but it's still no more than an illusion.Hand of Fate is a good game, in that it keeps you entertained. It comes tantalizingly close to being a great game, without ever actually achieving greatness. Combat just isn't smooth and varied enough, card progression is too linear and lacking in strategy, the story too shallow and mired in fantasy cliches as it goes on, and the ending (if it qualifies as that) is just downright disappointing, lacking any kind of payoff. While the whole does manage to be more than the sum of its parts, it still left me with the impression that it could have been so much more. Sadly, with the first videos of Hand of Fate 2 up, it seems ""more of the same"" is what we're going to get.			"

												I can't believe how awesome this game is. The trailers don't do it any justice. It's one of the most unique and fun modern games I've played. I feel bad that I bought it on a discount because it's easily worth the full price. I just have to keep flipping cards and seeing what the challenges are. It's like solitaire D&D played with cards. Or Sorcery! but with cards instead of a board game, and much more fun. Sometimes games come along that are so good they feel like art, and this is one of them. Just buy it if you like fun.			"

												A brilliant mix of deck building and roguelike Batman style combat. The story mode seems on the short side but the real fun is in endless mode. The voice acting for the dealer is really well done and provides an interesting atmosphere to the game. Highly recommend.			"

												This game is basically a rogue-like procedurally generated card-based RPG that becomes (at times) a third person fighting game. Its story mode utilizes a tier system that makes enemies become gradually harder as you pass each tier. I'm really happy with my purchase so far; it's a very unique game that punishes you just the right amount for losing (I haven't played Endless mode, so this is all about Story mode)Overall I'd give it a 9.5/10 at the moment; I've played through about half of the story mode in around 6 hours, so depending on how much content gets added in the future, I can easily see myself changing that rating to a 10/10.

												Game Score: 7/10Hand of Fate was fantastic. Completely original idea that mixes a bunch of concepts together. There's a fluid combat system, rouge-like playthroughs, and tons of cards to unlock. Everytime you play this game it's different based off of the cards you select at the start of the dungeon. As you complete certain cards, deeper more difficult challenges get unlocked. The dealer is awesome whether he's being a jerk or not. He's always ready to crack a joke at your expense.The randomness of the game is exciting, but sometimes it feels like such a drag. Many times you'll start off with the worst curses and no good items. You're better off just restarting than trying to make it through. The hit detection in battles is a little off. There were times when I was completely outside of a hit box or spell and I'd still take damage.Pros:- Lots of equipment and story unlocks.- Original rouge-like idea- Simple but challenging gameplay- Dealer is a hilarious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Cons:- Hit detection can be a little wonky- The chance of wasting your time dying in a dungeon due to randomness is high.I really enjoyed playing Hand of Fate. If you like D&D or hack n slash combat you should give this a try.			"

												During my review of Chainsaw Warrior (also on Steam), I commented about how the computer game port of Chainsaw Warrior was easier to play than the actual card game published by Games Workshop, because it was easier to play a one-player card game with rules as convoluted and dorky as a computer game than as an actual, physical card game. What would happen if someone walked in on you rolling dice and drawing cards all by yourself?""Oh, are you playing Solitaire?""""No! I'm not playing Solitaire. I'm playing a game where you have to fight zombies and aliens and disarm a nuclear bomb in 60 minutes or the world will be plunged into eternal darkness.""""...it is okay to masturbate, Jimmy. You don't have to be ashamed of your body.""""But I'm not doing the M-word, Daaaaaaaaad!""Hand of Fate is like one of those dorky card games. I think the developers realized this when they started development, and so they threw in the card dealer and added all the stuff about life and death afterwards. It definitely needed it - because the Dealer is what really makes this game work. Without the Dealer, the game is you, sitting at a table, drawing cards and hallucinating these battles and these traps and sometimes wrestling with a convoluted camera angle operated by a narcoleptic operator. Plus there wouldn't be all these interesting story crumbs as to who the Dealer is, why you're here playing this game, the big dust-up that will eventually happen between you and him if he draws one more ♥♥♥♥ing Devilish Traps card.It's not a bad game, but I just feel like it depended on a lot of the momentum from my earlier victories to keep me going, because I got tired of it after I got stuck fighting the King of Scales. Speaking of the King of Scales: This game has a difficulty curve that partially resembles a flat area and then a sudden, large ramp-up in difficulty on the last two stages. The difficulty curve ramps up on the King of Scales because the game forgets to tell you that his henchmen are all invincible while he's around, something that took me ten tries and five minutes in the Steam Community forums to realize. Also there's some fun balance issues that randomly make the game too easy or hard. And I hate when the game makes me have to run through a Traps level, because not only are you trying not to die to a bunch of traps, you're also playing with a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angle that hides some of those traps. So while it's not a perfect game, it's rather fun while the unlocks keep coming, but when they stop... oh man, this game starts to fall into a RUT.			"

Early Access Review
								Here's the best compliment I can give this game - I bought Hand of Fate and Shadows of Mordor at the same time, and Hand of Fate is the one that pulled me in the hardest and I'm playing more often, despite the polish of the other AAA title.This game does something I've always wanted to see in a game - watching your encounters be created through chance or fate around you, while you actually play through it. Have been wanting this since way back in the days of Vampire the Masquerade - and it never really came.  Hand of Fate manages this really nicely, as the encounter you are about to face is created by the very cards you draw.  The smooth Arkham-style fighting rounds this out to be a solid, very layered game.The graphics are unique and nice, a cool blend of fancy hand-drawn card/boardgame and more Diablo-esque arcade environments.  You feel like you're across from your nemesis/Game Master and that it's all playing out based on your interactions with him.  The voice acting of this GM-type character is critical to the game since you hear his voice so much, so thankfully they've got A-list voice work here.   Very replayable as you collect cards and expand the possibilities of each game.  Roguelike in that once you die, you die and your current adventure is over, but the cards you've earned along the way are still added to future adventures making for even more diversity.  This game is in early access right now and it still plays like a complete game.  It's awesome and in only 4ish hours of play I can already tell I'm addicted to it somewhat.  If the developer/s keep polishing and expanding this, I think it could potentially explode on the scene and start a beloved new franchise because so far it's as good as any I've played.  Think Talisman meets Magic the Gathering meets Diablo and you'll be roughly in the ballpark.  Thumbs up. "

								Hand of Fate, an action RPG with card game and rogue like elements that plays out like a tarot reading but with more violence. A true symbol of how different genres can come together to create something unique and intriguing.While it maybe still be in early access I would deem the game to be feature complete and just needs a little polish and there will be no reason this won't be a cult classic. A game what has innovated like this game has deserves recognition and I hope more rogue likes make more of an effort with adding a story to their games.

												I literally HAD to alt+tab in the middle of this game to write this review and recommend this game. It is AWESOME. I've bought MANY games on Steam and I usually get bored of them very quickly, but that is not the case with this one. The dealer is great to listen to, and it really does feel as if he has a personality. This really is an all in one, theres pretty much every genre out there in this game. I would definitely buy this one while it's on sale. Seriously, go buy it. GO! DO IT NOW!!!!			"

												This game is bloody fantastic, it has an amazing concept and a very interesting genre of a being a card game infused with dungeon crawling and rpg mechanics.  Relating back to the original deck of cards with Jack's Queen's and King's as the primary bosses, the game manages to provide a very replayable adventure/tcg experience. Visually, it's gorgeous and the voice acting is on point. The bosses are all creative and each have different ways to be dealt with, giving the game a nice variety. The only reason I would not recommend this game is due to the final boss dungeon. Okay sure, it's the big conclusion to the game, expect it to be a challenge yeah? Well yes it is a challenge, almost to the point where it's 90% luck and 10% skill related. Every time you decend a level you're cursed and you cannot gain any blessings, each curse can be extremely brutal to the point where I some how reached the last boss but with a max hp of 30 and significant stat decreases. Nearly every battle is involving a boss, which is reasonable, but to chuck you into a fight with a King and another King in a very very claustrophobic environment is just flat out unfair, especially with the King of Scales... Odds of selecting the 1 victory card out of the 4 cards involving the rest being failure is stupidly difficult as the cards are mixed obserdly fast and it would take a computer to even begin to comprehend where it is, and if failure occurs, not only aren't you rewarded but you're punished, every thing is punishment. It almost ruins the entire game and enduces rage just because everything that could possibly go wrong, does. And there is nearly no way to even remove these curses, as most of the curses would either prohibit it or take all your gold and food away so you cannot afford to have it removed.			"

												If you're looking for a card game / dungeon crawler / Batman simulator, this is the game for you, but you'll probably get bored before the end of the story mode.It does a lot of different things, and most of them work really well. The art is great, the dialogue is well written, well performed, and well programmed (even by AAA standards), and it's just a really sexy premise. However, a lot of the elements clash against each other, rather than gelling together. For example, the Dealer is a fine character, but his dialogue distracts you from reading all the text (PRO TIP: you can skip all the text boxes and not miss anything). The tone of the dialogue is awesomely dark, which makes some of the goofy card text feel inappropriate. The card illustrations feel realistically medieval, and so it's really jarring when the combat looks like superheroes smacking each other in the middle of a laser light show, and the player is represented by a comedic murderhobo with a silly beard.The first big problem is the combat system. It's exactly the same as the Batman: Arkham games, except much MUCH slower, more forgiving, and less exciting. The camera is useless, the hitboxes are vague, the animation and voice acting is terrible, and the rhythm just feels wrong. It simultaneously feels insultingly easy, and unfairly hard. If you're familiar with the Batman games, this game will just be really frustrating.The second big problem is that the game feels really slow and sluggish. Every single thing takes a few seconds more than it should, and it really adds up to a big frustration. In FTL, when you get to a store, you click the ""store"" button and it instantly pops up. In this game, you need to wait for a loading screen to load a completely pointless 3D environment. When you make a decision with a random outcome, it shows this long unskippable animation of cards shuffling. And don't even get me started on how slow the combat is--it's like the battles are taking place underwater! And in case it's not slow enough already, it goes to slow motion whenever you do a special attack. That made sense in Arkham Asylum, because it's a very cinematic game about a badass superhero, but it just doesn't work in a gritty roguelike. (And in Batman, it doesn't slow down EVERY TIME, and you can push a button to cancel the slowmo.) I really wish I could set the entire game to 200% speed.Ultimately, despite all the time you spend on exploring the board and managing your resources, the game just boils down to one combat encounter after another. All the methodical slowness on the game board feels like pointless delays. And since the combat isn't fun enough, it just gets boring after a while. To me, a good roguelike (like FTL) is one you can play over and over again. This game, I'm pretty much done with it before finishing the story campaign. So while there's a lot of good stuff in this game, and I had fun during the short time I spent with it, I have to give it a thumbs down.(The ""hours played"" on my account is not accurate; I accidentally left the game open in the background one day.)

												The mix of abstract rogue-like events drawn from a virtual deck of cards that is then played out in a Batman-esque fighting game makes Hand of Fate an easy game to recommend. The graphics are colorful, the sounds great and the voice over narration achieves something I've not seen in another game: an adversary that breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the player.The Dealer concept works for several hours of play as a sort of mentor, antagonist, peer and philosopher, making all manner of observations and acidic quips. This masked character sets up the field of play, composed of upside down cards arranged in a variety of formations. You move a simple, game-board style pawn, like if Monopoly went all Dungeons & Dragons, navigating a limited number of routes to find the stairs to the next level.The Dealer both taunts and encourages you along to a particular confrontation, completing a story-mode mission; or, in the case of endless-mode, the script runs short and he quickly begins repeating himself.While the game offers a fair amount of loot and situations to encounter, and the developers do seem to be adding more of both, it is limited not just by this single narrator, the Dealer, but by a total lack of customization of your character. Every time you play, you look like a background character from Ragnar's troupe on Vikings. While the Dealer is faceless, your character is stamped with one single solitary, indelible look. Seeing options for both, even in the form of a DLC that included more encounter cards and such, would enhance the replayability and deepen the experience.The combat keeps things fresh with relatively simple controls and a rock-paper-scissors structure of moves and counter-moves. Adding in the variety of effects such as freezing, cooldown reductions, stunning etc allows for a great many synergies to discover through repeated play. I did find the documentation of just how all these different statuses and statistics interacted to be lacking, but I don't think it ultimately effected my enjoyment of Hand of Fate.For me, combining the abstract fantasy tropes of the encounter cards with the fun, colorful and continually improved-upon combat, hit that sweet spot of allowing for my own imagination (excepting for being trapped with the one skin) to exist alongside the developer's sense of imagination. Hand of Fate helped me imagine many fun, pointless, rollicking and satisfying fantasy beat'em ups, so I give this both thumbs up.			"

												A really good game that shows a  developer with talent can achieve great things with Unity. And also that you don't have to spend $60 on a game for it to be fun and compelling.Hand of Fate offers a nice mix of card game and roguelike-like and does so brilliantly. The graphics are really nice, in sort of a dark/cartoonish style that I find really easy on the eyes. It runs really well, obviously, given that it doesn't try to go into the spectacular visuals with tons of shaders and post-effects. Instead it offers a solid, stylized presentation where nothing feels out of place. The voice acting is quite good, too, and helps set the mood, with the card dealer commenting on your choices and their consequences. There probably aren't hundreds of hours of recorded audio, but what little there is is quality voice acting and writing.Gameplay wise, it's mostly a tarrot game of sorts with some third-person Batman-like brawling action to spice things up from time to time. The action scenes are relatively well executed, as in they're functional (if not grandiose) and offer a fun way to see your bonus/equipment cards in action. They also help adding some manner of player agency in a game that's mainly RNG vs. you. TLDR: the actions scenes, while not the best brawling gameplay you can find, are well integrated and end up making the game a better, more varied experience as a whole.All in all, Hand of Fate feels like a very well crafted little game, that's not yet another 16bit pixel style roguelite, and asks very little $ for what it has to deliver.

												This game is listed as rpg, and roguelike. While the core game would be enjoyable to some it is not to me. Most encounters are left to chance with failure or success depending on the card you select. Most chances are 50% or 25%. The combat even on higher difficulty is laughably easy. Block/dodge. Attack. Rinse repeat. I enjoyed the idea of the game and the begining of the game. But much of it was implemented in a way that is frusterating. While I would not recomend this game, people who do not mind leaving things to chance in games, or redoing a mission becuase of failed chances may find this game alot of fun.			"

												Story mode ""complete"" as of 10.7 hours, mainly on easy/normal difficulty. I have not completed finding all the various card storylines (example is how you go and give a vampire your blood one card, then you get to go to a vampire auction as you get a token and unlock more story card options).25 dollars? Kind of expensive, but unique and fun enough game. It's fine enough. I got this game in a humble bundle for 7 dollars. Worth the price I spent. Gameplay works by getting a deck of cards, which has various events inside it. You have a token on a tabletop, which can move to adjacent cards. Upon moving onto a card, you reveal the event hidden inside, and will have to fight/go for a RNG card choice to complete the event. Pretty fun, the randomness is kind of offputting and I am not sure if its randomness can be ""read"" or not. During the story mode version (story mode + endless mode), you choose to fight various bosses from the dealers ""court"". These bosses are taken from a standard suit of cards, jack to king, with 4 types of enemies - dust (human bandits), scales (lizardmen), bones? (undead), and plague (ratmen/skaven if you're a 40k fan). These bosses have various abilities to make things challenging, and it's ok enough.Enemies consist of the 4 suits as well as other non-suits enemies like goblins. Entering a battle scene means you go into a top-downish arena to mash wasd and space (to roll/dodge) while left clicking to attack. Standard fare, it's not that difficult and gets kind of tedious in the long run. Until you get damage-locked by a boss, in which case it becomes irritating. Otherwise dodging a lot is required at normal and hard difficulties, getting hit makes you lose health, get to 0 and you die, no stamina bar.While carrying on the tabletop (i.e. not fighting monsters), you can also get blessings and curses which affect the difficulty level by making it easier or harder, or making things riskier. You need food every time you move to a different card, 1 food per card, run out of food and start losing health every time you move to a new card. Gameplay (battling monsters) - easy enoughGameplay (tabletop) - tedious+fun+irritating at times, very RNG based depending on cards/encounters.Graphics - Not too shabby, better than I expected.Sound effects - Nice music, nothing I care too much about but I don't dislike it either. Was just... good background soundtrack.Price - Full? Maybe not. Anything less than full price? Sure. Half price? Might as well.DLCs - No idea "

												It's one of the most unique games I've played involving cards as its main driving gameplay. The weakest aspect of this game has to be the poorly designed combat and the disgusting lack of any real character creation. Fortunately, everything else is a hit! The gameplay is intriguing and keeps you coming back for more. The interaction between you and the dealer is glorious and deserve much praise because the man behind the voice did a terrific job nailing the mysterious and inviting, but yet also very intimidating dealer. Enough has been said about the gameplay, so I'll spare you the time. Do yourself a favor and buy it!			"

												Hand of Fate is... a strategic action brawler game? I'm not quite sure how to categorize Hand of Fate, other than the words ""pure genious"".Picture this: you are a traveller seeking what destiny awaits you. A mysterious fortune teller deals cards face down as if they were the lay of the land, and you move your token across them. Upon contact, the card is lifted and revealed: you have an encounter. You do not necessarily have to fight to resolve most of them, nor should you shy away from combat, nor should you attempt to engage in combat. Each and every choice has potential outcomes and you are encouraged to experiment them all.Of course, you might consider the above description of the gameplay a little vague. Simply put, gameplay revolves around four phases.1) The choice of which adjacent card to move onto, searching for the exit or the boss encounter.2) The event is revealed, which in turn requires that you make choices on your actions and/or throws you into combat.3) The event is resolved, or you died, or something good or bad happened. Either way, consequences.4) You appreciate or despise what happened and move on to the next event as you continue your quest, or start anew if you got killed.The reason this game is so good isn't the simplistic combat when you do fight, nor is it entirely the great amounts of rich descriptions of the events you encounter (although that really helps). It is the dealer's words, commenting on what appears before you, your choices, his scorn when you take his pieces or his joy in seeing you suffer for what torments you. The dealer is an entire third of your enjoyment in this game, and it doesn't disappoint.Frankly, this is the game that I return to play sessions of between 10 minutes to about an hour every now and then. It is wonderful, even when you have seen practically all the possible encounters over and over again. But don't let my words deceive you: you will start the game with few things unlocked. You must complete the dealer's challenges, and with them you are rewarded cards to add to his deck. From better equipment to harder monsters, crossing through new and mysterious encounters as the game naturally progresses to a harsher state with more variability.You will rage. You will laugh. You will listen to a story in which you are the protagonist and the story-teller is your opponent. And you will love the Hand of Fate.Buy it, definitely. Maybe with a discount, but it's really a good game. As of the time of writing, there's also something else you should consider:If you like the Hand of Fate, or if the Hand of Fate 2 is as good or better than the first, buy them both!			"

												I want to start off by taking aim at a misconception. People tend to say Hand of Fate is a brawler, roguelike, and deckbuilder put together, but there's really not a deckbuilding function in the sense that people drawn to the word are going to want. Your encounters, gear, map layouts, etc. are represented by cards but it's more a way to reduce encounters to separate instances. It's an abstraction of systems you'd find in any roguelike. It's not Ascension or Dominion or anything like that.And that's fine! Hand of Fate is no more diminished by not being a deckbuilder than an apple is diminished by not being an orange.Hand of Fate gives a lot of bang for the buck with a reasonably deep brawling system -- a bit shallower than Arkham Asylum but deeper and more rewarding than most every game that's tried to recreate it since. Hack and slash, shield bash, counterattack, leap, roll, reflect attacks, and use powerful magic tied to cooldowns. Your experience in combat might change a lot based on the character you run, the gear they're carrying, and the blessings and curses that follow them into battle.The overworld is drawn out by cards. Each room, each challenge, each store and story element finds its place on your dungeon-crawl from the dealer's hand shuffling out your cards. Your choices here determine whether you go to battle in gleaming armor with the favor of the gods on your shoulders or drag your starving, penniless, curse-tainted husk to its last stand.Overall, there's plenty of content and loads of depth to ensure you get your money's worth, and a series of free expansions make Hand of Fate a good buy.

EDIT: Some information was plain wrong and has been corrected, see below...This is one of those ominous blind buys I do on impulse once in a while. I bought Hand of Fate because it looked weird enough, especially since I'm not a fan of fantasy games. I liked the idea of a random card-based dungeon and I'm a fan of old adventure books. So, HoF landed in my checkout cart for 18 EUR (20% off at the time) and I started playing while I had some vacation.The Good StuffAlthough the graphics aren't next gen or even really good it uses colors that look great (not that horrible pastel stuff a lot of games use at the moment) and especially the dealer animations were really fun to watch. He rolls his eyes at you if you take too much time, he tucks on his wristbands once in a while and his dealing animation is still so cool to watch even after so many rounds. Also, his voice acting is just amazing. It fits perfectly, the lines are nicely written and you always feel this play between the arrogance of the dealer and his goodwill. Even without a real background story and any personal events he feels like a real character, a really cool feat to accomplish if you ask me.The drawings on the card decks are also really fun. They look great, have just the right amount of detail and always give you hints of what to come without revealing too much about what they do. Some are like tarot decks (with conceptual or more abstract themes -- your event card deck that creates the dungeon), some just show you different equipment/resources, and some are based on French decks: boss enemies are jacks, queens, and kings; the numbers from two to six depict a minion spawn of two to six enemies, the suit determines the different types of enemies.The gameplay is also pretty cool. People call it roguelike and trading card game based but I didn't get the feeling of any of that. Of course you have randomly generated dungeons. Of course you have some elements of TGC's in there (like receiving new cards for your deck if you win a round, creating your own decks, and managing resources) but the game reminded me a lot more of those adventure books I read as a child... (""If you want to go down to the basement turn to page 278, if you just turn around and run away turn to page 141."") The basic idea is that you move your figure from card to card to reveal new and unknown challenges. They may be good (""You find a Maiden that grants you a wish"") or they might be horrible (""Someone ambushes you!""), but pretty much every single card is unique and many offer various interesting different events, depending on your choices.The 'Meh' StuffThe game can be very unforgiving. As someone who has played Dark Souls I'm probably not allowed to say that but the later levels can go twenty minutes and your hero will be in amazingly good shape but then everything will fall apart within one move you make. This bummed me out more than once but never enough to not restart the game.The sound overall is not really good, especially in fighting sequences, and the music isn't entirely special (although it never really bothered me, which is a good thing, I guess). The fighting mechanics are very much like those from the newer Batman games but they feel a lot heavier and simplified. They still managed to add a lot of diversity by all the interesting equipment in the game. Basically every single item above starting gear level has unique abilities that force you to adjust tactics (especially later in the game). Still, there are less than a handful of basic enemy types and the bosses aren't all that different except from one special ability, more hit points and more devastating attacks. In the end you beat them  all up by mashing 'X.'Another thing is: There is not a lot of end game to enjoy. After finally finishing the last story mode chapter (about five hours into the game) the only thing left is endless mode which doesn't even have a save-game option in case you're into one good run. So there's no way to drop into the game for a few minutes and play a round. The good news is that the developers are working on DLCs, but I couldn't find good info wether it will be more story mode missions with progress items or just new cards.Finally I want to mention the price. The game is nicely produced and definitely is fun to play but with a pricetag of 23 EUR I feel those five hours could've been easily ten hours of fun with some more levels like aces for each suit (or what about the full jack to king sets of lava golems and mages?). There wouldn't have been a need to draw and story-board twice as many cards, I just want to do a bit more before the game will go stale.The Final StuffDrawn in by nothing more but 'uh, thos cards look cool,' and the fact that I liked the idea of adventure books since I've been a child I think the game turned out great. I felt very nostalgic, even though I had my XBox controller in hand instead of a book. The ambience and voice acting is amazing while the fighting would've been more interesting for me would it have been old-school with dice throwing. Still, while the story mode lasts and while you still feel new stuff coming, you will be entertained, even if you're not a fantasy fan. I think my 18 EUR found a good place to be, if you get it for 50% you already have a great deal. I wouldn't buy it for the full price since the content is not as extensive as it could or should be. Finally, you might be disappointed by the looks of the character who is not costumizable and ugly and male.EDIT: I am an idiot. I totally forgot about the secret level that pops up after you beat the last regular boss (not trying to spoil too much here). So there might be quite a bit more time than 5 h in the game, the final boss is insanely hard at first so you can easily spend 10 h to beat him (just a guess, might be more, might be less).			"

												Hand of Fate is a truly unique game.On the surface, it's a fantasy-themed deck builder, with customizable decks of cards for equipment, encounters, enemies, blessings, and curses. However, there are a ton of facets that transform this straightforward concept into a sparkling gem. The player isn't simply reacting to a series of pseudorandomly-selected cards; she is testing her abilities against the cunning of the mysterious dealer, who maintains a running dialogue throughout the game - often questioning the player's choices, grumbling about the player's luck, and quietly gloating over the player's failures. Combat with enemies is a realtime hack-and-slash affair, with the player able to block attacks, perform timing-sensitive deflections and counters, and unleash mystical powers granted by blessings and aggregated paraphernalia. Opponents are ranked and classified in suits (Skulls, Dust, Plague, Scales), adding to the overall coherence of the theme.Finally, in the vein of a CCG or LCG, the game continually nourishes the player with a drip-feed of new content, unlocked not by buying packs of cards, but through exploration: provide a peasant family with food to survive the coming winter, contribute capital toward the elimination of the ratman menace (ratmenace?), bring down the necromantic Jack of Skulls. Failed on your quest? Perhaps the discoveries you made during this attempt will turn the tide for the next one.Hand of Fate is definitely recommended for fans of CCGs and LCGs, fantasy roleplaying, and anyone who's looking for a refreshingly innovative gaming experience.

												A flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless.Overall I really like the game but it really has some issues that can make the game really annoying. I think I’m about ¾’s through the game. The game has a beautiful aesthetic and makes you really feel like you’re sitting at the table with your sleep deprived and vindictive DM, along with some very cool music to fit the mood.The narrator/ DM/ creepy old guy in a weird crypt has a pretty amazing voice, and has a lot of interesting things to say. It’s cool to hear what he has to say when you reveal a new card, or his quip before the boss fight.  I also like the “choose your own adventure” vibe you get between making your deck, and the multiple options some cards have. It gives the game a great amount of replay ability.The game does have something in it that I find very frustrating when playing. When you unlock cards for your deck, some stay in your deck until you defeat them on a level. This itself isn’t that bad, but one card in particular makes this a nightmare. After beating one of the bosses three copies of a card called “Ratman Hunting” are put into your deck. These fights can be anywhere to an easy-ish fight to a nightmare, and very rarely gives you any reward. The worst part is to get rid of it you have to use a different card, and pay 50 gold, which is a silly amount. I have not been able to both find this card on the field, and pay for it, even if I sell all of my equipment. These cards are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Another big issue for me is that sometimes cards rules seem to change on you and that seems like it kinda defeats a large point of this game. I’ve had the probability of card change on me for seemingly no reason, and I’ve gotten encounters on cards that I hadn’t before, without so much as a witty one liner from the DM about patching the card.Also the arena’s get really cramped really quickly and are too small, and later on when they become booby-trapped it becomes a nightmare. Especially with the plague rats that poison you if you go by there body after you kill them. It makes what little land you have even more of a mine field. Overall the combat is serviceable but too clunky for the amount of precision it demands. Overall I like the game and it is a lot of fun, but there is some frustration factors. I would recommend it if you love tabletop games, and “choose your own adventure” style games, but avoid it like a plague rat if you were interested in it’s combat. "

												This game does so many things right its hard to get caught up on its cons. The sluggish combat can be annoying and repetitive at times but each enemy has to be defeated with different combat styles. Whether you're fighting 6 of Dust or 6 of Plague how you fight them will vary. Greatest $25 I've spent in a long time.			"

												This game has got to be one of my best purchases on steam and let me tell you why:This game is captivating it draws you in and tells the story in a way that makes you actually feel like you're there. I don't feel like the character you control in the game, I feel like a player sitting down for a D&D session and the character I'm controlling is my own, for some reason this game feels personal to me, and it's wonderful. I don't have too much time played yet on the game due to computer issues, but I believe I have those resolved and have been playing it without issue which is really exciting. I'm trying to think of negatives for the game, maybe something to keep consumers from buying this game, but I honestly can't think of any. Honestly this game is worth the $20 or less if you catch it on sale (as of right now it's 66% off for the Winter sale). BUY IT. IT'S A GOOD RNG CARD GAME OKAY			"

												A pretty unique game that combines cards with a very simple combat system and D&D style adventure building. I strongly recommend this to fans of RPG/adventure. 8/10It seems incredibly easy at first, but after only a few hours the difficulty starts to ramp up. Sometimes you do live or die by the sheer luck of how the cards are dealt, but that's just RNG for you. I don't have any complaints in this regard.The game seems to be about ~15 hours long to play through the story mode, allowing for a few failures (I'm about halfway now with 6 hours), but the endless mode offers near-infinite replayability, particularly if you enjoy trying desperately for the best possible scores. Also, there's a decent variety of cards to play with, so you can always replay a level with different decks to try something new. I think that some DLC or expansions are to be expected in the future with new cards and new challenges, so you'll get even more time out of this game then.I have no major issues with this game. The simplified combat does result in some ""clunkiness"" (you can play around it but it feels like you shouldn't have to) and I've noticed the occasional graphical error (monster heads stretching after death and the narrator's jaw showing through their face scarf for example). These are not things that tarnish the experience of the game though.			"

												Genre - Randomised Fantasy Card/Action GameWhen I first heard the description of this game I thought this sounds exactly like a game I would make if I had the skill and patience. I picked it up as soon as it came on early access and have played a it few times across different builds. First of all I have seen a lot of improvements made and have had suggestions taken seriously so this is a positive to the developers. The game is fun and due to the random element sometimes you get the luck, others you just swear at the screen. This I think is part of the fun. The action battles are okay, but are dependent on your foes and equipment beign well balanced. The way you play against the dealer and his comments add to the game's immersion. You will be collecting different cards as you play through the game so it will evolve with you.I really enjoy this game and I assume their will be dreaded DLC at a later date (I like DLC, if you don't want it, don't buy it!) and more achievements you can obtain. My main criticism at the moment is that there is only one character model for the player, I would like to see some sort of class choice at the start with different starting equipment.*EDIT* Played today after a long break the combat has become more balanced, and there is the equivalent of class choices at the start now with the wildcards.

												Hand of Fate is an unexpected gem. It's a deck building rogue-lite with Choose Your Own Adventure elements and combat similar to the Arkham Batman series. If that description is confusing don't worry, the game itself is pretty straightforward and easy to understand.Really the thing that sells this game is the presentation and dialog. The mysterious dealer is a great character who guides you through your quests in a really engaging way. There's a ton of replayability and I've honestly never played a game quite like this.If the game had a downside it's that the combat isn't nearly as smooth as it could be but it still gets the job done. Highly recommended for people who want something unique to sink hours into.			"

												A fantastically unique singleplayer tabletop-like video gaming experience with superb stories that is hampered only by some lacking standard combat.Hand of Fate simply blew me away. I'm huge on singleplayer experiences and this delivered. I actually am walking away absolutely stunned more videos games have not taken a similar approach to this. It just works. I know next to nothing about traditional tabletop games like Dugneons & Dragons but I imagine this has inklings of it. You're presented as a player in a card game against 'The Dealer'. The cards are dealt face down as a dungeon level/floor/area in simple grid patterns and you have to work your way through to the exit or boss. Each card your piece moves to reveals an encounter. These can be anything from combat to shops to games of chance. The storytelling of these encounters are where the game really shines. You'll encounter pirates, lizardmen, ratmen, the undead, goblins, minotaurs, hellbeast, bards, minstrels, drunks, sailors, priests, noblemen, and more. The majority of the stories brought me back to Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age as I have read the Conan stories. But I'm sure the D&D player, or the JRR reader, or what have you will find themselves in familiar territory as well. The deeper stories in encounters actually progress over multiple playthroughs via a token system. You succeed in an encounter you unlock a token. At the end of your playthrough, win or lose, your collected tokens unlock new equipment and encounter cards. So you will be interweaving multiple short stories at once through multiple playthroughs all while tackling the bosses which are the main quest. And it works phenomenally. Every sub-story is short but worthwhile and tightly written. I just beat the end boss at about the 20hr mark and I'm still working my way through a couple encounter story arcs that I may have touched on and began in the 1 or 2hr mark. A satisfyingly done endless mode will keep me going to finish those.The visuals are on point for the game style and while they won't blow you away, they do not detract in any manner. The sound is equally fitting from the ambient sounds to the music to the dealer's voice. The equipment, curses, and blessings keep things interesting throughout. Save for one sword I've unlock towards the end here, nothing is over powered or out of balance. The encounters that require ""random"" chance features a system that can actually be a skill. Four card choices of fail/success are shown in varying combinations, they are turned over, shuffled, and you pick one. A keen eye can learn to track the cards well. But it is still difficult enough I'd say I follow the exact card I want correctly 70%~ of the time even after 20hrs. Its one of, if not thee, best ""random"" chance systems I've seen in a game. Though, those who do not get better at it could find it as infuriating as flipping a coin to decide their fate. The drawback the game does have though is the filler combat. Rather than leaving combat to numbers, stats, chance, dicerolls, or anything else it is actual gameplay. Controller is highly recommended for this game and was the only way I played. Perfect couch game, but back to the combat. X hits, Y counters if you have the proper equipment, B stuns, and A roll dodges. Mix in some special powers on two bumpers too, if you're so equipped. It isn't overtly basic, or bad, or boring but it more or less boils down to timed button-mashing. There is definitely challenges to be had but the generic combat encounters just got repetitive and sometimes tiresome. The biggest challenge was staying interested in these standard battles. I guess that's the best way to put it; standard combat just was not interesting. I will say some bosses were an absolute blast though. Perhaps it was just the change of tactics but it was fun. End of the day, the combat did not ruin the game in the least but stands alone as the only potential earmark. I got this game in a bundle and I think that was an absolute steal. But being as cheap as I am I would still recommends waiting for a sale as always. A very hearty recommendation either way. Especially for the singeplayer leaning crowd. Don't forget to buy food!			"

												Hand of Fate has some interesting ideas going for it and I’m excited for the sequel, but after playing and finishing the first entry in the series, I’d feel more comfortable with saying that waiting for the second game would the better move. This game has some rough edges around it that make me extremely cautious when recommending it.The combat for this game is a painfully average Batman clone with not much to distinguish itself from similar games. The animations, the muffled enemy sounds, the uninspired graphics, and the somewhat simple gameplay that doesn’t change much make me loathe the combat sections whenever they come up. The light ragdolling is a little bit of fun and some of the more advanced weapons can at least make the screen light up with weapon abilities, but overall, combat is not the real draw of the game despite there being so much of it.Now if we’re talking about drawing cards, that’s a different matter entirely. I enjoyed the Dealer’s voice acting and sound quality which is important since he’s the only character that talks. He also makes some smart remarks every now and then depending on which cards are being played for a second time. The artwork for the all the cards also stood out and looked great. The table itself also has some little touches here and there. It’s kind of strange that this part of the game looks so much better than the combat areas you’re thrown into when those encounters come up.Navigating the game board is just a matter of selecting a card that has yet to be turned over. What makes you decide on which card to reveal next depends on the situation you’re in and the conditions of the current run. There are a dozen bosses that each have their own negative special effects that are generally tied to their theme. Sometimes it’s gold loss or maybe everyone moves faster and deals more damage. You have to keep track of health, gold and food (0 food means health damage per turn) when making your way through the unturned cards. Occasionally, you just have to take an early exit if backtracking to reveal the other cards could mean a cost of 7 food. The worst thing about navigation is hitting the same merchant card multiple times and having to select “Pass it by.” after continuing past the initial screen. It’s a bit of an annoying time waster.Every card, except shops and bosses, presents a situation that you can resolve through making choices. There’s usually a correct and obvious answer that’ll reap the most benefits, but many of them will have RNG dictate your success or failure. The RNG presents four cards that will have a combination of Huge Success, Success, Failure, and Huge Failure. Sometimes, if you’re watching carefully, you can spot where the card you want is going. Other times, it’s really up to chance and you just have to hope that the Dealer is merciful.Defeating any of the 12 bosses and successfully handling the various situations that certain cards throw at you reward you with even more and higher quality cards. You can gain cards that let you complete the next step in a quest, new events, start different combat encounters, better reward cards (gold and food), and different pieces of equipment to wear. By the end of the game, you’re not going to be wearing standard gear anymore since you’ll have cards that help you easily gain powerful equipment fairly early in a run.Finally, one other negative aspect of the game was the final battle which turned out to be a somewhat long and very boring boss rush in a boss run with very difficult conditions. There are blessings and curses in the game, but for this final run, imagine being unable to gain additional blessings and only able to gain curses on each new floor. It’s not an impossible feat, but sometimes the combination of curses can become extremely frustrating. For example, all my food converted into gold and I ate five gold per move. After going down to a new floor, I gained another curse that made me lose gold depending on my remaining health. Yuck. I was disappointed with how the final fight turned out and hoped for more in a game that provided a mostly positive experience for me.Hand of Fate’s card gameplay and narration are the only parts I truly like. It’s a somewhat rough experience and the RNG aspect can sometimes be harsh towards the end. There is an Apprentice difficulty if you need a helping hand, but I think that you’d honestly be just fine with skipping this title completely and waiting for HoF2. It might be a better realized experience that’s building upon the first’s foundation which is what any good sequel should do. "

The difficulty does ramp up as you slide through the tutorial games and into more challenging cards and encounters. As I write this it's 20% off and worth taking advantage of.			"

Early Access Review
								I knew I liked this game after my first minute of it.The idea seems simple: you draw cards like in many card games, which determine your encounters. But instead of the results of these being completely random, you are taken to a small 3rd person arena where you have to fight yourself, or dodge the traps for real -- in short, it turns from a card game to a third person game for those segments.And the gameplay in both is amazing.It is also a title that manages to get better with each update. I am certain that the final build of this will be well worth anyone's time -- and if you don't mind a few bugs and unfinished content, you can already have a lot of fun with it now.			"

Early Access Review
								Very interesting game. It definitely has that ""one more try"" factor going for it.I'm 60 years old, and have been playing computer games since they were born. I have 195 of them in my steam library, and this is the first review I've submitted. Well, I don't actually plan to review it (I'm way too lazy for that tonight), but this is the first time in a long while that I felt obliged to post a comment. The reason I'm doing that is that I have a feeling that this game might just slip under the radar, and never fulfill it's potential...and that would be a shame. I've seen that happen many times over the years, and ""potential"", is often somethiing that's never followed up on. I know that. My eight grade nun predicted that I ""had so much potential, but I'd never make anything of myself""...and she was ""spot on"" with that observation. But I digress ;) The game still needs a bit of work in terms of balancing, some of the choices that are offered are a bit too random...maybe a bit of RPG type progression could be introduced to help with that, but it's certainly playable right now.Anyway, I'd recommend that you give it a try. Use a controller; I'm more a keyboard guy myself, but keyboard/mouse is a little clumsy at the moment. I'm only a few hours into it, but I'm actually planning to give some feedback to the developers. That's rare for me :)Sandsifter "

Early Access Review
								TL: DR= Get this game.Where to begin? This game is so awesome and so clever, it's hard to know how to start.Hand of Fate is an early access game of indeterminate genre. Roguelike is probably closest fit, but it's a blend of deck-building, rogue-likes and Arkham Asylum's combat with a dark fantasy setting.Early Access: Entirely playable. Very solid beta release. Gameplay: You build an encounter deck and an equipment deck using cards you win through playing the game and defeating encouters. How this plays out narratively and mechanically is so clever. As an example, there are ""Ratling Hunters"" cards that become locked into your encounter deck until you defeat the ""Ratling Exterminators"" encounter.When you encounter monsters, the action takes place in a small instanced arena where you must fight for your life. You start out with very little but as you gain cards you can become an incredible killing machine. Once you have the ""counter"" ability, it becomes similar to Batman Arkham Whatever's combat.The encounters you face are randomly laid out as a tarot style reading. And you're going to die. Die a lot. Asthetics: Visually, the game is nice enough to look at. It won't blow you away but it sets the dark fantasy mood. The audio for the game is mostly good but there are bugs. The music is fitting, the VO for the dealer is acerbic but sometimes the sounds are annoying. Spawning enemies all sound like the 60's version of the Penguin (waaaark wark wark wark) and your dude sounds like Link but looks like an ancient celtic bad♥♥♥♥♥ Still, early access, it's forgivable.This game is amazing. Get it. Just get it. The only thing I really want is more customisation over my character, or possibly mulitple characters. Playing as a mage or something like that would require a different eq. deck and thus DLC is born. "

												A really well presented game wherein the player essentially traverses a choose-your-own-adventure style tale (built partially by the player via deck building mechanics) punctuated with pretty well implemented Arkham-esque rythmic action combat. Well worth a look if any subset of those words appeals to you.			"

								It's like a single-player Dungeons and Dragons campaign but with cards instead of a Dungeon Master and real time combat instead of rolling dice.You can build your own deck out of hundreds of cards and then fight against it... When you get in an encounter, it becomes a ""Batman"" style beat'em-up, requiring pressing action commands at the correct time in order to dodge/counter/etc.Loads of fun, should maybe be a bit cheaper but still worth it's price. 7/10			"

												This game is very cinematic; between its mostly turn-based and dialogue-option-heavy gameplay, the great writing and voice acting for the Dealer, and its excellent atmosphere, this is a great game to play with a friend in a dark room (no, it's not horror or jump scare trash). I picked it up after seeing it on a late-night stream, and I've since had friends watch it via Steam broadcast and heckle me to go disturb that ancient tomb because there might be loot in it. It even draws heavily enough from traditional storytelling and keeps its (most visible) video-gamey mechanics simple enough that I could imagine even someone who doesn't play video games enjoying it as a spectator/backseat player; try it with a family member or loved one and leave a comment here about how it goes! I mean that.That said, it's also enjoyable alone. I've spent enough nights with the Dealer, on hard mode because I like a good roguelike challenge, dying over and over at the hands of vampires or old gods or that bloody kraken that isn't even the final boss or what have you. His dialogue is intimate, and like I said, he does a great job setting the tone and atmosphere of the piece; like so many adventurers before you who have tried and failed, you have wandered into his parlour, and you now play a magical card game built from memories of your adventuring life that may very well have your immortal soul hanging in the balance.I admit to having been spoiled by free MMOs, to having sinking thousands of hours and zeroes of dollars into individual games skew my perception of value, but most non-free games feel outrageously expensive to me for what they offer, especially when they're short. Hand of Fate is a glorious exception, one of the very few games that I have not once regretted buying, an honour limited among my Steam library to it, FTL, and possibly Portal 1.tl;dr 10/10 shining ♥♥♥♥ing diamond of game design buy it now			"

Early Access Review
								If you like mystical rpg adventures. This HAS to be in your game list. You can costomize what event cards you can use, and also what equipe you may find. I would say 50% of the game is chance based, while the other 50% is skill based. The combat is simple, which makes it special, no special attention needed. WASD to move, click to hit, Q to parry/counter, E for execution, and 2 for special item ability, thats all. The voice actor is also amazing.10/10eNjoy! ^-^			"

												Rating 7.5/10Overview: Rogue, Card builder with Real-time combatThe Good:+ When different genres are mixed together the results can be very unpredictable, yet when they work you get a pleasant surprise. Hands of fate thankfully does a successful job of mixing rogue with building a card deck with real-time combat. The game is pretty simple in its execution, you build a deck with equipment and 'encounter' cards, the dealer then mixes in his own cards (usually bad ones). The deck is then shuffled and the cards are placed faced down on the table. Most cards have a game of chance involved, the higher the reward the higher the risk. By completing cards, you then unlock new cards that can be used in subsequent play-through’s, usually resulting in greater rewards. + Unlocking new cards and equipment is very satisfying+ You also have to manage 3 types of resources, health, food and gold. Every time you select a card you lose one food. Run out of food and you begin to lose health after every selection. Certain cards reward gold/food/health. Acquired gold can then be used to purchase food, equipment etc at a shop.+ To make things interesting the dealer mixes in 'curse' cards in the deck. These cards are numerous and can drastically change the way the game is played. I.e. enemies do double damage, lose gold after every turn etc. + SoundtrackThe Average:Combat is a big part of the game and it just isn’t as good as other games. Combat is identical to Rocksteady's Batman games, you have a strike, counter and dodge button. The animations feel stiff, hitting enemies doesn't feel satisfying and the mechanics never change. The combat starts to feel rather repetitive after awhile. I found it strange the developers decided to use real time combat instead of a combat system that used cards which is the games entire premise. Glitchy achievements. Conclusion:This is a great unique game on Steam that is a bit rough around the edges but ultimately provides a very enjoyable and satisfying experience. I understand they are making a sequel which aims to improve many of the weaknesses from this game. If you like rogue-lite type of games and are looking for something a bit different, hands of fate will certainly deliver hours of fun.  "

												this game is the definition of wasted potential. sure it's fun for the first couple hours. you'll breeze past the first half of the content in about 2-4 hours, but once you get about two thirds of the way through, the game takes a massive difficulty spike. the game starts reusing old boss fights, but they use them along side other groups of enemies, in addition to the ones that that the boss comes bundled with. see every time you fight a boss they summon 2-4 enemies to fight along side them at the start of the battle. it's impossible to fight *just* a boss. this wouldn't be a huge problem, except that in addition to fighting the bosses again, with more enemies this time, the bosses and their mooks are all powered up, they have more health, and more (and more powerful) moves. now all of theses things combine would be challenging, but managable if not for one major flaw: the arenas in which you fight get smaller and smaller as the game progresses. at the start of the game you fight 1 boss and about 2-3 enemies in a REALLY big arena making it possible to divide and conquer, and avoid attacks. by the end of the game, you can wind up facing about 10+ enemies including 2 bosses in an arena about a quarter of the size in which you found the original boss encounter. oh by the way the second to last boss is in one of the smallest arenas in the game, spawns with 4 ranged units with shields, has undblockable attacks, can block attacks himself, AAAANNNNNDDDDD his minions can't be killed until AFTER you kill the boss. oh and his unkillable minions (seemingly intentionally) position themselves between you and the big guy, and even when they aren't in your way, sometimes your character just seems to ignore him. the autoaim on your attacks seem to prioritize his unkillable minions for some reason, and even when he's alone, it will just ignore him entirely.all of this only outlines the problems with the combat encounters. most of the other encouters in the game are strictly luck based, and rely entirely on you winning a 25% roll, or you lose most of your equipment/health/provisions. all I can say is, I hope the devs look at this game, figure out all the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they got wrong, and make an awesome sequel, because if not for its compeletly unforgivable, unignorable, experience ruining flaws, this game would be in the running for the greatest game I've ever played. that said, don't buy it. it's not worth you money because you'll never be able to actually beat it without getting incredibly lucky and I mean that literally, no matter how well you play, no matter how clever you are, most of the game comes down to situations where you have a 75-100% chanace of immediately dying a completely unvoidable death.--------------------------------------------------------------------Response to developer's comment:the graveyard deals a ton of damage (I think I lost like 45 health most of it in max health reduction) to you if you are cursed, and you are always cursed passed the first wing if I'm not mistaken (100% chance for a negative, potentially run ruinning outcome especially on levels like the king of scales where you lose health/food/gold randomly and can easily starve). also the treasure chest goes from being a nearly garunteed free gain to a nearly garunteed chance to lose most of your health to gas and a mimick (again, often in permanent health reduction). those are the ones that come to mind right now, but I know there are others.basically some cards like the graveyard have a garunteed negative outcome if you don't know what they do ahead of time and put them in your deck at the wrong time, and others go from being really good during the early stages of the game to just being a death sentence later like treasure chest.now don't get me wrong, I don't mind that the cards change as the game progresses, I mind that they change completely *without any warning.* if the game told you ahead of time that certain encounters where going to get more difficult that would be one thing, but when an important part of my strategy for getting a good run going with decent gear arbitrarily decides to kill me with out warning... that's when I get a bit upset.my reccomendation would be to put a level indicator on encouters similar to the monster cards to warn you ""hey this has a much bigger chance to go south, you sure you still want it in your deck?"" but instead you have to learn that it can screw over your entire run by having it screw over your entire run, and that really sucks.all that said, I love the ideas you guys put into the game, it's really REALLY cool, it's just that the luck vs. skill could use a little bit of balancing more towards skill --or at least informed deck building-- and the arenas just get way to small and crowded to fight in later on and both those things really ruin an otherwise ingenious game.oh and btw, I hate playing games on easy mode x)			"

												If you loved table-top fantasy roll playing games like Tunnels & Trolls and Dungeons & Dragons but don't have anyone to play with, Hand of Fate will quickly convince you that you don't need anyone else.Story Mode is an Epic Adventure, Adventure Mode is better than that. In Adventure Mode there are many classes to play each with their own perks and drawbacks and special quest line you'll only see on that class, but the other non-class specific quest lines can show up in any class you play and be continued when switching classes.So you can play as the Explorer class and start the Minotaur Hunt quest and get a few phases into it then play as a Monk or Shadow Agent and pick up right where you left off and still reap the rewards...if you survive.Pros:CursesDangerBlessingsMagical weapons, armor and ringsBags of goldSacks of applesAdventureCons:The Jack of Dust's wife...man I hate her...

												Been looking forward to playing this game ever since I saw it in the store.There's one word I'd use to describe this game:  gravitas.Everything about it has a flair for the epic; for the dramatic....Think of this game as something like Diablo II in Card/Choose Your Own Adventure formatFrom the way story arcs are presented, the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, the combat presentation, the voice work, and the profound commentary provided by your card dealer, you will be left with goosebumps and O_O eyes along the way.There are various challenge modes you can go through after you've completed the game; there is also an option to wipe your progress should you wish to unlock all the cards again.There aren't many games like this - and I'm interested in seeing what the sequel will bring.

												I will recommend Hand of Fate, but certainly not without qualification.  Many elements of this game involve the RNG - the success/failure card picks, the combination of enemies you face in a given encounter (and the environment in which you face them), the weapons/magic/blessings/armor you have access to in a given game.  All of this can lead to a very frustrating experience.  You may desire to complete a ""quest,"" only to find that you can't seem to get the ""success"" card multiple times in the card game. Sometimes, you won't even see the quest card that game.  Perhaps I should've seen all this coming? I enjoyed the Arkham Asylum-esque combat, and the ability to create both your equipment and encounter decks. My main recommendation would be simply to quit after you finish the campaign. Tying up the lose ends, even if you enjoy the game, may be more trouble than it's worth.			"

This review is created for  My Curation Page.   Skip to the bottom for my Final Thoughts I purchased this game as a part of the Humble Freedom BundleHand of Fate is an innovative roguelike RPG card game with heavy top down slasher gameplay. You play a game of chance and adventure against the Master in a similar fashion to Dungeons & Dragons with hands on combat.GraphicsHand of Fate is visually beautiful. There are a plethora of maps, equipment, enemies, and, of course, the cards. The small maps are all unique and different from the last and are very nice to look at. Whether you're in a forest or arena, the backgrounds are all detailed and very well done. Every card in the game as it's own card art as well as it's in game model.GameplayHand of Fate is both luck-based as well as skill-based. Luck is a big portion of the game as it is in Dungeons & Dragons. Whether you succeed or fail an event boils down to whether you pull a successful card or a failure which can have positive outcomes or disastrous complications. Before every ""campaign"", you can choose the deck; what equipment cards there are, randomised events, and enemies that all have set required amounts to keep the game both challenging and interesting.After every campaign you complete, you are rewarded with new cards, events, and bosses. Every campaign can completely change the next, for better or for worse. Completing a campaign isn't completely rainbows and sunshine. Everytime you beat the Master, he bites back; with increased difficulty in monsters, and bosses. The amount of replay value in Hand of Fate is astonishing. There is never a dull moment. The first campaign can very well be your last because of how your deck varies with the increasing amount of cards added to the pool.Audio & SoundtrackThe music in Hand of Fate as well as the voice acting are amazingly well done. The voice actor for the Master is both mysterious and beckoning. To whoever did the voice acting; well done to you, good sir. The Master narrates the story that unfolds before your eyes with lulling words that pull you in the more you play. He taunts you but also supports you. Is he a villain, anti-villain, or a silent hero? The music is also very well done. The genre in music varies but keeps you on your feet with adventurous music pushing you forward toward the final boss and the sweet rewards that await you. As I previously mentioned, the music varies through the levels and campaigns and never bores you with endless looping tracks. The atmosphere the music creates is like no other and can help create impact with the narration of the Master.StorylineThe story for Hand of Fate is rich and interesting. Every campaign has a different story that seemingly interconnect. Every boss has a different backstory that the Master pulls you into. Some bosses have stories that make you pitiful for the hardships they went through, while other backstories make you want to drive a stake through the heart of the scoundrel. The Master is simply that. A master. He crafted all the stories, cards, equipement, and events himself. He is the storywriter of the whole game and everything that happens is from his creation. Hand of Fate is a game about a game that the Master has invited you into.Developer RecommendationsI don't have much to complain about Hand of Fate, but if I were to complain about any one thing, it would have to be the controls. The combat is fluent only after you really get a hang of the controls. The first few hostile encounters I engaged in had me beaten and battered as I tried to figure out how to really dodge and roll around the enemies before they attacked. Combat against ranged enemies is also a little bit awkward but once you get used to the contant running and rolling, you'll be good to go.Final ThoughtsHand of Fate is one of my favourite games so far. It's fun, and that's what I look for in a game. It drew me in from in the first 20 minutes and just like that; I'm hooked. I want to defeat the Master and come out on top of his elaborate story. I believe that everyone should try out Hand of Fate, even for a couple minutes. Rating:Graphics: 8.6/10Audio: 8.9/10Gameplay: 8.6/10Overall: 8.7/10Enjoy the review?

												  Dag, ya'll.  If there ever was a game I'm mad *I* didn't make, it's 'Hand of Fate'.  A sweet-spot mashup of roguelike, deck builder, narrative choose-your-own-adventure and ARPG, this game swooped in and became my favorite new game in my Steam library(which is pretty substantial at 520+, because I'm a Humble Bundle Hoarder).  The game is really pretty, first of all - very well polished.  The art on the cards is funky, medieval-illustration inspired, and the renderings on the 3D characters are really well done - ragdoll physics as enemies croak are super fun to watch, having them careen all floppy into the edges of the arena.  The random element to the game in terms of the choice cards is shell game style - you see which cards are which, and then you can watch them shuffle before your eyes - you can actually FOLLOW them.  The difficulty arises with multiple shuffles, but it's still great that it doesn't fall to RNG; there is some skill there.  The game is laid out like a tarot spread, and your pawn moves from card to card - you can hop to any adjacent one - and that flips them over, wherein you encounter what's beneath.  Could be a shop, could be an encounter, could be a token encounter - the tokens are a really interesting way to progress the game, and add replay value: each card with icons on the bottom have a chance to give generic tokens, unlocking random cards from the 'common' deck - when you finish a run, the tokens break like seals to reveal new cards.  But there are also storyline encounters - tokens with colored and unique icons - that when broken, give new cards that often progress the storyline for THAT specific card.  You may not reach the objective on the card - in fact, often you're not told what the objective is - depending on how you play you may or may not achieve the card's purpose... but the fun part is putting that card back in your deck to figure out how to defeat it.  Combat is Arkham-styled(when you have a shield), wherein you hit a button to counter when you get the green icons above your head(slap back ranged weapons, slide over and face-smash melee attackers), and red icons are unblockable so you can smoothly dodge-roll out of the way.  Weapons all feel different, they all LOOK cool, and all have different abilities, and not just simple ""double damage to undead"" type of stuff.  There's that too... but the additions are super sweet, like gaining cash from smacking bandits.  Arguably my favorite portion of the game is the Narrator himself - a mystic with a face veil and a hood who tells the stories of the cards as you progress through the game, and his voice acting is top notch.  He actually comes through with some creepy and cryptic nuggets of wisdom - his narration never seems overdone or trite, there's just enough to keep you entertained, and well crafted.  Listen to him; he reveals secrets, if you pay attention.  This game is a work of art, seriously.  One of the most unique and well crafted experiences on Steam and absolutely highly recommended.			"

Well this is an exception to that rule, its truly wonderful in my opinion. Have paid full triple a prices for a lot of games that didn't seem even half as polished as this is overall, it has it's janky moments yes, but they do get lost in the overall game and are very, very easily forgiven. Do yourselves a favour and pick this up because I see this being in many ""pundits"" top games list come 2016 :)			"

												Hand of Fate is a card game brought to life with Batman Arkham combat and deckbuilding to customize your events and equipment pool.It also has an endless mode where you have to survive for as long as possible with every card you've ever gotten mixed in the frey.Let me just say that for an indie game the production values feel triple AAA.So here are my biggest pro and cons of this game.Pros Responsive combat. A huge variety of equipment, monsters and events. The card artwork artist really outdid himself. Fantastic music by Jeff van Dyck. The dealers narration is incredible. A fairly lenghty story mode and a more rogue-like endless mode. Very stylized graphics that looks great. The game dynamically get's more difficult as your opponent's own deck improves alongside yours with more enemies and negative outcomes.Cons Unlike other rogue-likes the combat is easy enough that you can more or less get through the game despite what the RNG gives you. If you're good enough this does create a weird meta where good players will have a 100% win rate. Bosses are fairly weak when you first encounter them so it feels sligthly anticlimactic. Several of the weapons are straight up just upgrades over others meaning that meta decks get very similar. Every weapon is one handed so despite what you're using combat is always very samey.I really enjoyed Hand of Fate, it's one of the best surprise diamonds I have played in years.I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good rogue-like and also for people unfamiliar with the genre and want a more simplistic game with easy to learn but hard to master combat.10/10 Truly a shining gemstone to display on the cabinet.

												Pros:This game has hands-down the best atmosphere of anything I've ever played.  I really can't think of another experience that's sucked me in so completely.  The action is mostly quick and intense, with the card-sequences providing suspense and tension for an overall very well-paced experience.  Hand of Fate is one of my personal favourites; it's just one of those games I just keep circling back to again and again.  Cons:Most of the DLC is unfortunately based on long linear chains of events, and these clash badly with the much more freeform vanilla cards.  The camera is annoying on any of the bigger maps.  The combat is really frustrating if you don't have a gamepad.   "

HoF gives hours and hours of fun gameplay, and when bought with the Wildcards DLC it gives even more hours of fun.Pro's:- Extremely flexible (You won't play the same story twice)- Fun story elements- Challenging (Especially with the Wildcards DLC)- Does feature a ""campaign"" and a endless mode- You can acquire lots of armour/weapons from which all of them have different statsCon's:- The combat is too simple (slashing, dodging, blocking)- Sometimes you'll face difficult cards at the start of the game making it way harder to survive (Especially in endless mode)- After playing a long time you'll recognize most cards making the game slighly more ""grindy""			"

												Where did this mystery of a game come from? Out of nowhere it seems. I was intrigued when I saw the store page and watched some videos via Steam broadcasting. There's nothing quite like it. At its core its a card game where you start immediately in some mysterious location, at a very creepy gaming table and even more mysterious dealer. He deals encounter cards which form your ""playing board"". You move your token around the board uncovering the cards and your story or ""fate"" unfolds as the title implies. The encounter cards vary from quests, travelers, monsters, combat, shops, weapons, artifacts, blessings, curses, mazes and all sorts of other things (good and bad) too numerous to mention. Many of the cards offer you a choice which you must consider carefully as it will affect the outcome of the game. Your goal is to defeat boss encounters and move your way up to more challenging decks and bosses. All the while the dealer talking and commentating on the state of the game. The voice acting is superb. A very well done and hypnotizing soundtrack really sets the mood and makes you feel like your taking place in something epic.As you play you unlock more cards which then go into your deck and the dealer's deck both of which you can customize within the game rules. This makes the game even more interesting and varied as you go and replay again. In the end though each play session is procedurally generated as he deals the cards, adding some of his own and making each play through unique. Will you live or die? What waits for you at the end of the card chain? You'll just have to play to find out.Your three primary resources are health, gold and food, all of which are necessary to proceed. Along the way you'll need to (hopefully) acquire enough and manage/spend them all wisely or you might find yourself rich and starving, or poor and overfed with not enough gear to stay alive in combat. It's your choice but balance seems to work the best.The combat takes place in 3D top down arenas played Diablo style. It's fast paced, dramatic, very tense and requires quick reflexes. Here you can use artifacts, special weapon powers and abilities if you're fortunate enough to have found them to help you in your fight. If not then well.....good luck.Table graphics are excellent. The card art is average. The fighting arena graphics won't win any awards but are decent enough to get the job done. It doesn't matter though because the gameplay trumps everything else and that's clearly where the devs put most of their efforts. With the exception of the final level difficulty which is miserably hard, the game is near perfect.It's risky pushing the boundaries of stale genres and the litany of ""card"" games that flood the store. This game succeeds in doing so on so many levels. Highly recommended if you're looking for something different.			"

												Firstly, I need to enter in my overall bias for the game. It's Australian made, therefore it's freaking awesome! That aside the game delivers a turned based competent along with a live-action platform environment. I'm going to describe both for you.The turned based competent is a card delivery system where prior to going on your adventure you can select your deck of cards for scenario's and then select your deck of cards for equipment (ranging from weapons, sheilds, armour, rings and spells). The higher you rank in your adventuring quest the more cards you can have in your deck. You start your adventure on a 'dungeon crawl' in a turned based environment where food and gold is your life essence to get to the end game/boss. On each move a random card is flipped to tell you a tale or a random scenario that you will need to select your course of action. The course of action may having you flipping on a x4 success or failure card. Failure could result in lost health or food/gold. Getting to traders and selling some of your gear helps you move on.A scenario based could result in an encounter - which then brings you to the live-action platform part of the game, you have your warrior in a rear facing fight controlled by mouse and keyboard (gamepad optional). The card flip will result in the amount of monsters you are engaging and the tier level of monsters. Your fight then has you fighting trying to keep your hit sequence as high as you can to score crits, so it can bea a fast flowing combat.Overall this is a great go to game when you have 15 minutes or 2 hours to spare gaming. End of game will score you 'chips' which give you more cards to play with. There are modes you can play in for difficulty and an endless mode to see how far you can really go too, which is highly enjoyable or at times distarous based on your choices.A great game for the avid casual gamer market.Oh and the dealer has pure sex for a voice :)7.5 / 10			"

												An amazing aussie developed game, it is my personally GOTY for 2015Plays out like a deck builder card game and as you progress through the challenges you unlock more cards. Lots of little sub plots on the cards. The deck determines the challenge. The 2nd part of the game is a fairly standrd 3rd person brawler with some nice abilitiesI highly recommend the DLC as well, the different player characters enahnce the game a add great replayability			"

												I kept my distance from this game for a long while since I was concerned it would be too easy and light. That initially appears to be the case when you first start playing the campaign, but after a while it begins to ramp up and you get access to the ""Infinite"" score attack mode where the real meat and potatoes of the game is at. Really enjoyable.			"

								Intresting, stylish adventure awaits! Storyline and setting make this game a very enjoyable expierence, concept of a card-driven rogue game add a rather plesant taste.However, there are some problems with battle system. And this is actually the only problems I can think of.Firstly, in a battle everything against you, even the camera. It is sort of fixed and how many times I got hit just because I can't see the enemy right in front of my character - I can't even count. Secondly, slowmotion. It happens, yeah, cool stuff, but... It throw timing of the strike off balance so much, that it feels like your opponent DOES NOT GET AFFECTED by slow-mo. It can be just a feeling, though, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste.And third problem is the time which your char needs to react to a pressed button. Even if you press counter at the moment an emblem of a throwing weapon appear above your head, it doesn't mean you will reflect it at all. Timings a bit of odd.But! This game is great, seriously. And very good. Especially, the comments of your wizard opponent, so much soul put in this game... It rocks.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough.  It is difficult, awkward, challenging, fun, enjoyable, and most importantly it keeps you coming back for more.What outwardly may look like a simple card game starts to become very strategic in how you build your deck as you try to get that perfect run to that last fight.  All the while not being helped along by the dealer with his smart alec comments and little stories just to make sure you feel better about that decision to sell your sword so you can buy just a little more food.This game will give you the world and then smack you down hard with the back of the dealers hand in the next step.  Want a hand with healing? Well there you go, now here is something that stops you from being healed.You will keep coming back for more			"

This game is outstanding, and just plain old tons of fun!I have only defeated the first two bosses, but I am loving the story and design of this game. The battles are fun, the collecting aspect is very cool for OCD collecting types like me, and the decisions are interesting and compelling.Well done, developers (I'm not even sure who you are), you done good!

												Worth its price and more.Excellent concept, incredible replayability, wonderful voice acting (The Dealer is the only person speaking), cool fusion between a card game and a hack-and-slash, where the meta card game sets your abilities, equipment, blessings, curses, and challenges in the short hack-and-slash battles in closed rooms.Great variety of cards and stories.The downsides - can't customize your character, big discrepancy between very easy and very hard cards, the Dealer's voice actor is so good you'll wish they recorded more lines for him. Really, I'd pay more for a DLC where he talks more.Overall, very satisfied, an 8 or 9 out of 10 (5 being an average game, so that's pretty high score).Worth up to $40 in my opinion. DLC is worthwhile as well, but I would play the main story first and see if you like it. You'll love it or hate it. If you love it, buy the DLC before continuing.			"

												This is the most fair challenging game I've played in years. Sometimes you'll have a bad run that you can recover from, sometimes you'll flip the table after having a good start. But each time you play a round, you as a player get better. Better at assesing the risks of some cards, better at learning enemy movement patters, better at knowing how far you can go off course.Each time you win a round is a personal achievement against a cunning opponent, and the final victory is satisfying in knowing it was your skills and work that made it happen.Cards are fun. The combat system is dynamic bus simple (like Batman:Arkham series). Lots of re-playability!			"

												I never really expected to enjoy a computer card game, which makes sense because this isn't a card game. I've always loved story-driven role playing games. This isn't a role playing game. There is a story - I think - but I'm not sure what it is or what it is about. Is it about the dealer? Or is it about the bearded hero? Or is it about me behind the fourth wall? The dealer is not a fortune teller, and yet he knows why I'm playing, even though I'm silent like all the others.			"

Some of them are more RNG than others but they feel very, very rewardingMany events work like quests you must complete to unlock the following quests (cards)Honestly, this game has a great design and everything works really, really wellAudioGreat voiceover and audio effectsThe soundtrack is fantasticFinal ThoughtsI loved this game. On theory, when trying to explain to someone one the game plays, it sounds like a mess of tons of ideas merged into one game but this plays super well.Just pick it up with the DLC, I promise it won't disappoint you, it's a fantastic game.Higly recommended!

												If you love the risk and reward game this is it for you, Hand of Fate is an exciting and really really chanllenging game it's like Dark Souls combine with Darkest Dungeon where things can go heavenly or very very badly really really quick.At first glance you might think Hand of Fate is relying on a lot of an RNG(luck) which can lead to frustration because of it's randomness but believe it or not, i think it's really balance in this game, since the game gave you a choice almost everytime and like i said it's risk or reward, win it you gain a lot but if you lose it then prepare to get punished.One negative thing i can think of is the combat system, if you think Dark Souls is a dodge fest this is like even more dodge fest especially the end game where there's lot of uncountable attack and you fighting like 5-10 enemy almost everytime so it just came down to spamming dodge button with hit & run tactic, i really hope they balanced this and make the fight more tactical than just like smashing dodge like crazy.Overall Hand of Fate is an exciting and challenging game with interesting story and excellent voice acting in the game if you love these kind of stuff then hesitate no more trust me from hard core Souls fan here.

												This game has a cool idea but is poorly executed. In my opinion the combat is the most fun to be had but felt too simple. The only time I struggled in combat was when there were a ton of traps or when I was getting spammed with ranged attacks. The rest of the game just feels like complete luck. I guess there's some strategy in building the encounter deck but really the ""hardest"" encounters are just luck in my opinion. Also I feel a big disconnect between the exploration and the combat. I didn't really feel like I wanted any of the things I could get from the encounters or the shops, I just wanted to get to the boss with a decent amount of health and at least my starting equipment.Also the illusion of choice in picking cards is annoying instead of adding anything in my opinion; a simple roll without my input would feel much better to me.

												Just restarted this recently after getting 3/4th of the way through the last time I played. Really a well executed and nifty concept, the deck based system allows for brancing out into all sorts of little occurences, events, decisions, and paths, without seeming random or forcing you to physically run everywhere like an adventure game. You get all the important snippets of an adventure, while also feeling like you had a part in its generation due to the deck building. Also you get to do actual combat rather than anything turn based, which is nice.Nifty idea, well executed, the Dealer and the associated Lore and atmosphere are excellent.			"

												Not sure why this game's getting somewhat average reviews, because it's awesome. Has a Fable-like vibe, though completely different with the card game and chance elements.

												Hand of Fate is a great twist on the roguelike genre that bursts with potential. Its full of surprising charm, from its charismatic dealer to its invigorating music, and the deckbuilding and evolving encounters are addictive. Its real-time combat is a welcome change and ought to tip the balance in your favour, but too often it feels more unfair than the chance elements themselves. It will both involve and frustrate, but overall it's a success and worth the purchase.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, but I can only recommend with caution as it has some extremely frustrating issues.The devs did an excellent job blending a deck-building game with Batman/Arkham style combat sequences. As you progress through the game with the starting deck, you get to unlock more cards that build up equipment, gold, stats, blessings (buffs and other bonuses), curses (debuffs and other penalites), and different story-driven encounters. This helps as you grow more powerful through the game as you play randomly generated matches from your deck (with cards added by the Dealer) and each culminating in a mini-boss fight.A mini-boss is a stronger version of an ordinary mob with a unique and deadly uninterruptible attack that will be spammed with gusto. If you see them preparing to launch one, your only defense is to get away.During a match you will have any number of encounters that throw you into a succeed/fail situation, a choice-making situation, a pit stop to buy/sell stuff, or a combat situation. Combat has all the basic Arkham moves: Strike, Counter, Stun, and Dodge. There's also a combo meter that improves your damage if you can keep chaining hits. If you've equipped a weapon that has a magical power it will have unlimited uses + cooldown. You can also have an artifact equipped with limited uses + cooldown (artifact vanishes after last charge is spent).if you run out of health for any reason (damage from combat, starvation or a failure on a random event) you have to start the entire match over again, but any new unlocked cards are always added to your permanent deck. A match contains 3-5 levels made up of 6-12 randomly drawn encounter cards per level. The random layout of the cards at any level determine if you have to proceed through all of them or get to pick your path while searching for the exit to the next level. Also, you start every match with basic equipment. You only get your upgraded equipment via card draw awards or having enough money to buy an item from a shop. This means it's entirely possible to reach the end of a match and face off against the mini-boss with only starting armor/shield/weapon. There are no guarantees. You can even lose your starting items along the way from failed encounters and be forced to use light armour, a rusty axe, and/or no shield.Despite the set-up sounding a bit tilted against you, it actually tends to balance out pretty well.Well, most of the time. Then you get into the clunky stuff:Unlike the Batman games, you have no camera control. Therefore in a 3D space certain maps will have blocked lines of sight due to poor camera placement -- either you won't be able to see enemies or you won't be able to see your own character. While most combat scenarios don't suffer too much from this, it can cause serious health loss when fighting large numbers, especially if a mini-boss is thrown into the mix. Imagine playing an Arkham game where a building suddenly blocks your view of the combat and only resolves if you blindly roll some direction until the camera clears the building. The same thing can happen with a ton of mobs in the foreground, so being near the back of the map is almost never a good idea. Healing in combat is tied to a handful of items and even then it's all passive (except for one weapon's magic ability) and almost never enough to make a difference. So there is no failsafe against taking hits due to camera issues -- the only rule of combat is ""don't get hit"".This alone wouldn't cause me to dislike the game. In fact I was having a blast despite this. Until the final match...Normal difficulty was already plenty challenging, but the final match of story mode where you face off against the Dealer is close to impossible without extremely good luck. (I don't even want to think about the odds at hard difficulty.)Your only true advantages in the Dealer match are: Like all matches you get to choose 32 equipment and 32 encounters you will use from among all your unlocked cards. In this case you must stack your play deck like mad to avoid as many potentially bad outcomes as possible. You get a ring that reveals which cards are shops at the beginning of each level in the match. You get one random piece of equipment. Usefulness depends on what you chose to put in your play deck.The disadvantages are: You start with two curses. One removes any blessings and prevents you from acquiring others. The other adds a curse card every time you move to the next level in the match. The Dealer's pain cards are significantly shifted toward removing health permanently, lowering your survivability. Most combat encounters no longer drop loot, meaning fewer chances to snag equipment upgrades or money to buy them. Increased chance to fail in succeed/fail encounters. Some choice scenarios also get worse.  For instance, there is an encounter card where a wounded knight lies on the side of the road with the option to help him or ignore him. Under normal circumstances you could ignore him and nothing will happen, but in this match if you ignore him you'll draw a curse card and sometimes you won't get the option to help, he'll just attack. More pain cards are drawn for failure and huge failures.The entire match leads up to the final combat against the Dealer. But you don't fight him. Instead he summons four waves of enemies each containing THREE mini-bosses you fought before and sometimes a few adds. You'll have at least 5 curses unless you spent money to remove some, no blessings, most likely a 10-25% health penalty, very possibly not at full health when combat starts, no healing, mostly the starting armor/shield/weapon, and possibly a useful magic weapon or artifact. And that's assuming you actually make it to the fight. If you die at any point, you have to replay the entire match.So while normal story mode keeps raising the challenge gradually from match-to-match, in the last one the difficulty spikes drastically. The imbalance has caused the average player to either give up or spend more time on the last match than the rest of the game combined to beat it. This is the most commented topic on the game's discussion boards.And yet, would draw cards again in Endless Mode. And looking forward to ... :DRating: 7.5/10Excellent concept. Definitely worth playing as long as you can make peace with the fact that you'll probably never complete story mode unless you play at easy difficulty (or the devs fix the final match balance). Seriously needs camera rotation to improve combat. "

Early Access Review
								         A card game rougue like. It says ""Beta"" which while true they aren't missing much. Mainly a few sounds here and there. So there will be an odd silence when you would expect a clink of metal or for your masked opponent to say something to you. Other than that maybe a few features here and there are missing like custom cards, characters and annoyingly enough a tutorial. I would love to see classes implemented and more in depth card play.        The 3D combat is simple but works well into the game. Each battle is short and usually is kept spiced up with traps, new enemies, and modifiers to gameplay. Its got a very batman arkham feel to it. With dodging countering and attacking while you bounce from enemy to enemy beating them over the head with that shiny new mace you got from a gorge. Then you play a little bit more of the card game and get some rewards and get excited for the next combat so you can test out that hail of daggers power you got. I'm perfectly fine with the simple short combat and never felt like it was hindering gameplay.        Now I should note that the whole card game bit is rather soft. It is a deck builder but the element is light and plays more of a thematic role (which by the way is my favorite part and by no means is a bad thing) The whole time your playing the game you are constantly getting new cards which you get to discover and play with. Everything very much feels like a mystical card game of sorts. Not a hearthstone/magic the gathering feel but none the less a mystical card game. (also my other favorite thing no microtransactions unlike many card games) The price may seem steep but I went ahead and took a quick peak of gameplay and was quite impressed. I won't expect you to get this game after my review but I would at least ask that you go take a peak at some gameplay even if you skip around the video. Short Hand: Love the theme and constant rewards.Mildly annoyed at a few small features that I feel are missing.			"

The music is good, the dealer's voice is great with his speeches, the deck of card is really wide and so the choices too !The story mode let you beat each Jack, Queen and King of each 4 series through chapters. At the end of each chapter you have to deal with the Jack or Queen or King with a battle, a kind of small boss ! When you beat 3 or 4 of them you unlock a starting bonus and malus. When you succeed any encounter you unlock more cards by acquiring its token. Also each chapter have their own encounters, curses, blessings and shop that are added to the deck.The battle are played in real time with the stuff you got, the highest combo you make the heavier you attack. You need to manage your health and many items can help you like shields (reflect projectiles, counter attack, stun), artifacts (magical spells) and others ! You can also discover some vault to steal some gold if you dare avoiding all the traps ! There are also many enemies you can defeat, many encounters and lot of gold to gain and spend but do not forget to buy food before starving to death ! Don't worry you can still continue your journey while starving, but you'll soon need to find supplies before your last breath.In this game there is also a part of luck, you can still see the shuffle to guess where the card will be if you are able good enough or you can also have some equipment or blessing that will help you a lot. Also some fight can be really tough but you can easily get the strongest equipment you can to succeed every battle.(#):There is at least one little annoying thing with the controller, you can be really precise that much while you're moving. Indeed, when you're facing north and want to get south you'll need to go in circles instead of turning back. So that may be a little tougher to avoid traps.(*):The good thing is you can quit the game whenever you want and resume it before you reached the previous encounter. So you can use that to avoid death or avoid some encounters failures whenever you want.			"

												Hand of Fate is a rogue-like-like.  It has randomly generated ""dungeons"" with random beneficial and detrimental events and effects that either help or hinder your progress.The story mode:- gives you a short, multi-level dungeon to defeat- with the boss of the dungeon being the major goal.- Can you find and defeat this boss before you die?- If so, you win and are granted access to the next story mode level/dungeon/boss.The endless mode:- is very similar to the story mode, except for three main things:- First, it never ends... there's no final dungeon floor with a boss on it, and you just keep going until you die.- Second, you have no control over which cards are included in the deck - they all are, including the ones you hate.- Third, every floor  grants some sort of curse or other detrimental effect that will usually follow you for the remainder of that run - better hope it's just 5 hp damage or something, which you can generally recover from quickly, and not some intense curse that affects food/gold acquisition.As you succeed at card events, you will unlock additional cards, including new equipment, new card events, and new bonuses.  In this way, even though your blessings/curses/equipment/etc. don't carry from dungeon run to dungeon run, you do progress.  You are unlocking a deck, much like opening a booster pack in a trading card game.  It's a fun way to progress in a game that otherwise focuses on each single challenging run.Is it worth buying?  I got it as part of a Humble Bundle, and honestly, I can see myself coming back to play this for years to come.  I don't like buying games at full price, but if I knew there'd never be a deal on this game, I'd probably buy it.  I see it as a must have for any fan of rogue-like-likes.Oddly enough, it reminds me most of FTL (Faster Than Light), the rogue-like-like where you pilot a spaceship attempting to avoid and eventually defeat the evil fleet that wants you dead.  FTL is another exceptionally good game that deserves your attention if you enjoy rogue-like-likes.			"

												Terrificly executed game. It's a mash up of everything great in video games. When I read that it had Arkham style combat and deck building I immediately thought, ""How in the world would that work? They're not even part of the same genre!"" This game pulls it off and adds a ton a replayability through the use of random board paths.As the game progresses, it becomes brutal. There's a good chance you will die even when everything seems to be going your way. Score some critical successes on a few events and it doesn't look like anything can slow you down? Critical failure. You're now starving and down to 23 health before a pack of 10 Ratmen gang up on you and poison you to death with their lingering acid.It's both oddly satisfying and frustrating at the same time. It's not perfect, but you'll have so much fun starting up another run that you won't even care.			"

												Test your hand of fate as the dealer progressively stacks the deck against you in this rogue-like rpg.This is one of the most enchanting games I've ever played - It's the perfect combination of story telling, atmosphere, action, strategy and rogue-like rpg mixed into one.+Slow motion killing blows and ragdoll physics make you feel like a god.+Active support from the developers.+Engrossing music- The only drawback is that you can have a bad streak of cards drawn against you that will completely cripple your run.I recommend buying this game even at full price!Overall - 9.5/10			"

												25% chance to just game over on an ironman style game. Game over, and very very angry.Let me explain. This is a game where many of your decisions are opaque; you have to make so many choices without full information, and without an idea what might go wrong. This is generally a bad design decision, but in Hand of Fate it is a feature. Early on there are simple challenges with simple outcomes. You keep encountering the same things, and discover through trial and error which things are worth attempting, avoiding.The game screws with you a bit. The same card can have different outcomes that are not visible. When you're out of food, there seems to be a bias for gaining food from encounters, even ones you would not expect it from. There are variations of the same encounters too, which keeps the game fresh. These are excellent designs, though not perfect. I've had at least one run where I found 0 food. Which is annoying, but it's a proceedural game. It's bound to happen from time to time.Settling encounters is done three ways: Decisions, chance and combatCombat, which is often difficult depending on circumstance, but largely skill based (though having the right equipment and blessings will make you into an unstoppable monster). It's possible to win almost every fight regardless of what you are fighting, and your circumstances.Decisions, as I have mentioned are largely opaque, until you have encountered a card many times, and seen all the outcomes.And chance is settled by four cards, which are shown to begin with, then shuffled a number of times depending on the difficulty of the check. A 1 shuffle is really slow, and you can follow the cards with your eyes easily, so can more easily pick the success or failures. A 6 shuffle is so fast you are basically choosing at random.BUT, the great success/success/fail/great failure is again opaque. Sometimes less successful checks bring greater boons.And this brings me to where the system starts to have trouble: Sometimes to progress stories you must fail. Narratively, these make sense, but it takes away your agency. You are already making blind decisions. But now you're expected to go for a failure, when the rest of the game has trained you to avoid it?Finally, the situation I found myself in. Play this game of chance with some devils (the fourth in the chain, I believe, and might be the first time I encountered this particular one). Yes/No. Hrm. These guys have cursed me in the past for failing. I can deal with more curses, if it comes to that. See the range of cards. Keep an eye on the great success... shuffleshuffleshuffleshuffleshuffleshuffle. Oh well. Ok. Hm. Pick. Total failure ""At least you got an achievement, (12 fails/total fails in a single session)"". Great, probably going to get two more curses... Auto dead. Game over.So:Opaque choice.One random, skill-free check.Automatic game-over despite all other conditions.Automatic loss, on an effective total random 25% chance.OK. That just happened. Can I play a game, that through no fault of the player, you can simply lose?I could just avoid that card... but I also know that other cards have several variations. This same run I lost 150 gold and an artifact to a card that I thought only had beneficial effects. So yeah. Instant death can be in other places too. It could be on every card, hidden behind a check I have so far never failed before, or a variation I haven't faced.My trust is broken. I cannot play this game anymore.			"

								As of Beta build 11369:Damn unique gameplay. Take CCG, add some rogue-like elements, a bit of RPG stuff and some action combat and you'll get Hand of Fate.Incredible replayability, cool narration, nice art style and overall a very good experience if you like card games.The weakest part at the moment is action combat - it's competent, but pretty plain.Oh, and gamepad feels FAR better than keyboard. Once they'd sort this out - gonna be one hell of a game!More detailed look in the video:

								Hand of Fate is a mixing of genres. The goal of the game is to ultimately beat the Dungeon Master-esque character sitting across the table from you. while overall a great game it really shines when you actually start. the game starts you off with a pre-made deck and a relativley linear route to take. as you progress you will have random events and encounters the combat encounters are well made and the combat system a ""callback"" to my batman days. as you progress through the game you eventually reach the boss which scales in difficulty to what level you are on. obviously while this game IS in early acess it is still a worthy mix of binding of isaac, the batman game franchises, and even tabletop RPG's like DnD.definitley a85/100			"

												I have only played Hand of Fate for through about half of the Story mode decks but, I must say it is one of the greatest games I have ever played.  Combining the death and start over mechanic of a Rogue Like, with the addictive nature of a Deck Builder was an absolutely brilliant idea.  Having the encounters with monster cards be played out in a slightly Arkham Style (Attack/Counter/Dodge/Stun) was an even further brilliant idea.  Although the combat is the weakest part with a fixed camera, it is still manageable and fun.  Trap Rooms are also played out in this 3rd person camera style as you dodge your way through a trap maze.Even if you complete all 12 of the storymode levels there is an Endless mode to see how far you can go.  The game starts out relatively simple, but starts to become challenging about 1/4 of the way through the Story decks.Add to this the amazing way it's presented, the dealer is well voice acted and doesn't get annoying.  I cannot recommend this game enough.It's reminds me of playing a game of Munchkin, but against a dealer instead of a group of friends.  Absolutely brilliant.			"

												I usually never complete games. Even if I like a game, I play it for a few hours and rarely do I play them again. I usually manage to play free to play or horde mode games more than 30 hours. But this game...I am well over 20 hours already and not even beginning to feel like I should stop anytime soon. Only just now am I nearing the end of the game content wise, but that does not mean that the game is over. It just means that I am almost ready to start playing Endless mode properly. An unique game that is a wonderful combination of different genres you would not usually mix.  A collectible card game mixed with a third person arkham style brawler is something you would not expect to work this well, but it just does.  "

								A great mixture of rogue-like, RPG, and card based elements makes this a terrific game.  It combines the combat of the Arkham series with the elements of any fantasy table top, pencil and paper RPG.  At the beginning of each story quest which culminates in a boss encounter, you build up an encounter and an equipment deck of cards that you have acquired previously.  The events of the story and the rewards of various adventures in that quest are randomized from these decks and a couple other decks the Dealer has at his disposal.  This gives the player more agency in the sequence of events and what equipment could be acquired during gameplay.  In addition, the game includes some resource management which presents obstacles to the player.One downside is that, like all rogue-likes, there is the possibility of having a ""bad run.""  You may not receive enough food and starve to death, not receive enough gold and be unable to purchase items or possibly be unable to complete encounter cards requiring gold, or have bad luck in general leading to the character's untimely demise.  However, the randomness that causes this problem also makes each iteration of a quest different than the previous ones and so, keeps the game interesting and alive.Presently, this game is in beta and the devs are still balancing it.  Even so, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys pencil and paper RPGs, Arkham style combat, and rogue-likes.			"

								Hand of Fate is a strange combination of genres - collectible card game meets 3rd person action. The premise is rather vague at present, but it boils down to you gambling for your life in a complex card game. You have an Encounter and Equipment deck, which you can edit as you see fit, and the cards are dealt into game boards of varying shape. You move around the board, revealing challenges and encounters, which you must then complete to move on. Some of them are choise or chance based, others are pure combat encounters, some are a mix of the two.Completing encounters sometimes earns you more cards, which you can add to the deck for future games, and undesireable encounters can be removed, allowing an interesting sort of customization. Which encounters you see in a given game is still random, but you can influence the pool of encounters that's available.The game features 12 bosses, each of which has some unique encounters, rules or effects to contend with, and after each 3 bosses, the old enemies get stronger, new encounters are introduced, and the player's starting equipment improves, creating a very well-designed progressive difficulty curve, where the same encounter card will increase in difficulty as the pool of enemies and detrimental effects grows.Combat is simple but very fluid and works very well for the game. Your equipment has a great impact on how combat flows, and with a few exceptions, the controls are very tight.Movement is a little clunky feeling - turning 180 degrees causes you to move to one side slightly (picture a very tight turn on a bicycle - you're can't turn in place), which doesn't usually cause problems, but some encounters involve negotiating complex series of traps, and imprecise movement can easily result in taking otherwise avoidable damage from these. Overall, this is a fairly minor inconvenience, though, and certainly isn't a major detriment to the enjoyment of the game.Some attacks in combat 'track' targets, which is good, but they do it from a very long distance (often resulting in the character lunging around the battlefield from target to target). This works, but it looks a little silly, and it can be both beneficial and detrimental - it makes it easy to hit targets that're a good distance apart, but at the same time, it feels a little unpredictable, and will sometimes cause the player to lunge into an attack that they were well out of range of otherwise.Some of the encounters feel a little unfair - for example, there's a (very) late-game encounter that gives you a 50% chance of failure - and failure means instant death. Once you've unlocked it, you can't remove it from the deck until you've 'succeeded' at the encounter, and I died to it 7 times before finally making that 50% die roll. Since there's very few ways to see that the encounter is coming up before you step on it, this feels a little cheap, and I could have done with less of this, but the flavor of the encounter was at least appropriate, and a single 'game' only takes 15-20 minutes in most cases, so dying to this card at least wasn't as frustrating as it could have been.Overall, the game is extremely fun. It starts off slow and ramps up quickly with a very reasonable feeling difficulty curve, and the recent addition of an 'Endless' mode adds a ton of replayability even after defeating the 12 bosses. The 'ending' is not yet in the game (early access), but even considering only the content currently available (which is very substantial), this game is absolutely worth the money - even at 'full price', which is not something I will often say - if you enjoy the genres it's combining.

								Table-top RPG card game brought to life! Live action combat system with fluid dodge and parry system. Unique encounters and bosses. Every playthrough has been an entirely different experience from start to finish. The story mode is a great introduction to the game. In my opinion where this game really shines is in the deckbuilding mechanics and Endless Games Mode! Great game, very polished at this stage! Only down side I have had is a couple collision problems with environment when dodging enemies and occasional glitches where sound goes completely out or comes and goes. Also the gold pawn comes and goes sometimes as well! Other than some UI stuff the heart of the game and the deckbuilding mechanics are very solid and I would rate this game 8/10 even at its current state! Endless hours of fun!			"

								A mixture of random dungeon, table top cards, and third person combat arenas Hand of Fate takes the random chance of dice and tosses them out the window. While your travels may lead you to an unknown destination as the cards on the table are unknown until you traverse them when it comes to combat and tactics it's all on you to know when to block, when to attack, and when to run. Step on a card and you may get a boost to your money, a travelling salesman may be passing by, or you may get ambushed in your sleep by goblins who steal your favorite weapon. Regardless of the incidents manage your health, your gear, and your food well and you may stay alive long enough to defeat the boss at the end of each dungeon and earn some excellent rewards for your next trip through.

												I will first start off with, most of my hours in this game have been out of steam in offline mode. And many more have been sunk into it since this reviewHand of Fate is by far one of the most original games i have come across in a very long time.you construct you deck after you complete the first encounter with jack of dust.your deck is the dungeon and the encounters you have along the way to the boss.food is used for each move you make so the more food you have the more moves you can do.upon an encounter with an enemy it goes into a world where you fight the monster cards drawn.the fighting style is very much like the fluid fighting system from the arkham games where in you aim at your next target and your hero will zip accross to that enemy and proceed to beat em down. the counter system works similar to arkham too where an icon pops up above the offending enemies head and you hit Q if have a sheild block and counter with that.in my personal opinion upon completion this game is going to start a new GENRE of dungeon crawling hack and slashes.even though it is in early access it is still a pretty polished game given its current phase of completion. 10/10 give it a go i don't think you will be dissapointed.

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Hand of Fate Peek (Early Access Review) 

			Views: 2,776		

			An in-depth peek, towards Hand of Fate, a mixture of dungeon crawler, third-person brawler and some smaller deck building elements thrown into the mix, brought to you by SwashbucklingSir.		

The aesthetics of Hand of Fate are undoubtedly stellar. The high quality ranges from great sketches for every card, to beautiful 3D graphics as soon as the brawling starts. Most notably here are the lighting and special effects that manage to bring the whole scenery to life. Especially the fight against the Queen of Dust did impress me with its flying sand everywhere. Hand of Fate makes it abundantly clear that the overall aesthetics are not meant to be overlooked and it succeeds in creating a very appealing style overall.Almost the same could be said about the sound design of Hand of Fate. The dungeon master for example is exquisitely voice acted, the effects give precise feedback and underline every nook and cranny. Sadly, all of the event texts are not voice acted and have to be read, which is understandable in terms of budget for voice acting, however sad due to the competent voice actor already in the game. Since the music is mainly meant to create an atmospheric background noise instead of carrying emotion or story, it is competent in what it tries to achieve, however forgettable. All in all, the sound design of Hand of Fate is very good, could however be improved in terms of the quantity of voice acting.Let’s delve into the rather unique gameplay mixture of Hand of Fate. For every story adventure you start, not taking the endless mode into account, you prepare two deck of cards. On the left hand side the equipment that can be found during your dungeon crawling. Which consists not only of stronger weapons, but also of armour, helmets, gloves, rings, artefacts and trinkets. Ideally you would want to include cards specifically against a certain type of enemy that you suspect to encounter, however I mostly threw in new cards that I had not used before to keep the game experience fresh. On the right hand side of the decks, you can select the encounters that you want to possibly face during your adventure. Hereby it is important that some encounters cannot be removed until you fulfil certain conditions. The same procedures holds true as previously: I mainly selected encounters that I did either not face before to keep experiencing new content or that I did not manage to complete previously. As soon as you are satisfied with your decks, you start the story. Depending on the boss you plan to encounter at the end of the adventure, the card dealer adds some fixed cards into the mix, indicated by their purple tint and as soon as all decks are shuffled the game begins.The dungeon master begins by laying down the encounters face down in a randomly selected pattern. Now you strife to reveal the final boss and defeat said enemy to claim victory of this part of the story. Your character is indicated as golden statue and you always move by one card either horizontally or vertically hereby consuming one food, healing a bit and revealing the encounter you step on. One possible card is the choose-your-own-adventure style encounters, whereby you select an option and more often than not the final result is determined by your selection of one of four cards, ranging from huge success to huge failure and thus affecting the outcome rather randomly. While the encounters themselves are fun at their core, I do see a problem in the random nature of selection as there is no skill or learning involved from the player’s side and thus it fails to feel rewarding when selecting success and at the same time also unreasonably punishing when you hit that huge failure card, especially when this ends up costing you your weapon just before facing the final boss. I would have preferred a system similar to how FTL manages random encounters by which certain abilities or other pre-collected items can affect the outcome positively.Another possible encounter is one of the multiple combat scenarios. This is where the third person brawling comes into play and the graphical fidelity turns up several notches. Depending on the encounter or just by random selection you will be spawned into one of several arenas together with a bunch of enemies and possibly even traps. These short brawling segments are highly reminiscent of the Batman Arkham series without being as fluent and as responsive. Make no mistake, the brawling in itself is good, however the animations are not quite as top notch as the basically perfect ones of the Arkham games. Also, at least in the first three hours, the combat is not as strategic and as deep as the inspiration. Hand of Fate mainly relies on counter-attacking on green indicators and dodging on red indicators, while there are only very few special moves or strategic approaches to the combat in itself. This problem obviously arises as the game relies on random generation and thus you are always dependent to create enemies that could be faced with the basic equipment, while other story-driven games can later on throw enemies into your way that require you to use the latest acquired item or special move and the like. To summarise, the brawling is competent and refreshing, however does feel repetitive after a while. A perfect example for this is the spawning animation. While it is highly enjoyable the first few times your character spawns and gets all his equipment step by step and lastly your huge hammer falls from the sky just before you charge the flabbergasted and underpowered bandits, after a couple of hours game time though, I wished this animation could be skipped or disabled entirely, as it eats up so much time, especially when going from combat to combat encounter and thus this delay turns to be obnoxious rather quickly. Oh, and speaking of annoying, the camera cannot be rotated while in the combat arena, which can lead to some weird angles and fighting directions. Hopefully that will be fixed in the future.After defeating the final boss at the end of the adventure or by dying in between due to combat or starvation, the tokens you collected along the way are opened and thus new cards are unlocked, keeping the encounters fresh and empowering your equipment for future approaches. With these new cards you start the cycle over again, selecting a new boss, adapting your decks and facing the latest random encounters you selected beforehand.All in all, Hand of Fate is a beautiful, very competent mixture of dungeon crawling choose-your-own-adventure, third person brawling and deck building, with a few flaws in between. Nonetheless, Hand of Fate is one of the best Steam Early Access games I have played and I am very much looking forward to future improvements, which in my opinion should mainly target the repetitive combat, possibly granting you permanent special moves every few defeated bosses and thus creating more depth and tactical approaches overall.UPDATEAs I now played a little more and stand before the Queen of Skulls, I must say that the further the game progresses, the more infuriating the random nature becomes. There are several encounters with three failure cards resulting in severe penalties like losing 50 health and 30 permanent health, basically rendering the whole remaining adventure impossible. Also, due to the entirely random nature of encounters, it happened multiple times that I died on the first floor. If the brawling would be a bit tighter and more fluent overall, I am rather sure that you could go through these encounters with ease, however for example a ranged attack from close up is impossible to block and if enemies swarm you, there is a good chance that an unblockable attack will it you while you are countering another one. All in all, Hand of Fate is still a good game, however the further I progress (now over 4 hours played) the less fun I have, thus I now doubt the longevity of this dungeon crawler.			"

												TL:DR Great game, unique premise, tonnes of replayability. One of the few kickstarter success stories, definitely worth your time and money.Basically, the premise of the game is that you are playing a card game against ""The Dealer"", the game is based around ""Encounter"" cards, this may be you finding a treasure chest but needing to go through a series of obstacles to get to it, being ambushed by skeletons or going to a demon clubhouse and gambling your soul after getting drunk. There are loads of them and they are very varied.The encounters usually come in sets, miniture stories that unlock as you complete each card in the sequence, which is dead cool and a good reason to keep unlocking cards. For every action in an encounter (that isn't directly combat) you pick from a set of four dealer shuffled cards, which indicate how much you failed or succeeded at the action, which adds a nice RNG element to the game (you can follow the card shuffle with your eyes, so not ENTIRELY luck based) and keeps things interesting.Your characters equipment and blessings/curses can also interact with some of the encounters, suprising me even 20+ hours in with new paths in the old cards I thought I knew. Even once you are finished with the story there is an endless mode which uses all the cards you have unlocked to create a neverending run which gets harder the longer you play. The replay value is huge.The combat is Arkham styled (counter system and very flowy in how you move between enemies), here the equipment from encounters will really come into play, it's fairly simple in terms of what you can do but gets quite tactical, as the battlegrounds can have traps and the enemies get harder and more complex as the game goes on. The dealers starts adding curses and difficult encounters to the deck, making the later levels very difficult.The game never feels like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or cheating, pretty much every encounter can be run away from/refused and the combat can be difficult but it never feels like any enemy is particularly over powered, it's always down to your own skill. Due to the huge number of encounters and equipment, your freedom to choose and balance risk/reward, and the RNG element every run feels unique, the only downside I would add is that the combat is fairly simplistic, but considering this is an indie development, it's a very impressive accomplishment.One of the few kickstarter success stories, definitely worth your time and money.

Early Access Review
								This game has a wonderfull strangeness about it. You go through a dungeon, gaining equipment, and fighting random encounters, much akin to a Roguelike. It's a deckbuilding game, wherein your decks, are built, by you to choose what encounters and equipment you are going to encounter. Simple Batman like controls, and you have yourself something that plays rather smooth, and is kinda neat. Later dungeons add elements such as curses and blessings that can change the way you handle it, giving you a much different way of approaching things. For instance, one of the games, in which I lost gold based on health remaining.  Do I forsake food, so that I can lower my health, as to not lose gold to buy things? Do I rely on my combat mastery to survive? Should I sell this item now, knowing I may well lose the excess gold left over from what I want to buy?  A simple thing can change it up quite a bit.But then there's the atmosphere. This game has a wonderful sense of mystery to it. It's dark, illuminated by candles, told in a haze. It is you vs. a mage who is playing cards that are symbolic of encounters from your past. The narration for him sells it very hard. His comments about what you do, the achievements you just got, how he feels about the cards,  and if you can handle them. As the sole talking bit of the game, he is fantastic, and his voice fits perfectly.  With a large amount of card unlocks, variable outcomes, and an atmosphere that I cannot emphasize enough, this game is something else. It was well worth breaking my Early Access embargo on it.			"

												Hand of Fate is the perfect card game: everything revolves around doing your best with the cards you have, whenever they're good or bad (mostly bad). It's an interesting mix of deck building, rogue-like elements, dungeon crawling and third person action during battles. You build a deck of events, that will build the path of the dungeons, and of equipments, the rewards you'll get for successful encounters: sometimes you'll have to fight, sometimes you'll have to 'roll a dice', sometimes you'll have to make the right choice. It's a very interesting and well developed concept. Of course the Dealer will do his best to make things worse for you, but as he says ""The game is fair and you'll be defeated fairly"".Hand of Fate has a well built learning curve and difficulty curve, knowing when to challenge you and how to do that. Sometimes you'll get frustrated by unfair conditions (like fighting twelve enemies in a small arena), but that's part of the rogue-like nature. I LOVED the atmosphere and the monologues of the Dealer, a very charismatic and interesting character: his presence alone is worth buying the game if you ask me. There are a couple of downsides, mostly regarding the battle system: a targeting system and a health bar above the enemies would have been useful and made the battle less chaotic; a couple of collisions are off and a very limited number of arenas have some visibility issues in certain points. All around it's a great game, if you like mixing the chance of card games with the risks of rogue-likes. It could use some polishing, but its atmosphere and concept are so fantastic that you can overlook it.8,5/10			"

												Possibly one of my favorite games! I won't go into all the details, theres enough reviews for that, just here to say that this is an amazing game, and definitely worth full price in my opinion. Here is why:PROS:- This game is based on both luck, skill, a small amount of tactics, and then luck again. These factors combined give a, to me, unrivalled sense of accomplishment upon reaching the final floor of a level. (Though thats posdibly due to me not usually playing rogue-likes)- It's vastly replayable. I've been stuck on the final boss for at least three hours already, I've rage quited twice, and yet every time I start it back up right away to give it another go, because even the same level is never the same. And then there's endless mode...- Extremely interesting design. Just look at the trailer and other descriptions. Enough said.- Better than Telltale when it comes to immersing you in an engaging story. Each time you gain a token you just can't wait to find out what kind of card it will unlock next.- The dealer. I will just get in on the hype and mention, like everyone else, hoe great the voice acting on this guy is.CONS:(Seriously, just get the game)- The dealer again. Though his voice acting is great, after 30 hours of play he gets a bit repetitive. Only slightly anoying though. And probably just to me.- If you rage quite by Alt-F4'ing because you died during battle you start on the card you were standing on in the turn before the battle, making it possible to try again in the same session. Don't abuse this. Just don't. It kills the rogue-like ferl.- Charity VI. You'll know what I mean once you unlock it. Do I look like Jesus to you? I can't do that trick with the bread and the fish y' know...			"

The game drops frames to unplayable degrees in the later, more cluttered fights). That aside, now that I have this on PC and can run at a stable 60, this game does nothing but shine in my eyes. An incredibly fun choose-your-own-adventure, deck builder amd RPG with Arkham-Style combat. The voice acting is great, the art style is incredible (very Fable-esque) and the game has high replayability.

It's interesting that it's a rogue-like, so every run is different.The RPG elements about you developing your character for the last fight of each mission is also fun to play with. You can unlock new cards by doing specific card quests / encounters route too.But the combat system feel sooooo clunky. It's so slow. You get kind of used to it though, but by the end of the last boss, I was done with it.6/10 still worth the $6 I paid for it though.			"

												A fun, Deck building fighter, with RPG elements.I really enjoy the concept behind this game but the combat is a bit of a joke if i'm totally honest. Its very similar to the Batman games in the button layout/character movement when fighting, so if you've ever played any of the Arkham games you'll feel instantly at home. I say It's a joke because i think out of roughly 50 fights i've had possibly 1 maybe 2 last longer than 30 seconds. Not slagging it off as such, because honestly I'm enjoying it, it's just a little easy.If you're looking for a laid-back, fun-time game that isn't too taxing and can be played with a controller, this could be what you're after.

												This game is truly an incredible surprise.  It is only a card game in the sense that there are random elements and you get to pick some of the deck those elements are drawn from.  It is only an action game in the sense that you play the encounters you draw, but these encounters are not as tiresome and repetitive as in most 3D action brawlers.  It is only a RPG in the sense that you pick, sell, buy, and loot equipment with different properties and you can choose a ""fate"" for your character that changes the rules of the game.  But if you take those pieces and put them together, and add in elements of choose-your-own-adventure and rogue-likes, you get a unique, fun, changing game with beautiful presentation.  If you only tried it in early access, try it again.  I was shocked when I went back to this in my library.			"

												Halfway through the game I can recommend (when on sale) to those interested in a combination strategy/rouge experience. The strategy part isn't that deep however; mostly you have to decide how to keep enough food and health (and get some good gear) to reach the boss. Beat the boss, and start fresh on each new level. Though there isn't that much variety in turns of battling (bascially move really fast/dodge/attack, repeat), there is enough skill challenge to keep it fairly interesting. Hand of Fate is more than the sum of its parts: everything comes together to give you 12 short and relatively enjoyable rouge-like levels in story mode. Chance has more of an effect in your ability to beat a level than most games, and sometimes luck will go against you. Only had really bad luck in one level out of 6 so far, which perhaps means the odds are stacked in the player's favor. Three consecutive pain cards was indeed painful; lost 60 health right before boss, lost boss battle, needed to repeat entire level.     7/10: Would randomnly lose 60 health again.			"

												    - Short version: Truly an inspiring, creative, fun game. Beware though, this is not a card game. Yes the theme is about card games but the combat is the 50% of the gameplay and it is the ultimate deciding factor between the win or loss condition. Definately watch a gameplay video of Totalbiscuit or whatever before purchasing!!! aside from that, this is totally worth the purchase.    - Long version: Although the price seems a tad bit high, you will probably feel like the game deserves it in the first 30 minutes of gameplay. The theme is laid out elegantly, voice acting, soundtrack and the general atmosphere is just amazing.      You get to create your own deck of possibilities (cards are events). Your decisions and sometimes mere chance decides the outcome of that event. Events can sometimes turn into a battle ( AC style 3rd person combat style) .     Combat is the 50% of this game in the beginning. However in the later stages of the game, the strategy, deck-building and the choices made outside of the combat is the bigger deciding factor. So its safe to say that combat is probably around 25% of importance once you get better at it.   ---------------PROS:       *  TONS of replay value. (This is the part that deserves the full price);         *  Awesome presentation. Artwork just fits with the theme like a glove;      *  Great gameplay mechanics. Combats last as long as they should, no more or less;       *  Simple UI design is just relaxing, the game has almost no menu's or complicated screens;      *  Most importantly, The game makes you want to play again, and again, and again...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CONS:       * Combat. This game would be PERFECT withouth combat (or at least with different styles) . I can't describe the exact reason but the game is just too perfect ""on the table"" with the atmosphere, that I want to sit on that table, face to face with the dealer. Combat feels like a chore, something to get out of the way before I can come back. It just feels like a break from the actual game. Totally breaks the immersion for me.      *  In the story mode, everything builds up to combat, and resolves with the outcome of the combats (or at least the final combat). God I just wish cards would be a little bit more important. (not just determining the variables of combat)     Overall: A perfect game for some, but not the game for everyone. Has its own style. Really original ideas that should not be missed out. Worth the purchase  "

												It is hard to put this game into words that describe it well. It is in some way a deck building / card game, but all fights are conducted as hack&slay 3rd person fights where the moves are a bit similar to the batman games (evade, counter, attack, some special skills). So what happens in a standard round of Hand of Fate?1. I select a story / main quest to play2. I select a preset deck and review it to exchange cards3. Play (the following steps a & b repeat multiple times):3.a. Move your character across a map made of cards which are revealed upon reaching them. These may then trigger sidequests, encounters, shops, traps etc. They come along with stories where you can often choose how to react to an encounter, which gives you different results.3.b. In case you engage in a fight, you go into the battle mode. This is classic hack and slay action with block, dodge, attack.4. You complete the round by beating the final boss (or dying). During 3. you have completed many events that gave you tokens. These unlock future side quests, weapons or other cards to be used in future rounds. So once done, go back to step 2, to make use of your sweet loot!I really enjoy RPGs, good progression systems, deckbuilding and a fresh gamestyle. In my opinion, Hand of Fate combines these mechanisms into an oh so refreshing and satisfying experience that anyone with similar preferences should not miss!			"

												Graphics: I was satisfied with the graphics, they fit the theme very well and are easy on the eyes.Gameplay: Incredibly addicting. The adventure-as-a-card-game theme worked beautifully and you get a real sense of progression: 1) In each individual game you build up hoards of equipment/blessings/gold/food as you move from encounter to encounter.  2) In the overarching game you collect new tokens that unlocks new encounters/equipment as you complete the story mode and also as you trudge along in the endless mode. The combat is crisp and controls are reasonably well implemented. There are occassional frustrations with the non-controllable / constantly-chaning camera angles that messes up your combat movements but they are bearable.The game give players a good challenge that ramps up as you move further into the game (especially in endless mode).  The balance is a good one - you'll never feel so overpowered that you get bored. No matter how much equipment / gold / food you accumulate, everything can change in a second with a bad encounter or curse in the late game.  In the beginning, everything's easy and the loot rains down with very forgiving bad encounters. Towards the late-game of endless mode, when you're decked out with all the good equipment and blessings and gold and food, the game really ramps up the consequences such as losing multiple equipments in a single bad encounter, get 10+ curses thrown on you (one for each ring you have and players are generally encouraged to hoard all the different rings they can buy/find because the effects stack), or get thrown in a gladiator pit with no equipment to help you out in the battle (did I mention that the monsters are usually powered up 2-3 times already at this point due to accumulating curses?).Story:No real story to the game, though the backstory (or at least hints of it) of the dealer and game itself can be interesting for a bit as the dealer provides cryptic comments. Each game is a create-your-own adventure that is formed by all the encounters you experience.Replay Value:Extremely high. No two games are alike and it'll take you 30-40+ hours to unlock all the tokens and see all the equipment/encounters that the game has to offer.Other:Hand of Fate and FTL are the two games that really perked my interest in rogue-like games. Their take on genre are different but both are highly effective in that they immerse you into the game, give you a good challenge, and provides a lot of unpredictability / replay value.  Also, the voice acting in this game is quite good as well.Overall:I found the gameplay incredibly addicting and would highly recommend this to fans of RPG, action. or rogue-like genre.			"

												""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.""This game is a living testament to that.  The cards and mechanics are simple and generic, the combat experience is average with little to no depth, and after a few hours, the narrator begins to repeat himself.  And yet, Hand of Fate is an excellent game!  I love this game!  This game could have been a glorified series of mediocre minigames, but it's not because the designers made painstaking efforts to how the game felt.  You don't need the coolest monsters, the most interesting mechanics, or the greatest story to make the game great.  Convenient ui and the tarot atmosphere (and, dear God, I LOVE the narrator!) made all the difference.			"

Once I understood that, and released myself from an RPG mindset, I enjoyed it much more.You do *not* develop a character in the traditional RPG style. Instead, you build a deck that you pull from for each 'episode'.For example: You found a wonderful weapon that you equpied during your last adventure. For your next adventure, it is not a piece of equipment to start with - but rather a possible piece of equipment that you may find on the current adventure.The sense of progress comes not from developing your character, but instead from adding to the possibilities your character will have.If and when you can understand and accept that mechanic the game will become an adventure with each play.It also has an action combat mechanic - whenever you encounter enemy cards you will often be shifted to another game mode where you have to battle these enemies arcade style.Rather random, slightly challenging, and in my opinion, replayable enough to keep me wondering what will be next.Recommended for those who like - deck building, medium randomness, and replayability.Not recommended for those who - want RPG like character progression, want one play mode, get frustrated with ""bad luck"".

												Halfway through the game I can recommend (when on sale) to those interested in a combination strategy/rouge experience. The strategy part isn't that deep however; mostly you have to decide how to keep enough food and health (and get some good gear) to reach the boss. Beat the boss, and start fresh on each new level. Though there isn't that much variety in turns of battling (bascially move really fast/dodge/attack, repeat), there is enough skill challenge to keep it fairly interesting. Hand of Fate is more than the sum of its parts: everything comes together to give you 12 short and relatively enjoyable rouge-like levels in story mode. Chance has more of an effect in your ability to beat a level than most games, and sometimes luck will go against you. Only had really bad luck in one level out of 6 so far, which perhaps means the odds are stacked in the player's favor. Three consecutive pain cards was indeed painful; lost 60 health right before boss, lost boss battle, needed to repeat entire level.     7/10: Would randomnly lose 60 health again.			"

								I will not comment on game play, since that has probably been explained a million times over in other reviews and videos. But this I will say:The Dealer is your Narrator, as well as your Savior and your Opponent. He has offered you the chance to play his Game. As the Player, you are in charge of a pawn - a nondescript adventurer. You are given cards upon which the Game is played. You build the pawn's equipment deck, and the story's encounter deck. The Dealer will deal out the cards and lead you on an incredible tale of greed, hubris and honor. Your pawn will face endless, faceless foes as well as specific boss villains. There will be violence, traps, treasure and horror. The Dealer will attempt to entice you to send your pawn into situations most peril for the offer of a few tokens. These tokens unlock more cards, which unlock more adventure and equipment/treasure.And as you defeat each boss villain, the Dealer will put the card into his cabinet, where you will be able to choose the next villain. Defeat a row of villains, gain a special item. But beware, every Game, every card, every victory will add to the complexity and danger that your pawn will face as you struggle to reach and win the final Game. Your pawns will die, but never fear - there are countless pawns waiting for you to guide them. Who is this man in the robe, who created these cards that influence a world, individuals and items? Who are you, Player? Are we Gods who are meant to play with the lives of mortals? Maybe.You'll have play to experience it.			"

												Hand of Fate is a fantastic blend of Adventure, RNG, rouge-like and card games. I picked this game up recently on sale for a steal and it was worth every cent. The introduction to the game is simple and easy to follow allowing you to pick up the game quickly and play at your own pace. As you play the game you step from card to card in stages and deal with a number of random events including; battles, moral choices, ethical choices, gambling, quests and visiting shops while progressing through the stage towards the goal of a boss fight. The main story consists of 12 stages each with a boss of its own. All heading towards a final 13th stage that you will not be prepared for the first time. Around about the time you defeat the 4th boss you will unlock a game mode called ""endless"". Endless mode is never ending stages progressively getting harder until you can go no further. I suppose the goal is around stage 30 as this is the achievement awarding level. I personally was never able to beat my record of stage 26. It gets seriously rough. The addition of ""endless"" mode allows you to unlock more cards/ rewards as you complete each cards requirement which can then be used in both story mode and endless. A great addition to the game is the ability to edit the ""world"" or ""level"" by using the deck builder which is available basically at the start of the game. Once you have an idea for the game, the events and items you have preference for you are able to open the deck builder before a main story level and adjust it to your specific liking. The game does offer an auto recommended deck which is fine but once you hit that final 13th level you will most likely need to adjust the deck to your specific play and equipment style. Overall I had a great time with this game, an interesting story, great narration/ music and a play style that was addictive, punishing and rewarding. If this sounds even remotely interesting to you I would suggest you pick it up and give it a try. I loved my time spent on Hand of Fate and I couldn't recommend it enough.			"

												My overall rating for Hand of Fate: 100/100Hand of Fate is something I was missing for a long time. Card deckbuidling game mixed with RPG-games, all hidden in a rogue-like coat. The game is hard, shows no mercy, yet is enjoyable as hell. Let's see why.GAMEPLAY+ Card game base+ Real-time fights+ Roguelike board game+ Various encounters+ Cards are changing and getting more difficult+ Strategy needs to be changed a lot+ Well made DLCs!o Sometimes clunky controls (training is needed :-D )- Luck is needed (lack of it can be potential game-ender)Gameplay is based on solving cards, either through choices, or you have to deal with threat personally in combat. As you progress further, game becomes more and more difficult, but there is one thing that has to be cleared. Game is rogue-like, so if it seems unfair to you, then it is right and you have to try your luck. That can be frustrating sometimes, because hardly defeatable encounter with full gear can be your first card in dungeon! Anyway, both DLCs added some cards and new strategies to defeat upcoming challenges. Still, with all possibilities, the game is a step ahead. Bugged achievements got fixed, so good luck!VISUALS+ Marvelous art style+ Formidable combat + Backgrounds and battlefields- Minor bugs and glitchesThere is nothing I can complain about visual style. Cards are stylish, they are looking like an old card game played in some mysterious temple. The atmosphere is mystical and full of tension and expectations. Combat is also perfectly created, though, some creatures might get bugged after hits, but that seems more funny than annoying to me.CHARACTERS+ Dealer and Warrior+ StoryIt is a game of life and death. Just the Dealer and unknown Warrior. Nothing more or less. Perfect.SOUNDTRACK+ Arabic-style songs+ Credit songJeff van Dyck showed us many excellent performances and this music belongs to one of his best. Arabic-themed songs are adding its piece to whole impression of this mystical game. My favourites - Life and Death, Welcome to the Game, Deal of the Millenia, Dead Skin, Dune Storm, Hand of Fate (Instrumental) and Hand of Fate.SUMMARYCard game with real fights, what more can be desired? With music of that kind and perfect voice-acting it was a pleasure to play and discover the secrets of this game. And also to return to it again. Many mysteries were revealed and more are awaiting to be. But is it possible? Let's find out. Perhaps ;-)			"

												This is a great game, and definitely worth the money, although getting it on sale makes it a no-brainer.It's essentially a dungeon crawler where your equipment and encounters are determined at random by the cards you put in your deck.  The challenges get progressively harder but are relatively easy until about 2/3 of the way through, when the difficulty ramps up considerably.  The combat is akin to a slightly less polished Batman-esque attack, doge, shield bash type affair, it's still quite fun.  Voices, music, and sound are all pretty good, but is that really the reason you're buying this thing?  The game is probably good for about 15 hours for a playthrough.The negatives have been touched on in other reviews but those that stand out to me are the ""fate"" based challenges you'll encounter here or there.  It's true that, at a certain point, getting the right card (success or fail) becomes a complete guessing game.  This negative in no way detracts from an otherwise awesome game.  While the randomness may bother some people, the game is called Hand of FATE, and that last word really sums it all up.  All in all, tons of fun, highly recommended.			"

												This game is pretty amazing.  Good combination of ""Magic the Gathering"" crossed with action-combat and great story telling.  As I get farther into the ""story mode"" I continue to be surprised at how the cards I'm gathering keep getting intertwined into the story.For example, one ""artifact"" card that I came across had the ability during combat to turn my character etheral preventing damage.  During the story part this affect could be used to skip over a tentacle trap without risk.			"

												Tabletop, roguelike, RPG, TCG, third person action RPG... Add it all up and what do you get?A strange, yet extremely fitting merge of genres, with beautiful use of lighting, shading, art and music.Not only does it look and sound amazing, but it plays even better, with an amazingly well designed deck building system that allows you to, in a sense, build your own adventure with equipment and encounters alike, all while the dealer throws his own tricks into the mix.You can take on every challenge, blade in hand, with a battle cry as you rip through your foes, or you can lower your weapon and offer your food and gold to help villagers, and your actions change the outcome, and in some cases, the reward. Hand of Fate isn't trying to do a lot of things, but what it does, it does well. Easy to use deck building system, or an automatic option for those not interested in the deck building.A very basic ""map"" screen, where your adventure takes place, yet with more than enough depth to keep you engaged and thinking about your actions, with food, gold, equipment, and curses.A very basic combat area, yet once again, with a surprising amount of depth, and a little planning sometimes, with the use of artifacts, curses, blessing, and enchanted equipment. If you have any interest in Hand of Fate, and are deciding if you should buy it. Do it. I cannot recommend this game enough, especially if you're a fan of roguelike elements.			"

								Quite an interesting game that is part deckbuilding TCG and part Arkham City's combat engine. The random nature of the game and path toward your goal, along with building your deck to make that journey easier on you, makes the replay value surprisingly high. As you progress you unlock more enemies to fight, dangers to face, and equipment to find or purchase from vendors.As Early Access games go, I'm not even sure why it's considered Early Access, this already seems like a full fledged game worth it's pricetag. Highly recommended for those that want to take a risk on something fun and interesting.			"

								This game is 1/3 card building, 1/3 psuedo adventure, and 1/3 3rd person combat. In this game you construct 2 decks, one is for equipment and the other is for encounters. then you those these decks to arm yourself(equipment deck) and the ""game board"" is constructed out of your enounter deck. This game is a rogue like and combines risk and reward into a interesting rpg senario. The big issue for me was this game requires a controller to play becuase the keyboard/mouse controls are pretty bad, but with a game pad its pretty good. It is possible to play witha keyboard and mouse but is awkward.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm not much of a reviewer, let alone one for passing on my opinion of games onto others (since it's highly subjective).However, this game is so original & unique its compels me to do so. In an industry that has become highly itterative, Hand of Fate combines tried and true fighting game mechanics with a rogue-lite/dungeon-crawler and blends it into an original package with ""trading"" card game mechanics.The combat is a cross between Batman: Arkham City and Witcher 2. It has the style of combat from Arkham (different enemies do different attacks, organizing which enemies to eliminate first, counter system) but it has the pace of Witcher, in that it is quite slow and you cannot constantly spam the counter button, but instead must really time your attacks and counters. In addition, in this game you are not invincible, each strike landed on you will take away 5-10 health and your health persists for the entire dungeon (you get +5 health regen per ""turn""). this is where my comparison to witcher makes more sense, this isnt a pure action game like Arkham, instead you must really plan the weapons and armor you take into combat, and you must manage your resources, if you run out of resources (-1 per turn) you enter starvation where you lose 10hp per turn. There is also an interesting mechanic where the instances that the game transports you to, is filled with traps that can harm you and your opponents. It a nice little touch that adds to the difficulty. As for the card game element of the game, its not like your traditional TCG like scrolls or Hearthstone, instead the cards you acquire are used to create the dungeon that you will traverse to reach the final boss, you can make an ""easy"" dungeon in some sense of the word, but that will yield very little buffs when you face the dungeon boss. Also, that strategy will limit the amount of gold you get and the Holy card buffs you receive that carryover from dungeon to dungeon. So far I've been raving about the game, but there are some grievances, mostly it comes down the combat. So far the combat is great, but this game essentially revolves around its combat system and for that it has to be flawless. My only gripe is subjective, in that it doesnt quite feel as ""tigh/responsive"" as I would prefer. In leans more towards the witcher style of combat, which is not a bad thing to say; the game just needs some polish. The devs needs to reduce the delay between pressing a button and it registering in the game. Also, at times, the enemies (usually bosses) will have canned animations that they must complete which prevents you from attacking them. Ie, they will continue slashing and NOT take damage from you while they are finishing the animation. That and the fact that the counter attack isnt always responsive does take away from the combat experience. Lastly, the camera is kind of janky and to my knowledge you cannot control it, which can be very annoying at times. However, the game is in early access, so I will give the benefit of the doubt to the devs in that they will sort these things out. Like I said, im not a ""professional"" reviewer, but the game is so unique that it deserves some attention. At the least, check out some lets plays on youtube.  Question is, is it worth it? for me, yes, at the $25 price range, even in the early access state, you can get a lot of enjoyment out of it. However, as a wise consumer, its always best to wait until the official release, but if you are a fan of the genres it combines or have some disposable cash to spend on steam, give it a shot. TLDR: Action game mixed with a rogue-lite dungeon crawler and some card-game elements. Combat is a mix of Batman: arkham asylum and Witcher 2, leaning more towards Witcher. The game is actually pretty challenging, its not a superhero simulator like Batman or even Assassins Creed where you just counter continuously. If devs are reading this, find a way to add MP/CO-OP, perhaps take turns being the ""dungeon master"", the game has soooo much potential.			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access - Things are subject to change!REALLY interesting twist on rogue-lite genre that seems to be popular now with stuff like Magicite, Binding of Isaac (and Rebirth around the corner) and Nuclear Throne. Hand of Fate mixes deckbuilding with 3rd person hack and slash combat and roguelite-elements. It still is kind of barebones and kinda unresponsive, but that's early access for you. As a game It really hooked me and I did really enjoy playing this. Deckbuilding is kind of stale until you actually get more cards by beating bosses and succeeding in events.Fighting feels good and meaty and slow-mo-last-hit -effect feels amazing! Still, it isn't really too complex and mostly just spamming X to do damage, in my honest opinion the combat doesn't flow too well having quite long animations and a split-second ""stop-period"" after them if there are no enemies nearby, this makes you really vulnerable, especially if you do not have weapon with counter attacking-modifier and can cause you take lots of unnessecary damage. My biggest gripe about the game is the random element. I see what they're trying to do as drawing cards from deck for random outcome really is the games namesake, but especially early on if you draw an event that really hurts you (takes away lots of your food or health) or do not draw any weapon/armor cards at all can get REALLY frustrating. One could argue that it brings challange to game, but honestly, if how well you're doing is dependant on just pure dumb luck, it really doesn't feel good.That being said, I really don't know how that could be fixed without seriously hurting the games premise and after you beat first three bosses that is negated by little bit, but that can take way long depending on your luck, sooo-- yeah.Overall, I have high hopes about this game, I did enjoy playing it and will return to it when I have more time!

												Summary / Mechanics- This is a randomized dungeon crawler in which your encounters are embodied by cards.- For completing an encounter in a special way you can unlock its follow-up encounter and new equipment.- This game has permanent progression in the way that you can enhance your card deck (encounters and equipment) with your new cards.- Combat is real time slash/counter/dodge action (batman-like), with more depth once you have weapons and artifacts with special powers.Characters / Quests(Edit: The different Characters are part of the Wildcard-Addon, didn't know that because I bought in Early Access)- There are several playable characters (visual differences only through equipment) that each have some pros and cons, and each adds special cards to your deck.- 3 of them are the equivalents to easy/normal/hard modes, the other ones enable different play styles and offer unique challenges.- Each character has his own questline that is linked to their profession and special abilities.- Quests are successions of encounters (some branch out), you will complete them over several rounds of gameplay.- Quest encounters have a coherent story and reward you equipment that was featured in the quest etc.Game ModesStory mode- For every ""level"" you have to clear a number of dungeon floors and fight a boss- Each level will let you start with different gifts and curses, so that there are varying challenges- After every third level you will gain better starting equipment but enemies will get tougherEndless mode- Endless dungeon floors, highscore mode.- In this mode you don't build a deck, it uses all cards.- Every floor will add tougher cards to the enemy card deck and you will get a random punishment.- You can use this mode to complete quests (and get better cards for your story deck) or play the character quests without the additional difficulty of the later story mode levels.Recommendation:If you are interested in game mechanics or like card and tabletop games, GET THIS			"

												Surprisingly good.  Very unique.  You move around a board made up of cards with each card representing an encounter.  The encounters are randomly selected based on your own ""deck"" that you put together and those selected for your by the computer based on what mode you're playing.  The encounters are comprised of a bit of text that tells you what's going on and then you will either have a selection of options based on the encounter, a ""chance"" card selection where you pick a card and it tells you weather it's a ""success"", ""failure"" and such.  If you encounter monsters you go into a 3d, real time combat arena where you battle the creatures.  The battles are actually really fun for something so simple.   While moving around the board you need to manage gold for quests and shops, food that gets comsumed from each move as well as encounters and your equipment that helps you in a myriad of ways throughout the game.You have to try it.

								Many developers set out with clever genre-crossover ideas, and this may not be the cleverest but it is by far the best executed. The card system doesnt feel like its forced onto the arena-fighting element, nor do the rogue-like elements are not ever compromised for the sake of story or the card mechanic. The game has the same replayability of games like Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy. Even simple things like ""draw 2 gain cards"" (each of which is slightly different) instead of just ""gain 10 gold"" make you glad nobody else thought to make this game first. And if they did and I just don't know about them, they probably didnt make as smooth (or graphically impressive) a game as this.As for the mob-fighting type of combat that people keep comparing to the Batman: Arkham series, dont let that scare you off. Its not the 'repeatedly tap x' kind of fighting, but a type of combat were you still have the cool animations of batman, but you actually need to control your character's direction and time your attacks and counters.This game would still be the best digital-card-game/rpg/rogue-like/text-adventure/arena-fighter even there were two of them.10/10			"

I love this game to death.The gameplay is the best part of this game, the game can twist and turn any which way when your progress is lead by pure luck. The way the card system works is very simple and easy to wrap your mind around. The combat is excellent and fluid, it's awesome to watch. The combat isn't just hacking and slashing, it's about timing blocks and dodging opponents you can't fight all at once. The combat is reminscent to the first Fable, in fact, much of this game really is a Fable game without the brand name, but the combat is so much more interesting here than in any Fable.The graphics are lush and colourful. It has that wonderful atmospheric fantasy mood that Fable set so perfectly.The sound quality is top notch for the most part. There is a few times when the sound does cut out but a simple restart fixes that immediately. The soundtrack is awesome and really has an epic vibe to it. I was even thinking of buying it if it's sold on Steam. It's one of those soundtracks that'll take me back years from now. I love the clanging of the swords and the thumping of swords against shields. The voice actor behind the Dealer is on the same level of deep and mesmerizing as Morgan Freeman. He's like an English Morgan Freeman, I can't stress enough how good of a voice actor he is.The story line is interesting, it's not a normal storyline. You enter at the end of the adventurer's story. This is a retelling of all his adventures. So it's a game about retrospective and reflection. The Dealer makes very interesting remarks and ponderings that make me think on a philosophical level. What kind of game does that?I love a game that I can put hundreds and hundreds of hours into. A game that has endless replayability and isn't limited by just having a storyline. This is one of those games. It doesn't ever have to end. There's an endless mode. There's also 200+ cards to collect. Each card is an encounter. Every game randomizes these encounters and even throws in some that benefit you and some that debilitate you to a certain extent. This game definitely earns its pay and has lot of bang for very little buck.If you're on the fence about getting it, don't be. This game isn't hard to fall in love with. I'd recommend this game to absolutely anyone. "

								You will need a contoller. You will roll a lot. You will feel overwhelmed by unfair odds.And you won't care.You will be back again and again unlocking more and more cards, becasue the game is simply VERY GOOD.I read the negative reviews first, looking for a solid reason not to buy. And voted them all down. Why, becasue they are so indvidually picky, they don't at all TELL me why not to buy this game. Whereas, READ the positive reviews, and FEEL the fun the player base is having.Buy it, Play it, Enjoy it. Recomend it. If the Devs continue with DLC or part 2, I will support it for Yrs to come. It's FUN.Oh but please make the blasted Chance cards move slower, just a TINY bit :)			"

												The care and attention which has gone into crafting this game - from music to voice over to the little touches in how the graphics are handled - show an incredible amount of love not normally encountered in modern games. With the addition of being bug free, it's an absolute pleasure to dip in and out of. The mechanics are interesting, the randomisation makes replayability a joy, and endless mode is an interesting challenge. One or two obtuse mechanics do exist, but there is strategy in the gameplay, and the combat, though essentially an arcade element, is also entertaining because it is fulfilled in short bursts. Not necessarily the kind of game that addicts you to play in long sessions, the game takes a different approach with enough intriguingness to make you come back. One for the library.What's it worth? £12 / $15			"

I took a break from the game after having completed most of the achivments.I have started playing this game again after all these frequent FREE updates,.The short review is that this game is by far the best card game here on steam.It is an combination of luck, skill, determination and frustration (in a good way)If you play this game and learn well, you can easaly complete the game with just the basic equipment. THis proves that skills play a huge part in this game and that is good, eliminating the luck factor. But hey, Full dragon equipment is always fun :)10/10			"

								If you are looking for a fantastic Fantasy/RPG card game look no further. You get to customize your deck of cards to fit your playstyle. You play as a hero who is trying to make it through all of the trials and tribulations of a warrior, all that matters is defeating the next boss (and eventually the main boss a.k.a the dealer of cards). Every card you draw can either help you or hurt you, it is very random. Whatever you end up drawing will be the equipment you end up with. The randomness of what you can get is what makes this game so appealing.        There are small battles in which you can physically take controll of your hero to hack and slah the enemies to death. These battles help break the monotony of just playing a card game. You might draw a good set of armor and a decent sword or you could end up with a nasty group of gremlins to fight, either way you will still end up having a blast. Once you defeat a boss you will continue unto the next boss and set of challenges untill you get to the last boss.      You earn in-game gold through defeating mobs or completeing quests. There are shops in every set of cards in which you can use this gold to buy/ sell armor, weapons, or even cure curses and heal health. You can also completely customize your equipment/encounter decks to make sure you are having the most personal experience possible.      If you are a fan of strategey games or just a card game fanatic then this is a must buy. I am not in any way partial to these types of games, yet I can't help but have a blast playing this.      If you can find this on-sale I'd say grab it no questions asked. Even if this wasn't on sale I still believe it's worth 25$. There is an enormous ammount of replayability to be had. Buy and trust me you will not regret it. -Casey "

This game was a pleasant surprise! It’s a bit or RPG Strategy mixed into a dungeon crawling type of story with some hack and slash combat. You interact with, use, or equip cards for the main aspects of the game, and gain more cards as time goes on (depending on your success/failure). If you don’t like a card, you can remove it from the deck and not play with it again later (as long as you have enough cards required for the play through).  This deck building aspect allows you to choose what possible events you encounter in your adventure.It’s hard to summarize this game without going in depth since there are so many different things from so many different genres here; however, you’re pretty likely to find something you like about the game. I will admit that it can become repetitive depending on how you arrange your deck, and the combat might turn into button spamming, but you don’t have to let it...you can play the game as you choose.What is nice about this game is that you can either go “endless”, or use the “story mode” which gives you “break points” as you finish each piece once you beat the boss at the end of the dungeon. Like I said, it’s hard to explain...but you’re bound to like at least a couple aspects of this games layout. I enjoy the dialogue from the card master quite a bit and it really adds character to the game.The Bad News:  This game is a currently an unoptimized resource hog. It has memory leak issues. After about 30 minutes of play today, Windows was asking me to close the program because it had nearly 3 GB of RAM in use and was eating resources like crazy. (It didn’t crash, but Windows noted the issue, and presented the event to me for action.)Once this game is optimized, I think it will become very popular with the gaming community.			"

												I overwhelmingly encourage anyone who enjoys 3rd person combat and dungeon crawling to pick up this game.  It's not a card game.  Not at all.  The cards are merely an environmental trapping that builds the story and setting while providing a mechanism for the encounter and monster randomization.  It's all about the dungeon crawl, planning your resource usage, and then good old fashioned 3rd person action hack and slash.  Amazingly well thought out game.  Worth every penny.			"

												Buy this!! If your're on the fence about this game (and especially if it is on sale) BUY IT!!! It is well worth the investment. It's kind of one of those easy to learn hard to master kind of games so I got sucked into it pretty fast. A good sign is that the developers are responsive to the game community. And the Dealer has a lot of dialogue (especially as you get to newer levels). Plus he's not just a bad guy - he has a complex character that you get to know. Their is a certain amount of random chance to the game (but their is too in life) and it can get a little maddening trying to get the right cards in sequence. But overall this is a good investment even if you don't like active fighting games. I didn't but now I do thanks to this game. Plus if you get stuck just go to the community board and ask. It can be very satisfying to kill a monster you had thought was unbeatable. Another nice thing is that if you really hate a card you can often just not select it. Don't always go by the Recommended deck (although I would advise that you do at first until you get a feel for the ""ropes"" and what you like). This is game is very customizable.			"

												I got this as part of a Humble Bundle and knew nothing about it before trying.I'm a huge fan of tabletop board gaming, so I was interested when it was described as a deck-builder mixed with an action combat game. The concept is really neat, but the game ultimately falls flat, in my opinion.As you'll read in other reviews, the game does have solid voice acting and graphics. I agree with those assessments, but that's about as far as I can go with the positive aspects.My biggest concern with this game is that the card gameplay is extremely shallow and random with very few interesting decisions; it's full of illusion-of-choice where the game shuffles 4 cards and you pick one -- the act of picking a single card from a shuffled pile is NOT the same as making a decision. The game ultimately feels like a fancy skin over a bunch of die rolls and linear movement. After 5 minutes of playing the game, it becomes apparent that this is the core gameplay loop.The pacing of the card gameplay is sluggish, with animations being just a tad too slow. And with so many of these animations being the same and/or with nearly inconsequential effects, it quickly feels repetetive and grindy. Couple this with the lack of decision making, and the game begins to feel like a chore.The game uses a tarot style graphic design on the cards, only showing a card name in addition to the art. The issue with that is that there are at least dozens (hundreds?) of unique cards that each do different things, and they these effects are not immediately apparent. So when you complete a mission and win a booster pack, it totally takes the excitement out of the reveal because you have no idea what you just opened. This may seem like a small detail, but it sucks out SO MUCH of the immersion and underlying story. When you have a wall of completed missions with no descriptions, the experience feels hollow.The combat is very similar to Batman. I didn't know this before playing, and if I did, I probably would have avoided the game based purely on personal preference (I didn't care for the Batman combat system). This game really tried to capture the same feel, but is again ultimately quite sluggish in its execution. As well, this combat system feels at odds with the balance of the card system. With so many opportunities to block and counter and dodge, what even is the difference between a +25 ATK weapon vs +27 ATK weapon? Part of the excitement and strategy/tactics of a more traditional card game is working out lines of play that let you edge out small victories with just enough damage in different situations. The action combat in this game blurs this aspect of gameplay to the point where it begins to feel arbitrary and lacking a cohesive design.In conclusion, even if the gameplay itself was more compelling, the user experience (card descriptions, pacing, etc) really made a mediocre/boring game into a frustrating one. I definitely do not recommend buying this at full price, and would only recommend getting it on sale if you enjoyed the combat in Batman and are intrigued by the concept of a mixed card game/action game. DO NOT buy this if you want deep card game experiences because you will be disappointed.			"

												It looks very nice, it plays very good on start but then... that absurd mix of mediocre action sequences and card game is not convincing. Maybe it is/was targeted to non-PC platforms (tablets? phones?) or whatever, but it doesn't feel good. Interest declined very very quick as it became too complicated with arbitrary rules (it's a card game so can there be any non-arbitrary rules?) that just seem to be there to make things more difficult to do, but really do not add to the thrill or interest. It's sad but true: I have to give a thumbs down despite it's excellent graphical vest.			"

												Fantastic mix of RPG, card and board-game with a Dungeons and Dragons feel and also it's own flavour, which is great. Love the sound-track, love the narrator/dealer and how the game is pretty much a random rogue-like.You basically go on an adventure to achieve certain goals, usually beating the boss of the level. Each space you move onto is a card in a deck, each piece of equipment is another card, each gain and loss, another card. All of this is packaged into a lovely game of choice, chance and action, with the game cutting to an arena-like fight so you can take control and bash some monsters!Overall, definitely worth a look if you have ever liked D&D, Board-game RPGs or card games. Cannot recommend enough.			"

												The rouge-like for people who dislike rogue-likes. Also a great game in it's own right.The combat is akin to the more recent Batman games. Not the same level of polish, but still very good. Combat is at a moderate pace and the variety of equipment (and their effects) make combat a more thoughtful endeavor, asking you how and in what order you will deal with the steadily growing variety of opponents and their abilities.Outside of the combat the game is somewhat of a choose-your-own-adventure game with each step being a new encounter of some sort. There's a decent variety of encounters with new ones added each successful playthrough. In some cases the ways to deal with these encounters can be equally as varied. And thankfully I've yet to see any encounters of the 'Rocks fall, everyone dies' kind. Every encounter can be dealt with potently even turning a bad encounter into a total gain. Even those based on chance have ways to tip chance in your favor. Again the lack of time limited choices allow content to be handled at your own pace.Overall the game is almost relaxing to play. It doesn't throw any cheap shots, but it also doesn't pull any punches. That and the well versed DM that is the mysterious dealer across from you makes it a +5 game of goodness.			"

								A great game which desserves more recognition then it gets. It is early access but what is already there is more then enought to persuade you to buy the game now, it is one of those ""good enought now and will only get better"" kinda deals.The game itself plays kinda like the board games like zombie in my pocket. You are faced with a bunch of faced down cards and you have a choice of which card to travel to. The card is then fliped over and will show you an event on your journey, it may be a skill task (govern by a pick a card to see outcome mechanic), a shop to by food or magic items, or a combat encounter to spend the magic items on.The combat encounters are special in that you are put into a 3D space with a brawler ruleset. You get with the weapons and items you have picked up from events and shops and are to fight a couple or monsters, or face a difficult maze, depending on the card.The game is rich in lore and story, with every senario covering a specific target and the story of how he or she came to be the target. Each scenario starts with the player building the deck of encounters and dangers (except for a small number of predetermine scenariobased cards) which makes this game really unique in that a dungeon is as hard as player balances it to be.Highly recommended			"

												I might be a huge fan of rogue-light games, like Hand of Fate, but I'm still surprised to see just how much I got into this one. It's such a weird blending of random generation, board game/card game elements, and brawling that it's hard to believe all that could've worked together in one game, but Hand of Fate surely showed me how it's done.The theming with all of the narration and storytelling is fanstastic and well appriciated. It's actually surprising to see just how much of that was put into the DLCs too. It invokes that D&D style of love and care in storytelling that makes lonely nights of gaming more warm and inviting. As I said: Very much appriciated.The fighting begins simple and innocent enough, but, after unlocking loads of card (An event that's quite enjoyable in of itself), you'll begin to realize just how much awareness and management you'll need to worry about as your adventures drag on; especially in Endless Mode. It's still not a hugely complex task in comparison to other brawler games, but it's usually a brief excursion that helps liven up the experiance of play. When you start to form a powerful character, it becomes all the more enjoyable watching 16+ hordes of enemies fall before you as you rake in the spoils of battle.The free DLCs are a great welcome to the game and I'm still working to try and finish off the last couple of cards involved with them, but the paid DLC that offers a multitude of new characters to play as also adds in some new questlines to experiance. The fact that the character modifiers really do change up the experiance is good enough, but I really do appriciate their lasting contibution to the events deck in the end. Variety of play is something I really appriciate on some nights when I only have a couple of hours to play and, for the price of it all, it's more than fair enough from my standpoint.The Story Mode really does ease you into the game as it begins to build upon itself, raising the states and difficulty until the final battle. You can fully customize most elements of the game during so too, which really helps when you want to fix things to your favor or work in some new cards to reap their tokens. Endless Mode starts off very simply but rapidly escalates into a really rough experiance and is great for experianced players wanting to test their skills (Works well for unlocking more cards too, in some cases). Story mode is fully replayable, which is great, and Endless Mode is my jam when I just want to dive into play. Everything I need for whatever mood I'm in.Anything else to gush about? Hmm... I don't think so. This game's an easy recommendation from me, but I will advise against it for a couple of things:1) There's a lot of RNG in the game that will work hard against you. Not all the time, but at some points. It sucks when you get screwed, but it doesn't wreck you completely; At least, most of the time.2) This game just isn't for everyone. It's easy to see that from the general game in of itself, but it's just the truth. For anyone that's open to playing a variety of games to play, Hand of Fate is a fairly safe purchase, but not for those types of people that like to stick to their narrow pool of genres. If you're one of those types of people and still want to experiance something weird and new for yourself, I'd probably recommend something else to you.Want a number rating? I'd say an 8/10; at the very least, a 7/10. It's not your GotY, but there's a lot to enjoy from this game and, if you can get it and the DLC all for under $10.00, then you'll be getting great value from it all.			"

												This is the first Steam review I have ever written, I normally wouldn't write them, but I enjoy this game so very much that I thought I would share my thoughts.This game is, hands down, one of the most compelling roguelike-rpg-combat games I have ever played. It has a very tight core gameplay loop, it scratches that collectable itch, and the combat is fun, with enough mechanics to keep it interesting. But let me speak to the one feature that really sold this game to me. The Dealer. God I hate that man. But I also love him. He narrates the game, he goads you, he encourages you, he hints at a story behind why you and him are playing the game, Every snide aside and every grudging compliment I feel like I earn, and when I defeat one of his cards I literally whoop with victory. As for the RNG (random number generator for those not familar with acronyms) aspect of the game, I never feel like it was unfair, because you can choose which cards to include in your deck. For the past 3 games I was insta killed by one particular card. Am I complaining? No, I chose to include that card specifically because I want to unlock the next card after that. I like to intentionally make the hardest deck I can, just to see if I can beat it. Because there is that element of choice, I never feel like the game is unfair.Finally, the difficulty curve. It is rather seductive. It lures you in the first couple of bosses, and then decides to smack you around a bit. I like it, I feel like it lengthens the game. The one issue I have is that I feel like it was way too easy on the outset, so I managed to get to the 10th boss with minimal losses. That could be just me, and it is taking quite a few runs to even see the boss I am currently on.That gets to my final point, and only criticism, such as it is. I need more. I am worried I will be running out of cards to find, of things to see, and I need more. Fortunately the game seems very well set up to add content to, and I for one will be getting whatever the developers put out. I hope they support this game for a very long time. I wholeheartly recommend this game to players who enjoy a good dungeon crawl, who like paying for their mistakes, and especially to those who love the feel of a board game, where you can look across the table at your opponent and think, ""Time to take this jacka-- down. ""			"

												As only a dabbler in Rogue-lite games, I was not expecting to enjoy Hand of Fate nearly as much as I did.  Now I could sit here and attempt to describe all of the gameplay elements that go into Hand of Fate, (Rogue-lite action rpg with CCG-style deck-building and progression) but that doesn't really describe what the game IS or why I enjoy it so much.  This game pulled me in, and really got me into the "" just one more run"" Rogue-lite mindset in a way most others in the genre have not.The basic premise of the game is that you construct a deck of equipment and encounter cards and use it to try and defeat each of the dealer's decks of minions.  Each deck progresses over several randomly laid out ""dungeon floors"" constructed from the encounter cards you chose, plus a few from the dealer.  The goal is to get to the bottom and defeat the deck boss, while unlocking new cards and equipment along the way.The difficulty curve in this mode is really nice (especially for a Rogue-lite), by which I mean that most action rpg veterans will find that they breeze through the first few deck challenges purely on the strength of their combat.  That, however, does not last.  As the game progresses, unlocking more cards and building your encounter and equipment decks around the specific challenges of an enemy deck becomes more and more important.  This is the part of the game that keeps hooking me back in.  I'd find myself failing a run, but super-excited to start a new one just to see what the new cards I unlocked did.  Also, the artwork for the cards is really really well done and the dealer character has some of the best voice-acting (and one-liner writing) I've heard in a game for quite a while.A few minor gripes:  The controls for the combat sections aren't quite as tight as I would like (read: as tight as in Arkham City / Asylum), but they are more than adequate by action-rpg standards.  That said, the combat can get a bit repetitive after a while, as the combat system itself doesn't have quite the depth of a full-on action rpg.  Different weapons and abilities help some, but the 15th time you draw a 6 of Scales does start to feel grind-y.Endless mode is a bit of a mixed bag: it's more of the traditional rogue-lite experience (starts off relatively easy, and just gets continuously harder until you die), but without any of the custom deck-building from Story Mode (it just throws every card you have into the mix).Final word:  If you like Rogue-lites, I highly reccomend this one, especially if you're also into CCG-driven mechanics.  If you don't like Rogue-lites at all, I'm curious why you're still reading this review, but if you got this far, this one *might* be worth giving a chance, especially since the difficulty curve starts out a bit more forgiving than most of the genre and doesn't really start ramping up until you've cleared 4 or 5 decks.  That said, it is still a Rogue-lite, which means you will occasionally have the runs that end in 4 moves because you drew the hardest 2 monsters in the deck after losing your shield and half your health to bad luck.

												Mixes cards and dungeon exploring to a result that's both satisfying and interesting. Hand of Fate challenges you to chase down 12 bosses before you can challenge the dealer himself. Each boss quest is like a dungeon adventure, where you choose from cards on a table. Whatever is picked is what you'll have to face. These range from random events, to equipment pickups, groups of enemies, travelling salesmen and lots more. For each step you take on the map, you consume one food. As the story progresses these settings may increase and various curses will make your adventures more difficult. The second part of the game is in the combat, where the game switches to a third person action game. Overcome them and you'll move on.All in all it's an enjoyable mix of two different game genres that I cannot recall to have seen before Hand of Fate did it - and it works surprisingly well. Rating: 8/10 - Play it!			"

												I'm going to start off by saying that Hand of Fate is one of the most original and entertaining games I've played in a long time. My friend got it for me for Christmas, and I can definitely say it was an excellent gift (even if it took me a while to get around to playing it). It's well worth the $20 it costs; if you find it on sale, even more so. That being said, there is a very, very big issue I had with it.If I had to rate HoF based on everything except the final boss fight, I'd easily give it a solid 4/5. It does rely quite heavily on luck, which can be frustrating at times, which is the only thing preventing it from being 5/5. However, if I were to rate the entire game as a whole, the final boss sadly drops it down to 3/5. Yes, it's that big of a sore spot for me. The first time I reached the final boss (not an easy feat, I should add, given the high degree of luck involved in dungeon and loot generation in the game), I was in very good shape, and cleared the first part of the fight without much difficulty.Then, out of nowhere, there was a cinematic Quicktime Event. A QTE that, if failed, causes instant death. Now, I'm not a fan of QTEs in general, but this one was particularly egregious because prior to the final boss, there is not a single QTE in the entire game. The player has absolutely no reason to expect one. Not only that, since the game revolves around enemies that correspond to various suits of cards, when a giant Q popped up on my screen at the start of the event, I thought it meant the boss was summoning a Queen enemy. A moment later, however, SPACE popped up, and I realized it was a QTE, but by then it was too late. Instant death. And in Hand of Fate, death means having to start the entire randomly generated dungeon over again from the beginning, losing all your collected gear and gold, and getting reverted back to starting equipment.Quite frankly, it was a dirty move on the part of the developers. It's the gameplay equivalent of a jumpscare; the fight would have been legitimately fun and challenging without the QTE, but they decided to randomly give the player a chance to die instantly, regardless of their gear or combat skill. Not only that, it actively punishes the player for not spoiling the final boss fight for themselves; reading online guides or FAQs beforehand would have given me advance warning, so I would have known to be ready for the Quicktime Event, but since I wanted to get through the game on my own, I was sucker punched.Regardless, I would still recommend the game, but I will definitely not be picking up the sequel until I have determined that it is free of 'press X to not die' moments.

												Medicore combat used pretty much for making the rest of the game feel better. It's essentially a CYOA with roguelike elements to it that expand the game more  the long you play, for the most part. Unfortunately, bad luck in this case can elongate how long it takes to even look at certain types of cards, which means if you really want to look at all the cards, you'll probably just have to grind easier difficulties to anywhere any time soon. While the CYOA part is fun, eventually it unfortunately tends to be more boring than fun as you see the same dialogue for the same choices over and over and over, and the same dialogue over and over and over and over, and it begins to feel less like an exploration than just choosing which buffs you'd like to get and hopefully getting good rolls. If the rolling was more fun or more interesting, it would be great. If the choices felt actually varied, that would be great. If the combat and items supported the rest of the game better, that'd be great. Unfortunately, none of that is true, and it becomes a mediocre roguelike where the main selling point is the uniqueness. Being able to influence your dungeon is kind of fun, but not nearly as much as it sounds unfortunately. Certain items are worthless or absolutely BoS, so instead of having a variety you usually just end up picking up stuff to make things better.All in all it was a fun experience in some part, and an absolute drudge when combat took precedence over the rest of the game. Combat's only benefit is the item choices you get to make, which means bad items make the combat absolutely boring, even when difficult. Really only recommended if you like CYOA, really.			"

Early Access Review
								Having first learned of this game through YouTube, I decided to pick it up for myself and see what all the fuss is about.It's difficult to put this into one category of games. It's essentially a roguelike adventure game, which uses cards to determine your journey and has a bit of combat that's somewhat similar to the Batman games.The cards you draw affect various things, from your equipment, to your resources, to what enemies you face. Some cards are mini-quests which have different outcomes depending on your choices. I came across a card called ""Devil's Choice"", where I was given the choice to fight one of three cards: 2 of Dust, 2 of Dust and 3 of Dust. When I chose 3 of Dust, the Devil basically removed that card and made me fight the other two combined, ""just for laughs"".You won't have many cards at first, but as you complete dungeons, defeat bosses and complete quest cards, you will receive tokens that unlock new cards. You can then choose which cards to use in your deck. This offers a good amount of player freedom in how you want to shape your experience for each run. For example, if you wish an added challenge, you can choose to play a deck that contains no armour or shield cards.The game starts of easy enough, but after the 3 first ""dungeons"" it already gets exponentially more difficult, mainly because of what I like to call Roguelike Syndrome; basically, no matter how well you do, the game can mess you up worse than any one enemy can. My first attempt at the Jack of Plagues ended when I drew two consecutive Angry Mob challenges, and rolled the worst outcomes on both while I was already low on life and resources. While I'm perfectly alright with such events, do understand that if you're not used to Roguelike Syndrome, you will swear at this game for being unfair. A lot.There are currently two game modes; story mode and endless mode. Story mode pits you against the dealer in a quest to defeat his lieutenants (who are based on the the regular deck of cards - 4 jacks, 4 queens and 4 kings, one of each for each suit) and ultimately, him. Endless mode simply allows you to play for as long as you can.The few flaws I have found so far, I don't consider to be dealbreakers, and I believe these could be ironed out by the time this gets out of early access. The combat seems a little bit too easy. A ""blind random"" deckbuilding option would have been nice as well. And of course, more content is always nice.Other than that, it looks pretty good, the voice acting of the dealer is pretty solid, and there's already a good amount of content to keep you busy. But DO play with a controller, it makes the game infinitely better to handle.Highly recommended.			"

A Rogue-like, looking for an equal!I've started to notice this game because of TheReformist, therefore huge shoutout to him! https://www.youtube.com/user/ReformistTMGo check him out. Impressive Voice, enjoyable Pace of the presented content.If you played Binding of Isaac and really liked the increasing difficulty and the randomised Worlds you can discover, but felt that there was a story shortage or the story setting wasn't yours, Hand of Fate takes you into its medieval, fantasy world.My personal experience with the huge amount of Early Access games that are out there is: They have Content and Gameplay, which more often than not is tossed into your face, ""Do or Die!"". Hand of Fate is also in Early Access, but does an amazing job at introducing the Player to its mechanics in an enjoyable way.Facing The Dealer you journey through an ever changing deck of cards, encountering traps and fortunes alike, gaining treasures and surpassing hurdles or... not. But don't falter! For each surpassed challenge your fate shuffles again and may change to your likings. For each Boss beaten the challenge increases and the world expands. Who knows what The Dealer holds for You?			"

If you have a shield you will tend to dominate the earlier part of quest, but the event cards wil keep you on your toes for sure! I would heartily recommend this to anyone who likes awesome atmosphere, interesting card effects and enviornments, juggling resorces and combat which focuses on dodging and countering.			"

												This game is awesome, still, it made me rage so much... Why ? Because even if the game looks REALLY easy in the beginning, when action phases (fights and escape traps sequences) remain ""simple"", it becomes a real nightmare at the end of the game. The camera is NEVER looking in the right direction, so sometimes you'll have to fight ennemis you cannot see... or avoid traps hidden by the awful camera. Same goes for the action phases gameplay : it's impossible to precisely move around the map or attack from a certain angle, so you'll loose heath by falling into traps a lot. In the late game, you cannot really afford to loose health in such a way.It's a HUGE frustration because this game really rocks, but I get so angry when I play it, I just wanna smash my keyboard into my screen. For f**k sake, when you create a game, when you see its flaws (cause you've got to be blind if you don't), just don't put gameplay elements that emphasize them. Or FIX IT. For the traps sequences, WHY DON'T WE HAVE A GOD DAMN ""RIGHT ON TOP OF THE CHARACTER CAMERA"" ? Why did you put a stupid inertia to the main character's movement when you simply don't have it when you fight ? WHY ?I guess I'll wait for hand of fate 2 now, I don't wanna rage anymore trying to avoid things I simply cannot see.			"

												I have to say this a strange concept for a game and one I was hesitant to try at first but I am pleased to say it was excuted well. I would be wary if you get frustrated easily as this game is VERY dependent on the old RNG. For a hybrid action title this can be frustrating. I was stuck on one of the decks for a few days without coming anywhere close to completeing it when BAM I hit a couple lucky cards and breezed past the boss battle in about 40 seconds. I do not see this necessarily as a knock on the game as I feel it was really designed as a card game of choice and chance (with some deckbuilding elements mixed in) first and an action title second. I would Atmposphere is where this game really excels and has to be my #1 reason for giving this the thumbs up. From the narrator to the combat level layout and on to the basic but very fitting card art I get drawn in every playthrough. I strongly feel this is a title best played in the one or two runs per session.I am enjoying this title and recommend it to anyone who wants to try something different. There are some RNG frustrations that would make it a tough sell to some and Mechanically the combat gets a bit repetitive.7/10			"

												Very entertaining game with a few flaws. You can read all about the great stuff in other reviews; other people have covered all the high points far better than I. The problems right now:1. Random chance of instant, nothing-you-can-do-about-it death. The Curse of Davey Jones, I'm looking at you. Nothing is more frustrating than your game ending with no way to mitigate the result.2. Gigantic ramp up in difficulty. The game starts out fairly easy and gradually gets more difficult as you progress. That's a good thing, but the last card, and the dealer, are difficult to the point of being obnoxiously ruthless. There's room for random chance in a game, but once you get to these portions, it's 95% luck and 5% skill. That's no fun.3. Some of the later battles are tedious. It's an exercise in meditation. Fighting several lava golems at once with the basic starting equipment isn't particularly difficult, but it takes a terribly long time and gets a bit stale after the first 15 minutes of the same attack, dodge, attack, dodge, attack, dodge routine.So, play on Endless Mode instead, hope you never draw The Curse of Davey Jones, and enjoy.

												I find myself moving down this dusty corridor, dodging flame traps and a spike ceiling trying to crush me.  I catch my breath for a moment, roll past some arrow traps, and grab a chest!And my reward is some cards.  And the man across the table from me makes some cryptic statements about my past, or the history of that card, or something vague and menacing.This is the sort of thing that happens in this game, and its amazing.Hand of Fate can be best described as a Deck Building Action RPG hybrid.  You are a nameless someone, who has decided to play a game of life and death against a mysterious Dealer.  Your goal is to defeat the 12 members of the Dealers Card Court.  Your weapons, tools, and even dungeons are the very cards being used in the game.I have not played for very long as I don't want to spoil the game for when I do a video playthrough of it, but suffice to say what I have played has my interest piqued.  I want to know who I am, where I came from, how I got to this place, and why this Dealer is such a snarky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Recently, the devs put out a Free content expansion, which adds another little mini story to the game.The basic gameplay is that you have a deck of cards that you have built.  Well 2 actually: Equipment and Encounters.  The dealer then spices things up by adding cards to them, cards you have no knowledge of.  He then lays out a dungeon face down on the table, made up of cards.  You then move a token around from card to card, and experience a variety of things.  One card might be an Ambush of Skeletons, another might be meeting an Elf Lass, another might be a dangerous ravine, or a trap room.In the case of combat, or trap rooms, the game switches to an Action RPG setup, using a combat system very similar to the new Batman Arkham games.  You can dodge, roll, attack, and eventually should you find the gear cast spells or special powers.  One power I had early on let me cause all my attacks to generate cash on the ground that I could pick up.The devs have said the main campaign takes about 12 hours to get through, so about an hour per court member.  There is also Endless mode, which is of course Endless.Hopefully more content updates come down the pipe as I can see myself playing this for quite a while.			"

Early Access Review
								Very interesting. As a deck-building game, it starts off somewhat bland with few cards... but that's all a part of it as you learn basic mechanics and how the game is played. As you progress, you build your deck full of new interesting encounters and gear that you can find during your adventure. The gameplay itself reminds me of the Batman games, though a little clunkier. As an Early Access game, I am not too worried about that.This has a lot of potential and I recommend it if you enjoyed the combat in the Batman Arkham series. This is scratching my 'action-rpg-loot' itch for the moment. The voice acting of the card dealer is also very well done. However, you should use a controller. The menus aren't all that well-done and the combat needs a bit of tweaking. Overall, though, I recommend it.			"

								The game feels like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, but with cards. The combo/flow combat is solid, and the scenarios each have some factor that must be overcome as much as the fights.Really glad Extra Credits let me know this was a thing. I'm very glad I purchased it.			"

												Fantastic game that becomes an addiction after you get past the first boss. The Dealer's commentary and card descriptions are great! If you like RPG's, deck building games, and fighting with sword and sheild and mace and axe and HUGE HAMMER, then by all means, play this game if you dare chance the hand of fate. "

A Rogue-like, looking for an equal!I've started to notice this game because of TheReformist, therefore huge shoutout to him! https://www.youtube.com/user/ReformistTMGo check him out. Impressive Voice, enjoyable Pace of the presented content.If you played Binding of Isaac and really liked the increasing difficulty and the randomised Worlds you can discover, but felt that there was a story shortage or the story setting wasn't yours, Hand of Fate takes you into its medieval, fantasy world.My personal experience with the huge amount of Early Access games that are out there is: They have Content and Gameplay, which more often than not is tossed into your face, ""Do or Die!"". Hand of Fate is also in Early Access, but does an amazing job at introducing the Player to its mechanics in an enjoyable way.Facing The Dealer you journey through an ever changing deck of cards, encountering traps and fortunes alike, gaining treasures and surpassing hurdles or... not. But don't falter! For each surpassed challenge your fate shuffles again and may change to your likings. For each Boss beaten the challenge increases and the world expands. Who knows what The Dealer holds for You?			"

Product received for free
												I'm going to start off by saying that Hand of Fate is one of the most original and entertaining games I've played in a long time. My friend got it for me for Christmas, and I can definitely say it was an excellent gift (even if it took me a while to get around to playing it). It's well worth the $20 it costs; if you find it on sale, even more so. That being said, there is a very, very big issue I had with it.If I had to rate HoF based on everything except the final boss fight, I'd easily give it a solid 4/5. It does rely quite heavily on luck, which can be frustrating at times, which is the only thing preventing it from being 5/5. However, if I were to rate the entire game as a whole, the final boss sadly drops it down to 3/5. Yes, it's that big of a sore spot for me. The first time I reached the final boss (not an easy feat, I should add, given the high degree of luck involved in dungeon and loot generation in the game), I was in very good shape, and cleared the first part of the fight without much difficulty.Then, out of nowhere, there was a cinematic Quicktime Event. A QTE that, if failed, causes instant death. Now, I'm not a fan of QTEs in general, but this one was particularly egregious because prior to the final boss, there is not a single QTE in the entire game. The player has absolutely no reason to expect one. Not only that, since the game revolves around enemies that correspond to various suits of cards, when a giant Q popped up on my screen at the start of the event, I thought it meant the boss was summoning a Queen enemy. A moment later, however, SPACE popped up, and I realized it was a QTE, but by then it was too late. Instant death. And in Hand of Fate, death means having to start the entire randomly generated dungeon over again from the beginning, losing all your collected gear and gold, and getting reverted back to starting equipment.Quite frankly, it was a dirty move on the part of the developers. It's the gameplay equivalent of a jumpscare; the fight would have been legitimately fun and challenging without the QTE, but they decided to randomly give the player a chance to die instantly, regardless of their gear or combat skill. Not only that, it actively punishes the player for not spoiling the final boss fight for themselves; reading online guides or FAQs beforehand would have given me advance warning, so I would have known to be ready for the Quicktime Event, but since I wanted to get through the game on my own, I was sucker punched.Regardless, I would still recommend the game, but I will definitely not be picking up the sequel until I have determined that it is free of 'press X to not die' moments.

												Only half an hour in and already I love it. The DM is excellently voice acted and every game feels unique. The combat can vary depending on your equipment. If you have a shield you will tend to dominate the earlier part of quest, but the event cards wil keep you on your toes for sure! I would heartily recommend this to anyone who likes awesome atmosphere, interesting card effects and enviornments, juggling resorces and combat which focuses on dodging and countering.			"

												This game is awesome, still, it made me rage so much... Why ? Because even if the game looks REALLY easy in the beginning, when action phases (fights and escape traps sequences) remain ""simple"", it becomes a real nightmare at the end of the game. The camera is NEVER looking in the right direction, so sometimes you'll have to fight ennemis you cannot see... or avoid traps hidden by the awful camera. Same goes for the action phases gameplay : it's impossible to precisely move around the map or attack from a certain angle, so you'll loose heath by falling into traps a lot. In the late game, you cannot really afford to loose health in such a way.It's a HUGE frustration because this game really rocks, but I get so angry when I play it, I just wanna smash my keyboard into my screen. For f**k sake, when you create a game, when you see its flaws (cause you've got to be blind if you don't), just don't put gameplay elements that emphasize them. Or FIX IT. For the traps sequences, WHY DON'T WE HAVE A GOD DAMN ""RIGHT ON TOP OF THE CHARACTER CAMERA"" ? Why did you put a stupid inertia to the main character's movement when you simply don't have it when you fight ? WHY ?I guess I'll wait for hand of fate 2 now, I don't wanna rage anymore trying to avoid things I simply cannot see.			"

												Starting Hand of Fate, I had no idea what was in store for me. The concept of being a trading card slash action game sounded quite interesting, but I just couldn’t imagine where or how the two would meet.Thankfully, when you initially sit down at the table where your fate is decided, all questions go out the window as soon as the deckmaster speaks. The dealer/deckmaster, voiced by Anthony Skordi, immediately pulls you into the fantasy that is Hand of Fate with his fantastic voice acting, and makes it so you can’t help but linger on his every word spoken.The ConceptThe idea for Hand of Fate is quite unique and reminiscent of old pen and paper games such as Dungeons & Dragons. The deckmaster is the one who narrates the story and you are the one who plays through it.The stories played out are controlled via cards that trigger certain events which provide you with multiple choices of how you’d like to proceed. To initially activate a card, you need to move your golden gamepiece on top of it.Your gameboard is made up of face down cards that have been positioned in a way to resemble a dungeon. Cards are placed side by side or above and below each other. Your gamepiece jumps from card to card, each time using up one food.Food is the currency that controls how far you can move, gold allows you to purchase new equipment, spells and more, and health is there for enemies to try and deplete.To begin with, the deckmaster takes you by the hand and introduces you to events, multiple choice outcomes, equipping items, combat and everything else needed to know when getting started.EventsWhen landing on an event card, you might end up walking away with some new gear, extra food or fighting some monsters. Some cards will take you through a little bit of story such as seeing a man being carried away by cultists into the forest. This particular event will give you the choice of leaving them alone or interrupting their ritual.Other times you might come across a maiden who can give you a bit of extra gold, food or health. Alternate encounters can see you parting with half of your food only to avoid going back one space. However, when each movement costs one food, you’ll have to weigh the options to see if it’s worth your while.Encounters can also come in the form of a travelling salesman, mage or other such spruiker. Here you can spend all of that hard-earned gold on new weapons, armour, spells and more. You can also stock up on food to help you move those extra few spaces.If there are particular events you don’t want to encounter, customise your deck before commencing a game so you only come across the encounters you want to.CombatEncountering enemies in Hand of Fate is actually quite fun albeit, a little easy. When the deckmaster deals out some monster cards for you to face, the game changes from being played on a tabletop to a third-person hack and slash style.On PC, the usual ‘WASD’ controls your movement while clicking is used to attack and stun. By pressing ‘space-bar’ you can perform a roll to escape enemy attacks.Depending on your characters equipment, other abilities become available such as, when you’re equipped with a shield, the ‘Q’ key is used to counter enemy attacks. The countering mechanic is similar to that seen in the Batman Arkham games. Green signals will appear above enemies’ heads which let you know the attack can be countered. Red signals indicate un-counterable attacks.Combat is actually really smooth and effortless, which personally I think is a bit of a downfall. It doesn’t take long to understand your enemies’ attack patterns and dodge/counter your way to victory. Having said that, boss fights can become quite troublesome as they each have differing mechanics. I.e. Queen of Dust is accompanied by a huge, immobile crossbow that fires at you every couple of seconds, whereas the King of Scales is accompanied by lizardmen who cannot be killed whilst the King is still alive.These accompaniments and extra abilities add a nice change of pace to combat. Boss fights become more of a challenge whilst regular encounters, in my opinion, act more as a way of honing your reaction times when countering, attacking and dodging.Along with extra abilities, bosses also bring curses. Take, for example, playing through the Jack of Plague stage. Doing so lands you with a curse called “Twice the Fail”. This curse makes it so when you roll to either fail or succeed a multiple choice option, every fail you get also loses you five gold. Every huge fail loses you ten gold. Curses make things that much more interesting.Earning New CardsThere are heaps of ways to earn new cards. Some cards become unlocked by succeeding in a certain event, thus carrying on the mini-story found in said event.Alternatively you can earn new cards by defeating bosses or winning certain battles. The cards all come in handy as you progress and can be put into your customised deck to give you the upper hand in your next game.Aesthetic CharmI’m finding myself expecting more and more from indie developers and their games. It was to my surprise to find out Defiant Development are based in Brisbane, Australia. So for me, that’s as indie as they come! And to have done such a wonderful job with the graphics and animations seen in Hand of Fate makes me very proud. The card illustrations utilise a satisfying woodcut artstyle which draws you further into the fantasy of it all.Musically it’s nothing spectacular but the voice acting of the deckmaster by Anthony Skordi is simply incredible. He’s responsible for voices in other games such as The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, but I really feel that his work in Hand of Fate will go down in gaming history as one of the most engaging.The script and story writing by Defiant Development really adds to the whole experience and is literally the icing on the cake. I mean, I like cake, but when there’s icing as well, somebody stop me!Final ThoughtsHand of Fate brings the trading card and action genres together so seamlessly that you’ll be wondering why it hasn’t been done before. Each stage is longer and more exciting than the last, and gaining new cards after each game is always something to be looking forward to.There are a few things that bring the overall awesomeness down, such as: a lack of character customisation (everyone likes to make their player the way they want to, right?), relatively easy battles which often don’t require you to even think about touching your spells, and the general shortness of the Story mode, clocking in at around ten hours.Thankfully to fill in the gap between the Story mode and your next purchase, there is an Endless mode. Take your cards for a spin and see how far you can get. Hopefully if you’re good enough, you’ll make a decent appearance on the leaderboards!Ultimately I can’t recommend Hand of Fate enough to lovers of trading card games who also thoroughly enjoy smashing through monsters. If you ever tried your hand at the pen and paper version of Dungeons & Dragons and liked it, chances are you’ll find a satisfying experience playing through Hand of Fate.			"

												""Hand of Fate"" could have been a total mess, a hybrid of a collectible card, board, choice, hack & slash, rouge-like and various other game elements, with an ""opponent"" who is sitting opposite of a table to you and just insults you most of the time.But somehow, it isn't a mess, but all it's aspects are put together in such a smart way, that it makes for an interesting, engaging, fun and awesome game to play.At the core of the game is a ""deck of cards"", packed with various encounters, events, vendors, monsters and equipment. Here a big part of it already starts, because as you progress through the game, you mostly become responsible for which cards are in the deck and you form your own adventure. Though, at the same time, the role of your ""opponent"", the dealer, becomes obvious soon, when he includes some cards himself into the deck and deals the cards to you, taunting you, looking down on you when you fail and showing his spite on your success.This theme and the dynamic presented by the only one who actually gets some character, which is the dealer, already creates an intriguing setup.Then, when the cards are dealt, you have to continue over a kind of ""board"" made of the encounters, which are usually revealed as you step on each card. Sometimes something mandatory happens, but most of the time a choice will follow, how you want to deal with the encounter and as you progress through the game, you will learn about the consequences of those decisions. And sometimes, through the encounters, you will have to play in a completely different setting, where a lot of the actual action and fighting happens, which requires your skill to overcome those chellenges, though sometimes it feels somewhat unprecise.And like that you progress through the game, board by board, gaining new cards, events, equipment, but also new monsters and other chellenges.And so the weird mix turns into this game, which you can influence in a lot of ways, the way you want to play, with which cards and how to act upon encounters, spiced with some chance and skill, delivered through an awesome theme, underlined with some story, which just makes it awesome.

												I'm really enjoying this game. It reminds me of The Yawhg in that it gives you a set of choices in text format but you don't know which order they will come. I like that you can edit your decks because it gives the player some freedom to play how they want. I like playing the story driven cards but some might like the combat more. Also getting to alter your weapons deck is great because everyones fighting style will be different. I prefer Maces which do less damage but are faster while some will like the swords with more damage but slower attacks. The updates coming out are improving the gameplay and the developers are listening to the communitys feedback. I would totally recommend trying this game out.			"

												Ok so this game is really clever. The storytelling makes it. Sharp writing with an incredible flow that you could only get from an interactive experience. I love the way the stories play out across cards that you find, and that completing one card encounter, gives you the next part of the story in a card that you may draw next time you play. The dealer is wonderfully voice acted – something that is sorely missed when it comes to your average indie title. The only negative is that the real time combat is a bit clunky. It obviously draws from the Arkham series’ “Free Flow” mechanic, but is not executed with the same finesse. However, the combat does have some real weight, and seeing your gear materialise from their cards when the battle starts is ultra cool. This is a minor gripe, and something that will no doubt be addressed in Defiant’s future titles. Seriously – Hand of Fate is ridiculously good, and you should play it.Also it’s totally heart-warming to see such a great piece of entertainment come out of my home town. Well done!			"

Early Access Review
								Very interesting. As a deck-building game, it starts off somewhat bland with few cards... but that's all a part of it as you learn basic mechanics and how the game is played. As you progress, you build your deck full of new interesting encounters and gear that you can find during your adventure. The gameplay itself reminds me of the Batman games, though a little clunkier. As an Early Access game, I am not too worried about that.This has a lot of potential and I recommend it if you enjoyed the combat in the Batman Arkham series. This is scratching my 'action-rpg-loot' itch for the moment. The voice acting of the card dealer is also very well done. However, you should use a controller. The menus aren't all that well-done and the combat needs a bit of tweaking. Overall, though, I recommend it.			"

Introduction:Hand of Fate is a mix between a tabletop card game and an action/RPG video game, with some added tarot, fantasy and roguelike inspiration thrown in.  Featuring hundreds of items, armor, weapons, artifacts, curses, blessings, encounters and quests, every single playthrough is unique.  On top of that, the deck-building mechanic adds even more variety as you customize your deck to suit your needs and playstyle.  All of this across two modes of gameplay.  Whew, someone deal the cards already!TLDR Highlights:++ Playthrough Randomness++ Quest Cards++ Deckbuilding System++ Voice Acting+ Action Combat+ Visuals/Graphics- Frustrating Chance and Luck of the Draw- Single Player Only= Truly an amazing game!  I wish I had thought of it.  Highly recommended!Review:PROS -- At the top of my list is the randomness of each playthrough.  Sure, you'll see the same cards a lot, but no two hands will ever be the same.  There are so many factors and variables at work that each time you play will be a different experience.  This is huge for me, because it's what will keep me coming back for more.One of the most fun features I've found in Hand of Fate are the quest cards.  These often have interesting situations, stories and adventures, that you get to see unfold right then or spread across several games if the quest has multiple parts.  Fun stuff and, again, keeps me coming back for more!Which brings me to the deckbuilding system.  By completing quest cards, defeating bosses, and other such things, you'll recieve tokens (which work similar to booster packs in a TCG) giving you more cards to add to your deck.  You can let the game recommend and build your deck for you, or you can hand select individual cards to build your own deck.  Granted, this system may seem pretty standard, but there was something about winning tokens and unlocking new cards that consistently gets me excited throughout the game.  Not to mention that it adds variety to my deck, which -- you guessed it! -- keeps me coming back for more.When it comes to voice acting, the dealer character is the only one that has any dialogue.  That being said, I don't think they could have found a better voice actor for the job.  It's done extremely well, and fits perfectly with the theme.  Not only that, but the script is excellent, because his idle chat and card/situation specific dialogue never seems to get old and has a genuine feel to it.  Mixing action RPG (Batman/Shadow of Mordor-esque) combat might have been a risking move on the developers part, but it was executed very well.  Combat starts out ridiculously easy as it teaches game mechanics, but as your deck gets stronger the enemies do too, thus making the fights more challenging.  A lot of reviewers say it's too easy all the way through, but I guarantee they died in combat plenty of times, and if they didn't then they didn't play very far into the game.  I will agree that combat might not be very complex, but it's fun and satisfying, and just challenging enough to mesh well with card game without drowning it out.  The last ""pro"" I have to add is that the visuals and graphics, even the animations, are really quite good.  It's all very pleasing to look at, and I was particularly impressed with the combat scenery.  The card artwork was well done too, and the theme fit perfectly.CONS --  Not much to add here, but like any card game, sometimes it comes down to the luck of the draw, which I can attest does not always go your way.  And it can be frustrating at times, especially later in the game when a single misstep can be very dangerous and potentially cost you the game.  Some people find this intolerable, but I don't really mind it that much.  It's a card game, after all, and chance is part of the territory.  Besides, there are blessing cards to help tip things it your favor (curse cards to make it worse too, so watch out).  And when you have to pick a card to determine success or failure, it's made so that you can try to follow movement of the card you want during the shuffle.  Still, it can be quite punishing at times, which turns some people off.Finally, I'm disappointed that there's no multiplayer.  Not entirely sure how it would work in this game, but I'd love to play a card game like this with friends!OVERALL --  There's so much to like about Hand of Fate, and very little to complain about. Without a doubt, this is one of the best games in my steam library.  I can't believe I never even heard of it until recently, but I'm very glad this game entered my crosshairs, because it's a true gem.  I most certainly recommend!			"

												Ok so this game is really clever. The storytelling makes it. Sharp writing with an incredible flow that you could only get from an interactive experience. I love the way the stories play out across cards that you find, and that completing one card encounter, gives you the next part of the story in a card that you may draw next time you play. The dealer is wonderfully voice acted – something that is sorely missed when it comes to your average indie title. The only negative is that the real time combat is a bit clunky. It obviously draws from the Arkham series’ “Free Flow” mechanic, but is not executed with the same finesse. However, the combat does have some real weight, and seeing your gear materialise from their cards when the battle starts is ultra cool. This is a minor gripe, and something that will no doubt be addressed in Defiant’s future titles. Seriously – Hand of Fate is ridiculously good, and you should play it.Also it’s totally heart-warming to see such a great piece of entertainment come out of my home town. Well done!			"

												It's like they took elements from Card Hunter, Batman, Bastion, FTL, and Ziggurat, mixed it up in a blender, and ended up with something far more enchanting and wonderful than you would ever expect. It starts off pretty easy but the difficulty ramps up considerably as you unlock new cards.  It's one of those ""Just one more round"" games  I always seem to end up playing until 3AM without realizing it. There's also an endless mode for infinite replayability. If you're on the fence about this one, check out the Total Biscuit video for a really great synopsis of what makes this one so special. I can't wait to see what kind of stuff this developer has in store for the future.			"

												The First time I saw this game in my queue; I watched the video and said no thanks.  Few months later I am looking for a game to play while searching Google for ARPG style games and this game was on the list.  Went back and re-looked at the game a second time.  The reviews are good, with what I would say is a 90% rating based on the number of positive to negative reviews.  Sometimes my gut is wrong, after reading recent reviews trolling the discussion I decided for the 30$ CAD it might be worth a look see.There is a lot of goodness going on in this game; it pits you as the player against a dungeon master like character.  There is a randomness to the game that is fresh as you use decks of cards to determine how the game progresses.  This is an interesting concept, but there is a twist even through you can control the encounter deck, don’t expect the dealer to play fair especially as the game progresses.  The cards are dealt you move your table top piece unto the next encounter card, it plays out like a choose your own adventure novel, where you can encounter helpful goblins, or find yourself at the mercy of angry mobs.  There is also an arena type encounter where you fight in almost an arcade style fighting, cards determine how many mobs and of what type.  All leading to a Boss card at the end, the pace in the arcade game is pretty quick, but manageable even for old coots like myself.IF anything, the game suffers a bit from a lack of a good tutorial, there is a small game to begin your series, but it lacks instructions, while it is not hard, it would be nice to understand the mechanics a bit more before you are thrown into the fray.  The arcade sequence is a bit twitch as you have to use wasd as movement, along with Q and the 1 and 2 buttons, as well as the spacebar.  I am more comfortable now, but there can be a lot going on when you are being attacked by a large group when you are trying to figure out the combat mechanics.  There is no game save feature, you play, leave and resume.  Not sure if you can start over even if you wanted too. It also offers no player avatar customization, so you can’t choose what your avatar looks like, pity I think that is important sometimes to create that affinity between the player and the game.  Overall 7.5/10, this is a good solid fun casual game that is unique to play.  It offers up a never ending play value as you never know what the cards will have in store for you.  I think a few tweaks and this game easily could be 10.  Buy it and support them in the Sequel HOF2. "

												This game is one of those rare gems that exceeds expectations. The game combines and rpg with a card game quite well, the gameplay switches between going through a board made of cards into live action combat and back again. It is quite clear the developers put a lot of work into making this game. The dealer and your antagonist makes the game feel quite interactive as he narrarates your story. He also has fun lines of dialogue that just add life to the game. The combat is very simple to master but allows you plenty of room to improve. The replayability of the game is probably its strength as every single game is different and allows for plenty of room for exploration with the deck building aspect of the game to change up every single playthrough.I look forward to seeing what else is done with this game, it is well worth the 25$ it costs.

Early Access Review
								I played this game for about an hour, even though it is in beta early access, its reminiscence of fable in looks, and plays like a card game while featuring dungeon crawling and fights that just top the exceptional uniqueness of this game. It also can be challenging with the random draw of cards because you dont know what monsters or mazes or traps you will have to face, you could say the game has a roguelikness to it because if you die you die. But you keep the cards you unlock and can build preset decks, and decide what you want to take with you into your next game such as armor, weapons, abilities, etc. Take in mind though that this game is in beta, and it needs a little more fine tuning in the fluidity of fighting and character movement but i beliieve that will be taken care of in one of the many updates being worked on in the future. This game is amazing and has great potential i would recommend this game to all my friends or any other gamer.			"

												An excellent sit-back-and-chill game. Fully controller supported. A little action, a lotta optioning. What makes this game though is the narrator, who basically serves as your opponent. His varied commentary and hints at the larger picture do an excellent job of keeping you going.If you're looking for something that's more about seeing what comes next and less about jamming X to win (though there's a bit of that, need some action to keep you invested), this is definitely worth checking out.

								This was a surprisingly fun random pick up. I would describe it as a Rogue-like mixed with a card game mixed with Gauntlet. You play against a narrating wizard who draws random card challenges as you progress through a dungeon and taunts you. It's a simple and fun mechanic and you can sit down to play a round in 15-30 minutes. As you encounter certain cards you get tokens to unlock new cards to put in your deck. All in all very nice.			"

Early Access Review
								Brilliant Concept!Interesting combination of:-Choose your own adventure (Like those books) :: Every card in your encounter deck is like single page in that kind of book. You build your own deck from the cards you have unlocked.-Action Adventure Game (god of war) :: While the combat is not impressive looking and visceral as those games tend to be, the combat has strategic and dynamic elements to keep you on your toes.-Rogue Like :: Rogue likes have always been about exploration and resource management. This game offers that in spades.When I played this for first few runs, I thought that ""Soon I've seen all the encounters and items so it will lose it's charm"" but I discovered that some of the encounter cards are not set in stone. They have multiple ""forms"". For example encounter called ""Rock Fall"" had very different conclusion.Also when player is given ""random"" positive or negative conclusion to encounter the player draws from Four different cards.Cards can be any combination of Fail, Greater Fail, Success, Greater Success.The fact that player is physically show the shuffle of these cards gives him opportunity to follow how the cards move and can eliminate possibilities.Also every encounter with ""red spot"" on it, is part of a quest of sorts. When dealt with correctly will unlock the next part of the quest available for your encounter deck. This is very neat way of not making the game all about getting to the boss but the path to the boss is also important.So that this review would not be complete hype lets bring up few issues:-Combat is every now and then very easy. When there are 1-4 opponents you can overwhelm the enemy quickly because your ""auto targeting"" attacks send you flying across the map. You feel like juggernaut from Dota 2-Block / Counter animations are too slow compared to your normal ones. You feel like everyone in the game stops for your to do your animation.-Enemies NEVER attack at same time. There is always only single enemy swinging a sword + one ranged enemy ready to fire.-Block / Counter ""quick-time"" prompts show for too long. I feel like being babied into the game. I wish there was some difficulty settings about this.-Blood. Game really needs blood right now the swings rarely give me that satisfaction. I barely get any feedback from hitting the enemy. Its even harder to discern how much damage I've done or have I actually killed one of my enemies without any blood splatters.As you can see Most gripes I have are in the combat of the game. Thankfully the combat still feels fun but could be more.And HEY! It's not all about the combat anyway. :3			"

												Hand of Fate is really something out of the ordinary;Designed as a card collecting/dungeon brawler game, it tries a fresh, new approach to both genres.+-Interesting gameplayGreat voice actingAmazing artworkVery forgiving, yet challengingOne-button combatsluggish animations in combatDescription to how the game works; (thought I'd put it a bit after the pro and cons, as it's a bit mundane to read.)At the start of each new dungeon, you'll get to choose, which cards are in your own ""equipment"" deck and which cards you want to add to the dealer's deck. So you decide whether you want this extra shield or ring, or rather add an extra sword into the deck. The same thing is possible with your dealer's deck, as it's your call to make your game easier and miss out on those card tokens, which you need for new cards, equipment as well as encounters, or choose the cards, which are yet to be beaten and try your best on the way.The dealer lays out a dungeon with the chosen cards, in which you navigate around with your little figurine, kinda like a board game. From time to time you'll encounter a monster or a trap, from where the game will switch into a Arkam City-style 3rd person combat system, which is debateably the weakest part of the game, in which you can move around a small area, dodge, attack and counter attacks.I really hope you found this review helpful in aiding your decision towards buying this game.If you have thoughts on improving this review, please contact me!

Early Access Review
								First Impressions:Combining an ARPG with the deck-building genre is both gutsy and interesting.  I had a hard time wrapping my head around what such a game would be like until I actually sat down with it and gave it a spin. The encounter deck, combined with the narrator's own stock, will make up the obstacles you'll have to overcome.  You'll gain equipment, food, and other goodies by successfully completing these encounters, allowing you to improve your character.  In between games however, your character starts over with just your basic equipment (though the cards you unlock can be seeded into your decks so that you can discover them next game).  The combat portions put you into an arena where you'll be actively trying to be the last one standing.  The flow of combat and the combat mechanics reminded me a bit of ""Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor"", albeit an extremely simplistic version. As a fan of deck-builders, ""Hand of Fate"" is an easy recommend.

								Brilliant Concept!Interesting combination of:-Choose your own adventure (Like those books) :: Every card in your encounter deck is like single page in that kind of book. You build your own deck from the cards you have unlocked.-Action Adventure Game (god of war) :: While the combat is not impressive looking and visceral as those games tend to be, the combat has strategic and dynamic elements to keep you on your toes.-Rogue Like :: Rogue likes have always been about exploration and resource management. This game offers that in spades.When I played this for first few runs, I thought that ""Soon I've seen all the encounters and items so it will lose it's charm"" but I discovered that some of the encounter cards are not set in stone. They have multiple ""forms"". For example encounter called ""Rock Fall"" had very different conclusion.Also when player is given ""random"" positive or negative conclusion to encounter the player draws from Four different cards.Cards can be any combination of Fail, Greater Fail, Success, Greater Success.The fact that player is physically show the shuffle of these cards gives him opportunity to follow how the cards move and can eliminate possibilities.Also every encounter with ""red spot"" on it, is part of a quest of sorts. When dealt with correctly will unlock the next part of the quest available for your encounter deck. This is very neat way of not making the game all about getting to the boss but the path to the boss is also important.So that this review would not be complete hype lets bring up few issues:-Combat is every now and then very easy. When there are 1-4 opponents you can overwhelm the enemy quickly because your ""auto targeting"" attacks send you flying across the map. You feel like juggernaut from Dota 2-Block / Counter animations are too slow compared to your normal ones. You feel like everyone in the game stops for your to do your animation.-Enemies NEVER attack at same time. There is always only single enemy swinging a sword + one ranged enemy ready to fire.-Block / Counter ""quick-time"" prompts show for too long. I feel like being babied into the game. I wish there was some difficulty settings about this.-Blood. Game really needs blood right now the swings rarely give me that satisfaction. I barely get any feedback from hitting the enemy. Its even harder to discern how much damage I've done or have I actually killed one of my enemies without any blood splatters.As you can see Most gripes I have are in the combat of the game. Thankfully the combat still feels fun but could be more.And HEY! It's not all about the combat anyway. :3			"

												One of the best games I have played in a long time.  Hell, one of the best games I've ever played.  I was instantly hooked and knew I had to play it after only watching a couple minutes of someone else.  It is so rare to have a game be so punishing yet so rewarding and fun at the same time.  Laughing all the while filled with rage at how you got screwed over is a beautiful thing.  It makes every step towards victory all the more sweet!			"

Early Access Review
								I played this game for about an hour, even though it is in beta early access, its reminiscence of fable in looks, and plays like a card game while featuring dungeon crawling and fights that just top the exceptional uniqueness of this game. It also can be challenging with the random draw of cards because you dont know what monsters or mazes or traps you will have to face, you could say the game has a roguelikness to it because if you die you die. But you keep the cards you unlock and can build preset decks, and decide what you want to take with you into your next game such as armor, weapons, abilities, etc. Take in mind though that this game is in beta, and it needs a little more fine tuning in the fluidity of fighting and character movement but i beliieve that will be taken care of in one of the many updates being worked on in the future. This game is amazing and has great potential i would recommend this game to all my friends or any other gamer.			"

												Pretty damn awesome, unique and downright cozy to play. The only somewhat major downside is a lack of proper user interface, or rather a lack of polish in said derpardment. If they took notes regarding click and feedback from a game such as Hearthstone, or indie related, 2dboy's World of Goo, this game would immedietly be a 10'er for an indie game.			"

								This was a surprisingly fun random pick up. I would describe it as a Rogue-like mixed with a card game mixed with Gauntlet. You play against a narrating wizard who draws random card challenges as you progress through a dungeon and taunts you. It's a simple and fun mechanic and you can sit down to play a round in 15-30 minutes. As you encounter certain cards you get tokens to unlock new cards to put in your deck. All in all very nice.			"

There's nothing wrong with those genres but I just haven't found any that work for me. Until HoF. It's storytelling and narration instantly drags you in and you will always be faced with surprises and challenges that do not get old. Every goal you successfully achieve feels amazing.Can't recommend this enough.			"

												Hand of Fate is really something out of the ordinary;Designed as a card collecting/dungeon brawler game, it tries a fresh, new approach to both genres.+-Interesting gameplayGreat voice actingAmazing artworkVery forgiving, yet challengingOne-button combatsluggish animations in combatDescription to how the game works; (thought I'd put it a bit after the pro and cons, as it's a bit mundane to read.)At the start of each new dungeon, you'll get to choose, which cards are in your own ""equipment"" deck and which cards you want to add to the dealer's deck. So you decide whether you want this extra shield or ring, or rather add an extra sword into the deck. The same thing is possible with your dealer's deck, as it's your call to make your game easier and miss out on those card tokens, which you need for new cards, equipment as well as encounters, or choose the cards, which are yet to be beaten and try your best on the way.The dealer lays out a dungeon with the chosen cards, in which you navigate around with your little figurine, kinda like a board game. From time to time you'll encounter a monster or a trap, from where the game will switch into a Arkam City-style 3rd person combat system, which is debateably the weakest part of the game, in which you can move around a small area, dodge, attack and counter attacks.I really hope you found this review helpful in aiding your decision towards buying this game.If you have thoughts on improving this review, please contact me!

												This is a really, really great game. I am so happy I found it.First of all, the dialogue is just outstanding. Not only is it well written and well spoken, it also makes the game very easy to understand. Unlike most other cards games, you don't need to learn all cards by hand, as all of these are explained in detail whenever you draw them.Furthermore, I am deeply a fan of the rogue-like aspect, which I never thought a card game could have. The gameplay is very original; there is no other game even close to this. Everytime you draw a card, you either gain resources, equipment, or you will enter a combat. I am still astonished at how one can combine so many different gaming aspects, whilst yet creating a wonderful game.With no doubt, from the old RTS games I've played to the FPS games that have been dominating the planet, this is one of the best single-player games ever made.

Early Access Review
								First Impressions:Combining an ARPG with the deck-building genre is both gutsy and interesting.  I had a hard time wrapping my head around what such a game would be like until I actually sat down with it and gave it a spin. The encounter deck, combined with the narrator's own stock, will make up the obstacles you'll have to overcome.  You'll gain equipment, food, and other goodies by successfully completing these encounters, allowing you to improve your character.  In between games however, your character starts over with just your basic equipment (though the cards you unlock can be seeded into your decks so that you can discover them next game).  The combat portions put you into an arena where you'll be actively trying to be the last one standing.  The flow of combat and the combat mechanics reminded me a bit of ""Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor"", albeit an extremely simplistic version. As a fan of deck-builders, ""Hand of Fate"" is an easy recommend.

								Really enjoy it. Lost of fun. I do feel that the combat needs a little balancing, however, since it's early access and they have stated that balancing and polishing is one of the things they are working on, I'm confidant that it will be better once fully released.  Lots of replayability in this one. Highly recomended.			"

												Let me preface this, I haven't finished the game yet but I'm halfway through the story mode. This game is amazing. Whilst the combat isn't perfect, and only a part of the over all game, it tells a great story, is engaging and the randomness of the cards and the encounters is fantastic. I've had a few bad deals, where I was just obliterated with bad luck but then you get some hard fought wins against the monsters and a few lucky cards and it can turn it all around. 9.8/10 at least. Hand of Fate needs more traction, its definitely one of the best games I've bought in a long time.			"

												Stop reading reviews and just buy this game! It's absolutely worth the full price, and being on sale makes it a no-brainer!This is an amazing game to keep you busy between larger games, or just as something to play to unwind before bed. There's not a ton of over-arching story, which makes it ideal for dipping into for a few minutes at a time, even if you let weeks pass between play sessions.The general mechanic is that you've died, and are playing a card game against death. Death deals a set of cards that create a dungeon for your character to play through. Each card is a different room or event for you to play through, with everything from gambling events to stores to story-driven events to combat. Each dungeon you play through unlocks new cards -- both equipment for your adventurer as well as rooms and events to play through.  The next time Death deals a dungeon, it will be slightly longer than the last one you played through. One of the best mechanics is that when you hit a ""combat"" room, you actually ""dive into"" the card and control your adventurer as he fights the minions from the card. The combat mechanics are simple, but surprisingly fun. The minions have enough variation in attacks and style that combat never becomes dull, even though you have to fight several mobs per dungeon. The devs are also great people. They've added a ton of new contenet since the games release, and as you play through you'll notice their little DLC expansions peppered through -- you always have the option to dive into DLC from the main game. I hope they keep releasing these expansions!So all in all, this game is a no-brainer. It isn't likely to be one that you sit down an play through entirely without breaks, but it makes a perfect distraction between larger games or just for a short session at night. Add it to your collection now!			"

												This game is very interesting, it would be the best word to describe it with.Hand of fate uses cards to basically tell a story of what happened in an adventure. With a lot of cards representing equipment, encounters and fights. It's usually up to the player to fill in the blanks in the story.Your only real contact is the Dealer. A mysterious man, sitting in a locale controlling the ''game'', which are shown through the cards. He is the person that sets it all in motion. Yet, you do not know what purpose he fulfills otherwise.The game is for the most time in the adventure on the cards. The encounter cards are laid out in a pattern, sometimes a linear path, other times a maze-like construction. Your goal is to move from your start point, to the exit, which remains hidden. Important to know, is that every move uses food. if you run out of food, you start losing health. As per usual in most games, no health = death.Some encounters require a luck-based desicion, this is represented by four different cards. in order: Huge succes, Succes, Failure and Huge failure. 4 cards are shown, with the possible outcomes for you to choose. the cards are flipped, shuffeled, and then it's up to you to choose the adventurers fate in the encounter. It's important to know that succeeding the challenge, does not always progress the encounter, nor does failure always have a bad outcome.Sometimes, an encounter happens to be a fight. You are then taken to a scene, which has a lot of variation in both size and looks. The game then turns in a 3rd person brawler. you must beat all enemies to continue, or die trying.The story of your character is vague at best, and it is up to you, as the player, to find out who he is. And most importantly, what happened to him as to how he got there. Do not think that the Dealer is there to help you, as he will remind you a lot of times.I personally like the setting a lot, it's simple, yet complicated, and shrouded in mystery. The Dealer as a character is awesome, and basically creates the atmosphere of the game on his own, commenting on your choices, your succeses, and failures.If a point of negativity is to be made, I would have liked to see some character customisation. Not that the game requires it, but it would have been nice. Also, the Dealer runs out of lines quickly, and sometimes his conversations are pretty long. Still, the story that he conveys through said dialogue is very nice.Overall, i had a great experience with the game as a whole. the DLC that i got, added a whole lot of semi-adventures to go through. I do not value scores, since a game should be your experience. A game that people generally dislike, may be the game you love the most.If a score is to be put up:8.5/10. "

												This is a very interesting game. I'm not planning on writing a full review but here are some of my thoughts:First of all, the game is VERY buggy. It will take a lot of updates and patches to fix all the bugs but I'm sure Defiant Def will get there in the end!That aside, I LOVE the narrative! Even though he says the same thing again and again I never get bored of it! The combat system is slightly 'off', but overall it is quite fun.I really enjoy playing this game and even though it needs a lot of work, I see great things with this game! "

Every encounter being different, you're still able to forge your own journey your way. The game manages to make me use my imagination through it's unique story telling and for that I say it's a solid game.However, the one drawback with this game is that the combat seems very clunky and too easy. With a simple flick of ""Q"" I'm countering enemies like I'm playing Batman. Even with the seemingly robotic and ease that the combat is, I promise it's worth checking out.I give this game a solid 8.5/10			"

												To summarise - an atmospheric, rewarding and compelling game. There are other sources to explain how the game works so I won't re-explain that but I will highlight its key points.You build a deck of equipment and encounters, then run the level with that deck of cards, making progress towards expanding your deck (and thus your options), and in the middle of all that you engage in short third-person fights with creatures/enemies. And in the middle of ALL of that, you are continually listening to the comments of the dealer, the writing for which is superb and the voice acting for which really sets a very mysterious and compelling tone to the game. Added to that the animation as all this takes place, the atmosphere of the game is extremely enticing, full of exploration, mystery and intrigue.The deck building is compelling as it has a real impact on how you will play the level and has more depth that 'best equipment in, worst equipment out', actually requiring thought to get cards which may work well with your building of the encounters. Speaking of which, you also choose what the encounters are going to be during the level, mainly focusing on ones which you have not completed yet which in turn will expand your available cards. A very rewarding and compelling loop with surprising depth.The little battles are not too long or onerous and as they are very short and there is a lot of variety (some variety in enemies and variety in how you play based on what equipment you've managed to acquire, completely changing your abilities) they do not get repetitive quickly.The campaign is, as I have said, very atmospheric. It is all about exploring the encounters around you (as you don't know which ones they are), with success leading to rewards expanding your deck for the next run. There is a fair element of luck involved, which would be annoying if it weren't for the fact that you make permanent progress on each run even if you die, which means that you still feel like something was achieved.Overall, these factors combine to make a very compelling and enjoyable experience which is highly recommended for just about everyone, since it isn't really just a 'brawler' or a 'card building game' or any of those, but a great hybrid which takes the best elements from everything in my opinion. Add to that the updates by the developers, it is one to pick up and keep playing. (And the DLC also comes highly recommended as it adds yet another element to this great game!)			"

												Hand of Fate is an action, indie, RPG game developed by the Australian company, Defiant Development. This is one of the best action based tabletop simulators so to speak. The gameplay is very unique with a system which is enjoyable and challenging at the same time.The story of the game is quite simple, your goal is to defeat the narrator of the game, the fate weaver.  The campaign mode contains 12 bosses that need to be defeated and after each four rounds you gain additional bonuses while the enemies become stronger. The game essentially plays as tabletop adventures with cards shuffled face down and your main hero being a pawn moving. Many times the path has different shapes which can make it tricky when it comes to planning your route.The three main stats that are used in this game are health, gold and food. Health is usually either lost or gained in combat/traps/boons, gold can be gained in multiple ways while food is the resource that makes everything more challenging and interesting in Hand of Fate. Each movement costs one food and it is also used in many events which adds a whole new depth to the game.The other important factors in this game are the gear and blessings/curses. The hero can gain during his adventures multiple pieces of equipment as well as blessings from various events. Combos can make a huge difference in this game and some pieces or blessings can save your life. For instance, one blessing found during the game let me re-draw any attempt during chance cards, saving my butt many times when I could have ended up in a sticky situation. The system itself is based on four factors: success, huge success, failure, huge failure which usually will either reward you handsomely or make you cry. Another factor that makes this game insanely addicting is the tokens. Each time you resolve a challenge at the end of the round, you unlock new tokens which adds additional ways to customize your deck.The game excels in particular in the music and storytelling department. The music is absolutely amazing and combined with the storytelling of the fate weaver, it makes the experience even more refreshing. Each time you activate a card the story teller will make a snarky remark depending on the outcome. After the player finishes campaign mode, the game can be continued in endless mode which functions similar to the campaign but with points given for successful actions, the floor number reached as well as your other stats. This in turn can provide a very long and amazing experience in which you can either unlock the cards you missed or simply enjoy Hand of Fate. After each floor the game becomes harder due to the extra trap cards added.Overall, Hand of Fate is one of the best tabletop simulator games I have ever played which makes it a must-buy. I give the game a 9/10, a must have to any tabletop/RPG/card games fan.For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group "

Early Access Review
								Currently frustration outweighing fun for me personally.  Needs more balancing.  Certain cards produce encounters that are laughably easy and others that are pure hell.  You are literally at the mercy of total randomness in this game.  Queen of Dust fight brought realization as to how wierd and sluggish combat can be.  Combat tries to be like Batman Arkham games yet more linear and slow with one to two combat animations and no exciting combos to my knowledge.   Spent entire QoD fight lunge diving to evade and waiting to strike someone and thought to myself how ridiculous this mechanic is and has been in past fighting games.  If shield cards or blessings rolled may have been easier fight yet in my experience this is fith time fighting her and found nothing useful on my way to her so far.  Player seems to have enormous hitbox and compared to enemies and because of the stationary camera during fights it is easy to misjudge distance at a critical time.  Don't feel as if I am making any substantial progress in the game.  You unlock new cards but may never see them in a playthrough and more often than not they wont help you anyway (and can also possibly hurt you).  Once a new act is started you lose all equipment and have to pull from the deck all over again to gain items.  Mixed feelings about the game overall so far.			"

												I feel like I could sit around and play this game forever. The Game Master is your opponent. He sits across from you. Antagonizing, and narrating your every move. You best him and his cards/minions through puzzles, combat, and games of chance laid out before in a free to explore maze of face down cards.Success brings you gold, supplies, and equipment to brave his more challenging tricks, and traps. Each victory brings you better, stronger cards. Magical swords and armor. But, each success also gives him more cards to use against you. More traps and dangers for you to stumble into.Truly a great game, and a must have for your steam library.			"

												A really strange mix between a beat'em all and an RPG.The narrative part is very well done and you unlock differents parts of various stories as you complete challenges given by cards.Each card presents an event or an equipement, and each game shuffle your deck of events randomly to give you a challenge.The battle system is inspired by the Batman Arkham series and if not perfect (because it stays pretty basic), does its job.The RNG is present and sometimes can be a ♥♥♥♥♥. (Davy Jones, give me back my soul !). But the more vicious challenges tends to give the more interesting rewards (and if it's too hard, don't keep them in the deck). Several challenges are kept in the deck in order to unlock others events so you end up by keeping the difficult one only to complete them once.For an indie game, graphics are also really great and animations well executed.

												Great game, a combination of Rogue-like, Hack 'n Slash, and Cards. Tons of RPG elements, aloows you to buiild a deck in story mode and pick which cards are going to be played next game. Hard game to describe exactly but I definitely recommend it and if your wondering exactly what the game is about I suggest watching some gamneplay footage. Definitely playable, almost a finished product, and a must own game imo.			"

												I can't recommend this game enough. There's nothing like it. Ridiculous amounts of fun, and heartache, for a very reasonable price. Would gladly purchase additional DLC content. This game should stick around for a long time, it's a masterpiece. It would be a shame if you missed out.			"

TL;DR: Excellent visualization of what's happening in your head, when you play board-game IRLWe all love board-games, don't we? The only problem with them is that there's too much left for the imagination. If only there'd be a game with board-game rules and visualization of, say, Diablo III or Torchlight, or something similar... If you ever had a thought like that (and I know that I did), you're welcome to buy Hand of Fate as soon as you'll finish reading this review.Hand of Fate is a game that's very simple to play, yet very complex to explain: basically, it's a card game, where you move your token from card to card, encounter monsters, treasures and various obstacles. At the end of each scenario, you fight a boss. Though, the complex thing is that when you encounter an enemy, the game turns in something or an action-RPG with you controlling your hero, using skills and items to actually fight your enemies in real time.Graphics are good, I did enjoy both hacking and slashing, and browsing through on-board adventures (not all of the cards include you teleporting to the arena and fighting monsters, obviously enough). The dealer is a nifty masked dude with creepy yet charismatic voice (you might expect a new announcer with it in Dota 2, though), which follows his own rules and easily admits defeat if you slay his henchmen.As you progress through the storyline, you encounter more powerful enemies and gather a stronger loot. Every scenario is unique, thanks to the randomizer -- you can even call these levels procedurally generated, rogue-like style: every time you start over, both scenario decks (yours and dealer's) are shuffled, and you're getting a new adventure each time you start over.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I'd strongly recommend this game to all of the RPG fans out there -- it's a breath of refreshing air on the modern RPG scene, really. If you're not into RPG, you might want to check the game out anyway -- it's well-done and interesting to play overall.Rating: 8.9 out of 10.0			"

												A really strange mix between a beat'em all and an RPG.The narrative part is very well done and you unlock differents parts of various stories as you complete challenges given by cards.Each card presents an event or an equipement, and each game shuffle your deck of events randomly to give you a challenge.The battle system is inspired by the Batman Arkham series and if not perfect (because it stays pretty basic), does its job.The RNG is present and sometimes can be a ♥♥♥♥♥. (Davy Jones, give me back my soul !). But the more vicious challenges tends to give the more interesting rewards (and if it's too hard, don't keep them in the deck). Several challenges are kept in the deck in order to unlock others events so you end up by keeping the difficult one only to complete them once.For an indie game, graphics are also really great and animations well executed. Presentation is top notch. The amount of work in this gem should have been huge.Reminds me the books where you are the hero.The result is original, well refined, and gives a game that you actually want to complete.			"

												Admittedly I am not very good at this type of game yet but I've found it to be both fun and frustrating at the same time. The dealer is a narcissistic wind bag who spends most of his time boasting about all the warriors who have excepted his challenge , and then fallen by his hand (no pun intended) trying to beat him at his usually unfair scrimmage. For example win two food cards, lose 4 food on his very next move...and food is important because each move you make costs you 1 food...""oh I AM sorry"" he smugly spouts...and let's just follow that up with a lose half your gold card as well, making it harder for you to buy food . That's fair right? There are other examples as well but seriously, it is very aggressive and it's pretty much like that through the entire game. SO if you don't have patience at all for this kind of mental abuse, you should probably avoid this one to spare yourself a lot of unnecessary stress and quite possibly the death of your favorite controller or any other throw-able object nearby ...But  If you can handle the dealers cockiness it...it's a pretty cool and challenging game.

												I honestly am confused as to how this mish mash of different game mechanics are put together to make a game as good as this. If you don't want to read the whole review, here's a shortened version: Buy it. It's well worth the price.Pros:- As original as it can be- Great graphics- Deck building, providing a different experience every time you play- Combat is good, basically the same as in the Batman Arkham series- Choose-your-own-adventure style gameplay- Has an endless mode- The transitions are amazing- Sometimes has a bit of morbid humor added into itAnd much more pros that I don't even bother to type down since there are so many.Cons:- Gets a bit boring after about an hour or two of gameplay (but that's in my opinion, may differ per person)So yeah. It's a great game. You should buy it. Right now.			"

Pros:+ Roguelike collectible card game dungeon delver brawler roleplaying game+ The dealer's narration is spot-on and immersive; some of the best voice-acting I've heard+ Graphics and ambient sounds are amazingly detailed+ Customizable decks allow you to play like you want+ Fun side-adventures that have unexpected consequences+ Collecting cards through gameplay allows for deeper and varied customization of your deck to fit whatever is needed+ Manages to stay fun, fresh and challenging the whole way through+ Enemies grow stronger with you, challenges get harder, random chance gets stacked against you... it's great+ Rewards skill while still utilizing luck of the draw+ Overall polished final product - and it shows+ I have never felt this conflicted about beating a final boss+ Developers are invested and involved with the community; are releasing more new content to continue spicing up the gameCons:- Typical repetitiveness that comes with any roguelike game (Mr. Lionel, hello, give me my shield please and I'll be on my way)- Typical aggravation associated with chance-only games (that treasure chest cost me half my health with nothing to show for it)Overall:  This is a game that seems strange at first, but then after the first game, I realized I was playing something inspired.  You make your deck, then the dealer adds his own cards to it.  These cards make up the ""dungeon"" and are placed face down (mostly) randomly.  You move your avatar from one card to the next to explore each dungeon, turning the cards face up and resolving their events or encounters as you go along.  Maybe it's a shop, maybe it's an ambush, maybe it's an event where you get lost in the swamp, or goblins steal your equipment and you have to kill them before they escape.  The variety and depth is impressive.  Some events rely on skill (beating down goblins who just stole all your weapons, for example), while others rely solely on chance/luck of the draw (picking from 3 success cards and 1 failure card to climb safely down into a ravine, for example).  As the game goes on, it introduces more and more facets, all of which give another layer of chance and strategy.  Combat takes place like the Batman: Arkham Whatever games, where you just smack enemies until they fall over and counter when it tells you to, but it's still fun, and the enemies provide enough challenges to keep from being boring/easy.Bottom Line: Absolute recommend.  This is one of those rare times where a game tries to do a little of everything, and manages to succeed at it fantastically.			"

												TL;DR - There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this game. It's a bit slow, but it fits the game. There's a lot of reading, but it fits the game - it's a ""choose your own adventure"" type game. It's amazing. Strongly, very strongly recommended.Positives:1. Atmosphere. It's really well made. It's consistent with it's themes and atmosphere, the ambient noises, dark visuals, hand drawn beautiful cards, etc etc. 2. Presentation. Amazing. The way your avatar appears on the battlefield from a card, the way each item appears from the cards... The way randomness is made - you pick a card from a shuffled deck. Great ideas, and implemented very well...3. Variety. This game is a huge mix of CCG, RPG, Dungeon Crawler, Action Adventure, Exploration, etc etc etc... There is so much to do, there are so many different things to do, and all that is hidden so well in the cards and general gameplay mechanics... 4. Visuals. Yeah, it's not as great visually as Crysis or Witcher 3 or whatever. Still, the visual art style is fitting, consistent and overall really great looking, and that's the most important for visuals - to look good.5. Gameplay. That is kinda covered in the variety point, but again, you are playing a choose your own Dungeon Crawling adventure CCG with RPG elements, customizable equipment and fighting style, as well as doing quest chains, mini quest chains, beating guys up, well, everything. 6. The Dealer. Oh, the dealer... I will leave it at that. The dealer.???1. The game is a bit slow, but it have a lot of reading. So it's understandable. I don't consider it a negative, but some people may dislike the slow progression speed. Some rounds can go WAY over an hour if you read every encounter..2. There is a lot of reading. A LOT of reading. The writing is good, which helps, but still, there is a lot of text, that needs to be crunched. After a few rounds some basic cards will start repeating themselves, so repetition may become an issue. I still don't consider that a negative, but some people may not enjoy the literature aspects as much as me. "

												I'm going out of my way of not really bothering about reviewing games just to say this: -  If you don't like  any the multiple sub-genres involved in this game (deck-building, RPG, old-school tabletop, Rogue-like, Arkhan-like combat) just don't bother giving bad reviews, you won't get the message the game is trying to deliver (it could change your mind on those, hardly though); -  If you're new to  those genres, buy it and play with an open mind, don't give quick judgment and the game will show its beauty to you (don't just give up after a few plays);-  If you , like myself,  enjoy  most to all of the aspects of those genres, buy and play it, you'll surprise yourself with a richly complex and mysterious story inside this very much balanced (don't let the bad reviews get in your head) tabletop inspired (some luck involved, sometimes, and  not  unfair) and build your own adventure RPG. The combat element is tough, but satisfactory and rewarding, it's not 100% as perfect as some AAA titles but it does a good job and that's enough to have a good experience with the combat part. This is an indie game, so don't expect a perfectly polished game in all aspects, the Devs (who are such great guys and responsive towards the community) are constantly polishing and releasing patches (and DLCs) to fix and improve the game experience, so it just gets better and better.  TL:DR version  - Don't like the genres? Don't bother (but it would be nice of you if you bought it to help the indie community C: );- Aren't familiarized with the genres? Try it for yourself (truly do, you won't regret it) and don't let bad reviews get to you;-Like those genres?  YOU WILL ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS PIECE OF ART CALLED   HAND OF FATE.

			Hand of Fate is out on Steam for Mac, let's see what this fascinating game is like. Click Here To Subscribe  http://bit.ly/19ksM1a Website  http://www.alvalentyn.co Get the Game ...		

The game is extremely fascinating, combing a trading card game, with action rpg and rogue like. Many would have failed and given the public a hobbled mess of slapped on features. Instead Defiant have wonderfully crafted the game and mechanics, so as to make you feel like you're being guided by a Poker dealing Dungeon Master.I was pleasantly surprised by how well the it all blends together and plays. The game is still in development, and I have never liked the idea of Early Access, but Hand of Fate certainly has amazing promise. The music is good, although not finished, and the graphics despite using the unity engine runs and looks really well. Although sadly the maximum resolution was only 1920x1080. Something easily forgiven due to the game still actively being worked on.I certainly enjoy it, and I look forward to playing more as it develops.			"

												When I think about fantasy RPGs they tend to involve a whole lot of fighting and the occasional tavern break to play some dice or card games against the locals. In Hand of Fate you play cards with the occasional break for fighting. The combat is a little repetitive but encounters never last very long and is still fairly enjoyable. The card game itself, though, is great - a sort of progressive deck-builder with dealer-supplied cards thrown in to shake things up. You move across a randomised map of location cards, resolving the conflicts on each as you pass them, and gaining (or losing!) loot and resources as you make your way to the boss for the level. Then you start again for the next level... but with a couple new cards, a few new story items and a new item or two up for grabs.The style, story and narration are also quite charming and really add to the overall feeling and aesthetic of the game.

												This game has an incredibly fun pace.Starts off very easy and enjoyable and as it progresses and enemies get tougher, so does the cards. Suddenly you find yourself constantly getting into really tough challenges near the end.A bit too RNGish, specially at the very last level, as you need some good equipment to be able to beat the end boss. Which is a challenge too, takes a few attempts before beating it.Great game, they tried something completely different and really worked. The atmosphere is great, the voice acting is impressive, good music.I'd say it's worth buying even if it's not in a sale.Let's hope more developers make refreshing games such as this one!			"

												I am normally HORRIBLE at games like this but I've been having a blast so far!!I am really enjoying the way the cards work, the story, and the voice acting is spot on as well. Many games neglect the voice acting so it is always very refreshing when it is done well in an Indie title such as this. :)My only gripe is that I feel like the combat is a little awkward with the camera angles. I've learned to adapt and can still play just fine but sometimes it gets a little frustrating trying to block incommng blows if you get a poor angle on your hero. That is really my only complaint though which is really just a tiny nit pick more than a game breaking problem. :POther than that, I just love everything. Even playing with the cards that the computer recommends haha. Honestly this game is worth the full price of $24.99 so I wouldn't hesitate in grabbing it along with the wildcard DLC. Supporting the devs of well made Indie games helps them to grow and make more treasures for us to play. Cheers.			"

Posted: July 8, 2016
												NOTE: This review just covers the cons. If you'd like to read about what's good in this game just read one of the positive reviews--I agree with everyone else on the pros of this game, but unfortuantely the cons outweight the pros imo so I focus on them for that reason. What begins as a wonderful game full of fun and interesting play eventually becomes just another test of player versus sadistic game developers that's so common these days. The more you love this game, the more you'll end up hating it once you near the end.Unfortunately for players, the way this game ramps up difficulty is to cheat. By the time you reach the last level of the ""story"" mode (there's no story), the game is so unbelievably cheaty that it robs a very fun game of 100% of the fun it had previously contained. Just so you know what I mean: the last boss battle takes place in a 10 foot square environment so there's virtually no room to avoid the enemies. The problem? Just getting to the battle generally costs you between 30-50% of your health so you always start the battle at 65% or less health (due to curse cards on the last level which hit you every few turns so there's no way to avoid permanent health losses no matter how you play). The enemies surrounding the boss are all invincible until the boss is killed. But you're in a tiny environment so you can't dodge the enemies, and also they all protect the boss so you can't really get to him either. Invincible foes is the game developer equivalent to a slap in the face. It's a big F U to players that makes it very clear the developers enjoy punishing us for playing their game. There is no place in games for invincible enemies--it's a BS way to make a game harder that can only be described as cheating unless the player also has the ability to become invincible. What is so frustrating about this game is that it has so much potential completely spoiled by anti-player decisions which ruin the fun.I can't recommend this game because it's the most frustrating kind of game out there: the kind that draws you in, gets better and better, then because of really bad developer decisions becomes just a torture fest of ""Can I get that 1 in 100 run where I can pull off a miracle based entirely on luck."" I HATE games that force the player to rely entirely upon luck to succeed, and unfortunately by the end of the ""story"" mode, that's exactly what has happened. The game begins with maybe 25% luck and 75% skill and strategy but by the end it's more like 85% luck, which is FAR too high for any game under any circumstances. Also worth mentioning (even the most positive reviewers mention this as a negative) is the extremely generic and not-so-great battle system (which is about 40% of what you do in the game). You roll around and endlessly kite groups of enemies until you can catch one of them off on his own and get a few hits in before kiting again. Also, some of the camera angles in this game are so bad they can and will get you killed. I seriously haven't seen this bad of a use of camera angles since the early days of Resident Evil. It's truly shocking how bad the camera angles can be sometimes.On top of those issues, the narrator drones on and on endlessly and he only has like 8 or 9 things that he says for normal cards you frequently encounter, so you keep hearing him say the same boring thing over and over and over and over. It's maddening. When you first start playing, it's all very charming and wonderful, but by the 400th time of hearing him say the same thing (there's no way to skip or mute his monologues) it's gets really annoying and definitely takes away from the replay value.I hope the devs make better decisions for Hand of Fate 2, which is currently in development. I feel like this game had great potential and I believe that if they fix these glaring (imo game-breaking) problems they could have one of the best games in a long time. The parts of Hand of Fate that work, WORK. It's an incredibly fantastic game CONCEPT, but unfortuantely miles away from a fantastic game. Fingers crossed, I'd certainly check out Hand of Fate 2 when it comes out. I'd give this one a pass.			"

												As a lover of adventure games like D+D and card games as well as combat styled games like Batman and AC, this game is just a match in heaven. Picked it up as it was a steal on steam sale and thought I'd try it out, didn't expect to end up playing it pretty much none stop for 3 days straight. Its a very intelligent and rewarding game. Great replay value with endless mode, my only negatives are that the combat can be a little 'sloppy' in moments and I wish the deckbuilding was a little more indepth but these are just nitpicks on a very enjoyable game.

												While this game might be rather innovative yet in some odd way retro edging to text adventures and I therefore might recommend it, I do think that the opinions voiced here are way too positive. The game setup with the cards feels nice but everything in between to me is rather bland.The combat is too easy and generic and the high luck factor is something that I know will get me upset if I will keep playing that and should die due to it. To me the game started to feel very repeatitive really early on and I doubt it will grow different. Still willing to give it a chance.			"

Posted: July 25, 2016
												After finally reaching the end, I can no longer recommend this game.  The ♥♥♥♥♥how that is combat in HoF frequently makes the game an infuriating chore, and the final boss fight is downright insulting.  After spending roughly 1/5th of my playtime fine-tuning my deck, doing repeated runs, and failing in the final boss encounter many times, I refuse to try again.  Some of those deaths were undoubtedly my fault, some due to bad luck in previous encounters (it is a roguelike, afterall), but most of them came from the shoddy combat.Here's what you can expect in fights: Getting stuck on invisible bits of geometry, that enemy AI seamlessly glide past.Not being able to interrupt your own attack in order to block or deflect projectiles, an absolute necessity to survive.A mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fixed camera that you have zero control over (causing you to constantly lose sight of enemies while evading).Maps so terrifically small and cluttered that fights with multiple enemies (or several large ones) can make it impossible to reliably target the enemy you want, because you can't see it behind the others.When fighting, any enemies knocked down or stunned will immediately get up and attack you when you try to finish any other downed enemy.  No matter how long the duration of a knockdown or stun is meant to be.As your combo goes higher, the screen becomes progressively darker, blurrier, and more red.  Most of your broken combos will be due to squinting at the screen.Many enemies will stand off-screen (remember the fixed camera?) and throw/shoot projectiles at you, but the indicator that something is being hurled at you is not always long enough to reach your screen.  Even if it were, at end-game there are so many enemies, so much clutter, and such a tight, fixed camera angle that you won't see them anyway.Enemies performing unblockable power attacks from a standing position will occasionally glide across the floor like it was glass, shooting straight at you.And, finally:Broken enemy targeting, creating issues such as: Missing the enemy you're aiming for, and hitting a shielded enemy that breaks your combo.  Being sucked in to the three-hit ground finisher, causing you to get hit/shot in the back. Hitting a pot (or other container) instead of an enemy. Ruining your combo by simply swinging in an entirely wrong direction, hitting nothing.If I sat and thought about it, I could probably come up with more flaws in the combat.  Instead, I'll say this: Hand of Fate has sold tens of thousands of copies, has several thousand positive reviews, and has only been completed by ~4% of the people who own it.  And, I've recently discovered, many of those people finished the game on Apprentice (Easy) not Adventurer (Normal) difficulty.  They likely wouldn't have had to, if you could reliably control your character in fights.Don't take my word for it, though.  Most of the glowing reviews for this game end with an admission that the combat becomes garbage by end-game. Skip past the first ten glowing paragraphs from the current top review (found here), and you'll even see it there.The sequel is in Early Access, I'd suggest waiting.  Hopefully they will have created a version of Hand of Fate that you won't be disgusted with by the end of it.			"

												I'll start by saying that I want to love this game. The atmosphere is incredible, the pretense for the story delivered through a card based roguelike dungeon is genius in how it capitalises on the strengths of both card games and roguelikes. Even the ambitious combat scheme is generally pretty engaging (if flawed in a few small ways). I adore a lot of what the game is doing. That said, I can't recommend it in its current state.I originally wanted to say that the game is too difficult, but that's not true. The game is outright unfair. I'd be fine with the game being difficult, because difficulty implies a requirement for careful application of thought and skill. This is not what this game offers. Especially nearer towards the end of the game, there are an incredible amount of cards the dealer plays that may as well read ""Player loses game"". For an example, in the final encounter I'd unlocked before giving up, the deck was stacked with entirely uncounterable cards that reduce maximum life by 50%. It wasn't uncommon for my health bar to consist of a maximum single hit point by the third floor, if I was lucky enough to make it that far.I've read on the Steam forums that as of the 2nd of July a rebalance patch has been planned, but with no current ETA I cannot recommend buying this game unless you are a) the proud owner of a 16 leaf clover or b) a supreme masochist.

Early Access Review
								This game is loads of fun, and really addictive. It combines a simple-to-learn (but challenging) combat system with the randomness of an old-school story-telling collectible card game (such as Mythos). In short, each session you navigate your character through a serious of cards (that represent scenarios) in a game. Each card is effectively a random chance for loot, health, upgrades or monsters. When a monster card is drawn, you fight the monster(s) in a third-person view and gain treasure. At the end of a ""game"", you fight a boss monster. If you win, you gain new scenario cards and bosses to add to your deck. Each time you play, the cards are shuffled - so your scenarios are randomised as well!Each session is quick, and exciting. I recommend this to fans of the boardgame Talisman, CCGs and action fantasy games. There are hours of fun to be had in this little gem.			"

												TL;DR: Good Idea. Very Mediocre execution. Get it when it is highly reduced (66% and higher). Not worth the full price.__________Pros:Good, very immersive narration.Compelling gameplay design, despite the terrible combat.High replayability value.Very stable, crashes are very rare.Very accessible, it is easy to get in and start playing, no hour long tutorials.Good saving system. The game saves your progress very frequently, so even if you crash at some point (which is very rare), you can still restart the game and continue playing pretty much off where you left.__________Cons/Issues:The Combat System is pretty terrible and boring, pretty default button mashing with some QTE and hammering of space button to dodge. Camera viewport is also locked in position that follows the player.UI and the interaction with it is flat out terrible.Sometimes you get the entire board revealed to you, but you can't zoom in onto the board to see which cards are which so the revealing was entirely pointless because you can't see anything.The cursor for menu selections sticks to the screen stupidly when playing with the mouse, making you pick choices you didn't want and you get royaly f**ked. Pretty terrible.Alot of game mechanics are not explained to you, like if you uncover an event that requires you to have a better weapon, can you return to that event if you get one? Nobody knows,♥♥♥♥♥♥isn't explained.The game itself is poorly optimized on the visual side, with frequent framedrops which shouldn't be happening. The game is just not worth it at full price.			"

												Okay, so this game is REALLY unique and cool. You play as a recently-deceased man who has passed onto the afterlife, and is reliving broken memories of his life in the form of a card game, played against a mysterious hooded figure known only as ""The Dealer."" The game's cards correspond to various memories of the man's life; trials he may have endured, enemies he may have faced, and the items and powers he may have wielded to vanquish his foes. Don't be fooled, though; this is definitely NOT a card game. It is more like a text-based choose-your-own-story adventure game, interspersed with hack-'n-slash combat encounters. The cards you possess on the table manifest themselves as equipment and abilities in the combat portions of the game, which are crucial to being able to take on the enemies you will face.The combat encounters will seem very familiar to anyone who has played the Assassin's Creed or Witcher games. The flow of combat follows the same attack/dodge/counter system that players will recongize from those titles. The real brilliance of the game comes from the sheer replayability. You're dead, after all, so the Dealer is perfectly content to sit at the table and play cards with you for the rest of eternity, and once you get the hang of the game, you might be, too. Matches take the form of multi-level dungeons, the floorplans of which are laid out face-down on the table, using a mixture of cards chosen by you, and by the Dealer. As you win matches, the dungeons become longer, harder, and more complex, but always different. Winning matches will earn you new cards, which equate to new weapons and armor, stronger powers, and even persistent quest-lines that you can explore or replay over the course of multiple matches. As you become more skilled, though, the Dealer will become increasingly frustrated with your success, and throw even harder obstacles in your way. Despite there being only one fully voiced character in the game, the Dealer's voice acting, model, and animations are rich and full of character, and you may even find yourself reveling in your rivalry as much as he does. Overall, this game is a solidly designed, well-polished, and unique experience that any mortal would be pleased to devote the rest of eternity to.			"

												Gameplay video & Thoughts below:http://youtu.be/haHtT2QYn6A?a So far I'm loving every second of Hand Of Fate, the progression through each section is beautifully done with a great voice actor for the game master and animation of the board and cards. Each card changes you path for greater or for worse, offering you chances of possibly great loot but could also take items or health from you just as fast. The writing is great from the card text to the spoken word of the game master. Combat however while I love how you are summoned into a battle sequence from the cards the actual combat still feels a bit shaky. It's slow and doesn't feel as fast as I would expect. It works but it does still feel like it needs a bit more polish to make it feel more responsive. Ultimately a great game for building adventures feeling like a classic adventure book/card game.

												Hand of Fate in a nutshell could be described as ""what if Supergiant Games made a narrative rogue-like"". The trouble is, while the rogue-like aspect of the game is both fresh and innovative, the narrative side of things leaves much to be desired. First, the Good; This game is probably the most innovative take on the rogue-like genera I've played in months, if not years. The gist of it is that you create two decks, one of equipment cards and another of encounters, and then the storyteller adds a few more encounters based on what particular scenario you are playing. Resolving encounter cards sometimes rewards you with more encounters, as does clearing the final boss of each scenario. Encounters are quite flavourful and sometimes require lateral thinking to get the best (read: more encounters!) rewards, or a little bit of trial and error over the course of several scenarios can also do the trick. Combat switches to 3D environments based on descriptors found in the triggering encounter, and is fast and simple, being quite reminiscent of the combat gameplay of the Batman Arkham games. To wrap up the good side of things, combat rarely feels “unfair” as it sometimes can feel in rogue-likes, but don't you worry, because this game packs a mean RNG in it's encounter resolution mechanics for when chance is involved. Basically, combat can be mastered but encounters require a generous dose of luck to clear sometimes. Now, the Bad, or rather the Disappointing; The narrator. Just... The narrator. I said that this game is almost akin to the games made by Supergiant Games, in that the use of a narrator is central to the experience, but while Supergiant have proved over the course of both Bastion and Transistor that they know how to write unobtrusive, clever and dynamic narrators, it's really not the case with Defiant Development's Hand of Fate narrative. The issue is not the voice actor, not at all, but rather the script he reads and the way it's implemented. Expect to hear lines repeat, or play at really dumb junctions (for example, I had no shield and won one as a result of an Encounter, to which the narrator quipped with surprise something to the effect of “Really? Do you think that's the best choice?”. Yes, yes indeed a weak shield is still better than no shield. Difficult to get across but he has tons of these odd responses that just grate.), or just in general have him say stuff that someone might have thought was deep and/or mysterious but comes across more like pretentious drivel. The end result is that I play the game with Voice Volume muted and subtitles on, so I can at least chose to ignore him when he gets particularly grating. Now granted, Supergiant's games are linear and as such little repetition of dialogue was ever a problem, while Hand of Fate runs into the Oblivion-esque “Mudcrabs Topic” issue of procedurally pulling dialogue from a list: sooner or later the list starts repeating, or plays a comment at a dumb point, or is just filled with bad lines. I don't know, this feels like quite a let-down in such a narratively driven game. At least the encounters can more or less stand on their own merit and tell their own story, so his muted absence is no big loss in my book. Conclusion; If you are a rogue-like fan, pick this up, though expect it to not be as challenging or ruthless as you might be accustomed to. If you are a fan of non-linear storytelling and an interesting story, pick it up as well, but if he gets too much just mute him, no big loss. Otherwise, check a video review or two on YouTube for some hands-on analysis. I'm still happy enough to give it a broad Recommend.			"

The game's cards correspond to various memories of the man's life; trials he may have endured, enemies he may have faced, and the items and powers he may have wielded to vanquish his foes. Don't be fooled, though; this is definitely NOT a card game. It is more like a text-based choose-your-own-story adventure game, interspersed with hack-'n-slash combat encounters. The cards you possess on the table manifest themselves as equipment and abilities in the combat portions of the game, which are crucial to being able to take on the enemies you will face.The combat encounters will seem very familiar to anyone who has played the Assassin's Creed or Witcher games. The flow of combat follows the same attack/dodge/counter system that players will recongize from those titles. The real brilliance of the game comes from the sheer replayability. You're dead, after all, so the Dealer is perfectly content to sit at the table and play cards with you for the rest of eternity, and once you get the hang of the game, you might be, too. Matches take the form of multi-level dungeons, the floorplans of which are laid out face-down on the table, using a mixture of cards chosen by you, and by the Dealer. As you win matches, the dungeons become longer, harder, and more complex, but always different. Winning matches will earn you new cards, which equate to new weapons and armor, stronger powers, and even persistent quest-lines that you can explore or replay over the course of multiple matches. As you become more skilled, though, the Dealer will become increasingly frustrated with your success, and throw even harder obstacles in your way. Despite there being only one fully voiced character in the game, the Dealer's voice acting, model, and animations are rich and full of character, and you may even find yourself reveling in your rivalry as much as he does. Overall, this game is a solidly designed, well-polished, and unique experience that any mortal would be pleased to devote the rest of eternity to.			"

												This game is an extremely unique card game. The graphics are really nice and I've only came across a few bugs since I've been playing it, there are quite a few bosses and even once you beat the game you're able to play endless mode where you just keep going on dungeon after dungeon until you can't open your eyes any longer, lol. It's got hours of fun just ready to being played. If you have the spare cash, this game is most definitely worth the buy.			"

												This game is amazing, it just keeps getting better the more I play (With new weapons, armor, scenarios, etc). I decided to write this after recieving the Guardian Angel Blessing card (lets you redraw a chance card, which is amazing) and decide this game deserves a review.Plays like Dungeons and Dragons with a guy using Tarot Cards to assemble the campaign. Lots of random elements and tons of content to play through (Good replayability).I'd highly reccomend this game, especially if it ever goes on sale.Edit: Last Story Campaign is pretty freakin hard.

												So, I bought this game while it was on a holiday sale. I had never heard of it, but I thought, ""It's cheap, it looks neat, I'll give it a chance.""  Well, my mistake was not noticing the DLC while it was on sale. A week or two later, I completed the game and am still unlocking cards. Wait, why can't I use the DLC content? OH, I didn't know that existed.Oh well, this game is worth it. I'll pay the full price for the DLC. Done, now I'm going to try the DLC stuff.Two days later, (I.E. Today), guess what happens. Oh look, It went on special again, and so did the DLC, whoops!Still, I have no regrets. This game was worth it, and the DLC was worth it at full price. I beat this game and am still going back to unlock and discover new encounters I haven't experienced.  "

												Gameplay video & Thoughts below:http://youtu.be/haHtT2QYn6A?a So far I'm loving every second of Hand Of Fate, the progression through each section is beautifully done with a great voice actor for the game master and animation of the board and cards. Each card changes you path for greater or for worse, offering you chances of possibly great loot but could also take items or health from you just as fast. The writing is great from the card text to the spoken word of the game master. Combat however while I love how you are summoned into a battle sequence from the cards the actual combat still feels a bit shaky. It's slow and doesn't feel as fast as I would expect. It works but it does still feel like it needs a bit more polish to make it feel more responsive. Ultimately a great game for building adventures feeling like a classic adventure book/card game. Love it!			"

								Very different from what I normal play but is definitly worth the $25. Choosing your deck in terms of what you hope to pick up in your quest along with the cards you must encounter along your path till you meet the boss. Good amount of different weapons/armor/abilities and plenty of different scenarios with all fate and no luck. Also in very good shape for being Early Access.			"

												This game is pretty fun.  The main ""story"" starts off easy enough, and with the new difficulty cards, you can tailor the challenge to your own desire.  At the end, it gets incredibly challenging, requiring careful planning and an understanding of the game to actually beat.  The endless mode is also very fun, and there's a lot of new cards to unlock by following their unlock paths.  The only main problem is that the combat, while fun, can get rather repetitive.  The Batman style combat isn't bad, however, but with it dictating all of the combat encounters, a little more variety would breathe more life into the game and allow players to experiement more and increase diversification in playstyle.  Still a very fun game, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this sort of genre.			"

												""You play the hand you are dealt""A brilliantly creative indie game where you play against a card dealer fighting through encounters with equipment all in the form of cards. The game mechanics themselves are simple but solid but serve mainly as a vessle for its better elements, the lore and style. The thermatics of this game are expertly managed, often with slippets of lore being dropped by your nemisis the superbly voiced and acted ""dealer"", an enigmatic and charismatic foe. One of the problems worth mentioning is that the random elements can sometimes kill a player too easily especially at the early levels (where a large enemy type in a small stage often means certain demise). But as a whole the games merits far outweigh its faults.			"

								I want to make a couple things clear before you continue with this review. I am very hard to keep entertained, and I am very picky about games. That being said, even in it's Beta stage Hand of Fate is one of the best games I have ever played. It mixes together all the fun of a tabletop game, with the enjoyment of an RPG, and sprinkles in some humor. This game is a treasure for anyone looking for a new IP to get behind. I can only hope that it has a long life with many more installments in teh future to come.From customizing your own adventure deck (and watching those choices come back to bite you), even up to getting to pick what weapons and armor are waiting for you. You have a huge hand to play in your fate, becareful what you wish for, because it may be the one thing that kills you.			"

												TL;DR: Good Idea. Very Mediocre execution. Get it when it is highly reduced (66% and higher). Not worth the full price.__________Pros:Good, very immersive narration.Compelling gameplay design, despite the terrible combat.High replayability value.Very stable, crashes are very rare.Very accessible, it is easy to get in and start playing, no hour long tutorials.Good saving system. The game saves your progress very frequently, so even if you crash at some point (which is very rare), you can still restart the game and continue playing pretty much off where you left.__________Cons/Issues:The Combat System is pretty terrible and boring, pretty default button mashing with some QTE and hammering of space button to dodge. Camera viewport is also locked in position that follows the player.UI and the interaction with it is flat out terrible.Sometimes you get the entire board revealed to you, but you can't zoom in onto the board to see which cards are which so the revealing was entirely pointless because you can't see anything.The cursor for menu selections sticks to the screen stupidly when playing with the mouse, making you pick choices you didn't want and you get royaly f**ked. Pretty terrible.Alot of game mechanics are not explained to you, like if you uncover an event that requires you to have a better weapon, can you return to that event if you get one? Nobody knows,♥♥♥♥♥♥isn't explained.The game itself is poorly optimized on the visual side, with frequent framedrops which shouldn't be happening. The game is just not worth it at full price.			"

												Hand of Fate is  a strangely addicting mix of dungeon crawler, rpg and card collecting games. The game plays like a Roguelike with all encounters and items being randomly placed while the combat is reminiscent of simpler RPG games with a plethora of weapons, items and spells to combat your enemies. You can only encounter about 10% of the cards at first while you play to earn more, both increasing your chance at good loot on your next journey AND often making the game harder by adding more special encounters.In short, GOOD:- Combat can be pretty hard at the start, but feels very good to get better at.- Nice variation of monsters, bosses and other enemies. You can't have an RPG without cool enemies!- The Dealer is an interesting character and serves to make the game feel really alive.- Feels great with a 360 controller- Graphics and loading times are pretty good although it doesn't seem very optimised, which could result in framrate loss depending on your computer.- Enough originality to make you want to unlock more and more cards to see what more the game has to offer.- Addictive and can be played in short bursts AND long runs depending on how you like to play.- The studio guarantees more content for this game, so that means lot's of more stuff to explore in the future.NOT SO GOOD:- You miss half your combat moves at the start of the game, you can't even block. It feels good to unlock more stuff, but I remember really hating the first part of the game where I could only dodge all the time. This can make you put the game down before you even really start.- As it's basically a Dungeon Crawler the randomness factor can really mess you up sometimes. I guarantee you that you will have a run going great only to be ruined by an encounter card you couldn't possibly beat with your current equipment/health/whatever.- The Succes-Failure card system. On MANY encounters you're supposed to watch how he shuffles to choose the correct card, but it's basically impossible 80% of the time either because of shuffle speed is way too fast or because all the cards are layered over each other in a way you can't follow them. Feel a little too unfair.- Story mode might just be a bit too unfair, with luck kinda winning the game for you. Don't expect to kill the King of Scales without any stunning weapons. If the game doesn't give you any even after succesfully completing all encounters, then you're simply boned and ahve to start all over again.- No in-depth options to try and optimise some of the graphic problems this game has.Randomness aside the game actually has a pretty intruiging overarching story and the Dealer is a well-acted, expressive and likable character that gives the game most of it's tone. All in all I'm quite happy about my purchase. I'm sincerely hoping for some more content in the future which could hopefully also fix some of the more broken problems with the game.NEVERMIND DISREGARD ALL THAT YOU JUST GOT A +40 CURSE CARD INSTADIE ENJOY THE GAME.^^ the reason why I quit playing ^^			"

												Clever game. Highly suggest acquiring and playing it.It's difficult to describe -- you follow the game as if you'd be playing a tabletop RPG using cards for encounters, while the fights are classic 3rd person view battles in 3D. It includes inventory management (scaling your character) and resource management (health, food, gold). There some cards which represent skill check - pick one of four face-down cards to see the outcome (success or fail) -- it may appear like luck, but you can actually trace the cards while they are being shuffled.Also manages to do a decent amount of story telling in this odd format.9/10 would draw again			"

								Incredible game, really unique and fun, has that ""just one more factor"" going for it! I really hope that the devs add more cards and scenarios, enemies etc., could see this having a lot of expansions to give it even more variety. Well done! Can't wait to see where they take it!			"

												I got this with the Humble Freedom Bundle. I started off really enjoying this game, and was digging the deck building aspect, with the combat system as a nice bonus. However, the longer the game went on the less I was enjoying it. I played the King of Skulls level, 75% of the way through the game, about a dozen times before I just gave up in frustration.The roguelike elements of the game are just not balanced correctly for the difficulty and RNG, and I found myself trapped in a loop where I needed to draw better weapon & equipment cards to be able to reliably beat the random combat encounters, but instead drawing encounters that would either inevitably kill me or were designed in such a way (hello White Minotaur, you miserably stupid pile of dung) that getting through them was a total slog.In particular, I had multiple encounters where I drew two bosses from earlier levels, which with the starting gear were basically unkillable when paired with a dozen mooks. The ranged attacks in particular start to happen so often that you can't block or counter all attacks, ensuring you will (eventually) take so much damage the level becomes unbeatable.When coupled with the fact that the game insists on showing you every card flipping animation, store loading animation and level setup animation, I just couldn't take it anymore.Also, the RNG is just a royal, unfun pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Theoretically you can follow the cards when there is a single shuffle, but on multiple shuffles it just isn't possible (regardless of what smart alecks on the Interwebs claim) and it would be kinder to just tell me if I pass a 25% chance instead of forcing the player to pointlessly scroll across cards, pretending that it matters.So while there are some really interesting ideas in Hand of Fate and it starts promising, and the voice acting and art remain fantastic throughout, it ultimately is a very poor set of cards the game deals you.

Early Access Review
								First I must say i didn't finish the game yet, i'm about half way into the game, with this said i think it's a great game so far, with a great idea, the queen of dust needs serious nerfing in close quarters she's impossible to deal with, you have to dodge her attcks and run around constantly just to avoid the balista, just so you can land one attack and start the dance again, i feel the cards are a little unbalanced still, its more easy to lose then to win, or you gain only one piece of equipment but lose 50 hp in the process, i understand that luck plays a big part in the game, but i feel there is more bad luck then good at the moment, the Angry mob card seems to be bugged still i tried everything but i still cant get the coin, maybe i'm doing something wrong, none the less i like the game so far can't wait for the full realese.

								After I played this game for 10 minutes i was already hooked! This game is so much fun. It's a card game/ dungeon adventure in which your goal is to find and defeat the boss in combat that is kinda like the batman series. you travel through a randomly generated dungeon which is made with your current deck. I've played the same level tons just because every time you play the game it is a different but all the same brilliant experience.The price right now may seem but a bit much but it is WELL worth it. I HIGHLY recommend you buy the game and support the game to help improve it. While the game is still in early access it is already worth the money!			"

												It's one of those games that asked whether it could but not whether it should.The action sections get in the way of the card game and the card game gets in the way of the action. Due to the divided attention both suffer. If you like third person combat get a game that focuses on that. If you like card games choose one that does that well. Mixing slow paced card gameplay and fast paced combat is more annoying than fun. Especially as everything is bogged down by slow animations and repetitive events.

												Hand of Fate is  a strangely addicting mix of dungeon crawler, rpg and card collecting games. The game plays like a Roguelike with all encounters and items being randomly placed while the combat is reminiscent of simpler RPG games with a plethora of weapons, items and spells to combat your enemies. You can only encounter about 10% of the cards at first while you play to earn more, both increasing your chance at good loot on your next journey AND often making the game harder by adding more special encounters.In short, GOOD:- Combat can be pretty hard at the start, but feels very good to get better at.- Nice variation of monsters, bosses and other enemies. You can't have an RPG without cool enemies!- The Dealer is an interesting character and serves to make the game feel really alive.- Feels great with a 360 controller- Graphics and loading times are pretty good although it doesn't seem very optimised, which could result in framrate loss depending on your computer.- Enough originality to make you want to unlock more and more cards to see what more the game has to offer.- Addictive and can be played in short bursts AND long runs depending on how you like to play.- The studio guarantees more content for this game, so that means lot's of more stuff to explore in the future.NOT SO GOOD:- You miss half your combat moves at the start of the game, you can't even block. It feels good to unlock more stuff, but I remember really hating the first part of the game where I could only dodge all the time. This can make you put the game down before you even really start.- As it's basically a Dungeon Crawler the randomness factor can really mess you up sometimes. I guarantee you that you will have a run going great only to be ruined by an encounter card you couldn't possibly beat with your current equipment/health/whatever.- The Succes-Failure card system. On MANY encounters you're supposed to watch how he shuffles to choose the correct card, but it's basically impossible 80% of the time either because of shuffle speed is way too fast or because all the cards are layered over each other in a way you can't follow them. Feel a little too unfair.- Story mode might just be a bit too unfair, with luck kinda winning the game for you. Don't expect to kill the King of Scales without any stunning weapons. If the game doesn't give you any even after succesfully completing all encounters, then you're simply boned and ahve to start all over again.- No in-depth options to try and optimise some of the graphic problems this game has.Randomness aside the game actually has a pretty intruiging overarching story and the Dealer is a well-acted, expressive and likable character that gives the game most of it's tone. All in all I'm quite happy about my purchase. I'm sincerely hoping for some more content in the future which could hopefully also fix some of the more broken problems with the game.NEVERMIND DISREGARD ALL THAT YOU JUST GOT A +40 CURSE CARD INSTADIE ENJOY THE GAME.^^ the reason why I quit playing ^^			"

												Clever game. Highly suggest acquiring and playing it.It's difficult to describe -- you follow the game as if you'd be playing a tabletop RPG using cards for encounters, while the fights are classic 3rd person view battles in 3D. It includes inventory management (scaling your character) and resource management (health, food, gold). There some cards which represent skill check - pick one of four face-down cards to see the outcome (success or fail) -- it may appear like luck, but you can actually trace the cards while they are being shuffled.Also manages to do a decent amount of story telling in this odd format.9/10 would draw again			"

												This game has massive potential but unfortunately didn't reach it.Card gameplay, concept, rogue-like / RNG additions, story telling, voice acting are very cool. Graphics are super crystal clear, sharp, well designed.However backbone of the game is fighting sequences and they are very bad, mazes are bad, fighting is super weak. So you collect items, money and loot to fight but when it comes to fight, it's boring unresponsive, animations are badly done. It's almost like they had this great idea but they couldn't execute it. They wanted to make fighting batman-esque but they failed in many levels. Animations, responsiveness, complexity, fun.... they all fail miserably short on fighting.If they change the fighting this would be one of the best games of recent years. With the current fighting I cannot really care whether I had a good upgrade, skill etc. Even a turn based simpler fighting would have make the game much better because then loot you collect to fight would matter, rather than dodge, dodge and spam (X) button.Hpoefully they'll make a HoF 2 and it'll have proper fighting gameplay that the player would care about.

												I got attached to Hand of Fate pretty quick.  It's a real fun role-play card game.  Basically you're sitting across the table of a card dealer or dungeon master, however you see it.  He deals you cards and that determines what enemies you fight, where you fight and items you get.  You also gain loot by chance by flipping cards or winning fights.  Sometimes there's a character on a card and you can select answers when they speak.  Unlike other card games, when the level and enemies have been drawn you're character is warped into that world and you really fight them!  I've found that the controls are just like the Batman Arkham series when using Xbox controller.  The game is fun right from the start and easy to figure out.ProsCard game and battle adventure gameEasy to learnGame outcome depends on cards drawn and player choiceGraphicsControlsConsPretty difficult at the end.  Most of the game plays easy but the ending can be unfair.Lack of game info.  While the game is easy to learn I wish it had an info page to give a breakdown on what everything does to serve as a reminder.  Like what cards do what, the rules on food, buying and selling, etc.  You just have to pick up on it as you play.			"

												**Note for Mac owners:- the OS X version performs noticeably worse than the Windows version on the same machine. Recommend you Boot Camp this.- I'm personally having problems with the controller support on OS X. They're looking into itOne of the most interesting RPGs I've played in recent years. Using cards to represent everything from encounters, monsters to equipment and stats, you start off with a limited deck but earn more cards as you beat major encounters, and can essentially customise the deck to stack encounters/drops in your favour or limit yourself for a more challenging game.As someone who is tired of the whole roguelike trend that's swept indie games recently, Hand of Fate is surprisingly fresh and isn't difficult for difficulty's sake. There's just the right balance of randomness with a consistent, well-written RPG experience, and superb narration (probably my favourite narrator since Bastion) and attention to detail to back it up.Very happy to see it out of Early Access. I had to stop myself from playing too much prior to launch!			"

												Sadly, while this is a good game, it's not worth $25. Blah blah blah... it's like a good D&D game, but the controls are utterly atrocious. The camera seems determined to stay in the wrong place, you have very little control over your attacks other than when you attack: always. You're always spamming your auto-aim blocks and slashes and hoping they hit what you want them to and not kill you. However, this IS the only thing wrong with it... I don't think they'll overhaul it by this point, but you never know. I guarantee the negative reviews will disappear if the combat is fixed.			"

												Extremely well put together card game with massive amounts or replayability. The combat scenarios are alot of fun. I love the animations when your gearing up of the cards dropping on you and turning into the items before you engage enemies. I've had a ton of fun with this game and you will too.			"

 Do you want to make your own dungeon? And then complete it? And then fail because you were meant to complete it this time? Well then ... welcome to the RNG heaven and hell Hand of Fate is a mix of roguelike, dungeon-crawler and deckbuilding game. While you play, the dealer will narrate what is happening on the board and you will obey while you fight your way to the dealer. GAMEPLAY  The gameplay in Hand of Fate can be separated in several categories starting with the Deckbuilding ,Card unlocking, ""Dungeons"" , Items, Encounters/Enemies and Combat. Let's get it started.  Deckbuilding Deckbuilding is the neatest of the features I liked in the game because as said it let you make your own Dungeon. While in Endless Mode you dont have deckbuilding because you use all unlocked cards , in Story you have to build your deck, matching the required number of cards for Encounters and Equipment. While you have complete freedom in your Equipment deck, in the Encounters one you will  see locked cards ( one of them is the end boss of the dungeon). Some of the locked cards can be removed by completing them but often leads to new locked cards. Card Unlocking Cards are being unlocked by receiving card tokens. And you receive card tokens when you complete an encounter for first time. And you harvest the rewards at the end of the dungeon ... or after you die( its cool that you arent being punished for dying since a lot of card unlocks can end up terribly for you) . Different cards got different requirments to be completed and gest the best of RNG doesnt mean you will get the token. Once you get to the part where token breaks to reveal cards you will be welcomed with a neat animation. From the token you can get new equipment, encounter cards or gain cards. There are several ""quest"" chains that are worth doing. The newly obtained cards contain no information until you encounter them in-game so you can only guess what may happen. Dungeons Once your deck is ready  the party starts. Dealer will setup the board with separating the different decks in piles and then he starts drawing encounter cards to form dungeon levels. Once everything is setuped you start hoping from card to card till you reach the end... your end or dungeon's end. During story every dungeon comes up with bonus ... curses which will improve your game experience(or make you rage) . Every dungeon in story mode ends up with a boss fight(if you find it before you die) that will unlocks new cards, including the next level. At the end you will unlock new cards(hopefully) and will be able to increase your deck variety. While in the dungeon you have to take care of your supplies: Gold and Food. Food is beiung used on every turn and heals you. Items/Equipment One of your deck is filled with equipment that you can use during your adventures, if you get lucky to find it. You have Weapons,Armored,Gloves,Helmets,Rings, Artifacts(skills) and Blesses/Curses. While you can hoard all the equipments, you can change your active items before fights so you have to be picky and hope for the best. You can have only 1 active item from each category apart from Rings and Blesses/Curses. Encounters can remove any kind of item without blessing/curses(unless its stated otherwise). There are a lot of different items with their own pros and cons. Encounters and Enemies Ah the Encounter Deck, no matter how many good encounters you put in it, there will be always some that will screw everything. There are different kind of Encounters, from straight fights to short text-based adventures. Almost every encounter comes with a lovely RNG that features cards and there are 2 kinds of RNG : Success/failure that are represented with Huge Success,Success,Failure and Huge Failure cards. The amount of cards you can pick is 4 but they depends on the encounter themselves but you always have at least 1 success/failure card and the amount of cards you have to pick from is 4 ; Enemies are also represented by cards . You have the 4 basic enemies Skulls(skeletons), Dust(bandits), Plague(rats) and Scales(Lizardmen) . Each of them got melee and range model which puts the enemy count to 8. While playing you can unlock additional enemies( I got so far Mages, Liches and Lava Golems) which put the enemy count up to 11 . And the Iceing on the cake is the boss cards. Once you beat the boss its being unlocked in the monster deck and with 12 bosses to unlock you put the enemy count up to 23. So enemy variety is quite big for this kind of Game. Combat Last but not least, the Combat. Combat is pretty straightforward. You have Melee attack, Weapon Skill,Artefact Skill, Counter, Stun and Dodge. So you can say that the combat is similiar to Batman or Kingdoms of Amalur but with lower budget. Enemies attack are slowed most of the time so you can react accordingly. If you have shield you can counter melee attacks or reflect projectiles but thats only if the prompt for attack glows green... if its red you better get the f* out of there.  There is a friendlyfire so you can use this to your advantage with good positioning so you can let enemies tank the range attacks. Now.. one thing that I noticed is often so long leaps when you counter enemies at distance or being stuck in animation with no time to react. My main issue with the combat is the camera. You cant rotate it so at times you have no idea what are you gonna face or where exactly the enemy is. Apart from that combat is fine. Story and Narration Story is pretty simple : you are an adventurer who stumbled upon Dealer's home and you are invited for a game but you are free to leave whenever you want. In the said game you have to defeat the Dealer but before that you must defeat his strongest warriors(on every warrior's level you will meet new challenges so GL). Simple yet well presented thanks to the strong Narration. Voice actor did his job superb but there is still something more to be desired from the writing. Still even when Dealer repeats himself is often in the mood of the situation and there are just a view occassions when the line will not be fitting the situation. Difficulty/Fates Now this is more about the DLC ""Wildcards"" . Fates lets you change your playstyle. In base game you have 3 fates that serve as Easy/Normal/Hard difficulty in other games but if you have the DLC you get access to 9 more fates with different stats that affect your playstyle. It's a neat addition but there is still room for improvment. Endless Mode Once you are done with the story, Endless mode seems best option to play it .. but I personally didnt like it since it kills Deckbuilding. In Endless Mode you play with all the unlocked cards you have and on every floor the Dealer gets stronger and stronger. Overall  Its a neat roguelike with forgiving RNG and superb quest design and narration. Its good for short playsession and for people who like to unlock all cards.			"

												tl;dr: good game, but expensive. 8/10I have to give Hand of Fate credit. The presentation and style, as minimal as it is, is impressive. The game itself offers a unique and potentially engaging experience. The mysterious dealer sets the perfect mood with his appearance and narration. The only problem is HoF is one of those style over substance sorts of games. The flow of the game is entirely determined through cards as they're flipped over, and its this.... hand... that determines your fate. (eh? eh? that's the pun in the game's title)Most of the time the game itself never goes beyond making a choice based on the card flipped and then selecting a shuffled card to determine if your action is successful or not. This in of itself isn't bad, but if you're looking for an action-y graphically intense RPG experience with deep lore, you won't find it here.Infrequently, there are action-y bits. Usually in the form of a fight. Sometimes as an obstacle course. They're good place holders and don't do anything particularly wrong, but the AI is typically predictable and easy to overcome if you're a well seasoned gamer even on the harder mode. The action areas are also cramped looking and claustrophobic feeling.Playing off its card based mechanics, the more you play and beat the game, the more and different cards you unlock, and the longer the new games you start become. Longer games translate into higher difficulty. This is one of those games where moves are a resource represented as food. Running out of food typically means you lose HP until you die and starving is typically how you fail in Hand of Fate.Hand of Fate does come together very well though. It works as a game and, most importantly, is enjoyable and fun. The only major complaint I have is there isn't enough content or variety to justify the $25 price IMHO.			"

												I can only agree with the many that this game has certain charm. The cards makes the game and while the combat isn't the best, and it might have served them better not to attempt something similar to the Batman Arkham games, it does fulfill its purpose. So yea, feeling on edge when the dice is rolled and trying to get through a scene makes it feel like a splendid mix of roleplaying, cards and a videogame. So join the fun and buy the game. If the pictures and reviews have caught your interest, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.			"

												I didn't really expect much when I bought this, but it looked intruiging so I gave it a try. And I'm happy I did so, because this game is pretty great. It's not easy to describe. You play cards like in a mixture of a collectible card game and a board game, but it has also RPG-mechanics, a little bit of story, quests, descisions and an action based combat system. At first I thought that the latter was a bit too simple but I gotta admit - it's a lot of fun. Very fast paced, reaction based and dependent on what cards you already got, concerning equipment and abilities. And then there's the dealer of course. And this guy .. he really doesn't want you to win. It's great how he tells you little stories about what's happening and next thing you know, he throws you one of his own cards in your way and all goes to hell. I really, really like this game and I'm looking forward to playing more of it.			"

												I first became aware of this game on WFT is Hand of fate. I loved the art style and the Batman like fighting style. Some people dont really care for the Batman style. Basically its one button to punch and one to block one button to stun and one other button to dogdge. I enjoy this because its easy to understand and easy to pick up on and it looks really good for the most part. The game has a deck of cards and you have a piece that you move around the cards. Differents cards have different stuff inside of them.So for instance a card could contain a weapon of some sort after going down a ravine. The game is very well written and the guy who is the dungeon master looks and sounds great. So for fighting its sometimes one card and sometimes its 2 card with enemies. Sometimes its a boss plus more enemies. However fear not because the game gives you power ups.Via armor and weapons. Some have fire and some have stuns. Also you can get poisin for weapons or stuns or sometimes you can get the knife card that flies in 8 different directions. GOod stuff. I really like the graphics of this game even the fight scene are enjoyable. Watching that slow motion final death blow to an enemy always makes me smile. Even more so if its a boss that  I kill.You can also re arrange the deck or have the computer do it for you. If your wondering how to change the gameplay like I was. Go into the deck building part and click on the middle card and here you can select different cards that can change the game rules its also comes in handy for the dlc. I am playing the monk card right now.So graphics are very sharp looking, sounds are good. My complaints about the game are few. Sometimes you can get a lousy hand and either die because of bad drops or no food. I am halfway done with the game so it seems like it might be a tad short. Maybe around 12 or 15 hours long? Perhaps less it does have an endless mode.Some on the forum have complained of the game being too dark after they switched to the newer unity engine. I have not had this issue and they did roll back the changes but some are still having issues. The fix right now is windowed mode.My only other nit pick is sometimes the traps are a real pain. You fight in rooms and some are small and some are big and loaded with traps. It does hurt the bad guys as well however. So thats fair. I am having a good time with the game and I really enjoy it. One more thing the developers seem to be very active on the forums and seem to care so thats a very good thing.A fun and unique game. Most games  last around 10minutes up to 20 minutes or perhaps a little longer. Not super long. Buy it and you can thank me later.			"

												This game is a lot of whimsical, fantasy-based fun that makes my inner board-game junkie happy.The concept of Hand of Fate is awesome on paper, and even cooler when put to work! It's really challenging, it makes you use your brain, it's addicting, and it's just a cool idea!Once you start off, you get the basic set of cards. And as you use those cards and advance through each level, you unlock more cards. Not only does this make you want to keep playing with the mindset of ""Oh man, I gotta use this new card I just got!"" - But it also allows you to unlock better cards you can use to overcome that challenges that come with the harder levels, in a FUN WAY. I'd like to stress that as much as I can - This game takes elements that make other games not fun, and turns it into something that is incredibly fun, in a way that puts other games to shame.I would reccomend, however, using a Gamepad controller for this game. When I played this game on Keyboard + Mouse I found it really confusing and complicated, and didn't have that much fun overall. Once I started using a controller (Steam Controller to be precise) it got a lot better. I wasn't fighting the controls anymore, I didn't have to keep asking myself ""Uhhh, does this button do anything or not? I can't remember..."" and it was a much more relaxing time for me.Also, me and my brother made up a little alternate gamemode where there are two people playing. One person picks the character, the deck, and the level for the other person to play through. So if you've got any friends or family around who wanna play games, there's an option for ya. :P			"

												A great game! Very well thought of game with a mixture of cards and action. This game has good narrative storyline, very polished gameplay, good bgm and sound effects. The game can also be quickly entertaining without having to spend alot of hours into it. It is easy to learn and pickup even with the lack of a subtle tutorial.In general this game allows you finish something like a quest given to you, and you gain a card token. After the end of each session, you open the card tokens revealing new adventures, new equipments that can be added into ur encounter deck, equipment deck and etc. This game is very well thought of because it uses a card interaction of allowing players to create their own encounters with a mixture of the dealers encounter cards. Very interactive gameplay. Players are required to do some sort of resource management from obtaining food resources, consuming food as each step taken requires you to consume one food resource. Sometimes you might think you will not gain anymore food, prompting you to quickly move on to the next level. One downside to this game is that by the time you are 80% completing this game. You realize that there are no new monsters and the background setting are always the same. But it's not a problem because the developers can choose to release new DLC's that feature new monsters and bosses in the near future.Overall, this is a great game that any gamer should add into their collection.

TL:DR--------------------------------Get this game, it's great and unique.Full Review--------------------------------I played a lot of this game on GOG before eventually grabbing it on the Steam sale, and every penny is worth it. The basic premise of the game is that you build a deck of cards that are used to sudo-randomly determine the course of your game, and using these cards you must defeat the Dealer's face cards. (Jacks, Queens, and Kings)There is a HUGE amount of content in the game, and the developers still seem to be adding updates. You can get new weapons and armor and encounters that can be drawn during play to give you an advantage and help you defeat the Dealer's minions.It is highly recommended that you get the Wildcards DLC, as this adds many new options for crafting a new style of play through the course of the game. Well worth the $5.			"

												Got it very recently on sale, this game is quite enjoyable so far.SoundAudio is great and the voice acting is on point(subtitles tend to lag sadly).Visuals.Pieces together the world wonderfully. Everything is communicated well so far. Not the worlds most amazing looking game, but it does what it does well.GameplayThe simplicity of combat is a bit sad but, as I am short played it could get more complicated. The interraction with everything is quite smooth. Left click yes, Right no, but you may also click the buttons displayed.I love the setting and banter from the ""Dungeon Master"", I would say it is worth a purchase, even more so with the sale price being a steal. Get the dlc as it adds some interesting alternate gameplay styles (similar to classes), and really adds some replayability outside of what is already there.Seriously, buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The game's not bad, but maybe not for full price. For 5$ - definitely worth it, for 10$ - worth it if you're into roguelike games.18 hours was enough to finish story mode and endless mode to wave 30 (on medium difficulty), and it doesn't feel like there is much replayability beyond this unless you're really into getting all the achievements.Combat is way more responsive than i thought it would be, so that's a plus. The type of battle is about on shadow of mordor/batman level (more simplified of course, but similar idea with hits/counters/finishes). Game has controller support too, which can make battle better/easier.Luck is a huge factor. Yes, you can get really bad runs with horrible loot and overpowered monsters, but you can also get great runs where everything goes super smooth. Skill also counts, if you're really good - you do have a chance of defeating toughest enemies with starting equipment, you just gotta pay attention and fight hard! "

												Excellent game with an incredibly interesting concept, and solid execution. Cards become your gear, encounters, everything, and many of them have tokens. By succeeding at that card's encounter, you get the token, which create new cards for future games. I'm playing the Story mode, and it's fantastic. I've progressively unlocked a bunch of different new stories that I'm encountering in future games.You choose your equipment and some of the encounter cards to build each match, and then the story setup you've selected adds cards. It's clever and works well.Most cards are choices rather than combat, with semi-random success, others are static choices that you can learn and rely on in future games. This creates a great mix of surprise and predictability.Combat is fairly basic but engaging - not the highlight of the game, but it doesn't hurt it either.Story mode (Guessing 6-8 hours playtime), endless-play mode, and then modifiers that change the way some things work.

Some of the tokens require some luck of the draw to get but everything is definitely doable.The only difficult fight I found was the boss at the end but if you get a good trip to him with the right abilities you can beat him.  The heal is really needed.  However, it is pretty easy if you get the damage increase per curse as you have a lot of curses when you get there.  That makes him much easier.After reading reviews I was skeptical, but it was fun.  The graphcis are nothing to write home to mom about, but the play through was enjoyable.  I do not think I will play through it again, but I did enjoy it.If you catch this on sale, it is really worth a play through.  If you are looking for hack and slash or building up a character to just go one shot everything, this is not the game for you.  If you like a little strategy, luck of the dice, and some chance involved, this will keep you interested. "

												It's  a rare occurence for an experimental game with mixed genres to succeed, but this game nailed it. Imagine a combination of Yugioh and Batman Arkham Series. Now mix them with unforgiving nature of roguelike genre, then you get this game. The battle is fun, thank to Arkham series rhytmic fight style. The amount of card combination you can use in your deck won't bore you for quite a long time. But I think this game need a little rebalance, especially with encounter chance and THAT last battle. Seriously, this game get kinda unfair near the end game. You need both LUCK and SKILL to succeed. Sometimes this game is harder then Darksouls, depends on the mood of the Dealer to wether give you that nice blesses or 5 curses in a row with lower max health cards involved.Rebalance issue aside, this game is one of kind and quite a masterpiece at that. If you enjoy Arkham fight style, randomized dungeon, and experimental idea, buy this game. You won't be disappointedOh, and The Dealer's voice is awesome			"

												A narritively driven rougelike with turn based exploration and batman arkham style combat. Take risks and cheat lady luck as you go on an adventure that has an oddly new and yet familiar aspect to it. Are these new memories or perhaps old ones retreaded? Are they even your memories at all?Then, when your luck goes sour all combat takes place in real time using the simple arkham system. Loads of encounters, enemies and equipment. Equipment effects your stats and gives you passive bonuses while you can get activatable weapon skills and artefacts. Cureses and Blessings also effect gameplay in the combat and in the adventure. Plus, its got cards and deckbuilding elements too!Buy it full price, buy it on sale, buy the DLC, its all worth it. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.			"

												Hand of Fate is a very interesting game. It uses cards to convey almost all of it's gameplay and yet it manages to never get boring or repetetive about it. There is also a fairly simplistic combat system that is used during any combat enocounter when going through the game. This system is easily understandable without being blunt, and it suits the game well. A top feature in this game is that you have a say in how the dungeons you explore are generated, through a customizable ""Encounter"" deck. Overall this game is just a lot of fun and if it looks interesting to you, I'd say buy it, It's worth the price.			"

												Picked up this game during a holiday sale and recently returned to play the (free!) updates. I really like the combination of procedural level exploration and hack n' slash combat encounters. Replayability is high due to different game modes which change the rules to match the ""flavor"" of your character. This is a game that I come play a round or two every week when I don't have time to sit down and power through hours of a typical RPG. 8/10			"

												This is a strange little game.  It incorporates elements of cards games, rpg games, and action style games and tries to wield them all together.

The story cards are then mixed together with new cards by the mysterious Dealer and laid out to form a map.  As you move your character onto a story card, it flips over, usually resulting in a choose your own adventure style encounter, although there are also straight up combats and stores to discover.  Any equipment you find is usually drawn from your equipment deck, so what cards you put in that can be important as are what encounters you added into the mix. Some encounter cards come with tokens you can earn by achieving something during the encounter.WIn or lose, once your run is over, any tokens you've earned unlock new eqiupment and encounter cards.  It is no coincidence that some of the most useful cards are rewards for some of the most risky encounters, so going safe is not always good for the long run.Combat is handled with a battle system nearly identical to the Batman Arkham games.

You have attack, combo damage, block,counter, stun, dodge roll, weapon ability, artifact ability.This from an overall perspective is a very unique and fun game, plenty of loot and replayablity, and you gain more options even on failing a run, so your time never feels completely wasted.VERDICT:There's nothing about the game I dislike or feel is badly done, so a full recommendation from me :)			"

												Hand of Fate is a card game.Hand of Fate is an action adventure.Hand of Fate is a board game.All of the above is true and executed remarkably well for a small unknown studio. The trinity of those three games might appear to suggest that Hand of Fate is a casual game. It is not. Actually it is quite hardcore on the higher difficulty levels, which one will need to play at to unlock all cards and events. Don't deprive yourself of 80% of the game by just playing it on easy. It's not just more difficult, the game plays very differently with different ""decks"".The only reason I would not recommend Hand of Fate is because of the RIDICULOUSLY difficult Kraken encounter which has soiled about 95% of my endless mode runs. **** you Kraken. 11/10 would get smashed by tentacles, stabbed by lizard men, eletrocuted, set on fire or chomped on by a Kraken all in one single encounter at the same time again.

YouTube™ Video: Hand of Fate Review 

			Views: 24		

			Link to the Hand of Fate steam page: http://store.steampowered.com/app/266510/ Please tell me what you thought about this game! If you have any feedback for me please let me know! Thanks for watching!		

What this game did well was make a very replayable game with an interesting story that makes you want to keep replaying it. It does this through the side stories in the game. For a lot of cards, when you land on them they will give you a side quest that you can complete. If you do complete it then it will unlock another card that keeps driving this side story into multiple play throughs. This really helps in making the game not stagnate the more you play it, because it is constantly adding new cards for you to interact with and furthering the stories at the same time. On the subject of RNG, this game is not always fair because a lot of it comes down to RNG. Most of the time you can handle what the game throws at you, but sometimes you will have a game where literally nothing goes your way. If you do not enjoy games that have RNG elements like this, then you will probably not enjoy this game. However, I feel like for the most part the RNG is not that bad. The main problem that this game has is the combat. The combat is fairly simplistic, where you mainly just dodge and counter enemy attacks, similar to the Batman Arkham games, but less polished. Something about the combat just isn’t very satisfying. The enemies usually take a good bit of hits before they go down and when they do go down they don’t really have any kind of death animation, they just go full ragdoll which isn’t very gratify. But, this game is still very enjoyable to play and I recommend checking it out.			"

												Hand of Fate is a card game.Hand of Fate is an action adventure.Hand of Fate is a board game.All of the above is true and executed remarkably well for a small unknown studio. The trinity of those three games might appear to suggest that Hand of Fate is a casual game. It is not. Actually it is quite hardcore on the higher difficulty levels, which one will need to play at to unlock all cards and events. Don't deprive yourself of 80% of the game by just playing it on easy. It's not just more difficult, the game plays very differently with different ""decks"".The only reason I would not recommend Hand of Fate is because of the RIDICULOUSLY difficult Kraken encounter which has soiled about 95% of my endless mode runs. **** you Kraken. 11/10 would get smashed by tentacles, stabbed by lizard men, eletrocuted, set on fire or chomped on by a Kraken all in one single encounter at the same time again.

YouTube™ Video: Hand of Fate Review 

			Views: 24		

			Link to the Hand of Fate steam page: http://store.steampowered.com/app/266510/ Please tell me what you thought about this game! If you have any feedback for me please let me know! Thanks for watching!		

What this game did well was make a very replayable game with an interesting story that makes you want to keep replaying it. It does this through the side stories in the game. For a lot of cards, when you land on them they will give you a side quest that you can complete. If you do complete it then it will unlock another card that keeps driving this side story into multiple play throughs. This really helps in making the game not stagnate the more you play it, because it is constantly adding new cards for you to interact with and furthering the stories at the same time. On the subject of RNG, this game is not always fair because a lot of it comes down to RNG. Most of the time you can handle what the game throws at you, but sometimes you will have a game where literally nothing goes your way. If you do not enjoy games that have RNG elements like this, then you will probably not enjoy this game. However, I feel like for the most part the RNG is not that bad. The main problem that this game has is the combat. The combat is fairly simplistic, where you mainly just dodge and counter enemy attacks, similar to the Batman Arkham games, but less polished. Something about the combat just isn’t very satisfying. The enemies usually take a good bit of hits before they go down and when they do go down they don’t really have any kind of death animation, they just go full ragdoll which isn’t very gratify. But, this game is still very enjoyable to play and I recommend checking it out.			"

												It's an OK game. Combat is reptitive, you only mash 3 buttons. No real strategy and it's just chop, counter, roll.			"

												I'll keep this short.Graphics are good, the story teller is great. Gameplay is not that bad.But there is one big, big problem.After a while it just gets boring. You have done every card twice and on other cards you can not progress to get new cards.For the first ten hours, you will have fun. After that... well you will have a whole lot less fun.Buy if you do not mind repitition that much. Because they are random encounters, but you will do all of them, a lot of times.			"

												Hand of Fate is perfect for fans of card games, deck-building, and role-playing games.   Questlines are randomly generated from a mix of cards owned by both you and the dealer.  Playing through the game rewards you with more cards to add into your decks.  While in a quest, you need to manage your health, money, and food.  You will encounter enemies, allies, and obstacles in your quests and they're always presented to you with choices similar to FTL: Faster than Light.  There's also an element of chance that goes along with your decisions.  An example could be that you're walking along a cliff, and you see a sword at the bottom among some bones.  Do you go on your way or try and climb down? If you try to climb down, you then have to watch four cards, with varying degrees of success or failure on them, be shuffled on-screen.  You pick your card and either get injured on your climb down, or succeed and get the sword (which you can then use in combat).  Combat encounters throw you into a room with enemies and the game turns into a simple version of the Arkham Batman games. The fighting is very similar with it's use of blocking, countering, and combos.As of the writing of this review, the game is currently 50% off! It's still worth the purchase at full-price though.

								This is probably one of the coolest games I have played in a long time. Classic D&D style RPG mixed with a trading card game where you actually get to fight the battles in a orcs must die meets god of war hack n slash. The arena, the enemies even your gear all determined by the cards you draw and the deck you've built. Too cool, especially for early access! :)			"

												I'm not sure ""procedural dungeon-crawling arena brawler card game"" is a genre with a lot of entries, but this is probably the best among them. Sadly I can barely run it on my laptop, but I really enjoyed the handful of playthroughs I completed and hope to come back to it after I get some better hardware.			"

												This game is a lot of whimsical, fantasy-based fun that makes my inner board-game junkie happy.The concept of Hand of Fate is awesome on paper, and even cooler when put to work! It's really challenging, it makes you use your brain, it's addicting, and it's just a cool idea!Once you start off, you get the basic set of cards. And as you use those cards and advance through each level, you unlock more cards. Not only does this make you want to keep playing with the mindset of ""Oh man, I gotta use this new card I just got!"" - But it also allows you to unlock better cards you can use to overcome that challenges that come with the harder levels, in a FUN WAY. I'd like to stress that as much as I can - This game takes elements that make other games not fun, and turns it into something that is incredibly fun, in a way that puts other games to shame.I would reccomend, however, using a Gamepad controller for this game. When I played this game on Keyboard + Mouse I found it really confusing and complicated, and didn't have that much fun overall. Once I started using a controller (Steam Controller to be precise) it got a lot better. I wasn't fighting the controls anymore, I didn't have to keep asking myself ""Uhhh, does this button do anything or not? I can't remember..."" and it was a much more relaxing time for me.Also, me and my brother made up a little alternate gamemode where there are two people playing. One person picks the character, the deck, and the level for the other person to play through. So if you've got any friends or family around who wanna play games, there's an option for ya. :P			"

												A great game! Very well thought of game with a mixture of cards and action. This game has good narrative storyline, very polished gameplay, good bgm and sound effects. The game can also be quickly entertaining without having to spend alot of hours into it. It is easy to learn and pickup even with the lack of a subtle tutorial.In general this game allows you finish something like a quest given to you, and you gain a card token. After the end of each session, you open the card tokens revealing new adventures, new equipments that can be added into ur encounter deck, equipment deck and etc. This game is very well thought of because it uses a card interaction of allowing players to create their own encounters with a mixture of the dealers encounter cards. Very interactive gameplay. Players are required to do some sort of resource management from obtaining food resources, consuming food as each step taken requires you to consume one food resource. Sometimes you might think you will not gain anymore food, prompting you to quickly move on to the next level. One downside to this game is that by the time you are 80% completing this game. You realize that there are no new monsters and the background setting are always the same. But it's not a problem because the developers can choose to release new DLC's that feature new monsters and bosses in the near future.Overall, this is a great game that any gamer should add into their collection.

TL:DR--------------------------------Get this game, it's great and unique.Full Review--------------------------------I played a lot of this game on GOG before eventually grabbing it on the Steam sale, and every penny is worth it. The basic premise of the game is that you build a deck of cards that are used to sudo-randomly determine the course of your game, and using these cards you must defeat the Dealer's face cards. (Jacks, Queens, and Kings)There is a HUGE amount of content in the game, and the developers still seem to be adding updates. You can get new weapons and armor and encounters that can be drawn during play to give you an advantage and help you defeat the Dealer's minions.It is highly recommended that you get the Wildcards DLC, as this adds many new options for crafting a new style of play through the course of the game. Well worth the $5.			"

												This game is some kind of wierd amalgation of FTL's rogue-like runs, Batman's free flow combat, D&D's RPG mechanics (and setting... somewhat), as well as a good helping of tarot card and fortune teller theming. The difficulty is fairly easy at first, with the challenge becoming greater as you progress. Those who are at least adequate with the kind of combat described should be able to get right up to the end without too much difficulty, but the last encounter is an absolute nightmare that will take a lot of skill to get past.The game at first is only 16-ish levels long, which can easily take up at least an hour each. The story is very intriquing, delivered mostly through the narration of the dealer, your constant enemy and companion. This, in my opinion, is far more preferable than them just right out telling you everything at the beginning, and the mystic behind the game only fits with the theme of it all. There is also several stories hidden within the cards you will begin to collect as you progress through the game.Initially, I'd say this game is slightly overpriced, with a cost of $20 being more appropriate. However, the developers of the game have started releasing DLC for the game for absolutely nothing, which more than makes this game worth the price. Hand of Fate is a true gem on Steam, with an interesting take on the RPG genre.			"

												Consider this a sort of roguelike. While some people complain about the randomness, that is just silliness. Yes, the cards are laid down at ""random"" on the field, but how you play, which cards you choose (during the ""four-card monty"" choices) and how you handle the challenges is what will determine your success. It's a great, relaxing, fun game. Best game I""ve bought in a while.			"

 Do you want to make your own dungeon? And then complete it? And then fail because you were meant to complete it this time? Well then ... welcome to the RNG heaven and hell Hand of Fate is a mix of roguelike, dungeon-crawler and deckbuilding game. While you play, the dealer will narrate what is happening on the board and you will obey while you fight your way to the dealer. GAMEPLAY  The gameplay in Hand of Fate can be separated in several categories starting with the Deckbuilding ,Card unlocking, ""Dungeons"" , Items, Encounters/Enemies and Combat. Let's get it started.  Deckbuilding Deckbuilding is the neatest of the features I liked in the game because as said it let you make your own Dungeon. While in Endless Mode you dont have deckbuilding because you use all unlocked cards , in Story you have to build your deck, matching the required number of cards for Encounters and Equipment. While you have complete freedom in your Equipment deck, in the Encounters one you will  see locked cards ( one of them is the end boss of the dungeon). Some of the locked cards can be removed by completing them but often leads to new locked cards. Card Unlocking Cards are being unlocked by receiving card tokens. And you receive card tokens when you complete an encounter for first time. And you harvest the rewards at the end of the dungeon ... or after you die( its cool that you arent being punished for dying since a lot of card unlocks can end up terribly for you) . Different cards got different requirments to be completed and gest the best of RNG doesnt mean you will get the token. Once you get to the part where token breaks to reveal cards you will be welcomed with a neat animation. From the token you can get new equipment, encounter cards or gain cards. There are several ""quest"" chains that are worth doing. The newly obtained cards contain no information until you encounter them in-game so you can only guess what may happen. Dungeons Once your deck is ready  the party starts. Dealer will setup the board with separating the different decks in piles and then he starts drawing encounter cards to form dungeon levels. Once everything is setuped you start hoping from card to card till you reach the end... your end or dungeon's end. During story every dungeon comes up with bonus ... curses which will improve your game experience(or make you rage) . Every dungeon in story mode ends up with a boss fight(if you find it before you die) that will unlocks new cards, including the next level. At the end you will unlock new cards(hopefully) and will be able to increase your deck variety. While in the dungeon you have to take care of your supplies: Gold and Food. Food is beiung used on every turn and heals you. Items/Equipment One of your deck is filled with equipment that you can use during your adventures, if you get lucky to find it. You have Weapons,Armored,Gloves,Helmets,Rings, Artifacts(skills) and Blesses/Curses. While you can hoard all the equipments, you can change your active items before fights so you have to be picky and hope for the best. You can have only 1 active item from each category apart from Rings and Blesses/Curses. Encounters can remove any kind of item without blessing/curses(unless its stated otherwise). There are a lot of different items with their own pros and cons. Encounters and Enemies Ah the Encounter Deck, no matter how many good encounters you put in it, there will be always some that will screw everything. There are different kind of Encounters, from straight fights to short text-based adventures. Almost every encounter comes with a lovely RNG that features cards and there are 2 kinds of RNG : Success/failure that are represented with Huge Success,Success,Failure and Huge Failure cards. The amount of cards you can pick is 4 but they depends on the encounter themselves but you always have at least 1 success/failure card and the amount of cards you have to pick from is 4 ; Enemies are also represented by cards . You have the 4 basic enemies Skulls(skeletons), Dust(bandits), Plague(rats) and Scales(Lizardmen) . Each of them got melee and range model which puts the enemy count to 8. While playing you can unlock additional enemies( I got so far Mages, Liches and Lava Golems) which put the enemy count up to 11 . And the Iceing on the cake is the boss cards. Once you beat the boss its being unlocked in the monster deck and with 12 bosses to unlock you put the enemy count up to 23. So enemy variety is quite big for this kind of Game. Combat Last but not least, the Combat. Combat is pretty straightforward. You have Melee attack, Weapon Skill,Artefact Skill, Counter, Stun and Dodge. So you can say that the combat is similiar to Batman or Kingdoms of Amalur but with lower budget. Enemies attack are slowed most of the time so you can react accordingly. If you have shield you can counter melee attacks or reflect projectiles but thats only if the prompt for attack glows green... if its red you better get the f* out of there.  There is a friendlyfire so you can use this to your advantage with good positioning so you can let enemies tank the range attacks. Now.. one thing that I noticed is often so long leaps when you counter enemies at distance or being stuck in animation with no time to react. My main issue with the combat is the camera. You cant rotate it so at times you have no idea what are you gonna face or where exactly the enemy is. Apart from that combat is fine. Story and Narration Story is pretty simple : you are an adventurer who stumbled upon Dealer's home and you are invited for a game but you are free to leave whenever you want. In the said game you have to defeat the Dealer but before that you must defeat his strongest warriors(on every warrior's level you will meet new challenges so GL). Simple yet well presented thanks to the strong Narration. Voice actor did his job superb but there is still something more to be desired from the writing. Still even when Dealer repeats himself is often in the mood of the situation and there are just a view occassions when the line will not be fitting the situation. Difficulty/Fates Now this is more about the DLC ""Wildcards"" . Fates lets you change your playstyle. In base game you have 3 fates that serve as Easy/Normal/Hard difficulty in other games but if you have the DLC you get access to 9 more fates with different stats that affect your playstyle. It's a neat addition but there is still room for improvment. Endless Mode Once you are done with the story, Endless mode seems best option to play it .. but I personally didnt like it since it kills Deckbuilding. In Endless Mode you play with all the unlocked cards you have and on every floor the Dealer gets stronger and stronger. Overall  Its a neat roguelike with forgiving RNG and superb quest design and narration. Its good for short playsession and for people who like to unlock all cards.			"

												tl;dr: good game, but expensive. 8/10I have to give Hand of Fate credit. The presentation and style, as minimal as it is, is impressive. The game itself offers a unique and potentially engaging experience. The mysterious dealer sets the perfect mood with his appearance and narration. The only problem is HoF is one of those style over substance sorts of games. The flow of the game is entirely determined through cards as they're flipped over, and its this.... hand... that determines your fate. (eh? eh? that's the pun in the game's title)Most of the time the game itself never goes beyond making a choice based on the card flipped and then selecting a shuffled card to determine if your action is successful or not. This in of itself isn't bad, but if you're looking for an action-y graphically intense RPG experience with deep lore, you won't find it here.Infrequently, there are action-y bits. Usually in the form of a fight. Sometimes as an obstacle course. They're good place holders and don't do anything particularly wrong, but the AI is typically predictable and easy to overcome if you're a well seasoned gamer even on the harder mode. The action areas are also cramped looking and claustrophobic feeling.Playing off its card based mechanics, the more you play and beat the game, the more and different cards you unlock, and the longer the new games you start become. Longer games translate into higher difficulty. This is one of those games where moves are a resource represented as food. Running out of food typically means you lose HP until you die and starving is typically how you fail in Hand of Fate.Hand of Fate does come together very well though. It works as a game and, most importantly, is enjoyable and fun. The only major complaint I have is there isn't enough content or variety to justify the $25 price IMHO.			"

												I can only agree with the many that this game has certain charm. The cards makes the game and while the combat isn't the best, and it might have served them better not to attempt something similar to the Batman Arkham games, it does fulfill its purpose. So yea, feeling on edge when the dice is rolled and trying to get through a scene makes it feel like a splendid mix of roleplaying, cards and a videogame. So join the fun and buy the game. If the pictures and reviews have caught your interest, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.			"

												I didn't really expect much when I bought this, but it looked intruiging so I gave it a try. And I'm happy I did so, because this game is pretty great. It's not easy to describe. You play cards like in a mixture of a collectible card game and a board game, but it has also RPG-mechanics, a little bit of story, quests, descisions and an action based combat system. At first I thought that the latter was a bit too simple but I gotta admit - it's a lot of fun. Very fast paced, reaction based and dependent on what cards you already got, concerning equipment and abilities. And then there's the dealer of course. And this guy .. he really doesn't want you to win. It's great how he tells you little stories about what's happening and next thing you know, he throws you one of his own cards in your way and all goes to hell. I really, really like this game and I'm looking forward to playing more of it.			"

												I first became aware of this game on WFT is Hand of fate. I loved the art style and the Batman like fighting style. Some people dont really care for the Batman style. Basically its one button to punch and one to block one button to stun and one other button to dogdge. I enjoy this because its easy to understand and easy to pick up on and it looks really good for the most part. The game has a deck of cards and you have a piece that you move around the cards. Differents cards have different stuff inside of them.So for instance a card could contain a weapon of some sort after going down a ravine. The game is very well written and the guy who is the dungeon master looks and sounds great. So for fighting its sometimes one card and sometimes its 2 card with enemies. Sometimes its a boss plus more enemies. However fear not because the game gives you power ups.Via armor and weapons. Some have fire and some have stuns. Also you can get poisin for weapons or stuns or sometimes you can get the knife card that flies in 8 different directions. GOod stuff. I really like the graphics of this game even the fight scene are enjoyable. Watching that slow motion final death blow to an enemy always makes me smile. Even more so if its a boss that  I kill.You can also re arrange the deck or have the computer do it for you. If your wondering how to change the gameplay like I was. Go into the deck building part and click on the middle card and here you can select different cards that can change the game rules its also comes in handy for the dlc. I am playing the monk card right now.So graphics are very sharp looking, sounds are good. My complaints about the game are few. Sometimes you can get a lousy hand and either die because of bad drops or no food. I am halfway done with the game so it seems like it might be a tad short. Maybe around 12 or 15 hours long? Perhaps less it does have an endless mode.Some on the forum have complained of the game being too dark after they switched to the newer unity engine. I have not had this issue and they did roll back the changes but some are still having issues. The fix right now is windowed mode.My only other nit pick is sometimes the traps are a real pain. You fight in rooms and some are small and some are big and loaded with traps. It does hurt the bad guys as well however. So thats fair. I am having a good time with the game and I really enjoy it. One more thing the developers seem to be very active on the forums and seem to care so thats a very good thing.A fun and unique game. Most games  last around 10minutes up to 20 minutes or perhaps a little longer. Not super long. Buy it and you can thank me later.			"

								This game is hard to quantify because it combines many elements. The actuall game play is 3rd person combat much like a dynasty warrios game. The ""dungeons"" are created using a deck of cards and they are random everytime you play. As you progress through the game you unlock new cards which you can then build your ""decks"" from. This includes weapons that can be founf in the dungeon, food, and even new cards that can appear in the next dungeon. Each dungeon has a ""Boss"" that when you defeat unlocks the next in the series.Pros:- Fantastic graphics and style- Great combat controls- Love the card collectionCons:- Traps in 3rd person mode can be a bit distracting and frusterating.

Early Access Review
Short: Hand of Fate is a weird concept that plays out surprisingly well. Very much unfinished and unpolished as of now, but the core concept is well done and people that enjoy games like FTL will probably get some fun out of this too. Fun, but there are caveats.Long:The Good: The strange genre mix plays out surprisingly well, with the ability to influence your dungeon and the RNG parts by careful considerations. The fighting system is heavily influenced by batmans free flow. The voiceover and presentation is atmospheric and the unlock system itself is telling a story. There are many interesting items and effects that keep runs fresh even after failing coupled with the unlocks.The Bad:The combat is at times clunky, sometimes bordering unfair and the camera can get into weird angles. Some items and effects are poorly balanced and the RNG can really screw you over sometimes. The aesthetics are ok, but it's no AAA title of course. Restarting a run does takes 30 seconds because of the presentation, that should really be skippable (and sometimes the token animation). For some token encounters, you have not the slightest clue how to get them.The Ugly:Terrible optimization (as of now): some rooms and angles can make your framerate dip very significantly but it doesn't offer a proper graphics options menu, only presets. Also, for some reason it is a big memory hog (in excess of 2GB).  I was unable to play the combat with KB+mouse as it didn't register the mouse buttons. Works fine with a controller, but that should work anyway. The key rebinding in the launcher is bad, listing controls for 9 gamepads (wtf?) and binding for attacks on KB+mouse didn't work for me.

								Hands of Fate is, usurprisingly, the hidden pearl of the new EC Humble Bundle. Hidden behind the $15 dollar paywall, it's most likely the one game people won't bother paying the extra few bucks to check out. Shame on them.The game is, hands down (ba dum tsh), awesome. For those of you living under a rock and that have never any of the Extra Credits reviews of this game (they actually did it twice), lemme summurize it for ya:The game is a cross between card game, Arkham City arena battles, and choose-your-adventure book. Basically you have a table with face-down cards and a character token that moves through those cards. Each card is an Event card, which can range from ""You have been ambushed by Goblins who took your stuff"" stage, made classic by the Golden Axe games, a maze stage filled with traps, or a plain-text event where you have to use your wits to avoid being on the receiving end of a prostate exam. The It's Toasted of the game is that during combat events the game zooms in and you control your character (with customizable gear!) to fight the hordes of enemies in the aforementioned Arkham City arena battles. It's pretty neat, althought it gets really unfair sometimes as the game has no challenge ballance - if you got dealt a bad hand of cards you're gonna have a bad time. You ""improve"" (as much as adding harder challenges is an improvement) by acquiring cards after beating the dealer's challenges along stages. So no way this is gonna be monetised in the future. Yey!The game is still in Early Access, as of the time of this review the latest patch marks it as Beta1, so there's a lot of unpolished and unfinished things. The dealer has only a couple few animations and sometimes runs out of voice lines, there's not much variation between enemy models, the menu's navigability is horrible, and every now and again you stumble into attrociously unballanced dificulty spikes, but this is all expected from Early Access titles. I highly recommend the game, even in it's current form. One of the best card game concepts I've seen, reminds me a lot of the old Shadowrun TGC game.			"

								Hand of Fate isn't done yet at the time of writing, but it is in beta, and it is pretty close to done. As such, I'm just going to punch out a quick little note about it:This game is actually close to done, unlike most early access titles. If the idea of a roguelike game where you control the things you encounter to some extent, with combat vaguely based on the Arkham series, then this game might interest you. If you don't think that sounds interesting, don't buy it.I would recommend holding off on buying it and playing it until after it is finished, as in its present state it still needs some balancing tweaks, but the core of the game really is there.

												This game has -WAY- more depth than it lets on. To say it's Rogue-Like isn't entirely accurate as it's not 100% random, you construct your own deck with certain restrictions and for every item you add that is in your favor there could potentially be another added by the dealer that can harm you. Suffice to say, this game flew under the radar and it really deserves way more credit than it's given. The fact that the user reviews state that it's overwhelming positive should be enough for you to at least try it and $20 isn't asking much. I generally prefer First Person Shooters as my staple but this is honestly my favorite game of the year second to Evolve.			"

												There's a lot of content in this game. There are tons of items and events to unlock, and there's a lot of good combat. I sank over 41 hours into this game, and most of that was probably grinding for trying to unlock specific cards. But it suffers from a couple serious design flaws.I appreciate the giant random element in the game, but when the difficulty ramps up about 7 bosses in, it makes a very large difficulty spike. Some of the dungeon curse combinations are punishingly difficult.There are cards which are close to impossible to beat unless you beat them early enough in the game. These can include Devil's Wager and The River.Too many of the encounters require you to either have  a ridiculous amount of gold or food, or require you to do a lengthy quest chain to unlock new cards. The random chance issues in some of these later encounters can make them ridiculously difficult to complete.By the end of the game, pain cards can aggregate to the point where you get insta-killed from max HP if you have enough curses. It happens.Do not ever quit the game in the middle of a run. Normally it will save your spot, but if the developers decide to patch the game, it can delete any in-progress runs you have going. The code to prevent that is simply to hard for them to implement, due to poor design choices. Just don't leave runs in-progress, as the developers should not be trusted.The dealer is usually funny, tends to get annoying when he runs out of new things to say and just repeats himself over and over. There were also issues with prejudiced and thoughtless dialogue of his which have since been patched out.The DLC isn't all that expensive, and it unlocks character classes for your protagonist, each which has its own quest chain, but each class has its own benefits and drawbacks. Some of the classes are ridiculously overpowered in certain fields, which kind of makes the DLC ""pay to win"".The graphics and controls are okay, usually. A couple of glitches here and there, and sometimes the controller seems unresponsive until a couple seconds after a battle has begun. That's no good.The developers have an unfortunate habit of ""rebalancing"" cards, moving around their place in the unlock system or difficulty levels they show up on, and completely changing the way the later dungeons work, and not for the better. This is the sort of negative developer behavior that similarly plagued Dark Souls II.The overall experience is marred by a couple of bad design choices.			"

Overall:An Early Access success, its nice to see a game come out of that hell hole and bring something very unique and special to the table. I hope to see this gain some huge publicity and enough sales to bring it to other platforms so that everybody has a chance to play this. Support the devs, buy this game!			"

												This game is amazing in so many ways I cannot describe.It gives you the freedom that you would recieve from open world games to where you can take the role of the Hero, A kind man who gives food to those who need other then worrying about yourself. Returning a well made and powerful weapon of a deceased Hero to his loved ones instead of taking it. Or choose the role of a Greedy-Bandit refusing to give food to hungry starving children. Killing someone crying for help for the small price of gold. The Adventure and Story is your own to decide. As if you were the one actually writing it out in a book and day by day falling head over heels for it because its such a amazing journey and the events that occur cause you to just scream in ""Awe""The items you may find are pretty basic. Though I do admit some of them are quite laughable such as the RAT Cleaver. Which looks like a overgrown Butcher-Knife just waiting to cut down one of the pests you see moving around the Kitchen.The Characters are the same as you would see in any other MMO/RPG type game. Though the design is quite cool. Especially the Mages! The Bosses however are quite unique, Though they do have the predictable look as their name dictates such as ""Jack of Dust"" Who is the boss of a Group of Bandits referred to within the game as Dusts, Looks like Typical Bandana wearing Bandit with no shirt and Tattoos. Though I was always excited to fight a new one.This game is a thrill for people who love adventure! Cards! Battles! And even Bragging rights at times after going past 100 Floors. :P			"

												Interesting concept, fun at first, then falls flat fast.  Too many times encounters give you a 25% chance to succeed and when the cards are shuffled more than once it's impossible to follow a success card, so it's really blind luck to pass/succeed.  I like being in control of my game, not win by sheer random chance.  I forget the card, pay 3 gold for your future to be told, 25% chance to succeed, failed it several times in a row because it's just blind luck if you succeed.  Silly.  Too many times I'm in fights with traps, missile weapons, and 6+ mobs...and I've yet to have a chance to upgrade my weapon.  This game reminds me of Darkest Dungeon(though not to the same extreme) where the devs thinks it cool/fun to keep heaping on bad luck and misery onto the player and expect them to enjoy it and have fun.  Newsflash devs, constantly giving the play bad things and misery isn't fun unless it's balanced by good things also happening as often.  Lastly, combat in this game is simplistic as best...pure console game button mashing junk.			"

								A very intriguing game with solid (though not revolutionary) arena-style fighting, but with a groundbreaking kicker: it's all in the cards.It would be interesting just to have a deck for the player, but the opponent also has a deck that makes the encounters randomized and unique. Earning cards by completing challenges helps to stack your own deck helps to maximize your fortunes. There is some chance involved with some encounters, adding to the randomness and dynamic nature of each rouguelike run.I usually don't endorse early access, but this game seems to be heading in the right direction. I wouldn't blame some for waiting for the final release, but it's already very polished and enticing, and I'm having a blast playing it.			"

												I haven't written a review for this game yet? Whaaat. Well, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥in' great. Very hard to nail down exactly how it plays, as you might imagine, but let's say it's a card-driven, sorta 80s/90s board game-styled, randomly generated action-adventure game... with combat strongly inspired by the Arkham batman titles. Recent patches and expansion content (some of it free!) have further built upon this very strong foundation by adding new cards of all types, and introducing entirely new difficulties and game modes.If the images on the store page, and this recommendation, at all intrigue you, I'd strongly suggest taking the game for a spin. If by some unlikely chance you don't like it, there's always the refund option. But you won't need to because it's radical.			"

								So far, I love it. It's like a mix of Hearthstone, Dungeons and Dragons and Arkham Asylum - it's dark and mysterious with beautiful art and briliant character designs. Definitley going to be one of my favourites - you can also thank Jesse Cox for bringing this to my attention (and I'm so glad he did). I would honestly recommend this to everyone! I can't wait for more bug fixes/updates - I know it will just make the whole experience even more fun!			"

												[Edit to reflect new content and improvements in gameplay:I first reviewed this game in 2015, then stopped playing it because of problems with my PC which have since then been fixed. Recently started playing again, and I've been finding it even more entertaining than it was before. Since my initial experience the developers have added a bunch of new content, made some adjustments to the old cards, as well as improvements in the combat-system. And I swear the Dealer is even more amusing than he was before. I've missed his particular brand of snark.Go.Buy.WIN!]To say this game is ingenious would possibly be the understatement of the year.If this game were a woman, I would want her as my girlfriend, and I would stroll with her through the town square and feel my chest swell with immense pride and pleasure at the envying glances of others. I would thank the grace of fortune for having stumbled upon her and won her to my side. She'd be a woman of elegant beauty and subtle wit, possessed of a personality combining old-school sensibilities with modern flair. She'd be open to endless possibilities of adventure, unpredictable in her actions but kind enough to warn me ahead of time as to what she might have planned for me, allowing me time to prepare myself accordingly. Sure, she might try to knife me in the back from time to time, but she'd also have a fondness for surprising me with mind-blowing wakeup sex. Even after time bred more familiarity with her mercurial nature, I'd still find her to be a walking Wand of Wonder, and every day with her would be an awesome exercise of ""What's Next?""She'd be the girl next door and the Devil in a blue dress rolled into one, and just how far she let me into her heart would all depend upon how well I played my cards (Well, and beat down the Raving Packs of Jealous Suitors who woud occasionally camp out in the front-yard, but hey. Details!).TL;DR? : Maud'dib, We have fun-sign the likes of which GOD has never seen.			"

One of those games you can just pick up and play any time and it saves after each encounter which is nice, so you can pick up from where you left off.			"

								Fantastic game, particularly if you enjoy card games or choose-your-own adventure gameplay. The random elements ensure each playthrough feels fresh, and it can be challenging to collect the elements you need to beat each boss unless you're skilled at the combat, which makes the game never feel too easy. If you like random elements, collecting, RPGs, or rhythm-based combat, I can't recommend getting this game enough. This was the only game so far I've decided to get in early access and I don't regret my purchase one bit.			"

								Part card game, part board game (at least, as far as the exploration/reveal encounters goes), part CCG, part 3rd person hack and slash action game, all mixed together rather well.The game is presented as a card game of life and death between you and a mysterious (He's a guy that lives in a ""cabin at the end of the world"" and I don't think he properly introduced himself. Rude host.) hooded...man. Death? Fate? Whoever he is, he is your guide and your foe and you must make your way through his trials and underlings before you are allowed to fight him. As he deals the cards every round, his mannerisms and the way he talks remind me of .. well, a weird and dangerous tarot reading. Which I like.If you like CCGs and board games and hack and slash RPG/roguelikes and want them all in one package, then this is definitely the game for you. Really if you like any combination of the above (unless you HATE hack and slash games...then I can't in good faith recommend this to you), then this game is worth a look and most likely a buy.			"

Early Access Review
								Recomended, but a Roguelike, this isn't.  Theres a common notion that roguelike = perma-death.  And while Hand of Fate is merciless in this regard, the defining characteristic of a roguelike is randomness and replayability; a variable experience in every new game.  It is ironic that Defiant would choose to name this title Hand of ""Fate"" as there is limited variability in the ""Hand"" your dealt, at least in the first several levels I've played.  The game bills itself as a deckbuilder, indicating a level of tactical cunning is required to defeat the game.  In my time with the game, the key to victory seems to have nothing to do with cards or fate, but your ability to succeed in the action phase of the game.  More of a button mashing twitchfest than the card game I was hoping for, Hand of Fate would be best played with a console remote, feeling more like a God of War inspired beater than a Deckbuilder.  Being a early access title, the game is lacking any upfront system options, but atleast you can access them by holding shift when launching the game.  The voice acting and graphics are excellent, so hopefully Defiant will continue to enhance the core game to match the potential of the AV experience.			"

It is rather well balanced even though it is still an early access game. Plus it is oozing with atmosphere. Highly recommend you try it.""10/10Possibley one of the best thought out, and designed games I have played in the last decade or so.			"

												If you don't have a controller don't buy this game. The targeting is finnicky enough with Analog, I can't imagine using WASD.I'm struggling as to whether or not I should recommend this game, and I don't think I can. The game starts out really fun, and it stays fun for quite a few runs. I've almost beaten it at four hours, and I don't know if I will end up finishing it. The Endless Mode sounds like it could be pretty fun with the right deck, but after starving to death on the last tile of the game thanks to an awful combination of curses and cards, as well as all the other BS this game has thrown at me, I just couldn't play it anymore.As I said, the game starts out really fun, and it stays fun for quite a few runs. Then you start running into the problems.The combat is really easy for anyone that's played an Arkham game. That is, when the game actually lets you do well in combat. Combat features a fixed camera, and incredibly small arenas with (as far as I've seen) at most 10 enemies. It also doesn't let you interrupt your attacks, which causes you to not be able to dodge. Combat also has a targeting problem, so occasionally you'll hit the wrong enemy. The power attacks that some enemies do are unblockable, and uninterruptible, which will cause you to get hit when you face one of the bosses for the twentieth time. Unless I missed it, the game also doesn't explain how to do finishers on enemies. As for the difficulty, in the early levels its easy, and in the later levels it just feels unfair. Don't bother trying to increase the difficulty before you get all your food upgrades though, because if you do you'll run out of food and probably end up starving to death.I will say I really enjoyed the different gear you could get.The card part about it was really good. I really enjoy that aspect of the game, and how you can choose which cards you'll be finding. Some of the cards however, are incredibly annoying, and basically only worth it to unlock whatever the card unlocks. Also some of the special cards, basically stories told through a couple cards, like The White Minotaur, or the Kraken, they were cool, but you're not gauranteed to find them during a run. That's fine I guess, it was a bit annoying not finding them, because I really liked them, but that's just the type of game it is. My problem with them, is that at a certain point, you have to find them, then roll the dice on whether or not you'll actually get to move on. I was doing one of them, spent 6 turns walking between cards, and then ended up failing because I got unlucky. This was with a blessing that let me reroll my successes and failures as well.Also the Ratmen. The Ratmen are the worst enemies in this game. They will end your combo because you killed them. Why does this happen? Because they leave a cloud of gas that will damage you over time, and you'll end up running over it at least once thanks to the usually small arenas. They also have a ranged enemy that throws 1-4 knives at you very quickly.Maybe I'll change this review to be a recommendation later, but as of now it just gets too frustrating for me to recommend.

												***DO NOT EXPECT TO EVER FINISH THIS GAME. STACKING PENALTIES, MULTIPLE BOSSES AT THE SAME TIME AND DECK-STACKING ARE ALWAYS AGAINST YOU***An excellent mash-up of deck building, card-progression/upgrades through success, and timing-based combat. You find yourself in a Plutonian hall before the Dealer, the Game Master of a card game that reflects your life and memories. Will you donate blood to a vampire? Save a maiden while you are severely outnumbered? Break open sand-buried tombs for a chance at treasure or curses? It was your life, what memories of yours do the cards hold?This rogue-like combines card game with random chance, mini-games with careful preparation, and mystery with thirsty curiosity. You WILL be tested.You WILL smash your keyboard at the unfairness of the decks and bosses.You WILL face those bosses again, as they are added to the chance encounter deck as soon as they are beaten......and you will come back for more. Again and again you will be rebuffed, and again and again you will come crawling back to unlock more powerful cards, win at games of chance and squeeze all the efficiency out of your food (movement) and gold (money) as you can.Thirteen Challenges await. The further you progress the smaller the arenas get, the tougher and more numerous the enemies get, and the more unfair the Dealer stacks the deck against you. What's your threshold for pain? I hope it's high. This game is gorgeous in it's own mystery and difficulty.			"

You have (unskipable cinematic) to watch the guy deals cards again, then go through the first floor, again, to get basic supplies, again. Rock falling is only one level right? Yeah, the next is:ANGRY MOB wants your food. ANGRY MOB wants your food. ANGRY MOB wants your food... You starved. Fighting is easy (normal mode). The concept is nice, the assets are here, the tutorial and gradual introduction of concepts well done. A weird idea to keep the player encounter events just to get decent gear. The random outcomes pilled on top of each other with no save or fast-forward makes it frustrating.			"

												I dont think this game is for everyone, though i would still not say that it is for a very specific audience. Set up as a board game where you go in and out of combat sequences you make your way through a maze of random cards containing different events where a combinations of your decisions and chance determines if you get new gear, supplies, gold, or health or if you are stripped of these things. Although my genereal experience of the game is positive, there are things that are lacking, especially the combat, seeing how this is a large part of the game, it drags down the experience quite a bit. Hand of Fate is using a very weak incarnation of the arkham mechanics in battles, a system that I didn't personally even enjoy in the batman games. The criticisms of the arkham system are not hard to find on the internet but to me it seems to be little more than a dynamic quicktime event ""Press q when green stuff is flashing, press space when red stuff is flashing"". Although some things are thrown into the mix to spice the combat up, such as traps and aoe effects, such a weak system needs alot more to make it interesting.I still recommend this game, the gathering of cards is still interesting and the decition making still keeps me intrigued.

								This game is hard to explain as its unlike any type of game I've played before and I don't think you can really really give it a defining genre. I didn't really know what to expect from Hand of Fate but was really pleased with my purchase. The game covers a lot of different game genres in a simple but polished way so I think anyone can get something out of it. The only thing that I can think of as a con for the game is that you cant create your own avatar, but some people might not mind this. I'd like to see Hand of Fate develop into a much larger scenario with more cards for a more versatile deck which would encourage different approaches to the game.			"

												Beautiful aesthetic with solid gameplay to back all that up. The idea of an adventure which depends on the card which you are dealt by the well designed shady dealer is fantastically executed. You have just enough control over the situiation with the deck you construct but can still be surprised by the dealer. On top of that there is tons of DLC which the developers released for free , which is a commendable gesture to the early backers. Do your own research and then decide if you want this game , overall for me it was and still is an enjoyable expreience.			"

												I was really excited to play this game, but the more I play, the more it feels like a chore to play.I'll cut all the crap and get to why I don't think this game is worth it1. The combat sucks. It's a much lesser version of the Arkham style of combat. The problem with it though is that it's terribly imbalanced. Enemies love their ranged attacks, so when you're in a fight with 5+ enemies, you're constantly dodging or countering ranged attacks. Even when you can counter ranged attacks, it seems to do almost zero damage to enemies and they never die to their own arrows. Meanwhile, you're getting pounded on by 3 enemies, and you end up getting hit anyway because you can't counter the melee and ranged at the same time. So you try to dodge. And something manages to hit you while you're dodging. And things take forever to die if you didn't find a good weapon. As simple as the combat is, it's frustrating and not fun.2. The randomness. I know it's a card game, and that's something that piqued my interest in the game, but it's too much against your favor. To unlock new cards, you have to meet prerequisites, and more often than not, you're not going to have them. But there's nothing you can do to meet them, because everything is chance. But all you want to do is unlock new cards. It's just luck. And the cards don't reward you enough. My last 3 runs were against the skeleton king, and all 3 times, I ran out of food near the end. You can only get food by chance or by buying it at randomly placed shops, but you get gold to buy things randomly and none of my cards ever gave me any gold to buy food. I never felt like my losses were my fault.And those two faults are what make up the entire game. You only do two things: go through RNG cards and see what the results are, and fight. The RNG results aren't satisfying, and the combat isn't satisfying, so there's no sense of accomplishment. I'm really sad I don't like this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Really interesting game.  The combat is very easy to learn and has all the basic mainstays you'd expect from a fighting game.The highlight is definitely the dealer and the world of cards he builds.  Both mentor and adversary, it's like having a pocket dungeon master when you feel like going it alone.			"

												An excellent sit-back-and-chill game.  Fully controller supported.  A little action, a lotta optioning.  What makes this game though is the narrator, who basically serves as your opponent.  His varied commentary and hints at the larger picture do an excellent job of keeping you going.If you're looking for something that's more about seeing what comes next and less about jamming X to win (though there's a bit of that, need some action to keep you invested), this is definitely worth checking out.

												Concept is great. Most of the game play is very good. Not much in the way of tutorials, so mistakes in the early game are bound to be made and those can be costly; such as cant go back thru doors, stairs, etc... Deck building isn't explained either, so you will need to go to outside sources for the basics. The combat controls are slow to respond, such that if an enemy gets a hit on you, you will get one or two more as your dodge will not be recognized. So with heavy doubts I am recommending this game, but with great caveats.			"

												A brand new concept for RPG's combined with a combat system polished enough to achieve what it wants... I have no bad words for this game. Well, I haven't played enough of it to know how it is later on, but for the rate of complexity the game gains so far, it has potential to be one of the greatest games of this year.			"

								Even in early access this game is great. It's super fun and addicting. You'll find yourself playing it again and again to try to unlock new paths and advance in the game. Some things are still unbalanced and there are bugs, but that is part of the early access experience. This is a game with amazing potential and I recommend picking it up!			"

												I bought this after watching a totalbiscuts video he did on it, i thought it looked fun and different and that is exactly what it is. The gameplay is addictive and varied, the narrator is amazing, the way he taunts and mocks you as you ""play"" is fantastic, well worth the price of admission! If your considering picking this up definatly do it, i know the year has just begun but Hand of Fate is the best new game ive played this year so far! "

												Alrighty, I've been playing this game for quite a while, and it's been a treat watching it develop towards launch. Now that the time is finally here, I'll try to break down what makes this game such a gem.The premise of the game is simple; you, the player, are in a tabletop game against some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wizard called The Dealer. That may seem harsh, but, trust me, you'll hate this guy by the time you finish story mode. He's a card sharp and a cheat, and he quite shamelessly weights the deck against you at every turn. This becomes particularly apparent towards the endgame, where you can die on the first board due to the insane limitations he can put on you in terms of both combat and curses. That doesn't make him a bad character, however. The Dealer is quite effective as an antagonist, and his growing desperation as you (whom he implies to be a meathead jock adventurer) mow down his court is somewhat reminiscent of a DM growing exasperated with a party that refuses to die.The nature of the game is a Shoggoth monstrosity that can shift its genre at will between choose-your-own-adventure, Arkham-style brawling, tabletop RPG, and roguelike. To be honest, I could spend hours trying (and failing) to describe it in any decent fashion. Watch a video of it. Jim Sterling's Squirty Play is a good one; it's the release version, and you get to see the reaction of someone who: a) has had no exposure to it, and b) was expecting something very different.Basically, what makes this game great isn't really the gameplay; the individual parts of it are rather bland. By itself, the combat would be mindlessly dull. By itself, the board game would be ridiculously unfair. By himself, the Dealer would still be a jerk. It's the smooth integration of all the facets of this game that make it such an amazing catch. I'm not sure it will ever be considered a ""great"" (although one can hope), but it certainly has all the markings of a cult classic.Pros:+Very simple and effective gameplay+Good voice acting (although it IS only the one voice)+Lack of backstory allows the player's imagination to do its thing+Although the individual sections of gameplay aren't unique, the combination certainly is+Will shamelessly kill you without truly punishing you+Doesn't interrupt gameplay; even on death, you can immediately jump back in+Endless mode is pretty entertaining+No ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crafting systemsCons:-Combat can be a tad wonky-The optimization is quite iffy; it will tank your CPU for no apparent reason sometimes. Seems to occur more prominently later in the game. This'll probably be fixed (and it's ALOT better than it used to be), but it should be noted.Niggles:~It feels like some of the event triggers are a tad insane, particularly the ones with multiple RNG draws. I still haven't completed the River encounter.~You can wind up in positions that can break the game in your favor; I've had more than 1k health at one point due to a bit of RNG luck after finding the Ring of Poverty.~Flame golems are ridiculous. They take a lot of hurtin' and they dish out even more. When they show up in multi-monster encounters, it usually means a wipe.~The Dealer is an incorrigible cheat. No really, he's a prick.I'd give it a hearty thumbs up. Buy it.			"

												This game brings something new to the table that I think many people will enjoy. There are aspects of strategy, roguelike, deck building, and hack n slash. It is assembled with very appealing visuals and executes its unique style very well.While playing there were definetly qualities that established it in my mind as similar to classic choose-your-own-adventure games, and aspects of DnD. The set up of ""randomized"" events set up on uniquely simulated dungeon maps and illustrated through card play is spot on.This is also one of the few games that is absolutely delightful when played in endless mode. It is almost as if the developer started out crafting a game based on endless mode, and put a well made story mode in to pull it all together.That combined with the just-long-enough, but making-me-beg-for-more, pacing of the main game makes for an excellent experience.In game dialogue between the dealer and player regarding events, bosses, successes, and failures just brings the whole experience home and puts it up among my top favorite games.I love this game so far, and can't wait to see what they produce with DLC.I highly recommend this game.9/10			"

								Wow- pretty amazing game. It's a cross between Talisman (the board game), Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, and Diablo, and it integrates all of those into a consistently fun whole. I have found myself willing to fight a hard battle before the boss (even knowing I will die at the boss if I do) because I will get a card to add to my deck. The decisions create tension. Even the luck elements - of which there are many - feel different than a die roll because you get to choose. Yes, it's still the exact same amount of randomness, but it somehow feels like ""If I had only chose that one...I was going to choose that one...""The negatives:1) Luck can be a harsh mistress2) On my very middle-of-the-road system, the frame rate drops on complex battles to where it's almost a guaranteed fail3) I had to go get a controller - the mouse and keyboard were just too clunkyThe positives:1) The dungeon master's voice. I usually get annoyed by voice acting, but this is masterful. 2) In story mode, even though it's roguey, it still feels like a story3) Fantastic mash-up of different types of gameplay - the ability to pick the encounters I'm going to face and the range of equipment I'll have access to is brilliant. 4) The arkham-style combat is fun, and as frustrating as it is to have goblins steal your shield (which makes counters and blocks unavailable), it emphasizes that these are not just multiple game modes strung together, but multiple facets of a single experience.Even though I've died a lot, I have almost always earned something, and I've always wanted to continue. I tend to have a low frustration tolerance these days, but the thought of ""having"" to play a level again just doesn't bother me. Excellent game.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm not much of a reviewer but, I'll sumarise this game as best as i can. And I hope this review will help to support this game.This game is what i would call a story telling rogue-like/lite adventure rpg card game with the Arkham Style fighting system. Seem like alot to put into game but it works well.In this game you must traverse the card layed out by the card dealer. The cards are semi- randomised but, I'll go into more detail later. You click on the card adjacent to where you current position is and then experience the story behind that card which results in either a fight, a choice, a lucky dip or any combination of the three. Then eventually reach the end of the level.CombatThe combat in the game seems to be solid for the most part. The way you fight is simillar if not the same to Batman games style of combat. You move with ""wasd"", ""space bar"" to roll/dodge,""q"" to counter, ""left click"" to attack and ""right click"" to stun. There are also ranged units which can be blocked by your shield. Unless they have a rifle in which case you have to dodge. With as much as I have played so far, the combat seems to be solid, it's not as smooth as it could be and seems a bit jittery, but nothing too extreme. There are also ranged units which can be blocked by your shield. Unless they have a rifle in which case you have to dodge. I have had no problems with the combat so far.BossesThe bosses seem to have a bit of variation. Their mechanics are different depending on their species and the amount and way they attack differ from one to another. There are 12 bosses and so far i have beaten 3, fought 4 as of initially typing this. I have yet to face the later on bosses so unfortunetly I have no experience against them to share as of yet. But, you can still tell when you are in a boss fight and you feel satisfyed to win against them.EnemiesThere are 4 mains enemies you face against, Dust - Bandits, Skull - Skellingtons, Lizard and another which i have yet to encounter. They each are weak to a diffent thing which makes you fights easier or harder depending on the elements of your gear. There are other enemies such as golbins and rats which you face against from their specific event but they all got their own gimic to. Rats will leave a poisonous cloud, goblins will steal your items and won't fight back but will instead try to escaps, so on, so forth.CardsI huge mechanic in this game is the cards. The cards you get in the events you play depend upon the cards you use to build your deck. You get two decks, equipment and events. You unlock more cards through completing events. The cards you unlock are set so it's not all randomised. However, the cards dealer throughs in a couple of his own cards to teach you more mechanics about the game such as enemy types and to prevent you from picking cards which give you a load of free stuff.DifficultyWhen you start off the game, it start off at a beginers pace, to allow you to get use to the controls. It then steadily escilates in difficulty so you are more reliant on your skill and cards you pick. I personally think that the game scales well in difficulty, but you also affect it by the cards you choose. Exsample - If you choose all fights cards, then you could get good loots, but at the same time loose alot of health. If you choose alot of simple equip events, then you will be stuck with low level stuff against the boss. Finding balance is crucial.My OpinionI personally think this game is well made. It plays quite well and the combination and implementation of all the mechanics are great. I would recomend this to people who enjoy rogue-like and/or RPG games with similar combat systems. Regardless of the fact that this game is in early acess at the time of this review, I think if it was released how it is, it would be well worth the price.I would give this game a 8/10 - If you wanna find gameplay of this game, looks at Jessie Cox's Video for fan friday.I haven't played the endless game mode yet so i can not say how good it is, but regardless, it is well worth the price and a ton of fun.I hope this review helps and this is my first review so sorry for any mistakes. This is my opinion of the game, I am not a critic but i decided to write this as i saw there were no reviews. I hope this helps!			"

								Excellent card game, mixed in with real-time combat.It's funny, the style of it I always thought would suit a card game quite well. Your character collects armour and weapons and items but when you go into combat, its all equipped in a real-time action sequence.Really great.			"

								Pretty good balance between combat and deck building. Bought in the Bumble Bundle and got a foil card drop from it so it essentially cost me nothing! I'm really enjoying it so would recommend. Pros: I like the fact that at the end of each chapter the game will re-build your deck for you with the optimium cards. For those that don't particularly want to build their own decks it means they don't get left behind.For the pick a card shuffle rounds I really like the fact that you can actually follow the cards - I've played too many games where it's just randomised but here it's pretty simple to pay attention!Cons: The direction keys aren't too fantastic, I find that I need to let go completely to move in a new direction as I get stuck, it doesn't flow so well but it's not that big a deal as it isn't enough of a handicap to get you killed. Tip: Don't even bother trying to remove the curses, it's not worth the gold. Good weapons and lots of food is far more valuable. From the strange looking maiden I always go for blessings, you generally get something pretty decent and long lasting - there are plenty of other places to get gold, food and life.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a very pleasent suprise. It's randomly generated dungeon board game. It's also a solid roguelike action rpg. Lastly it's a strategic card game. You unlock cards to build a deck that that you randomly draw from during each game. Unlocking cards feels reawrding since you get to 'load your deck' with them later. If you get bored with table top games, or hate having to start your character over, then this game isn't for you. If you dislike the combat in the Batman Arkham games then you should stear clear. The combat has some actual depth with a dodge/counter/block system. It's pretty easy to view the combat as a button smashing action rpg, but you'll get your butt kicked pretty fast if you do that. It's not my favorite part, but taking time, planning out the order of your attacks, and being ready to counter is key to victory.I give this game 8/10+Original, refreshing+Addicting, FTL style+Feels like a good tabletop game-Combat could be flashier-Lacks a storyPlay if you like:Munchkins (tabletop), Dominion (tabletop), Magic the Gathering (tabletop), FTL, Fable, or Dark Souls.

								Hand of Fate is slightly more humiliating a lot more fun than playing a children's card game.It's a very special blend of hack and slay, card game and tabletop--and it's all very stylish. Forget leveling up and hunting for the ultimate loot au Diablo 3: There are no levels to gain, and you always start with a crappy weapon. You want a better one, you have to earn it; you can only find/buy equipment whose cards are in play so as you unlock new cards, you get to influence the type of gear you can find, and also to some extent what can happen to you.As of now, the beta (early access) looks and plays nice--apart from the occasional out-of-sync sound effects, everything looks and feels very much worth the $$$. It will be interesting to see if it has any replay value though.Did I mention that it runs on Linux, and flawlessly at that?One thing though: Multiplayer. No, I don't know how that would work. Actually, scratch that, that's a stupid idea.			"

The overarching card-game is interesting, with a large variety in cards with unique effects, and it integrates well with the actual combat. Great sense of atmosphere, with good writing and voice acting for the shadowy dealer. The combat engine could use some polish, but I'm confident that will be address, as the game does appear to be in truly active development for the Early Access period (launch is scheduled for next January).

												Okay, so this game's concept is EPIC. It really is. I don't have many hours on it, but I had to give a review early on because of how this game was conceptualized. But. . .  I can't recommend this game at its regular price, but for the sale price of $7.49 - you better believe it's worth it. I'd say the most this game should ever cost is 14.99 with 4.99 (big) DLCs in the future. Why would I not recommend a game I'm recommending? Because for $24.99, this game should be a lot more. For that, let me list some pros/cons.ProsOriginal Concept - There really isn't another game out there like this one. It ties small elements of rogue-likes, D&D, DD card games, C card games, RPGs, and ARPGs into a sweet-looking, auditorily-pleasing game of chance and skill.Visually appealing - This game looks great, it really does. It's not going to make you think you're sitting across from some gypsy, but you are certainly going to be satisfied with the overall graphics of the game. Auditorily appealing - Most games make me want to turn the background music all the way down, but this game really hits the ambience with its music, voice-acting, and sound effects.Choice of short/long games - if you want to just hop in and play for a bit, you're able to do just that. The game-plays are relatively short (15-30m) and are very easy to pick back up again.ConsLong Animations - The animations (card dealing, turning, token selection) are nice the first two (maybe three) times but they get very old after awhile. The cutscenes leading into normal battles and shops can be skipped, but the boss cutscenes and all other card dealing animations cannot be. This really draws out the game unnecessarily.Hidden Cards from Tokens - As you play to defeat each boss, you will obtain tokens, unlocking other cards. The animations used to present the new cards to you drags on forever, but is pointless given that you have no clue what the cards do until you actually use and play them in a round.This goes for ALL cards. This is a major annoyance for me, because after you defeat the boss, flipping all the cards takes awhile . . .  It is for naught because you still have no idea what the new cards are for, which makes deck building (as you progress the first go-round) pointless.Combat - I have to give combat a 'negative' score because it's very repetitive and not very seamless. I think the 'matrix-style' finishers are pretty epic, but even those get buggy from time-to-time. There needs to be a little more room in each 'arena'. They should also add move combinations (perhaps as 'blessings' or attached to the weapon itself). An example:- you can perform a certain maneuver by hitting: x,x,y,z (just example) - but the computer could swap these keys around, making the combos always different each playthrough. At any rate, the combat is definitely not a 'winner'. Luck v Skill - This game relies on luck over skill far too much. It would be one thing if players were given a chance to win in every  playthrough, but they aren't - if you're dealt a bad hand, then that's just tough, because you're going to probably die and you'll have to start over again. Having a bit of luck dictate parts of the outcome (or the difficulty of achieving a goal) is one thing, but having that be the sole determinant over winning/losing is not okay and it takes the fun out of the game and simply adds a component of frustration.SummaryI really love the concept. We don't see concepts like this come along very often to where it's just a completely new game type all on its own - an innovative game that sparks the next 1k dev teams to copy its game-type.This game took parts of various games and, like a gourmet dinner, made all the flavors work together quite well. Unfortunately, the game relies too much on luck. That's its major flaw. That's the overcooked protein in this dish. If they could fix that, and make the combat a little more 'skill-reliant', then this game would find itself being copied by the next 1k dev teams. Until then, it's only worth about 14.99 (and that's stretching it). So, if you can get it on sale, GET IT! If you are being asked to pay $24.99 for the game - don't. . . because it's simply not worth it at this time.			"

												Alot of people talk about Rogue-likes as these hard-core, unforgiving, all-or-nothing, RNG dependant dungeon crawls... and many of them are. However, if you've played the original Rogue (or Rogue Legacy), you'll find that many game designers who classify their game as a ""Rogue-like"" have only copied the most sadistic parts of that game and ignored some of the more interesting and rewarding parts. Hand of Fate manages to replicate some of the progression aspects that the original Rogue utilized that made me actually love that game and reconsider the ""Rogue-like"" genre entirely. Hand of Fate, like Rogue, is not all-or-nothing. Rather it's a game of incrimental progress. You fight your way as far as you can, gathering tokens (think, card booster packs) along the way, and apon reaching a reset condition (either beating a boss in storymode or dying), those tokens reveal and add weapons, encounters, or armor to your deck which you can then use to enhance your next experiance. That way, you don't feel like you're bashing your head against a wall of RNG spite. In almost every playthrough of Hand of Fate, you're going to come away with something you can add to your deck to slant the odds ever-so-slightly more in your favor, and that's a motivator to keep on playing.As for Hand of Fate's drawbacks? I'd have to say it's combat leaves alot to be deisred. It's a watered down counter-system ala Batman Arkham Asylum that offers very little in terms of variety, fluidity or technique. You occationally get abilities to use and dodges to execute but that doesn't save the whole engagment from being awkward. If there were ever a Hand of Fate 2, (which I'd certainly hope for,) I'd say the combat stands to benefit the most from a reassessment.  "

												This game came up in my recommendations list with a lot of positive reviews and looked interesting so I gave it a shot.  Very glad I did, this game is really good.It's a deck builder - a card game where you gain more, better cards to add to your deck as you progress through the game.  You sit at a table facing a hooded mage who controls the cards and narrated the story.  The voice acting is very good and once you have drawn the same card a couple of times the narration for that card is muted so you don't end up running through the same dialoque game after game.  It's kind of like playing a single player RPG with the mage as DM expanding the story around the cards drawn.  The voice (and the image of the DM to a degree) put me in mind of John Hurt which is cool.The DM deals out a number of cards in a pattern depicting the path (or paths) you have to travel before meeting the final enemy.  You can choose which way to go by which cards you turn over on the path (although some are straight so no choice) and you can be lucky and find the exit to the next level quickly meaning you can skip forward but possibly miss out on finding a shop or other useful encounter.  I prefer to take my chances of drawing a bad encounter for the benefits of potentially better equipment/more cards.The decks consist of armour, weapons, enchantments and food as well as enounters both good and bad.  Some enounters involve a test of luck where you have to choose a 'success' card from a selection of four cards.  These are displayed before being shuffled so there is a chance you can follow the best card before they are dealt face down.  Winning encounters let you draw cards from your deck giving you the chance to upgrade your armour, weapons or giving you more food (needed to heal)It's not just a static card game however.  The battles are actually played out as a third person skirmish with you controlling your character fighting, blocking and using any special abilities granted by your equipment.  This is the part that really marks the game out as different and deepens your sense of involvement - you're not just sat at a table playing cards, you are truly part of the story which is unfolding.Completing the final enemy grants you additional cards for your deck and every fourth quest grants you an item from the DM levelling up both your character and the enemies you will face.If you are unfamiliar with deckbuilding or just want to progress to the next game quickly, at the start of each quest you have the option of using a recommended deck based on y0our cards.  If you wish, you can then go in and edit the deck to your satisfaction although newly gained cards will not reveal their effects until they have been played.There is the skill of choosing which cards you own will be best suited to the upcoming quest.  This gets more important the further you progress and the more cards you have.Overall, a very enjoyable and quite relaxing game, definitely worth the money.			"

Fun. Straightforward. Atmospheric. Pick up and play. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to play a card game against a mysterious wizard, then this is the game for you. Just by sitting at a table to play cards against this man, the game does a wonderful job at world building. It creates the impression you're in some sort of Arabian Nights tale, or perhaps one of the Call of Cthulhu back stories. Either way, I was quickly sucked in.All the card game's rules are handled by your wizard friend, who is both your opponent and your friendly dealer. The learning process for this game was quick. The tutorial is a natural part of the game and a natural part of story progression, which I thought was well done.+ The Game ItselfThe wizard lays out a series of face down cards connected like a road. Your little chess hero starts at one end and has to jump from one card to the next to reach the Big Bad at the other end. Each card you land on is turned over and will result in a random event. Sometimes it will mean combat (that will take you into 3rd person combat mode) but many other times it will be games of chance, or decision making that may affect you later, or risky opportunities. In the end, you reach the Big Bad, enter combat and fight to the death. Victory means you win new cards to add to your deck and a chance to play again to fight a new Big Bad. Defeat means the wizard reshuffles and deals again. You keep your victories over the previous Big Bads though.+ CombatFighting is all about building up hit streaks and finding a rhythm. Mouse and keyboard controls are slightly 'janky' but not bad enough to get in the way or make you lose a fight. There are many cards that enhance the things you can do in combat - they add weapons, equipment, spells, and so on. The combat mechanics are simple and could be improved, but the simplicity of the combat is also what allows this game to be a ""pick up and play"" type of game. I like the starting animation when your hero enters combat and puts on his gear, it's clever and it's an excellent in-game way to remind the player what cards he or she might be able to use in combat.+ Card CollectingEach time I won a game I unlocked new cards which I could add to my deck and play in the next game. The cards I unlocked were random, but also related to my wins and losses to the little battles and tests of luck against the wizard during the game. It made me feel like I had earned them. + Deck BuildingIf you know that the next card game is going to focus heavily on undead, for example, then you may want to tailor your deck in that direction. The deck builder is straightforward, but if you don't want to bother building a deck, the game will build it for you and it does a good job. I never unlocked too many cards per game, so I never felt swamped, so I always made my own deck. Just to add some spice, the game hid the precise details of new cards until I landed on them in a game, so if I added them to my deck it was a gamble, but a necessary one.+ Random EventsThese cards are the bulk of the game and they are what make it so much fun. They are surpisingly varied, and you can even encounter the same card you've seen before and get a totally different experience from it. These cards, coupled with the dialogue from the Wizard, who was talking directly to me, made the game feel personal and turned every victory or loss from these cards into a fun wager.+ Lore & AtmosphereThere is some lore surrounding the Big Bads and there's some lore present in the description of the various characters you meet while travelling, but overall it is light. All the atmospheric strength and character of this game emanates from three places: The first is the wizard and his desk. His hands and his eyes are expressive, I just dig him. The second is the Wizard's voice. I found him wry and sarcastic at times but also dark when he needed to be. And the third place is the deck of cards. I thought the art on the cards was well done and perfectly suited to this type of game.+ Game TimeA single game might be 15 to 30 minutes. So it's perfect for that moment of downtime. I'd say that during that harder difficulties you're more likely to spend 30 minutes on a game than 15, because you'll try different strategies or try for more cards, or get more combat. It just depends on your luck. Except for combat, the game runs at your pace.+ Other Thoughts- This is a game for someone who values their time, enjoys Call of Cthulhu, M:TG (3rd Ed, Ice Age, or Tempest), watching tv and playing a computer game at the same time because they don't really want to concentrate, and graphic novels.- It's probably best with a controller, good with a keyboard and mouse, definitely not with a trackpad.- Works on low-ish settings on my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro.I hope you got something from this review. I'm currently developing my own game called Heroes of the Antarctic[thinkpadius.com] which is an exploration roguelike set in the Antarctic during the early 1900s. Check it out if it interests you.

												Only half way through the game. The bad is that the combat seems a little janky (non-smooth animation transitions) but looking past that it's really fun. The core of the game, or at least what it is trying to accomplish, is really cool and very different then anything I am used too. The dealer interaction with you and the cards adds so much to this game. The game is mostly driven by RNG, but unless you get really unlucky things seem to be easy to accomplish if you think about what you're doing before you do it. I regret many of my game purchases, but I do not regret this one. Good work.			"

												Best way I can describe this game is 'Batman: Arkham Asylum combat meets Dungeons & Dragons meets a trading card game'. And you know what? I absolutely love it. The random nature of each game keeps you hungry for another level of cards to explore, and the game master you face throughout your adventure does a brilliant job voicing your mysterious adversary. It's addicting, it's clever, and you know what? I'll definitely be buying any and all DLC for this.			"

												Great game, fighting is similar to arkham asylum where you can parry the enemies moves, only difference is when you parry it forces the action so you cant spam it.Game is randomized by the cards, what peice you move on and the equipment you get.Runz good, lookz good, game iz good, read other reviews if you like but yeah get it.

												Quite fun as a mix of a board game & card game in mechanics with a bit of combat thrown in. Highly addictive game where you assemble a deck of cards on what you might encounter for equipment or encounters with the stranger you are playing against has his own cards to throw against you. From there the cards you pick for encounters are put out in a path for each section where sometimes you have a choice & others it's a straight path. Sometimes it's more of a 3rd person adventure style of combat against different opponents, other times with the encounters, you are given cards that have various success & failure, take your pick & your gains or losses will sometimes unlock new cards adding to the addictive nature of the game. Blessings & curses are random later on to make things quite a challenge as you gain new tactics to use or avoid to help you on your quest. From the unlocked cards, you can go back to battle old bosses with the added challenge of taking new cards in to make a familiar encounter completely new depending on the cards you get from what you picked. Highly recommended.			"

												This is a game I keep coming back to. As a concept it's great, building on an interesting collectable card game and adding an fun 3rd-player melee combat game on top.  It has it's flaws, like the annoying camera angle. At times it can be frustrating - but I find it's better in short doses of gameplay.Beyond the gameplay - the art and sound in this game are great, and the voice acting from the game master fits the mood perfectly (if again a little annoying with some of the repetition).Overall this is a 8.5/10 game.

												Only half way through the game. The bad is that the combat seems a little janky (non-smooth animation transitions) but looking past that it's really fun. The core of the game, or at least what it is trying to accomplish, is really cool and very different then anything I am used too. The dealer interaction with you and the cards adds so much to this game. The game is mostly driven by RNG, but unless you get really unlucky things seem to be easy to accomplish if you think about what you're doing before you do it. I regret many of my game purchases, but I do not regret this one. Good work.			"

												A beautiful and strange combation of card game and Batman-style fighting game. You play through a randomly generated dungeon layed out via cards on a tabletop. You move through the dungeon collecting gold and equipment, keeping an eye on your food, dodging traps and avoiding obsticles via ""pick a card"" style results. When you encounter combat, you are transported into what feels like an entirely different fighting game to resolve it. Everything about this game is pretty to look at and fun to do, however the combat is so incredibly simplified that it doesn't feel very challenging. You can't change the default character and skills come via equipment, which come via the collection of cards. You earn tokens and increase your hand by completing levels. If only combat was a little more involved this game would be near perfect. The best part by far is the narrator who's also the game master.			"

												I've owned this game for quite some time and am very happy to have seen evolve as it has. It is, in my opinion, an increadibly fun game and in all honesty I love damn near everything about this game, everything about a RPG/deck-building hybrid is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kick♥♥♥♥♥to me. But sadly there is one thing that is missing from what ""damn near"" covers, this being the combat. The combat just seems to me too easy. It being in the same style the of Ac and Batman: arkham X games, although granted the further you progress, the harder the enemies are and the harder combat gets(obviously), it has just felt to me that combat in these games lacked something. None the less it is still a great game that I would and do recommend to everyone. 9/10			"

												Hand of Fate is basically mixture of RPG's (like Hero Quest tabletop or Fighting Fantasy books), tabletop card games (like Magic The Gathering or Dominion) and it has few elements from Roguelike games (Nethack, Adom etc). Everything this is combined to good graphics and real time hack'n'slash. Fighting system is simple, intuitive and fun.There's plot, sort of, or actually there's lots of mini-adventures and missions in-game and there's plenty of mutators which make every game more or less different. Basically it's about challenging yourself and your decisions in the moment of truth - life, death and resurrection. It's combination of old-school fantasy atmosphere and modern interpretation. Most of all, this game shows love to the genre, love to the gaming itself and having fun while swinging sword. Original piece of game that's easy to enjoy time after time again.			"

												Hand Of Fate, not so family friendly Fantasy card game with real time combat. I love the game, I have beaten almost all of the bosses (stuck on the last one) and I love how hard the game is!My first expressions to Hand of fate were something like this: ""Another fantasy card game? Hearthstone ripp-off?"" But I was suprised how there is third-person realtime combat in this! So how does it work?The idea is this: There is the ""table"" where you have cards. You don't know what the cards are and as you move you unfold the cards one by one. Behind every card there could be a Fight, a choice, a shop or the Devil giving you something to kill. The more you play the more cards you get, and more cards you have, more difficult the game gets. Also the first time you kill a boss, it becomes a reqular encounter in the game. So don't be like me and say ""Now I will never have to fight him again..""

The writing is wonderful, and engine updates have made the game visually excellent by most any standards. It's a brilliant game, and easily one of the best of the year.The cherry on top? The developers are wonderful. A long time back when the game was still in early access, someone complained about a spider that would crawl around on the table at random times during play. I fired the game up recently to check out the (completely free and quite extensive) Christmas updates, scrolled through the options to see if anything was different, and noticed an option to turn the spider off.

The game plays out in two ways, the main display is a table with cards laid out which you need to move along and decide your actions as you reveal each card, and a combat phase on some cards that plays out like a rather simple but enjoyable Batman style combat system. Definitely worth it if you were a fan of the old choose your own adventure books or newer iterations like FTL.			"

												The arrival of cards is barely balanced out. Such uncommon game mechanics can be fun but mostly frustrating. As a player you feel very detached from what is going on since you can't influence anything (either encounters or you can't go back to a previous level or you can't even heal yourself and the story is almost non-existent). This game is a feast of randomness. You can get a tough fight and almost useless reward or vice versa. Or you can get several hard fights in a row. The game can plant a couple of mini-bosses into a regular fight. Another session you may get a boss fight just one card away from the start armed only with basic equipment. What kept me playing was the melee system which resembled very much the one of Batman: Arkham Trilogy. Overall, it's a brilliant time-waster and it's worth taking a look because of its game mechanics. But most likely it'll be a short look.			"

The fighting gets old when every battle feels the same. But like I said, I strongly recommend the game and feel that if the combat scenarios were more deliberate, this game would be GOTY material.

												Absolutely fantastic game. It has some things that could be improved, for sure, but it's incredibly fun. It feels very magical; very surreal. I feel like I'm in the Iron Ring or something. With a little imagination, it's easy to become immersed in the game and feel like you're on a cool adventure in a far-off land.EDIT: I can't believe how many free updates the devs wound up putting out for the game! Awesome dev team!			"

												Highly Recommended. The kind of hybrid board\action game that I would adore to have physically exist. Brought magically to life with excellent digital ambiance. While the random factor can lead to games where it all goes wrong and you can't win even if you tried, much like FTL, I find myself starting one more new game every time.			"

												Awesome game, one of the rare games I completed.It's sort of like 'Binding of Isaac' for not so hardcore players.- It has a sort of Heartstone-ish ( or Gwent from Witcher) play with the cards, deciding your adventure - depending on your choices.It's just easy and fun. But you will die, you will die a lot. But each game is new and helps keep it fresh.- And it's fun hunting new cards or try to unlock the token on new cards. And in the end, build your own deck - So you can remove those pesky annoying cards you dislike.Oh, and there is Endless Mode when the campaign is done. I die so much in that mode, so I've given up on that part of the game, I just enjoy the (doable) campaign - And really would like more!(Endless mode is a game mode where all cards are in play, and you can continue forever).Also, the developers have made tons of updates and listen to the community, and now they work on Hand of Fate 2. Which I will buy at full price, as soon as it is out.Pro Tip; Use it with a controller.			"

												This is a deck building roguelike RPG with an awesome art direction. Each ""level"" is a series of cards drawn on the table. You're represented as a golden pawn that cah go to the verry next cards. Each card is an encounter. It can be good for you, bad for you, test your luck (or ability to not be fooled...) or oblige you to fight.Your equipement are cards. You earn token that unlocks more cards. Every random aspect of the game is handeled by cards.The compat system makes it an action-RPG. The combat mechanices are the same as in the recent Batman games and it's really pleasing. From a Game Design standpoint it's a little marvel. I urge you to try it out! "

												The game may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if it matches your personality and what you like, look out. I don't have a lot of hours on record yet--mostly because it's a little hard on my outdated laptop--but I fully expect that number to skyrocket. It's everything I could want and more, despite being a relatively simple game.Which is why I say it's likely not for everyone. The gameplay is very straightforward. There's not much to it. If you get bored easily, it might not be more than a time waster for you (and a possibly pricey one). At worst, you may grow tired of it completely. For me, though, I can't get enough. Granted, as a Dungeon Master, it really taps into my sense of adventure designing. Even though you come across the same cards and do the same things, it's still delightfully interesting thinking on how things interact and work to bring you where you are. Every play is a different adventure, and that appeals to me.And though the gameplay is relatively simple, that also means that it's very solid. While there's some luck to it, admittedly, I still feel like I am in control. When I lose, it's my fault, when I win, it's because I planned well.All in all, I am incredibly pleased. For the adventure lovers, for those who kind of like coming up with their own story with a vaguer backbone, this is for you. For the rest... I dunno, go watch somebody play for a bit, and decide for yourself.			"

												Hand Of Fate, not so family friendly Fantasy card game with real time combat. I love the game, I have beaten almost all of the bosses (stuck on the last one) and I love how hard the game is!My first expressions to Hand of fate were something like this: ""Another fantasy card game? Hearthstone ripp-off?"" But I was suprised how there is third-person realtime combat in this! So how does it work?The idea is this: There is the ""table"" where you have cards. You don't know what the cards are and as you move you unfold the cards one by one. Behind every card there could be a Fight, a choice, a shop or the Devil giving you something to kill. The more you play the more cards you get, and more cards you have, more difficult the game gets. Also the first time you kill a boss, it becomes a reqular encounter in the game. So don't be like me and say ""Now I will never have to fight him again..""

												It's a turn-based roguelike card-game with realtime combat, a tremendous amount of replayability, and a fantastic atmosphere that brilliantly mixes the creepiness of the dealer with the thrill of a fantastical adventure. The writing is wonderful, and engine updates have made the game visually excellent by most any standards. It's a brilliant game, and easily one of the best of the year.The cherry on top? The developers are wonderful. A long time back when the game was still in early access, someone complained about a spider that would crawl around on the table at random times during play. I fired the game up recently to check out the (completely free and quite extensive) Christmas updates, scrolled through the options to see if anything was different, and noticed an option to turn the spider off. These guys are the best, and if the game interests you, they absolutely deserve your money.			"

												At first glance, Hand of Fate feels like a spin off of Fables but it turns out to something more cerebal than just your average action game.The game structure takes elements of a rogue like by gambling with your resources with each step towards progress and when engaging in combat, it has an odd touch of making it feel almost like Arkham series of Batman, trading blows in rhyme to countering or rolling away from harm.It shares a similar structure to something like Darkest Dungeon - a random generated dungeon awaits for you to explore, you micro manage what little supplies you have and hope that the random encounters work out in your favour.If you enjoy rogue like games or management based games, this is a combination that I can easily recommend.

												Excellent game. I've come back to it over and over again since I bought it in Feb and the developers have put out several free content patches as well as a few small DLC packs. The game plays out in two ways, the main display is a table with cards laid out which you need to move along and decide your actions as you reveal each card, and a combat phase on some cards that plays out like a rather simple but enjoyable Batman style combat system. Definitely worth it if you were a fan of the old choose your own adventure books or newer iterations like FTL.			"

												This game came up in my recommendations list with a lot of positive reviews and looked interesting so I gave it a shot.  Very glad I did, this game is really good.It's a deck builder - a card game where you gain more, better cards to add to your deck as you progress through the game.  You sit at a table facing a hooded mage who controls the cards and narrated the story.  The voice acting is very good and once you have drawn the same card a couple of times the narration for that card is muted so you don't end up running through the same dialoque game after game.  It's kind of like playing a single player RPG with the mage as DM expanding the story around the cards drawn.  The voice (and the image of the DM to a degree) put me in mind of John Hurt which is cool.The DM deals out a number of cards in a pattern depicting the path (or paths) you have to travel before meeting the final enemy.  You can choose which way to go by which cards you turn over on the path (although some are straight so no choice) and you can be lucky and find the exit to the next level quickly meaning you can skip forward but possibly miss out on finding a shop or other useful encounter.  I prefer to take my chances of drawing a bad encounter for the benefits of potentially better equipment/more cards.The decks consist of armour, weapons, enchantments and food as well as enounters both good and bad.  Some enounters involve a test of luck where you have to choose a 'success' card from a selection of four cards.  These are displayed before being shuffled so there is a chance you can follow the best card before they are dealt face down.  Winning encounters let you draw cards from your deck giving you the chance to upgrade your armour, weapons or giving you more food (needed to heal)It's not just a static card game however.  The battles are actually played out as a third person skirmish with you controlling your character fighting, blocking and using any special abilities granted by your equipment.  This is the part that really marks the game out as different and deepens your sense of involvement - you're not just sat at a table playing cards, you are truly part of the story which is unfolding.Completing the final enemy grants you additional cards for your deck and every fourth quest grants you an item from the DM levelling up both your character and the enemies you will face.If you are unfamiliar with deckbuilding or just want to progress to the next game quickly, at the start of each quest you have the option of using a recommended deck based on y0our cards.  If you wish, you can then go in and edit the deck to your satisfaction although newly gained cards will not reveal their effects until they have been played.There is the skill of choosing which cards you own will be best suited to the upcoming quest.  This gets more important the further you progress and the more cards you have.Overall, a very enjoyable and quite relaxing game, definitely worth the money.			"

												Alot of people talk about Rogue-likes as these hard-core, unforgiving, all-or-nothing, RNG dependant dungeon crawls... and many of them are. However, if you've played the original Rogue (or Rogue Legacy), you'll find that many game designers who classify their game as a ""Rogue-like"" have only copied the most sadistic parts of that game and ignored some of the more interesting and rewarding parts. Hand of Fate manages to replicate some of the progression aspects that the original Rogue utilized that made me actually love that game and reconsider the ""Rogue-like"" genre entirely. Hand of Fate, like Rogue, is not all-or-nothing. Rather it's a game of incrimental progress. You fight your way as far as you can, gathering tokens (think, card booster packs) along the way, and apon reaching a reset condition (either beating a boss in storymode or dying), those tokens reveal and add weapons, encounters, or armor to your deck which you can then use to enhance your next experiance. That way, you don't feel like you're bashing your head against a wall of RNG spite. In almost every playthrough of Hand of Fate, you're going to come away with something you can add to your deck to slant the odds ever-so-slightly more in your favor, and that's a motivator to keep on playing.As for Hand of Fate's drawbacks? I'd have to say it's combat leaves alot to be deisred. It's a watered down counter-system ala Batman Arkham Asylum that offers very little in terms of variety, fluidity or technique. You occationally get abilities to use and dodges to execute but that doesn't save the whole engagment from being awkward. If there were ever a Hand of Fate 2, (which I'd certainly hope for,) I'd say the combat stands to benefit the most from a reassessment.  "

												Only half way through the game. The bad is that the combat seems a little janky (non-smooth animation transitions) but looking past that it's really fun. The core of the game, or at least what it is trying to accomplish, is really cool and very different then anything I am used too. The dealer interaction with you and the cards adds so much to this game. The game is mostly driven by RNG, but unless you get really unlucky things seem to be easy to accomplish if you think about what you're doing before you do it. I regret many of my game purchases, but I do not regret this one. Good work.			"

Fun. Straightforward. Atmospheric. Pick up and play. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to play a card game against a mysterious wizard, then this is the game for you. Just by sitting at a table to play cards against this man, the game does a wonderful job at world building. It creates the impression you're in some sort of Arabian Nights tale, or perhaps one of the Call of Cthulhu back stories. Either way, I was quickly sucked in.All the card game's rules are handled by your wizard friend, who is both your opponent and your friendly dealer. The learning process for this game was quick. The tutorial is a natural part of the game and a natural part of story progression, which I thought was well done.+ The Game ItselfThe wizard lays out a series of face down cards connected like a road. Your little chess hero starts at one end and has to jump from one card to the next to reach the Big Bad at the other end. Each card you land on is turned over and will result in a random event. Sometimes it will mean combat (that will take you into 3rd person combat mode) but many other times it will be games of chance, or decision making that may affect you later, or risky opportunities. In the end, you reach the Big Bad, enter combat and fight to the death. Victory means you win new cards to add to your deck and a chance to play again to fight a new Big Bad. Defeat means the wizard reshuffles and deals again. You keep your victories over the previous Big Bads though.+ CombatFighting is all about building up hit streaks and finding a rhythm. Mouse and keyboard controls are slightly 'janky' but not bad enough to get in the way or make you lose a fight. There are many cards that enhance the things you can do in combat - they add weapons, equipment, spells, and so on. The combat mechanics are simple and could be improved, but the simplicity of the combat is also what allows this game to be a ""pick up and play"" type of game. I like the starting animation when your hero enters combat and puts on his gear, it's clever and it's an excellent in-game way to remind the player what cards he or she might be able to use in combat.+ Card CollectingEach time I won a game I unlocked new cards which I could add to my deck and play in the next game. The cards I unlocked were random, but also related to my wins and losses to the little battles and tests of luck against the wizard during the game. It made me feel like I had earned them. + Deck BuildingIf you know that the next card game is going to focus heavily on undead, for example, then you may want to tailor your deck in that direction. The deck builder is straightforward, but if you don't want to bother building a deck, the game will build it for you and it does a good job. I never unlocked too many cards per game, so I never felt swamped, so I always made my own deck. Just to add some spice, the game hid the precise details of new cards until I landed on them in a game, so if I added them to my deck it was a gamble, but a necessary one.+ Random EventsThese cards are the bulk of the game and they are what make it so much fun. They are surpisingly varied, and you can even encounter the same card you've seen before and get a totally different experience from it. These cards, coupled with the dialogue from the Wizard, who was talking directly to me, made the game feel personal and turned every victory or loss from these cards into a fun wager.+ Lore & AtmosphereThere is some lore surrounding the Big Bads and there's some lore present in the description of the various characters you meet while travelling, but overall it is light. All the atmospheric strength and character of this game emanates from three places: The first is the wizard and his desk. His hands and his eyes are expressive, I just dig him. The second is the Wizard's voice. I found him wry and sarcastic at times but also dark when he needed to be. And the third place is the deck of cards. I thought the art on the cards was well done and perfectly suited to this type of game.+ Game TimeA single game might be 15 to 30 minutes. So it's perfect for that moment of downtime. I'd say that during that harder difficulties you're more likely to spend 30 minutes on a game than 15, because you'll try different strategies or try for more cards, or get more combat. It just depends on your luck. Except for combat, the game runs at your pace.+ Other Thoughts- This is a game for someone who values their time, enjoys Call of Cthulhu, M:TG (3rd Ed, Ice Age, or Tempest), watching tv and playing a computer game at the same time because they don't really want to concentrate, and graphic novels.- It's probably best with a controller, good with a keyboard and mouse, definitely not with a trackpad.- Works on low-ish settings on my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro.I hope you got something from this review. I'm currently developing my own game called Heroes of the Antarctic[thinkpadius.com] which is an exploration roguelike set in the Antarctic during the early 1900s. Check it out if it interests you.

												Best way I can describe this game is 'Batman: Arkham Asylum combat meets Dungeons & Dragons meets a trading card game'. And you know what? I absolutely love it. The random nature of each game keeps you hungry for another level of cards to explore, and the game master you face throughout your adventure does a brilliant job voicing your mysterious adversary. It's addicting, it's clever, and you know what? I'll definitely be buying any and all DLC for this.			"

You can choose which way to go by which cards you turn over on the path (although some are straight so no choice) and you can be lucky and find the exit to the next level quickly meaning you can skip forward but possibly miss out on finding a shop or other useful encounter.  I prefer to take my chances of drawing a bad encounter for the benefits of potentially better equipment/more cards.The decks consist of armour, weapons, enchantments and food as well as enounters both good and bad.  Some enounters involve a test of luck where you have to choose a 'success' card from a selection of four cards.  These are displayed before being shuffled so there is a chance you can follow the best card before they are dealt face down.  Winning encounters let you draw cards from your deck giving you the chance to upgrade your armour, weapons or giving you more food (needed to heal)It's not just a static card game however.  The battles are actually played out as a third person skirmish with you controlling your character fighting, blocking and using any special abilities granted by your equipment.  This is the part that really marks the game out as different and deepens your sense of involvement - you're not just sat at a table playing cards, you are truly part of the story which is unfolding.Completing the final enemy grants you additional cards for your deck and every fourth quest grants you an item from the DM levelling up both your character and the enemies you will face.If you are unfamiliar with deckbuilding or just want to progress to the next game quickly, at the start of each quest you have the option of using a recommended deck based on y0our cards.  If you wish, you can then go in and edit the deck to your satisfaction although newly gained cards will not reveal their effects until they have been played.There is the skill of choosing which cards you own will be best suited to the upcoming quest.  This gets more important the further you progress and the more cards you have.Overall, a very enjoyable and quite relaxing game, definitely worth the money.			"

Early Access Review
								Imagine Hearthstone, Batman AA, D&D, Darkest Dungeon, and Gauntlet had a baby...that baby's name is Hand of Fate. Then add a card dealer that actually feels like a real person is playing cards with you....I just cant say enough good about this game but I'm going to try.     This game is unbelievably good. The voice acting is literally perfect. It is so immersive watching all of the little animations that the  dealer uses and his comments are so on point that it is akin to psycho mantis from mgs. I really get the sense that I am playing cards with a powerful, mysterious and devious being and he is talking to ME! His covered face was a brilliant idea to add to the sense of mistrust.      This is truly a seamles mashup of several components. TCG, action, RPG, strategy. While Hand of Fate isn't a complete experience in any of the forementioned genres there is enough of each one that somehow when combined...is so throughly entertaining and enthralling I simply cannot put it down. The concept is so simple yet so brilliant it's a wonder noone has made a game like this years ago. The gameplay is so fun that I played the game for 7.4 hours straight the same night I purchased it. It is realy a unique experience. What a gem! I really cant say enough about the dealer's character he makes every single moment of this game feel meaningful and the absolutely nailed the atmosphere. The presentation is top notch. there are so many wonderful details such as the way the candle burns down as the game goes on and as such the room becomes darker.      I was so filled with wonder, excitement, terror, joy and anger while playing this game. The games difficulty seems to ramp up nicely. I am not even half way done with this game yet but I am so looking forward to the bosses and cards that I will unlock next but most of all I am looking forward to unraveling the mystereis behind the dealer and what this game is all about.      Fascinatingly there is no tutorial you are simply thrust into the game and yet I can tell that this is not an oversight, it is deliberate and the dealer makes mention of it several times. If you've ever played a videogame before you will figure it out and the gameply is so intuitive that to my surprise, no tutorial is necessary! He will wager some precious artifacts if you win you earn them if you lose you will have to roll your deck again and he will deal the dungeons from the beginning.      I took a chance on this game because I really like TCG and the way that this suppossedly had an action elemant sounded interesting and unique and I am so glad I did. Now that I know how good this game is I would have gladly spent twice the price I paid. Unless you are some sort of gibbering idiot who only plays madden games you will definitely love this game. I seriously cannot imagine anyone not liking this game; it is straight up fun! The game really put a smile on my face very quickly and then gradually became very challanging. I really love Hand of Fate. I give HOF my highest reccomendation and I would place this game among my top favorite games of all time.			"

												Only half way through the game. The bad is that the combat seems a little janky (non-smooth animation transitions) but looking past that it's really fun. The core of the game, or at least what it is trying to accomplish, is really cool and very different then anything I am used too. The dealer interaction with you and the cards adds so much to this game. The game is mostly driven by RNG, but unless you get really unlucky things seem to be easy to accomplish if you think about what you're doing before you do it. I regret many of my game purchases, but I do not regret this one. Good work.			"

I love the combination of tabletop card game along with actual controlling of your character.There's already a large amount of gameplay to be had and the devs are planning on expanding.Some of the boss fights do require a large amount of strategy; you can't just run around tanking everything. I've been looking to get into tabletop games and I'm glad I found Hand of Fate!			"

												A very clever card game that springs the locales and situations you reveal upon choosing cards to life. There's strategy in choosing your deck, weapons and items to upgrade, and the usual RPG trappings. Awesomewaxmustachesauce! The weakest part in my opinion is perhaps the combat system- it feels a bit janky sometimes. Bob Dole!- but overall it's quite fun and this game is most certainly worth your time at the cost of a few coins you've gathered from real life dungeons. Tutu tickle dance, go!			"

								Great so far. A really unique combination of card came and brawling. It lets you walk that fine line between having your life in your own hands and leaving it up to luck of the draw.Since it's early access though there are a few things I would still like to see. Slightly smoother, more interesting combat and Perhaps a ""endless run"" mode where you just keep going deeper and deeper with each floor adding more and more challenging cards.			"

												Fun game. Different concept. You essentially play a card game that combines real 3rd person fighting. The fighting is pretty easy at first with certain mechanics almost broken, but it can be more challenging with hardmode. The combat doesn't initially seem all that diverse though and could become tiresome. I don't feel like the game is worth its initial $20 price tag, but if you get it on sale or in a bundle then it could be worth it.			"

												Hand of Fate is a really fun card game with beat 'em up elements. The game features two modes; Story and Endless. This will mostly be focused on Story, as I've not played Endless yet.The game is fairly simple; the dealer will lie down cards on the table and you will move your piece onto the cards. Sometimes, this is linear, but sometimes it isn't. Some cards will activate things like visiting a shop, encountering baddies to kill, traversing a maze or coming up against a situation where, of 4 cards, you must pick the ""Success"" card in order to win. You will have, at the bottom right, three ""stats"": your health, your food & your gold. Every move consumes 1 food, but you'll restore lost health. Gold is fairly self-explanatory.When you get an encounter card, you are placed onto a small plot of field where you will fight against monsters, ranging from goblins to skeletons, zombies and bandits. While variation is limited, it doesn't pull away from the experience. However, the fighting / combat is rather wonky; borrowing from the Arkham series, you will basically use WASD to move around and left click to attack. You cannot hard target a specific enemy, which can be a bit frustrating, but again, really doesn't affect the game greatly.Situation cards vary, from finding a weapon in a crevasse to saving someone from being swarmed by enemies. Successfully ""winning"" these situations nets you a token from the dealer. At the end, all of your accrued tokens are counted up and you are given specific rewards based on the tokens. For example, I was tasked with defeated a knight that had been overrun by some skeletons. Once I defeated them, he told me I could keep the mace I was given prior to the fight, as his kingdom was flush with them. Once I completed the level, his token rewarded me with 2 Mace cards.You progress through the 'levels' by travsering through the cards, finding that particular level's 'end card' and moving onto the next level. At the end of the final level, you will fight a boss. Defeating the boss gives you more tokens, which unlock things like weapons, armor, encounters and other varying cards.One of the coolest things this game offers is the Deck Builder. On one side, your deck has cards for Equipment; weapons and armor and trinkets. The other side are your encounters, from visiting shops to situations. If the card has a lock icon on it, that means it has a situation / encounter you've yet to face. Drawing & defeating that card will net you another token.Last but not least is the Dealer himself; an elderly mage who speaks to you throughout the game. His dialogue is superb and I found myself actively listening to what he had to say. The first level, I drew a card that had a goblin giving me a shield. The next level, I drew the card again and, in this very dry tone, he said ""I think you purposefully put that card in there just to get an early shield."" (or something to that effect) It's minor, but the fact he recognizes that made me smile.I know my hours played as of writing this is low (think it's barely 2 hours), but honestly - the game is immediately fun. The combat is a bit wonky, but everything else excels so well that I don't mind. It doesn't hurt that the game also looks really good & sounds pretty good, too. I can't wait to jump back into the game and have more fun with it. :)			"

												An excellent roguelite based on the idea of choice, chance, and consequence. Many players have commented on the increase in difficulty. This is true. But several people ignore the fact that it's about chance and consequence. One reviewer mentioned a card that makes you lose 66% of your max health. This is true. But you can ignore that completely and just not take the chance. If you do it and succeed though, you get a HUGE reward. There aren't any cards that just exist to kill you. There are many that exist that let you risk death for the prospect of reward, though.			"

												Fun game. Different concept. You essentially play a card game that combines real 3rd person fighting. The fighting is pretty easy at first with certain mechanics almost broken, but it can be more challenging with hardmode. The combat doesn't initially seem all that diverse though and could become tiresome. I don't feel like the game is worth its initial $20 price tag, but if you get it on sale or in a bundle then it could be worth it.			"

												Hand of Fate is a really fun card game with beat 'em up elements. The game features two modes; Story and Endless. This will mostly be focused on Story, as I've not played Endless yet.The game is fairly simple; the dealer will lie down cards on the table and you will move your piece onto the cards. Sometimes, this is linear, but sometimes it isn't. Some cards will activate things like visiting a shop, encountering baddies to kill, traversing a maze or coming up against a situation where, of 4 cards, you must pick the ""Success"" card in order to win. You will have, at the bottom right, three ""stats"": your health, your food & your gold. Every move consumes 1 food, but you'll restore lost health. Gold is fairly self-explanatory.When you get an encounter card, you are placed onto a small plot of field where you will fight against monsters, ranging from goblins to skeletons, zombies and bandits. While variation is limited, it doesn't pull away from the experience. However, the fighting / combat is rather wonky; borrowing from the Arkham series, you will basically use WASD to move around and left click to attack. You cannot hard target a specific enemy, which can be a bit frustrating, but again, really doesn't affect the game greatly.Situation cards vary, from finding a weapon in a crevasse to saving someone from being swarmed by enemies. Successfully ""winning"" these situations nets you a token from the dealer. At the end, all of your accrued tokens are counted up and you are given specific rewards based on the tokens. For example, I was tasked with defeated a knight that had been overrun by some skeletons. Once I defeated them, he told me I could keep the mace I was given prior to the fight, as his kingdom was flush with them. Once I completed the level, his token rewarded me with 2 Mace cards.You progress through the 'levels' by travsering through the cards, finding that particular level's 'end card' and moving onto the next level. At the end of the final level, you will fight a boss. Defeating the boss gives you more tokens, which unlock things like weapons, armor, encounters and other varying cards.One of the coolest things this game offers is the Deck Builder. On one side, your deck has cards for Equipment; weapons and armor and trinkets. The other side are your encounters, from visiting shops to situations. If the card has a lock icon on it, that means it has a situation / encounter you've yet to face. Drawing & defeating that card will net you another token.Last but not least is the Dealer himself; an elderly mage who speaks to you throughout the game. His dialogue is superb and I found myself actively listening to what he had to say. The first level, I drew a card that had a goblin giving me a shield. The next level, I drew the card again and, in this very dry tone, he said ""I think you purposefully put that card in there just to get an early shield."" (or something to that effect) It's minor, but the fact he recognizes that made me smile.I know my hours played as of writing this is low (think it's barely 2 hours), but honestly - the game is immediately fun. The combat is a bit wonky, but everything else excels so well that I don't mind. It doesn't hurt that the game also looks really good & sounds pretty good, too. I can't wait to jump back into the game and have more fun with it. :)			"

												This is a fanatistic game.  I purchased this game on a whim when it was on sale and it is wonderful!  The graphics are great, it has a story, the controls are easy to use (something that is very important to me since I'm rusty in reguards to PC controls) and it blends cards games with rpg.  It is like playing the dungeon and dragons game I have always wanted to play.  It is completely worth the price!			"

												While it gets bone-crushingly hard towards the end, making you go back to grind for specific card upgrades that are just hard to live without, everything up to that point is very enjoyable and while the combat isn't standout, its still fun and satisfying enough. Great visual style, narration, and framing device of the whole game with the dealer as well.			"

												I was searching for something new to play instead of all the same online battle games. Then I saw 'Hand of Fate' and thought - hmm that looks interesting and the graphics aren't bad.....so I bought it and started playing.In the begining I thought, OMG - I'll never learn / understand this concept of game - BUT after the first 3-4 rounds I couldn't stop playing. It's really entertaining if you are into fantasy / role-card-game / adventure story.			"

												Honestly, it does not feel much like a card game, probably because you never really get to interact with the cards or make meaningful choices with them, except for when you're editing the deck. It plays and feels more like a randomly generated dungeon crawler, with you being able to alter the probability of various instances in the dungeon, through deck maniplation. And with some Arkham-style combat thrown in, for good measure. But acknowledging is not demereting the game, as the systems being used, and the gameplay, is very enjoyable and presented in an interesting fashion.			"

												Overall a very enjoyable experience.The story unfolds through the cards, giving little glimpses of a plot that the game leaves to your interpretation.The combat in itself is pretty basic, but then again, there sholdn't even be action combat in this kind of game, so it comes off as a very nice breath of fresh air from the standard rogue-like game.The soundtrack is pretty sweet, the sound effects are never exxagerated or annoying and the dealer's voice is just perfect.The only really bad side of this game is in the last 2-3 story runs:While the game ups its difficulty by adding new cards and mechanics and presenting you with choices for its full (very enjoyable) duration, the last runs, especially the final run, is completely based on RNG and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. You try and die countless times until you finally get that perfect run where everything just runs smoothly.However, that is only true for the last story run, the whole game is really enjoyable and the Endless Mode gives some pretty nice replayability.[Possible Spoilers Do not read further]The game ends in the most abrupt manner.You beat the Dealer, screen goes black, you're back at the starting screen.No cheeky comment, no ending, no nothing.It ends so badly that i actually thought i experienced a glitch, that some cutscene of some sort just got jumped for some reason, but that doesn't seem to be the case.And honestly after the phisical torture that is the last Story Run, i at least wanted some insight on the Dealer, the Player, the game, something, ANYTHING, but it just didn't happen and it tastes so bitter.

												As a early accss player it always feels like playing poker with your money if devs finish the game or runs away and tells the fans to finish it or just doesent finish it . but my thought of buying this was i want something diffrent from the medicore games that we get in the todays game industri. And this game delivers that it mixes card games and combat games like batman games combat. its not a bad thing.Is it depended on the cards and what can you do with it. not alot but that makes it good in a way let me explain.Its like building your own adventure. and you can choose what cards you want to see. you can also let the game choose for you if you like. and the dealer has own cards that you need to face.Thats covering the postivesThe negetivs.Combat still feels lite bit floaty.some boss cards that you need to face can feel abit cheap. and some cards can really ♥♥♥♥ you up like the helpful priest if you choose the wrong card the game can get very difficult.No story about the bearded guy you play as.some equipment feels pointless.That may be a postive yes but you will be sometimes annoyed of it.and im happy for the dev to finish the game becuse its great and i hope it gets good amount of attention.its a good dev that allows you to earn money if you are a lets player. (cough) nintendo and sega.and he really listen to the community becuse in the early access progress it was pretty bad sometimes. but there is always ups and downs in the progress. and yes i would recommend this game.

												I want to warn everyone who wants to have this game ! The game starts awesome yet you will stop playing it once you reach 5th or 6th deck (level).The difficulty of the game increases immensely. Cards won't help you. You will die a lot and you will restart the deck which means you are going to kill everything that you killed previously. Then you will find yourself skipping everything (Cards ask you if you want to cross the river or not ? - Do you want the chest ? or not ?. I personally died a lot and started to click NO to every options to reach the boss fight in order to pass the level and have some other new features. Trust me it does not help !I need to be honest. I love the atmosphere, ideas and gameplay yet the game design gets too limited when you move further in this game. You play the same fights over and over. You pick the same cards over and over. Still I liked it yet I recommend you to wait for the sale to buy it ;)			"

												The Arkham Combat System (ACS) is the weakest part of the game and highlighted by some of the relatively small arena spaces and somewhat stiff animations. However, every other mechanic of the game makes up for the ACS. Hand of Fate is an excellent, unique combination of gaming sytems that would best be described as the hidden mechanics of many videogame RPGs brought out and given a life via the cards and their 'choose your own adventure' dealer. The themes and art are great and the narration is fitting and well done. Aside from some personal issues with the ACS, I recommend this to anyone that is a fan of card games and Medieval-style RPGs.

												Played this game since early access and it's only gotten better upon release.  This is a wonderful blend of deckbuilding, board games, and arena combat.  It features great organic storytelling with individual encounters stringing together a journey towards a big boss that you play in sessions.  The combat is smooth, fluid, and highly skill based.  You are dropped into an arena for combat and you need to fight, break guards, and counter your opponent to kill them before they kill you.  Outside of combat, you make choices and take chances to advance your story and unlock new cards for different encounters.It's a magical experience where you feel immersed in a world even when not fighting.  The game is very heavily RNG based, but I'd say it is more reliant on skill than other rogue-like games.  You can still get screwed by RNG, but you can survive a surprising amount through sheer force of will and skill.Musically, the game is superb, with memorable battle music, suspenseful main themes, and a very peaceful shop and certain encounter music.  The best part though is the narrator, who is equal parts friend and foe, your companion through the game who both tries to kill you, but also encourages and balances your experience.  Every line of dialogue from him is quote worthy and awesome.Graphics are...one of the games few problems.  Card art is great and even the 3d designs are cool, but it's a bit low quality and prone to clipping.  Numerous times I've played the game and monsters or my character will get caught in scenery or the character models will freak out rag doll style at the end of combat.  Most of the time its not game breaking, but it can be annoying.  And there are a few bugs that need to be worked out.  More than once, I've had my music and sound effects fail on me.These are minor annoyances for a highly unique and surprisingly addictive game though.  Highly recommended.  Fair warning though, the final boss is total BS and feels very unfair, so be prepared for a little frustration.			"

												This game pulls of a mix of genres so well, it's really quite refreshing. There's the simple action fighting aspect (which I guess could be improved, but since it's secondary it's not a huge deal), and the DnD type aspect, and the Deck building part. It's such a unique and refreshing twist on everything. I feel like that will lend to so much replayability. The graphics are rather impressive too. For a game just abrely out of early access (apparently) it's really well done. I can't wait to see where they go from here.

It definitely isn't for everyone, but don't listen to the people who say it's all or heavily luck based, because it's not. A good strategy will win in the end (I reccomend building your own deck, not using their pre-built ones).It has some minor glitches, so keep that in mind, but they release bug fixes periodically, which makes this okay.This is a good game to pick up and play either casually, or to get immersed in for hours.

												The way I see it, this game is like the best piece of dessert in the entire planet with a unique property.You have no idea that it *IS* the greatest tasting confectionry in history, but when you do consume some, your mind simply explodes with the indescribably wonderful flavor. But once you are finished with that bite, the memory of it fades, and you are left curious as to what it would taste like again. If you continue to consume it, you eventually finish it off, with none of it remaining, and you are left with only a stomach full of disappointment.The same applies to this artful game of chance, wonder, and imposing threat. When played in only single-run sessions, the curiosity remains as fresh as the day you bought this game. The possiblities of new events are ever enticing, to the point where you might lose sleep over the thought, ""What if I HADN'T given that peasant some food?""Overall, I'd have to say this was a very worthy purchase. Best $20 impulse buy since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.			"

												Very unique, and interesting game and most importantly a lot of fun! If you like gamebooks (esp. fighting fantasy series), you will like this game, and if you enjoy RPGs I highly suggest giving this game a chance. You play as an adventurer who has to defeat a set of bosses that are like tiers of each other, but not really in a way making it repetetive. You collect cards that make up the game and put them in the main playing deck and basically yours are meant to better your chances, and the dealer puts in cards to make it more challenging. Its amazingly fun collecting the cards to unlock new encounters and the dlc is actually a rare dlc that does in fact give you something new, it adds cards that change the rules from the start which makes it a LOT more replayable.The artwork is GREAT, like I mean really, really good and the fights sequences gain a lot from that. I esp. like the tomb/crypt area when you fight undead. The real only negatives are that the fights can get a bit boring, but not really such a big deal....another thing is a pretty annoying bug that causes background card shuffle noises (pls fix!!!!) that drives you mad if you don´t restart the game lol. All in all great, unique title worth its money with innovative ideas and solid gameplay I rate 9/10			"

												Kinda good, with a great ""but"".I really like the idea of the cards, the exploration, the different events and items. That part is really well done.However, to combine this with a pretty boring and kinda bad ""Batman""-like combat gameplay is very unfortunate. It's just not very fun and gets boring really fast, which is a shame. The same game with some other type of combat system would be really great. It's been fun for a few hours now, but I don't see myself finish it. However, if you can get this for cheap then give it a try.			"

Early Access Review
								Still rough around the edges but lots of fun. Far from Batman Arkham or Diablo and also not that open for exploration like Binding of Isaac or FTL and certainly not Hearthstone or MTG but this Jack of all trades and king of none brings something new to the table.As for now if you like Humble Bundle it totally worth 15$ + other games it comes with. Missed it? I'd buy it on a sale not thinking twice. Can be a very frustating game at times but what rogue-like isn't?Hopefully will make a better review once the game gone gold and out of the beta.

												As someone that doesn't normally like card games? This is an excellent title. It doesn't focus on the ""Trading Card"" mechanics in the fashion you normally see in alot games where cards are the biggest driver behind how the game functions. The cards instead allow you to essentially fashion your own dungeon, allowing you to play the way you want to, with the 'dealer' (AI) adding in his own cards to spice things up. Rather than a coin-toss or RNG for encounters where something is handled outside of combat, you are given the choice of 4 cards, Huge success/failure or normal success/failure, with the number of each varying between different encounters (for example, 50/50 success/failure or 3/1 failure/success ratios). The nice thing about this is that, for players with a fine eye for observation, you can actually watch and see which of these 4 cards land where, there is also equipment that will highlight one of the failures in these 4 options. Its...KIND'VE akin to a boardgame, but at the same time it is also a third-person action RPG. Whenever you come upon an encounter that requires you to fight you are dropped into 3rd person view with all the gear/bonuses you have equipped. Combat style is akin to a mix between Fable and Assassin's Creed. Dodging heavy attacks (which become far more frequent as you get into harder runs or further in endless mode) or countering when a marker pops up over an enemy's head. Despite the heavy 'telegraphing' (icons/warnings when an attack is incoming), combat doesn't feel as simplistic as it is in Assassin's creed, where 90% of all fights can be won by simply waiting for a counter then pummeling your enemy while he is stunned. Recent updates/free DLC content (as of the 5th of March, 2016) added numerous extra encounters, equipment and certain 'profiles' for lack of a better term (the exact name for them escapes me now). These new 'profiles' offer both unique challenges and bonuses for playstyle. For example, there IS an 'easy' mode now, where you gain substantial bonuses, but many achievements will not be accessible while playing on that profile. Whereas on the 'hard mode', you gain an increase in counter attack damage, but combat moves far quicker, enemies do more damage and you start with 20% less health. One last example (of the more 'unique' profiles) is 'merchant guard'. Throughout each 'run', players can earn gold coins to gain food (1 food per movement restores health, each time you move WITHOUT food however, you LOSE health), this can be refilled in encounters or at shops littered throughout. One of the profiles requires you to go to each and every shop on the board before you can move to the next part of the board. While shops offer everything cheaper, you ALWAYS have to fight before you enter the shop, and ambushes are far more frequent. Overall, I feel it is a refreshing change of pace from many RPGs on the market lately, that being said, I will decline from giving this game a 1-10 rating, however for those that are looking to step outside the norm, but love fast-paced combat, I would highly recommend Hand of Fate.﻿			"

It's a hybrid of a third person action game (for combat) and cards (for exploring and earning loot) and it's really casual and fun to play. Also it runs fine, smooth and has good graphics and audio.You'll not be disappointed with the purchase if you like these kind of games.			"

												Think DnD mixed with RPG combat style and some rougelike elements and you have a basic idea what this game is.The idea is creative, the graphics are very well done and it works suprisingly smoothly. The game itself has some elements I was looking for in MMORPG games for far too long, like ministories that reveal themselves only when you successfully beat something that has nothing to do with the main story (or anything, really) and it is great to see a game that uses these mechanics so well. To me it is a surprise that virtual card games can be so engaging. Only problem with the game is that sometimes when entering a battle the crashes, but even that is not such a big deal since the progress is saved for every card you complete. I would totally buy a set of these cards in real life. With some dice and small changes like not saying the same text every time you get the same card this would make a great bored game.			"

The replayability is pretty high in my opinion since most other rogue-likes are meant to be clean and simple, and some publishers make fps and different kinds of rogue-like elemented games but most of them can feel very cheap even if with lack of textures or that feeling to want to start over when you die a couple of times, this one on the other hand oh well ill have some explaining to do.first of its a card game, dont get me wrong its not just a card game ill get into more detail soon, so you start of with your basic cards against this anonymous and rather mysterious man who gives you enemies to fight and adventures to explore and each card is rather unique and have some ''chance'' in them wich he gives you four random cards to choose from such as success,huge success, failur, and huge failure depending on what you get in the situation of the card you are bound to make profit of it or fail miserably and loose something.You do get to make your own deck out of three possibilities you get your weapon deck where you pick weapons you like or even new once and just throw a bunch of them into a deck, then you have your charekter deck this kind of counts as a difficulty system where each charekter has perks and effects the difficulty of the gameplay there are a few classes you can get wich are dlc's and this game is totally worth buying them for but if you are still thinking wether or not you should buy then i reccomand buying it on sale and get those dlc's cheap but the price of 25$ is a low bargain for the content in my opinion and should totally be in your inventory unless your broke,Anyways theres also a third one and this one is interesting indeed, you get to pick your encounters and adventures in this one, now when you start the game you start of with a first boss there are 12 in total and you get a randomly generated card placement on the board, you move your charekter along those cards and use 1 suplie for each movement you make and regenerate some health along each movement when you lend on a card you will read your encounter and he will interact with each card you land on he has a rather awsome voice wich keeps you interested at every step so as i mentioned you can land on acts wich you must either counter by ignoring or trying to escape or take the high roll and accept requests from a stranger or offer somthing for a totally random aproach from the person, there are people who can be trusted and not and its up to you to decide about that.now in some occasions he will offer you a token for some encounters and if you do them successfully he will give it to you, hell just whip it out and throw that stuff right into your very own bowl and you'll get to open them even if you die or beat the whole playthrough, now the tokens can be opened after the game and you will recieve random brand new cards to your collection wich you can add in for your next playthrough so after a few playthroughs you will end up having a bunch of new cards and you'll have so many options to make so much stuff to add and to explore.Now we get to the sweet part when you get ambushed wether its from a failure of a card or if its a card wich triggers a fight you get into a battle and are given all the equipment that you start with or if you have found some weapons in a story or just when you went on a stroll it will go onto your charekter and you''ll enter a fight where you control your own charekter and you can use weapon abilities on some of them wich will may aid you in battle, if you have a shield you can counter attacks wich is really helpful, really if you dont have a shiled its just going to make the fight harder so be sure to have one, you can also have abilities with alot of verity. the battle system in this game is really fun and the game runs smoothly. now after you beat up and smash your way to victory you'll encounter the boss wich will always have unique abilities or enemies to aid him/her, after you beat him you will recieve a token and you'll get the chance to open/break all the tokens you have earned throughout the run, after you beat three bosses you will always be awarded with an item of his wich will both give you benefits and make the game harder at the same time, and the mysterious man will always be more and more irritable and nervous, but hes an awsome guy non the less and will always be found likable in any situations.This sums up some of my experience with the game it has much to offer and discover and is probably one or of if not my favorite game at the moment. Im really pleased that i got my hands on this gem i give it a 10/10 dont just sit there buy it! :-)			"

												Thoroughly recommend this game. I was pleasantly surprised by it and it's also addictive. It's a hybrid of a third person action game (for combat) and cards (for exploring and earning loot) and it's really casual and fun to play. Also it runs fine, smooth and has good graphics and audio.You'll not be disappointed with the purchase if you like these kind of games.			"

												Think DnD mixed with RPG combat style and some rougelike elements and you have a basic idea what this game is.The idea is creative, the graphics are very well done and it works suprisingly smoothly. The game itself has some elements I was looking for in MMORPG games for far too long, like ministories that reveal themselves only when you successfully beat something that has nothing to do with the main story (or anything, really) and it is great to see a game that uses these mechanics so well. To me it is a surprise that virtual card games can be so engaging. Only problem with the game is that sometimes when entering a battle the crashes, but even that is not such a big deal since the progress is saved for every card you complete. I would totally buy a set of these cards in real life. With some dice and small changes like not saying the same text every time you get the same card this would make a great bored game.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale without really researching what the game was like and only went off of the pictures that were on steam but I am still glad that I purchased this game because I found out that the game is extremely fun. The main mechanic that I like about the game is the randomised events that are represented by the cards which I find makes the game similar to Darkest Dungeon which is another game that I find extremely fun to play.

												The Dealer is what makes this game. Considering you spend 95% of your time interacting with him and listening to him, if he was in anyway written terribly, or voiced terribly, then it would kill the game for you because otherwise, all you had was some fun quests and mediocre Arkham combat.Thankfully, the Dealer is engaging, hardly ever repeats his lines, and even then, his delivery is so snarky and full of personality and flavor, you don't mind occasionally hearing the same line again. He will have up to 3, perhaps even more, different lines for the same card, or same kind of card (like the Helpful Priest line of cards, where he shows his disdain of the clergy).The Dealer's performance is what sells and buoys this game, especially as the rest of its features and mechanics, while serviceable, really aren't much to talk about. Specifically, the combat is closer I think to Assassin's Creed, where sitting and waiting on the counter indicator to appear is the best way to go, especially if you put it on Hard Mode from the outset (which I recommend, as otherwise the combat pace is even slower and easier).I would recommend buying this game on sale. I got mind for $10 during 2015's Holiday Sale, and it's completely worth the $10. At its full price, I would have hoped that the combat mechanics be more polished, as they do bring down the whole package and presentation of the game.			"

												A very successful blend of tabletop gaming and hack n slash fighting, The in-combat characters could use a bit of variety. ""Hellhounds"" are just rats with a fire like texture over the top. That is my only gripe with it other than i've only played 4 hours and I've over half completed the story.Make no mistake though, the developers did an amazing job creating such a unique game and the positives FAR outweigh any negatives I can think of, and the sheer amount of possibility with the different types of cards/decks make for great replay value though the main story does feel a bit short.Many different types of cards to play with. The ability to create your own decks for each run and the overwhelming feeling that you are playing for something much larger than mere cards and reward but for so much more, will you become the next dealer? Let the games begin.			"

												Hand of Fate is a good game, the simple brawler mechnics of the combat sequences are fun and challenging enough, like a slightly harder version of the Arkham/Batman games with far fewer variables or moves.  The narrator is amusing, the graphics cartoonish in a lovely way that pops on the screen totally appropriate for a game that is within a game.  The basic conciet of the game though is pretty briulliant - the player is playing cards against the enigmatic narrator who is some sort of dyspeptic frog voiced oracle or wizard. He's fun enough and he has new quips for most new cards, but I could I can see a DLC with a different dealer being profoundly satisfying - say a urbane devil, petulant child or defeatist death.  The card came is itself an adventure, with the randomly selected (you can build the decks though - within certian limits) card laid down and most cards offering a garphic of a charming woodblock image, a paragraph and a choice.  most selections lead to a pick and choose mechnic where four cards representing degrees of success and failure are shuffled monty style and the player picks one.  Other cards lead to combat.  In general when the player is successful with a card they gain a token that's convereted to another card at the end of each game.  Thus as one plays more and more choices are added.  It's fun, and for an ""unlock"" method of providing content feels very natural.Despite that praise, I almost gave this gave a thumbs down because even now, long after release (and to the developers' credit the seem to keep adding cards and content) the game seems to suffer from technical issues.  It lags, it slows and it crashes with alarming regularity on my laptop - which while no gaming machine is well above the minimum specs.  This isn't a general set of errors, more a steady degradation of capability culminating in multi minute load times for combat sequences or simply sudden crashes in the combat engine.  Whatever the cause these errors, they make the game frustratingly unplayable - becauase I want to play it and it's a good game.  I'm still giving it a positive rating here because when it does work (and sometimes it's fine) it's a very fun, very smart game.			"

												I'm not sure what to say. The dungeons are laid out as a string of cards, each being an encounter of some description. The Dealer is well voice acted and an evil genius, The brawler, which you enter when you encounter enemies, is good. Combat could be better, but you're never in it for very long. I have a strong feeling that this is a game I will come back to again and again and again.			"

												Really interesting enjoyable card game that happens to have 3D combat as well. The combat itself is the worst part of the game and it's not that it's bad, just that if the game was based around the combat it would not be a good game. Apart from the combat being very simplistic and pretty easy, the rest of the game is great, the card mechanics and way the dungeon master tells the story as you travel through the cards is great. It is a game that you can play through in a short period of time but has a ton of replay value as you do challenges of event cards you unlock even more event cards and items to add into a deck to unlock even more. And despite what some might say of the cards being shuffled face down randomly and impossible to track, if you watch the 4 cards that start face up and then get fliped carefully you can actually watch where the card goes to, its just a bit challenging if the card doesn't end up on the top or bottom of the deck when its shuffling them because its a lot harder to see how the middle cards come out. But it is possible to watch reguardless. So while to some people the 4 cards may just look like a random luck of the dice pick, it is possible to pick with a fair amount of confedence of what your picking if you watch the animation.All in all, if your looking for a game where the story is told through cards with alot of different interesting events, with some light combat, this is a really good game. If your looking for a good 3d action combat focused game then this is not the game for you. The combat is the weakest part, but it doesn't drag it down to not enjoy the rest of the game. So if you think you might like a story told to you in a mixure of cards you travel through with a bit of choose your own adventure with each of those cards, and a shell game to resolve the choose your own adventure events, with light combat tossed in as well, then its worth getting.

												I recommend this game, but there are a couple of things that are seriously irritating. The camera view when you are fighting or going through traps cannot be moved, so you cannot see what is all around you. I have died a few times because of it. The other is that when you start the game, if you have two monitors set up, the game shows up on my left screen instead of my right like all other games do. I am not sure what causes it, but it is irritating. Otherwise, this game is very fun and unique as an RPG/Card game. The stories are interesting and the story teller and his personallity is great.

												This game is AWESOME! It's a new take on an RPG that I've never experienced, that and the create your own adventure part of it brings back memories of the books I read as a child. It mixes RPG/Card Game/Create Your Own Adventure so well, I am about half way through the story mode, have yet to touch the Endless Mode but I definitely will after I finish the story. I couldn't stop playing, I put 8 plus hours in straight, minus roughly 1 hour for a break I took to eat and watch a show.Basically how this game goes (its awesome) is you sit face to face with the guy who created the game essentially at a table, he opens his cabinet of boss enemies and you must take one boss out at a time. So each journey you unlock cards, weapons, armor, blessings etc etc that become part of your deck. You can build your deck between journies. One boss takes you through a journey where you'll face numerous enemies, mazes of death, merchants, people that need help, all kinds of things. You get a choice to whether or not you are good or bad or you will help or you won't. You'll be rewarded in some way, either way whether that's good or bad. That's the create your own adventure part, gives you control of what choices you make in the game and the consequences of those choices. It's very cool.What is also REALLY awesome is you actually do battle yourself when you come across enemies or a boss etc, the cards dont just animate the fight, you'll take control of your character and have to take on all the enemies yourself, it's really fun. So the character (which you can look at anytime in the inventory along with your other goodies/curses/blessings etc) will change his appearance based on what armor or weapons you have equipped. You can counter enemies when wielding a shield and get various items that do different things, different weapons, helmets, armor, braces etc that have different properties, it's quite cool.This game is worth every penny, I can't say enough about it, one of the best games I've played in a long while. I'm glad a friend of mine told me about it.			"

												This game is one of the games that must be done long long time ago.You remember that games on forums when you just post what happens when you cross river and you roll the dice to see if you fall down or cross river?Or you meet a devil and make exchange with him and get screwed on this exchange?So here is game that is not on forum but it's all nice graphical styled.Whenever you step on event card you need to choose if you failr or not.There are 4 cards that define if you suceed:big sucess,sucess,failure,huge failure.Fights with monster are RPG styled what is AWESOME because you can control your character when you fight,you just not see a text that your hero take -4 damage due to hit,you just fight with monsters and can dodge attacks and fight against monsters,not see text just fight.Our hero looks badass:beard,pony tail,and manly face like a real adventurer.Dealer narrative every single thing which is nice because thanks to this it's not just quiet card stepping.And last thing,when I lose like half hp due to events dealer just say:""Ha!"" and I was like:""F**K YOU B**CH I TRY TO WIN THIS GAME"" with I found hilarious.Pros:+Endless mode,you can see how good you compare to others.+2 phased game.Card walking phase which is text phase and chances and fighting phsae which is RPG styled combat.+You can choose by cards if you will suceed in event or failure which is good because it's not random.+Tons of weapons,armors,blessings,curses,rings,shields.+If you want you can either kite and poke enemies or rush to they and fight like berserker by repeadly countering all attacks.Yours choice+Traps give a little bit spice to game.It's not only boring fight against enemies in fight phase but also dodging traps sometimes.+Dealer talks to us in every stepping a card.Thanks to this stepping phase not boring us.+Our hero looks badassCons:-Should be more bosses for longer story mode.I really like story mode.-Bandit bosses and skeleton bosses looks similar to basic bandits and skeletons.-You can select encounters that will happen during game what kills a little bit fun.-Finishing blowing enemies is kinda akward by jumping to it,it's looks unnatural.Overall score strong 7/10.It could be better but it's good in this stage.It's need only a little polish.

												Starts off spectacularly, then turns into a grind-fest of horrible guessing games and 10 minute long fights that lead to failing events even if you win them (my hand still hurts after a Lost Island 2 fight with mutineers, almost 10 minutes vs the King of Dust, which I barely won with default equipment, only for the game to proclaim I failed the quest anyways). While the concept is splendid, the game becomes almost impossible after a while.I am afraid I cannot recommend this game in its current state.			"

												This game is based on a clever idea - a turn-based card game with mini-arpg battles mixed in.  But the gimmick wears off after a couple hours. Many of the ""chance"" card choices you are required to make with increasing frequency later in the game don't really seem fair, and the penalties for not getting lucky are very harsh.  While this is somewhat entertaining in the beginning of the game, it can be frustrating to the point of making the game unplayable later on. Overall, I wish the game had a lot more fighting, and a lot less hoping to get lucky through picking arbitrary cards.  This is really the only mechanic that gives the game replay value; in that you hope you won't get terribly unlucky to make it to the next level.			"

								This game is brilliant and I beleive it's only just began to scratch the surface of it's true potential.It's basically fable meets D&D meets a card game!The story is played out as different cards are placed onto the table, the further through the game you progress and the more cards you get the more random and wide spread the events will become, coming across less of the same card events in each playthough.I would hope that the game developers would put a 2 player co-op into the game which would be fun to play with friends. But this is not exactly a deal breaker.A workshop for this game with card creators for quest and dungeons would also be Great!Although the combat is slightly clunky the game is a very enjoyable experience.I would recommend buying this game even in it's Early access state, it's just good fun.

												Starts out promising enough; it's like a mixture of Thunderstone, a ""choose your own adventure"" book, and the combat from Arkham Asylum.  It's a rogue-like, but it's worth noting that there are checkpoints at the end of each ""stage,"" so death isn't as punishing as it is in other games.  The narration is great, and deck building and choices are initially fun and interesting.  The problem is that the game gets very repititious, very quickly, and the strategies that you employ in the early- to mid-game completely unravel when facing the last stage.  (I won't spoil why, but it suffices to say that luck becomes a larger factor than skill or strategy during the final stage.)  Overall, I don't regret buying it on sale, but I cannot recommend the game at full price.			"

												It´s not a game, it´s all about luck, luck and well luck. There are no tactics or something like that. Even if you are skilled enough to win every encounter without being hit a single time, you will still loose. Of Starvation or simple becouse the game wants you to die.The game looks well done the first hour or two, but sooner or later you will realise: You are not skilled oder unskilled, it´s all about luck and not even as fair or fun as classic gambling games.

												IMO it is sloppy. The game concept is fantastic, the graphics are nice. The camera angle can be very annoying. The luck you have with cards may not be too good. The price could be even cheaper. It is a fun game if you can snag it on a super sale. Its a bit too hard for me, the control seems a little off at times. Maybe it just needs a fix. As for now I'm moving on to another game. Sorry folks, this was a tough call. I really wanted to give it a thumbs up. I'm sort of leaning toward thumbs down ATM. Maybe if they give it a patch or two. The thumb down is for the wonky control.			"

												I like the concept of the game, but the game itself is not very fun to play. The deck building and storytelling is a cool mix, but then the inevitable combat that's like a bad version of the Prince of Persia or the Arkham games comes along. It feels like your character is slogging through muck and the prompts from enemies are comically easy to counter.If you like super casual games, this is a good choice for you.			"

								A very unique card game that transports you from the table into adventures/battles that are somewhat randomly generated by the cards that are dealt. The game itself oozes style and originality and is executed very well. I felt myself helplessly and gladly being drawn in by the great atmosphere, music, and voice acting that is top notch and very appropriate for the game.   I've only came across minor bugs as one would expect in an early release that were admittedly annoying at times. The game in its current state has an unrelenting learning curve that comes out of nowhere after the first few bosses. I also felt the combat tutorial was somewhat lacking as it didn’t explain everything you can do such as ground executions.    Other than these minor qualms I highly recommend buying it. I was very pleasantly surprised by how fun this game is to play and I look forward to future releases.			"

Games like 'Hearthstone' just don't hold my interest. But this is different and something I've not seen in a game before. It's brilliant, I love the way you play your cards which them spring to life during your journey and encounters. Having seen screenshots myself of the 3rd person battles I thought the action was all pre-rendered and AI controlled, but it's not. You take over the role of your character in awesome 3rd person hack and slash fashion! - For an early access game this is highly recommended!			"

												I got this game after watching Total Biscuit's review of it. Wish I could have gotten it when it was on sale, but it's definately worth the full price. I have to agree with him that the dealer is easily one of the best selling points. (The dealer is both creepy and entertaining.) The only misgivings I have seems to be the graphical options and that (my copy at least) seems to lock you into using a controller if you have one plugged into your PC. However, the controller doesn't limit gameplay. Combat is not overly complicated. Some have panned the game for it, but I don't see that as a drawback.			"

												Hand of Fate is a game I've been seeing around lately, hearing a lot of solid words from trusted sources and fellow gamers, and of course some harsh criticisms, which is to be expected, but the one theme that keeps popping up is that it is addicting as hell. Combining elements from card games such as Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering, board games like Dungeons and Dragons, as well as RPGs like Skyrim, Diablo, and The Witcher, this game has all the elements to be the meth of gaming, a blend of a lot of different things making for a hell of a drug, but is it fun? Let's find out, shall we?Gameplay: 93/100 A-As I mentioned in the intro, Hand of Fate is a mix of a lot of different things, taking the best aspects of each and nearly seamlessly melding them into one, a feat that is hard enough to do separately, let alone flowing from one to another, but it is an achievement that Defiant have successfully done. Playing through the cards and planning ahead with equipment, magic, traps, all the standards that you can find in other card games, but then the RPG side comes in a bit as you can trade with caravans, should you draw that card, and finally landing on the combat, which is fairly simple to get used to. Attack, blocking, countering, all can be done and the game does flow like water over river stones in the spring time.Audio: 94/100 A-The sound effects and music is also done very well. It was never intrusive or overwhelming, Calm when it needed to be and action packed elsewhere. The voice acting has to be the crowning jewel here, where listening to your ""trainer"" felt real. For example, leave the game playing during a turn or when picking cards, he may start babbling or criticizing you for taking too much time. It's an organic feel that I really welcomed and made me chuckle a few times. The combat sounds and ambience is also very well produced, a solid effort on this end.Visuals: 94/100 A-Hand of Fate is good to look at, even at the lowest settings. There is of course clipping issues here and there, but I feel like that's going to be an issue in gaming for at least another generation and a half. Anyways, the colors are all done well and placed in logical locations, things look like they belong as well as drawing inspirations from all the genres that are mashed together in the game: medieval fantasy, gothic dark ages, D&D, it all comes together quite nicely, giving Hand of Fate a distinct style. Content: 95/100 AThere are a LOT of cards to play with here, easily competing with other big dogs in the market, both old and new, couple that with the other elements of the game and you're into a lot of replayability, but with that also comes some repetitiveness, and while the latter is annoying, it is also expecting in a game that uses themes from other games which rely on such a large selection of options and randomness. But the game works well together, keeping me interested even when things became repetitive. It is something you come back just in case that awesome moment happens this time around and you get that ultra rare thing you've always wanted.Design: 96/100 A+Like I said, the game flows very well together. Everything is done in moderation and not one aspect of the game overwhelms or overpowers another and I think that is the key to Hand of Fate's popularity, despite the often complicated genres that it takes inspiration from. A testament to Defiant's understanding of the multiple elements they've taken from.Performance: 80/100 B-Now we get into the issues I ran into. While the game itself is brilliant in combining everything together, the technical side of things are a bit choppy. Again, this is from my experience on my machine, got it? The biggest issue I had, first, involved the Steam overlay glitching and remaining on the screen when I took screenshots. Another issue was often times during the loading of the combat scenes took ages to load, often making me think that the game had frozen, only to come alive suddenly. There was some detection issues with the combat as well, but that could just be my suckiness at said combat. Not to mention glitches here and there bugged me in many ways, but the game is good, so I just learned to ignore them and kept going.Verdict: 93/100 A-At the end of it all, you can't deny the strokes of brilliance in Hand of Fate. The developers picked and chose the right things from each genre melded them together, where they would be most effective and instead of falling flat, it stands tall, albeit a little shaky with a lot of polishing needed, it is still a great start. The potential for this game is through the roof.			"

												I don't write reviews often, but i started writing this for my friends on facebook and accidently reviewed it.So here is my very positive review.Guys, If you ever wanted a game that supports Australia in the game development industry. I cant stress this enough.GET HAND OF FATE.This game is amazing.Created by Defiant Development, this game mixs a table top card game with a top down action rpg.After the tutorial, you have to edit your deck (or use a reccomended preset) and in doing this you choose what encounters, shops, weapons, armor and enchantments will be randomly drawn throughout the game.These items get reset every game, but you add to the total cards in the deck. Which means you have wider variety to build a play deck with.Each floor consists of face down cards. These are encounters. You have to move your token across these, one after another, down the depths to find the boss at the end of the dungeon.This part is similar to Nethack.Each time you touch a new card, you have to decide how to deal with it.Be it scaling down a cliffside to reach a weapon or an angry mob wanting to steal your food.Resources!In this you have 3 resources.First, obviously, is your health. This is gained each time you move or take a heal action through an encounter. Maximum health can be gained or lost through different successes or failures. Lose all of this and you have lost the game.Second. Food.Food is used to move. Consuming 1 food per movement. There are events in this where you can lose or gain food, sometimes lose all of it too, very harsh as i learned.If your food has fallen to 0 then every movement will cost -10 health.Food is gained through combat, gain cards or shops.Third. Gold.What dungeon crawler would exist without the treasure?Gold is used to shop with, buy off bribes or charity through events.Gold can be stolen from you and you can also gain it through events or combat.Now, this gets better. because you have a full inventory.Head, Armour, Hands, Weapon, Shield, Trinkets.Lots of combos that do lots of things.Some weapons have elemental damage that do extra to different creatures, or less!.This can be found in treasure chests through events, given to you, bought, sold.These items are preset into the deck by the deck builder, but you dont just get them, you need to EARN them in the game.Combat is simple and short, but enjoyable.The dealer will select monster cards (or you do, depending on the event)These monster cards will say things like Four of Skulls or 3 of Dust.The 4 of Skulls will summon 4 Skeletons. 3 of Dust will summon 3 bandits.The combat now moves into a character control, no longer a card game but a top down action rpg, think of Diablo and you will be getting close.Combat is a little clunky, but nothing to make this game anything of any sort of shabby.Some weapons have abilities like exploding, gaining damage through combos, do more damage the less health you have, that sort of thing.Some shields can reflect range damage back and some trinkets will do things like throw 8 daggers around you, some will activate and give you gold-per-hit and some will give you temp poison.The goal of this is to kill all 12 bosses in the story mode, all with a varying range of tactics.So once again, Want to support Australian developers and get something worth while out of it?Hand of Fate.

												God I really wanted to put hours upon hours in to this game and then give it a big ol' thumbs up but I just can't.I was loving this game for the first hour of play. It's fun, unique and satisfying though the combat leaves very much to be desired. It's slow, clunky and what I like to call ""The poor man's arkham"" but after a smooth first hour I'm suddenly bombarded with constant crashes to the point where it has become unplayable. I read on the forums that windows users should select the ""Direct X 9"" option on launch as it might help with the crashes but it only made them worse. Instead of the game crashing, my entire system crashed and blue screened...twice.I haven't had a blue screen in a very, very long time. I take very good care of my PC, I make sure everything is always up to date software wise and it gets maintained and checked on a regular basis ,hence not having had any blue screens for a long damn time but in the space of twenty minutes I ended up having two while playing this game.PC SPecs:FX8350 Black16GB RamR9 290X Strix 8GBWindows 10I am beyond confused with this whole blue screen shenanigans (And judging by the forum I'm not the first to have had this issue when it comes to this game) and it's such a damn shame because I was really enjoying myself.[I wrote this review in December of 2016 and stopped playing. It's now February of 2017 and I have not had a single blue screen since I stopped playing this game. The game has an issue which causes your computer to blue screen and the only ""support"" the developers will give you is ""It doesn't cause blue screens""]			"

												It's a decent game, but the devs made some very apparent shortcuts in that outside of combat there is practically no animation except for flipping cards and a man waving his hands around.Still, the combat is solid if a bit ugly with a camera that is very lkely to hide enemies in the corners of the arenas you fight in.Progression in this game is the typical ""Throw it at the wall until the wall stops being there"" in that you can very easily jump through walls of cotton and silk but the moment you face a hedge of thorn bushes 2 meters deep except in random places, then the game stops being funny, unless you only play the game for the little fighting and a lot of lucky draws there is. Progression quickly halts very quickly, and I find it far more fun to play this game with the cheat engine on in the background. But the devs ♥♥♥♥ed up any ability to track numbers across games so anything more complicated then ""Add X gold/food"" is luck based at best.Would not buy if I had to choose again.			"

												This game is really innovative and nicely made. But you will never complete it.It is fair and balanced for majortiy of playthrough and you will have quite a fun if you like card game elements with action RPG style. Until you get to the end game. Then all fun will be replaced with frustration. To win this game you need mostly luck and good draw in cards. If you lack this, turn around and play something other as you will only ruing great experience that majority of game gives.			"

												almost everything in the game is awesome, the cards are really interesting and work really well. the soundtrack is nice, the enemies are really cheesy and generic but i think that's the point.its all ruined by ""mash attack and hit counter somtimes"" combat, though. i was playing on ""hard"" difficulty and played up to the 5th boss. the entire time i only got hit if i just wasnt paying attention. i've read it gets harder but honestly the combat is too boring for it to matter, anyway. if you enjoy ""mash attack and hit counter sometimes"" combat then you'd probably adore this game.as far as i can tell you can't turn off the counter indicators, either.

												The game’s real triumph is its ability to teach a rather obtuse sounding cards game with short but effective tutorialising, in order to quickly emerge the player in its bizarre concoction of Magic the Gathering, Fable and D&D. Rarely does a game strive for such lofty heights and exceed them, but Hand of Fate takes its incredible concept and absolutely knocks it out of the park.Full review here: http://www.gizorama.com/2015/computer/pc/hand-of-fate-review-a-royal-flush "

								Very cool concept of a game and really great blend of CCG and RPG action!  Loving this game especially at its price point.  Immersive and detailed.  Whoever does the dealer's voice is great as well.  A definite buy and the news is there will be additional DLC in a month after the gold release (tomorrow yay!) and more after that.  Also a possible sequel in the long run.  Great job and kudos to the devs and cant wait to see final product tomorrow!			"

												E aê, pessoal!!! Beleza???Vamos ver um pouco do que é Hand of Fate?Esse é um jogo que mistura deckbuilder e tabletop card game com ação em terceira pessoa, RPG roguelikish e pouquinho de sobrevivência.A apresentação do jogo e animações são elegantes e fluídas, e apesar de o gráfico não ser top, é melhor que qualquer coisa que já vi na engine Unity.A trilha sonora também é maravilhosa e esses 2 elementos provocam uma incrível imersão no jogo e no mundo criado pelo jogo.A variedade de cartas parece bem grande e interessante.A geração do ambiente de jogo é baseada nas cartas escolhidas pelo usuário mais as adicionadas pelo... cigano ou sei lá... mas o posicionamento aleatório faz com que cada partida seja única.O jogo mistura sorte e habilidade de uma maneira bem cativante.A parte de combate do jogo é um pouco fraquinha, com animações meio lerdas e pouca dinamicidade, mas a aleatoriedade do jogo acaba por adicionar um pouquinho ao combate com skills de armas e artefatos, além de efeitos passivos do equipamento.

								Very nice and original gameplay. Very promising game, gamepad requires some fixing.The game is very original and interesting. A combination of card games, where what you get is determined by what is in your deck and action RPG fights. It feels like a playing a Lone Wolf gamebook where your choices dictate few outcomes biased by your luck (damn!).At the same time, you do feel like you are just a pawn into the Dealer's hand and the lore is very appealing.I personally had to play with mouse and keyboard though the game is designed for gamepad: I still don't understand if the gamepad commands are laggy or if just don't activate in menus and fight.Fights and map loadings feel a bit laggy too.

												To all the negative reveiws based solely on how difficult this game is I say shame on you. This game offers challenge, reward and deceit, in many forms. What you put in is, quite literally, what you get out. If you make your choices wisely, whether with an encounter card itself or with what cards you put in you can succeed. I did. Yes i beat the main story, so dont buy into the whole "" it's too hard, the game cheats dont buy"" crap. \Games are meant to be hard.Now to less rants. If you enjoy dungeoun delves, this game is for you.If you like games of chance, this game is for you.If you like hack and slash, again this is for you.All of these without hours of grinding? Based solely on how you play and what you want?Then kudos, really for you.I wont give spoilers, all i will say, besides what I have said already, you will fail. You will die. It may take a while, but it will happen. This game is challenging but incredibly fun. Dont give up, run it through to completion. You will not be dissapointed.MURKA, 14 hrs 45% percent of acheivements.(more coming soon)			"

								Floor 3, do I chose to run from the angry mob and chance keeping all my remaing food but risk losing it all and thus succum to the subseqent inevitable starvation? Do I risk searching the remaining cards on a floor in hope of finding better equipment but risk losing everything trying to cross a river, leaving myself bare of armour and weilding only a rusty axe when it comes to challenging the deck boss? These are just some of the many difficult decisions you will face in Hand of Fate. Gripping dialogue and voice acting straight from the off. (The voice actor of the dealer is superb). Immense replayability and customisation through the use of the randomising deck system. Challenging bosses, enemies, events and decision making. I have not seen a game that can blend card based gameplay, with RPG elements such as your equipment, curses and 'artefacts', and actual in game combat. (One criticsm would be the combat system is a bit, well lots of rolling around randomly dodging enemies whilst mashing the LMB...But theres potential for a more substantial combat system in the future, furthermore this is only a minute criticsm in my opinion and should not overshadow the vast quality and diversity this game offers). Icant wait to see what the developers include in later patches and updates, perhaps character facial customisation? Some sort of tech-tree or research tree to go alongside the RPG aspect of the game? Hope everyone, developers included if you are reading this, found this a useful and honest review. Definately recommend getting your hands on this game!			"

												Mixing cards, D&D setting and Arkham Asylum-like combat couldn't go wrong now, could it?Short answer: Yeah, it can.Long answer:You get to build a deck of cards: Encounters, shopkeepers, stuff, curses, blessings and such.I really wanted to like this game. And I definitely did. And still sometimes do. But there are far too many things that keep me from fully recommending this to you. So, good things first, the setting is part of what I liked. The ambience the game sets is pretty cool and involving, while not too extravagant. The game master's taunts and comments might be redundant in the long run, but they're still well made and help the player get into the game a bit more. The way you unlock new cards and encounters with tokens, pretty cool too, makes you want to play more and more to unlock more cards and move deeper into the different storylines. The game system, nothing complicated, but making it simple is what makes it work : You move from encounter to encounter, spending one food at a time, healing a bit while doing so. As I said, it's simple, yet allows you a bit of planning when you look at which way you'll go.What could go wrong then?First, the encounter themselves: While having them randomly placed on the map makes sense and allows for replayability [GOOD RNG], most of them involve luck way too heavily to be amusing. You just pick a card and see if it's a success or failure, which can lead to frustrating events (looking at you there, devil's carnival) at worst and not so involving at best [BAD RNG]. I understand the need of randomness in such a game, but I wish I could have a heavier impact on it.And then the combat, oh my the combat. Arkham Asylum wasn't incredible and definitely was too easy, but it was nervous, fast paced, and pretty to look at (most of the time) because of its dynamic nature. Hand of Fate's one is just plain boring. At first it might seem enjoyable, because of the equipment possibilities and monsters that you imagine will come against you, but after two hours you've seen most of it. It's bland, slow-paced, not hard by any mean, unless the game's RNG decided to ♥♥♥♥ you up and stack everything against you (curses, loss of equipment...). Seeing that it's supposed to be an important part of the game, it's sad to see it fail to convey the atmosphere of epicness the games tries so hard to set.That being said, understand that this game is fun, but that you won't have fun for more than a few hours at best, therefore I don't recommend you buying it at full price. Wait for a sale, don't pay more than 10 bucks for this, really.tl;dr : Yes, I'd recommend this game, but for no more than a few bucks.			"

												""Very good and engaging for its price"" For a reasonably priced game this is intruiging, artsy and engaging.The graphics are pretty and the concept is pretty neat, mixing a dungeons and dragonesque rpg with a bit of hearthstone and then action elements aswell, as a genre mashup it does really well. It's graphically pretty for a small company game, I just wish there was a bit more variety in cards and characters you can play, that being said as of this current moment I am only half way through.Another brilliant part of this game is the voice acting of the mysterious sage, who I cant wait to hear more about, his taunting/ cryptic dialog is to definately draw you in further into the game and unlock the mystery of Hand of Fate.Can't really give it an out of 10 rating, all I can say is I enjoyed it for the time I have played it so far, its concept is very intruiging and I hope it does well.

												overall - great game, But do not buy it as a hack n' slash game.hand of fate offers a pretty unique experience, melding cards, adventure, combat, and a bit of role-playing. This game does not do one of those things terribly well, my opinion, some may argue. What it does do well is make the whole situation work, all of these elements together, how random and unsyncable they may seem, come together to make a really interesting experience. I would compare hand of fate to a very simple table top game, munchkin perhaps. You get a map made up of cards, which are adventures, meetings, shops, curses, and eventually - an exit from the current map. Each game has a certain amount of maps, and then you get to the end, where instead of an exit, you get a boss. So far, the boss has been an upgraded version of one of the vanilla enemies, with a twist. The combat is boring at best, but this is coming from someone who has difficulty capped 2 souls games. Honestly, I give the game about a 8 right now with the boring combat. The narrative of each game makes up for it, I would really almost prefer a table top combat to the hack n' slash that they have. more strategic, maybe involve rolls - but that might ruin the balance they got going, so i dunno. One thing it does need is a workshop for endless customizability. Also, I would be over the friggin moon if they figured out a way to make multiplayer work.			"

												Been playing games on Steam for nearly a decade now. It is June 25th, 2016, and this is the very first game I have ever requested a refund for.The game is trash, disguised as a treasure. It seems like a lot of fun on the surface, but once you get about 3 to 4 hours in, you realize that none of the decisions you make matter at all. You follow the same tired formula of ""choose to do nothing, and nothing happens, move on to the next card"" or "" choose to do something and unlock a token, which unlocks a new card"". Return to beginning of the loop. There is not a modicum of skill or involved, and very little decision making. Every ""success"" or ""failure"" is literally you drawing randomly from cards that say ""success"" or ""failure"". You can try to follow them being shuffled, and sometimes that results in success if the same card stays on top twice in a row... but really, it's just pure luck of the draw. Once you realize you're playing an RPG on rails, and your choices don't matter... it gets bad. When you then realize that it's just pure luck to hope you randomly pull the one ""success"" card out of four cards, so that you can advance the storyline for that one series of cards... it becomes absolutely, insanely frustrating. And that's an awful thing to feel, playing a low-key, deck-building RPG.The only good things I can say about it is that the production value is quite high. The writing is very good. The art is good. The voice acting for the dealer is excellent. The core idea of trying to merge these RPG, deck-building, action and rogue-like elements is really quite innovative and is what lured me in.Unfortunately, the gameplay just wasn't thought out in the long run. It is not fun to fail over, and over, and over again when there is absolutely no mechanism in your grasp to try to prevent it. It never goes well in a video game when you remove every semblance of control or input from the player's hands. At the end of the day, you'd be better off just clicking ""roll"" over and over on a random number generator. That's pretty much what's happening here.			"

												Fun concept, horrible execution. Game is interesting and enjoyable for about an hour or two but once you're past the first few bosses every run turns into a slow and tedious slog as each one adds more and more events that are basically just boring static debuffs that you don't get any opportunity to mitigate or avoid. Every time you finish or fail a run it sends you all the way back to what is essentially the title screen and you have to sit through a million unskippable animations and spam through a million clunky menus to start the next run. The dealer's voice acting is good and enjoyable until hour two when you realize you've heard the exact same lines twenty times already and you're sick of constantly being forced to wait to make actions until he finishes saying the entirety of his 15 second tangent about fate which wasn't even interesting the first time.The combat just gets worse and worse as the game goes too, they throw more and more guys in but the arenas are all tiny and there camera is fixed so you get tons of guys attacking you from onscreen and all the enemy types and especially the later ones have terrible animations that all look the same but are randomly unblockable. There's also really inconsistent bullet time slowdown to try and make your attacks look cool but it just makes your character look like an idiot as he slowly floats through the air swinging his axe while enemies just walk around and set up attacks at normal speed in the background. The combat system is standard Arkham-style Simon Says stuff but it's the clunkiest version of any game to use it and nothing about it feels good or consistent.			"

												Updated: 7th July, 2015I love this game and want to have the Australian developers' kangaroo babies.The game mechanics are difficult to explain, since I've never seen any game like this. You get to pick half of the cards that will appear in the game ( your favourite weapons, armour and positive encounters ), the computer picks the other half ( rusty weapons, monsters, curses and negative encounters ).The computer shuffles your deck with his deck, this creates true procedural generation. No two games will ever be the same. The cards are placed, so as to simulate floors in a building and corridors.This is Kenuty's excellent Early Access gamplay video:

			Views: 1,235		

			Hand of fate play for steam This is pretty raw footage of me playing with a mic and actually talking about the game and playing it, so please excuse the sensitive mic noises and the bad play, wasn't...		

The combat for the first few quests consisted of simple attack and parry but scaled up to ""God of War 1"" meets ""Golden Axe"" with: tumble, shield bash, magical weapons and magical artifacts.There are 12 different quests. It took me 20 hours to finish three quarters of the game ( at which point I had only unlocked a little over half of the equipment cards and half of the encounter cards ie. the game is massive ). It took me another 20 hours to finish the last three missions because they are brutal. I highly recommend this game to hardcore gamers!If you want to make the game easier or harder, there is a ""Wildcards"" expansion that will do that: The voice narration is eloquent. I thought that it was narrated by Jeremy Irons but it was voiced by Anthony Skordi. The dialogue is immersive and teaches you the game mechanics on the fly, as you encounter the different cards.Northern Lion: ""Let's Look At: Hand of Fate!""

Second half of the game u struggle a bit more though not nearly enuf.Aside from that game has a bit of strategic feel to it, is somewhat atmospheric, feels pretty fresh and lets you do different things. Combat on the other side feels clunky after Shadows of Mordor and Batman.Verdict: is worth couple of evenings or untill u unlock all cards, replay value is really low for a roguelike just coz when you know what every card game goes straight to luck on cards/skill in combat and looses element of surprise.6.5/10			"

												Addicting.... very VERY addicting.I asked the forums if the game has any solid replayability and I believe it does, a lot of it actually.  But the review..The Good:Addicting game play, obviously I mean who doesn't like card games and rpgs and dungeon crawlers and blah blah blah you get up grades that do different things and they do them well.The gear assortment is pretty neat, lots of different piece of gear that have little thing here and there like extra life if you heal or a sword that can shoot frost all at the touch of a button.The random encounters are also really cool from the Elf Maiden to the Priest or perhaps A fallen hero, lots of different encounters with rewards.there is a lot more but I have just scratched the surface.The Bad:Not really BAD but kinda annoying so be ready but some random encounters are BAD like falling rocks... damn rocks I mean you would figure the guy could dodge a falling rock but NOPE! you get 1 chance to succeed in this actiong to avoid the falling rocks and if you don't it hurts... A LOT.FOOD!!!! for the love of everything everywhere bring FOOD! if you have a chance to get food some where TAKE IT omfg if you run out you are now running on Health until you die, try fighting a boss with 14 health I had to change my underwear.On the subject of random encounter some of them have pretty bad optins as far as how much you can succeed like 1 success and three failure or even one Huge failure, it makes the game interesting but still fresh into the game it can hurt a lot.Difficulty ramps up pretty quick.. once you get past the first gate things become more dangerous and you can die.. like dieing in a trap maze to a bush -.- yeah there is a defining moment for you you died to a damn bush a BUSH! ANY WAY...All in all this is a GREAT game and I am REALLY REALLY glad I got it, I hope the game take off and adds more content because wow... I love it and I have like maybe a few hours at the time of writing this.  So if you have any doubts DON'T this is worth the money 100%.. now excuess me I have a bush to go take care of... giggity!.

												Despite being a fun time for several hours unfortunately I cannot recommend this game due to some bugs which causes the game to freeze while loading monster encounters. I've played through 3/4th of the campaign but this issue becomes more apparent in the last quarter, and also in endless. The gameplay itself is solid, but I feel the chance of success is a bit too random (at least in hard mode) and unlike other games where you have other ways to offset chance (for example multiple ways of dealing with enemy encounters or pathing through a dungeon depending on resources), the only real way to succeed is getting incredibly good at monster encounters. Deck customization doesn't influence the game much when most cards follow the success = food, failure = pain card + battle formula with roughly equal chance for either. Additionally, the lack of food forces the player to rush to the exit more often than needed.			"

								I usually avoid Early Access games because I'd rather make sure I'm getting a whole game and to avoid spoiling anything. I picked this up as part of a bundle because Extra Credits said it was worth the look for its uniqueness alone. Boy were they right. What they left off was how delightfully fun it is. It takes what could be a boring basic premise and dresses it up in just the right way to make it fresh and engaging. The voice acting (and the writing) is nigh flawless. The visual design is never stunning, but always full of loving detail. The setting sits right between being broad enough to feel deep and repetitive enough to feel symbolic. What's more it's always explored indirectly as a side benefit of progressing through the game mechanics itself. Rich with theme, a pleasure to explore, and with more to come, you'd be hard pressed to find a better choice for that distraction game you've been needing.			"

												Maybe I just didn't play this game long enough, but I didn't really like it. I feel like the combat is clunky and as a result I found I was just clicking wildly throughout the fights in an effort to constantly interrupt enemy attacks. The card aspect is unique, but this is probably the fastest I have ever decided I didn't like a game. If I do give it another chance, I'll modify this review if I change my mind.			"

								It's an interesting mix of deckbuilding, exploration, and action.  Build your equipment and encounter decks, then explore the randomly dealt map of encounter cards you put together, hope to earn equipment from the equipment deck you built, and use it all to hack'n'slash your way through baddies and bosses to unlock more cards!  It doesn't sound like it'd mesh but it really works well.			"

Early Access Review
								Being a person who like procedurally generated games, this of course immediately got me interested when I saw it.At it's base this game is a part RPG, part action combat game, slight part deckbuilding game.The game is broken into adventures which get longer as you progress and unluck the next adventure. Before embarking you can put the cards you have into the encounter and equipment decks which will be used during the run. Some cards are locked for the specific adventure, some cards you may not know the effect of until you've encountered them in game at least once. For some adventures there are special circumstances like more damage from projectiles or taking damage if you carry too much gold at a time.Once you've started the game, the narrator will deal out cards to form the dungeon floor you're on. Either your target is on this floor, or there's a stairwell to go deeper. You move one card at a time either horizontally or vertically using food as you go. Each card is an event, some with just text, others with battles. It does lend a good feeling to this being an adaptation of a card game and you're playing against the deck out to kill you.If you enter battle, the world changes into 3D for a battle sequence flowing a bit like the Batman games or Asassins creed, though without the vertical element to it. Initially the combat feels clunky, maybe it was just the state I played it in, or maybe it owes to the fact that I didn't get a shield until later and didn't realise there was a dodge roll button either. The combat can be a bit tricky to see at times, but otherwise feels very satisfying connecting with your mace or warhammer.In all this is a nice game with a bit of randomization. It carries the atmosphere of playing an engrossing cardgame quite well, and breaks up the text events with a robust battle system. It gets rather tense when you're down to one food hoping you'll run into a merchant or a treasure chest with food in it, and it can really ruin your run when you have little health left and run into a tough battle you were hoping to avoid till you'd regained more health.As for negatives: There is some text to read in this game, so if you dislike reading, skip it. Maybe down the line it'll all be narrated, but for now it isn't.Also you will encounter the same card and thus even several times over your playthrough. If you're the person who want new stuff constantly, this might put you off. As it is, once you know an event by heart you can usually click past it and get the effect you'd like. And of course you can alter the frequency by removing some of them from your deck if you so desire.The camera can be a bit tricky in the action sequences. I only found it got in the way of fighting once or twice, but if you're the kind of person who demands manual camera control or perfect viewing angles, this is not the case here.Lastly: I played this game using an XBox 360 controller, it works quite well. I don't know how well a keyboard and mouse setup would fare, but so far I've not found any ranged weapons so the 8-directional movement afforded by Keyboard should be sufficient if done well. Just know I have not tested this.			"

												Hand of fate is an adventure where you explore scenarios based around a deck of cards, find items, complete puzzles, and when it comes to fighting, you go into a 3rd person action type game. While the mechanics are cool and unique, it unfortunately falls flat with fairly boring, unsatisfactory battles, and slow exploring filled with simple decisions. I would only give it a try if you enjoy quirky new games, and it is on sale.			"

												This game is good...not great. Hopefully with some dev tweaks - it could be really excellent.It's very innovative and well done. Graphics are pleasant, the concept is refreshing and the execution is...well...it's ok.Some of the positives:1) Great concept. This is a card game and a button masher. It's not an RPG. There's no levelling of your character, no stats to decide in which to invest, no classes, no abilities.  It's a card game that unfolds into button mashing sequences based on the cards that are randomly drawn. The mix of card and action elements combined with a fantasy/D&D type setting are neat and are done well.2) The game is polished. The graphics are nice, the voice acting is very good, the presentation of the encounters are well done, etc. It's a well put together game with nice artwork, GUI, sounds, etc.Some of the negatives:1) The cards PART 1. For me , I dislike the card designs greatly. The devs chose to go with a basic brown card with black text - and it's drab. The rest of the game is graphically very colorful and interesting. I realize the card design is going for an old parchment feel - but it just seems uninteresting to me. I could have done with some interesting edge work, slight color tints, or edging...something. There are tons of card games out there and the cards themselves are always something of great time and effort in the design , sometimes even with collector editions, gold versions , etc. 2) The cards PART 2. For some reason, the devs thought it would be interesting to ""lock"" cards. When you get them, you don't know what they do until you come across them in your journey. This makes the whole part where you get cards at the end of your journey nearly pointless. When you complete a card/journey, you can get a token , and at the conclusion of a journey your tokens are exchanged for cards. The cards turn over on your screen and all you can do is look at the title and picture and wonder what they do....unless it's something you already unlocked. Perhaps this is fun to others and not to me, but I compare to Hearthstone - when you open a new pack - you can instantly read the description of the card - and start understanding if you should be excited about it or not. For a portion of the game where I feel getting new cards should be very rewarding and exciting - it's not. It's actually quite tedious as I have to turn in all my tokens, get my cards (which I don't know what they do) and that leads me to #3.3) Deck building. The same issue rears its head in building your deck. You can have many cards that are locked - that you don't know what they do - but if you want to know what they do - you put them in - hope to draw them during a journey - and hope you like it. That's really not a design choice that is rewarding to me. 4) Help. The game is easy to grasp once you play - but at the start - nothing is explained - and there is no good on screen help. An example are the tokens. It wasn't at all clear that a token was on the card, and that upon completing that card - you get the token - and that at the conclusion of the journey and beating the boss - that you get all the tokens you collected along the way and turn them in for cards. It also wasn't clear initially that you lose food each time you move, or gain health each time you move. You learn this super fast, but a tiny popup or something would be good. In fact, there's a couple different token shapes - still not sure the differences between them all.5) Easy + Repetitive. The game is fun, but so far, it's very repetitive. After just a couple journeys - I've run across the same cards over and over. It's also the same pattern - card, battle...card, battle. The battles are also the same for me...roll, x,x,x....roll, x,x,x....roll,x,x,x.....win.  I'm about half done with the game, maybe it gets more complex , but so far -it hasn't.In summary, it's a neat game...it's solid. There could be more done with the cards and the deck building to make it more interactive, but its repetitive and the card element isn't rewarding enough to compensate.Update: Saw there is DLC 1 month after release - so , since game is decent, but was on the fence, am going with not reccomended since DLC immediately after release is a money grab.

												If you want a card game don't buy it because the combat system ruins the whole game. In the last part the so called ""Scales"" are overpowered with their shield and the combat is just frustrating against them because you need 1 hour to kill all of them in 1 fight... and if you have no luck to get better weapon... impossible.Without this unbalanced combat system this game would be very nice.

												This game is so close to being great. Sadly, it rather misses the point of a deck-building game and actually gets worse as the game continues, getting harder while providing no tangible way to compensate for that with its mechanics. You have no true control over your deck, the odds of drawing anything, or any way to build a real strategy with your cards, as you're restricted to certain card minimums with no way to modify the variance in your favor. It's a fantastic idea for a game I'd like to see done better in the future.			"

												Great idea for a game, but unfortunately, the more you play, the more frustrating little things that didn't seem too terrible at the beginning become.  The biggest failure is the combat system.  Being able to use your mouse to control the direction you move would be great, but instead you're limited to A,W,S,D as though you're just a piece on a chessboard.  That doesn't work so well when you're surrounded by bosses and add ons in a tight space.  I saw some of the unlockable achievements being to fight X number of battles without taking any damage.  Yeah, right.  I'm all for things being more difficult the more I progress, but as others have commented, the difficulty spike soon makes the frustration outweigh the enjoyability factor far too quickly.  I've tried to love it, but the more I play, and the further I move along, the more likely I am to delete this game, count my blessings I got it on sale, and find other, more enjoyable games to play.  Hopefully the developers will read through some of the negatve reviews and continue to revamp the game.  Great idea for a game, but still needs a lot of work to deservite its ""Mostly Positive"" rating it currently has.			"

												Quite a fun little mismash of genres - Up to a point. Hand of Fate lays deckbuilding card games, roguelikes, action brawlers and choose-your-own-adventure books onto the table and shuffles. The end result feels surprisingly fresh and innovative, even though none of the individual components would really stand on their own.Initially, the game works wonderfully because of its brisk pace and laidback feel - There seems to always be something new around the corner and the game is just a joy to play. However, as the end draws close, the difficulty is suddenly amped to eleven and the game turns into a grind. During the last few rounds the deck is so stacked against you that even with immaculate play, you can still lose terribly.Yes, I understand that the game is a roguelike and you're supposed to die a bit, but going from not dying at all for 90% of the game to losing twenty times in a row is just poor balancing and design. A shame really, since with a bit less punishing difficulty curve Hand of Fate would've been a surefire recommendation. It delivers innovation, fun and respectable production values, but eventually turns into a plain old Three-card Monte.			"

												Hand of fate is a fun Roguelike, with a mix of RPG-style choices and beat-em-up combat. I really wish I could enjoy this game more. Sadly, for how fun this game is, it comes with a horrible sense of helplessness. So much of this game boils down not to your choices or your reactions, but pure blind luck. If you're lousy at picking out the right random card, you can easily be almost dead before you ever reach a combat section, where you have some actual control. It almost feels like you have no control at all, but that ""almost"" keeps me coming back for more.Pick it up on sale, if at all.			"

												I wanted to really love this game, but I feel like there is some big room for improvement.First, I must say that the concept is great. It makes for interesting and variable playthrough. I think with a few improvements this could easily turn into one of my favourite games. So the big problem I had is that the combat became very dull and one dimensional about halfway through the game. I felt like as soon once the number on enemies faced in each combat scenario got high enough I ended up just tapping the counter key constantly and could not do much else, and without a shield the was no hope of completing more than a couple of combat scenarios.The deck also started to feel unbalanced partway through the game, which I suppose added to the difficulty, but it seemed like too many cards had a 75% failure or epic failure chance with signifcant consequences and samll chance of reqrd, which was frustrating at times.I think encorporating a bit of dungeon crawling could really liven things up as well. Rather than just being thrust into an arena for each combat, creating a larger level where you could approach the enemies and the combat situation in multiple ways would really improve the gameplay.I am a bit torn about recommending or not recommending this game; I still think it is an interesting concept and worth a playthrough, but there is definitely a lot of room for improvement.

												This game was almost good.I understand that this is not a AAA game. I'm fine with the memory hogging, the stuttering in fps here and there, even ok with the combat not being that fluent when a lot of attackers are attacking at the same time. Even semi-ok with a few of the button prompts in combat popping up a bit late (after it's to late to actually block).I'm a bit less ok with some other stuff. Like the camera, seriously why even make the game 3d if you can't control the camera (also WAAAAAAAAAY to zoomed in)? Just make it isometric and use 2d graphics a lot less work same result, probably better. Why can't you skip past some of the shuffling, I was removing event cards that I almost liked just cause I don't want go through 4 pick this card events...Even with all the above I would have recommended this game to my friends, cause I enjoyed playing it (on hard) progressing through the sometimes quite unlucky near insta fail runs... until...Last boss 1 shot insta fail QTE from 90 hp with heavy armor. ♥♥♥♥ off. There are several games with instant kill QTE, none of them without continues/saves or similar and none without it being a regular part of the game mechanic. Tossing this in on the final boss is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm sorry but I will not be buying any more games from you guys, cause I can't in good conscience support game design like that.Whomever made this design choice shouldn't be designing games.P.S. I actually made the QTE (but still died from it).			"

												Unfortunately I have to give this game a thumbs down, for now.  tl;dr - It does a lot of things well, and starts off fun, but the difficulty gets extreme enough to make the game unplayable as anything but a suicide simulator.It frustrates me that I have to give a negative review to this game, because it was really fun when I started playing.  The animations were nice, combat was fun, the voice acting was great.  It was a really well polished random adventure generator game.  The basic mechanic of the game is that encountering cards generates an encounter, whether combat, puzzle, story, what-have-you, and completing the card will unlock that card's token, which will in turn unlock more cards to add to future decks.  It gives a good incentive to try to encounter many cards and figure out how to unlock more.  Quite cool.  As you progress in the game, unlocking more cards, you will also encounter bosses.  Beating them unlocks the next boss card, and after you beat enough bosses you will unlock an artifact that gives you some bonuses but will also make the game harder.This is the point where the game goes wrong for me.  The difficulty increases introduced by the artifacts make the game virtually impossible by the end.  It was not unusual for me to start a game and the very first card would be a combat against a prior boss, 9 of their minions, on a trapped battlefield with an accompanying totem.  There were so many high powered threats my brand new out of the box adventurer had no chance to win.  What makes it worse is that there's no going back.  Once those difficulty spikes are unlocked, they affect the whole game, retroactively.  If I go back to the very first boss of the game, my first encounter on that level might be the aforementioned impossible fight (and was, the time I tried).  The fun of the game, of running around kicking bandits in the face and solving problems for townsfolk became overshadowed by a constant string of deaths brought on by unwinnable fights.  There's an easy mode that gives the player some benefits, but activating it disables achievements (gotta punish those filthy casuals) and you can't access any of the other character archetypes in the game, which locks out almost all of the games replayability.  Currently the only solution to get rid of the difficulty spikes is to use the 'Erase Progress' feature, which you don't realize until it's too late.  Now, after playing for 12 hours, I'm forced to decide to either erase everything I've accomplished or give up because the game is unplayable.  Neither of those choices make any sense, and are a big part of the reason I can't recommend this game.  There's a great premise here, and the underlying system is really, really cool, but it becomes difficult to the point of impossibility and I've got better things to spend my gaming time on than dying forever.  Should the devs put in a way to disable the artifacts, or otherwise customize the difficulty of the game in a way that doesn't lock out every other character option, I will revisit this review and hopefully change it to a positive.

												Hand of Fate is a silly, pretentious game that confuses originality with bad ideas. No matter how charming the presentation may be, the core of this game is rotten and bland.Everything you do in this game is connected to combat. The equipment you collect, the spells you learn and the encounters you get through. Which would be perfectly OK if that combat was any good.You will fight a bunch of monsters in tiny arenas over and over again, using a dementia inducing combat system.If you do die, you will die due to either RNG from encounters (-50% HP and similar events), or to traps. Not because of your skill level.Don't get fooled by lets plays, it might seem like fun after the first hour or two, but it's really not.			"

												Original concept, but too many flaws.The camera point of view is absolutely horrible, up to the point of being unplayable sometimes, especially in the trap maze and with large enemies.The game's difficulty curve is broken. The first 3 tiers are extremely easy, the last tier is suddenly hard. One wrong curse card can nearly instantly kill you.Too many encounters are based on luck, instead of skill. Not quite like rolling the dice, but close to it.Certain playthroughs become impossible to complete because of the above. Nothing you can do about it, except retrying and hoping for better luck.Equipment is not balanced. The most important piece is the weapon. Almost more important than the other equipment pieces added together. Also, most of the blessings are of little use. "

Early Access Review
								This game has a lot of good ideas and some really good implementation, and up until you beat the Jack of Plague you will be having a great time. It only goes downhill from there. Mages that block indefinitely, ranged attacks that are impossible to avoid, and prepare your butt for the Blacksmith card which contains two boss level monsters that spawn together with 4 enemies each, which do around a sixth of your life in damage with each attack.This game needs a LOT more balancing before it's ready for public consumption. I too was fooled by the idea and flowery reviews. Turns out I don't have the stomach for overpowered enemies and unbalanced messes.			"

												I love the way this game looks, I love the idea, I love everything about this.... But the combat is just garbage. It really ruins the game. I can put up with the rng and the sometimes cheap situations, but the combat is soooo bad.It locks you into tiny arenas with 20 enemies to fight and usually a boss with un counterable attacks and 12 environment hazards screwing you over at every turn.If they put in an alternative option to the combat, or just remove it completly, this will become an instant recomend. Until that happens (which i doubt it ever will), I can only say dont buy it.			"

												Other reviews are more in depth and they echo my thoughts, so I'll be consiseThe atmosphere is 100% perfect. It draws you into the world magnificently. The dealer is perfect.. however that's not the whole game. What destroys this atmosphere is the gameplay..Once you're about 2/3rds into the game you'll realize why people left negetive reviews. The combat remains simple and unrewarding, however the monster HP goes up as you get better items to your deck. However you don't start with those items, you have to be lucky enough to find them. So monsters are now punching bags, and every time you run into a combat card you sigh from exhaustion. The end game is just brainless masochism (and I've beaten the castlevania, ninja gaiden, and Ghouls n Ghosts trilogies). You lose because of dice rolls, and the odds aren't in your favor. The final battle is depressingly boring- just a repeat of old bosses and the final boss is just a QTE.I gave the developers months to change it, but they haven't. I recommended this game to many of my friends and I honestly regret it once I saw the full game.			"

												A great idea ruined by frequent, lifeless, repetitive, and bland combat, ripped directly out of action games such as Batman. I'm actually disappointed, as the card generated gameplay and deck building features are unequivocally unique. If they could change up the combat so it feels as unique as the rest of the game, or better yet remove it altogether, I'd recommend this. Buy it on sale for <$5 so you can experience such an entertaining concept, without ending up disappointed that it fell so flat.			"

												I was looking forward to playing Hand of Fate after reading some of the reviews. This wasn't a gameplay style I'd really indulged in before and when people have a lot of love for a game I'm immediately drawn to a title; unfortunately after a short dabble I was feeling left out of the group of people who seem to have nothing but positive feedback to add to a list of admirable blurbs.It may be one of those things where I just don't enjoy or even get the style and my intention isn’t to deride the reviews of people who seem to adore Hand of Fate. Unfortunately I was left with a feeling of dull disappointment and a small hole in my pocket after just over an hour of learning the mechanics. Don't get me wrong I'd happily pay my last cent for something enjoyable and the concept is refreshing but everything else was just overwhelmingly average. Gameplay was OKAtmosphere was OKIt looks OK Controls were OK (if not a little clunky)The music and narration are well put together with the aid of a great fantasy style voice actor but even after just over an hour play time the gameplay quickly became repetitive and irritating. I so wanted to love this game; generally if I’m excited by something I’ll be anxious to return to it or navigating obsession but the idea of having to return to this does feel like a bit of a chore.

												Would you like a game that combines deck building like Magic and hack and slash like diablo meets streets of rage?  Well so would I and this game falls far short of the mark.  The deck building is pretty pointless as there seems to be no strategy to it at all.  There are no synergies to be exploited so what's the point?  All it does is give you the space on the board to play and some equipment that the RNG will deem fit to annoint you with or screw you with.Then you have encounter cards that have you picking between four cards with success or failure.  This is such a lame feature I have no idea how it got into the final game.  Maybe somebody is a big 3 card monte fan or played persona 3 too much.Then you have the combat which basically entails whacking a couple guys, some dodge rolling and the occaisional counter telegraphed by the giant green symbol above the enemies head.  Wow.  Excitement it is not.  They try to spice it up with throwing some traps in the levels but all that does is make the combat even more tedious.  I beat some boss called the Queen of Dust with a rusty axe  (thanks RNG) by just running around in circles and then just whacking her after her unblockable attack.  It makes fighting the lamest enemies in Dark Souls seem like Swan Lake in comparison.So let's say you die during a level.  Well you get to keep any cards you get and then try it all over again.   Great.  It's a grindy game as well.  Sorry guys, the actually combat portion of the event is not fun enough to warrant any sort of grind.  Maybe if you made the levels bigger and it were more like a streets of rage type level (waves of enemies) instead of an arena level based upon a whack and roll mechanic it may have been more fun.tl/dr  Not all new ideas are good.

												This game blew my socks off... for the first 4 hours. Then it all came to ""Ooo. this boss can summon a cannon."" As a long-term investment of your time, Hand of Fate lacks in repeatably entertaining and engaging content, as well as giving you less of a satisfactory, job-well-done feeling when you finish a level as when you build your first house in Minecraft. This may not apply to all people, I realize, considering that, for me, this game was the first deck-builder I have ever played. Still, this game gets boring after about 8 hours of gameplay, leaving you unwanting to finish the whole game and yet feeling like you haven't finished the job. Still, those first 4 hours were fantastic.6/10 For those first 4 hours.			"

												The artwork is very pretty.  That's about the only positive thing I have to say about this game.It is *intensely* boring.  If you want to make a card game, make a card game.  If you want to make an action combat game, then do that.  What you have here is a very mediocre card game and an extremely mediocre action combat game put together.  If they had given up one concept they might have had enough resources to devote to the other to make it good.Here's how it works, you build a deck of equipment, bonus cards and encounters.  And then the game master lays some encounters on the table face down and your game piece ""walks"" across them, you pick the next card to walk on, and frequently you have only one choice.  Each encounter is either a choose-your-own adventure style multiple-choice question with a bit of random chance thrown in, or a ""battle"" if you can call it that.  Each battle is a mouse mashing clickfest.  The mechanics are stunningly bad and you can't even rotate the camera which is very annoying because some of your opponents will run off camera where you can't see them.That's pretty much it.  Card after card after card, monotonous battle after monotonous battle, all accompanied by the narration of the game master, whose mouth is masked but unfortunately not gagged.  The lines are delivered by a capable voice actor, but they are so vapid, uninspired, and ultimately irrelevant that eventually they just become annoying noise that you have to sit through.Sadly, there is no ""shut up"" button in evidence, maybe somewhere in the options?In any event I only played about a half hour or so... if you're bored in 30 minutes it's a really bad sign I figure.  Anyway, I guess it's not a game for me, and listening to other people rave about it, I am clearly in the minority. You may enjoy it, I recommend going on youtube and watching someone else play it for an hour.  If after that you are still interested, you'll probably love it.			"

												The critical foundation of any fantasy card game is the strategic use of cards. It's the development of your own customized deck. Combining cards in your customized deck to provide multipliers in combination with other cards, for use against a specific opponent. Hand of Fate is the most perfect name for this game because literally there is no strategy in developing your own deck, it's all left to Fate.Issues-Right off the bat, getting the chance to pull an equipment card is so rare, the whole point of having a customized deck is almost useless. The default size of your customized deck grows every level, decreasing the chances of you pulling any one card. For instance, I believe the start deck size is near 20 cards and since the chance of getting an equipment card to pull is less than once per level, this means the chance of pulling any one card is less than 5%. It's almost as if the dev's intentionally made the user deck larger as you advance levels, as a way to nerf the effectiveness of the cards and having a customizable card deck, in an attempt to make the game more difficult and stretch the game out. If this is the case, it's a bloody shame because its sacrificing crutial gameplay in an attempt to balance. If you guys want to play a really good card game then I suggest going to Pokemon or Hearthstone. There is a reason they are so popular because they are REALLY REALLY well done.			"

												I really want to give this game a positive recommendation. Its innovative card / action battle structure has all the makings of a totally addictive and fun experience. I want more cards, want to find out what they do, and am on the edge of my seat with every move forward onto the next encounter.But there are two really big flaws, which I suspect will limit how much time I put into the game. The first is a clunky and sometimes non-intuitive interface, with lots of unnecessary and repetitive micro-pauses. Every time you hit a merchant, you have to wait for a few seconds as the game transitions to the same 3D rendering of the merchant cart, before you are allowed to get on with the transaction. Fine the first time, really annoying by the 20th time. Ditto with shuffling the cards before making one of the game's very frequent 4-hidden-card choice routines.The second big flaw is the tactical combat. It just feels fuzzy, with a lack of precise control over your character that it already turning me off. It's not like Diablo 3, with it's crisp and immediately responsive controls. It's more like playing Diablo 3 drunk while wearing ski mittens. I would have preferred a crisp isometric 2D action sequence, or even a turn-based battle approach, rather than the sluggish and woozy 3D battles here. Maybe some fine tuning is all that's needed to turn this into a very fun game. For now, though, it's not going to be on my play a lot list.			"

												This game is repetetive, and so overpriced. The combat is a snoozefest and the graphics are subpar for a game released in 2015. The only decent part of the game is the board-game aspect where decision-making is a factor and earning cards and coins is semi-rewarding. Other than that, this game has way too much to improve upon before being worth anywhere near the full cost. I got it on sale for 50% off and I still can't say it was anywhere near money well spent.

												This is a case of a great idea with a poor execution. In general, the cards seem to be poorly planned for how they will actually affect the player - but that is the least of this games problem. The one, huge, fatal flaw of this game is the combat. It is the worst combat/action of any game I've played in a good while, and for a game that seemingly without rest throws combat at you all the time, this isn't good. This isn't good at all.It's a matter of 'press Q to block', and 'left click to attack', without the ability to use the mouse to choose directions - yes, they didn't even manage to implement something as simple as that. The camera is also set, so you can't really turn the angles to get whatever perspective you want.Though to be fair, the game isn't exactly terrible... I'm just... Dissapointed. I read the warnings, I ignored them because it looked interesting, and I paid the price.			"

I did not care about what the dude was saying. Let the game pick the cards for me. All I wanted was to have the painfully long animation (which you cannot skip) to be over. I mean imagine playing poker but the dealer takes nice 5 minute shuffle each time the game begins...jees.. Found myself clicking as fast as I could to skip the animation where the hero pops-up for the battle, maybe the keys are bindable (spacebar??) but I kept clicking fast as if my life depended on it (maybe it was from being bored to death).  You can always click the skip button - I think clicking is faster.Great looking game I just wish the developers played it atleast 12 times before saying ""Yup all those cut scene / animations between the meat of game are about the right length"". Game is goregeous but there is no depth - unless all you care about are beautiful animations. Most encounters and I know they are early-on game levels -- where over in less than a minute for me. Beautiful game poor execution - I enjoyed the repetative battles more than the card mechanics. @ Dev Learn from hearthstones - don't just reinvent the wheel.Good talk on GDC by the way.			"

												Cool concept; limited entertainment value.I purchased this game after reading a number of positive reviews because I was intrigued by the concept. I enjoyed playing it for approximately one hour, at which point the novelty wore off. The game became extremely repetitive and offered few, if any, chances for succeeding because of strategy. Combat is a little clunkly and not enjoyable. I found myself getting agitated every time I encountered a combat situation not because it was difficult and I didn't know if I was going to survive, but because I had no desire to endure yet another few minutes of spamming the left mouse button, q key, and space bar.Quite frankly, there's not much left to say other than after your 60 minutes of enjoyment you will experience a prolonged bout of depression stemming from the money you just wasted on this game.

												Not sure why this game is so popular, you can unlock all the cards and switch up the campaign. But honestly it does an extraordinary job of boring you. Bland combat with no depth, the main campaign? feels exactly the same the whole time. If you want this game, make sure you get it as cheap as possible.			"

												Game is not an RPG, Card Game, or Roguelike.  I originally had a different negative review up for this game, (one of the few, i know) and was immediately met with response from the dev offering me a refund.  I mean, thats awesome.  I neglected to take the refund simply because he offered.  With the success of the game i doubt he would have missed my 24.99 but if he was nice enough to do that, ill be nice enough to let him keep it.  I still think this game is terrible, repetitive and packed with misleading user-tags, lol. BUT i will be looking for the next prject from these devs.  EA was smooth, updated regularly and there was always communication.  I can not recommend this game, but i can recommend these devs.			"

												Meh. It's a $9.99 game at the most. I'm glad I have enough disposable income to purchase these games without feeling too butt hurt if I don't like them. I do, however, feel sorry for the people out there that can only make a single purchase once every few months and they choose this title.It's not a bad game. It's just a repetetive game. It's by no means a game of skill. Chance and luck ( at least from what I've played so far) are the name of this game. I'll continue to play a little while longer. Perhaps unlocking to get to endless mode but I do not have a lot of faith in things getting too exciting.I understand I don't have that many hours into it but I've played enough games in my life to know the gist of how it's playing out. To be honest this feels more like a glorified text adventure than anything else.I'll stick to my original comment about it being a $9.99 game. And to be honest, I would say give it about 6 months and you'll be picking it up for $5.99.			"

												The thing that you have to understand about Hand of Fate is that it is NOT a ""deckbuilding"" or ""card game"", even less than Ticket To Ride is a train simulator. In both cases there is some thematic resemblance to some other genre, but really the core mechanics are thoroughly different and in order to enjoy yourself, you need to understand what the game really is.In order to qualify as a ""card game"", the primary device of the game should be cards. In a typical card game, you might have a hand of cards to select from, or you might play cards to achieve certain effects. On a mechanical level, Hand of Fate is instead more like a roguelike beat-em-up. A game consists of a series of randomly-selected encounters, most of which culminate either in a 3d third-person combat scene, or in a ""select the good outcome"" shell game. Your goal is to plow through the encounters, managing your resources of health and food, to get to the end, where you fight a boss. Hand of Fate uses ""cards"" as its theme and narrative -- encounters and equipment are represented by cards, and you can customize the ""decks"" before play -- but otherwise it bears no similarity to card games whatsoever.But despite that, it's still an enjoyable game. Some encounters unlock other encounters, and there's a certain charm to trying to focus on some resource like food in order to try to be in a good position to ""win"" some encounter. Of course, it can be extremely frustrating when you're all set up, only to get wiped out by an unlucky ""draw"". Like most roguelikes, it can be punishing and it has quite a bit of replay value.The biggest problem with the game is tedium, which sets in around the 400th combat. I'm not sure if it's something about my computer or what, but it takes a long time to ""load"" certain of the (admittedly quite beautiful) encounters, and many of the combats cease to be challenging after you've played them enough. Because so few of the encounters give you resources, you need to be pretty lucky to have a round where it's even possible to ""beat"" some of the final encounters. And of the encounters that do give you resources, many of them are combats, which (again) lose their charm after a while.All in all I'd probably give HoF a 6.5/10. It's entertaining (and somehow I'm addicted to it), but you can safely skip it.[N.B. This is before the recent update adding ""fates"", so maybe things have changed a little bit.] "

												TL;DR: Hand of Fate is two repetitive, hardly innovative, unfortunately vague, sometimes-working games stuck together in a way that's at least pretty. Don't buy it without doing your homework.FULL REVIEW:Hand of Fate boasts an aesthetically gripping melding of two unlike games into a single experience that varies from unplayable to underwhelming. On their own, each of the ‘games’ of Hand of Fate fall far from being worthwhile. Together, the card game and the three-dimensional fighting game intermingle in a way that works just enough to keep players invested in a fairly transparent skinner box. Players are subjected to a deck-building card game that rewards repetitive play with a larger card base and challenges players through proper resource management. Game-to-game rewards are meted out through a shell game that is either too easy or too hard, an aspect that belies the RNG nature of the card game. Overarching rewards are given after successfully completing ‘token’ cards, which have a variety of conditions to complete (some of which are obvious, some obscure, almost all of them lacking explanation). Common issues of RNG exist and are easy to overlook, but there are some more severe instances such as stumbling upon very difficult encounters too early on that force a player have to quit a run of the game or even completely reset their progression overall. Card balance is a huge issue, with several cards being outright stronger than others regardless of situation. Furthermore, the encounter deck that the player must create is a vague collection—there are no indicators of what the encounters do, and some encounters seem variable in their options and outcomes. This makes constructing an encounter deck a chore of either looking up each card online or simply not knowing what each encounter brings in terms of challenge and reward unless the player has drawn that encounter several times. Hand of Fate seems to beckon players to experiment to discover what works and what doesn’t, while punishing players every time that it does not work out both in their current game played and across multiple future games.The fighting game, unfortunately, has even more severe issues. Combat is without weight, several mechanics of the system go unexplained, difficulty of encounters has to be inferred, some arenas are far too unforgiving, and so on. There is a simple system of click-to-attack, click-to-counter incoming moves that’s been popularly attributed to the Arkham series of games. Here, it barely works, as most encounters find the player vastly outnumbered by enemies that constantly attack. It is often difficult to even land two attacks in a row on an enemy without being interrupted in some way, giving combat a hectic and choppy flow. Camera angles can be a detriment to properly positioning the character, especially as some arenas feature traps and enemies can attack the player from off-screen. There’s a rolling maneuver that the player is intended to use to avoid several of the heavier attacks in the game, but the roll often comes out too late and does not offer much in terms of defense thanks to aforementioned issues along with painfully awkward hitboxes. Enemies take far too many hits, with the exception of when the player has specifically itemized to defeat an enemy type, and then combat becomes laughably easy against said enemies. There simply is no middle-ground, though. To further frustrate things, rewards are tied to number of monster cards drawn rather than individual monster difficulty--sometimes beating four skeletons can be just as fruitful as overcoming ten skeletons and a boss you fought before. Overall, combat is a mess, ranging from repetitive and easy to punishingly difficult thanks to a culmination of issues that are out of the player’s hands.Throughout the whole of the game, there simply is a lack of clarity—how much damage am I actually doing? How much damage does my gear reduce? What does an ice-cone attack even do? Is holy damage only extra-effective against undead? Who are these various characters? What does this encounter card even do? What is the purpose? Too many aspects are left to be inferred, both in terms of narrative and mechanics (an appendix would help, even). Oft-times, I find myself recursively fighting through boring encounters, hoping that I actually win the shell games this time around, so that I can unlock more shell games and progress to just being done. There isn’t a gripping narrative arc that makes me want to continue to play to the end. The gameplay from moment to moment is droll and forgettable. There’s nothing that stands out.This all goes without mentioning the several issues the game has just running. It outright crashes on startup, it crashes when loading some encounters, it sees framerate dips on some machines; so on and so forth. Thankfully, the support team for the game has been working on patching out and addressing these issues, mostly via their forums.This isn’t to say it’s all bad. I’d be kidding myself if I said the style of the game and the goals it sets out for aren’t awesome. There’s a very strong aesthetic that permeates the game just as there’s something refreshing about having these two genres put together in such a way that one doesn’t get too boring before the other takes over. Sure, dialogue gets repetitive and lore is a bit sparse at times and obfuscated at times, but it’s charming and interesting when it isn’t.All in all, Hand of Fate is promising, but lacks polish. There are plenty of options that can be fixed, plenty that can be clarified, and several aspects that can be advanced. Sadly, it seems that a complete overhaul would need to be done to each of the games that exist within Hand of Fate for them to work on their own. If you’d like to pick up two flawed, repetitive games that can distract from their flaws and repetition by means of alternation, go for it. If you’re a sucker for how a game looks rather than how it plays, buy the game like I did. If you want a worthwhile playing experience that’s rewarding outside of just earning more stuff in the game, though? Look to spend your money elsewhere.			"

												Find armor and weapon upgrades, then have them all taken away.  Travel past lots of shops and have 0 gold available.  I certianly enjoyed the first hour or two of play time, but as the levels became longer, and enemies tougher, all the gear I had collected just became more scarce and it would fall on me to complete entire levels with my starting gear, whlie being endlessly penalized along the way.  After the fourth or fifth level this became nothing but an edurance challenge of apathy, as I knew any good items I found along the way would only be striped from me, yet again, when restarting.I certainly don't want to mindlessly disparage the developer(s).  The game art is beautiful, the concept wonderfully original, but after a while I realized finishing levels became more of a coin-toss than much with skill.  And the odds were heavily stacked against me.  I called it and uninstalled.Since I must weigh in one way or the other on whether or not to recommend this game I'll have to say I do not.  Certainly not for $25 USD.  As of right now, I feel anything over $4.99 would be over-priced.  That's certainly not a reflection of how much effort and work has gone into the game; no, that would be much more, it is very well polished.  But five dollars is about as much fun as I can honestly admit to having.			"

												The advertised feature of this is the combat.It is relentlessly shallow.You press a WASD in the direction of an enemy, and then left-click until a green icon appears, and then you press Q. If a red icon appears, you press space.That's it. That is all that there is to combat. WASD to an enemy. Left-click if no-icon. Q if green icon. Space if red icon. You do not need any weapons or powers to defeat every level without getting hit once. This is almost a good game. But the combat sequences are the worst part of it. They're also the hyped feature, which leaves this being a trashy gimmick. Oh and, by the way? If the crummy combat wasn't bad enough? You also gotta wait for it to load into each one. The worst part of the game takes the best part of your time.There's a bit of fun with exploration, cash and food. But you will never, ever, ever, run out of food. And the cash bonuses are who-cares weak, because they only affect combat. Which, again, is so easy that you've got to be mentally-deficient to actually take any damage during.There are occasional trap-gauntlets. Those are sorta fun, just because the controls are so wonky that it's basically random whether you'll get hit or not. I almost came close to getting halfway towards fifty-percent of my health, in a trap room that lagged like butt, one time.Just pass on it.			"

												Nice idea, but the game is way too random to be enjoyable. Sure, you can ""build"" your deck, but the cards from it then go into random layouts, there's no way to effect the random event results which are flat 25%, 50% or 75% hit/misses, and the only non-random part (combat) is a bit slow and clunky. Plus all the constantly repeating menus/dialog/video makes every action take a second or so longer than it should do, so I found myself constantly hammering A to try and skip through. If it drops below £5, then might be worth it, but really weak for the current price.			"

												I do like the concept of the game and I want to make clear that this is not a bad game, it is however not a very good game either and I can't recommend it in its current state.This game is a mixture of 3D Brawling and a pen & paper card game.The p&p part is the ""strategic"" part of the game. You navigate through a grid of cards which are spread out on a table, face down.Each card represents a ""step"" and is revealed once selected, these cards tell a story and can have positive and negative effects. You can find equipment, be blessed, cursed, walk into traps or get assistance on your journey.Once in a while you encounter opponents you need to fight which brings us to the combat.You enter a tiny 3D combat arena, facing enemies specified by the card revealed.The controls are limited to attack, stun and dodge, if you have a shield equipped you can additionally block ranged attacks and counter melee attacks. Combat usually takes about 30 seconds to a couple of minutes.All this sounds great on paper but there is major caveat which runed my entire experience. The game is trivially easy or impossibly hard and unfair.The campaigns can be completed by simply hitting ""enter"" all the time moving to the next card. Your strategic choices hardly matter because combat is practically an extended QTE sequence. Block when you are told to block, counter when you are told to counter and tumble when you are told to tumble. Since the combat is trivial, any choices you make improving your combat skills by buying weapons, armor and shields, seem irrelevant and of little consequence. After a while I simply stopped buying stuff, skipping any treasures or risky opportunites for improvement, since they are simply not required.After a while the difficulty does indeed increase, however, not because more skill is required but simply because the combat is clunky and insufficient. You will encounter situation in which you will take damage no matter your equipment, because you are forced to react quicker than the games combat system allows you to do.So again, your equipment and skill do not influence the combat but chance and luck are the dominant factors.After the third or fourth campaign you are allowed to enter ""Endless Mode"" which does up the ante a bid since the cards no longer have to match your level of development. While challenge went up a bit, the meat of the game did not change, it is still playable by simply hitting ""enter"" all the time and having a small QTE sequence every now and then. The game has potential, I do like the idea, but for now it is not worth 20 bucks.			"

												There's so much to love about this game and I absolutely wish Defiant success with it, but I can't recommend it at the present. I love the graphics, voicing and concepts but the input method makes it awful and unpleasant for me. It's as if it started off life as a console game, was converted to PC and no-one bothered to consider how interacting with the game could be made a high quality experience for PC users.Keyboard input during combat is a recipe for repetitive strain injury and horrible control. If HoF had a remappable click to move system for combat (Diablo, PoE etc) that lent itself to putting the mouse click on say a Nostromo thumb wheel and counters etc to the keypad, I would recommend it - as it is, regrettably I don't recommend it to those who don't use a controller.

Towards the end you will be lucky if 1 out of 10 games are even remotely enjoyable.The way the shell game works with picking success and failure cards is godawful for me. I don't have the best vision, so I can't follow the success cards that well, and almost always mess up. However, this shouldn't even be a thing. It's called Hand of Fate. It's supposed to be RANDOM. The fact that you can follow the cards with your eyes and track the success cards is STUUUUUUUUUPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID.So unless I close my eyes for every single encounter, game is trash. It can ♥♥♥♥ off.			"

												I admit I haven't dug too far into this game (1.5 hours as of this writing, but that's with no losses), but the first impression it gives is of a game that's trying to fool you into thinking it has more depth than it does. By the point I'm at strategy (aka building your deck) is very simplistic and gives little indication that it's going to get more deep. Gameplay alternates between drawing cards (effectively rolling dice with no gameplay or strategy) and EXTREMELY bland combat.So basically no aspect of this experience stands out except the presentation.

												Yeah. Finally got it to open/download. Still crap. Controls are crap. Don't do what the game tells you that they do. You hit the button that the game tells you to when it tells you to and either nothing happens, or the wrong thing. MOvement? Yeah that doesn't work either. You basically move and random until you die or maybe make something esle die at random. Must have gotten your friends to plug this because it is horrid. You should be ashamed of yourselves.			"

												The game doesn't hold up well on my laptop, but I think that's because it's a five year old computer. What I could play of the game was fun. I liked the card elements of the game, but not the battle system. The small battle arenas were very frustrating because they don't give you much space to move when you're surrounded by enemies. This lead to me dying frequently which was annoying. I'm not sure if I would find this less frustrating on a faster computer because the graphics were really slow for me which made reacting in battle hard. At the moment, this is a mixed review because I liked elements of the game. I wish I could give it a full recommendation.			"

												I realize this is an early version and am open to changing my views as the game develops. Currently the game does not live up to it's two key claims. The game is the least rougelike of any rougelike game I've played. While the elements are there, just barely. Second the card game promise is more like a variation on randomly generated arenas and encounters with a different dressing. No real card game involved. Last the combat is very clunky, it feels like combat from a game 10+ years older trying to do Batman style combat and it just doesn't work. I really wanted there to be something I liked about this game, so far I haven't found it.			"

												Well, I love the game.. it's so unique.. but I will have to say one thing.. once you get past the first row of games, it becomes virtually impossible to win one.  That can be very discouraging.  it's like there is a very hard line between one row to the next with very little chance to get the new cards you need to make yourself stronger before these big fights happen.  Don't get me wrong, it's amazingly unique and I love a challenge and I recommend it if you don't mind constnatly losing early on.  The first row of story line was a decent challenge but after almost 20 attempts I can't get past the first one in the second row.  iF you go back to do an earlier one it's still harder because you passed the first row challenge... and less cards to work through in the game because it's early.  I can't decide if I recommend it as a whole or not just because of that one aspect.  So I'm going ot give it a thumbs down just to call attention to this in hopes that there is something that can be done to fix the almost impossiblity of moving ahead. Maybe it's the cards I ended up randomly winning that weren't so hot or something.  I'm sure some have gotten past that of course but I'm a long time gamer and these controls and concepts are not beyond my abilities.. ther is no way I am that bad at gaming that 20 attempts won't get me past that 4th game			"

												Made it all the way to the last *stage* so to speak, and I'm never playing this game again.Why? Completely unbalanced random BS utterly destroys any momentum you can build on your own. Too much the game is bogged down with random curse cards that leave the outcome entirely up to chance. Too often I have a good run going, then randomly I get attacked with three curses that destroy my health or give me a stupid handicap like making it so everytime I block I use up food (WHAT!?).And the combat, ugh the combat. First of all, it's basic Batman combat, but it's done rather poorly. Many times (EVERY BATTLE IN THE END GAME) I'll be evading one attack only to have another enemy attack me mid-evade, which I cannot avoid. Screwing me over. And the arenas are so small that in many cases divide and conquer is impossible. Oh, I'm pretty sure this game would be impossible to play if you're red/green colorblind. So keep that in mind. A great idea destroyed by lazy design. Avoid.			"

												I'd love to recommend Hand of Fate but.. no. The idea seems to be great but it gets very repetetive and provides low-to-now challange as you can beat everything without leaving your comfort zone. There is neither need or incetive to do otherwise. And that translatesino boring and unexciting game.			"

												TLDR: This is more of a unique random arcade game than an RPG. I recommend this game for playing but not for purchase. I like this game but I can't recommend buying it because price. I wouldn't have it at all if it hadn't been in the humble bundle. If it was always at that price, then yes, but otherwise your money and time is worth more.Full review:Since people reading these things love to blame the players for anything unflattering they read about a game, let me get my conditions out of the way. I've been playing on normal with the default fate or whatever and I'm almost exactly half way through the story mode. (one card over half) If that makes me unworthy to have an opinion in your opinion then stop reading.This game feels like a good indie game. This game is rather fun but it is in no sense an RPG. There is no real character building, even cosmetically. Everyone gets to be the same biker looking pirate dude and everyone gets the same starter garbage.This game qualitatively defies genre placement. Roguelike would definitely be the closest fit in the sense that you have a near totally random set of contexts and events. But the deck building aspect, the essentially unchanging arcade beat'm up combat, with quicktime event counters (that I never ever get to execute because crowds), on top of a turn based almost board game layer, just moves you so far away from the typical roguelike and any other concrete genre definition, that you start to question all the labels.Each encounter card is more or less trying to be a minigame, and the major story objective cards require a build up of power in order to have a prayer of victory, but since each card is trying to be a minigame you have some chance to fail at all of them incurring weakness, damage, loss, or simple failure to gain. That's fine in a vacuum, but the upshot of this at the larger scale is that you very easily fall into a rut where you are playing slots, just dying over and over hammering at token cards hoping they unlock stuff that will slightly improve your RNG odds at the deck building stage. But still, even then, because each card is trying to be a mini game, and victory requires a string of RNG victories (unless you're just a total twitch kill/counter/stun battle ninja) progression basically becomes exponentially unlikely.And that's the important distinction here, the difference between difficult and unlikely. Gamers generally I find don't understand the difference between challenging and difficult and unlikely. They also conflate various aspects of time investment, practice, luck, game play, micro management, actions per minute, command inflation, grind etc etc.Difficulty is about making choices and experiencing varying levels of game response to them. Probability on the other hand is about pulling the handle till you get 3 in a row. But getting back to this game specifically, yes in theory I could train to become a battle ninja, and I could train to be a spreadsheet flow chart probability ninja when it comes to deck building, I could train to be a shell game card shuffle expert, but even if I did all of them the RNG gods are probably going to screw me a consistent percentage of the time.What I'd like to see:The main thing this game definitely needs is a character creation step, even if it's just a choice of prefabs and a name box. Something to emotionally invest me in and link me to the character. I picture something like so many points to spend and you can spend them on anything from cards to stats. Some cosmetic choices would be awesome as well. Nothing wildly complicated. Think Torchlight 2. Maybe some low intensity long term progression, like the badass points system in BL2. I'd also like it if endless mode had everything in the game unlocked by default.Comment policy:I will delete any crap that annoys me for any reason. Life is too short as yet to endure being tormented by morons.P.S. If you don't say stuff the dev likes, you get banned from the community.			"

												I might change my mind later, right now I feel the difficulty curve on this game is out of whack.It feels like a bait and switch. I watched several reviews and lets plays and it looked like a fun somewhat casual game. And it is.... until you get the cup. Then it becomes a fairly hard core rogue like where every fight can end your game, where RNG can and will end your runs.I have noticed a pattern in the reviews most people recommending the game have very little time in game, while most people not recommending it have 10+ hours. That is because the game changes pace very suddenly.Now if you are looking for a hardcore roguelike that will challenge you. I think you will like this. If like me you thought you were getting a casual game... yeah you wont be so happy.			"

												Don't be deceived by the ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews. It's a really cool idea for a game, and they do a lot right, but they also do a lot wrong. The fighting works well, and there aren't any bugs, but it's extremely repetitive. You stumble upon a group of 3-4 bandits/pirates/angry townsfolk in the woods/ocean/town. The fights will be very easy, take a minute or two, and then you move on. Generally speaking, the game is really repetitive and will get boring quickly. I hear that it gets harder as you progress, and I've progressed for enough to see that, but the game doesn't change. The enemies just become harder and more frequent. Not worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								Hand of Fate is a good concept and has good potential. A player gains cards to add to a deck that is used to randomly generate a ""dungeon"" that must be expored/fought through to reach the end card which is a boss creature. The graphics are very good and the card system is creative. However, the game gets quickly repetative especially on creature encounters. All fighting encounters are basically the same and once you learn what choices benefit your character on cards tht allow a choice you can avoid negative effects easily and make easy gains. The game is a little slow in playing as you jump back and forth between encounter and card dealer. While the concept is solid the game play needs revising. While Initially the game interested me and the reviews I read lead me to beleive I would enjoy the game overall I was disappointed. The current price of the game is to high for what you get, perhaps once the game is finished it would be better.			"

												Caution: This game is not out of beta! Don't let the 1.0 fool you. If you buy this game you are buying an early access title, and a broken one at that. This one has been on my wish list for a while, but I have been burned on early access before, so I waited for the full release (ha!).  My first hint that something was a little ♥♥♥♥y was on the opening screen when it told me to hit the X box ""A"" to start the game. I get that this is a port over from the console world, but it strikes me a lazy and shoddy to not change those X box icons out for the players on PC. Whatever…not a deal breaker…I hit ""A"" (enter) and I'm put into cinematic of a hooded and masked gent levitating cards. Very spooky, great ambiance. However, the scene is ruined by the fact that his mask is glitched, and doing backflips as it clips through his head!( http://i.imgur.com/gyxRdyK.jpg) I'll let some glitches and clipping go on the final release on a huge game like GTA, Day Z, or Skyrim; but this game has one guy and he is bugged in the first 5 seconds of the game.Again, this is annoying, and not something I expect out of a game that claims to be out of beta, but it does not ruin the game. So let's talk gamplay. . . but wait , I can't play the game!  I have been playing mouse and keyboard and I have yet to find any way to navigate on the main game board, inventory screen or merchant screen. I can only click on what is highlighted as the first default option.  game: ""choose one of these 4 cards""me: ""number one""game: ""you can fight 40 bandits, 5 bandits, or 2 bandits""me: ""40""game: ""you can jab yourself in the eye with a fork or have 500 gold""me: ""well pass the fork because I CAN'T CHOOSE ANYTHING ELSE!""This is maddening; table flipping, rage quitting, neighbors calling the police maddening. Underlying all this is a nagging feeling like I'm somehow ♥♥♥♥ing it up. I'm not a casual gamer, so I'm assuming I'm not making some sort of ""keyboard not plugged in"" type of obvious mistake, but after hours of trial and error I have concluded that the game is either broken or requires actual telekinetic powers as demonstrated by the dealer to be able to play. I'm going to assume that I'm intended to use the AWSD controls to navigate, but these do nothing. I have sat in the inventory screen and pressed every button on the keyboard and mouse, and nothing will navigate. No way to select any weapons or armor, no way to pick different cards when I have any multiple card choice. Nothing but accept, or exit the game.This game is still VERY broken and if you pay for it be advised that the ""1.0"" ""not in early access"" is a total lie.   "

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Hand of Fate 

			Views: 212		

			Hand of Fate is a Card Game mixed with A 3rd person Dungeon Crawler, Rouge like experience on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/266510/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your...		

	Hand of Fate is a unique combination of adventure/card/rogue-like withwell done audio, and decent enough graphics.  The character you play as is amale warrior, so if you're hoping for a female character or a different styleof character, this may not be the best game for you.  I give the game devsprops for creating a card based game that is expanded, and pushes the envelope for a new style of game, and they did it well, but did they do it well enough?	Each level is an individual dungeons where you follow a path of cards, at the end of which you fight that levels boss.  This game wouldmore appropriately be titled 'Hand of Chance', as the random elements thatmake up a rogue-like combine with the card game elements to make an experience that relies more on the luck of the draw rather than skill or strategy.  	You start over on every level, and by that I mean you lose any itemsor money that you have, making every dungeon its own mission.  This negates the impact of dying, as you start the level fresh. The only loss you have would be of time spent playing.  	As to the equipment cards you have for your deck;  it is unlikely youwill be able to play that perfect card you need or want during a typical dungeon; of the 28 cards I had in my collection, it would be generous to say that I  saw 10 during any one dungeon. Obviously you want to have more cards that are chosen based on what you enjoy, but overall the gear or weapons in your deck become less important, due to the small chance you will actually see them.	Every level is randomly selected, which may give it a new look and feelas you progress forward, but it takes away control or any sense of power as there is no choice in where you go.  The randomization of what gear you may get combined with the random level you may end up on, and the random number of traps on that level can determine how well you do on a level.  The combat was not challenging; a matter of mashing the  mouse button and dodging when the green light flashes.  Skill and tactics play no part in the battles, only having the correct timing.  This gets quite boring very fast after a few battles.	This game boils down to chance;  equipment, levels, perks, relics,weapons, traps, all is dependent upon the chance that you get the right one.  There is no tactical challenge in this game; what combat there is is simplisticand offers no challenge.  If you're looking for a casual game, and like cardgames and rogue-likes, this may be for you, but if you're looking for a gamebased on skill rather than chance, I cannot recommend it.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Cool idea, but not overly new, combat is super boring/ easy, doesn't feel very polished, lots of weird things like randomly slowing the game down when you swing at someone in the middle of a fight. Lots of animations that stop the game that happen over and over and over, without any way of skipping them. Its decent but definately does not warrent an overwhelmingly popular review on here, 6 or 7/10 from me.Also, should be said, on sale for 20$ makes me feel like I overpaid.			"

Early Access Review
								-A Pretentious Roguelike That Likes to Think Itself A Much Higher Station than it actually Is-I like roguelikes, hell, I love roguelikes. And the Pretense of thise game is pretty cool. Whereas most roguelikes have been a crutch for relatively rookie developers to lean on while they find their feet. This is no different for these guys, except that they managed to hire a voice actor to say things in their game so they've decided they're big time. Although a lot of roguelikes are very similar this one is really quite similar to Faster Than Light. They both have the same format of traveling from point to point and facing random encounters. But when it comes to combat once opts for a top down RTS approach whereas Hand of Fate goes for an Arkham Series hand to hand combat schtick and I'll give it that, the combat is ok. It's smooth enough, there are some bugs which should have been priotities to fix even for an early access game (They're doing UI tweak patches now so they must feel they're near the end).   The main failure of this game is in between. The narrative of Faster Than Light is simple but direct. You come across a situation and you decide what to do. You weigh up odds, what your crew is like and  the outcomes to your decisions are rational. Stupid decisions get you killed. Whereas in Hand of Fate, everything is reduced to a game of 4 card trick to see if the outcome is good or bad. By the time you have enough information to weigh up the pros and cons of what you are doing, it is too late and you have to pick a card. Cards are deceptive and irrational. You will not be rewarded for being cautious or brave, you will either be lucky or unlucky and in Roguelikes I like to feel that my judgement and my skill as a player is one of the major factors in defining my progress. If I wanted the experience that Hand of Fate provided I could just roll a D20 and punch myself in the nutsack every time I rolled a 5 or less then play 5 minutes of Arkham City every half hour. Early access isn'r responsible for these problems. These are inherent failures in the decisions made by the game developers and their determination to drive home a pretentious card gimmick at the loss of things that actually make the game fun. Especially when a single run can take upwards of half an hour with a slow iteration time and poor communication. There are plenty of Roguelikes out there that knock this game into a cocked had. If it's in a humble bundle or on sale for like $3 I guess you could buy it, but otherwise there are plenty of better games made by better developers who could use your money to make better games in the future.

Early Access Review
								While I love the concept of the game, it needs alot of work. Likes:Basically you have 2 decks; yours and the card master. After the card master adds more cards to the decks, cards are ""randomly"" laid on the table in a path or area setup. You move your token to each card or choice of card and it can be a good or bad, you continue this until you reach a card that takes you to the next level or the named. Dislikes:There isnt a character builder to set gender/age/skin color, etc.. Who wants to play an old, mostly bald, white male with no abilities in combat? There isn't a choice of tokens to represent the player as he/she transverses the card levels.The tutorial fails to correctly explain how the cards work.  Example what the red dots on the monster cards and card tokens mean, deck building mechanics, how food/gold really works, curses/blessings etc... While you can choose what cards you have the chance to get and what encounters you will face, the game always skews towards the extra cards the cardmaster added.The combat interface/controls/movement are rough at best and past the 3rd named the number/type of monsters is overly stacked against the player.  It's disappointing that no gold or equipment you gain in a level carries over to the next. So you start each level with limited food/gold, nearly defenseless with a rusty axe attempting to battle 10 or more creatures in a small area that has resetting traps using jerky controls on your first movement. You are saddled with a curse that drains your gold that you can never afford to get cured. You barely have enough to get food if you ever get a merchant card.The game as it stands now isnt worth purchasing. Hopefully there will be an update addressing some of the problems. "

												DO NOT be fooled by this game. Everyone and their dog is saying that the combat is horrible right? Well, guess what. That is 99 percent of the game. Majority of the cards you step in has a combat encounter. The boss is a QTE and a combat encounter. What the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Listen, Devs. If you can't make a good combat system, don't let that be the MAJORITY OF THE GAME.			"

								This game is not a bad game, it's early access so before I get that thrown in my face, I think it's fair to say that the overall game isn't gonna change fromwhat it is now, if you've been following since kick starter you can see not much has changed, sure they will add in monsters and that's great.. I'm reviewing this game in the current form, 23/08/14, I don't know the version number.The idea is great, I like the style of fighting getting a nice rythem for combos and the reversal/perry is always my fave in games like this.The graphics, I like alot.The narrative done great.Sound goodso what is the problem? Well for me it's all soooo slugish, and repeitive, you are basically doing the same thing over and over with slightly increaing difficulty, this makes me play the game, beat a boss, then think ""do it again to beat another boss? Nah""And for £15, I'm sorry but £5 at best.I like the game, but I'm reviewing on price and current state, and right now it's not worth the price.EDIT: 05/09/2014A huge update has been added on and I've noticed a performance improvement, it's hard to tell as I have a beast of a pc, it might just be quicker animations or just better optimasation, so it's more enjoyable, a lot more concent as been injected into the game as well as new combo like system. For me this is very promising a lot of early alpha you see devs get your money then run, this one seems to be working hard and it's made me excited about the future of this game... I STILL feel it's far to repeitaive though.Price £10 and I'd recommend buying it, however at current price it's still a No, but only just!			"

Early Access Review
								So a friend refered this game to me to check out. Heres the scoop Its really fun at first there around 70 quest an about half of them change up depending if your successful on the skills test. When you get to the first kings bosses it gets stupid hard to the point you hit a skill wall unless your young and have super reflex your going to have to reset an start over. 19 hrs of game play and experance 80% of the game. 2nd when i frist downloaded the game an installed it. The open screen says press A to enter.. (A) for a gamepad I only have mouse an keyboard. After searching the fourms found where someone posted. to hold shift key when loading the game it gets you into the setting menu from there found that the A button had a second setting map to the return key. Theres no way to set the difficulty on the game. So if your a older gamer like me you may come to the point where your unable to beat the game.  It needs alot more content, a setting for easy,medium,hard,extream, And a lot more loot all in all  theres around 220 cards an items in the game. My suggestion wait for this to go on sale for $5 or less or untill till they have a finished product. Another thing at the boss kings unless you get really lucky on your random map and loot at the start of the level expect to be re-playing the same quest over and over untill you get a good loot drop at the start of the level.

If you'd like to experience this game in a nutshell, just get a deck of cards and start drawing. When you get two cards in a row over 5, have some jackass taunt you for sucking at the game and then start over. The end.			"

												This game is like going to one of those Japanese Hibachi restaurants when you're starving. All you want to do is eat, but you've got to sit through the whole production before you can get any food. You go in to sit at a table and the chef has to make small talk while you watch him try to flip morsels of meat into your tablemates mouths, you have to endure the stuipid onion volcano trick (wow great job) and finally, twenty minutes later, he scrapes some rare steak onto a pile of rice and since you're starving you go hog wild and eat everything you've been given in large mouthfuls. Finsihed with your meal and still hungry, you're handed a bill that seems entirely disproportionate to the amount of food you actually got.A deck building roguelike you say? Make my own deck and then fight through it? Wow this sounds awesome, here's $25!And then you download it and you have to wait every turn while the stupid dealer cinematic plays and he sluggishly deals the cards out onto the table, making the same remarks every time he deals a particular card. There's combat in this game, if you can call it that, since it's about as fun as a QTE and just as challenging. This game would be awesome if they had more card variety and they removed the third person combat and (especially) the whole sitting-at-a-table-playing-cards-with-a-wizard gimmick.This is a very bad game. Do not buy this.			"

								Hand of Fate is something new. It has some gameplay that I havent seen before. But the elements it uses are very familiar.The game revolves around a deck of cards which are shuffled and then laid out to form a path that you need to follow to the end. Every card will give you a challenge which depends on luck or combat. There are also some exceptions to this rule if you run into a shop or if you end up in a maze of traps to get to a treasure. Besides going from card to card you will have to keep an eye on your health, money and food. Every step you take costs 1 food. If you land on combat it can cost you food and if you land on a shop you can spend your money.The main reason for not recommending the game is the combat. Although it's definetly not the worst implementation of a fighting system in a game, it doesnt feel fluent enough to feel good. As this game is still in Early Access it might improve, but for now I wouldnt recommend it based on this element. This has also to do with the price point of the game. For a game like this around 10EUR seems to more fitting.5/10			"

								When this game came into my inbox, with promises of being the next brilliant game, then i am always dubious. And i am dubious, because majority of the time, it is false promises.This game graphically, is up there, even when your on the fighting scenes, they are reasonably decent. But apart from that, it is very poor gameplay, poor all round, to be honest.Devs do not listen, they always think they know it all. You criticise constructively, giving your opinions, which you get from playing the game. And they shoot you down, saying ""You know nothing about making games"". They are right about that, but i know a thing or two about gaming, many genres and different types of games. And i know from my 25+ years of gaming, that this game is poor.If the Devs want to stay in developing games, they need to take constructive opinions and work with them, not criticise the player, which myself, they came to me asking for my opinions, not the other way round.If i paid for this game, i would of felt cheated.

												I bought this game through Indie box so my hours on here aren't fully representativeThis game was everything I hoped it would be.The music is more ambient than instrumental, but I think that compliments the game well since most of the action in this game comes from the cards the dealer gives you. In that vein I've never felt like I was given an unfair situation when a card was flipped. There's also a simple progression system where as you complete levels, win challenges that are bet on by the dealer and other events you gain more cards to build your deck using. You don't know what the new cards do until the first time you draw them in regular game play.In this game combat is handed through you using equipment cards you draw or buy from the various merchants you may encounter on some cards using gold you collect. The enimes you encounter depend on what challenges you end up facing and what enemy cards are drawn. You replenish health either by healing or each time you travel while you have food. The only complaint I have about the battle system is sometimes you end up soft-stunned if you get attached by a bunch of enemies at the same time.Very solid game! "

								This game has a very unique aesthetic that I personally really enjoy, table top games are personal love of mine. Game play focuses on you overcoming an enemy deck with your own crafted decks choosing what encounters you will find on your path and what rewards you will receive.  With an active combat system based on the batman series it keeps things fresh from the non-active story telling moments. A healthy amount of RNG to keep things fresh. Works sort of like a single player DND in some ways. Thing I love most is when entering combat how the cards actually physically appear and create your gear gives a very good vibe of connection between both parts of the game. The price point a strong plus, cannot wait to see the finished product.			"

								Magic, mystery, twists of fate, and lots of deaths awaits you. All guided by a man you need to trust but really shouldn't, as he is out to kill you for the last and final time.  The 'Dealer' awaits you to enter his domain, waiting to shuffle his deck of Fate, and draw an enchanting journey from its heart.What is it:It is kind of hard to explain. It is cross between Munchkin and Fable without bright humor, it is Fable without the Open World. Your equipment is collected like Munchkin, with the cards you collect through the encounters you meet. Every time you die a 'Game of Fate' you start over again, all cards reshuffled and your hero back to square one. However, not all is lost: Progression is made whenever you beat a 'Game'-boss. This and succeeding in other encounters will earn you 'tokens' which unlock more encounters and/or weapons. These new cards can be added to your deck to change your adventure. Some encounters are part of a chain, some sort of side-quest, with all its own mysteries and loot.Basically it is the bare minimum of a  collectible card game, with deck-building elements, mixed with some RPG-elements where you have to fight for your life, spiced up with a choose your own adventure type of decision making.Why I like it:It resonates deeply with what interests me. It reminds me of the Story Time from the Longest Journey. I know what it is, but what is IT really. It reminds me of Fable (minus the bright humor, it is all dark here), but I could laugh at certain points at what happened to me. But most of all, it is mysterious. The 'Dealer' taunts you with snippets of knowledge of what you are, where you are, and why you are all doing this. What I don't like (Keep in mind this is Early Access, things might have changed since the moment of writing/updating):The current combat system, and camera need some work. It has been in state of flux for a while now. But the big issues still is that the camera is so damn unhelpful at times. Monster can block up a lot of your screen if you aren't careful with your own positioning. I lost from full health just because I couldn't see what I was doing behind a Fire Golem who decided to use a massive damage AoE every second or so.Other thing is that game is best played with a controller, and you damn well know it is designed around it. Navigating the menus with the mouse is tedious and in combat you only use the buttons on the mouse for block or stun. The 'Cancel'-button is the 'Tab'-Key, while the 'Confirmation'-Button is the 'Enter'-key. My advise, rebind the 'attack'-key and the 'stun'-key to two keys close to the enter and you are golden. Drag the mouse in a corner and play the game with Keyboard only. It is completely do-able.My final gripe are animations. For example the 'Dealer', especially later in the game, will freeze up when dealing a large stack of cards. As the time needed to 'deal' the cards is longer as his animation-length. Besides that, you are forced to watch him deal every time your start a 'Game of Fate' with him. The animations in combat are okay. Sounds might be missing, call me spoiled but the lack of sound during some encounters are a bit... lacking. But that is Early Access, not all is there.Should you buy it?Depends. Keep in mind that this is an Early Access, things might change. However, in its current state and what I have read about what it will become: I recommend this game to anyone who likes the idea. My advice though is to watch a few videos, or read a bit further before buying into an Early Access.nted			"

												An excellent card game, combined with a fluid combat system and devious traps. It reminds me of the Pathfinder card game, with more interesting mechanics and a huge variety of encounters and cards. No two games are the same.			"

												This game is awesome. I'd love some new content and a better balance mechanic for endless than randomly losing 50% of your supplies and random items... but I suppose that could be difficult to accomplish considering the nature of the game.			"

												This game is about the ideo game equivlent of dungeons and dragons. First of, the graphics are amazing. It is a card based role playing game with much content to be done, and if you finish the story theres still endless. The only downsides are that there are still a few glitches and the last level is almost imposible even on easy (coming from a guy who defeated every other level). So if you like the kind of game this is then i would definately recommend you to buy it!			"

												The game is a 3D brawler, which uses cards to present opponents, loot, gear and the random encounters you'll meet.  It's a very good first game by an indie developer and I'd love to see more stuff by this team.  It's obvious that this game was made with tender loving care.  Pros:The game has a wonderful aesthetic and the music and atmosphere are fantastic.   The presentation is absoultely the best thing about the game.  The voice naration and card dealing are first rate.  The game has absoultely wonderful graphics too.Cons:The brawling animations are functional, but need work.  It feels like the game isn't as responsive as it should be, and at times the small amount of input lag can cause damage or death to your character.  It's difficult to pull off 3D brawling with a counter system and I personally feel like the game would've been better if it was a 2D brawler.  The camera can also be a source of frustration at times.  When your character moves farther away, the camera doesn't show the near end of the level and it's possible to not see incoming attacks.The game starts off very easy but difficulty ramps up a bit too fast for my taste.  The first few levels are very easy and by middle of the game I was struggling to reveal all the encounters and live.   By the time I hit the last couple of levels I felt like all I wanted was to just get through with as few encounters as possible, which imho is not how the game should be played,  I actually had to lower the difficulty from hard to normal for the last 3 levels because I could not finish it on hard.

PositiveSo far from what I've played I can tell this is a rather original and fun game. Mechanics mixed together like this really seem to work, and once the game itself is optimized I'm sure this will be a very popular roguelike.NegativeAs it stands so far, it lags too heavily and with the fact you can't tweak the individual graphics settings in any way there's no real remedy to it at all. And the resolution options lack quite a bit. I'd love to play this game in full screen but I don't have a monitor wide enough according to the options available.			"

								Quite a nice game.In its current state, there are bugs and imbalances, but the developers seem very responsive on the forums, so I have no doubt the game will eventually get balanced just right.Basically, each game you start, you start with the default equipment for that boss challenge (level), and progress from there.If you like rougelikes, and like the idea of building your own stack of possible encounter cards and a stack of possible equipment for each battle, as well as fighting each encounter in a Batman style... then I would suggest you get this game.I'd even say you should get it while it's it Early Access to support the development and tweaking to give the devs as much time as possible to make the game as good as they can make it.Edit: Oh, and I forgot to mention that you should run the game on ""fastest"", because at least on my computer on ""good"", my input was sometimes ignored. Running on fastest mode is a lot more responsive and still looks fine to me... at least until the game has been patched to handle a bit of lag, or of course if you have a stronger computer.You could also look at the review by ExtraCredits

												I would recommend this game with an asterisk. This is an amazingly original and fun game, and its well executed; up until the point where 3/4 of the way in it becomes unplayable.I got a very enjoyable 8 hours out of it, and am satisfied totally with the 20 bucks i dropped on it. And I'll probably never play it again. There are a few encounters that are broken, but they can happilly be removed from your deck. What can't be fixed however is the insane difficulty that the random combat starts to ramp into one the third artifact is recovered. Once you get to the 10th and 11th bosses, you're lucky to complete a floor or two without fighting two previous bosses at the same time (which is impossible). This is a fun game that sadly gets very irritating in the end game; but is worth your time and money to support something so wonderfully original.			"

												There isn't much about HoF that hasn't already been said by other, some famous, currators. This game is pretty good, and one of the few that I haven't regretted spending the money on (19.99). I haven't even dabbled in this genre much, but the theme and randomness of the decks is a very interesting take on procedural generation. My only complaint is the wonky-ish combat system. The writing is good, the game play elements are novel and interesting; it's an all around good game and well worth the price of admission. I'm looking forward to expansions & cards, crossing fingers for future Steam Workshop hooks.			"

												As a veteran card game nerd I feel inclined to say I love everything about this game. From the dungeon crawling (why am I always running out of food!) to the deck building (don't make me choose!)  to the atmosphere. its all great.      Long story short you play through a dungeon built from the cards in your deck mixed with a few from the dungeon master. They are organized at random and make the field of play. This creates a random game board so you will never have the same run through twice. There is some equipment, gold, and food management elements that will force you to choose between completing quests or risking starvation and the like. You unlock more cards as you play, adding new layers of difficulty and possibile encounters to add to your deck as you progress. The campaign is long and challenging but not at all boring and tedious. I enjoyed it a lot. If you get through the campaign there is an endless play mode so your adventures can continue long after the story is done.      If I had to say something bad for the appearance of fairness I guess the combat is a bit simplistic. That said it in no way detracts from the amazing gameplay. Thats it, thats the one and only thing I can even sort of criticize. Now seriously go buy this game, you can thank me later.			"

												I have written only a couple of revies in my time on steam. I've just finished playing this for the first time and i felt i must immediatly add my two cents:What an amazing game. Yes people are complaining about the combat but i find it acceptable. Having never played Batman (which is what it is being compared to) I cant complain. It works.. they either patched it since the complaints or people are just overly picky about it. The only thing that bothered me though was the camera, it just doesnt feel right sometimes.Combat problem aside. The rest of the game is amazing. The Dealer is voiced so well he makes the game for me. Along with the cards themselves, the stories they tell hooking me in. I still havn't completed the story yet, I've had some really bad luck on some of the runs. There is enough game here to keep me coming back. Infact ive spent 9 hours on the game and that was all in one sitting. I still have a lot of cards to unlock and even when that is done, there is endless mode.There are enough variations in enemies to keep the combat and draw interesting.In one run i was doing really well and was on the last floor, after a very hard struggle of ups and downs id finally made it to within one square of the boss tile. All i had to do was defend myself from an ambush by a falling log ""Easy enough"" i thought.. but then the draw. First enemy ""Queen of plague"" .... ""well atleast it cant get any wo.."" second card ""Jack of plague"" ......... Needless to say that run ended there. But i laughed at my misfortune and moved on with the next run.Pros:Narration is A+ (I just wish there was more but even the repetative narration isnt a bad thing.)Cards tell wonderful little stories.Variation of curses on each boss dungeon to keep it challenging.Game of chance/skill with picking the right outcomes.Random runsSimple combat. (I personally think a complicated combat system would take away from the rest of the game.)Cons:Frustrating at times when the luck goes against you.camera angle in combat (very minor issue personally)			"

												A really good mix of deck building card based gameplay with rpg / roguelike elements. Combat is fairly simplistic but that doesn't detract from the game itself too much. The evolution of both your own character and the enemies is interesting, the VO is excellent and the music and sound effects are good too.Things I didn't like - towards the end of the game, I don't like how the card shuffle speed increased, it was a bit unecessary and removed the skill from watching the cards and replaced it with blind luck.Also the difficulty spike (especially on the last 3 bosses) is ridiculous. Made the game go from fun and sometimes challenging to just frustrating.Over all it's a good game. I don't know if i'll end up putting in the time required to defeat the last 3 bosses, as at this point it's a mix of luck and frustration.			"

												Excellent game! You traverse a dungeon whose rooms are face down cards. Each card has an event or encounter that can lead to combat, treasure, fortunes, or misfortunes. You unlock more cards as you complete events, most of them being a chain (ex. Complete the Ritual event, unlock the Lich boss fight event, complete that and unlock the Druids event storyline). There is luck involved but a lot of it is also in your hands (Do you try to sneak past an enemy or face it in hopes of good loot? Do you really want to get involved in a blood auction?).There are tons of items that make combat interesting. I'll agree the animations can be a bit clunky at times when compared to something like the Batman games (it uses the basic combat mechanics as those), but it is not as bad as most reviewers will have you believe. Combat gets pretty difficult and intense in the later half of the game, and I pretty much just beat the final boss of the game because I had bought/found just the right items to keep me alive.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of roguelikes or just adventure games. The narrative is well written and the stories, even though they are just text through cards, are interesting and make you want to see them through. Trying to get some of the achievements can also be fun.The Wildcards DLC adds more variety to the roguelike elements by giving you Fates (classes essentially) that have a buff and a debuff on your character. It also adds Easy and Hard mode. I didn't use any Fates during my initial run, so I can't say much about the DLC, but I don't think it's worth the full price.			"

												Difficult to master, easy to learn, very intriguing. It's not really a card game, even though it pretends to be.Small sound bugs (narrator repeating something he said before the encounter started, at the beginning of an encounter), graphics being not as the'yre supposed to be (come on, if 65% of your game is a guy sitting at a table moving his arms across it, his robes shouldn't be clipping through the damn table!!) and sometimes irritating slow-motions when you desperately would like to dodge an attack......can't taint an overall great athmosphere and immense replayability at the reasonable price of around 20 Euros. And the campaign is damn hard. I keep dying more and more often as I progress, but I just pick it up and try again.That's how games are supposed to be, not like ""Oh, you lost two times? Let me teleport you to the end of the level and set the difficulty to stupidly easy!""9/10 (-1 for sound and graphics stuff described above) - would buy again.			"

												Imagine the Souls series (in terms of difficulty) with more narrative, less trudging around and more bosses (simpler boss mechanics, more trash mobs in boss fights). I dred drawing two 6 of (insert any mob) and a boss cardWhen I first started the game, I laughed at how easy the combat was. I thought ""I'm just going to cheese my way through this and be done in a few hours"". I was sorely mistaken! This game will punish you, punish you some more then punish you again for good measure.The best thing about this game is the randomomly generated playing fields. You can go from 100% n00b gear to 100% end game in 3 turns, if you're lucky! You could also make it to the final boss with all your n00b gear and have your max health reduced to 1/100. This game has a story mode and a ranked infinite play mode. Story is like the best tutorial ever made and infinite play mode will go forever until you concede or die. The best part of infinite is it is ranked, so you can have bragging rights and make your friends jealous!This isn't just for TCG fans! this game is fantastic and absolutely belongs in your library!

												This game is different than anything that I played before. It starts putting you in a Magic: The Gathering style of game, where you play against the mysterious Dealer with an awesome designed deck of Tarot cards. In the beggining it works like an normal RPG, but with the cards doing the work of the dices. And then, when randown encounters happen, you see yourself in action, literally, in hack'n'slash mini-games with a very Arkham City type of Gameplay that`s simple and satisfatory. In general, I was very please with this game, and I really hope to see more from it in the future.			"

												First off, the melee Scales (Lizardmen as they're called) are bs. Other than that, this game is amazing. The rouge-like atmosphere helps keep the game fresh, and with every new card you get from card tokens, it makes the story bigger. Card tokens can either give you weapons/armor/story or all of the above. This game has a lot of luck and faith. It can read your mind when you internaly beg to not land on a certain card, and it'll give you the double middlefinger and have it right there. With that in mind, if you do over come that obsticle, it feels really rewarding to beat that unwanted challenge and gain card tokens (until you land on the next unwanted card). This game can get hard at times. but you can always try something new. You can change what cards you want to use, be it story or equipment, giving you different ways to attempt to clear a story boss. All in all, this game is really addicting and really easy to get into. 9/10 would rip my own heart out of my chest again.			"

												Fun and with a unique style. People complain about the difficulty at higher tiers but there are definitely strategies to win and continue advancing. The expansion cards aren't balanced but do well to add another level of strategy. Easily conquerable within 10-15 hours, with an endless mode to keep you entertained afterward.			"

												I very much like the presentation of this game. The dealer has good voice acting, the way the encounters are presented, with the dealers cards, and you own cards being placed in the 3D arena. The only thing that is a bit off are the blocking animations in the arena. It plays like any of the batman or shadow of mordor games, but the animation quality of the player and enemies isn't as great as in those games. Nonetheless, I picked it up on sale, and it is very much worth your time and attention. This game oozes charm. :)			"

												I suggest you watch a lets play on this game.  Total Biscut has a good one.  Anway, I think this is a good game at heart, but after playing it a bit, is just isn't for me.  It looked like it might be something of interest from the lets play videos I watched, but the combat was rather dull and lack of character building and starting over for each ""match"" just didn't click for me.  I am not sure if I should give this game a thumbs down since I didn't care for it, but I think the author of the game did a good job and I do not want to put it in the same category as games that I really do think are bad games.

								so. this game has a cool premise, pretty much as advertised. the dealer lays out a dungeon, made from seperate encounters, each represented by a card. these encounters are either just text decisions like ""give peasant half or all of your food"" and you have to guess, being either rewarded or punished afterwards. this card-dungeon is rogue-lite-challenging, meaning you can just starve because of plain bad luck with your draw and event choices. the other encounters, Id say about sixty percent - are the action rpg part of the game. the combat system is the weakest link in the chain still, and every single type of ranged enemy still has the potential to make me ragequit - but itll have you on your toes at least...in my opinion, the dealer animations in between cards are too long and unskippable. a lot of events determine their outcome by having you draw from four cards, say success/success/failure/huge failure. itll then show you these four, flip them, shuffle them TWICE (!), spread them out, pause a split second more just to annoy you further - and THEN you can draw one of the four. which youll do every thirty seconds. similar stuff goes for other animations, say the laying out of the dungeon in the beginning.besides from these problems, and early-access-issues like say, lack of sounds, the game is cool. the mix is a cool idea, and you can build your dungeon event AND equipment decks in between dungeons, that determine what stuff you might face off against, get benefited by, or loot.

												This is old school D&D mixed with timing based button mashing. Character development is card based. Unlock cards build your deck and influence the story before you. The random is the feel of D4 rolls. It really does feel like a dungeon master game. This is the first game in a long time to hold my attention. I am an older gamer and my only complaint was getting the interface set up to my liking, it took about an hour. Now I am enjoying it and give it 4 of 5 because I don’t give anything 5 of 5. Graphics are awesome if you ever wanted to be a Spartan in 300. There is a slight glitch/big with the interface of my monitor, so I have to launch, quit and relaunch.			"

												This is a great game. When i first saw screenshots of it i wasn't immediately drawn to it. But picking this up in the summer sale I don't regret it and would easily say its worth its full price. I can only hope they will do a sequel. What really rounds this game off is the voice over (think Michael Caine-like) of the card dealer whom has a think or two to say about your choices and what has happened as you make choices and at times try your luck. And there is random luck involved where sometimes you can lose a prized weapon or artifact from that.  You have a series of boss fights if you will per game. So each game could last from twenty or so, perfect for those casual gamers who want to play in short bursts.  As you defeat more foes at the end of a game you unlock more cards and events.  It is a simple game to play but really pulls you in. And as i said i hope the developer has plans on a sequel.			"

												I usually don't play games from studios that i've never heard of buttook a chance with this game. I was a bit shocked with the basic start up menu and was expecting something bad because of how simple it was but i was even more shocked when i discovered how fun the game was. You start your first 4 quests as tutorial type missions where they introduce the elements of the game and do very well explaining how it works. The Narrator who is also the man you see in the game cover adds a great element to the game. I really enjoyed his comments to make the game interesting and they did a great job focusing on his animation.Too sum it up its a game of randomness on every quest you go to making them slightly unique. As the game progresses you unlock cards that can add to the randomness and even add more difficulty of the game. The game is indeed a bit to easy in the medium and easy setting. The hard setting can get difficult because the odds are stacked against you but to me it adds to the fun.The combat is done similar to the Batman games where you have attacks and counters. Some opponents attack faster and some can not be dodge which adds a bit more difficulty because usually you're out numbered. You get random weapons and armor through out the game based on the ""helpful"" cards you have in the deck that you can create making the game easier or harder. Their is also a recommended setting in case you don't want to tinker with it.  "

												Hand of Fate is a unique and refreshing blend of a few great genres. It pits you in a game of life or death (though really there's not much risk to you aside from a few broken knuckles) against ""The Dealer"", who is a mysterious and actually pretty solid character. Mechanics: Basically this game you play with the dealer is a kind of choose your own adventure/board game where the tiles on the board are random cards which either come from your deck or the dealer's deck. I'm paraphrasing Total Biscuit here, but your cards (usually) serve to help you gain some leverage in the form of gold or weapons, where as the dealer's cards are there to mess your♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Occasionally you'll land on a combat card which will transition the game from a top down boardgame into a 3rd person hack and slash fight which is comprable to a very simplified Darksouls.Overall, I love how dynamic the mechanics are and everything just feels right on.Pros:  Solid combatInteresting tarot esq themeGreat sense of RPG progression Plenty of cardsVery dynamicFresh incorporation of collectible cardsCons: Difficulty progression isn't on point Replayability is questionableSome of the quests seem too much like a choreNot many game modesClasses seem a bit unbalanced, as do items Overall it's a great game. I'd love to see multiplayer somehow implemented, maybe 1 player 1 dealer, 2-3 players AI dealer, I'm not sure, but this game has tonnes of potential to take it one step further and I hope the devs know that.8.5/10 Definitely worth.

												I never do reviews, but honestly, this game is too amazing not to do one.Hand of Fate is a card game, yes, but not exactly.  It's also an action rpg, and that's what's so unique about it.  Not only that, but the game is totally randomized, like an actual card game.  You choose a few cards from your deck, and the card-master stuffs a few surprises in your deck, and you play the game.  You have absolutely no idea what comes next, and it's not always in your favor.Not only that, but there are quests in the cards themselves.  For example; you have a card (Let's say Desert Storm) and you find that card in the game.  If you ""play your cards right"" then you'll be able to get the coin of the card and get the next encounter card, which is Lost in Desert, and so on so forth.I completely recommend this game.  It is worth every penny, and if it's on sale you buy it without a second thought.			"

												Where to start, I've read reviews good and bad before buying this.. But one thing is certain, it is in my opinion well worth buying, I love card based and hack and slash based games, well this is a combination of the two, while not too sure how it would actually be like other than what reviews have said, something about this game is actually enjoying. Things I'd want to share -  UnderstaNding the game isn't that hard, I looked at all of the card and had no idea after the ""tutorial"" but after I used recommended settings for a round I took another look and it was all plain as day, the cards are self explainatory, in the cases in which to use them are all up to the player.I wouldn't say there is too much strategy going along with this game at the begining, but as you progress into each round there is def- need to put some thought into actions before you go balls to the wall and speed through the round.It feels like each round gets harder and harder as you progress, the first round I ended pretty decently, round two was a bit rougher and round 3 I BARELY got through. So if you can just imagine what the rest were like, although there is an option to turn down the difficulty which beginners may need to if you're having some trouble understanding still.This review may not be as informative as others but it's just some things off the top of my head.Overall the concept of this game is great, while i still haven't completed it yet, I feel somewhat addicted to the game and I hope the devs fix the little things and keep on top of this game, I feel it has much potential.  Highly recommended.			"

												Its amazing how presentation can spice up a simple game.This is a rouge like where you guide your hero through various challenges, slaying enemies and defeating the boss at the end of each level.  the twist is everything is depicted as card wielded by a mysterious stranger playing across from you.  each encounter is a card thats flipped over and revealed when your peice lands on it and it can be anything from an enemy abush to helping a wandering priest.  most of chanllenges will be simple text scenarious where your given a choice of what to do. depending on your answer you'll sometimes auto succed or fail or four cards with fail or succed will be revealed (how difficult the challenge depends on how many of the cards are success and how man say fail)  the cards are flipped face down and suffled and you pick one and pray.  your rewarded with supplies, equipment, and gold and punished with curses, injuries, and loss of provisions or fights.  Various events will lead to the drawing of monster cards and suddenly your in an arena fending off enemies with arkham city style combat controls.  Then comes another clever twist. often completing challenges will unlock new cards at the end of the round.  you see the challenges you face and the equipment you might earn come from a deck that you can alter.  each round has a requires your equimpent deck and enconter deck to have a certin number of cards and you can swap out encounters or equimpent you don't want to chance coming across in favor of ones you like so you have some conrol of what you'll run into during the game, though the dealer will always shuffle in a set of his own cards to try and trip you up.And all the while the dealer taunts teases and converses with you.  He's really one of the main highlights of the game.  Its like playing a card game with Ron Peralman dressed as a masked wizard (no its not him but thats what the dealers voice reminds me of)This game reaks of charm and personality and i highly recomend it. The game play is simple but how its presented makes it into a unique experice.			"

												Combat is very similar to the Batman games, although not as fluid.  Still fun however.Metagame is presented to you as almost a form of Tarot reading.  There is really no exploration, just a series of random events in somewhat of a chain.  Also character progression is not normal, don't get too comfortable with a certain piece of gear.  Also, shields are your life.It seems deceptively easy at first, changes after you get a few bosses in.  Much more of a challenge in terms of both what you're facing and managing your resources.All in all, worth the price.			"

												This is a wonderfully made indie card game/action game.  This game is something I don't think has quite been done before.  You build your deck to determine what happens during a round and the mysterious dealer (who is wonderfully animated and voiced) lays traps and misfortunes for you, but he's not your enemy outright.  He plays more of a dungeon master role and lays out the game's story for you.  A lot of time was put into him, as he remembers what cards you used on previous playthroughs and remarks on your playstyle.  If you rely on the same card too often, he will laugh at you for using cheap cards as a crutch.  If you make the enemy deck too easy, he might add a few difficult cards to keep the game interesting.  He has a series of around 16-ish foes for you to challenge, each one harder than the last.You move your token and land on dealt out cards which determine the environment; then the environment comes to life and fights you in a fighting style remniscent of Arkham Asylum.  There are also trap sections you run through.  The animations during this sequence feel a little mechanical and the default difficulty is MUCH too forgiving.  You can just tap the attack button and win.  I recommend upping it to hard mode ASAP.  It causes all the run and hit animations to move faster, hiding some of the awkward motion during action sequences and keeping you engaged in the battle.The game has a great soundtrack with SFX that mirror what the card's effect on your character is.  The voice acting and animation of the cards and the dealer is fantastic.  A single game takes around 15-20 minutes depending on how fast you click through the UI, but there are challenge cards that you can throw in to handicap your character, adding to the replay value.An original idea executed better than any game on the Unity Engine I've seen thus far.  Worth playing. "

												I've gotten huge amounts of enjoyment out of this game. It delivers in every area that it promises and if you are looking for a bordgameesque rougelike this is for you.The game transitions from easy to very hard over the course of the game and there is little input from the player that can change the difficulty. For me this is not a problem as I enjoy the challenge, but for those looking for a game you can just walk through then you're probably not going to play to the end. Something that came as a big and very welcome surprise was the storytelling. Which is told by the dealer who'll comment on everything that is happening. At first I thought that this was going to be off-putting after a while. But even now 30+ hours into the game I still want to hear everything he has to say. Through cryptic and vague pieces of information the story is revealed to you and it feels great to gather up these tidbits of information. The voice-acting is spot on and the amount of different monologues are huge. As for gameplay there is a good balance between depth and simplicity. After a while you'll learn what encounter does what, but there is still a random element to each encounter that you as a player can influence. This lends to a big increase in replayability since even though you encounter the same stuff the outcomes will differ, and so will your experience during each playthrough.The game looks good as well. While the graphics are not AAA they are certainly conveying the feelings that the atmospehere in this game needs to flourish. It also runs very well (at least on my computer).Overall when it comes to atmosphere it's where this game shines the most. Thanks the combination of voiceacting and spot on artstyle you'll be drawn into the mysteries presented. You'll want to see what waits ahead, You'll want to push on further, You'll want to find out what awaits in the end, You'll want to understand. "

												Wow, what a truly wonderful surprise this game turned out to be. I picked it up on a whim without having any real knowledge of the game till it hit the market. It's a procedurally generated set of dungeons (akin to the old 'choose your own adventure' novels from  20+ years ago) based on cards in a deck that you have a hand in designing. You traverse this dungeon using gear from a separate deck that you also have a hand in designing, which is comprised of gear you found throughout your journey exploring previous dungeons. It's really quite genius.The game is surprisingly deep too. During play you'll see the following:-various weapon damage types-various enemy types-mazes-curses-blessings-merchants-buffs-traps-chests-path choices-bosses-magical items-random loot-artifacts-item activation during combatI'm sure theres more I could add, but I'm still not even 2hrs played. You walk across a board comprised of over turned cards from the deck, randomly laid out in a grid. Each step consumes a food resource, so must monitor your food as you travel. You'll run into decisions in  your journey...do you give some of your food away to a weary traveller? or just pass by them. How you respond will affect the outcome of your journey.While I was originally concerned combat during story mode was too simple. The further I got, Not only was I becoming stronger, but so was my enemy.I definitely recommend this game. It's new and refreshing. Well done!			"

Saturday morning fun.Hand of Fate...Already seems like it has the makings of a classic choose-your-own roguelike adventure, got it through a humble bundle a few months ago, very lucky for me indeed, or perhaps I should just be appreciative of Defiant's articulate and masterful work.The 'game/dungeoun-master' harkens back to classical wizards such as Merlin, G-dalf and the ilk without seeming cliched, in fact, he seems original and fresh; layers of Easternish mysticism are presented before you and his comments on your doings, comings and goings are quite enjoyable to hear. He may tell you that the blessing you just purchased is a bit imba and he's going to bring out the nerf-hammer next time around, the game does not mean it will actually nerf that blessing next time around, it is actually beating the final level per set of cards that will increase the strength of enemies encountered and also improve your starting gear and provisions. This guy is the only person you really interact with during the game, and that makes your adventure seem delightfully personal.In addition to that, the game is played with tokens to unlock more incredibly detailed cards, beautiful arenas, dungeouns, and shop-areas with little merchant wagons, all revolving around improving your character's odds as you move his little gold playing token through card-maps to the boss event for each set of cards. You may come across a random event where you must select from four shuffled cards, and yes, if your eyes are quick enough you can follow the successful cards as they shuffle, no true randomness involved, just have to pay attention to the minute details as the cards slide across eachother. Anywho, guess the correct cards in these events and you might get a new weapon, some gold or earn the card's token which will in turn, after beating the set boss, unlock more cards for you to play with your next time around.Everything comes together with such subtlety that you almost feel like you're experiencing more than you paid for, this title screams triple-A quality throughout every chapter and turn while still coming through as your humble guide leading you through a poignant adventure largely based on fantastical ideas that leave just enough space within their nooks and crannies to be able to be completely alluded to on a personal level for you and your imagination.

												It's kind of difficult to describe this game but the best way I know how to put it is that it's a bit of classic tabletop RPG mixed with a solid Arkham style combat mechanic and throw in a solid deck manager system sort of similar to something like Magic The Gathering. It's immersive and fun to say the least and for the price point you just can't beat it.			"

												If you put action combat in a card game, either do it well or don't do it at all. We have a good and somewhat boring card game with a terrible, awful, uninspired combat sequences. Game throws too many cards at you, too many to care about what they are. And regardless of difficulty (which is easy anyways) you end up drawing cards and playing guess-the-card to win (or loose). A touch of game progression redesign (and maybe even removing combat sequences, or making it scripted, e.g. pc resolving card game outcome in a spectacular scripted fight) and this game would become amazing gem.

												As of the time writing this review I've only scratched the surface of this truly endless game, where to begin!? Well I'll begin by saying this is a must have for any fans of those old school ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books or general RPG fans, when i first started playing I could see myself getting tired of the games formula extremly fast but alas I was very wrong, the amount of content in just the base game looks to be pretty staggering for the price and the combat system feels very Arkham game still (standard counter system) yes its not as fluid as the arkham games but it does hold up pretty well.The meat of the game is the cards themselves, each ""round"" cards from your deck and the mysterious gentleman's whom your up against get mashed together and them put down before you, there are different kinds of cards from situations, fights to items. All of which have an impact and following rounds, the goal is very simple.. Kill the end of ""level"" boss, but the beauty of the game is the sheer randomness at paly, you and I will or would have very different games each time we play, as such there is no real story but one crafted from each and every card on the table. there is just so much to say about this game and I've only played 1.4 hours in total, just get it already kay?..............Why are you still reading this? go, go now.. Buy it.			"

												Although it has its bugs (crashes on some Linux systems and I've got no sound due to a Unity bug), it's an inventive and clever take on two different genres:  card games and adventure RPG.  The dev seems receptive to working with people who are having trouble due to bugs, etc.  Even with the bugs, it's well worth checking out.			"

												I challenge anyone who plays tabletop D&D not to fantasize about a game like this. The modularity, genre, and the ongoing quest lines, woven together by the luck of the draw, are evokative of those games. Cross it, perhaps, with FTL style resource management and text adventure moments, done with fairly simple tools and models for this era (models and combat action are fairly standard for 5-10 years ago), but performed with pure style. Hand of Fate.I want to give particular props for the dealer, who is cryptic without seeming pretentious, vocal without being a nuisance, taps on the fourth wall without shattering it, and succeeds in striking a magnificent balance in which he has the character of both a menacing opponent and an impartial judge. Maybe that's part of what reminds me so much of D&D. He is remniscient of an excellent dungeon master who wants you to succeed; but not easily.I am a little annoyed that not only is there a pay-for expansion, but the base game has achievements that cannot be unlocked unless you buy it. Marks off for that, it's a disappointing choice. However, it's not enough of an annoyance to keep me from recommending the game.The difficulty seems well-rounded and fairly challenging to me. You certainly have plenty of opportunity to fail, but failure isn't all that punishing. I look forward to playing more.			"

												A unique experience with some very original ideas. The dealer's narration is excellent, ties together the mysterious atmosphere of the game perfectly. The deck building keeps things fresh, and acts almost like an open world in letting you choose what aspeects to explore next. I haven't finished the game, so I'm not 100% certain, but it feels like the small storylines told by the cards themselves don't connect to the overall storyline, but I think that works well. The writing is very short form, but it's all relatively engaging and even though they only appear for a short time some of the characters are pretty interesting. The fighting gameplay is significantly weaker than the rest of the game, but it plays smoothly enough and doesn't take up too much time. That said, honestly I think the game would have been better with some kind of card-based combat like (for example) Guild of Dungeoneering.			"

												The concept here is solid and easily creates a sense of adventure, exploration and suspense using surprisingly few and simple means to do it. Every new game feels like a quest to discover the next installment of any number of quest chains, and to gather up enough resources to be able to accomplish your goal when you get there, to avoid danger and peril that comes with venturing into the unknown and the mysterious.That said, I feel this game lacks polish and clear communication. In combat this is especially clear, the exact range in which you can attack or counterattack is extremely inconsistent and there have been times when my character will move or attack in the wrong direction and I will have no idea why. Out of combat also, the odds of success vary wildly with each encounter, sometimes an encouter offers three success and one failure, sometimes it offers three huge failures and one success, why? Is it because of some item im carrying? because it happened later in the game? You dont know! It would break the flow of the game to explain what detail is affecting each and every choice I make, but some sort of instruction here would be very helpful.8/10			"

												This game is better than a genre mashup like this has any right to be.The voiceworkfor on the dealer is perfect. He is about as good as the narrator from Darkest Dungeon, so if you enjoyed that, take a good look at Hand of Fate. You'll probably like it.Honestly, i can't understand why the trailer video on the top doesn't show off the dealer, he's amazing.Hand of Fate is unique, it's well written and a lot of fun. So maybe it's a bit unfair at times, but thanks to all the cards you unlock even on unsuccessful runs, you rarely think of games as a total defeat.Now if i could only suck less at the action parts, i might even be able to beat that damned King of Scales. God, i hate that guy...I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys card and/or board games. It also has plenty of potential to grow into an even better game once more expansions get released.			"

												Hand of Fate is a fantastic game.  It's like my sympathetic bro that I don't hang out with nearly enough, but when I do I'm like why don't we hang out all the time?  But then I'm like, oh, right, that's why.  Hand of Fate is special though, make no mistake.  It fills a void in gaming for me - when I'm in that place where I don't want to steal cars and hustle, hunt and kill ancient demons, or get deep into diplomacy while building a nation, Hand of Fate's got my back.  When I'm too hungover for ""normal"" games, too twitchy to play twitch shooters, and too high to die (or rather, too high to want to constantly have to worry about dying..), HoF has me covered.  It's casual and somehow still challenging.   It's a special kind of game, and certainly deserves your time,.			"

												Really interesting blend of mechanics that has some implementation problems (I go into it in the spoiler senction). The roguelike aspect, the deckbuilding aspect, the choose-your-own-aventure aspect and the third person brawler aspect all blend toghether really well. Yes, the game is not the best one in any of these mechanics, so if you don't like the whole package you'll find a better experience elsewhere. Maybe Batman, Binding of Isaac or The Yawgh.Performance wise it's not a heavy game but, since all the cards are individual models and are manipulated several times by the Dealer, it might choke on a few points on lower end computers.This would be alongside my favorites if it wasn't for some (really bad) late game decisions.SPOILER SECTION....The final boss is a complete joke. I problably spent half of my gameplay hours on him. It ramps up the dificulty, but not in a good way. The dificulty of the final level is that it slowly chips away at your health and abilities with a curse at every stage and the inability to aquire blessings (this can be changed if you're lucky and has the proper cards).The final boss is a gauntlet of all previous bosses, separetad by enemy type. This woul be easy if the three plague bosses wheren't so OP. The king and the jack have a small window of vulnerabillity and they usually stunlock you and take a lot of health, the king specially. The problem is not defeat them, but to do so without loosing much health.Between matches with the previous bosses the Dealer unleashes some magical attacks and there's a QTE. The last one is my main death reason because it's really hard to dodge all of them. It can easilly hit you for 40+ hp and with your health already chipped away by all the previous bosses... you got the picture.The cheap way around it is to kill the game before dying. The game saves just before the fight for crash prevention purposes. That way you don't have to pass through all the maze again. Hell, if you're feeling particularly cheap you can do that every time  something bad happens to you so you arrive at the last battle in better condition. "

												This is one of those rare gems that really gets my attention.The concept is magnificent, blurring the lines as to whether you're someone playing a card game or an adventurer trapped in a game itself. The narration by the dealer is wonderful, some of the best voice acting I've heard in a while and it perfectly fits the setting. The art on both the cards and the game itself is excellent, evoking a fantasy world where the line between reality and imagination is a thin one indeed. I finished the first challenge and popped out long enough to write this, but I am most certainly diving right back in as soon as I do.The whole game feels like something out of an old fairy tale, or perhaps something that a writer like Neil Gaiman would create. I can see myself spending a LOT of time with this one.I do have a couple minor quibbles, but that's not with the game itself so much as the fact that it seems Steam is a bit weird with it just yet. I opened the Steam Dashboard during gameplay, but the top and bottom parts of the dashboard remained when I returned to it. There's a couple issues with the PC it seems yet, but as this game just came out I don't doubt they'll be fixed in short order.All in all if you're a fan of high fantasy and want something that really scratches that itch this game is definitely on the top of my list to recommend to you. Well done indeed.http://lenwolfgamer.tumblr.com/post/143147574202/hand-of-fate "

												Have you ever wondered whqat could be the incestuous child of a CCG, a RPG qnd q Beqt'em All ?Guess no more, it's sold on that very page :You have a collection of cards and chose some of them before each level.These cards are added to the dealer's (NPC) and placed on the table.Your character hops from card to card, thus triggering their (sometimes random) events.If you have to fight mobs it will be in a small arena with the equipment you built during the level.It's very fun, sarisfying and well paced.Moreover the difficulty system is very well done with stable difficulties ranging from ""lil' stroll"" to ""My♥♥♥♥♥got-beaten-so-hard-I-can-whipe-my-tears-with-my-buttcheeks"".PS: all of this is VERY subjective and my not so little taste for this kind of games might make me a bit to enthusiastic. BUT BUY IT IT'S COOL.			"

												A little of many different styles put together into a fantastic presentation.  The dealer is as charismatic as he is enigmatic.  The game is paced perfectly to keep making want to play ""one more game"".  The combat is the only sore spot that I've found so far.  It tries the arkham fighting style, but the animations are not optimized for it.  It looks off, but plays well.  Again, it's paced well, so the flaw is quickly forgotten.			"

												Yes the combat is average, but I find it passable.  The rest of the game is full of great atmosphere and the dealer is quite entertaining.  By the time you get to the last few levels his dialog does get reused a bit to much.  It is also quite RNG heavy so if thats not your cup of tea I would pass.  However I recommend it especially if you can get it on sale.			"

So far i don't even know why it is there, this looks like a complete game to me! If i would compare this game i would compare it to D&D with the difficulty setting of Dark Souls.

The combination between a rpg, hackslash game and a card game made me verry wonder how it would turn to be. But after reading some comments and by finaly playing it myself, i got addicted right away!

												This is a unique game with great presentation.  Do you like card games?, do you RPGs?, do you like 3rd person action games.  If so, this game is definitely for you.  BUT it is waaaaay easier to play with a gamepad, I play with a wired xbox controller.  The keyboard is too clumsy to really enjoy playing this game.  The best part of the game is the card dealer, the voice acting and the ambience make this game.  You need to understand that I am cheap...I am a frugal bast*rd and I think $20 is worth it for this game.  I am the guy that only buys games on sale in the sub $5 and I can honestly say that this game is worth the price.Once you play you are looking forward to seeing what new cards are going to be thrown your way.  You ask yourself if you want to get more food, gold, or health?  What new monsters will I see in the next phase of the game.			"

												I have only played Hand of Fate for a few hours but it has made a great impression.  It brings back the old pen and pencil D&D memories and it is brilliant fun.  its simple to grasp and so far hasnt been diifficult to progress, however it is hinting at more complicated gameplay and decisions to be made later down the line which i am looking forward to, such as as having enough food to explore the dungeon/scenario versus just try and find the exit.  I really like the change in gameplay between making slower decisions and taking a random pot luck (dice roll) on choosing a card, to using skill in faster paced combat.  the combat, is so far, a somewhat simplified batman/shadow of mordor type where the character can block and counter attack (equipment dependant) as well as using special cards that have been chosen. It isnt without issues, the intro video has some textural issues and after using the steam overlay in game i ended up with a letter box display, however none of the issues have been for me game breaking.   The actual gameplay however has been bug free so far.			"

												I have played a few hours of this game....does not make me an expert but it is the sort of game that you get the feel of very quickly. First, the collect and upgrade aspect is a lot of funSecond, the combat is fun enough to keep you interested. Think the Batman games but not as in depth.Third, the voice acting is so perfect for this game. Fits the mood and sets the atmosphere so well.Fourth, The game play for the ""dungeon crawling"" part of the game is simple but very effective.Fith, the fact that some of the dungeon encounter card get to have different outcomes makes the game very replayable.I have enjoyed this game in the 3 hours I have played it and I intend to keep playing it for a while to come. I would hope that in the future Defiant will add more classes to play with and maybe more objective sets to play with.Thanks for making such a fun game.			"

Combat is simple to pick up and borrows heavily from recent Batman titles. Overall a highly recommend - check it out!   "

												This is a great game. When i first saw screenshots of it i wasn't immediately drawn to it. But picking this up in the summer sale I don't regret it and would easily say its worth its full price. I can only hope they will do a sequel. What really rounds this game off is the voice over (think Michael Caine-like) of the card dealer whom has a think or two to say about your choices and what has happened as you make choices and at times try your luck. And there is random luck involved where sometimes you can lose a prized weapon or artifact from that.  You have a series of boss fights if you will per game. So each game could last from twenty or so, perfect for those casual gamers who want to play in short bursts.  As you defeat more foes at the end of a game you unlock more cards and events.  It is a simple game to play but really pulls you in. And as i said i hope the developer has plans on a sequel.			"

												Marvelous game!The concept is really nice: building and collecting your own deck, playing the cards and eventually fighting the actual encounters in 'batman' style gameplay. The different cards are always meaningfull and contain many surprises. There is always that positive 'pull' to play on and try to unlock a card's token to see what the next event will be.I have backed this one on Kickstarter and I'm glad I did, money well spent!The only downside is in the balancing. The first rounds are extremely easy. The final rounds are very hard and the last one is just impossible to the extend that it turns into a restart-restart-restart session which removes all of the fun. A random encounter puts you against 2 end-bosses of previous levels while the final fight makes you fight all endbosses all over again. The fights in itself are not so bad, but combined with an endless amount of curses it makes the level way too hard, at least for me.The game has a lot of replay-ability thanks to the random draw effect and the customizeable deck. But the repeated attempts at the final level made me lose interest.Overall I give it a 7/10. Great game, unique concept and a lot of fun. This can turn into a 9/10 if they rebalance the final level a bit.			"

												Good, but not great. The concept is awesome, I love how it intertwines a dungeon crawler with a card game. At the beginning it's very nice and fun to play, but when you get closer to the endgame the RNG becomes too punishing, robbing you of a chance to use your skills and instead tunring events into a slot machine of sorts. Well, it's not called ""hand of fate"" for nothing, I guess, but it makes the endgame a little too grindy.Encounter and item cards get unlocked very quickly, which makes the game rather short, even though there is an endless mode - it's just not very fun to play if there's no element of exploration, you learn the cards fast and know what they do and how it's best to approach encounters. Hopefully, future addons and DLC will fix that by adding more cards.This is a good title to grab during a sale, it will keep you occupied for a couple of evenings, but not for much longer than that. It can be so much better; seeing the great potential of this game makes it feel a bit underwhelming in its current state. I hope that it will get there eventually.			"

If you like playing adventure games, text based adventures (this reminds me of them), and looking for something new, this is for you then! If they keep releasing new cards/quests as either free updates, paid DLC, or in game purchases, then I think this game can stay great for a long time. As long as the prices are right (don't get full of yourselves devs), then I'd pay anywhere from .99 to $5 for an expansion pack or something similar; as long as contains the content to back that up.

												Great atmosphere supported by the dealer and using new cards to explore dungeons adds fun to each playthrough. My only gripe is walking into both the queen and jack of plague, or 2x the 6 of plague on a tiny trap filled battlefield. It's near impossible to dodge or counter everything, and you end up getting combo'd to death without any chance to fight back. I wish the maps would grow larger the more enemies you fight instead of being seemingly random irregardless of how many you are facing.			"

												First off, the melee Scales (Lizardmen as they're called) are bs. Other than that, this game is amazing. The rouge-like atmosphere helps keep the game fresh, and with every new card you get from card tokens, it makes the story bigger. Card tokens can either give you weapons/armor/story or all of the above. This game has a lot of luck and faith. It can read your mind when you internaly beg to not land on a certain card, and it'll give you the double middlefinger and have it right there. With that in mind, if you do over come that obsticle, it feels really rewarding to beat that unwanted challenge and gain card tokens (until you land on the next unwanted card). This game can get hard at times. but you can always try something new. You can change what cards you want to use, be it story or equipment, giving you different ways to attempt to clear a story boss. All in all, this game is really addicting and really easy to get into. 9/10 would rip my own heart out of my chest again.			"

												Extremely Creative. This game has truely been made outside the box. As a fan of card games (specifically deck-builders) this game has shown me just how fun this concept can be. Not quite a card game but yet not quite a true action game, This game lies somewhere in the middle. The graphics are charming and the music is perfect for the grim environment in which you play your last game for life and death. Each new game becomes deeper and more creative and makes it harder and harder to quit playing. The personality of the demon (not sure what else to call him) that you are playing against is extremely well made. His voice, animations, and scripts are all so well done. This is truely a great game to play and I hope this concept gets expanded on in the future. Hand of Fate shows that it can be done well. Easily worth the price tag!			"

												This game... Oh my, is it good. I finally finished story mode, so I feel like I can give an educated opinion now, so lets get down to the details.Hand of fate is a mixed card game and action RPG. On their own they are both average at best, but they complement and enhance each other very well. You have two decks (Sets of cards, for those not familiar with the lingo): The equipment deck and the encounter deck. The encounter deck will be used by The Dealer to construct the levels you play on, along with the cards he add himself to help and/or screw you over. These cards can be everything from a shop to buy and sell items in, to assisting (alleged) druids with their rituals. You start the game standing on a card, and you can move to any adjecent card to get closer to the boss so you can beat it and win the game. Every card is initially hidden, so you have no idea what awaits you before you move to and flip a card (certain items can reveal cards under certain conditions, though). A session consists of several levels, which are each constructed by a bunch of the encounter cards. For exampls 10 cards can build up a level, and one of these cards will be a travel card which lets you travel to the next level, where more cards will be used to construct it. Every encounter card can also have a golden symbol on it, which means that if you handle the encounter card in a certain way (usually defeating the monsters or getting another positive outcome), you will unlock more encounter and/or equipment cards. The equipment cards in your deck are the cards you will be able to obtain during a session. You can gain these by completing encounters in certain ways, or buying them at shops. As you complete more encounters you will, as mentioned earlier, obtain more equipment cards. This increases your potential power for each subsequent session (you start every session with basic equipment, although you can obtain better starting gear as you progress in story mode). Like the Encounter deck, the dealer can also add cards to the equipment deck. Equipment comes in seven different types: Weapons, shields, armor, helms, gloves, artifacts and trinkets (I suspect they are all rings as I haven't seen other types yet, but the category is called trinkets. Possibly for DLC down the line?). You can use one of each at a time, except for trinkets who are all active as long as you own them. Equipment can have both passive and active effects. The exception are artifacts, who only have activated abilities (they are your spells, basically). There are two different modes: Story and Endless mode. Story mode will put you up against one of the bosses of the game (SPOILER:::::: The last boss forces you to fight every single boss in the game, three at once four times :::::ENDSPOILER). In story mode you'll start with certain curses and The Dealer will add certain cards himself to your different decks as mentioned earlier. Usually these will be encounter cards. It is possible to just play a story session with almost any kind of deck (as long as it's not outright terrible), but specializing your deck for the stuff The Dealer will throw at you is probably a good idea unless you're like me and put as many ""unfinished"" encounters you can into your deck to unlock more cards more quickly (warning: this will likely result in a lot of rage as you try to unlock more stuff, fail, and get screwed over for the session).I have yet to play a lot of Endless mode, as Story mode kept me occupied for a while (I've slept with my computer running the game and such, though, so take hours/played with a *grain* of salt). From what I can see, you don't get to construct your deck here (you use all your cards), and the session continues until you die. In addition every time you travel to a new level of the session the dealer will throw in more bad things you have to deal with (feel free to correct me in the comments if I'm wrong, and I'll update it. I'll play Endless mode more now that I finished Story mode myself, though). As you start without any curses, it's probably an excellent way to go for unlocking encounter cards. Speaking of curse cards. There are two kinds of cards I haven't mentioned yet: Curses and Blessings. These are persistant effects that will buff or debuff you for the duration of the session (or, rarely, until a condition is fulfilled and it fires). Examples here can be spending food to counterattack, but doubling counter attack damage (a curse), or a lightning bolt striking down one enemy at the start of each combat (a blessing). Curses are usually really expensive to get rid of (at least the ones you start with), and blessings are expensive for their cost to obtain, and have varying levels of use. You could get a blessing which won't be of any use for an entire run, or a curse you will barely notice. On the other hand, you could also get really powerful ones which will be a great boon, or completely screw you over. Whew, ok, only a few mechanics left to mention now. In addition to what's already been mentioned, you also have health, food and gold. You start with 100/100 health, and both your current and maximum health can change during the course of the run. Current health can be knocked down both by encounters, and by taking damage during combat. You spend 1 food every time you move, and if you run out of food every movement will cost you 10 health points. Gold is simply used to buy things at shops (equipment, blessings, removing curses, food, etc.). All these resources can be refilled through encounters, or purchased at different types of shops (selling in the case of gold).The combat itself is a very simple Batman ish combat system. You attack and counter attack, and can dodge roll. You can also use the activated abilities of your different items. The combat itself can feel a bit sluggish (animations are a bit slow), but the controls are VERY responsive, and I hardly ever felt like I didn't avoid something which shouldn't have hit me. Combat itself can be triggered during an encounter card, and you will draw from the dealers monster deck whenever combat has been initiated by an encounter (although what strength/kind of monsters you can draw is usually decided by the encounter card). Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah I recommend this game. It might peter out a bit after you finished the story mode and start just screwing around in endless mode (I don't know yet, although I've yet to unlock all the encounter cards), but so far it's been a LOT of fun. That said, it can be ridiculously hard towards the later story sessions (it starts out easy, though). If you don't mind the difficulty you should definitely take it for a ride. I'd be very surprised if you end up regretting it!If you didn't like something about the review, or felt some information is lacking, feel free to drop a comment! If you felt this review helped you come to an informed decision, I'd very much appreciate a helpful rating. If you felt this isn't helpful at all, you can of course vote it down, but I'd appreciate being told what you feel is wrong so I get an opportunity to change my review if your points are valid.

												Probably one of the best blends of multiple genres there is. The game is, so far, incredibly fun and addictive with the Rouge-like mechanics, random encounters, card collecting, RPG loot system, choose your own adventure, and Table Top card game style. The combat, while fairly simple, resembles the Arkham style and it does it well. For the price I paid ($19.99 because of a sale), I highly recommend it, even at the base price of $24.99 or your regional equivalent.My only 2 gripes with the game are1. The fixed camera can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in some encounters, especially ones envolving quite a lot of enemies2. sometimes the game fails to register the correct direction I'm aiming when using ranged abilities. Though, I can forgive it seeing how you'll be using melee combat 90% of the time.These small blemishes can easily be fixed, so I do hope they are. Granted, I'm playing on a keyboard, and not a controller as recommened. However, fixing these issues could make keyboard perfectly viable (though it pretty much is already, in my opinion).I'd give this a solid 9/10 at the moment.my thoughts so far:High replayabilityUnique set-up with the mixing of genresFun and simple, yet challenging combatThe camera is a bit of a nuisance at times.While I don't have much time in the game thus far; I shall update my review accordingly and as with any game, I advise looking up more information about the game and make sure it's something you'd be interested in. I personally love it so far, but opinions may vary.			"

												Insane!! This game is amazing!! It's basically a roguelike with a card builder, but is so more than that!! If my description intrigue you buy this game!! Bro..., BUY THIS GAME!!I don't cross with any failure yet, nothing more than a minor glinch with the card dealer. (His hands turn black)In summary, remind me my early days of card games and the Steve Jackson's Fantasy books.Do you buy it already?  "

												Controller necissary. Not recommended, but *necissary*. As the combat gets harder, you won't survive via mouse-button mashing and pounding your AWDS keys in a feutal attempt to get your hero to stop running into walls, slash things in the right direction or block the correct monster.Other than these wonkey console-based controls/fighting instead of mouse-driven persepctive (PC) fighting... the game is awesome fun. It has surprises, the replaybility is huge and I'm enjoying the banter from the dealer.			"

												Hand of Fate is unlike any other game I've played. It's a mix between D&D, Boulder's Gate, and MTG with very clean graphics, gameplay, and story progression. The element of luck in this game is what really spices it up. Though I don't think this game is worth $25.00 USD, if you can get it on sale you won't regret it.

												Hand of Fate is something really quite special. Cards become a dungeon as they're laid out on the table before you. With each step another card is turned over to reveal another encounter, each feeling like they've been taken straight from the pages of a choose-your-own-adventure book.The dealer sitting opposite you engages in amusing and intriguing banter, alternating between challenging and encouraging you, threatening to make the game more deadly at every turn, and hinting at the secrets behind the mysterious game you're playing with him.It's a fantastic setting for a game, and quite a difficult one as the dealer keeps to his word and throws tougher creatures, harsher traps, cruel encounters and a seemingly endless array of painful curses to stop you in your tracks with every round you playAt times it can get a little frustrating. Being a card game, you can tweak your deck with favourable encounters, but sometimes that's not enough to prevent a string of bad encounters early on which can bring a game to a swift end. Couple this with some encounters being simple games of chance, and at times it feels like you've lost without really playing badly.Thankfully this doesn't happen too often, and with each conquered challenge rewarding you with new cards, even a failed adventure can net you some new toys.And if you really dislike having so much RNG in your game, you can stack the deck in favour of combat encounters to help limit the amount of dice rolling.The combat, however, is probably the weakest part of this game. It's a straightforward affair, a watered down version of the free-flowing combat in the Batman Arkham series. It works just fine and can get quite challenging, and there's a vast array of weapons, armour and trinkets to aid you, but I feel like it needs a few more options to keep it interesting. All you can really do is attack, block, guard-break, dodge, and occasionally use a trinket or a weapon's special ability. I wouldn't expect the immense depth the Arkham games have but I think it's a little too simple here.For the most part, the game looks and runs just fine. Personally I find the art style quite appealing and fairly unique, but I suppose some people might find it a little too simplistic for their tastes. I have encountered a few graphical glitches however, such as pink boats and monsters' limbs stretching like elastic, as well as a couple of freezes that forced me to restart the game. Nothing remotely serious or common enough to warrant a major complaint, but it's a very rewarding experience when you let yourself get immersed in the adventure, and those sorts of minor irritants draw you out from it.In summary: A wonderfully entertaining card game/dungeon crawl/choose-your-own-adventure experience with a few minor issues. A little simplistic in its combat and sometimes a little heavy on the RNG, but these minor gripes are a small price to pay for such a unique game with a sinister, secretive adversary who raises the stakes with every round. It does get quite challenging as your progress, so don't expect an easy ride.			"

												Hand of Fate is quite the interesting game, some visual issues and crashes but rare enough to be ignored since the game itself is so good.You build your deck with equipment and encounters that will then be used to randomly generate a dungeon. As you suceed with the encounters you unlock more of them, as well as equipment, making you want to see every 'quest line' through.With the DLC it adds classes, whom also come with their own storylines to even further give you reasons to replay the game and unlock everything.

												I bought this game as early access.  The original releases were promising, but were riddled with balance issues - as one would expect from a raw development release.  But the premise, as everyone has said, was intreiguing. Defiant Development have always created games that put a new angle on a well trod genre, but Hand of Fate seems to be more than that.  The release version was an amazing surprise in comparison to the last development release - smooth, polished, mostly balanced.  There are still wild swings of too easy to WTFBBQSAUCE hard, but much of that comes down to luck of the draw.  Seeing as luck pretty much is the premise and title of the game, one cant really complain about it too much.  That said, the unpredictability didn't detract from my failing miserably and wanting to rerun to get a different set of cards and different luck.			"

												It's very pretty, and I'd like to see what all the encounters do... maybe I gave up too early, but I played through the first five story mode adventures on hard difficulty without dying or even coming particularly close, and that makes discovering new equipment or artifacts rather less exciting if I can just win with my starting rusty axe. Maybe I'll repurchase it sometime to see if the combat bits get more interesting later on, but for now I have better things to do. If you like Batman-style combat and good mood-setting I'd suggest at least picking it up to see if it works for you. "

												This game is quite the clever idea, and an entertaining game most of the time. Its difficulty curve is quite puzzling, though. After the initial ""tutorial"" hands and you start the game proper, it gets quite tough. However, when you succeed at the quests on the cards you find, you unlock new gear and bonuses which you can acquire later and on future playthroughs, and you can modify your deck (a lot easier than it sounds and not at all complicated or annoying, and this is coming from someone who typically tries to avoid alchemy and crafting in pretty much every game it's possible to avoid). The difficulty isn't so bad when you do this...until you reach the last few sections of the game. The fifteenth boss/level you take on (King of Plagues) is simply unacceptable on the normal difficulty, which is what I had played up until that point, and it was quite a challenge all the way until that section became impassable for me.Speaking of which, there is an ""easy mode"" you can access by going to the DLC menu (Fates) in the Deck Builder. While almost all of them are things you have to pay for, the normal difficulty and the easy mode (labeled as ""Apprentice"") can be chosen there, and it gives you a ton of bonuses/perks for your character to aid him in getting further. At that point, though, easy was far too easy on the fifteenth level, while I couldn't come close to completing it on normal. Beyond that point, I stuck with the Apprentice difficulty because it didn't seem to get any easier.The combat is essentially like a simpler version of the Arkham games' combat, with a number of abilities you can activate (only 2 can be taken into any given battle) depending on your gear. The battles get truly ruthless and not particularly fun late-game on normal. Even if I could handle the battles at max health, the problem is that the cards you draw along the way will hinder you even further. While you do have cards which can aid you, the bad cards very often outweigh the good.All that said, I was able to complete the game's last few bosses/levels on the Apprentice setting, and some of the late-game stuff is surprisingly challenging, even on that difficulty. Unless you like showing off, I would highly recommend playing the Apprentice difficulty because the normal one just becomes a chore to play. It's a good game, but the difficulty settings are pretty screwy, so be warned of that.Oh...and the ending after you land the final blow is maybe 10 seconds long and only six words are spoken after that blow. If short/lame endings put you off, you may wish to take that into consideration.			"

The combat is not quite on Arkham's level, but is still challenging and has enough depth to keep encounters interesting.It is thankfully one of the few Early Access games that deserves to be on Steam, and four hours in I have not seen anything missing other than some sound effects that will probably get added in later.

Regardless, this game spurs the Tabletop RPG lover in me, the deck builder is me, and Especially the Arkham City lover in me too. It's quick to get into and even when all luck is against you and the game unfairly beat you into the ground, it is very easy and satisfying to be able to modify your deck and jump back into the same adventure with minimal downtime, making it a shining example of what a rougelike game can truely be.

								Another early access game. I've grown pretty weary of them, and I'm sure some of you reading this have too. I was first introduced to Hand of Fate on ""James Recommends"" from Extra Credits. I was interested in the concept, but I'd been burnt one too many times by great sounding ideas that were still a glimmer in their developer's eye. The price-tag made me think twice to boot. $25 for another unfinished game sounded like more of a risk than I wanted to take.Weeks went by, and I kept finding myself looking at the store page. Glancing over the screenshots and reading the game concepts. It just seemed so cool! Long story short I bit the bullet and bought the game. This one is for real! Even unfinished it promises an easy 25+ hours of entertainment. (For me at least, your milage may vary depending on your luck and skill.)I love the narration. I love the way the card game is woven into the fabric of a story that you make your own. The writing is crafty and thrilling and nostalgic somehow. This game sets the standard for early access games. It is fully playable with the promise of more content and refinement to come. If you find yourself drawn back to the idea this game proffers time and again, I highly recommend you pick it up.			"

Early Access Review
								So far, a really great Beta. Certainly one of the better Early Access titles that I've played in terms of content and completed gameplay. In the game, you play as a pawn in a dealer's game. You have a choice to move between cards and randomly attack enemies, complete tasks (the success of which depends on your draw), visit shops, and gain equipment. The gameplay is less card game (which I think people might surmise from the title) and more of a 3rd person action game with ""Chance"" components. The graphics are well-suited to the game and have good art direction. The voice-overs (when present) are good and add to the atmosphere. The only (exceptionally mild) complaint I have is that the controls seem somewhat ""floaty"" at times. More along the lines of ""Fable"" or ""Kingdoms of Amalur"". It tends to snap to enemies in a slow way, and as such combat seems as though it's in slow-motion. This is a matter of personal preference and really doesn't detract from an otherwise wonderful game. As a recommendation to the developers, it would be nice also to hit enemies on the ground. In my playtime it didn't appear this was possible, which seems off given that enemies spend a lot of time knocked down. I don't know if this is meant to keep fights more balanced, but it's a mechanic that I think would help speed up combat without lowering health or boosting character stats.Great game, and I'm glad to see it's shaping up so nicely!

								Great concept, good game.I really like the concept of this game, there are still some things not implemented and polished, but as it is in early excess that's to be expected. Even as it in in Early Access, it's really far in completion. I found 1 Card that does not have a design yet (being 7.5 hours in the game), but that doesn't have an impact on the game itself. And that's all the ""bugs"" i found so far, no crashing, no obious placeholders or any of this things you find in a lot of early access games.The mix of genre here is really unique (i've never seen a game simular to this one). Usually in a kind of Rogue-like experience you would depend on a lot of luck. Here is also skill in combat involved, which i really appreciate and like.If you consider to buy the game i would say if you like the concept (probably watch a youtube-video before) go ahead, because it is already so far done that you can find a good couple of hours fun in it. Keep in mind it is early Access, so if you are not sure about it, wait until it is finished.			"

								An all-around excellent game! It combines excellently-presented stories with combat reminiscent of the timing-based Batman Arkham series' combat, all under a roguelike engine. It is still actively in development at the time of my review, but I only see it getting better!			"

								a very interesting spin on normal TCG's not your average RPG or TCGif you are looking for something a bit different give it a try~Key Features~ * Tabletop card game brought to vivid life. ~ Okay let's think this through a little bit it is very very interesting concept and the swap between tabetop cards and more ands on Combat at times is Ingenious* A unique take on roguelike gameplay. ~ every game is Different is the general concept of 'roguelike' to begin with having not many cards it makes the rounds or games feel almost identical* Visceral action-RPG combat. ~ Yeah i can agree with that combat is for me quite nice ( lovely little surprise the first time it poped up for me)  sometimes though camera angle and controls are a little annoying* Game changing gear and items make every play through unique. ~ as meantioned not really much unique gear to begin with as was one of my gripes before* Hundreds of encounters, items, armor, weapons, artifacts, and mysteries to unlock. ~ in the begining like i have meantioned.... not too many variation * Unique deck building mechanics let you customise your own adventure, as you seek to defeat the Jack, Queen and King of each suit. ~ well yes can't dispute that one			"

								I've only played one hour so far, but despite very minor graphical errors, this game really impressed me.  I went in totally blind, not reading any reviews prior, and so every new aspect was a surprise.  The gameplay is more complex than it first lets on, but it eases you into it in a way that you can follow what's going on.  If my opinion changes the more I play, I'll modify this review.Watch me play it at http://www.twitch.tv/gamergrill/b/607887692 "

Early Access Review
								so. this game has a cool premise, pretty much as advertised. the dealer lays out a dungeon, made from seperate encounters, each represented by a card. these encounters are either just text decisions like ""give peasant half or all of your food"" and you have to guess, being either rewarded or punished afterwards. this card-dungeon is rogue-lite-challenging, meaning you can just starve because of plain bad luck with your draw and event choices. the other encounters, Id say about sixty percent - are the action rpg part of the game. the combat system is the weakest link in the chain still, and every single type of ranged enemy still has the potential to make me ragequit - but itll have you on your toes at least...in my opinion, the dealer animations in between cards are too long and unskippable. a lot of events determine their outcome by having you draw from four cards, say success/success/failure/huge failure. itll then show you these four, flip them, shuffle them TWICE (!), spread them out, pause a split second more just to annoy you further - and THEN you can draw one of the four. which youll do every thirty seconds. similar stuff goes for other animations, say the laying out of the dungeon in the beginning.besides from these problems, and early-access-issues like say, lack of sounds, the game is cool. the mix is a cool idea, and you can build your dungeon event AND equipment decks in between dungeons, that determine what stuff you might face off against, get benefited by, or loot.

I agree with other reviewers of this game that has an adventure book feel. The The wizard darws encounters, and if you win those encounters he draws equipment, and blessing cards from his deck. his commentary and the tail that ensues is very charming.Any fan of tabletop gaming will love this game. The wizard even uses tokens for crying out loud.			"

												I am absolutely in love with this game. It takes deck building, choose-your-own-adventure, board games, Arkham-style brawling and roguelite elements and mixes them all into a melting pot, and the atmosphere is the final ingredient that brings it all together. You're essentially playing through an adventure, using a deck of cards as the base, with the dealer providing colorful commentary and setting the mood. It's like playing a personal, one-on-one game of DnD with someone...or like old shows like Knightmare or similar. I can not overstate how impressive the atmosphere is of the game, with each card full of flavor and every encounter interesting and exciting. You never know what you'll find! The dealer himself is a very interesting character, who half the time seems to want to help you and half the time seems happy to watch you twist in the wind. He'll applaud you for victory, but just as quickly savor your defeat. Maybe you decide to swap out an axe for a sword? He'll snark about it, asking you if it's really what you want to do. His commentary, though sometimes cryptic, does an immense job in building the world and turns every card into a fully fleshed encounter, dripping with detail. Every monster, enemy and boss is played up with description, sometimes terrifying and sometimes mournful. Honestly, I have no complaints about this game at all and have had no issues or bugs with it...at least so far. Some of the RNG can get truly brutal in the later encounters and the combat itself isn't exactly door-busting, but it's more than servicable and for anyone who's played the Arkham games, Assassin's Creed or the like will find it easy to learn, though the difficulty ramps up greatly. I can already see this being one of my favorite games of the year. I sincerely hope they intend to release more content for it, as I'd love that, though between the Story mode and Endless Mode, I can see playing this for a long while yet.			"

Don't want to read the wall of text below? Watch my first look of Hand of Fate here. 


YouTube™ Video: Huge Success! - First 40 of Hand Of Fate (Gameplay) 

			Views: 36		

			40 Minutes of Gameplay from Hand of Fate Much like my last video of Ziggurat, Hand of Fate is a hard game to categorize with its card game/brawler/D&D mix, yet comes highly recommended.		

Much like most of the other great games that have come out this year so far, Hand of Fate is one of those that could have easily slipped through the cracks. It is a difficult game to categorize, but it's mix of card game mechanics, brawling and table top RPG mechanics proves to mix together very well. Let's break down each part and see how it stacks up.The Card Game -Easily the best part of this game. When I heard this was a card game I went into it expecting something along the lines of Hearthstone, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Your deck controls what is in each level, and gives you equipment. the dealers deck on the other hand (heh card puns) contains the monsters you fight, the prizes and punishments from encounters, and a few cards just to mess with you. Its very unique and very addictingThe Brawling -Easily the worst part of the game. It's not bad, but if you have played Shadow of Mordor then this is going to feel quite clunky. The combat is just imprecise and the trap level that all depend on movement are hard to navigate. It should be noted though that its not BAD, just could have used some more polish and seems rushed compared to the rest of the game.The RPG Side -Much of the game comes down to what are essentially dice rolls from D&D, though in this case is a card pick. This is what ties the whole game together. With this system even playing the same deck time and time again will give you a different playthrough. It is a deep system and allows for almost infinite replayability, and in a time where games are getting bashed for not having replayability  *cough* The Order *cough* its good to see.Hand of Fate is easily one of my favorite games of the year so far, and I highly recommend picking it up is you have any interest in card games.

												Absolute gaming bliss! The game is something I've never really encountered before, and I've been gaming for most all of my life. It's a card game crossed over with a dungeon crawler type RPG, and it meshes together perfectly. I was kind of weary about buying this at first (considering I've never really encountered this genre of game before) but trust me, just pay up the $25 dollars because you will NOT regret it. The game itself is SUPER addicting and keep begging me to play more and more even though I've only gotten past the first string of boss decks. I'm particularly amazed by how many lines of dialogue the dealer has. It’s as if you’re actually sitting across from him playing this game of which your life depends. It’s truly an immersive experience and I have not one complaint about the game. However, I do have one concern. What happens when you collect all of these cards and defeat all of these bosses? Will the developers implement some kind of DLC into the game to lengthen the time of play? I really don’t want this game to end but there are only 11 boss decks, and I’m already at deck number 5 after playing for about an hour and a half. There is however and “endless” game mode, which to my knowledge is probably a survival type mode of the game. However, I feel like this would make the game more of a “quick fix” type game, and not really the immersive adventure/card game it is in story mode, but who am I to say, I haven’t even tried it out. Anyways, final verdict, buy it, now, TENOUTTATEN!			"

												Rating Scale: Offensive Unfun Fair Good EnthusiasticHand of Fate is a breath of fresh air in the Rogue-like game style. The exploration point is fun, the challenge is descent, and the rewards for playing are surprisingly well thought out. You are a warrior, who has traveled far, and have meet a person, which is The Dealer. He has spent time making cards. Cards based off your memories. The game takes place on a board fashioned by these upside cards. As you play the game, you unlock and discover more memories, in which you get to go in and briefly explore. It's part Choose your own Adventure, part arcade smash them up, part resource management, and the key feature is the deck building.The deck building is a fascinating part of the game, and hints at a deeper story. You disover new magic weapons and abilities, and they go into one deck, and in the other deck are events. Often these events have a token which you can earn by running into it and passing the challenge. Pass the challenge, you get rewarded with a new card, a new memory from your past. So, the better you do, and the more tokens you unlock, the more story gets revealed.Is the story a deep one? Is it a good one? I can't say. I've not uncovered enough. I'm kinda struggling in the middle of the game not to starve to death, but that's a good thing. It's really random how the cards are distributed after a few levels, and if you overplay events, the game takes notice and changes them up. So it pays to change your deck every now and then. It also helps to have a good eye, as part of the game is three card Monte, and if you are good at spacial awareness, you can keep track of cards as they are shuffled, which is useful.Overall, this game is well worth the price of admission. The Journey is worthwhile, and while the combat is a tad simplistic, the exploration aspect and the gorgeous art assets make this game worth several hours of play through.			"

												I'm unfamiliar with beat 'em up games like Arkham Asylum is famous for, but I love the combat in this. It's quick, mashy, and short enough you don't get tired of it. Yet you MUST remain focused lest you make too many mistakes. Mistakes that might not kill you THIS combat, but next card might be an unavoidable trap that kills you...And that's really where the appeal lies for me. The feel of a deck building game, all the mystery, your choices mattering, and the thrill of RNG gods dropping that PERFECT item you need.The DLC is fantastic as well. They really nailed the questing aspect with each set of cards, not to mention choose your own difficulty with all character modes. Love this game!			"

I love games that I can play at my own pace and this is one, as well the stories behind each boss are old school rpg and get you imagining them as if they were a much larger story.Everything from the clothing he wears, to the table, table cloth, bowl that he tosses your token's into as well as the room he is sitting in add to the feeling of just you and him at this table playing this game.I am very happy with it and look forward to diving deeper into it so unlock more secrets, achieves and story.

												A deck-based RPG with and much less randomness than it might seem. While the enigmatic Dealer will throw a few wild cards (pun fully intended) at you, your own deck gives you significant control over how a run turns out, and the pick-a-card minigame actually physically shuffles the cards, allowing a sharp eye to guarantee success. Combat is a fairly basic Arkham-esque system, mostly kept interesting through a variety of magical items and abilities, but the real draw of the game is exploring the encounters, and the extremely well-imagined atmosphere of it all. Heartily recommended, even with the sequel in the near future.			"

The more you play, the more variables are added to your adventures in the form of additional cards dealt by the enigmatic figure opposite you at the table. When you encounter enemies, the game becomes a third person hack and slasher with combat thats one part Fable and one part Arkham Asylum. There's no leveling, so character progression is based solely on equipment acquisition, as well as  your own personal aptitude for the combat system.For those interested in scores, I'd give this about an 8/10.I've never played a game presicely like this before, and that's a good thing.

												Verdict: Surprisingly addictive game with a charismatic antagonist and charming (though sometimes frustrating) mechanicsTo be blunt, this game is not what I expected. Then again, what was there to expect from a game that advertises with being a ""card game"" with action game mechanics. When I first saw it, I figured it had to be something like ""Persona"" series of games, and to SOME extent, this holds true. The random nature of each ""dungeon"" is what you might say these have in common. The similarities end, however, when you actually play the game. If I had to compare it with something people already knew, I'd say it is a weird hybrid between a ""Make your own adventure"" game, mixed with a collectible (sort of) trading card game, some D&D and a pinch of Arkham Asylum - if that makes any sense.The gist of the game is this: You are a nameless Adventurer that battles against a mystic card dealer that sets you up with a different dungeon every time you start a new mission. Your adventurer is actually represented by a small golden gaming piece that you can move about the track of cards layed out before you. The cards obviously face down, and the moment you step on it, it is turned to reveal your fate - and behold there is quite alot to be revealed. The scenes are described using text in a the fashion you'd see a dungeon master read from them in any kind of fantasy rpg. ""Action"" in these scenes is usually resolved by being presented some choices and depending on which one is picked, some event happens. An example would be the ""Angry Guildmaster"": He bullies you out of the way with his horse, and you have the option to either ""Humbly apologize"", or try and steal from him. While the first option lets you continue on your way, the second lets you pick 1 of 4 cards to see how things develope. Dragin a ""success"" card will net you a reward card (coming in the form of food, gold, health potions and such), whereas a failure might result in you getting thrown into a dungeon, having to fight your way out against a number of opponents, which - you guessed it - is determined by the pick of a card.You'd be surprised how littel ""action"" there is actually going on. Only a minority of cards (still plentiful, mind you) actually leads to you being set into an action scene to fight. The game has a few set areas or stages where combat might take place, depending on where the descriptive card you landed on told you you were. There is quite a bunch of them, and some of them are trap-ridden and require keen awareness and movement.The combat itself is basically Arkham Asylum's Reflex system, where you have three different actions. Attack, counter, shieldbash. It is, literally, the same thing, but it works quite well and you rarely get the feeling you are not in control. It is nothing new or astonishing, but have you ever heard someone complain about AA's combat system? Me neither.As for items and such, you get a pretty standard array of axes, hammers and swords, a couple of rings, shields and armours, a bit of magic through ""artifacts"", pretty much standard fantasy stuff. Again, it works well enough to keep you entertained and allow for some meta-gaming.Now, you might wonder, what is my goal in this game and how does this card thing come into play appart from being a random mechanic? The longer you play, the more cards you unlock through ""tokens"", which are attached to some cards. Resolve the card in the intended way successfully, and you get new cards. You can then use these cards to build your decks: One is for all your own goodies like weapons and armour, the other for possible encounters - that's right, you get to determine what encounters you might have in your adventure! But beware, the sinister card dealer has a word in this, too. With every new adventure, he puts in increasingly more challenging cards. Also, each of the story mission comes with some kind of ""mutation"": Sometimes everyone moves faster and receives double damage, another one might forbid certain actions, make things more expensive, etc. It will keep things fresh for quite a while, at least for the ""story mode"", which is, essentially, just you wandering from card to card until you reach the next boss. When story mode is not enough, you can always try endless, where anything goes and you continue until you are dead.Now, with the card game mechanics come some things you'd might expect that make the whole experience a little... tainted. Especially in the later stages of the game, you might simply be unlucky and die without being able to do much about it. I had an especially annoying series of events that left me with ONE max HP (that is right: My maximum HP have been reduced from 100 to 1!), no food left (you lose Hitpoint when moving your piece without having food from ""starvation) and nothing to redeem myself. In essence, the game just laughed at me. Now, these extreme cases seem to be very, very rare, but there are other cases where you realize you will probably not stand a chance against the upcomming boss because you simply had no chance of drawing equipment cards, never receiving gold or food, or the dealer drawing two old bosses (once bosses are beaten, they can be drawn as ""regular"" enemies in encounters) very early in the game, causing you to either die or losing many hitpoints. Also, while it caters to the games charm, it is not always clear what the developers intended with certain events and what a certain choice might lead to. This ""trial and error"" principle is probably there to pad out the game a little bit (which would fall a little short in content, otherwise), but be aware that this game sometimes just doesn't seem to ""play it fair"".I also find it a little disappointing that the action sequences are so limited and that the majority of the game takes place ""at the table"". The game does make up with SUPERB voice acting by Anthony Skordi, whom you might recall from voicing the more cockney'esque Dark Elves in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. He also has quite the number of lines to boot, but still, it would have been much nicer if there had been a smoother transition between the card play and the actual action.Also, the overall card and deckbuilding mechanics fall short once you have unlocked all the cards. There is no ways to get ""doubles"" (apart from what the game gives you), or winning ""boosters"" to alter up or otherwhise improve your deck. The developers have already released one DLC, but need to bring more options if they want to bring longevity to this game. Of course, you have to consider that this is a kickstarter game and much of what I critisized could never be expected from the limited scope of ressourced the developers had at their disposal. The game is also budget-priced, so again, the equation fits. It is hard to do this game justice and it is a shame they do not provide a demo. It was a blind pick for me and I was pleasantly surprised, but it is hard to say whether this game will be to your liking or not. It is a fresh idea where the result is greater than the sum of its parts.			"

												Fun game with a high replay value, but the final boss is really really hard to beat, and i mean it.The difficulty of this game at the last boss is insane hard, even if you have the perfect equipment.If you are a fan of D&D style of games and you like challenges , this one is a a great choice for that matter, with cards and a battle system that reminds a lot of Batman/Assassin's Creed games.More cards would make it  an even greater experience, though it has quite a nice amount i'd love to see more variables and have more options to play with.Appart from that, i enjoyed it a lot. It's definitely worth to check it out for yourselves.8/10 "

												I've only played a few hours, so I'll update this review again when/if I finish the game. + The drafting format appeals to fans of CCGs such as MtG and Hearthstone, but applies the draft in a totally new way. + The lack of any notable 'HUD' is refreshing, and makes it enjoyable and easy to pick up. + It's well structured and suits short play sessions. + It is mostly turn-based, making it a great game to enjoy you are doing other things. - Combat seems almost too easy and the default mode present little challenge. - Interesting concepts and unique gameplay, but it can feel a bit repetitive.

												It's hard to sum in in just a few sentences.On the surface it is fairly simple. The game consists of about a dozen missions (each with a different boss encounter at the end, each taking about 10-30 minutes). You have a deck of cards that represent the items you might find during each mission and another deck that represents the encounters you might come across during the mission. The encounter cards also form the 'dungeon' in that they are placed face down in a pattern and you need to walk over them to activate them.At first you only have a few basic items and a few encounters, but each time you 'beat' an encounter card, you get new cards, either new items, new encounters or both. This happens even if you don't beat the boss at the end. Thus even an unsuccessful mission rewards you with more gear for the next time you play the mission.The neat thing is that you choose the set of encounters in the deck yourself, meaning you can stack the deck towards a certain type of encounter.The other thing is that the encounter unlocks themselves tell a story, for example there is one encounter chain where you first come across to lovers who want to run away together, you will later unlock further encounters that tell you what happened to them afterwards. This unlocking of quests gives you another progression axis, so instead of just running the missions and progressing that way by beating the bosses you also progress on this encounter-unlocking axis which makes failure much less frustrating and runs much less repetitive than it would otherwise have been.The narrator is absolutely awesome and really pulls you in to the game.The combat is ok, it's a low prodction values version of the Arkham system. I see some people complain about it not being that great, but it is perfectly functional. The combat sections generally are quite short, and for that the way it works is fine. I have not had any complaints.			"

												A card game in which you build decks of equipment and encounters, playing against a smart-mouthed dealer who guides you from event to event, encouter to encounter, and taunts you every step of the way, goading you on until he either gloats at your failure or grumbles at your success.That sounded pretty darn good to me, so I got Hand of Fate and played it. And I wasn't disappointed.Hand of Fate is a fairly simple game, combining a very Batman Arkham-esque combat system with an overworld card game full of decisions and chances to both succeed and fail. The random nature of the game can put some players off, though, as in the later levels you can play a near -perfect game and still fail miserably due to poor luck. Choosing your deck well can help, but it will only get you so far when the game starts doling out the ""-15 max health"" -cards.The game is occasionally a bit crude in it's visuals and animation, the dealer's card handling puts me off every time, but everything still manages to look functional and clear, easy to read and enjoyable once you get into it, and is brought together beautifully by the voice of the dealer.Hand of Fate is an enjoyable experience and well worth it's price tag. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Playtime: 10+ hours (single near-complete playthrough)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 8Audio: 8Story: 9Gameplay: 9Overall: 9			"

												The game is like a "" Choose your own Adventure"" with a mix of Action combat and strategy implemented via cards.Nice change of pace to the typical hack and slash games, adds new play mechanics with cards of chance. The cards also decide Weapons,Armor, encounters, Blessings, curses, and food rations which are needed for next turn healing.Each boss creates different challenges and the paths are always evolving and changing on each attempt or gameplay. Combat has increasing gotten better since this game was in EA, some of the combat motions at times seems a little slow but they have been refined enough to give that smooth combat style once you learn the mechanics of using a weapon, shield, and possibly Relic card to assist you in battle and how to respond to the different alerts that popup when an enemy is attacking.One of the more enjoyable pieces of the game is the card deck setup that occurs before you take a run at each boss, you get to decide what type of weapons and armor, plus what types of encounter cards are added each time before you start. This helps to somewhat personalize the game play, even though the Dealer has his own set of chance cards that also appear during the game.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys card strategy games...

												Just because your game has familiar and playable parts doesn't mean you can't combine them in unique ways. Hand of Fate shows as the standout example, taking influence from collectable card games, roguelikes, choose-your-own-adventure novels, and modernized brawler combat to portray something more than the some of its parts.The conceit is that you're in an endless game with the mysterious dealer, progressing through increasingly dangerous paths through the medium of shuffled cards. You can change these cards before a game to try and give yourself an advantage, or futher discovery by putting in a potentially trecherous encounter for yourself. Just as you can stack the deck, though, the Dealer will stack the deck against you more and more to counter that.Adventuring through the lands, you can buy equipment drawn from the shuffled-in deck to try and improve yourself, or perhaps grab a blessing to get a futher edge onwards. But you have food to worry about as you explore, keep your supplies fresh or pain and death await.Challenges tend to come in either a choose-your-own-adventure roleplaying format or a combat/dungeon exploration format. The choose-your-own-adventure ones go through a mini story, often with chance elements that are hard to win. But maybe that's not so much a worry when you're encountering them in the future for as long as you have them in the deck. The combat itself is very familiar if you've played any of the Batman Arkham games or even Dark Souls, as it has the mix of different attacks and additional timed counters to spice up the flow - often focusing on mobs of enemies at once.There's a sense of style that keeps things held together, whether it be the hammy game master you're playing against, or the mini-stories the adventure challenges give whenever you encounter them. Matter of fact, the chained quest lines in this game added in over time have really made a difference.I really only have minor niggles with the game, if mainly to do with there being too much reliance on chance or the food survival mechanic being overbearing, but that's really it,If you're looking for something different that's still extremly approachable and will give you hours of fun while you're at it, look no further. Can't wait for the sequel.			"

												I've received this game from friend.I recommend this game when on sale.At the beginning I ware truly astonished by the game. I really enjoyed animations and deck building. Cards collecting is the strongest aspect of this game. Also high replay value thanks to random picked cards, and the bonus endless mode next to story mode is something worth mentioning as well. Many items have special features. Unfortunately after hours of hours playing I've found some disadvantages as well. Your character is not improving in any way, all straights come from equipment and cards (for example maximum health boosts), and the combat is always placed on ""isometric arena"". No place to hide, no place for any complex strategy, and the enemies many times got you from not visible on screen parts of arena, camera should be better, locations should be larger. Anyway I haven't met such game until now, so even with flaws I can recommend it at discounted price.			"

												First and foremost I absolutely love this game for so many reasons. I can sometimes steer clear of card game video games because they can be very lackluster for me. So at first I was hesitant in getting this game. However that was until I watched a gameplay video on Youtube of this game. I then realized how wrong I was and what I was missing out. I was missing out on such a unique take on card games. This has little to do with strategy like most card games but is more about choosing your own adventure. Each game in the story mode takes about 20 or so minutes to go through so it's very easy to manage your time with this game. I've seen people complain about RNG in this game however it's honestly not that big of a deal. RNG only happens with card draws, room layouts, and success chances on certain encounters. The combat is a feature that I really like about this game. The combat is hack and slash, dodge and counter type of combat which I think is really smart to put into a card game because it deter from the possible monotony that a lot of card games have. Every game is different and it has high replayability because of it and Endless Mode which is where you can try and go in a game for as long as you can until you die. A very good gem of a game that I regret not partaking in the Early Access stage of it's life. 10/10 will always play again.			"

												Absolutely solid indie rpg for the price. Tabletop RPG fans will feel at home. The mystical theme works well, and the ""Dealer"" is executed elegantly with his dark wit, personality, voice acting, and nuanced gestures. The gameplay consists of a set of cards dealt faced down on the table in a random path. These represent the ""level"". A figurine represents you on these cards, and you move across them in a direction of your choice, one card at a time, revealing them and resolving them as you land on them. They might be fights, traps, or story events, or some combination of the three. While doing this, you are balancing how much food you have left (it is lost every move), whether your gold is better spent on food, blessings, or equipment, whether it's worth it to explore further or look for a shop on the next level, etc. You are also engaged thematically with the style of the scene, and the banter of the Dealer, while making story decisions for the cards, or engaging in combat.Fights bring you into real-time combat using the gear your have found, in a freeform twitch / reaction combat style similar to the batman arkham series or Middle Earth: Shadows of Mordor. It is not perfect; the camera is a little rough and the animation and targeting can be slightly shaky, but it is still very good, especially for an indie game. I grew comfortable with it pretty quickly, and I haven't had any significant issues. I enjoy it, and I think it's the best form of combat for this game.One of the cards on the level is an exit to the next level, which will clear the table and draw a new map of cards. Depending on the mode of play, you are either descending to ultimately fight one of an impressive number of bosses (story mode), or descending indefinitely into ever-increasing difficulty (endless mode). Endless mode uses all cards that you have found. Story mode uses custom decks that you build ahead of time.The customization and collection aspect of this game really make it shine:As you play, you unlock cards that are added to your collection. You use this collection before each game to build 2 customized decks: Equipment, and encounters. Your equipment deck isn't what you start with, but instead represents all the items that you may find in shops, chests, and as combat rewards throughout the game. Your encounter deck represents the cards that make up a level. So you are putting together the pieces of your story. You are deciding what you'll run into, and what you'll find, with some other things added by the dealer. You unlock new cards to add to your collection as you go.From a developer perspective, these guys put a lot of care into this game. There are elements of conditional dialog, animations, and menus; things like the dealer saying something different or being aware of your stats, things like a menu screen that changes based on whether or not you've completed the tutorial level, and other things that may seem trivial, but took consideration, time, and effort to include, when really they didn't have to. Bigger games have been released with far less intelligent scripting. This has quickly become a personal favorite. "

The action sequence are satisfying to play, and the randomness mean no run will ever be the same. The unlocking process is also very addictive :DReally enjoying it so far! Fair warning though : it IS a rogue-like. Stuff will go bad, and you WILL die. Keep at it!			"

												A great combination of a card game and a (sort of) RPG. Every game you begin with a basic equipement (that gets better every story tier, just like monsters) and from the deck of cards (of which some you choose and some are picked by the dealer - so more or less at random) then determine how the game plays out. Almost too easy at first and almost too unforgiving and unfair by the end, this game of pure luck and some figkting skills in an arena-like encounters is (almost) too fun.Moment of surprise is something this game is build upon, so I will say no more. But I feel a simple disclaimer is needed: this game is not build for long gaming sessions, but ideal for shorter ones. Or if you feel like playing something in between a long one.			"

												In most RPGs, card games are a staple mini-game where you can use the cards collected in random encounters. Sometimes, these games are fun like tetra master in FFIX, but most of the time they are just a distraction and play-time-extenders.With this game, however, it's the other way around. Collecting and playing cards is the main part, while the hack-and-slay-style encounters and bosses are fun, but do not compare to the excitement of unlocking new cards and the adventures and mysteries they hold. It all comes together when a round ends: Regardless of the outcome, each token acquired in the game unlocks new cards that have effects that are yet unknown - you have to uncover their meaning in-game. Then, the dealer invites you to play another game. He let's all your cards hover in a cloud above the table and you just have to click to start another round to get to know your new acquisitions...Highly recommended, especially for players that cannot resist an innovative rogue-like or card-game with many collectibles.

												This game is pleasantly surprising. You are not trying to build an RPG character who can survive hordes of enemies. You are trying to arrange fate to favor one warrior's quest... and since the damage carries from one encounter to the next, you really feel every outcome and blow.And you can decide you don't like a specific encounter. Effing goblins took my good sword! Although, I did beat some food out of them when I was out. But there's often trade-offs.It's a rogue-like where I feel like I have a chance. When I fail, I can usually point to a choice I'd rather I'd made differently... or five or ten blows in combat I wish I'd dodged. It doesn't feel like solitaire, where you can't win a lot of hands. I mean, it is a solitaire, and I do lose a LOT. But even if I just manage to unlock a few more cards, I've gotten some new twists to explore. And it is exploration... you don't get to know what a card does until it's been in play.[Post-EA followup]Finally managed to beat the end boss! :D There's a big difficulty spike in the last 4 levels, and the end boss includes a full boss rush. It took a few tries to get the deck adjusted for a decent shot at victory. A lot of late-game cards will take a few attempts to unlock and may ruin your chances at the current run. Not sure that's such a bad thing. It's a matter of priority... and luck.Still have a couple cards to unlock. It's like being at the end of a nice RPG but there's a sidequest or two remaining.			"

												This is a unique game with great presentation.  Do you like card games?, do you RPGs?, do you like 3rd person action games.  If so, this game is definitely for you.  BUT it is waaaaay easier to play with a gamepad, I play with a wired xbox controller.  The keyboard is too clumsy to really enjoy playing this game.  The best part of the game is the card dealer, the voice acting and the ambience make this game.  You need to understand that I am cheap...I am a frugal bast*rd and I think $20 is worth it for this game.  I am the guy that only buys games on sale in the sub $5 and I can honestly say that this game is worth the price.Once you play you are looking forward to seeing what new cards are going to be thrown your way.  You ask yourself if you want to get more food, gold, or health?  What new monsters will I see in the next phase of the game.			"

												I have only played Hand of Fate for a few hours but it has made a great impression.  It brings back the old pen and pencil D&D memories and it is brilliant fun.  its simple to grasp and so far hasnt been diifficult to progress, however it is hinting at more complicated gameplay and decisions to be made later down the line which i am looking forward to, such as as having enough food to explore the dungeon/scenario versus just try and find the exit.  I really like the change in gameplay between making slower decisions and taking a random pot luck (dice roll) on choosing a card, to using skill in faster paced combat.  the combat, is so far, a somewhat simplified batman/shadow of mordor type where the character can block and counter attack (equipment dependant) as well as using special cards that have been chosen. It isnt without issues, the intro video has some textural issues and after using the steam overlay in game i ended up with a letter box display, however none of the issues have been for me game breaking.   The actual gameplay however has been bug free so far.			"

												I have played a few hours of this game....does not make me an expert but it is the sort of game that you get the feel of very quickly. First, the collect and upgrade aspect is a lot of funSecond, the combat is fun enough to keep you interested. Think the Batman games but not as in depth.Third, the voice acting is so perfect for this game. Fits the mood and sets the atmosphere so well.Fourth, The game play for the ""dungeon crawling"" part of the game is simple but very effective.Fith, the fact that some of the dungeon encounter card get to have different outcomes makes the game very replayable.I have enjoyed this game in the 3 hours I have played it and I intend to keep playing it for a while to come. I would hope that in the future Defiant will add more classes to play with and maybe more objective sets to play with.Thanks for making such a fun game.			"

												Interesting mix on a card-based roguelike and a 3D action brawler (reminds me of Shadows of Mordor).  It works surprisingly well.  As far as ""roguelikes"" go, it's fairly easy -- it's not nearly as brutal as some of the other games more true to the roguelike formula.  For me, this is good -- I can play for an hour or so and feel like I made some progress through the story mode.Perhaps the most engaging aspect for me is the progression.  Beating bosses and quests (represented as cards) unlocks even more cards, weapons, quests, and bosses.  It's always exciting to see a quest for the first time, because beating it usually unlocks another one.  Since quests unlock other quests, often in a logical order, the result is a sort of mini-narrative as you complete quest lines through different playthroughs.  Even more interesting, quests can also influence other quests -- for instance, after completing quests and obtaining a rare artifact, a quest I'd previously seen in a previous playthrough had a totally different outcome.  There are some great dealer voiceovers as well, and it's interesting to see how he reacts to your choices/quest combinations.  It's this sense of progression that keeps me coming back for more.I expect to get about 6-8 hours to complete the Story mode, probably more to unlock all the cards.  From there, there's also endless mode, which has a competitive aspect to it.All-in-all, awesome game, highly recommend.			"

												I haven't seen a game quite like this before(95% luck 5% skill lol). I won't reveal too much in this review. I want people to discover things on their own! This game is really good!Combat is quick, intuitive and a little clunky. (combat is similar to Fable, especially how enemies die lol). The card system is unique and fun. You never know how things will play out. (Protip: Play The Game on HARD difficulty, don't bother with normal... you want to experience this game to its fullest)The fate/luck element is frustrating(and sometimes brutally so), yet when you succeed it's fulfilling (if you're lucky). I keep going back for more, don't get discouraged!Also... I think the card-dealer-master-dude is voiced by Jeremy Irons?!?!?!??! YES?!

												This game i found by facevook post announcing the release. And i regret not beeing one ofe the ""earl access"" people. this game ydevelop out of my sight , might be iam the hardcore linux user out there, or something else, i cant fint a realy fine excuse why i don't stumple early upon that game. Maybe its my steam history. But to get things short, I'am a really really fan of roquelike.Iam playing Nethack for several decades, attending its trouneys out the year.So I'm roguelik nerd. Enyoing everiy ascii game out there. But times has changed roguelike are back in major game development. And i think this game hits hit by much. At first yout think it's ""boring card game with some 3d battle"" Game. But i change as progress in the game. For shure some elemetns repeat in the game, but only as long as you keep the corresponding card in you deck. Which is a litte tight at the amount of cards avaible in the game, which is anosther problem of the game which is you pay a truly decent amount of the game and you will maybe get new cards only by buying the ""DLC"" ... If you have to make a game better by selling a DLC you acctually lost in game design. Which is really the major problem this really good game has. T his game is a truly ""card builder"" game. It takes you to veriy serious challenges. But is it a roguelike?To be serious its not the final answer on ""roguelike""  BUIT it as truly EPIC ""deck builder"" And a shurly ""GET IT!"" recoomandation.Now what about us roguelike nerds? Ok get thet game for some ""Time-Off"" in between training for the next nethack tournament. ;-D To Nethacker(and its decendants  out there: We still need to wait form someone really worthy)  "

												After having beaten the entire game (and having gotten to about level 40 in endless mode), I figure I should give my opinion about the game. In my opinion, this game is fantastic. Not flawless, sure, but definitely worth the price of admission.The Good:No two playthroughs are the same -  You are able to select what cards are in your deck (with the exception of endless mode, where every card is included), but not every card is drawn, and the path of the cards changes in each section. This changes the game's story in a dynamic fashion.Success/Failure Screen - One of the game's most charming mechanics. Your every decision is faced with these cards, and those wary enough can track the wearabouts of each success and failure. Granted, that never seems to help me (usually I get the huge failure cards when I try), but you can succeed on (almost) every decision if your vision is clear.The writing -                          ""gets the Mister Lionel card""                         Lionel gives me a shield.                         The dealer:                         ""I'm beginning to think you put that card in here just for a free shield.""                         0_0Anyway, the writing is fantastic. I love the dealer's sarcastic and mocking inflection, and I love the fact that the game doesn't mind mocking you when you start to cheese the mechanics. For example if you find the maiden too often, and you can be sure that you'll be mocked for your inability to go without her.The atmosphere - If nothing else, the game is just charming in its presentation. Everything from the dealer's shuffling of the cards to the memorable encounters screams theme and suspense. Definitely one to pick up if you're looking for a unique atmosphere.The bad -                  No camera controls. The game does a pretty decent job of tracking your movement, but being able to move the camera would definitely improve your awareness during combat. USE THE TABS, DYNASTY WARRIORS STYLE!                 No customizeable main character. This one doesn't really bother me, since it's an indie title and all, but the only way you can customize your character is through equipment you get in game. Personally, I think this would be much more tolerable if you could switch between male and female avatars. Perhaps somewhere down the road as additional content?                 No ""main story."" - The game has a sort of Dark Souls feel going on, in that you can learn about the world through the cards and equipment you gain. However, it's more about building your own story using the cards as a framework. I know, however, that this will put some people off.                The bugs - Yes, there are bugs on launch. I haven't encountered anything game breaking - instead, it's just been a few irritating ones (like the sfx being switched off after death). I expect these will get patched soon, but I had to include them.The okay:                The combat - The combat is done Arkham style, with dodges, counters, and stuns. One of my favorite parts is that you become unable to do certain things if you lose equipment. Lose your shield? You lose the ability to reflect projectiles and enemies stop displaying their ""attack icon"" indicating that you should dodge. However, the combat itself is both slower and less flexible than Arkham. It's one of the game's weaker points, but it is serviceable.                The slowdown effect - This one can be both good and bad, depending on your opinion. Personally, it gives me more time to take in my situation, but it does noticeably slow down the game's pace.                 The RNG - You will be screwed over, both randomly and consistantly. Sometimes you simply won't find what you need, and you'll die. A lot. However, this is kind of a basic element of the rogue-like genre, so this depends on your tolerance, I suppose.Overall, I believe that the game is worth every penny. The developers (Defiant Devs) listen to the community and are willing to change elements that simply don't work. Even more amazingly, the developer ACTUALLY USED EARLY ACCESS LIKE IT SHOULD BE USED. No cash shops, no broken promises, no controversy. They even rewarded their early access users by giving them the first DLC free. Take a note, game developers.

												Wow. Just wow. I've never been a huge fan of rougelikes, but this game does everything right! Nail-biting RPG encounters while at the table, fluid third-person Arkham Asylum-y combat while in the encounter. Kind of imagine Dungeons and Dragons mixed with Tarot cards played by Batman. I speak no hyperbole when I say that (with the exeption of a couple of bugs) this game does everything right! Would HIGHLY recommend to any fan of RPG, Action-Adventure, Hack 'n Slash, or D&D.

Early Access Review
								so. this game has a cool premise, pretty much as advertised. the dealer lays out a dungeon, made from seperate encounters, each represented by a card. these encounters are either just text decisions like ""give peasant half or all of your food"" and you have to guess, being either rewarded or punished afterwards. this card-dungeon is rogue-lite-challenging, meaning you can just starve because of plain bad luck with your draw and event choices. the other encounters, Id say about sixty percent - are the action rpg part of the game. the combat system is the weakest link in the chain still, and every single type of ranged enemy still has the potential to make me ragequit - but itll have you on your toes at least...in my opinion, the dealer animations in between cards are too long and unskippable. a lot of events determine their outcome by having you draw from four cards, say success/success/failure/huge failure. itll then show you these four, flip them, shuffle them TWICE (!), spread them out, pause a split second more just to annoy you further - and THEN you can draw one of the four. which youll do every thirty seconds. similar stuff goes for other animations, say the laying out of the dungeon in the beginning.besides from these problems, and early-access-issues like say, lack of sounds, the game is cool. the mix is a cool idea, and you can build your dungeon event AND equipment decks in between dungeons, that determine what stuff you might face off against, get benefited by, or loot.

								I will usually wait to reveiw a game untill i have played atleast 3 hours, Hand of Fate does not need 2 hours.

I wont try to explain the formular, why? becuase you cant explain it without missing something or not explaining something properly, Its an experiance you just need to try. Heavy and satifying combat inspired by assasins creed and latest Batman games really hold the game together and bind the card turns, its a game that mashes many things together (to great sucess,) in the process, going a way to reminding me of a little known, but execellent, game on the xbox original named ""wrath."" should you know the game im refering too and you enjoyed it, you WILL like this.edit: 8 hours in and it still applies			"

								i dont regret buying this game even a bit. it is worth every penny. despite having a more hefty price tag for an early access game (and for a broke highschoolers budget)it has plenty of content to keep you ocupied. between the lengthy (but not too long) story and an endless mode you should find yourself more than pleased with the purchase. after reading about hand of fate in game informer i was intrigued by the concept of a rouge-like card game with archem/AC fighting. i have played games for long periods of time simply because i enjoyed the concept, even if it wasnt getting fleshed out in exactly the way i hoped, so i knew that i would be purchasing it soon after i had read the article. the real question in my mind was ""will this game live up to its inovative concepts full potential, or will i be disapointed with the direction the developers are taking?"" and in my mind it is living up its potential. the fact that it is an early access game makes it hard to give a definitive answer, but the direction they are going in is wonderful, and there is lots of potential for more content that satisfys and stays through to the inovative foundation layed in the current build.

												This game just takes the cakefor 20-25$ It is such a great game. I highly suggest it. It has a simple concept yet it takes it and runs with it. The game doesn't focus on doing to many things at once it takes it's clear defined goals and does it very well.  The only con I can really pinpoint is the lack of character selection or customization *as far as his physical traits*, though it doesn't detract from the experience at all. For a rogue-like the randomization is also extremely fair, when something fails, or random happens you don't feel like the game is spiting you, or that some crappy bs was just pulled. If you fail a card selection you won't blame the game, if you arent getting the supplies you need, it will because you didn't build your decks right.9/10			"

												My favourite thing about Hand of Fate is the excellent presentation. The dealer's table is colourful but moody; the environments are beautifully expressive; the cards themselves have a pleasing physicality, and I'm excited when I uncover new ones. The game has a ton of character, which is all the more impressive considering that it brings it all across with a few comments from the dealer and careful visual design. Here less really is more.The combat is less exciting. It's a bit simplistic, and although the game mixes things up a bit later, I never thought it got beyond decent. Still, you're here for the exploration and mood, right? The game delivers in spades on its core engagements, and I heartily recommend you give it a shot.			"

This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review as well.A wonderful presentation with nice game mechanics.  I've always struggled a bit with immersion in the past with games that have a dungeon master, but this game was so inviting.  Even now, I feel like going back into the game.  The game has action based combat.  Some may be a bit disappointed that combat isn't turn based, but as someone who usually also prefers turn based games, I feel that the action based combat works in this games favour.  It doesn't make combat drag out and has an appropriate level of combat attrition for the average person.			"

												I've only played this one for a short while but I am so impressed I will give my opinion now. Hand of fate pretty much sums up why I am an avid support of indie developers. Recently there have been some cracking new titles such as Darkest Dungeon and others where they really have come up with some great ideas. Hand of fate is no exception. My hat goes of to  Defiant who have taken some traditional RPG elements and mixed them in with a luck based card system. This really is thinking outside of the box and it works brilliantly. The great thing is that its not just all about the cards. In combat your reactions play a part as well. The two modes story and endless will ensure a different game time after time. The artwork and card descriptions fit the games atmosphere perfectly.PS. This is not a multiplayer or card trading game. Its single player. That said I think if they ever did a sequel with those elements it would add in a very interesting aspect to what is already a superb title. Well done guys.			"

												Disclaimer: I backed Hand of Fate on Kickstarter for a copy of the game upon release.There's no easy way to categorize Hand of Fate. Defiant Development has looked to tabletop RPGs, roguelikes, action RPG video games, and deckbuilding card games for elements to mix into their game and they've tied it all together nicely using a mysterious man who is storyteller, dungeon master, and dealer, oozing a quiet confidence from the other side of the table.It all comes together with great atmosphere and is really engaging. I have no specific recommendations for who might or might not like Hand of Fate. It's so unique that it's hard to say.

												You proceed through a dungeon, where each room is a card that has some kind of encounter on it.  Some encounters are about making choices, some will lead to a fight scene, in which you need to win a combat against mobs.It works well as a dungeon crawl, due to the random element, but it seems to have decent balance.  The encounters comprising the dungeon are made from a combination of cards put in by the dungeon master (an NPC) and your own deck, which you build over time.There is a reasonably strong RPG feel.  Partly this is because some cards progress based on your choices (if you ""win"" during one encounter, the reward is often a new card with a follow-up encounter).			"

												Wow, what a truly wonderful surprise this game turned out to be. I picked it up on a whim without having any real knowledge of the game till it hit the market. It's a procedurally generated set of dungeons (akin to the old 'choose your own adventure' novels from  20+ years ago) based on cards in a deck that you have a hand in designing. You traverse this dungeon using gear from a separate deck that you also have a hand in designing, which is comprised of gear you found throughout your journey exploring previous dungeons. It's really quite genius.The game is surprisingly deep too. During play you'll see the following:-various weapon damage types-various enemy types-mazes-curses-blessings-merchants-buffs-traps-chests-path choices-bosses-magical items-random loot-artifacts-item activation during combatI'm sure theres more I could add, but I'm still not even 2hrs played. You walk across a board comprised of over turned cards from the deck, randomly laid out in a grid. Each step consumes a food resource, so must monitor your food as you travel. You'll run into decisions in  your journey...do you give some of your food away to a weary traveller? or just pass by them. How you respond will affect the outcome of your journey.While I was originally concerned combat during story mode was too simple. The further I got, Not only was I becoming stronger, but so was my enemy.I definitely recommend this game. It's new and refreshing. Well done!			"

Achievement hunting, deck buidling, and 3rd person hack 'n slash; all entertaining elements that have been pieced together snugly and has kept me addictingly entertained for hours.Some issues with camera angles and no camera control, but not enough to take away from the experience.A console controller is recommend for ease of play.

Saturday morning fun.Hand of Fate...Already seems like it has the makings of a classic choose-your-own roguelike adventure, got it through a humble bundle a few months ago, very lucky for me indeed, or perhaps I should just be appreciative of Defiant's articulate and masterful work.The 'game/dungeoun-master' harkens back to classical wizards such as Merlin, G-dalf and the ilk without seeming cliched, in fact, he seems original and fresh; layers of Easternish mysticism are presented before you and his comments on your doings, comings and goings are quite enjoyable to hear. He may tell you that the blessing you just purchased is a bit imba and he's going to bring out the nerf-hammer next time around, the game does not mean it will actually nerf that blessing next time around, it is actually beating the final level per set of cards that will increase the strength of enemies encountered and also improve your starting gear and provisions. This guy is the only person you really interact with during the game, and that makes your adventure seem delightfully personal.In addition to that, the game is played with tokens to unlock more incredibly detailed cards, beautiful arenas, dungeouns, and shop-areas with little merchant wagons, all revolving around improving your character's odds as you move his little gold playing token through card-maps to the boss event for each set of cards. You may come across a random event where you must select from four shuffled cards, and yes, if your eyes are quick enough you can follow the successful cards as they shuffle, no true randomness involved, just have to pay attention to the minute details as the cards slide across eachother. Anywho, guess the correct cards in these events and you might get a new weapon, some gold or earn the card's token which will in turn, after beating the set boss, unlock more cards for you to play with your next time around.Everything comes together with such subtlety that you almost feel like you're experiencing more than you paid for, this title screams triple-A quality throughout every chapter and turn while still coming through as your humble guide leading you through a poignant adventure largely based on fantastical ideas that leave just enough space within their nooks and crannies to be able to be completely alluded to on a personal level for you and your imagination.

												It's kind of difficult to describe this game but the best way I know how to put it is that it's a bit of classic tabletop RPG mixed with a solid Arkham style combat mechanic and throw in a solid deck manager system sort of similar to something like Magic The Gathering. It's immersive and fun to say the least and for the price point you just can't beat it.			"

												Best writing and voicing of an in-game character I can remember over my 30 years of gaming.  That alone gets the game a thumbs up.  Game mechanics, fun level, rpg-elements and deck building that matters is just icing on the cake.			"
