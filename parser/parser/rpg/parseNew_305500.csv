												The Game seemed decent at first and I was enjoying it, but I then hit a progression breaking bug and I was unable to get any feedback from the forums.  There has not been any recent updates nor has the developer spoke on the forums for months.  I would say buyer beware on this one as I am not sure if it will ever be updated again and the forums are pretty dead.  I will say to be fair that up until I hit the bug it was an okay hack and slash ARPG.  That said, I don't think even without the bug that it is worth the $20 asking price.			"

												*Just to add to it, this is ofcourse my personal view of the game, it's in no way an official statement, nor a fact, your experience with the game can still vary, take that in mind :-)*I was able to test this game before it even got released and I tested both singleplayer and multiplayer aspects of it. The multiplayer review can be seen on the video and it also covers visual and functional part of the game, it can be found at the bottom of this review :-)Now, I haven’t played the first Trapped Dead, so I can’t really compare, altough I have looked at the reviews both on Steam and by external sites and authors. It did not received very good scores, mainly due to being buggy beyond an acceptable point, and generaly awful gameplay. I was curious if anything of the above has gotten better with the sequel.Now I will say this right from the start, it might be better than the first, but it still seriously lacks. The first one was apparently very buggy, and this trend mildly continues, the bugs were random, but there were many. In singleplayer I had some weird issues with my inventory (items that I had before, dissappearing on death and returning to checkpoint), and in multiplayer we experienced horrible missplacement issues, crashing, invisible zombies and as you could have seen in the video, I get stuck in a warehouse unable to progress at one point. This forced us to play this for the second time and switch hosts.The game did receive a big update after we played it for the multiplayer review and I went in to see if stuff got fixed or what was that update about — I have no clue, since the item problems still happen for me, and I had one game crash happen.Visually it’s “alright”. There are definitely prettier games, but to what it is (isometric “3D” rpg game) I have to say that it’s absolutely enough and the game doesn’t do bad with this,.The UI on the other hand is something absolutely horrible and I hate it. It’s clunky, the game doesn’t pause when you go into inventory/etc. And the whole thing is just really hard to figure out and use, since there’s buttons that totally don’t look like buttons (skill points) and the game is using “apply” in several parts of the UI which makes me totally forget to push it every time, since I’d not expect a feature like that.Speaking of skill points and such, this game is supposed to have RPG features, and I can’t really say I’d be enjoying them. Character progression felt boring, nothing new or innovative, due to the UI complications it’s really hard to give attention to it anyway and the overall game just felt more like an action adventure zombie slasher whith annoying rpg features.Story by it self is like a B-rated movie and you shouldn’t expect a plot worth your brain cells,. Literally, if you’re going to play this game, just expect nothing, turn your brain off, and go hack&slash some zombies. On the other hand if you do enjoy B-Rated movies, it might appeal to you a lot.The good part of the story is the voice acting, which is funny and adds a little humour to the game, altough sometimes I feel like the characters are talking for way too long, thankfully you can skip it. Soundtrack on the other hand is absolutely generic, can’t recall any track to be stuck in my head and I believe it’s 85% just ambience noise.I was starting to be annoyed roughly two hours into the game, level design felt like it’s intentionally slowing me down, bugs, no great story, just killing zombies all the time, with weapons that go down with durability faster than you blink and a skill system so weird that you’ll end up using bare fists just to not have to go into the inventory all the time. I saw about 3-4 boss fights and.. the store page claims “Diverse enemies and boss..”. That is so not true, the 4 bosses I encountered looked almost the same and acted roughly the same. That is just killing the game as well, and only adding to the annoying repetitiveness, not even talking about the repeating quests and game mechanics (“place explosive here”).I did had some laughs when playing it with my buddy Brandon Dayton, and I think the main selling point of this game is definitely the co-op multiplayer (so the developer better fix the issues lol) and playing this in singleplayer is just plain not worth it.For me this game has almost no replayability, and I will probably not be coming back to it, only if things get better (fixing the god damn UI & bugs would be enough for me to clench my teeth). It would make a good game for an iPad, as I recall having some similar games installed on it, so I could play it in the subway.If you’re a fan of the first one (despite all the bad about it) you’ll probably get this regardless of my review, and that’s ok, after all its just my point of view, but I feel like it doesn’t introduce much new to the series (based on my research), apart from not being tactical but a hack&slash. And with this price tag, I just have to say to everyone else.. don’t buy it. Just don’t. Wait for a sale, or a bundle to include it if you want it, because you’ll regret spending 20 bucks.*According to an official, this game has nothing to do with the first Trapped Dead, only the name...*Pros(+) Cool voice acting(+) Zombies (seriously, this is enough for most people)(+) Co-op campaign for up to 4 players(+) Multi-platform (OS equality ftw), also XBOX ONE and PS4Cons(-) BUGS, sometimes game-breaking bugs, this really shouldn’t be happening..(-) B-Movie story with typical zombie clichés(-) Multiplayer issues, missplacement, latency, etc.(-) Generic RPG features, that more annoy than excite(-) Level design is gonna make you go zig-zag all the time, ehh(-) Whole game feels very REPETITIVE(-) HORRIBLE UI DESIGN(-) PRICEMULTIPLAYER REVIEW

												Blood curdling fear dripping work of rotting terror. A DIABLO, VAN HELSING style hack and slash action rpg in a modern setting with grim ambience of BLOOD and the first POSTAL where death is everywhere. You can choose between several characters who each are really well voice acted. You will be able to level up attributes and skills personalizing your character by putting level up points in these areas. Characters are varied with some being able to use guns while others like the Priest relying on melee and spiritual powers to destroy flesh feasting fiends unleashed upon the world. Music sets the tone perfectly with its dark all enveloping quality as if the world had been transformed into a unending morgue of sorrow and sanity destroying horror. Graphics are gorey and surreal in their unescapable nightmare visuals. Environments look very nice with a comfortable amount of interaction. Your characters are displayed well though you cant zoom in and out. There is a great rag doll inventory system where you can equip weapons and armor which will change the physical appearance of your character ingame. Gameplay has just the right amount of balanced movement and weapons fire where actions take the proper amount of time to do without being too fast or too slow unlike the first game in the series where the combat and movement felt very frustrating and clumsy. Your character can heal up by consuming food and things like holy water. There are also edible items which will give you temporary boost benefits to your skills.  TRAPPED DEAD: LOCKDOWN buy it! Play it! Save your eternal soul before its toooo lateeeee!			"

												Glitchy, undercooked, overpriced mess.Pros:  nice atmosphere & above average voice acting.    Decent Art direction.    Cons:   Lame AI Pathfinding.    Weak unresponsive controls.    NPCs will regularly glitch out, stand totally still & make quests impossible to finish.    Exiting & restarting the game doesn't always fix that problem.    Bad level design.    The Mini map is worthless.      You'll wander around lost while an Infection clock ticks down.    The Escort missions are a nightmare.         All in all, I love Diablo & I'm not yet sick of Zombies.     However, shoddy game design prevents this game from reaching its potential.			"

												TD:L is a very fun arpg/hack'n slash. If you like diablo, torchlight, van helsing, etc... you should like this game, as the actual gameplay is similar to those games. The story revolves around zombies! Tons of loot, can equip different armors and weapons which changes your appearance, level progression is more old school, (you not only have a skill tree but also level up stats), multiple characters to play as, multiple difficulties, and, although nothing mind blowing, a cool story. I applaud the devs for including gamepad support in an iso arpg, which used to be rare for these games to have on pc, so thank you for helping make a m/k arpg a thing of the past.I also really dig the voice acting, it is very good for a budget title. The graphics are what I expected from a game I paid less than $20 for. If you like iso arpgs you cannot go wrong with Trapped Dead: Lockdown. I highly recommend people that like the genre to buy this game...NOW! Its a steal at its current price. Just don't go in thinking a budget title is going to be diablo 4.			"

It's a trap! - Do not buy this game for Multiplayer/coop purpose!Unless you're no ""retro single player""-lover this game makes false promises. The muliplayer mode is DOWN. For some reasons you cannot reach a single host, nor host by yourself.Devs doesn't respond to fix this issue, apparently because they abandoned this title inofficially but like to suck money from this half-broken remainings.We were eager to see a lively adventure and were deeply disappointed as we figured out, that for some time MP seems to be broken...Ordered a refund, which can be tricky when you bought the 4pack version, because every single player you gifted has to refund on his own. So... you've been warned.At least Valve did add a refund option over the past years...After hosting sinister dev's games has grown in numbers this is just  necessary.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Hack and slash game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can choose between fullscreen mode or windowed mode.There are some resolution sizes.You can only change the controls on the keyboard and not on the controller.The game is NOT KEYBOARD FRIENDLY. Controller is recommended.You are only able to host a game if YOU are in a game. But this will be public however.There is a Music Volume slidebar available.There is a Sound volume slidebar available.There is a voice volume slidebar available.You can toggle the subtitles.Has NO LOCAL CO-OP!About the game.If you are familiar with the combat mechanic from the game ""how to survive"" well it's basically the same. The game is also Top view.  Before you begin you may choose between one of the 5 characters. Each character has their own attribute and strength. You start in the middle of the city, Exploring things and completing quests. You will also kill zombies on the way. The zombies has also an own level (Like dead island) and items has durability. The attributes are a bit weird. There is Melee damage, Melee and weapon, Weapon, Mystic and a bit of everything. I don't really see any huge difference here. If you have died the enemies that you have killed before will remain dead, even if you have respawned. If you leave the game then the enemies will reset back from the last checkpoint. Whenever a zombie is close to death. He might run away for a short while and he will rip off his limb and eat it. He will regain health from his limb.Has quests and some sort of story.Has difficulty settings.Has item durability.Level system,Perk system.Graphics are okish. Bit old.Has a minimap and a tutorial.There is a voice notification when you are close to dead. He will say that he needs to heal.The character look will change if you have equipped an item. (Like a helmet).You can't travel back.Game is not bad and not good. It's casual but repetitive.Subtitles are voiced over.Bosses feels a bit unbalanced.Other things.The trade tramp has almost 100k gold... just wtf.You can hit and kill enemies through a wall with a melee weapon.There is NO pause button.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												Trapped Dead was a game that didn’t receive much acclaim from either gamers or critics. The gameplay was monotonous, the UI clunky, the enemy AI seemed to have trouble pathfinding toward the player, and bugs/crashes were rampant. While the RPG-style leveling, skills, and gear kept hardcore fans of the genre engaged, many people weren’t satisfied with the amount of entertainment offered. There are plenty of games that performed the same functions a lot better. When a second installment was announced, the collective reaction was mostly one of surprise. How could this game possibly merit a second release? Was a lesson taken from poor reception of the original? They did give the sequel to a different developer, so all hope is not lost. Let’s find out as we take a deeper look at Trapped Dead: Lockdown.The graphics and music do work rather well, and are a notable improvement over the last game. I enjoy that the various equipment you find shows up on characters, and that the various character classes are only able to equip certain types of equipment. The skill trees are different between the classes and so the replayability is actually pretty decent. Unfortunately, most characters will follow the same quest line, which mostly consists of the usual go-here or fetch-this. It isn’t really conducive to any sort of lasting engagement and even with your screen spattered with gore, you may find yourself pretty disengaged. The combat is extremely straight-forward and doesn’t really offer anything different than the previous installment. Hopping online and bashing zombies with your buddy is a good time, but could be made a lot more enjoyable if combat and questing was made more engaging.The levels stay varied, which is appreciated. Going from a prison to a swamp to the sewers does make you want to continue and see what’s next. This want is complicated by the clunky UI, which you will need to navigate to find explosives needed to get past certain obstacles. Pressing escape and clicking in equipment/skills simply isn’t sufficient. Implementing a hotkey would go a long way in making this game feel more playable. Bugs and crashes aren’t as prominent as they were in the last game, but they are still there. My recording session was ground to a halt when my friend and I discovered that a certain set of explosives needed to progress deeper into the sewer wasn’t anywhere to be found in our bags. There were latency issues during multiplayer, which is one of the main selling points of this game. If things aren’t cleaned up considerably, I predict this game falling into obscurity like the previous one.Did Trapped Dead deserve a sequel? Maybe. But to me this feels more like something that should have been free DLC. The core mechanics of the game are average at best and have not changed significantly since the last installment. The skills are difficult to assign and makes the skill tree feel a bit arbitrary. The story is engaging, but only because it makes you feel like you are living out a zombie B-movie. Enemy AI seems to be slightly improved, along with less bugs and crashes, but it still isn’t up to par for a game being released in 2015. If you enjoy action-adventure games and/or beat-em-ups you should give this game a shot, but overall I found the experience to be average at best and frustrating at worst. Trapped Dead Lockdown certainly doesn’t live up to the hopes of fans of the original, and people being newly introduced to the series will probably find it far too generic. A nice attempt, but better luck next time.Gameplay:    Controls- 3/10    Fun Factor- 7/10    Difficulty- 5/10    Replayability- 4/10    Innovation- 3/10Aesthetic:    Graphics- 6/10    Music- 5/10    Sound FX- 7/10    Story/Lore- 6/10    Level Design- 5/10Final Score: 51/100 for graphics, voice-acting, and fun factor.Summary: Zombie RPG beat-em-up, complete with currency, loot, and skill system.Full text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-trapped-dead-lockdown/Full review video:

												I rarely leave a review but felt this game deserving of one. I collect games and usually just take them out for a quick test drive with the intention of getting back to them if one appears to have potential. Of the three games I bought today Trapped Dead: Lockdown was the one I held out the least amount of hope for. Much to my surprise this little game was a blast and I was blown away by it enough to go back in my libraray and break out the original Trapped Dead and start it up  to. Trust me this will be $9.99 that is well spent.			"

												I've been playing and somewhat enjoying this Diablo-esque type action RPG (which I admit to having a weakness for) for some hours now and finally did finish it. It grew a bit repetitive towards the end and the voice acting was on the cheesy side at times, but overall I had a decent time playing it. It looked ok, no glitches or bugs that I saw (though reading online I was one of the lucky ones in this regard) and it had enough loot to keep me playing. Good for brainless entertainment.			"

												I recommend it only if you get it on sale, and you like the graphic style, and you have a Xbox 360 controller that works on your PC.It was satisfying wandering around killing things and exploring, and I liked the game up until the driving levels. There's lots of unfair and unbalanced parts, but they give you a checkpoint right before so it's not that bad.The keyboard + mouse controls are really bad though, you use the number keys to drink health potions and do 1 of 2 special moves, and your mouse is used to move places and attack. Which made combat really awkward.			"

Posted: May 14, 2015
												[Revised 11 June 2015]  Trapped Dead: Lockdown is a rock-solid, kill-the-zombies game that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The dialogue, scenery, and characters are all cartoonish without being cartoony.  The combat is fun, franetic, and delightfully gory, yet  requires some tactical considerations, not simple button mashing. I can't tell you if you'll like it, but I can tell you that the very first time I played it, i played it for 3 hours straight.  Some reviewers have said they don't like the art, but i think the simple style of the art lends a brutish and savage aesthetic and works here.  It's not bad art. It's merely a simplified style and, I believe, it adds to the game's tone and vision.Today Trapped Dead lock-down patched the broken controller issue.  They have thus responded to complaints, owned their mistake, and repaired it.  For that reason I have changed my recommendation to the thumbs up I would originally have awarded the game. I remain concerned about the unresponsiveness of the developer, a concern that originally garnered a thumbs down review from me.  True they have just today patched the problem with the controller, but the parties involved remain mute here at Steam.  They haven't even announced the game has been patched or what the patch repaired.  If I hadn't actually seen the game being updated when I signed in today, I would have gone one believing the game was broken.  As it stands it's anybody's guess whether other issues complained about in the forums have been fixed at all.In my original review I wrote that ""The silence displayed by the development group and the publisher hint at best a disregard for the player's experience.""   It's since occured to me that they may simply be inept or inexpert at communitcating with their customers and would-be customers.  Whatever the reason, silence is a poor practice in a community as vocal as Steam's.  If you have problems, after complaining on the forums, then let me recommend you do as I did and contact their support team directly.  Like me you may get an e-mail saying that the developers have been informed.  Hopefully, unlike me, you'll get a confirmation once the fix is in place too.			"

												First Impressions:A fairly typical action RPG that features five different classes, items with durability that need repaired via cash, quests, and etc.  I'm all for zombie action RPGs, though the voice acting can be a bit much/out there at times.  I also don't like the inventory system, requiring you to click on a slot and then choose from the available items (similar to Diablo III for the Xbox 360).  I really haven't seen anything yet that revolutionizes the genre, but it's not bad for what it is.  Not great, but not bad either.  Things tend to get repetitive, based on what I've played thus far.  I personally would wait for a sale (or buy the 4 pack if you have friends as it is a buy 2 get 2 kinda deal).  While some might enjoy this title, I'm going to give it a no-go until I see a price drop or at least something in-game that I haven't already seen before.

												Bought the game on the humblebundle site for only 1.99. For that price it is okay. I have to mention though that I've been playing games with similar graphics 20 years ago on my Amiga 500. There's like 6 classes, the description says that  alone 3 of them were good at both, melee and using guns. So I don't know why there's so many classes. At the vendor however you can purchase guns that are just crossed out. So your character can't use them. What it does not show, which class you have to play to use eg. the Katana. The menu for the equipment and the statpoints is ugly. I tried to connect to multiplayer games several times with no success. It is not possible to join a multiplayergame or host one so somebody could join you.Although it is stated in the game description. Seems to be some bug. For the price of 20 Euro I can not recommend this game. That is totally overpriced. There's many free 2 play games that do a lot of stuff better. Or old games that are available for free nowadays.  If I had payed 20 I'd really regret it.			"

												The opportunity to play as an exorcist in the middle of the zombie apocalypse, armed with magical-energy-ball firing crucifixes and rosaries, or holy water and bibles, has all the makings of insane fun. So when I fired up Trapped Dead Lockdown, I thought I was in for a ball of a time.The first thing I noticed was the experience system. Instead of an empty bar, you start each level with a full one. The bar represents fear. For each zombie you kill, your fear reduces. When the bar’s empty, you level up. Huh, I thought, the less afraid you are, the more badass you become. Clever.Everything went downhill from there.The full review and score are here, on Nerd Rock from the Sun - http://nerdrockfromthesun.com/game-reviews/trapped-dead-lockdown-review/Note: We were given a review code for the game by the developers.

												A very good game 10/10, controls are dead easy, you can play it with just the mouse... other than the driving around squashing zombies. It's a cross between resident evil and old school GTA. Immersive game, very addictive. You don't lose everything when you die. You can buy and sell stuff, rank up, lots of different zombies. Graphics are decent. Some things are quite challenging, but not to the point of being frustrating. I like this game a lot.			"

												Can´t believe this is a game from 2015. Looks like Diablo 2 .. only worse. Plays worse. Better get D2 or Titan Quest if you want to play a budget Hack´n´Slay and forget about this			"

												TL:DR version:GO READ. I'll not cut my opinions short because of you lazy asses.REVIEW:It's been pretty hard for me to decide how to grade Trapped Dead: Lockdown. By today's gaming standards, game would certainly be thumbs down title. But then again, screw the standards and let's see if I had some fun. Judging by that thumps pointing up, I guess I did.Maybe, just maybe you'll remember Trapped Dead, isometric tactical Commandos-went-George Romero game that was really interesting, but had a plaguing problems concerning bugs and bad camera positioning. I really wanted to play that game, but every single time when I've launched it, I went berserk over camera and getting stuck in the rooms whil trying to sneak my way around numerous zombies.Trapped Down: Lockdown isn't really a sequel per se, but another chapter in Trapped Dead universe. Here we have action hack-n-slash RPG that doesn't really ask of you to be subtle nor gentle... minutes after you're in game, it goes Evil Dead / Braindead on you.You can choose between several classes which don't really differ way too much, but they let you play with their specific weapons and items and define your gameplay style that way. My favourite - butcher. Think Barbarian. Story is horrendous (in a perfect way), missions are linear and if you're an achievement hunter you're gonna have some nice time searching all over the game areas for that one zombie you need to kill to unlock that shiny medal...I do recommend this game, but it's a must for me to be specific about to whom I recommend it to. This is a game for everyone ready to dwelve into late 90's/early 00's hack'n'slash madness, not too sensitive or demanding concerning the richness of gameplay/storytelling. If Trapped Down: Lockdown was released back in that period, it would be hidden and obscure classic (read: something that generation of gamers that are now nearing their 30s played in their high school days and loved it immensely, although they don't know why) - it has every single element of it. Atmosphere is great. Hacking is overwhelming. You get to upgrade your character, pick those sweet fruits of skill tree and create one unstoppable killing machine. Characters you're about to meet are legendary bad (think car salesman Republican that minutes after finding out his daughter died sends you out to get him some appliances so he can make more money. Or a crazy floating witch. Or mad scientists. Or... oh my, there's bunch of them and you'll love to laugh your way through this game). Locations look fairly similar to those from the first Trapped Dead game and if you've played it, you'll feel like gone back home. Bosses are weak points of the game since they're nothing more than upgraded versions of regular zombies, but they shine smokey-blue and you can't deny the satisfaction of murdering them in cold blood.Trapped Dead: Lockdown also offers multiplayer co-op game, but I highly doubt you'll need to play this one with your friends - you'll have five classes to work out with in case you really decide to play again after you beat the game with one of your characters. Linear nature of game missions (go down the street, kill everything that moves, talk to NPC, do his bidding, kill everyone, continue after NPC said mission is complete...) doesn't really help with game replayability. Let's be honest, Trapped Dead: Lockdown looks cheap and feels cheap (those unbelievable 'bloody' fonts are hurting my eyes and are bad design decision). It is also retro enough to remind you of playing silly games like Blood or Flesh Feast (please, can anyone remember Flesh Feast or am I the only one brought up on this horrendous craziness). It's basically one of those weekend games - you get 'em on No-Clue-What-To-Play Saturday and you're done with 'em on Evening-Before-School-or-Work Sunday. But those hours playing, if you're not too demanding can be pretty fun.			"

												In a world full of hack and slash games and zombie games Trapped Dead Lockdown comes running in with the intentions of standing out but instead falls short of everything one would want.The story is just straight up B Horror film wannabe but while having a few laughs doesn’t hold interest and I expect most that play this won’t be doing so for the story. The graphics as well don’t really stand out and often times were muddy and not close to modern standards. Characters often enough talk for way to long forcing you to have to skip over each box of dialog while the games soundtrack continues to drone on throughout the game never being memorable for even a second.What should save the game though is its game play but we already know that it doesn’t. Trapped Dead Lockdown tries to play like your typical hack and slash RPG similar to the Torchlight and Diablos of the world. Instead we get something that tries to do that and instead turns into delayed reactions and being swarmed by guys. When you attempt to attack there is a delay on that and it later in the game turns into a luck based battle on if your attacks will hit. Throw in multiple enemies and you better hope your guy hits them all or that you have health packs.Level designs are another nightmare. Thankfully the mini-map provided is absolutely no help what so ever. Buildings turn into just room after room and everything one tends to look the same, prisons are just long hallways that make little sense. Going outside is just dark textures for long stretches. You’ll often see texture glitches and spaces black out into nothing. I saw NPC’s as well stand still and glitch out making quests they had unobtainable.Even something as simple as the loot and leveling up system I found lackluster. The majority of the loot I found was always close to the same or similar items I had and were always junk. Once I leveled up I never really saw a vast improvement or felt like my character was being the unstoppable killing machines the way that better games of this genre do.Overall I found very little entertainment coming from this game. It could have been a lot better but instead felt like it was underdone in every category and in a genre where there are several games that leagues above this I just can’t recommend this one above others. Score :1/10http://apocalypticdemise.com/2015/03/29/trapped-dead-lockdown-review/ "

												Whilst the original Trapped Dead was a huge disappointment, this (sequel? remake? reimagining?) is made by a different studio. Thoughts of the original game colored my impression of this for quite a while, however about 8 levels in I realised I was really enjoying myself and found it hard to put down. Sure it's got some flaws: the movie compression is ugly, the voice acting is terrible (and I hardly ever think that even when everyone else goes), the storyline is incomplete and meandering and references events and details which were never previously discussed, NPCs are completely unrealistic, but you don't come to this game for the story. The action is fun and that's what counts. Gameplay wise, I don't think I'd play this multiple times to unlock all the achievements with multiple classes, and there's probably too much inventory juggling, but apart from that it's a good blast. Don't expect some wonderful polished experience like Shadowgrounds, this is not that good, but it's not garbage like the first Trapped Dead either. Pick this up on sale and it's a good buy.			"

												A rather fun hack n slash  zombie game all about tearing through hordes of the undead, completing quests and exploring until your reach your final objective. The combat is comparable to ARPG's like Path of Exile or Diablo just not as refined, the skill progression system isn't the most intuitive but it gets the job done. Overall its a decent game that I believe isn't quite worth the twenty dollar price tag, in my opinion if it were cut in half it'd be a more reasonable price for what you get.			"

YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Trapped Dead: Lockdown' 

			Views: 58		

			Massive Thanks to the Dev's for the Review Copy! http://store.steampowered.com/app/305500 I take a quick look @ 'Trapped Dead: Lockdown' - A small American town is overrun by the living dead!		

A small American town is overrun by the living dead! You manage to enter the town just before the military locks it down and now you must slice and shoot your way through thousands of zombies in order complete your mission in this action-packed Hack & Slash RPG. In Trapped Dead: Lockdown, you fight your way through an interactive horror story as one of five different characters: The marine, the butcher, the assassin, the marshal and the exorcist. Every class comes with their own custom storyline, as well as individual strengths and abilities – the assassin is an expert in firearms, the butcher slaughters his enemies in melee combat and the exorcist fries zombies with his spiritual abilities. Each of the characters features his own individual skill tree, where you can unlock new defensive abilities and attacking moves to aid you in combat.			"

												Wow....this was pretty bad.Right from the start , you are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and assaulted with poor UI/UX choices e.g. by way of being randomly buffeted with ""Help dialogs"" that halt the game and spawn in different areas of the screen, with no keyboard shortcut for closing them, requiring that you click on a small 'X' to do so. Pity, this game had some potential and would have been a nice diablo-esque in a modern setting.A work of amateurs no doubt. And uninspired developers maybe.			"

												Trapped Dead: Lockdown and first off is way ahead and much better than it's prequel. That said, decent RPG  very straight forward, hack n' slash isometric Torchlight style but as it's ugly cousin..Lacks more settings options, the inventory sys. is it's worst feature imo.  plain simple almost calling us players all dumbs, short itens capacity, the weapons, itens and clothing gets damage real quick, boss's at the end of each chapter or phase whatever, seem all the same,  the skill set are not brilliant or amazing it's just ""meh"", good amount of missions, different characters to chose from with unique perks/stats each,  driving possible, steam and ingame achievs. In general it can entertain fans of the genre for some hours, therefore  i give it a positive review regardless it's obvious downs. p-s . It has multiplayer although  havent tried it yet.Aqua			"

												this is actually pretty fun if you like rpg's. it's a lot like diablo 2, not much like the first ""trapped dead"" at all.this is an rpg game.CONTROLS: you no longer use the mouse to select your human than select what he's attacking. instead you point and click to where you want to walk/run to, you point and click on the enemy you want to attack. controls are just like diablo.GAME PLAY: kill enemies and level up, find better weapons, armor, etc, use skills/powers to help you through the game, do quests/missions to progress through the game and i believe gain exp to level upGRAPHICS: are good. they are similar to diablo 3perhaps not the best rpg ever but still a good game and far better than diablo 3 imo, then again that game sucked and isn't a good comparison.im not very far in this game yet, but i enjoy it so far. i'm sure you will too.
