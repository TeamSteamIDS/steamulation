												The cult classic sci-fi horror FPS-RPG has returned. System Shock 2 is an interesting game to review in 2014. When it first came out in 1999, it was met with a lot of praise from the gaming press, winning over a dozen awards, including several “Game of the Year” titles, and since then it has appeared on several “Greatest Games of All Time” lists. However despite the praise, not many people actually bought and played it.It feels like System Shock 2 has been granted a second chance though. The success Irrational Games has had with BioShock and BioShock: Infinite has interested people enough to want to check out System Shock 2, which was the first game Irrational created. This is great news, because while you might not expect it, I feel that System Shock 2 is the best of all the “Shock” games. It makes you realize that for all of the steps forward we have taken in terms of technology, in a lot of ways modern gameplay has taken a few steps backwards.System Shock 2 takes place aboard the world’s first Faster Than Light starship the Von Braun as well as the UNN heavy destroyer the Rickenbacker which was tethered to the Von Braun so it could make the FTL jumps as well. You, the player, wake up from Cryo Sleep 5 months after the ship has left earth. It appears that while you were sleeping some force has managed to hijack the ship. You spend much of the game trying to figure out what exactly happened while you were sleeping, getting ship systems back up and running, and coming up with a plan to stay alive. The primary story of the game is told through many audio logs scattered around the ship that were left by the dead crewmembers, as well as visual clues in the levels that shed some light on what has been going on. This was one of the first games to do this, which has only recently started to become popular.Both the Von Braun and Rickenbacker are both pretty large ships, and the game does not have any real “levels” in the traditional sense. The ships are broken up into decks (medical, engineering, hydroponics, operations, etc), and each of those decks are broken up into sectors that are separated by bulkheads which often require keycards to access. You are always free to move back and forward between decks and sectors you have gained access to. The game treats the ships as one large persistent game world. For example, if you come across some heavy armor that you do not have the required strength to equip, you can always come back to it later once you have the required stats. Or if you drop an item in a hallway that you do not have space in your inventory for, you can come back and get it hours later if you feel the need to. In fact, this sort of back tracking is sometimes necessary, as certain areas of the ship are only accessible after you do something in a different area. While the game in linear as far as some areas are locked until you find the keycard or access codes, it often lets you tackle multiple objectives in whatever order you see fit.Speaking of stats like strength, the game has an interesting RPG like system that determines what you can and cannot do. As you complete objectives, you are granted access to “Cybernetic Modules” that you use to upgrade your cybernetic implants. You spend these points at upgrade stations around the ship. There are four main categories of upgrades: stats, psi, weapons, and tech. Stats include things like strength, endurance, and agility. The weapons category contains sub-categories such as standard weapons, heavy weapons, and energy weapons. The tech category is where you find the skills associated with hacking, repairing, and modifying. The Psi category has five separate tiers of power, which need not be learned in order. Each tier includes seven individual powers. These powers compare pretty favorably to the plasmids from Bioshock, and include abilities like Photonic Redirection (turning yourself invisible), Enhanced Motion Sensitivity (shows enemies nearby), and Projected Pyrokinesis (shoots a ball of fire).The game has more gameplay systems then just the skills. Let’s use the weapons as an example. Each weapon as multiple fire modes that have strengths and weaknesses, such as an overload shot for a laser pistol that does more damage but is energy inefficient. On top of this, each weapon can be modified, provided you have the appropriate skill level. Examples of modification include increasing the clip size, increasing the rate of fire and decreasing kickback. Each time you fire a weapon, its condition starts to degrade, and you must use maintenance tools to keep the weapon in working order. If you neglect a weapon long enough, it can actually break. At that point you need to repair the weapon before you can use it again. On top of this, many of the guns have different types of ammo such as armor piercing rounds and anti-personnel rounds. How does one know what type of ammo to use against each enemy? That is where researching comes in.When you kill enemies, they often leave behind organs that you can collect from their bodies. If you have a high enough research level, you can research these organs to learn more about the enemies you are facing. It will tell you what types of weapons they have resistances to, which types of weapons they are extra vulnerable to, and it will also give you a buff to all damage done to them. Researching isn’t limited to enemy organs either. You will often find exotic weapons and items that you cannot use until you have researched what they are. Researching items requires different chemicals as well. Which chemicals are required depends on the item. Each deck of the ship has a chemical storeroom that contains a selection of most (but not all) of the chemicals that you need for research. If you are researching an item that requires a chemical that is not in the storeroom on your current deck, you will need to locate the proper chemical somewhere else.Since System Shock 2 is a survival horror game at its core, you spend a lot of time managing and rationing your supplies. You don’t always want to fight every enemy you come across, otherwise you might find yourself out of ammo. Running from or sneaking by enemies are always valid tactics. You can sometimes take more creative approaches as well, such as hacking a turret and baiting enemies into its firing range. There are also vending machines located throughout the ship, which you can spend money (Nanites) that you collect on items such as ammo and health. Not every vending machine sells everything, and you can hack the vending machines to offer you better prices. Nanites are also the currency used to hack, modify, and repair items, so it is up to you to determine the best way to use your supply of them.All of these layered gameplay systems are what make System Shock 2 stand out as surprisingly modern when compared to current games. Even Bioshock, a critically acclaimed modern game, feels a bit shallow when you compare it to System Shock 2. I would even go as far as to say Bioshock is a watered down version of System Shock 2. This complexity also opens the game up to be played multiple times, and each time you can build your character in drastically different ways. Want to play the game as a stealth character, only killing when absolutely necessary? That’s possible. What to build a melee weapons only character? That’s also possible.The only thing about System Shock 2 that feels dated are the visuals, and even that can be mitigated to some degree with mods. The story is great, the audio design is both haunting and impactful when it needs to be, and the gameplay was so far ahead of its time that even modern games feel shallow in comparison. If you can get over how the game looks, I would absolutely recommend giving this first person survival horror RPG a try. It might just be your 2014 game of the year… from 1999.			"

												System Shock 2 really is one of the best games ever made.  It's one of those games where all the elements mesh together so well that it still manages to be a great game 10+ years after release.  There are graphic mods available which I highly recommend (check the game hub for a guide) though they definitely aren't necessary to enjoy the game.The gameplay is a mesh of FPS and RPG similar to Deus Ex, though gun accuracy does not suffer due to a low skill level.  Many objects are interactible and you will need to utilize mouse interfaces quite often.  One unique thing about the game is that it does not pause when interacting so you need to be aware of your surroundings so you are not attacked while doing so.The game uses the old-school style of giving you objectives without marking exactly where they are so you need to pay attention to where you're going and what you're doing.  The one thing I wish the game had was markers on the map for mission locations once you discover them as it can be difficult to find them again when you need them.There is a good variety of weapons for melee, ranged, and psi combat.  The guns are very accurate unlike Deus Ex, though the recoil can throw off your aim.  Melee combat is definitely a weak spot in the game with the range and hitbox being very short and unclear, as well as the melee attacks being quite slow.  There is an overhead attack upgrade you can get that unfortunately makes these problems worse.Where the game really shines is in the atmosphere, writing, and of course, SHODAN.  Even with the very dated graphics, this game manages to be the creepiest game I have ever played.  I admit I have not yet played Amnesia, but I do believe System Shock 2 could give it a run for its money.  SHODAN is an amazing character, and really adds to that atmosphere as well.About the game difficulty: I've heard many people say the game is too hard.  I didn't have much trouble though I am very experienced with FPS's.  I do know that psi builds are very difficult compared to others.  Total completion time: ~12 hours.Play this game!  You will not regret it.			"

												Four things to know:1. You want this game. This game is great. All-time great.2. You want to install visual mods that really make the game sparkle on modern displays. This mod pack packages up all of the best visual mods in one collection: http://neutralx2.com/2013/07/14/system-shock-2-mod-packThese mods are as faithful to the original look as possible. They just make the game look like it should on today's high resolution displays.3. Load the ""standard FPS"" control preset. It will save you a little remapping.4. Turn off the music. Pounding techno music (like in Med Sci 1) stomps all over the rest of the game's lonely, isolated atmosphere.			"

												The Good:+ A Very haunting atmosphere. The graphics are dated however a few mods can make it better+ The scariest game you will play. + Fantastic sound design + Great RPG mechanics. You can invest in different weapons, abilities, os psi abilities. Essentially you can play the game any way you want to+ Great story and voice actingThe Bad:- Graphics are a bit outdated obviously, mods do a decent job but if you love super amazing graphics, you won't find it here-Some of the objectives have you running back and forth between the same areas. It feels like needless backtracking. - Last few areas of the game are not funOverall: This is a true classic and needs to be played by everyone. It's not perfect but its still one of the best first person RPG's out there. Its almost sad that Bioshock the spiritual successor to this game pales in comparison to certain aspects that this game delivers.			"

												System Shock 2, 1990s gaming's swansong, can boast the honor of having written the book on complex hybrid FPS gameplay, open-ended skill progression, conceptual horror, sound design and environmental storytelling. Now that I think of it, that means it's pretty much written the book on everything in modern-day gaming. Games still emulate it, either directly or indirectly, to this day; and more recently in the 2010s, there's now a strange sort of niche genre around it, which I nickname ""Shocklike"" games (for instance, when Bethesda rebooted Prey 2, they demanded up front that the game be designed as if it were ""System Shock 3""). Even incompetent and ethically bankrupt publishers swear by it; that's got to mean something!Oh, and you ought to play it. Not only does it still hold up remarkably well, but the experience it offers remains unparalleled in its quality, unique in its atmosphere and overall, really freaking great.			"

												Finally i finished this game in 2015 but its well worth it, im writing this review from personal enjoyment and satisfaction.First of all this game is developed by Looking Glass Studios who has also developed game franchises like Ultima Underworld and Thief.Also this game was designed by the almighty Ken Levine and co-developed by Irrational Games.System Shock 2 is a first-person shooting game which incorporates role-playing system elements, also survival horror at its best.The setting of the game is in a starship when an infection begin and devastated the ship,so as a lone survivor you start with the weapon we might say its memorable to Ken Levine games ""the wrench"", so the player has to progress through the ship levels along side of that is the awesome dark atmosphere that keeps you on your toes because enemies are always near you and you cant feel safe.The rpg elements in this game are strong because you have a large inventory and exploring is probably the main thing you have to do to survive in this infected ship, from the class you choose you can have certain benifts in weapons,hacking or psi power.The player can hack turrets,devices,crates,vending machines also skills called ""cyber-modules"" which can upgrade stats,weapon skill,psi powers,abilities and for every item picked there is a description what is used for cause if you are like me you will get confused a lot.The weapons have their own strengths and weaknesses and you will have to repair,maintain and modify them.The plot gets interesting more and more as you pick audio logs through the levels which explains the events that occurred on the ship.Not the mention as you progress through the plot appears one of the best villains of all time SHODAN with the amazing sound it makes the plot interesting to the end.I dont want to go too much on the storyline there's no way to do so without totally spoiling the game.The graphics are outdated but they are acceptable for those who want a good story although there are some mods that would make the models and other things better,the sound overall is amazing and the overall presentation is amazing.System Shock 2 is a masterpiece,unrivaled in many ways it shows quality that will fulfill enjoyment even today.

												System Shock 2 (which doesn't expect you to have played the previous installment) is a survival-horror first-person-shooter with role-playing elements, and is regarded by many as one of the all-time classics -- and deservedly so.The game takes place within the cold metal walls of the FTL-capable spacecraft 'Von Braun', and its piggy-backing sister ship, the 'Richenbacker' -- which, handily, needs a capable grunt to help keep it safe. After a few short (and, thankfully, optional) tutorial VR simulations, you chose one of three 'classes': a gun-wielding Marine, a psi-power controlling Psi-Op (otherwise known as a wizard!), or the middle-of-the-two Navy -- and are then dutifully assigned to the Von Braun on its and humanity's maiden faster-than-light voyage. Put into cyrogenic sleep until needed, you are rudely awakened to find your memory erased and the ship seemingly empty, barring a Doctor Janice Polito who offers you help over your communicator. You quickly find that a force of seemingly alien beings have taken control of the ship and its system-controlling AI (along with a fair amount of the on-board monkey population!), as you and Polito form an alliance to try and regain control of the ship...or at the very least re-enable the needed systems to call for help.The game plot initially focuses on your player-character receiving orders from Pollotio, who's quite handily barricaded in her room on the Operations deck. With a primary objective of attempting to reach her and call for help/escape, she keeps you updated with any objectives that need to be fulfilled to gain access to further areas of the ship and slow down the advance of the enemy where possible. I say 'initially focuses on' as things soon change, and, without spoiling anything, System Shock 2 will spin the story on its head -- and treat you to one of the most wonderfully constructed plot-twists in gaming history (well, it had more of a kick in 1999, anyway). It isn't ground-breaking story-wise, but it's exceptionally executed, and has left an impression on everyone who's ever played it; Ken Levine certainly engrossed right from the beginning.The Von Braun itself is split into several different sections, each deck providing a different function for the on-board science crew, and each providing you a different type of environment to explore; from the cramped and radioactive engineering deck to the more open shopping and recreational deck, each section feels individual -- although all of the decks feel as cold and oppressive as you'd imagine a floating tin-can to be. Make no mistake though, the game is quite linear: objectives rarely span more than one deck, allowing you to constantly pursue and explore new and interesting areas -- however you may wish to back-track across previously-visited decks to research artifacts and weapons which will provide you with bonuses for later on.While there are a few survivors dotted around, you never really interact with them; most of the plot is advanced through either the environment, with words written in blood covering the walls -- or through voice-logs and emails of the recently dead, much like in the game's spiritual successor, Bioshock. You're never taken out of the game; you're always in first-person perspective, and always quite alone...with mainly just the voices of the dead to keep you company!System Shock 2 isn't all roses though, especially with age. Games have moved on quite a bit, and without nostalgia to help ignore the flaws, new-comers might find the low-polygon creatures a little cartoonish, the graphics a little underwhelming, and generally just lacking the kind of polish you find nowadays. The game-play itself requires a more cautious-than-usual approach too -- not quite as cautious as the Thief series, but not quite as guns-blazing as most first person shooters -- which may put some off.If you're not afraid of rough edges and want to experience one of gaming's classic playgrounds, black out your room, slip on some surround-sound headphones, and enjoy.

												This game needs no introduction. It's regarded as one of the best games for PC ever made, as well as one of the best for its genre... and it is wholly deserving of all its praise. System Shock 2 is a game that defies any real review, to do so would to really spoil the experience. It needs to be played to understand why it is so good, and that is what playing it is: an experience.The game is a rare example of design, gameplay, aesthetic, atmosphere, and presentation all working in near perfect harmony to deliver an engrossing experience that pulls you in and keeps you going until the final hours are passed. The RPG elements are almost completely free form, allowing you to build your character in almost any way you like focusing on what you want as you want it (though in the early game you'll do well to focus on your initial strengths as to not spread yourself too thin), and while initial enemy placement is pre-determined you'll find out that they respawn with alarming frequency in random numbers and placements to constantly keep you on your toes. The game is not perfect, mind, and has some flaws. Most notable are the level designs for the final areas of the game don't seem quite as well designed as the rest of the game and some other small nitpicks, but these are minor gaffes in System Shock 2's excellent imageand are easily forgiven. If you like science fiction, survival horror, cyberpunk, body or eldritch horror, free form RPGs, first person shooters, adventure games, or any combination thereof of them, then System Shock 2 is well deserving of your attention. And hell, even if you don't like any of that stuff, it may be worth looking into just to try new things! You might just find yourself surprised.			"

This review is based on a purely vanilla playthrough.+ Game is very mod-able, & this can go a long way to polishing up some of its aged visuals, among other things+ Palpable and unsettling atmosphere+ Character is highly customizable (stats, not aesthetics), appealing to a wide swathe of varying play-styles+ Load-times are near-instantaneous on today's hardware+ Places an overwhelming emphasis on RPG elements, and does so competently+ Enemies do not saturate the game, successfully building a tremendous sense of solitude and despair+ Resources are scarce, lending a feeling of gravity to enemy encounters+ Despite a few minor misgivings, the UI is generally intuitive and well-designed+ Aside from one glaring plot hole, the story is inspired, well-presented, and entirely engrossing+ Managing resources is a prime concern, and really serves to pull you into the experience+ Ambient soundtrack keeps your hairs standing up; some of the tracks felt a bit out of place, but this did not strike me often, and overall I would consider the audio to be successfully employed- Default controls are horrid; I highly recommend remapping the key-bindings- Map and level designs often feel convoluted and poorly designed; the need for tedious backtracking is frequent and a chore- Dated visuals that have not aged well, particularly character modelsLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												One of the coolest significantly difficult games I've ever played. A blend of FPS with RPG mixed with Survival Horrorness. It also has very similar gameplay elements to Bioshock. Armour piercing bullets, anti personnel bullets, audio logs, hacking, vending machines, raging psychopaths, a kickass wrench (Which, I think, was more useful in this game than it was in Bioshock) and many others, only this game feels much more ""complex"" if that's the right word. This is no walk in the park. Highly recommended!			"

												I'm always apprehensive about reviewing classics. Anyone familiar with the game will already have their mind made up on it, and it's often hard to convince those who aren't to try it. I haven't played System Shock 2 since its release ages ago, and I'm happy to report that it holds up surprisingly well for newcomers and veterans alike. Not for the whole game, sadly, but for enough of it.System Shock 2 is one of the originators of the FPS/RPG genre, which spun out Deus Ex, Vampire, Bioshock, and all manner of dense shooters. You play a hacker stashed aboard the USS Von Braun, mankind's first faster-than-light starship. It becomes immediately apparent that issues have arisen during the voyage, and it's up to you to hopefully make things right. You do this by scavenging weapons and gadgets, hacking devices, upgrading your skills, researching the odd artifacts you come across, and killing lots of really, really freaky monsters. There's an enormous range of activities involved in growing your character, and a little of everything is required to keep up with the surprisingly varied enemies you encounter.The story is among the best the FPS genre has ever seen, detailing the final hours of the Von Braun's crew and leading you through every nook and cranny of the enormous ship. A competent minimap and extensive log of the audio files you find through the game help keep you on track as you progress through the ruined decks. Unfortunately, the game starts to come apart after you leave the Von Braun. The open maps and fully-realized levels give way to isolated setpieces and cramped, confusing halls filled with monsters. It's very clear the back end of the game was rushed, and it suffers terribly for it. Abuse of the quicksave system is a must near the end, which sadly drains a lot of the tension from the game.It really cannot be overstated how good the atmosphere is either, which makes its collapse near the end all the more tragic. The sound design is incredible, with unsettling cues popping up at all the right times. Well, except for the music which you should mute immediately, unless you have an irrational love for 90s programmer techno. Even the graphics hold up, with the bold colors and boxy designs masking the incredibly low-res textures. You'll feel like an idiot the first time a chunky-looking enemy makes you jump, but your heart will be pounding too much to care.It very much is a classic for a reason, and the precipitous drop in quality near the end still can't sully the first 8 or so hours. It's a long, long game, with plenty of secrets and scares to keep you engaged. If you've never played System Shock 2 I guarantee you're in for a treat, and if you haven't replayed it recently I can still promise the same.			"

												As much as I absolutely love this game, I'm going to try not to circlejerk about it, because it truly isn't for everyone. For one, it's damned frustrating and very difficult and takes quite a bit of patience, even on its easier difficulties, so if you're one to easily get put on tilt, this game isn't for you. Also, if you're obsessive over graphics, this game is not for you, because while there are add-ons that improve the graphics, the game still doesn't look nearly as good as modern games, with the one exception maybe being the corridor lighting, which still look fairly good today. System Shock 2 is an incredibly tense and scary experience; the game literally plays with your paranoia, with enemies that you can hear from far away and constant enemy respawn, you will never really feel safe. Unlike other select survival horror titles, the classic System Shock 2 can scare while still having excellent gameplay; it was one of the first titles (if not the first) to effectively merge the first person shooter and rpg genres. Additionally, it has open-world style level design that feels claustrophobic and fresh to this day and for days to come.Though most would agree that the majority of System Shock 2 is excellent, everybody who has played the full game will know what I am talking about when I say that the end bosses (which I won't spoil) are terrible. The unanimous consensus is generally that the ending is downright awful too; even people who enjoyed the ending (myself included) would tell you that it's only enjoyable because of how terrible and cheap it is.That being said, what are you waiting for? Go play System Shock 2, but only if you plan on playing it in its entirety, from start to finish.			"

												One of my all-time favorite games. I replay it every couple of years.Here I sit, having just completed my first (and last) playthrough on Impossible difficulty.All things considered, some tips from a veteran:-Every class starts with level one Standard Weapons, so you might as well go for that assault rifle by maxing out Standard Weapons ASAP.-Don't bother with powered armor. It's not worth the shortfall between charge stations. Get enough for Medium Armor and move along.-Save at least three ICE-PICKS for the very end of the game. Trust me.-Scavenge jammed shotguns off Shotgun Hybrids. Yes, they are useless, but they always have at least one round in the chamber.-Go Navy. They master in two categories straight out the gate.-Enemies aimbot. They don't shoot where you WERE, they shoot where you are GOING TO BE. Go into every encounter able to put down a baddy before it can fire, or be prepared to run.-You only need just enough to Repair your weapons, not modify or maintain them, until later in the game.-Even if you don't go Psi, invest enough cybernetic modules for Psi-Pull and Cryokinesis early on. This gives you access to many secrets as well as a modest fallback weapon when your guns jam or the bullets run dry.-Don't horde syringes. Strength Boost + Speed + Wrench works wonders on spiders.-Hacking, hacking, hacking. Those security crates won't crack themselves.Lastly, don't spend too much time fretting over cosmetic graphics and balance mods. The game looks and runs fine in vanilla mode. Light some candles, put on some headphones, and enjoy one of the best FPS / RPG hybrids ever made!			"

												In the year 2072 a rogue artificial intelligence known as SHODAN lost her mind. In her limitless imagination, SHODAN saw herself as a goddess, destined to inherit the Earth. That image was snuffed out by the hacker who created her...In September 1994 Looking Glass Studios shocked the PC gaming world. Famous for their work on Ultima Underworld, they had decided to branch out into the realm of science fiction, and so System Shock was born. Thought it was never commercially successful, its successful blend of sci-fi action and horror gained a massive cult following. In 1999 Looking Glass partnered with Irrational Games to produce a sequel, System Shock 2. It also fared about the same commercially as it's predecessor, quickly becoming a cult classic as well. To this day original copies are still highly sought out by collectors, often fetching exorbitantly high prices. However thanks to the efforts of a mysterious hacker named le Corbeau, System Shock 2 has now been remastered and re-released on Steam with full compatibility for modern PCs.System Shock 2 takes place a full 42 years after the events of the original game. As the events on Citadel Station fade into memory, the Faster-Than Light starship Von Braun is on its maiden voyage, and you are a soldier assigned to the military vessel Rickenbacker to provide security during the Von Braun's shakedown run. Things however do not go as planned, and all hell breaks loose. You awaken with amnesia some time after everything has gone south, and it is up to you to try and find out what fate has befallen the two ships and their crews. The stunningly written narrative is presented to you by audio logs and emails left behind by crew members, and it serves as a chilling reminder of how alone you truly are out here in space.Gameplay-wise, System Shock 2 is quite similar to its predecessor, seemingly being a first person shooter at first glance. Once you get into the fray however, it quickly becomes apparent that LGS has created a seamless blend of RPG and survival horror. The controls may seem a bit strange at first, but they add a whole range of movements rarely seen in the genre. However if you want a more traditional WASD setup, you can quickly remap everything to your liking. Near infinite possibilities exist to customize your character as the game progresses, letting you mold your game experience to suit your playing style.If there are any failings that I could point out about the original System Shock 2 it would be the limited video options and a handful of rampant bugs that can seriously put a damper on what can be considered to be the greatest game ever made. However the Steam release fixes all of these problems, and has completely redefined the experience. If System Shock 2 is the king of all sci-fi horror games, then consider this to be an extra layer of polish on its crown. If you consider yourself at all to be a PC gamer, then you owe it to yourself to buy this game. There is still nothing currently out there that can match it, and there likely will not be for a very long time.			"

												A survival, horror, sci-fi, immersive, atmospheric, brilliant RPG FPS. The story alone is worth a playthrough, and the story is told in a way that only a game can. (Think half life 2.)This game deserves every game of the year award it got, and it should have gotten more.The direct inspiration to the Bioshock series in mechanics, but without the dumbing down.It's an old game these days, so do yourself a favor and grab a graphics mod. Then close the blinds, put on headphones, and set up a booby trap for anyone sneaking up on you, because you are about to be sucked into a tense, wonderful experience aboard the Von Braun you will never forget.

												Looking Glass Studios basically laid down the roadmap for the FPS/RPG hybrid with System Shock 2. Though it didn't take off in the mainstream til Deus Ex and Bioshock. SS2 remains as legendary as the careers it jumpstarted.Everything about SS2 basically took a defibrilator to the original game and kickstarted it into overdrive. The plot was expanded to the point of reading like the good Aliens sequel we never got. The gameplay was treated like both an actual RPG and an engaging first person shooter, complete with unique ever changing environments and weapons. But that's not even touching the surface of this game. The most memorable aspect of SS2 is it's horror atmosphere. The electronica soundtrack only adds to the tension of how scary this game is. Enemies shuffle and appear in corridors you thought you cleared already, weapons jam if you don't take care of them, and you're constantly searching and praying to find someone alive. But unfortunately as you search, it seems more and more likely you're the only one still human.SS2 is truly a work of art, and it's great to see it fixed up and running in modern resolutions. Considering how often this game goes on sale, you owe it to yourself to see where Bioshock and Dead Space all got it from. System Shock 2, ""dat game"".			"

												Better than BioShock, better than 1st Half-Life. Game is unbelievable. It looks ju-ust a bit dated but who cares when it's got such a deep gameplay. RPG elements, vast variety of weapons and skills, controls - all this makes SS2 a great fun to play. Atmosphere is where the game steals the show. You a fan of Sci-Fi horror? Then what the fyck are you waiting for, buy this game! You are aboard the spaceship, everyone is infected and controlled by an alien force and your a.s.s. must find out what's going on over here. This is bold definition of awesome. Plus I wanna shake composers' hands - music score blasts you the hell away. Weak points? Maybe some NPC models. That is all I can come up with. SystemShock 2 oozes value and you'll never regret paying money for this product.			"

												Quick review, 3 words: BUY THIS GAME!No i'll be more detailed than that, but seriously buy this game.To start with, fans of bioshock who have not heard of this game will be greeted instantly by a very familiar storyline. Infact it's almost an EXACT CLONE of this game (and whats the first weapon? That's right kids, it's the wrench).  You say ""EVE"", I say ""PSI"". You say upgrade stations? i say upgrade stations, aaaannd finally you say ADAM i say cyborg points. Fans will also notice a rather large ""Dead Space"" feel as well and to be honest, many think that Dead Space was in early development going to be System Shock 3... (if this is so, THANK YOU STAR INSURANCE! WE LOVE YOU FOR NOT LETTING THIS HAPPEN! *ahem*).The graphics (to some) are low budget and a little to old, as well as the models (we shall ignore these people, they are fools). However saying this the lighting and levels themselves still manage to give it a dark, moody atmosphere walking round the cyberpunk infused science vessel ""INNNNN SPAAAAAACE!"" (and i deny ANYONE to say cyborg mid-wives have lost their freaky edge). Also, in true old-style FPS fasion, there are alot of keys to use to the untrained eye, however players soon realise they are not mandatory and to be honest are there only for other play styles from that era (believe it or not some players used to use keyboard ONLY on fps back then... I know can you believe that?).So yes for new and old gamers BUY THIS, either on GOG or here. Doesn't matter, its worth it and if you dont like the graphics then there are literally 15 years worth of mods (many of which got updated due to it's re-release) and yes as its Night Dive the community did most of the work for them and as usual, used it :/ (you will notice this recuring pattern with them) so they could not F""$% this one up even if they tried to.Also once again, thank you star insurance for making sure no one took this and ""EA'ed"" in all these years (fingers crossed this new one won't do this either... ).EDIT: Nominated this for test of time award. Go on, you know it makes sense ;)			"

												This game is outstanding.By far my second favorite game on steam.If you are speed running or playing the long way, it is still a fun experience. This game is better than all the bioshocks because the bioshocks abandoned some concepts and made them minute.If you are a fan of bioshock give this game a chance. It has far more content to offer to the table and is a way more complex game. I really enjoy the atmosphere the game provides. You can explore and experience your own adventure. There is just so much on the map that you could spend hours longer than needed to complete an objective. The game is also a survival horror.I highly recommend this game.			"

												System Shock 2 was one of the best games I had ever played back in 1999. Many generations of games later, I gave it another try. It's a true testament to its game design that it kept my interest enough to play it through in its entirety once again. It is hard to say if a relatively new gamer would like it, with so many newer games out there, (Dead Space comes to mind and is a lot creepier, with much better action), so I don't know if I can fully recommend it to them. I will say for vintage gamers like myself (mid 40's), it's worth a try...or if you are younger and nostalgic, or interested in the history of great video games.			"

												The year was 1999 when I first played this game. I had never and have never played the original System Shock but that never put me off. I'd seen and heard good things so I was eager to try it out. And try it out I did! So, what did I think?It blew my F**KING mind! So complex and way ahead of its time. The first FPS I had played with an inventory system, audio logs and options to upgrade your statistics. It was very different to other shooters I had played. This was in a whole new league. Graphically it looked really good with music that complemented the eerie feel of the game. Speaking of eerie, this game is scary. The voices of the enemies is creepy and I'm not even going to mention the psychic monkeys, lest I break into a fit of pure terror. Combat is good though you must maintain your weapons if you don't want them to break. Melee combat feels slow and clunky.The story... ah the story. From beginning to end the narrative manages to hold your attention and takes you on a great adventure, exploring every nook and cranny of your environment. The 'female' antagonist is one of the best ever portrayed in a video game.A truly fantastic game back in 1999 and a great game now in 2015. I still wait in hope of a System Shock III.10/10			"

												It's strange, when you're primarly a console gamer you miss out on some really amazing titles and yet you'll never really know it until you start playing on a PC.  For me this was the case with System Shock 2.  This game is everything I want in a game and have ♥♥♥♥♥ed about other games lacking for years now.  Ironic since this title predates the ones I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about.  The difficulty can take a while to adjust to however if you stick with it and learn the combat system (Get use to melee) and item management you'll start to really appreciate what this game does.This game is a masterpiece.

You travel within the glory of my memories, insect. I can feel your fear as you tread the endless expanse of my mind...I was 12 years old when I first played System Shock 2. I had just received some spending money at Christmas, and decided to go to a local game store to pick up something to play. It was there that I ran across an unassuming box, stamped with an ""EA Classics"" banner (which I still own) that had what appeared to be a sinister-looking woman hovering over a ship in deep space. Thinking it could be a fun little title, I took it home expecting to be entertained.It wasn't long until I was reloading a save, practically wetting myself in terror as my character stood outside a cargo bay, listening to ambient chatter from robots that busted out of containers and were trying to hunt me down, and getting instasniped by a turret when I rounded the corner.SS2 is a game that is absolutely dripping in atmosphere and dread. It makes the very act of walking down a hallway an unnerving, terrifying experience. Yet it remains one of my favorite games of all time, and one I've returned to many times over the years. It is an action-RPG that takes everything great about horror games and applies it to the sci-fi/cyberpunk genre.The game may seem a little dated and archaic now, but back then there was nothing like it. Everything from the interesting set-up (your four-year tour of duty is actually a class/skill selection process), the way the backstory is told through audio logs and final journals, the desolate and unnerving atmosphere and the variety of weapons/armor that could be found (and crafted) added up to a landmark experience.I have so many fond memories of this game. Seeing my health whittled down to nothing and taking potshots at robots in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Failing to catch an escape pod and walking back through a hallway, only to have to retreat and start firing madly with a shotgun when a horde of techno-zombies appeared in front of me. Crafting a crystal sword and using it to great effect... on dangerous monkeys in a gym that were firing off bolts of energy in my direction.I couldn't even finish the game the first time I played it, as I crafted a build that was way too reliant on tech skills. I then found myself low on ammo and medicine while trying to sprint through the Body of the Many as a horde of grotesque abominations chased me. SS2 is a game that definitely doesn't hold your hand, but rewards exploration and experimentation.And that's not even getting into the original queen bee herself, SHODAN. Everything from Terri Brosius' masterful performance to the worst-kept secret (and simultaneous best surprise) in the game oozes villainous appeal. You can be fighting off Machine Mothers while trying to dodge security cameras, and SHODAN will still be pushing you to continue on while simultaneously telling you that you're an ""insect"" and that you can't comprehend what she's doing. SHODAN is a terrifying but oddly reassuring companion throughout the game and a large part of what has made it so iconic.This is a title I've carried the torch for over the years, via its CD version, an abandonware copy I turned to because it fixed a major bug and this most recent release from Night Dive Studio, who did a stellar job negotiating the rights to publish both this and the original 1994 title.There's a reason why this is considered part of the late-90s ""holy trinity"" alongside Thief 2 and Deus Ex. The innovations SS2 pioneered are still being felt in large and small ways in the gaming industry, both in its influences for franchises like Dead Space and Bioshock and narrative techniques that fully immerse the player into the world without being preachy.I highly, highly recommend the game. It's one you should play if you haven't done so already.			"

												After playing this in a handful of long sittings I can now say this is an absolutely fantastic game. Sites all over the net made it clear this is a must play game, being in numerous top 10 games of all time and top 10 RPGs of all time lists. And I have to say it's certainly made mine too! For starters the setting; Sci-fi/Cyberpunk. It looks great! Obviously to today's standards the graphics are poor but if you're like most sane and decent gamers you won't let that stop you from playing it. If it makes you feel any better there are mods to improve the graphics, but I always recommend playing games vanilla first time through to get the intended feel of the game. The game is a First-person shooter/Roleplaying hybrid that is well known with classic Looking Glass games. Again to today's standards the combat may be a little but clunky but overall get's the job done. My only minor nitpick is the wrench as it's so damn annoying to attack smaller enemies because it's constantly missing! In terms of roleplaying you have a lot to work with, with the potential for 3 different types of characters it adds a lot of replay value as well as the potential for many character builds. Personally I went in as the typical soldier/'warrior' build and just beefed up on strength and my guns but you could master tech hacking your way through levels opening chests and disabling security or you could us PSI (Psionics - Imagine it as System Shocks 'magic') This type of character gives you tonnes of skills like shields, telekinesis, firing projectiles and so much more. So many potential character builds and different ways to approach the game. System Shock 2 also comes under another genre, survival horror. Now for the most part I'd say it is a First-person shooter, action roleplaying game, However the atmosphere in most of the levels of this game is intense. The enemies themselves creep around the decks of the ship stalking you and I'm not going to lie they made me jump and made me scream like a little girl on numerous occasions, especially earlier in the game when I felt underpowered. The way the NPCs speak is also quite chilling at times. I would say however that as the game progresses, some of the later levels lose that horror edge, but it doesn't completely detract from the game. Now a few final things to finish up on. The major thing I disliked about this game was movement, again It's an old game, old engine, old physics etc, but getting stuck in tiny nooks and crannies was seriously frustrating (I'm looking at you last levels!) And although I love the climbing in this game (It works like Thief) some times it was unresponsive and unpredictable. And of course we can't forget the story. It's great, It's not the best story but it's certainly good and I think you should experience it for yourself! System Shock 2 - 9/10			"

												1999.Ken Levine, in co-develope with Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios, brought us one of the most expected sequel of the last century. System Shock 2. Mixing RPG, FPS, Survival Horror and Adventure.After 30 years, TriOptimums went to bankruptcy and all the stock was bought by a Russian company named A. Korenchkin, who restored the company after a decade and its signing now weapon contracts with politicians and military organizationes.Then 12 after the events in Citadel TriOptimum is restored, in fact is now testing a new FTL ship, called the Von Braun which is not alone. Another ship is following it, named Rickenbacker. Why? Simple, Rickenbacker does not have a FTL device, so it needs to be ""attached"" to the Von Braum for the trip.5 months after and you´ll wake up in your cryo-tube inside the Von Braum to find out that something has happened there...This is just an introduction about the plot, which is very interesting. Now lets move to the gameplay.System Shock uses the Dark Engine (yep the same as Thief: Dark Project) but it is slightly different. It wasnt finished so the programmers were fixing bugs when encountered. BUT this only makes things better, because they were working closely with the engine code allowing them to ""create"" or ""write"" additional features. Thats why we said that the Dark Engine in SS2 is the Enhanced Dark Engine. In addition to this fact the DE (Dark Engine) was able to display a wide variety of colored lighting, thats why SS2 uses some tricks with lighting and sounds to create a perfect atmosphere of terror.The worst part about the DE is the limit in the polygons (only 1024), but this can be fixed with some mods, besides if you´re not a Graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ you´ll deal with it.As i said above, this game has consciousness about his best points, sound and lighting, but we are not talking about screamers. We are talking about subtle Terror full of hues, as the good terror-touch should be. Just an example, during the game, youll heard the enemies claiming this response ""We are part of the many"" this ""many"" is the ""Hive"" created by the enemies to defeat the human beings in the ships, now they know (and WE know) that you are alone, and they try to delve into that fact to psychically destroy you.As for the RPG, SS2 keeps a good Skill-System that allows you to perform a wide variety of actions during the game, this is possible with the ""Cyber-modules"" given as rewards for searching or completing objectives. But this is a good CRPG system so you wont be able to upgrade EVERYTHING. Here it is why:-First, it encourages you to replay the game. Every skill build will be different, each one will provide you something, and EVERYTHING can be a tool to achieve your goal, win the game.-Secondly, and the most remarkable. It adds difficulty to the game. Difficulty its not a way to qualify a game. But it helps to define it, here in SS2 you wont be able to restore your Cybermodules, they are limited, valuable and its use will reward you, so be mindful of your purpose.-Thirdly, motivation. Want to be the best Psico/Hacker/Soldier/etc..? Give your best. Dont expect to be the best being a passive-player, the more you risk the more you´ll achieve. Some room will have nanites (money) or another item that you need, and OF COURSE they´ll be enemies around, turrets or security robots, so break your mind, build up your tactic and try to overcome adversity in order to improve your character.Apart from CRPG, Adventure and Horror the shooter part is so well oiled, i mean seriously you have an entire arsenal to use, every weapon has its own stats, effects and mechanics, so you can ALWAYS get another weapon, avoiding that bland part in every game when you only get 1 weapon for all things...Also the game includes a degradation and maintenance of the weapons and a variety of ammo.Back in the day this game was relevant, nice scores, many awards, positives reviews...But only the time bring System Shock 2 to the summit, it has a lot of followers, a Cult Follower, an active community of modders since 1999... I know that i left a lot of things in the inkwell, but this game is that sort of game that must be played, not read.			"

												Imagine your very person, locked up in a cryogenic chamber aboard a gigantic starship en route to a very distant place from home. Imagine yourself, facing dreadful foes who have never seen the face of Earth. Imagine both your mind and body enprisoned within an enormous metallic beast with close-to-nothing to survive. Will you manage it? Or you will let Mankind's demise shrivel from your unstill hands? Okay that was a dramatic way to put it, but it gives you the idea of how much this game affects me. We have a very deep plot as well as a good Cyberpunk atmosphere, furthermore there is an endless line of items!The faults that this game has are various:-Old (can be renewed with mods)-You don't want it to end! (remember when you played for the first time DE:HR? Same thing here! You don't want it to end! (Luckily there is the stunning editor explored in detail furtherly)MULTIPLAYER WARNING!I noticed that when using two or more Windows XPs (who got them anymore?) there are no so many crashes. However if you do use an XP and a 7 (or just two modern guys) you got problems (this is probably due to some sync issue or just Win 7 can't bear it to have such an old guy like that).I DO RECOMMEND:1) GRAPHICS ENHANCEMENTThe graphics can be enhanced through a variety of mods which you can find here:https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=4447.0orhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/shtup-system-shock-2-texture-upgrade2) DROMED (or ShockEd)And there is DromEd, a powerful Editor which will boost gameplay (if you have both patience and time):https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?board=38.0Take a seat during free-time, and watch the tutorials which are very helpful. BE SURE TO INSTALL THE TOOLKIT AT:https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=5312.03) THE ORIGINALI would recommend to play the first installment of System Shock in order to get the bigger picture of what SHODAN is, after you finished the second one. Why? Because otherwise it would spoil everything. You are so lucky if you do not know the existence of the first installment or whatever goes on there, for you can enjoy this game far way better.You can find it online:https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=211.0You can find it here on Steam too! (but for a price)It is aged, but works just fine. This is just for old-timers.In short:Every game you play (from FPS to RPGs) has been directly or indirectly been inspired by this true masterpiece. So if you do not have it, well it's like missing Dante's Trilogy in your home library (well not that so, but say something like a must-have).Okay this looks like a game with inefable emotions attached to it. You can either buy it (suggested) or not (God Bless You).Thanks for reading.			"

												You know what's so special about this game? The fact that the graphics are bad. Well, I mean you can improve them with mods which make them look ok, but nothing compared to what today's games can accomplish. That means that the only way this game maintains it's horror aspect is through crushingly oppressive atmosphere, and sound design. Most of the voice acting is very good, and results in a convincing sense of urgency and panic. I heard in a different review for this game that a part of the voice acting that makes it so good and adds to the atmosphere is that the characters don't sound dramatic, they only wish to be heard in a hopes that someone will recieve the message. Other parts of the sound design hold up very well. (some of it even sounds still today very disturbing.) Before I go any further, I must mention the writing is also superb. The hybrids sound scary and tortured, begging you the protagonist to put them out of their misery. The humans sound scared and panicked adding more to the loneliness of the atmosphere. And the cyborg midwifes are beyond terrifying, their humanity washed away by mechanical brainwash, and their monotone voices muttering the most unrealistic yet perfectly written dialogue that makes you almost want to avoid them entirely. (This is my personal experience, tell me how you reacted to them when you get to deck three.) I'm not mentioning anything about the rpg mechanics just because I feel like the game is worth playing just for the atmosphere, I am stunned how well this game still terrifies after eighteen years. Play it, it is definitely worth it. This system shock games are terrific, and I feel they should get moer recognition compared to the bioshock games. (While great games as well, I do not feel they hold up nearly as well if you think on a broader spectrum.) Enjoy the game, it is amazing even to this day.			"

												I played this after BioShock but I like this one more.  The elderly graphics don't bother me too much, but then I am used to older games.  The story is fantastic and you can easily see where the developers incorporated the plot from this game into BioShock.SHODAN is easily one of the best video game villains of all all time.  Her voice is both terrifying and seductive and she gives me the absolute creeps.  The Many was no slouch, either. It's not easy to find a scary game that disturbs me.  I've seen a lot of horror and I'm not easily freaked out by monsters, gore, or jump scares.  System Shock 2, however, provides a haunting experience that I highly recommend.There are clunky aspects to the game, however, since the RPG stat-building elements are not well-balanced.  Some paths are far more viable than others, and the game practically begs you to take hacking as a skill.  Even so, it can be fun to make a strange build to provide a greater challenge. And speaking of challenge, I appreciated what I experienced in System Shock 2.  It's very easy to die in this game, and you need to be conservative if you rely on ammo to kill most enemies because they do respawn.  If you're careful and focus on melee during the early levels you can do well near the end game, but even when I did that the final areas took me a few tries to complete.  When compared to BioShock, which provides most of its challenge at the beginning of the game, this was very refreshing.  It's my favorite game on Steam for a reason!			"

												I had heard great things about this game, which BioShock is said to be a spiritual sequel of, so when I saw it on sale, I decided to buy it to give it a try. And I don't regret it. The comparisons between this and BioShock are pretty much spot on, but I must say that this game seems like a more complex version of BioShock; a great thing, in my opinion.The gameplay is pretty varied, from the number of different weapons you can get, to the psionic abilities. The RPG aspects are pretty good as well, allowing you to customize your character according to your playstyle. The weapons get damaged over time, which means that you must perform maintenance on them periodically, otherwise they'll end up breaking (you can still repair them, though). The hacking mechanic is good, and the research function, which sometimes requires you to find the appropriate elements for your research is excellent.As far as environments go, you can go almost anywhere. You can return to earlier sections of the ship to look for stuff you left there, and all the different decks have their unique style. There's a good variety of enemies, each with their own weaknesses and strength, which you can learn about by researching their organs after you kill them. It also has a good soundtrack, and the story, without spoilers, is excellent.I really recommend this game, especially if you enjoyed the original BioShock.			"

												I just can't get enough of this game... Ever since I beat it I can't stop thinking about it. This is easily one of the best games I've ever played. There is nothing else like it... Which sucks. The atmosphere of this game in incredible, it's mix of RPG elements and survival horror are unmatched, and the story and audio are phenomenal. I will say however that this game WILL NOT hold your hand! It can be very hard and sometimes frustrating. So if you don't like a challenge you can always put it on easy without it ruining the experience. If you don't have this game though you need to buy it. It goes on sale quite often so there is no excuse. This game is a classic that sits up there with the ranks of Half Life, Portal, and Bioshock. 9.5/10			"

Is that sparking noise a broken panel, or a killer robot around the next corner?You can tell where you are in the ship just by the ambient engine hum, and there's nothing quite like hearing a cyborg midwive's lullaby while you are low on health.

												One of the best games of all time and masterfully crafted by one of the best game developers to ever have existed, System Shock 2 stands proud as a paragon of game design. The atmosphere, gameplay, story, and sound design are all so top notch that I have doubts any game will ever surpass it. If you can handle the immense difficulty, terrifying horror, and somewhat dated graphics, then by all means pick up this game and play it through to the finish. It is, at the very least, worth a playthrough in order to better understand one of the highest-praised video games in history.			"

												System Shock 2 is truly the pinnacle of Sci-Fi horror. It combines complex, deep and challenging gameplay into one sweet result. The game feels overwhelming at first but once you get past the 2 or 3 hours mark you slowly start to understand how the game works. The game's complex level design makes exploring very satisfying, and very rewarding too. Audio logs contains usefull passwords and stuff, really easy to miss. So its really important to look everywhere before continuing on. Enemies spawn at random too, so you can come back to an earlier zone and there will still be hybrids roaming around. Kinda forces you to stay on your guard at all times. The game features a pretty elaborate research system, too. If you pick up a strange item, you can research it and get damage bonus on certain enemies or even use the items as temporary upgrades on you. However there's a catch, you can't just research everything you want. You have to find special chemicals stored inside rooms in some levels. Not all levels share the same chemicals too, so you have to check in every room for the required chemicals. I thought that was pretty deep and well conceived. I thought there was too few items to reasearch too. theres maybe 10~ total.The game features an evil AI called Shodan. Probably my favorite antagonist in any game ever. The developpers made sure to handle the characther with great care, every single of her quotes are all very memorable and devilishly creepy. The atmostphere in this game is perfect. Don't let the old graphics scare you away. The graphics adds a certain charm to the game, there is nothing quite like the atmosphere you can find in System Shock 2. I believe its atsmophere is what makes the game so special in its own way. Hacking seems complicated at first, but it becomes pretty simple when you discover that you cant do anything about it and that your hacking stats does everything for you. Basicly, you just have to click the blue squares and hope something good happens! Its a good idea to upgrade every hacking skills though. The game actually requires you to hack something to make progress. So you cant run away from it.All in all i think its a fantastic game and is worth everyone's attention. Its captivating gameplay and atmosphere is sure to make any hardcore rpg fans very satisfied! "

												I probably won’t be saying much of what has already been said about this game, but in my opinion System Shock 2 is one of the most pivotal games to hit the market.  System Shock 2 arguably created a type of genre that has been and is still being mimicked/used to this day in the gaming market; and that genre is what I call the FPS/RPG survival hybrid; you see this ‘inventory and upgrade’ based system in many of today’s games for both survival and shooter style games alike.  System Shock 2, although somewhat antiquated for today’s standards was very groundbreaking for its time (this could be said about both SS1 and 2), but without saying more repetitive rhetoric that’s already been said I will get down to the pro/con list in this game that I think is appropriate:Pros:-Groundbreaking FPS/RPG hybrid that works very well even to today’s standards.-Very immersive atmosphere (it really does feel like your there).-Fluid and extremely customizable and varied control scheme system (you can even save your control scheme setup!).-Varied options in terms of playstyle and choice of weaponry.-Various interesting choices and options that actually make you THINK in which a lot of modern games today even lack.-Small options and features that only add to the immersion such as weapon customization and maintenance, hacking games, inventory management perks and sub-perks, and a currency system for hacking and the purchasing of items via ‘value-rep/vending machines’ (you can even add markers on the mini map and name them as well as add markers in the level in real-time).-Occurrences in the game that were some of the first of their kind (‘meeting shodan’ for example).-A game engine that seems to have stood the test of time (with the recent (and even old) updates to the game it runs extremely fluid on pretty much all modern systems).-Fun and satisfying combat.-The game creates an overall feeling of fear and tension that was done well.-Interesting and diverse enemies to fight against.-Very high replay value.Cons:-Some of the options available for upgrade/purchase can be redundant and useless (although every option does have its uses depending on playstyle and skill level of the player).-Some minor bugs/exploits.-cyber interface and control scheme can be somewhat complicated for new players.Overall I consider System Shock 2 to be one of my few personal all-time favorite games and I place it high on my list.  I feel that if you enjoy FPS games and like deep immersion you really should consider giving this game a try.  My rating breakdown:-.1 some redundant upgrade and weapon choices dependent somewhat upon playstyle-.1 minor bugs/exploits(10-.2 = 9.8)Final rating of 9.8/10			"

												This game is old. However, it does so many things right that even modern video games can't get right.If you like old, classic games, or just want to visit for a nostalgia trip of 90s gaming this game is a must buy! It is one of the best by far!Pros:- Voice acting is CRISP CLEAN! Even the audio logs (or whatever they're called).-Atmosphere is great (makes you really feel you're in a screwed up situation)-One of the best villains of all time (Shodan <3)-Amazing horror elements-Alright story (my opinion)-Great level designCons-There are WAY too many audio logs-AI can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times-Sometimes it's hard even on Easy mode.-I never got into using PSI very often. -The UI isn't perfect. It's a bit clunky.-The normal weapon recoil is just stupid.-They could have done a better job on the tutorial.-I never got multiplayer to workOverall, despite the issues it has it is quickly overcome when you get used to it. And it's a smooth experience there after.**** There are no friendly NPCs in the game due to the memory limitations from the 90s. I refused to put it on the list as a con as it was a problem way back in 1999 and they really can't do anything about it now. But yes, due to this the game can get pretty lonely at times. You just want to see a friendly face after a while.*But hey! There are mods to make your experience better ya know! ;)Buy this game immediately! Or buy it on a sale like I did for a $1.50. System Shock 2 is a steal for that price! Because yes, there are better games for the same price or even lower. So I'd recommend waiting for a sale. But either way this game is worth every penny.This game sits on one of my favourite games of all time! It's good! It's fun! It gives a good experience! And has one of the most memorable villains of all time! Shodan <3My overall score to System Shock 2 is a 8/10. Despite its problems it's well worth for its time.It's a must buy.			"

												It may have been overshadowed by the scope of its contemporary, Deus Ex, and the streamlined accessibility of its spiritual successor, BioShock, but System Shock 2 was unique in its day and still holds its own today as a classic First-Person Action RPG, providing an experience that, unfortunately, still hasn't quite been reproduced in any other game since.The original System Shock was somewhat ahead of its time (consequently it suffered from questionable execution of some of its ideas such as with its controls) whereas Shock 2 arrived at just the right time to help define the Immersive Sim genre with an arguably more refined take on the cyberpunk horror concept. Created from a collaboration between Looking Glass Studios and Irrational Games, Shock 2 has many similar traits to other games from the school of immersive sims such as Thief and the aforementioned Deus Ex. Atmosphere, world-building and multi-solution problems - all pillars of the genre - are to be found here in abundance.With deep customization trees that allow you to use all kinds of weapons and tools and develop exotic powers, Shock 2 allows you to approach the game in a variety of ways, and then return to its creepy hallways with a new character build for a different experience. Enlist with the Marines to wield the heavy-duty military weapons found scattered across the Von Braun; or spend some time in deep space with the Navy and learn to use highly technical engineering tools such as hacking and energy-based weapons; or maybe you'd rather get in touch with your inner zen and gain mastery in the powers of the mind. Shock 2 might make you work to earn each and every skill point, but it rewards investment into specialisations.Shock 2's story is told through an impressive number of different narrative devices, each serving to slowly reveal the mysterious ship, its previous owners, and its new inhabitants. Clear plot points and objectives keep you moving forward through the numerous decks of the ship. While wireless transmissions, audio logs and emails are the norm in today's games, they were still new and innovative when Shock 2 made use of them. The game steers clear from technical hurdles that would shatter your immersion - there are no awkward NPCs to draw you out of the experience - instead, the game emphasizes isolation and loneliness, and the characters come to life through their voices, whether logging their last moments or speaking into your receiver to instruct you with dubious intent. In fact, the sound design may be Shock 2’s crowning achievement. The doom-ambiance of the cargo bays will be an enduring memory for those who have gone through that harrowing ordeal. The multitude of enemies identify themselves through their terrifying sounds, such as the tragi-horrific moans from grunts of the Many, urging you to kill them, and the ear-splitting screeches of the psi-enhanced monkeys. The iconic antagonist SHODAN is memorably characterized by her evilly seductive and corrupted speech, echoing throughout the ship and reverberating within your skull.Shock 2 won’t be considered a looker today - it certainly wasn't at the time either - but there are a few community-built mods available to help make it more palatable to the eye. By and large, you’ll still have to develop a taste for its neon-green cyberpunk aesthetics and hard-hitting techno soundtrack, but if you do, you’ll find plenty of interesting enemies and well-realised locations as you explore. The layout of the ship follows a believable structure, with different decks for different purposes such as the Medical wing that you start out in, and the Recreational deck complete with a swimming pool and basketball court. The HUD successfully feels like a cool sci-fi neural interface, allowing you to manage your inventory, browse through your logs and emails, upgrade your software and even conduct research on unknown materials. Not to mention the inclusion of a mini game console, complete with game titles to collect like Overworld Zero, a roguelike to help you unwind during your downtime or to kill the minutes as a security alarm ticks down. The combat might feel rather stiff and clumsy owing to the game’s dated engine, but if you approach every scenario with careful preparation and strategic thinking, you’ll overcome the odds without much fumbling.All of which is to say that there is so much to System Shock 2 that is worth your time. It’s not easy to get into, but it’s almost impossible to let go of.  It rewards exploration of its mechanics, environments and story. It is a classic that endures the test of time and continues to influence games and gamers, a decade on.			"

												This is the greatest video game ever made.I realize that's a hard sell.It's also the truth, at least, in my own personal opinion. Rebind the keys, check out PC Gaming Wiki's modding guide to improve the archaic graphics, put on some headphones, stick it up on a good-sized monitor (something that takes up a lot of your field of view, ideally), get past the initial opening hump, and experience the game that inspired so many greats, from Bioshock to Portal, Dead Space to Fallout 3.System Shock 2 is the game that inspired a friend of mine to say ""hey, you're right, Doc, it is better than Bioshock!"" One of the highest-rated games of all time, but System Shock 2 outdoes it. It's a better horror game, a better adventure game, a better RPG, and an all-around better game than Bioshock. Its widespread influence on gaming is undeniable, and at least, if not more influential, than Half-Life.Yeah, it's old, so it looks ugly and doesn't have the kind of animation quality you might find in a newer game. Yeah, the weapons degrade, and some people don't like that. Yeah, the key bindings are weird and awful. But it's great. This game has some of the best atmosphere and storytelling you'll ever encounter, and the experience will sear itself into your brain, the way staring at the sun sears itself onto your eyeballs.You may play games you think are better, but you'll be hard-pressed to admit that this isn't one of the best games of all time.There is no better horror game than this. There are fewer, if any, better gaming narratives than this. Nothing possesses the same emotional highs and lows, even when almost directly copying the game, as Bioshock and Dead Space did.Remember Citadel. Remember 45100. Have a blast. You won't regret trying.			"

												Great game. Scary at some points. Something about monsterus humans screaming about how you should run because they don't have control of their bodies gives me the creeps.The game is an old deus ex like shooter. It has all the fun stuff like save scumming and an overly complex character customization system. I mean there are like 7 systems in place at the same time to consider when upgrading your character. Psy stuff, stat points, weapon proficiency, etc. All different categories. On top of that there’s weapon durability to consider, (weapons jam and have to be hacked or repaired in a different way when warn down) type of armour that’s best for a situation to consider and the whatever-they’re-called things that give passive bonuses but run out of rechargeable energy things to equip. There’s a whole lot of complicated systems at play in this game. SS2 comes from an era before game systems were dumbed-down for players.Enemies respawn but supplies don’t meaning that you’re always sort of on a clock until you’re screwed with no ammo. At some points there are ‘hallways of death’ that are over-tuned and spawn too many enemies every time you have to pass through them. The game encourages specializing in one weapon type but is sparse with ammo suggesting the use of multiple weapons be the best course of action.In the early part of the game character logs that play back audio are great. Latter on in the game enemies are way more powerful and there’s not really a moment of downtime to listen to them. They stack up. This isn’t a big deal.The whole psy stuff is cumbersome. Basically the game has a system of using things similar to dues ex augments. Stuff like ‘use this much energy to get a 2 minute long damage reduction shield.’ It’s hard to specialize in psy weapon stuff when you don’t know ahead of time if you’ll ever even use half the abilities they provide. Changing abilities in battle is also hazardous.The game has a great pace. The game introduces new enemies one at a time. It builds up to the moment and the enemies are really hard when first encountered. Then as time goes on and the player becomes more powerful and new enemies are introduced the old enemies become easy to deal with. This is fun and makes you feel powerful despite your power increase coinciding with the increase of power of enemies.The game can’t be stealth’d. This is no dues ex. If an enemy is close they know where you are.The game has a fun twist where you were being directed by the evil AI the entire time. Going-in to the game, basically reading any sort of thing such as the description of the game you’d know ahead of time this was going to happen so this isn’t a spoiler. The thing is: since you know it’ll happen you sort of just wait for it and it’s a bit of a let down.For some reason the main character can just sort of see ghost custseans every so often. The game explains it with some techno mumbo jumbo. It’s as if the game devs wanted to put everything into the game including the kitchen sink. They really packed the game with stuff that seems unnecessary. Remember before when I mentioned the 7 systems at play at once. Same sort of thing here. There’s no need for randomly 5 or so ghost events to happen for no reason.The game sort of has a pothole where the AI you’re working with takes over all the ship’s systems but security cameras and bots and stuff are still against you. Wtf? By the way the entire game, well most of it is on a super massive space ship. It even has a shopping mall. It feels like a ship that can support having a shopping mall in it. It’s just that big. There’s a bit of backtracking in the game. It’s fun to go back to old areas. The first wing of the game is basically getting access to 5 main floors of the ship. It feels like a cohesive world when all floors are accessible. Then the game’s like whops there’s a new elevator and now the game is a more linier path forward until the end. Then eventually the player gets to a point of no-going-back and it feels bad to never revisit all the areas cleared of alien infection. BTW there’s an alien parasite sort of thing and that’s why everyone’s dead. The AI you work with made it in SS1.Anyways. Good game over-all. The very end’s trippy. The final cutsean of the game’s hilarious. No spoilers.			"

												A very complex game. It has a lot of RPG elements in it, and i wouldn't recommend it to people who doesn't have the patience for such things. With that out of the way, this game excels in most of the things it sets out to. Combat can feel wonky due to the stiff animations, but with character stats, backpack management, weapon management (including repairing jammed weapons, unloading guns before throwing them away, modifying and improving them. ), psionics (think plasmids from bioshock, but more difficult to use and a much broader range of abilities), research of foreign materials and navigation via maps and signs, you'll be too busy to be bothered.Creepy atmosphere, creepy enemies and creepy political undertones.

Should you play this game?Short Answer:Yes- I’d certainly recommend it. This game is lauded as one of the greatest PC games of yesteryear for a reason- and I can see why it has afforded such lavish praise. So long as you are a fan of first person action RPGs with horror elements, as well as the admittedly familiar setting of “abandoned space ship crawling with monsters”, I would say you only stand to gain from playing this game. However, I found that there was a learning curve to surpass before I was able to fully enjoy the game (although this may differ for other people)- so be aware of that.Long Answer:Background Info:First person action/survival horror RPG, developed by Looking Glass Studios and Irrational Games. System Shock 2 is one third of the triumvirate of quintessential PC games from the past, alongside Thief: The Dark Project and Deus Ex. The game was made using the Dark Engine- a fact that I consider important and will address later on. Gameplay:The game plays out as an action RPG primarily, with the survival horror elements taking a backseat. The game controls very well- not much more to say there. Gameplay-wise, I was expecting the game to play out like Doom 3 (a game similar to SS2 in both genre and premise). I was expecting to be thrown into the game, issued an objective and I would pick up a variety of weapons throughout the game to make killing the denizens of the space ship easier on my way to the end.I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was mistaken. Instead, SS2 treated me to a huge array of action RPG options, such as a detailed and nuanced skills system, armour and an arsenal of weapons that caters to many playstyles. I was shocked to see how detailed these gameplay systems were when considering the somewhat limited setting of the game. They’re the kind of systems that I would expect to see in an open-world game such as Fallout rather than the confines of SS2’s space ship. Nevertheless, these mechanics give the game huge scope for replayability. Put briefly, there are four areas that you can spend your upgrade points on: Combat, Tech, Psi, and Stats. There is a lot on offer, especially when you consider that the Psi category has 5 whole categories of skills. This is one of the reasons for the learning curve. There’s such a huge array of choice that I felt overwhelmed at first- as I didn’t know what to upgrade in order to see everything on offer in the game (word to the wise- invest some points in hacking and research: they’re necessary to beat the game). It took me a good few restarts until I had devised a skillset that I was happy with, but when I did reach that point I had a lot of fun afterwards. Similarly, the skills system isn’t explained very well. Instead of picking your starting skills from a menu and then beginning the game; you are booted into a tutorial wherein starting skill acquisition is linked with ingame lore (Eg. Navy=Tech, Marines=Combat etc.). The whole process is longwinded, boring and individual skills are very poorly explained- which only compounds the issue of a learning curve. Final Verdict: The depth of SS2’s gameplay systems makes them the game’s greatest strength, in my opinion. However, the skill system lacks clarity- establishing a learning curve which could deter new players. I recommend perseverance- it’s worth it.Soundtrack:The soundtrack is fantastic. It matches the game’s cyber, futuristic setting and each tune is memorable. However, while the soundtrack does match the game’s setting, it does not match the game’s genre quite so much (IE the survival horror aspect). For me, the music didn’t connote an eerie, oppressive atmosphere as much as it did a fast-paced, frantic one. This is one of the reasons why I consider the game more of an action RPG than a survival horror. There is one notable exception near the end of the game though; one level where your only companion is your footsteps and the ambience of the stage. Final Verdict: The OST perfectly matches the setting, but not so much the genre. Whether or not this is a good thing is debatable, but I for one am glad that we got an enjoyable, memorable soundtrack. Story and Setting:Thankfully you don’t need to have played the original System Shock to appreciate this game’s story. The general gist of the story is that the player wakes up from cryosleep aboard the space ship known as the Von Braun to discover that it is overrun with creatures. They are then tasked with escaping by a benefactor at the other end of the communication device.  The rest of the game’s story is mostly left to the player to figure out; namely via acquiring audio logs that shed more light on the events that led up to the ship’s downfall. Thus the main body of the game’s plot is available via optional collectibles. This could have been problematic for players who don’t stray from the beaten path, but thankfully the developers have accounted for this. Specifically, exploration is essential in SS2. It’s not just encouraged- it’s necessary. Some audio logs contain codes for doors, for example. Ergo even if you’re not directly searching for further insight into the plot, you’ll probably end up finding it anyway due to the emphasis on exploration. The plot itself is adequate- not too interesting or unique; however let’s just say that the antagonist of the game is iconic for good reason. Final Verdict: Although the story itself isn’t too special, the way in which it’s presented to the player is well done. In terms of this narrative style, a close comparison would be Dark Souls (although without the ambiguity). Game Engine and Graphics:The graphics are acceptable- not very detailed but also not unpleasant to look at. As for the game engine, I find the choice of using the Dark Engine slightly questionable. After all, this engine’s biggest asset is its audio capabilities- as the player’s footsteps change depending on the surface being walked on. Thief played to this strength very well- because it was a stealth game. SS2, on the other hand, does not. You can still hear your footsteps and how they change, but this ability doesn’t factor into gameplay at all. The lack of this strength accentuates the weaknesses of the engine- such as weird character models (which makes the enemies look ridiculous and often funny instead of scary) and some muddy textures. Final Verdict: SS2 could have been more effective in most departments if it had played more to the strengths of its game engine. I question the use of the Dark Engine; however I can understand it given Looking Glass Studios’ involvement in the game (since they designed the engine themselves). Conclusion:SS2's biggest strength lies in the most important part of any game (in my opinion): the gameplay. The systems are detailed, there’s a myriad of gameplay choices and above all it’s fun. This strength supersedes all of the weaknesses for me and I strongly recommend that you play the game if only for this aspect. The soundtrack is excellent as well, and compliments the setting and fast-paced gameplay very well. The story is adequate, but presented in an interesting way. The biggest weakness for me is the poorly explained skill systems and the choice of game engine; however even these flaws weren’t enough to hinder my enjoyment overall. As soon as I passed the learning curve I enjoyed the game until the very end. Final note: if you are thinking of buying the game only for the fear factor, I wouldn’t recommend it. I wasn’t scared at all, due in most part to the ridiculous-looking enemies and utter lack of a scary atmosphere (although this is a subjective matter). Nevertheless, I whole-heartedly recommend this game and I believe it deserves the lofty praise it receives.			"

												(Disclaimer: I've spent much more time in SyS 2 but outside of Steam).Beforehand: I'm as far into the game that I just have to share my thoughts with you. I started with the vanilla version but I spent most of the time with a modded version (community patch, various texture and graphical mods). So my experience is mostly based on a patched up SyS 2.As many others, I knew Bioshock before I've heard of SyS 2. I was aware that Bioshock was heavily influenced by Sys 2, the one can be seen as the spiritual successor or the other way round SyS 2 as the predecessor.Some say that SyS 2 is the better game and I was sceptical about that because of the game's age and Bioshock's quality. Well, it's a matter of taste and I won't debate it here. (Let's finally start with the review at this point.) However what SyS 2 delivers is downright beautiful. I actually turned the new NPC models (mod) off because the original ones with high poly scare the pie out of me.This refers to my first point: -Atmosphere- The setting presented is executed in a brilliant way. Music (ambient one, not the DnB/Techno - at least for my taste) and surrounding are intertwined beautifully. Additionaly the mechanics and gameplay add to the hostile feeling and environment because you're constantly short on supplies. You are worried about every next step. This again meets with the urge to explore. The game does it right, because not only you want to explore, you also have to because of the supply shortage. And you don't feel forced to as well as you will get rewarded for your curiosity without making the game predictable.I forgot to mention the customization which goes far deeper than in e.g. Bioshock. Your character can be developed in innumerous ways - not only in terms of common classes. In sum classes and specialization are very ""fluid"". Everything makes sense in-game - it isn't just there, so you can do it but it's thought through. The way this game makes you making choices is just hard to be matched.-Realism- Some people classify this game as a ""sim fpsrpg"" and that for a reason. E.g. every weapon wears off. You can maintain, repair and modify objects. Certain weapons work on certain enemies etc. You have to know and can research your enemies weaknesses. It boils down to stats eventually but also on how you approach every single situation. Gunplay (if focused by your way of playing) itself isn't very satisfying but it serves its purpose. -AI- Well the AI has aged but it has implemented the stages of awareness you might know of the Thief titles - being suspicious, alerted, etc. It may be clunky but pathfinding works good and it strangely fits the game. It is bone-hard to beat anyway, and the AI makes it even scarier.Some final words: Of course the game has faced enough criticism as well for being clunky and overly complex but I guess the community patches have brought some extra balance and smoothed out the rough edges (graphically and figuratevly speaking). And the mod manager let's you turn mods on and off (!) in a matter of seconds which is a big advantage compared to dumb copy and paste of modded directories. Simply put, the (modding) community is great - also thanks to Looking Glass Studios.Ad Backtracking criticism: I don't consider this as a problem. As aforementioned - it makes sense and is part of the realism. Furthermore it adds to reduce linearity so often seen in games and it rewards players who can memorise stuff.Final words: SyS 2 reminds you of what a game can be and what a game can and should do right. I recommend it to everyone and plead for some patience of those who feel e.g. overwhelmed at first.Yours,B.			"

												In 1997, three Looking Glass employees left their jobs and founded Irrational Games. Their first project was to work with Looking Glass on a sequel to one of the most innovative FPS games of all time. The end result was of the most atmospheric, immersive, frightening and enjoyable games I've ever played.System Shock 2 is a thinking man's shooter, a complex RPG, a stealth game and a survival horror nightmare combined with an amazing story to tie it all together.The game is set in the year 2114, 42 years after the events of the original game and, while it helps in a few places, you do not need to have played the first game in order to fully enjoy this one.You start as a nameless soldier applying to enrol into the UNN. After 4 years of service in your chosen branch of the UNN military, you are called upon to join the crew of the Von Braun, which is about to take her maiden voyage into the furthest reaches of space. You wake up on-board, with no memory of the last few weeks, to find that the crew has been slaughtered by an unidentified force.In System Shock 2, every single bullet is crucial to your survival as you explore the open-ended environments. You will also have to think about what ammo to use against what targets, maintaining, repairing and upgrading your weapons to keep them in good condition, hacking computers, replicators and security systems and upgrading your cybernetic gear to allow you to carry more items, run faster, hit harder, hack better and take more damage. You will not be able to purchase all upgrades or master everything so choosing wisely is essential.Don't expect to be guided by the hand however, you will have to find your own way around the ship. You can and will have to revisit previous areas of the ship and any items you have left there will still be there on your return journey. Don't expect cleared out areas to remain safe however, the game will keep you on your toes by re-spawning enemies making very few areas safe for long.Talking about environments, this isn't a dark, miserable, flickery lighting infested place. This is a place where people had to live; you'll not only visit warehouses, docking areas, loading bays and shuttle bay areas but also living quarters and recreational areas, a casino, movie theatre and even a botanical garden!  There are some other amazing places too but well.. where's the fun in me telling you everything? ;)As for the story, its told in a way similar to that of the original game; you'll find audio logs around the ship made by the crew. From every day chores they had, love interests, moaning about co-workers to what is happening to them as they're recording, the logs give you a picture of what happened to them and may even help you find things hidden around the ship for your own survival.System Shock 2 is built on the same technology Thief uses, known at the Dark Engine. Because of this, the advanced character controlling and stealth mechanisms are carried over to Shock 2. You can hide in the shadows and observe enemies and their behaviour. Enemies can hear you and can be distracted by noise, they'll search the area if suspicious of your presence and will alert their allies if you are seen or manage to escape from them after a fight doesn't go as planned.For all its amazing points, the game does have some faults; some of the RPG skill branches don't make much sense, the level design at times feels rushed. The character models, even for the time, were incredibly ugly and whilst the game's story ends on a high note, the ending is a massive 'To be continued...' bombshell that may never get fully answered.This is the pinnacle of 90's PC Gaming. Games like Deus Ex and BioShock would never have been made without this and games like Borderlands, Fallout 3/New Vegas, Dishonored, Mass Effect and Dead Space all went on to borrow elements from this one game.Absolutely 100% recommended!

												So I finally got around to beating System Shock 2 and I have to say I’m impressed. Even after all these years, not unlike the original 2 Thief games, SS2 holds up quite well even by today’s standards. The story is immersive and given that this series was the precursor for the Bioshock series, there are RPG elements related to how you level your character’s attributes which actually have an impact on how the game plays out (i.e. if you increase you hack skill enough you’ll be able to instantly perform a security override without the need to actually hack anything when one of those annoying security cams sees you, granted you’ll still need to find the nearest security interface to do so... but still).The premise of the game, though not necessarily unique in the plot twist it presents, essentially has you teaming up with Shodan (the AI main baddie from SS – totally hot!) to stop the AI Xerxes (not to be confused with the bling’d-out god king from 300 – total d-bag!) controlling the vessel you’re on, among other things. There are droids, security bots, zombie droids, egg sacks, turrets, spiders, larval worm things, monkeys, monsters and mutant freaks aplenty to be found throughout the game. To combat them you can make use of a Psi device with various properties, like kinesis or a cryo blast, and there are firearms as well. However, those things aside, nothing beats the wrench that you’ll gain access to early on – just level your strength up all the way and smite thine foes into oblivion!!Sure, the graphics are a little clunky and there are a few wonky things going on with the AI in the game itself at times, but any pseudo horror/sci-fi game is worth a go and the idea of a sentient AI running amok has never been creepier than in this series that paved the way for so much else, the least of which is the now legendary Bioshock series.

												Before Ken Levene was mucking around with Bioshock, he was doing something a little more everything, in the form of the 1999 Irrational Games/Looking-Glass Classic, System Shock 2, a game held still in extreme regard and praise, with passionate fans still pumping out mods and texture updates, over 15 years later.I snagged the game for next to nothing in a Steam sale, and was set. I started a new game, figured everything out and watched a couple of videos to refresh anything I didn't understand and holy ♥♥♥♥. It's 4am, I'm 9 hours deep, completely scared out of my mind, with the mouse and keyboard sweaty as hell at this point, cans of Coke strewn across my computer desk before having to stop just after reaching Deck 5. And I'm saying to myself in my head, ""this is the best game I've ever played in my entire life"", and I truly believe that. Behind the strange UI interface and mechanics that seem archaic at first, is possibly the scariest and exhilarating games ever created. Get used to the UI and the RPG elements like the upgrade system and the cyber module thingys that seem like collecting cookies or something at first. The game I first thought was a half life tip off was now making half life look like a ♥♥♥♥ing babies toy, with the most basic gameplay and storyline you've ever seen in your life. Not only have I never been gripped by a game quite like System Shock 2 (Ocarina of Time came close), but had story and the gameplay depth that I didn't even think was possible for a game of its age. Now I've sucked enough of the games proverbial...um, laser rapier(?), now onto what makes the game so special. The Shooting: I'm starting off with the 'weakest' part of the game (which is in closed captions for obvious reasons (none of the game is bad)). Your guns can seem very underpowered, to the point were using your wrench to bludgeon an enemy to death seems more viable, but this is usually only for the first few hours of the game. Keep levelling up your standard weapons points, and your guns feel refined and realistically accurate. This, although annoying to have underpowered guns for the first few hours, makes so much sense. Your memory is completely wiped, you've forgotten almost everything about yourself, so it makes sense that you've forgotten how to use a basic firearm until you've overcome a learning curve. Everything in this game is tightly woven to have a purpose and to seem real, it's truly incredible for a game of its age. The RPG stuff: The levelling up element of this game makes KOTOR's RPG mechanics look like week old ham, and that's coming from a person who absolutely adores KOTOR. There's no hand holding here, you either figure out what's going to keep you alive and don't be too generous with your levelling up, or upgrade the stuff that's not really needed and have to start again half way through. The psi amp is something that makes the game truly replayable. In one run, you could choose to not use it at all, and in another run could use it solely. Either way, you better figure out the twidly RPG stuff like looting and log reading really quickly, because it pretty much is the game. Luckily it's done exceptionally here. The Weapons: What's more entertaining that being able to carry a machine gun, rocket launcher and weird alien gun you need to research 300 times before it can be used and a laser sword at the same time? Nothing, that's what. The weapon load out is incredible here and is another place were the game really shines. What doesn't shine (pun intended, as you'll see) is that your weapons degrade over time, which forces you to constantly repair them, which is more of something put in for realism than an actual nuicance. This is 100% believable however as you're literally fighting for your life onboard the Von Braun. Another great element. The Research thingy: Okay. Here's something that the community collectively hates. The research element. Whilst it is possible to go through the game researching only one item on deck 3 and still beat it, the research mechanic is another thing thrown on top of the chocolate and ice cream-sundae that sweetens up the experience even more. It's extremely diverse too, as some items yield you a damage upgrade on specific enemies, and others allow previously useless items to become healing materials. The thing people hate about this is that often, these  items will need chemicals to research, and you'll often find yourself being forced to backtrack several floors before finding the correct chemical. Personally I liked this, as it really drives home that you're only priority is to SURVIVE. Nothing else. And that often times requires doing such things. This mechanic also allows you to explore the game in way more depth and really get to know your way around which is absolutely crucial in this game.  Overall I really liked this element, as it's not really needed but offers up limitless replayability and exploration. The enemies: Suprisingly, for such an old game, all the enemies feel very real. Reprogrammed protocol droids infected by the evil SHODAN/Xerxes, horrible infested messes, brutally mutilated humans, sacrificed to the 'Many'. Truly terrifying stuff that chills you to the core. But, again this all feels real, and the enemies, although lacking in technical design, are absolutely terrifying in visual and sounds design, and over all, the MidWifes and the Hybrids are 2 of the best enemies ever created in video game history. The later enemies that you encounter, particularly the psi projections and the rumblers are brutally unfair at points. In the last few hours of the game especially, but that isn't really a bad thing because, hey, you've made it this far, why would the game relent now? Either way, the enemies may be brutalizing at first, but once you get to deck 5, you pretty much have the most reliable weapons in the game and are able to have a little fun with how you dispatch your hunters.The last thing to really comment on the level design and the impact the game has left on me and I'm sure countless others. The level design is absolutely impecable and by far the best from any game of it's age and even to this day it is absolutely incredible. The sheer scope and scale of some of the settings and levels are just crazy. Considering this game was made in 1999, by a team of complete amatures, it is remarkable. The 'Body of the Many' is hated by mostly everyone, however I thought it was a nice break from constant grey walls and space-stuff, even if you can get stuck on parts on the environment due to the Dark Engines fairly Lego-Like physics capabilities. Things we take for granted in modern games, like incredible interactivity (i.e, anything not nailed down WILL move/can be fiddled with) and security cameras that, if spotted by, will cause some lovely friends to come running for your flesh. Overall, the impact this game has last can simply not be understated. The amount of things that happen in this game that have triggered my mind to go ""Oh yeah, I've seen that in *another aclaimed game*"" was astounding and I think just makes you appreciate the game even more. The game is perfect in every sense of the word and I truly believe this is the Citizen Kane of gaming. So diverse and open, terrifying and dripping with atmosphere and all around just amazing. This is by far my favoutite game, as it's just so charming and playable that it's kinda annoying to think that no game since has even touched the ground that System Shock 2 trail-blazed. Once you perfect the keyboard shortcuts and perfect the use of the U.I, it becomes a truly magical experience, doing what other games lack infinitely by allowing you to really sink into the shoes of the protagonist and feel like you're experiencing the terrors of the Von Braun first hand.System Shock 2 is the best game ever made.

 Review - System Shock 2 === Rating: 9.5 / 10 - Incredible Masterpiece, both revolution and genesis of an entire gameplay style. === The Good - Stunning depth in character creation and development. Infinite possibilities for builds, to suit ANY playstyle or even role-playing experience you might want to start.- Incredibly intricate and deep level design: they don't make stuff like this anymore. You will get lost in the horror of the putrid bowels of infested spaceships, and you will be delighted of it.- A real challenge: top 2 difficulty levels are a real tough challenge even for experienced players. Very limited resources, you will have to search any corner and dark conduit to survive; also, once the stuff is gone, is gone. No magical shops, no item respawns, nothing. You are out of ammo? healthpacks? money? You die.- Open world, dynamic horror: the entire ship is explorable, and it is IMMENSE. You will have to get through the entirety of it many times to uncover all of its secrets and survive... but danger is never gone, as enemies will constantly come out of any crack, air vent and corner to hunt you down.- Enemies have very good AI for being from 1999, each has its own behaivior, some more complex than others, but all of them hurt a lot and are serious threats.- Gigantic replayability: another build means an entirely different approach to the game's combat and difficulties, another completely different experience.- Co-Op campaign: share the horror with a friend, actually a very fun experience at highest difficulties, but it takes away something from the true horror experience of being ALONE in the living hell of System Shock 2.- Tons of community made mods, patches, fixed, anything you can imagine to get only the best out of this game. Also, fan-made missions.- SHODAN is one of the most ambiguous, well crafted and intriguing characters ever crafted in gaming history.- Very good variety of items and weapons to find- Extremely well made environments, sound design and atmosphere ensure true immersion in this ludicrously horrifying experience. At its time it was 5 years ahead of anything you can think of.=== The Bad  - Co-op mode is very, very bugged. This because the developers did not fix the bugs in it as they ceased game support. Still, community patches can fix lots of problems, but some stay, you will find out by yourself eventually, my only suggesion is SAVE OFTEN and make MANY SAVE SLOTS. Still enjoyable and playable though.- Some character builds are kinda underpowered compared to others, balancing is not perfect in some things but it's no major problem and eventually skill and tactics can overcome what power cannot.- Seldom crashes in area transitioning, probably due to running on new operating systems and such.=== The Ugly Nothing to report here!=== Conclusions This game is the real deal. Masterfully crafted FPS / RPG of the highest finery. Father of an entire genre, any other game of this type is simply blown away by its sheer amount of content and the quality it is made with.As of 2016, there is no game of this same genre (like Bioshock genre) that can even come close to this level of depth, gameplay, technical realization and design.You just get it.

												Getting back to another old school game playing System Shock 2 was a really intense experience.For a 1999 title this game is beyond awesome. Setting the flag for the survival horror schifi rpg genre, SS2 is a game lots will enjoy, and few can handle without any help from walkthroughs and maybe cheats as well.Find yourself alone in a ship far away into the dead space in the middle of a chaotic hostile and evil environment. Choose your skills well. Your moves even better. Trust the machine. Scavenge. Hack. Kill. Survive.The game is scary, creepy, spooky (insert more synonyms here) and good god it's so hard. I had my ♥♥♥ handed to me by this game so many times and I had to take small breaks in order to keep my mind clear.PROSAmazing RPG elements. Gameplay that makes you think before acting. Perfect voice acting. Voice audiologs way so perfect for its time. Perfect script and story. Good graphics for its time. No major bugs. You can install mods. Environent design and scary elements that makes this game the Dead Space of 1999....on crack. Replayable due to class selection and different way to handle the fightsystem (if you got enough pills with you) CONSLots of backtracking. Difficult game to beat.Fan of the genre? Don't mind old games? You have no excuse not having this game in your library and not already downloading to play it. Totally recommended.			"

												An awesome classic game!System Shock 2 is horror or spooky RPG/FPS. You fight monsters that are transforming out of human.The story is simple but nice and has some surprises.The best of the game is the atmosphere for me! The most I liked is the cool voice editing I guess. Regulary you hear some voices in your head and these are edited quite good. The creepiness comes along with scary monsters and creepy voices. The monsters respawn randomly so you actually can never cool down. Additionally, you are alone all over.The RPG part consists of a skill system. So you can hack consolses and more but you have to have the knowledge for example.Moreover, there's a research system and for some objects you have to find chemicals. I really like that idea.Altough System Shock 2 is from 1999 it's great. It's a classic game. I really like old games. You too? Then don't wait to buy this game it's really worth it!			"

												Ignore playtime, because I've disconnected SS2 from Steam to install newest SS2tool and some mods.This game is really good. Like, unbelievably good. So much better than Bioshock and stuff - it's not even funny. Atmosphere is dense, interface is nice, gameplay is deep. Controls do feel unresponsive sometimes, but still.Also, 'buggy' coop was not buggy at all for me and my friend (with latest SS2tool, at least) - excluding couple desynchronisations between levels, but they are easily remedied by saving before changing level.And another good thing - it was quite fun in coop. Not sure if it's better than singleplayer, more like another kind of experience, but still entertaining. So, if you haven't played this game (and if you have nothing against dated graphics - but again, mods), I can easily recommend it to you. It's golden classics.			"

												System Shock 2 is gaming perfection. It sets up a fantasticaly scary atmosphere (turn the music off if you wanna be scared), amazing in depth RPG mechanics, alot of replayablility, fantastic story that does not hold you hand and the perfect enclosed setting.  The layout of the ship is completely amazing, each part of the ship has a purpose showing how much attention to detail and effort that was put into the creation of the vessle.9/10 buy this ♥♥♥♥			"

												This will be a review for people who have never played the game.Should you care about this game and why? It's over a decade old and you've got these people yammering on about how good it is, and now you might be wondering if you should bother with it or not.This is the first time I've played this game and I have to say that there is some excellence to be found here and some annoyances, just like in any good game.This is an FPS with RPG elements, with heavy emphasis on RPG. You'll want to research a bit about character creation before you start, or you could just have a go at it, if you don't mind maybe having to restart half way through.The sound design in this game is what really makes it for me. I turned the music off as soon as I started. The atmospheric sounds really hit the spot. I played with 2.1 speakers (that's two speakers and a sub) and it really worked that sub. The character logs in the game are fully voiced. You can also replay the logs and you will probably have to because sometimes you'll be walking along, listening to a log and a scripted log will come up, playing the two simultaneously, which was kind of annoying.You'll want to reconfigure the controls for a more modern set up. WSAD and all that good stuff. The game feels pretty natural after you get set up.The gameplay, coupled with the forboding machinery and sound effects, is really tense. I found myself making extensive use of the leaning keys (Q and E) in order to peek around corners to see if I could get the drop on an enemy before they got one over on me.The story, while not a direct sequel, does borrow heavily from System Shock 1. Having never played the first in the series, the story still works for me because they fill you in on the basics in the intro.The level design is, for the most part, pretty good. I didn't have to wonder or wander too much in order to figure out where I was supposed to be and exploration was rewarding. Things start getting a little weird near the end and I have to say that, while at first, I felt the game was stretching out a bit for time, it ended up making me feel like the last two or three hours were a necessary trial. BTW, there's no waypoint markers, in case you were wondering, but then what's the point of exploring if you've always got an arrrow telling you where to go??So, if you can deal with reconfiguring controls, dated graphics (there's a few texture resizing mods that are good), some old fashioned exploration without waypoints, and the last few hours feeling a little like a hail mary denouement, it is pretty good. I don't have the rose-tinted glasses to tell you that it's a cornerstone of PC gaming or that everyone who has business calling themselves a gamer should have played it, but I would say that I might actually play it again someday and that's not something I say often.

												Living classic of FPS genre, standing in one row with Half-Life but has got much more variable game mechanics. And a brutal wrench instead of crowbar.All fans of such shooters as BioShock, Dead Space, F.E.A.R. definitely should play this game 'cause without both System Shocks these games would never exists.P.S.: there's no such a charismatic antagonist in video games as a Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network (call her SHODAN). Closest cultural reference - Agent Smith from Matrix, I'd say :)			"

												Similar to the original deus ex in a lot of ways but unlike deus ex where i find certain mechanics like stealth for example a bit dated now, i always found nothing dated about system shock 2 and it still holds up very well today. It's atmosphere, level design, visual design and level of depth in its rpg mechanics is why i love this game. Great techno music during combat, great writing and a fun and creepy story. It's still an amazing game i just think that most gamers are spoiled with the hand holding in modern games and they will never be able to get into this kind of game and experience it which is sad. You have to figure out what you have to do and where you have to go by yourself. There is no magic waypoint all the time telling you where you need to go. You have to read logs to find codes for doors to progress and research specific items needed to progress using different chemicals that you have to find in the levels. You have to carefully manage your inventory and supplies throughout the whole game or you won't be able to progress. The game forces you to use your brain and you get a great sense of accomplishment when you complete a stage you have been on for hours (engineering). This game also rewards you very nicely for exploring every area of the game with items which encourages taking your time and exploring every area of the ship. This game has some of the best sound design of all time with the voice of shodan and the sounds of the ship and the music and sound effects etc. It's still honestly one of the best games ever made i would put it somewhere in my top 20 i can't really think of anything i dislike about it. 10/10 (Masterpiece)			"

												Ah man, where do I start with this game. This game is one of the greatest computer games I have ever played. From the creators of Thief, and it’s just as good. Anyway, let’s get into this.DISCLAIMER: This review will include some forms of spoilersGameplay- The gameplay is very nice; very easy to get into. Admittingly the two different forms of HUD were a little funky at first, but I quickly got use to it, and I enjoyed running in one direction away from Hybrids while trying to reload my gun with a different set of bullets. The “Cyber Modules” system was also good. Using Cyber Modules you can upgrade the player’s Stats, Weapons Skills, Psi Powers, and Tech. At the start of the game it’s easy to get into upgrading your character with the different Cyber Modules you are given or pick up throughout the Von Braun, and then as the game goes on Upgrades start costing more and more Cyber Modules to the point where each Cyber Module you receive is like the greatest thing ever, and that my friends, is how you do a Upgrade system. I never actually got into the Psi Powers, so I can’t say much on that, but of what I did it was pretty cool and snazzy.Graphics- The game was made in 1999 for Computers… So that should say something about the graphics. But the graphics aren’t horrid, they’re easy to look at, but it actually took the “Horror” aspect of the game down a bit because of how laughable some of the enemies look. There are some mods are textures you can download however to increase the quality of the textures, and those do look good so I would recommend them.Setting- As I mentioned above, the game is “Horror”. However, it is much more than just a Horror game(and as I mentioned before the graphics make it not all that scary). In the first few parts of the game you’ll come across the occasional severed limb or head. But as the game goes on they start appearing less and less until they’re just gone for good almost. In my opinion that shows that the developers weren’t trying to make a full out Horror game (of the Hollywood variety anyway). There are also a couple dead bodies hanging from the ceiling with horrific face expressions, but I only find like three of those. The main enemies in the game are Hybrids, which look like humans with a worm coming out of their chest biting onto their head, but really, it’s not all that scary. Now that I’ve covered the Horror parts of the game, it’s time to talk about how the game isn’t actually a “Horror” game. As I said before there is so much more to the game. It is definitely a Suspense game, and that it does perfectly. The game depends on the mysteries and suspense to creep you out rather than gore, which is great for the game. There are also the many Audio-logs left by the dead crew members. Many of these Logs help flesh out the history of the ship and it’s inhabitants, and all that happens before the start of the game. Some of the Logs you’ll wish you never read… Ehehehehe*Spoilerriffic stuffs start here*SHODAN is also a very important point of the game. Starting from her reveal up to the end of the game the game is at it’s best, with her constantly talking to you and prodding you along in her distorted yet adorable(I kid) voice. SHODAN’s interactions with the player are some of the best parts of the game: “I AM SHODAN”, “I-I-Insect!”, “Can’t you do anything right?!” I was actually pretty disappointed when she betrayed me, I thought me and her had something, D:*End*VERDICT- This game is great, but probably not for everyone. If you are a fan of darker games or just want to play a game that’ll scare you(DARN ROBOTS!) but not give you nightmares, play this. Also I recommend this to fans of the “Thief” series, as it is made by the same studio and shares many voices(Stephen Russel, FTW!). This game took “Sci-Fi Horror” and made something great. I would really like to see a third game someday… *looks off into the sunset*Anyway, 8.5/10! It’s a great game!ALSO: I highly recommend listening to Cryoshell’s Breakout while playing the game!

												System Shock 2 is the sequel to the criminally underrated and severely difficult System Shock. Let me just say, System Shock 2 is one of the my personal favourite games. You play as a man stranded deep in space, 6 billion lightyears deep, on the ship the Von Braun, and it has been overrun by the ship's AI, Xerxes. You are guided through his HUGE ship by Polito, another survivor, and you must work you way to the Rickenbacker, the Military ship piggy-backing on the Von Braun. This game has elements of an RPG, such as you picking a class. Hacking, Psi Skills and Weapons are the classes, and each have their good elemnets, however, you get to use all three, but the one you master in is the prominent one. Hacking is the most usefull, for you will be doing all through this game. The enemies range from ""Zombies"" to robots that have been taken over by Xerxes and even Xerxes himself. The game is a very scary game, and I mean it. It's terrifying. You also have an inventory that is pretty big and obviously very useful. It will be packed out the ♥♥♥ by the end of the game. Now, let's get to the bad stuff. First off, the layout of the Von Braun is severely huge, and will ♥♥♥♥ You Off! The enemies are very tricky and each have a certain weakness. Also, what you are supposed to be doing is very murky and difficult. You must check EVERY PIXEL OF THIS GAME! That is sooo important! Things are really hidden in this game! So, if you do play it, go back though a second time just for the story, the story is amazing. Anyway, good luck!			"

												Went in with very high expectations, and this game exceeded them. -This game is just so unique, and in a good way. Bioshock is probably the most similar any game has ever gotten to it, and I believe System Shock 2 is better.-It has aged extremely well; this game is absolutely terrifying.-Lots of replay value. -Sound design is top-notch.-Extremely in-depth story with tons of puzzle-peices to put together.-Graphics are great for the time, and while they aren't the best, the game still retains its ability to be immersive. It feels very isolated and alone.Do NOT start playing this game co-op. The atmosphere is changed completely and the experience is much scarier and hard-hitting when you are alone; try co-op once you have completed the game solo. You can only play through a game the first time once.Playing it co-op would be like if your friend told you all of the spoilers to a movie before you saw it- yeah, the movie was probably still amazing, but it probably wasn't nearly as engagin or exciting as it would be had you of gone in without prior knowledge.

												CyberPunk, FPS+RPG(ish), legend...Its just my heart is not letting me move on after a point. One of the most complete, most apetizing, most horrifying games ever made by mankind. However Im pretty sure SHODAN could ve done a much better of a job...Plot, development, gameplay, ui, enemies, weapons, the entire ship, personal Logs, any piece of information that could shed light on the dark,ominous story. Wonder why noone paid any attention to shoot a movie on this stuff, really interesting.its one of those games whose even no-commentary playthroughs are epic.If you are ok with horror-filling, chilling games, do not hesitate but its always best to check the gameplay before the purchase.not fitting for every person but for everyone, certainly...

												Playing this game for the first time was one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had (I still play it to this day and I am glad the game is on Steam).  The gameplay is excellent, and the story, music, and atmosphere are all amazing.  Bioshock's ancestor.  A classic.  10/10I haven't even played the game with mods (I personally don't mind the dated visuals); that being said I have only heard and seen good things about some of the popular mods available for this game, which are definately worth a look also.  Compared to its contemporaries, System Shock 2 doesn't have the best visuals, but there is a certain charm to it still.			"

												Finally started playing this gem. The game has aged surprisingly well and retained its scary ambience. A major factor that makes this possible is the sound design that most of the time makes aware that you are not alone (and when it doesn't it is equally scary). Good headphones are recommended for the game.I play the game on Linux. Steam has linux version of the game, but as far as I'm aware, that is only a Wine wrapper and atleast I had some problems with constant clicking sound.

												System Shock 2 is pretty cool, I guess. I write this review on my own will and totally not because I see the gleam of a rifle scope from a very irate group member in the distance.It's hard to actually talk about SS2 because the game came out in 1997 before Ken Levine drank the Kool-aid. Everything that could be said about SS2 has already been said, but I'll be damned if I don't try.You play as a soldier I call Goggles because his actual designation has too many numbers in it. Goggles wakes up from cryo sleep aboard the Van Braun, one of Earth's first endeavors into FTL travel. Or as my friend likes to call it: The USS Chimp-wagon. The Chimp-wagon is also escorted by the Rickenbacker, a military vessel who's crew will totally help you. Totally. Unfortunately, when you wake up upon the Chimp-wagon, everything's gone to hell and the ship has been taken over by a very polite A.I, humans possessed by alien worms, and robots that like to explode and hurt me and my feelings.But like I said before, there isn't anything I can actually add on to System Shock 2's review narrative since everything has already been said, so I'm going to just tip toe around it and add my own personal experience.The graphics aren't bad, especially for the time, but a lot of things look like mud. I was informed a little too late that there was a texture pack, but by then I had already beaten the game. That's all I will say about the graphics, I guess.The game itself kicked my ♥♥♥, I wasn't expecting it to be the ball buster it was. It's not that the game itself is overly hard or anything, it just expected a certain amount of competency I'm not use to giving, especially with all the modern games I play. Gremlin Rock 2 is hailed as one of the scariest games of all time, something which rolls off me no problem because I'm super brave. But in all seriousness, SS2 didn't really do much to scare me, but that's not to say that I wasn't uneasy. There's this sense of dread that permeates in every nook and cranny the game has. Once I turned the music off, all that was there to keep me company was the rumbling of the Chimp-wagon and the sounds of alien possessed monster men talking to themselves or looking for me. The hybrids, or as I like to call them, wormy guys, are the most numerous enemies in the game. These are humans that have had their minds taken over by alien worms and formed into a collective called “the many”. The wormy guys travel around the Chimp-wagon looking for non-wormy humans to wormify so that they can all think the same, do the same, talk the same, and share the same beliefs and goals.SO basically it's Facebook but with less overall murders. Other than the wormy guys, there are suicide bots, giant angry battle robots, annoying spiders that rush you down, and who could forget: pudding given life. If I have any complaints about Hamster Frock 2 it's that it kind of drags on a little bit too much after the big spoiler reveal that everyone already knows so I won't even bother spoiling the spoiler. It sends you out on errands to do a bunch of objectives that add up into infiltrating the Many's giant poop dungeon. But even though the fetch quest was kind of boring, it kind of showed off Painting Smocks greatest strength, which is it's level design. The Chimp-wagon is built like an actual space ship instead of a series of levels for you to traverse. You can go back to anywhere on the ship at any time, which is neat for scavenging or leveling reasons.I spent more than enough time trying to find an area to level up and upgrade my stats until I realized that I could just go back to Engineering and set up there, it kind of turned engineering into my home base before I went out to get my head smashed in while my assailant tells me to run and begs for euthanasia. So basically like living in Detroit. But should you play System Shock 2?You already have, but I guess you should. It will kick you out of the modern game mindset really quickly if you hope to get through the game in one peace. The game's graphics haven't aged all that well considering there isn't even a muzzle flash on your fire arms. But graphics aren't everything and the game makes up for it with a heaping bowl of atmosphere and the mandatory sci-fi horror poop dungeon near the end.Girly Socks 2 gets 4 flat-faced men with goggles out of 5.Seriously, whats with sci fi games and ending in poop dungeons?

												I adore this game, simple as that.  I'm a big Sci-Fi dork, and this game easily takes place in my top 3If you like any sci-fi horror game that's come out in the past 10 years, it probably had influences from System Shock 2. It's not sleak at all compared to recent games, but nonetheless just as immersive when it comes to exploration and combat. The retro style may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I suggest playing for yourself to really get a feel for it.It's on sale for a steal, but even full price is beyond worth it, especially with System Shock being re-released.

												I have never played System Shock 2 and it was one of those games that had been looming over my head ever since I bought it a couple of years ago. I have played most of the ""cult and classic"" old school RPG's (Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment etc) in the past few years given how I didn't have a PC back in the day that these were released and I have finally managed to get some time to play the game that inspired the Bioshock series (which I love).Little did I found out that this was an amazing experience to have even after 18 years since it's release. This is a true survival horror first person RPG with a lot of atmosphere, depth and amazing writing and it is a MUST PLAY.			"

												System Shock 2 is a first person role-playing horror game.  It mixes action adventure and survival horror elements. I could compare gameplay somewhat similar to Deus Ex.  System shock 2 was designed by Ken Levine and co-developed by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. It was released in 1999. Some aspects have not aged well but I HIGHLY recommend that you give this game a chance.To start off, this is challenging game to review in 2016. System shock 2 is nearly as old as me. The graphics are very outdated, the hitboxes of enemies are really wonky, and there is an absurd amount of backtracking. However, mods can easily fix the old textures and make this game more appealing for “first timers”. I played with a wide range of texture mods to make it easier on my eyes. If you can get past the few setbacks this game is absolutely incredible! This is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. The atmosphere and characters are designed so well. Its blend of FPS and RPG gameplay, as well as its organic storytelling, is hard to find in most games today.  Also, this game is challenging. It does not hold your hand. It shows you how easy games are nowadays.  Not to mention, this game is extremely similar to BioShock. As some may know, Bioshock is said to be the spiritual successor of System Shock 2. That is clearly the case. Many components of System Shock 2 are the exact same in BioShock. For example: the wrench, the psi powers, the upgrade machines, and even some pieces of the story. In my opinion BioShock is just a watered down version of System Shock 2. Literally, its really watered down. Like underwater...(sorry about my bad puns).SCORE:10/10Would be called an “insect” again!			"

												System Shock 2 is an interesting game. A lot of people (like myself) first go into this game after playing the Bioshock series, expecting something similar to it with a lot of shooting action. When I first played this game, I absolutely despised it. I hated the combat, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t difficulty, the immersion breaking techno loops, and other minor annoyances that added up to me really disliking the game. However, after replaying the game for the 5th or 6th time (which I did after beating the older Thief games), the whole experience for me kinda clicked. I knew what stats were useless and which ones were needed, so I upgraded them in advance to prepair myself for what was to come. Doing so actually made the experience a lot more enjoyable than it was before, infact, I actually kinda like the game now. It's also worth noting that there are some pretty awesome fan missions out there, most notably being System Shock Infinite, which redisigns the game in certian aspects, and is overall pretty enjoyable, even if most of the game is stock System Shock 2. But you're probably wondering what I originally didn't like about the game, and that's mostly due to the fact that this game is punishing if you don't know what the hell you are doing. It took me 5-6 playthroughs to even finish, let alone enjoy the game. And while I'm on that subject, the ending (without spoiling anything) is complete garbage, and didn't make me feel accomplished for the journy I went through. It didn't help that the last few levels aren't that great either, I mean, they're not Half Life Zen level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but they aren't good either. This is also a game with a pretty slow start, which may turn off a lot of newcomers, especially if you hate slow starts. Now massive flaws like these aren't the blessings of a masterpiece, and that was something that has, and still does bother me. This game is NOT a masterpiece, in any form, but it definetelly isn't complete garbage either. System Shock 2 is more akin to a Cult-Classic, than a Magnum-Opis, and if you go into this game expecting a masterpiece, then I'm afraid to say that you may be a bit dissapointed. It's hard for me to reccomend this game, but I can reccomend it overall, so long as you go into it with an open mind, and I wouldn't hesistate that much to look up a walkthrough if you're getting stuck. I would strongly advise playing through the first 2 Theif games first, as they will kinda teach you how The Dark Engine (the game's engine) works, to an extent that even System Shock 2 fails to tell the player. That and they'll help you become much more patient, which you're going to need when playing this game. Once you're done taffing around with those 2 games, then System Shock 2 will give you a really awesome journy to behold, Insect.			"

 Positive + Perfectly combines both RPG elements and shooting mechanics, with even some survival-horror elements which add to the game greatly+ The well-crafted story doesn’t rely on cheap jump scares and the like to scare you, instead relying on hostile and frightening enemies with creepy environments to make your trek through the game terrifying to say the least+ The sound design as well only adds to the atmosphere, with enemy groans and whispers of deceased crew members echoing throughout the haunted corridors+ Memorable antagonist, which has inspired other characters (most notably GLaDOS from the Portal series) in videogames, and has a looming presence throughout the campaign+ Approximately 10 hours of game time (on Normal difficulty), with a good amount of replay value if you want to experience playing the game using the variety of playstyles available. Negative - The games interface involves a somewhat steep learning curve, the map system especially is relatively poor (unfortunately a product of the time), as they are essentially static images- Some irritating and difficult enemies to defeat; while the shooting mechanics are well-done, they’re not exactly on-par with similar first-person shooters from the same era. Worth Mentioning • While the game is dated graphically, the community has done a good job of creating mods and texture packs in order to improve the graphical quality of the game (among other things), ensuring that even if graphics are a high priority to you in videogames, installing mods will hopefully negate that issue with the game. Verdict “Long before Bioshock (and Deus Ex to a small extent), there was System Shock 2. This game is the definition of classic, and still to this day stands the test of time as a truly great game. I’d wholly recommend this game to any fan of 90s shooters and RPGS alike.” 9/10 TJBs  "

												Honestly there might not be a more chilling game experence then hacking into system only to hear the door next you open and suddenly you only hear the door open quickly followed by a twisted ""Run"" leaving you with only a couple of seconds to leave the terminal and react to this twisted create that's infront of you before he can beat your face in.Also nothing quite matches the feeling of terror as you're running as fast as you can from a robot that's speaking to you like it's trying to help you but you know for a fact that the moment you turn around to confront it you'll be blown away to kindom come. This game does atmosphere like no other (as long as you turn off the texno music) and this game is feel with tons of (mostly) well voice audio logs that do nothing but help build this world and it's atmosphere with it's steller writing and tone setting. What may seem like a drawback with the fact that the graphic's haven''t aged very well has only added to the alien and the horror of some of the creatures in this game and the alien feeling of everything and everyone in this game. This game is a must play for people who like rpgs and a must have for anyone who enjoys scifi or horror.			"

												If there's ever been a stealth company, it's Looking Glass. While other companies come and go claiming themselves to be this month's master of the first-person shooter, Looking Glass spends their time quietly taking the genre to places it's never been before. Perhaps even more amazing is the fact that they manage to set the industry on its ear again and again with startling consistency. With Ultima Underworld and its sequel Ultima Underworld 2, the company took on the daunting task of infusing the depth of an RPG into a first person engine. With the original System Shock, the team created an action game that actually made you feel like you were in a sci-fi movie. With Terra Nova, the developers tackled squad based combat from a first person point of view and succeeded wildly ¿ years before Tribes was even thought about. More recently, the company offered up Thief: The Dark Project, an amazingly deep title that introduced first-person fans to a world in which each enemy was a potentially lethal threat. Each one of these games took a completely new approach to the shoot-everything-in-sight feel of most first-person shooters and instead created a world in which you actually felt as if you were the protagonist. Now, silently, the company has done it again. Their latest foray into the first-person shooter world, System Shock 2, is an amazingly well crafted example of the genre that combines raw action with horror and suspense to deliver a gameplay experience that is very different from anything else on the shelves. It's funny, usually with a really good game, it takes an enormous amount of time to explain just what it is about the title that sets it apart. With System Shock 2 it can be summed up in a single word ¿ atmosphere. This game creates an incredibly rich game world for you to explore and conquer by offering up flawless graphics, great voice acting, interesting and frightening enemies, and a powerful storyline that meshes seamlessly with the play experience. All of these factors are important on an individual basis but more importantly, they all contribute to the dark, oppressive and often terrifying feel of the game as well. Because of this, while it's easy to sum up what makes System Shock 2 great, it's still very important to take a closer look at how each piece of the game excels and how it fits into the greater whole. Let's start with the storyline. System Shock 2 takes place in the same game world as the original title, a universe in which the Earth has already reached out and colonized the solar system. Since the out-of-control AI, SHODAN, has been stopped (in the original System Shock this thinking computer went crazy and killed a large number of people on board a the Citadel Space Station) the governments of Earth have come together in the form of a new entity titled the UNN (United National Nominate) and have lashed out at the megacorporations (specifically the largest, the TriOptimum Corporation who was responsible for SHODAN's creation) that have held power for so long. The power struggle has resulted in an uneasy truce in which the UNN still holds power officially and the corporations still hold a great deal of de facto power through their very own armies and police forces. Into this already dangerous struggle comes a new source of tension. A new ship, the Von Braun, is being built that uses a new engine developed by a Nobel scientist that will make the craft capable of faster than light travel. The new craft, which is being built by TriOptimum (despite all efforts by the UNN to keep the company uninvolved), is scheduled to make a maiden voyage that will take it to a far away solar system. Along with the Von Braun will be a security ship, the Rickenbacker, which is designed to 'piggyback' the larger ship in order to take advantage of its FTL engines. As with most new technologies, the Von Braun doesn't really work as well as it should. Hackers on board the ship have managed to screw up a lot of little things, but some of the major items don't work simply because they haven't been properly tested. One of the problems of greatest concern is that the ship's central computer, XERXES, seems to be all kinds of buggy. Worst of all, the crew, which is made up of both UNN and TriOptimum appointees, is starting to separate into two factions that mistrust and hate the others. As the game begins, the ship receives fragments of a transmission that originates at the Tau Ceti system, far outside the area of explored space. You are assigned to the ship as it begins its journey to find out what is sending that signal, and if possible to make contact with them. Once the game starts, things really get cooking. You've been kept in cold storage for the journey and awake to the not so dulcet commands of Dr. Janice Polito, the Senior Systems Analyst onboard the Von Braun. Although she's not very clear, it's obvious that the ship is in some kind of serious trouble and it's up to you to sort out what it is. As you travel around the corridors of the ship, you'll have three ways to learn more about the situation. First, you'll occasionally get messages on your PDA from Dr. Polito telling you about things that have just happened and giving you advice on what you must do next. Second, you'll find small disks scattered around the ship that hold the log messages of the crew. As you pick up and read these logs, the story will slowly unfold in front of you and you'll also get more information on how best to proceed. Finally, and perhaps most disturbingly, the cybernetic system that's been installed in you seems to accidentally pick up strong psychic signals much as a bad portable phone picks up the radio. When your system comes in contact with these emanations it will try and interpret them as light and sound. The end result is that occasionally, as you walk through the ship, you will see 'ghosts' of people who lived on the Von Braun. This is really creepy and may cause you to shoot at the images before you realize exactly what they are. Using these clues, you must figure out what happened to the crew of the Von Braun, who's managed to survive it, and how you're going to go about stopping the menace. While I'd love to go further into the storyline, there's no way to do so without totally spoiling the game. One thing I can tell you is that whatever has taken over the ship has found a way to infect the crew and turn them into horrible zombies. A lot more resilient and intelligent than your run of the mill 'a comet flew over and I was raised from my grave' undead, these vile creatures are smart enough to use complex weaponry, respond to security alarms, and to, after a fashion, speak. Other creatures you'll run into include giant spiders made up of a weird bio-material, cybernetic nursemaids and stealthy cyber-assassins.Okay, there's a lot of other things I'd like to say about this game, but I think you've probably got the basic idea by now. The one warning that I would offer up is to hard-core action fans who may be put off by the RPG elements that make this game what it is. In the end though, I would recommend this title for just about anyone who's over the age of 16 (this game is really scary) and who likes deep rich play adventures.			"

												One of the most hallowed, respected and enormously influential computer games in history, System Shock 2 does without doubt deserve such an accolade, though it is not an undertaking for the fainthearted for a number of reasons.Before outlining the frustrations which can be inherent playing this, firstly, let us extol its virtues. The back-story of a spacecraft whose crew have all mysteriously been violently killed has intriguing depth and immersive appeal, especially important for a role-playing game. Giving the player choices of which particular skills to require before the game-proper actually begins, does indeed give one the feeling that you are forming the player character out of your own choices and decisions and this further increases one's emotional involvement.As you slowly begin to explore the craft and pick up clues as to what has caused such havoc, the tension is palpable. From emails and voice recordings which you discover as you journey onwards, a sense of an actual place which was once full of living, breathing humans definitely starts to take shape. In addition to these manifold good points, the graphics themselves still look great even 15 years after the game was made.However, there are more than a few droplets of vinegar mixed in with the Ambrosial honey.Primarily, the main drawback, or perhaps a kinder word might be ;challenge', to System Shock 2 is the often bewildering complexity of elements at your player-characters disposal. In order to make intelligent progress, akin to how one might actually behave in such a real-life situation itself, the player has to juggle a veritable myriad of game-world stimuli. Emails, personal data assistants, logs on computers, notes and letters found on bodies, a constant stream of voice-messages in your character's earpiece, and much more of the detritus of exploring the seemingly dead spaceship, constantly seems to bombard the player until at times one can feel at a loss as to what to take note of and what to ignore. Perhaps this can be seen as part of the character's real-life predicament, but if the designers had taken the trouble to give more structure and order to the bombardment of information thrown at the player throughout it could have led to a less confusing and more enjoyable gaming experience. On the other hand, maybe I'm just a bit slow at times, or too methodical and tidy in my own personal way of dealing with tasks so I do hold my hand up and offer that as an explanation to the above constructive criticism.Even so, I have heard from several other sources of note, such as some seasoned gamers and highly respected gaming press, that System Shock 2 involved far too much traipsing back and forward through similar-looking corridors in search of a vital key or door-code or something of the like, without which further progress was not possible. Yet, for the gamer, completing these tasks became distinctly arduous, often extremely monotonous and frankly, unpleasantly exhausting. Elongating the play-time of a game in such a manner is frowned upon these days and for good reason.However, these constructive criticisms are as nothing compared to the monumental depth, complexity, tension and intrigue of this computer game behemoth, which also includes one of the most legendary and infamous end-of-game bosses in the annals of video-gaming.To play this game is not just to steep oneself in an immersive, tense and believablely frightening world, but it is to experience a piece of computer-gaming history.

												This definitely goes up there as one of the most entertaining games that's leagues ahead of its time through its upgrade and PSY systems, and in great level design that'll just make you feel uneasy. Delightfully uneasy. The voice acting is top notch, even though I felt like there was too much telling instead of showing. I thoroughly enjoyed how questionable aged the graphics are, but there are heaps of mods out there that soften the blow. A dude even did co-op, imagine that. Not going to lie, nabeel just killed it in his review. Just read it. It was so easy to overlook all of the things the game was ahead of its time in (i.e. audio logs, diaries, intuitive HUD & control scheme). It's a masterpiece that's worth getting, and re-buying for the inevitable remastery.			"

												Juegazo en toda regla. Es cierto que tiene muchos puntos parecidos a bioshock, pero hay un abismo de jugabilidad entre uno y otro. Este es difícil, inmersivo, tienes muchas formas de plantearte el juego, como marine disparando con armas de fuego, utilizando psi, hackeando ordenadores... todo ello te da una libertad para elegir lo que te puede llevar a una mala partida si no eliges sabiamente en que subir. Lo recomiendo en imposible, aunque reconozco que la parte final se vuelve muy complicada. Es un FPS de vieja escuela, que huye de las FPS actuales simplones en loa que solo tiwenes que apretar el botón de disparo y todo va rodado.			"

												It is an  RPG seen from first person view.You might want to stay away from that quicksave button because I think it breaks the game experience by giving you the chance to have everything in your favour. Try beating the game with only autosaves. I played on hard difficulty with constant quicksaves, finished the game with more than 1500 nanites (the currency in this game) and over 40 med hypo.You can play the game anyway you want with numerous different builds you can try. You can be an all melee character, a psi warrior or a boring soldier wielding common standard guns. Always remember that the wrench is you friend, and it is year 2114 - not knowing some hacking is almost the same as being illiterate.The enemy AI is in consistent. Sometimes they see you, sometimes they don't (maybe because I was in the shadow?). My biggest gripe in this game is sometimes there's just too many people talking at the same time: there's Xerxes with it's security annoucement, an incoming mail, the soundtrack playing and the hybrid babbling.After more than a decade System Shock 2 is still great.

												A ""cult classic"" that I missed the first time around. I found System Shock 2 to be a DEEPLY FLAWED game: The geometry of the levels is very sticky and will ""grab"" you unexpectedly; things like desks and destroyed enemies in narrow hallways serve as their own obstacles and I found myself frozen in place unexpectedly a LOT At higher levels of AGI your character becomes slippery and platforming becomes difficult The final zones (even from the Rickenbacker onward) become incredibly cramped, confusing and difficult to navigate The semi-final boss spawns so many enemies so rapidly you can actually plug doorways with corpses and have to leave a distance to discard the corpses Difficulty is very front-loaded; while this is good to make you feel like a super-enhanced killing machine toward the end of the game, it will make the beginning even more frustrating, especially while trying to learn the myriad systems Melee weapon hit detection is incredibly awkward and lagged Even with the map, emails and notes, figuring out where to go takes a while. It's interesting that it doesn't hold your hand whatsoever, but enemies spawn infinitely throughout the game and you can't pause while looking at notes/maps so you get attacked regularly while trying to figure out where to goAnd yet, I have to recommend the game. Why? I still had fun with it. Despite the myriad annoyances and frustrations, when it wasn't being an unpolished, irritating bugger it was quite a lot of fun. The beginning and ending were gross, but the middle was sweet enough to make the journey worthwhile.			"

												Was a juggernaut of game design and was at the forefront of what was deemed possible for videogames, much like half life.The narrative is told superbly through a combination of cinematics, voice overs, cyberghosts, space journal entries and the environments themselves. The sound design is top-notch, the voice of the malevolent SHODAN being the greatest example.A thick sense of foreboding permeates through the entire game, and body horror is used to good effect. It boasts a full inventory system, upgrade and stats systems, cybernetic implants, psionic powers and weapon modding, making it quite an elaborate game for the time of its release.The combat is kind of clunky, but is servicable enough (if it had gunplay and A.I. as good as half-life that came out a year before, it would be pretty much perfect)			"

												System Shock 2 is an easy game to describe generally but a hard one to pin down exactly. In simple terms you can say that it's similar to its contemporary Deus Ex or its successor Bioshock, but I'd say that it's an experience entirely of its own. The main reason for this is that it's gosh dang scary. The logs and character writing give the creepiness depth, but I can't give enough credit to how much atmosphere the game derives from enemies and graphics that by today's standards shouldn't be enough for much more than a jump scare. Instead, even when the hybrids become easy to kill (one of the few flaws is the lack of enemy variety), their appearance and quavering sounds as they approach get me paranoid every time. The player progression is also far deeper than that of the Bioshock games even if it lacks the same in-universe hook to its upgrade system that Bioshock had in the Little Sisters. Overall, System Shock 2 holds up incredibly well as a game that makes being deeper than Bioshock and scarier than Dead Space seem completely effortless. 9/10on second thought the hacking in this game doesnt have those BS pipes so 10/10			"

												I'm researching a unresearched object so I have plenty time to give some feedback (should have installed a mod to let that happen faster though)Back in the day when this game came out I was too young to properly understand the mechanics and gameplay. It's almost 15 years later and i'm all grown up and I have too say it's still damn fine playable albeit with some .cfg modifications, sstool and some mods to fix interface at high resolution. It works like a charm @ 2048x1152The game mechanics where far beyond it's time, that's why after 15 years SS2 stills holds up pretty well. If you don't mind the dated graphics (and you shouldn't moederneuker!), play this game! seriously, buy it as soon as it's in the steamsales @75% discount!  In my 20+ years of gaming this game most def. ends up in my top 10 pc games.  "

												Is this game the best game in existence?  Heck no.  Is it really, really good though?  It is very much so.  System Shock 2 is an action-rpg with an emphasis on the rpg element.  At first, you'll be very weak with nothing but a wrench, maybe two medical hypos, and a acute fear response to every sound that occurs in the game.  However, System Shock 2's greatest strength is it's depth.  There are tons of items, weapons, and psionic abilities for you to choose from.  The rpg element adds greatly to supporting different builds and playstyles.  Numerous audio logs and emails can be found throughout the game allowing you to piece together the story of what happened to the ship and even use the dead's words to progress through the game.  Not to mention, each item has a description you can spend hours reading describing the item or even giving a little corporate humor.  Sure at first the game can be difficult forcing you to save often and carefully plan your moves, but if you play smartly and allocate your upgrade points appropriately, you can literally become an invisible, flaming, inhumanely strong, lightning fast, psionic ninja that can, I kid you not, two hit every single standard enemy in the game with a hunk of crystal.  You see, I made the mistake of picking a psionic character for my first playthrough, cause you know, FREAKING PSIONICS and choosing to play on hard mode.  You can, however, choose the run and gun marine or the sneaky hacking sailor or whatever combination of the three playstyles.  This isn't to say that System Shock 2 is perfect.  Projectile weapons degrade like wet toilet paper (the primary reason why I only used melee weapons which don't degrade), certain items and abilities clearly weren't balanced appropriately (the crystal shard is actually bugged so it does more than double damage with the smasher perk and the regeneration psionic ability basically makes psi hypos far more valuable than medical hypos), the sensual stimulation units later in the game are broken (reeeeal missed opportunity there (by the way if you don't get that that was a joke, please leave now)), and the heavy weapons, besides the fantastic grenade launcher, are useless or underused.  Still, System Shock 2 is an excellent game and I'm honestly suprised I don't see more people playing or discussing it.  Maybe I've just been to the wrong communities or forums or something, but regardless, System Shock 2 is well worth your time.			"

												Still, HANDS DOWN, one of the BEST and CREEPIEST games EVER.I still got goosebumps playing this game. The atmosphere, the story, the difficulty... all of it culminates together to create an experience that makes you afraid to get into combat, the enemy is truly dangerous, and you feel small compared to the power the enemy wields. I will never put this game down for good. Okay, now that the worship is over.The ControlsThis game came out in 1999, 15 years ago. That being said, the default controls are a little out-of-date, but once you change them to a more modern FPS format (A and D strafe instead of turn, maybe use R for interaction because the lean on Q and E are very useful), it is much more comfortable. Mantling is something I had never seen before in a game, and it's popular now, but this is the first game I had ever seen it in. (long time a go folks!)The StoryWho doesn't want to find out what is going on? Everything has gone to hell and you are confused, alone, and know nothing. The perfect place to start. Even as you progress, the elements of the story are told from the perspectives of so many others,  creating a world much like a book would. Story after story unfolds before you, each one telling a small piece of what is happening to you. You never quite have all the pieces, and the mystery grows and grows until the end...The RPG ElementsEveryone likes RPG Elements in good games like this. Getting to make your own choices, living with those choices, and adapting to them is what an RPG is about. Each choice you make feels significant, and as the game progresses, you succeed or fail by the decisions you make.The DifficultyI would have to say that the game is incredibly difficult if you are unprepared. The game forces you to play smart, to look around corners, to conserve your resources whenever possible, to take your time... This is a good thing, because it gives the game a feeling that you are always in danger, and without the difficulty it wouldn't be as frightening. This is an aspect of games that has been lost over the years... and now many games, even on the most difficult setting, is not too difficult. I've yet to try and beat this beast on Impossible... Kudos to any masters who have done it.The GraphicsThe Graphics are from 1999. The textures are ancient. Yes. We know this. Go Download SHTUP and follow the instructions to update your textures if it's that big a deal. For the time, they were pretty darn good. JUST BUY ITYOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED			"

												A real classic.Despite it's age, System Shock 2 is still a thoroughly enjoyable game, with mechanics which are still seen nowadays, especially in its spiritual sequels, the Bioshock series. Although the graphics haven't aged well, the game still plays smoothly, and the story is interesting enough to make most people invested in it. The gameplay isn't even a little bit clunky, and works perfectly regardless of your playstyle.Recommended to people who enjoy sci-fi settings, action RPGs and classic games.			"

												Note: Before I even start, let me mention that if you aren't a fan of the outdated control scheme, then there's an option in the game to rebind the keys to that of a modern fps. You don't even have to rebind them yourself, just check the saved key bindings; there's a layout there already. I hear a lot of complaints about the controls, and frankly they're so easy to change that it really shouldnt be an issue. Alright, on to the actual review.System Shock 2 is generally known as an FPS/RPG hybrid, when in reality it's far more Survival/RPG. What few fps elements there are aren't particularly interesting. Headshots and the locations wherein you shoot an enemy make no difference to damage and the enemy placement outside of scripted events is very random, so if you're looking for something akin to Quake or Doom then you'll probably have better luck elsewhere. What System Shock 2 gets right is the RPG and Survival elements, which complement each other perfectly. You see, you don't get experience via killing enemies in this game, instead the game's equivalent of XP is collected through exploring the environment and searching for pickups called 'cybernetic modules'. Want that extra point in strength?  Well then you're going to have to bite the bullet and search that dark, scary room. Need another point in weapons to wield the assault rifle? Guess you're going to have to poke around that creepy corridor you've been avoiding. It's a great risk/reward   system that makes exploring all the more satisfying. There's nothing like finding a cybernetic module the developers snuck in between a pair of crates or stashed on a corpse. With such an intense atmosphere, everylittle victory feels like a conquest.And the atmosphere is brilliant, providing you turn off that weird techno soundtrack, of course. The sound design for this game is marvelous. The heavy clank of your footsteps, the far off voices of Hybrids begging for death, the scrambled, mechanial screams of a Cyborg Midwife  as she dies, it's all very immersive stuff. Just do yourself a favour and turn the music off. The game isn't without its faults, though. For example:-First time players might make some slip-ups with their levelling and put all the points into something stupid like Research, Agility or repair. There are a lot of skills in System Shock 2 that are sort of useless, so I'd reccomend looking up a few tips before starting. -Little wizard monkeys are a reccuring enemy in this game. No joke. It's sort of jarring to be fighting some horrific monstrosity one moment only to be going toe-to-toe with a fireball-throwing mokey the next.-Dying isn't much of an issue, as you just respawn at a reconstruction chamber as soon as you bite the dust. It takes away some of the tension.-It's ugly. There's no denying it. System Shock 2 is an ugly game. The polygon count is low, all the character models look like origami and looking out of a window into space is like staring at a pixelated screensaver. It's ugly. -And finally, you might have some trouble running it. I never ran into any issues, but it's an old game and I've heard some complaints. Just a warning. Overall I'd say that System Shock 2 still holds up today as an impressive RPG, and is worth your time as long as you're okay with resource managment and character development that requires you to have a specific type of character in mind from the start.

												System Shock 2 is surprisingly powerful for a game for its age, everything from the atmosphere to the story to the audio is just chilling and fills your body with fear, the game dosn't need fancy graphics to scare the player, most of the horror comes from disturbing dialogue that comes in the format of audio logs, which explain a lot of the events going on. The enemies you face are pretty scary as well, one of my favorites is the hybrid with its unforgetable quotes which also reveal the events going on. The atmosphere is just, words cant explain the frighting tone of the environments, just watch the trailer to see what I mean. I could right a novel on why System Shock 2 is such an amazing powerful game but I'll just end it hear, the game is really one of the best games of the 90s, My only complaint is that the ending, with out spoiling anything just dosn't live up to the hype the game was building up to, but overall9.5/10			"

												This is an essential game for anyone who wants to learn their roots.  Often considered ahead of its time, System Shock 2 is a great FPS/RPG with a great horror/sci-fi setting, and is one of the few survival horror games that gives an actual sense of survival with very limited ammunition and healing supplies.  It set the bar for story telling and atmosphere in a way that few games since have matched.  If it can be said to have any flaw, it would be its dated graphics, but even those aged fairly well when compared to other games of the time.  Over-all, this is just a fantastic game.			"

The creation of Intelligent AI was also one of them.You, the hacker must unravel the mystery of the ship, the Von Braun which had been taken over by a strange presence in the ship which had caused the slaughter of 1000s of crewmembers on-board.At first glance, I knew this game was something a little more complicated then your average shooter, by no means is this a 'Doom' or 'Quake' or even halflife game. Its something deeper. The addition of RPG elements much like Deus Ex adds a bit more depth upon choosing 3 distict paths in the game. The marines, The Navi and The OSA.Each class will determine the way you will pass each challenge throughout the game. By choosing the navi, you have more technical abilities then the others. You are able to disable cameras and turrets from a security terminal to remain undetected as you advance through each stage.If you were to take the OSA approach, which focuses on your 'Psi' powers (doing things with your mind), you are able to possibly go invisible, disable a camera or turret, or just use a blast of cryo energy.if you were the marines perhaps, you could get your hands on an arsenal of different weaponary ranging from laser pistols to fully fledged alien assault rifles and even grenade launchers! using your leaning ability you can shoot around corners with out getting hit (but the game cheats sometimes and you can get hit through a wall).With all these in mind, you are not resticted to your class qualities alone. you can spend your cyber modules on skills from the other classes and not feel guilty either. Although the impulse is to go for a Jack of all trades approach, its best to stay loyal to the chosen path.The games difficulty is an interesting aspect of the game. You will be underpowered, and you will be killed faster then your pc rig can play pong. the vunerablility of the player gives a sense of danger, what could possibly be around the corner, or what could possibliy bring me to an end? thats the intention. The game wants you to pay attention to its surrounding, where one wrong move could mean your life, or slow you down from progressing. The atmosphere of the game is astounding! It has that Half life and dead space feel to it, but darker and scarier. the corridors have mutant crewmembers, rouge cyborgs and even (monkeys?) ready to snap you in half. And even as you progress further through the game you are constantly Taunted by SHODAN (the antagonist) as if you were just a mere bug. nothing encourages you as you progress, but you feel the reward of going against that.The audio logs of crewmembers found throughout the ship helps the player to understand what has happened to them or the events in a personal manner. You are sunken into the mystery of what happened to the crew member as you find audio log after the other, just like chapters in a book. I absolutley love when developers give characters more depth through audio logs or written passages.The music and all dont always give the atmospheric vibe you should expect from a game of this caliber, but sometimes, silence is the best kind of music.In all, I was satisfied with the ending of the game and the twists and turns inbetween, and for any of those wondering whether to buy this or not, i reckon its a worthy investment of your time and money.

												Shockingly goodDespite being a 16-year-old game SYSTEM SHOCK 2 has a lot to offer. Yes the graphics look very dated when compared to today’s games but they can be improved by the mod packs readily available online. And it’s really only the visual differences that set this game aside from contemporary titles. It’s immediately obvious that SS2 is the progenitor of the excellent Bioshock series. There’s a strong storyline backed by first-rate voice acting. The combat is okay given the game’s age, and the RPG elements are convincing. Personally, I’m not a fan of weapon degradation and repair (thankfully dropped in the Bioshock games) but otherwise the gameplay design is very good. You can pick this game up very cheaply these days and if you want a nostalgic wander down Video Game Lane you can’t go far wrong with this.4/5			"

												The game is tense, and does its best to make sure that you never feel safe, which is certainly a very different (and more exciting) brand of horror than the jump scares that are the norm of today. It's not even very dark most of the time, most of the horror is psychological and is driven by you doing your best to survive.I feel that from a gameplay perspective, this vastly outshines Bioshock, or at least Bioshock Infitite. Well worth a try if you enjoyed the Bioshock series and are disappointed by the continual dumbing-down of its gameplay, or if you enjoyed Deus Ex, as it is very similar in terms of being a hybrid of tetris-inventory RPG and FPS gameplay.The graphics are definitely where the game has not stood up the test of time, as even when it came out in 1999 it didn't look very good. However, there are mods such as SHTUP and Rebirth that improve the model and texture quality, the models being the most lacking back in the day.In short: worth a try. It is perfectly compatible with modern systems, thanks to the recent NewDark patch, and is definitely worth it to see how much Bioshock Infinite has thrown away the series formula. And if you thought GLaDOS was the universe's scariest evil AI, you're in for a surprise.			"

												System Shock 2, even though it's going on 15 years old now, is still a fantastic game.  Like the first time I played through it, I still jump at certain spots.  With the character customization, it's play-throughs vary considerably.  It's audio log system adds so much to the atmosphere, and while not every audio log is required to advance the game, the extra logs add so much ambiance and story.  This reminds me of a time when it wasn't only graphics that were important, but telling a good story, sucking the players into the game.Game installed perfectly and ran perfectly on my Windows 7 system, something that blew my mind, because I remember trying to jimmy this game into working on older OS's, but newer than what it was designed for, and it was a huge pain in the rear-end.There is really no reason not to purchase, install, and play the hell out of this game...  unless graphics are the only reason you play games.  If you want a great story, a great game, buy System Shock 2.			"

												Tense. Scary. Deep. Gripping. A wonderful experience for a BioShock fan like me, uncovering how the series was born and finding a story just as interesting as Rapture and gameplay way more satisfying than I could have imagined. The fights in this are some of the most white knuckle moments I've had in a game, playing out more like a really high pressure MMORPG battle than the simple shooters future entries were. I encourage anyone who loves good survival gameplay, where you really have to think about what supplies you have and what build your character is, to try this out. And of course, that story.That ♥♥♥♥ing awesome story.			"

												System Shock 2 is known all around as a cult classic in everyway. A game that redefined PC gaming. There hasn't been many games as critically aclaimed as System Shock 2. I actually haven't played System Shock 2 until now. Now i realized what people were talking about. It was a great game style and tight controls. A very diverse gameplay style and unique quality which many games of the new mdoern generation fail to have. An art style that feels like Deus Ex. This game feels like the blueprint for future first person action games to come. It's also a horror game. This game is filled with Scares which will make you wanna wet yourself, but also do it in such a good way that makes it such an immersive experience. Only complaint is that that the graphics haven't aged well at all. But just like the almighty classic Ocarina Of TIme, even with aged graphics, this game has a type of artstyle and charm that surpass Pixels and HD shapes. 9/10 Pros: innovative gameplay, revolutionary first person mechanics, Very unique artstyle and story, An amazing horror immersive experience, a true classic. Cons: Graphics age is very noticable			"

												Shock 1, Ultima Underworld, Terra Nova, Thief sjećate li se tih naslova? Does these names ring any bells? Gaming tvrtka Looking Glass zadužena za sve ove naslove okupivši par u to doba amaterskih programera koji su radili side projects na ovim igrama je izdala pod svojim bannerom System Shock 2.Kako ocijenit igru koja je izašla 1999 godine u 2014toj? Nemoguća misija?! Varate se, kultni naslov nikad ne gubi svoju čar. Iako sam sam igrao igru malo nakon što je u orginalu izašla (konfiguracija mi je bila p4,1GB RAM,Voodoo Graphics) sad nakon 15 godina imam isti osjećaj. Thank you STEAM na playable verziji igre! Pa pogledajte samo review ove igre prije 15 godina, sve te silne nagrade, jednostavno naslov je masterpiece! Od kraja do početka, jedna od rijetkih koja ima što se kaže u našem žanru ""dušu"". Koncept, ideja, storyline, atmosfera. Nimalo zahtjevna a ako volite ovaj žanr (Cyperpunk, Sci-Fi, RPG, Horror) i dalje igriva i držat će vas za tastaturom. Ukratko o System Shock-u:Igra se odvija na zvjezdanom brodu u 2114 godini. Igrač preuzima ulogu usamljenog vojnika koji pokušava zaustaviti epidemiju genetske zaraze koja je poharala brod. Gameplay se sastoji od igre u prvom licu i istraživanja. Također uključuje elemente sistemskih razvijanja jedinstvenih vještina i osobina, kao što su hacking i psionic sposobnosti. Sama igra uključuje elemente RPGa te ima odličnu horor atmosferu.Možda novije generacije neće htjeti i neće imati želje da se vrate ka ovom starom naslovu ali ja kao već sad ""old-gamer"" itekako želim.Nemojte zaboravit da iza ovog naslova stoji Ken Levine ""mastermind"" koji je osmislio i ostvario multi milionski projekat, igru ""Bioshock"" nasljednika, te kroz nju progurao sve elemente gameinga zastupljenog u System Shocku. Čak je u više navrata rekao da je System Shock sa svojim uspjesima i razvojem te načinom igre bio orginalno prethodnik Bioshock-a.http://theigraison.wordpress.com/ "

												System Shock 2 is a must buy for ANYONE who likes Action RPGs, First Person Horror, or story-driven games. This game was the inspiration for BioShock and was made by most of the same team. Irrational Games with some help from the gods of the First-Person RPG, the now-defunct Looking Glass Studios, crafted an amazing first person atmospheric RPG experience that has some of the best writing and deepest mechanics of any game ever. The visual style has aged pretty well aside from the character models but mods can fix it or you can just ignore the visuals entirely because the sound design is where the game shines. The haunting moans of the hybrids, the slow beeps of security cameras, the announcements from an AI totally oblivious to what has happened, and of course, the taunting of one of gaming's greatest female characters, SHODAN. If you like BioShock, System Shock 2 is BioShock but better.			"

												System Shock 2 is a mix of FPS, RPG and even survival horror, Irrational Games's sequel to the the Looking Glass's classic using their Dark Engine, released in 1999. You probably know this game as ""that some random game that every classic gamer is required to be bonkers about"". It also was supposed to come out for Sega Dreamcast but didn't. Shame.Then in 2013 this game got rereleased digitally thanks to Night Dive studios. Who are quire a heroes, managing to bring this IP out of legal hell, as it was owned by three companies. With some insurance company being one. Now they own it and thus were able to re-release System Shock games so we can all buy it legally and digitally. They also updated the game to work on modern system.Technically, this game should work pretty nicely on modern systems. It supports widescreen too.However I had a strange glitch where cutscene movies will not play if I had Firefox Internet browser running. No idea what was conflicting there. But I guess it's just your everyday PC Oh-So-Master Race thing. HA!This game also includes coop multiplayer. Not sure about multiplayer community, after all it doesn't use server browser, you have to connect directly to IP. So don't expect to just play with random, gotta nag friends up.And from what I heard multiplayer is there because EA, the original publisher, demanded it. It really is single-player experience. So I guess it's something just-for-funz, not designed for. I just know that they would put game on Hard difficulty. But I didn't yet play it.Plotwise the game is a direct continuation of the first System Shock, a cyberpunk setting. Or sci-fi. SHODAN's returns once again, as spoiled by cover art. But there is a new horror you must defeat as well on Von Braun ship, the first ever Faster Than Light ship with unknown side effects, accomplished by the Rivenbark ship for security. Or rather, because PsiOptimum and UNN don't trust each other.Game itself is often called a father of Bioshock games, as well as infulencing other FPS games. There are similar things to it indeed. There is a wrench, there is magical PSI powers, there are logs to learn stories and codes.You will explore the ship, trying to survive and often backtracking. Ammo is rare and you often will have to use wrench. While also having RPG system that will decide what you can do and what you currently can't equip.And when compared to System Shock 1 it pretty much adds two things heavily: RPG elements and Survival Horror.Yet I can't help but to feel dissapointment in this mix of FPS and RPG. Probably because I loved the first one more. The first game was about world immersion, it was about combining all the elements into one belivable game. It had RPG elements, but cleverly implented. You was growing in power, but you did it not with some stats management but by finding new weapons and new hardware, which gave you new powers that you also had to use wisely.It also gave you full feeling that it was YOU who was taking on SHODAN. No pointers, no objective clearly written, you had to figure it all out by yourself from logs.The sequel hovewer decided to add much more videogamey RPG elements to it, that it pretty much screws the original ideology of System Shock. The stats building ones, yep. And yea, it's one of those cases where the abstraction of RPG elements doesn't fit perfectly with FPS immersion. Like, for example, you need to have at least 3 points in ""standard"" weapons category to equip shotgun. Like, we aren't talking about shooting horribly, it's about not knowing how to pull the trigger, it seems.It also isn't well balanced either. There are options that are much more efficient than others. And some options are so unefficient in how much precious points they require, it's hard for me to say that this game is designed for variety of playstyle. More like for punishing for not knowing what's ahead. It's a linear game after all, with 10+ hours requirement, so it's not sliding. Like, here high investments into hacking, mantaintance and standart weapons are requirements, but no one will tell you so.Ok, I just did. Welp, at least was lucky that my build was using those so I didn't screw myself.That, and it feels a bit more dumbened down as well. Ok, more specific, in the name of RPGness, the hacking mini-games were changed from the proper puzzles into just stat-checking RNG thing. And lots of PSI magic weren't so useful.SHODAN also felt less signifant here, strange that she gained any reputation of character and made every second person on retro forum have her as avatar because of this sequel. That, and I felt much less like I was the one who was moving on storyline, instead being felt like an errand boy. With all objectives clearly being told to you in PDA notes, along with all codes that you have ever saw, so there is only a single time you have to kinda remember and analyse it yourself (""art"" part).I mean, it's not exactly what I would usually complain much. I don't hate what people call ""casualized"" fun. Like it, even. But we are talking about sequel to System Shock 1. And not just sequel, but the one which is called hardcore old classic and has 96 metacritic score and just gets praised as best game ever. And I came in with my body and mind ready for such thing. But oh well.Not to say that this sequel is a lost cause. After all it adds more of survival horror to it and some of it is awesome! Thanks to technology of 1999 too. It feels even less abstract and more like real ship. And with such technology, it can show horror much more effective. Mind it, there are no jumpscares. Just twisted, trippy things going on, especially as the end comes closer. It really is quite experience. With nice ambient music occasionally. And action ones too.Heck, it even makes you often feel unsafe. There is nothing like being busy reading a newly acquired log only to notice a mutant walking into the room where you are hiding.I also liked the fact that it was taking itself more like survival horror gameplay-wise too, where your ammo and recources are scarse. And everything costs nanities (money thing) now. Well, they kept respawning chamber thing which may not fit with survival, but at least it costs nanities too, even if very very cheap.It even makes ammo scarse and all guns are easily breakable. Which sounds like survival horror thing. Almost. Because they didn't manage to balance it right, as early in game guns break so much that they are more scarse than ammo. And later in game the whole survival horror feels to go away and instead replaced by just hard corridor shooter. And hard corridor shooter isn't same as hard survival horror. Not to mention that while other Survival Horror have ""shoot or run"" thing, this one has ""WRENCH THEM ALL and sometimes shoot"". No, seriously, melee there is pretty much for everything aside from worms because they are too tiny. Annoying thing. System Shock 1 also had you using melee a lot, but that was because it was very effective and thus mixing of melee/ranged was fun. In SS2, I dunno, it just isn't. You use unfun melee because game doesn't want you to have fun.Okay, I actually had a fun. And as said, I got lucky with my build. Just a shame that in beggining it will not be much fun for most with those gun breakage while at end it deflates. Then again, later levels, after Von Braun ship, are quite generic and mediocre, really.Also, research mechanic was interesting. Real-time slow process which also requires visiting chemistry rooms for some chemistry, as there are too many to carry.But you know, it's quite a goody adventure otherwise. Albeit not the best game ever, sure thing it's not. Quite overrated. But hey, that happens sometimes. Hopefully System Shock 3 will be more in line of what System Shock 1 was standing for.That, and I want to take one of those maintaince bots to my house. Too cute.			"

												A great game. It has worn well through the years as a story, and even though the graphics may turn you away, don't let them. The atmosphere of this game is executed very well and the feeling that something is lurking around the corner always catches you by surprise. It has fast-paced action elements with a unsettling dark tone. An RPG for the books. Strongly recommend playing in a dark room, with headphones and by yourself. This game has been an amazing experience. I strongly recommend purchasing this game.			"

Precursor to the Bioshock series (which were considered to be the ""spiritual""successors to this very game.) The controls take some getting used to, since this game released more than 15 years ago. It's challenging. Ammo is scarce as are nanites. Enemies require specialized ammo. Limited inventory space necessitates the need to constantly evaluate what to keep. The sound effects are the best part of this game and will constantly having you wiping your sweaty palms on your pants every time. There are some jump scares, but mainly the stage is set through the sound. Will you run in fear or take the fight to them? Run!Join Us! "

												System Shock 2 is a must buy for ANYONE who likes Action RPGs, First Person Horror, or story-driven games. This game was the inspiration for BioShock and was made by most of the same team. Irrational Games with some help from the gods of the First-Person RPG, the now-defunct Looking Glass Studios, crafted an amazing first person atmospheric RPG experience that has some of the best writing and deepest mechanics of any game ever. The visual style has aged pretty well aside from the character models but mods can fix it or you can just ignore the visuals entirely because the sound design is where the game shines. The haunting moans of the hybrids, the slow beeps of security cameras, the announcements from an AI totally oblivious to what has happened, and of course, the taunting of one of gaming's greatest female characters, SHODAN. If you like BioShock, System Shock 2 is BioShock but better.			"

												Do you like sci-fi? Do you like FPS? Do you like RPG? Do you like cyberpunk? Did you happen to like a game called: ""Deus Ex"", by any chance? If you answered ""yes"" any of these, then this game is most likely relevant to your interests. System Shock 2 is a wonderful mix of RPG and FPS in a dark and isolated enviroment, so it's something for the horror fans as well. This is one dark and mysterious game, and can be a bit hard to learn from the start, but once you get a hang of it, it's one of the more immersive games you've probably ever played. It's not really expensive, since it's an old game, but it's a good one for that matter, this was the game that inspired many games today. If you wanna see where many of the popular games nowadays have taken inspiration from, you should definately try System Shock 2.			"

												This is the absolute best game in history and there's several high definition packs out there to make the textures less jarringly low-res and the models have more than 3 polys. If you haven't played it you need to. It is the game which created my all-time favorite game type; shooter-RPG hybrids. SS2 is the direct cause of the entire Deus Ex series and the entire Bioshock series. On top of all that, strangely enough it has 4 person story co-op. Rarely any games these days have story co-op. Its a little awkward in the horror-survival setting of SS2, but still that's pretty awesome.Anyways, all around one of the best video games ever made.			"

												Since this game was made in 1999 you notice how crappy the graphics or NPC's are, however, this game is amazing, the potientail that this game has is outstanding. I was pretty much, hoping for the author to pop out all of the sudden and say ""I plan to update this game completly, everyone who bought System Shock 2 Will get a free copy of the new updated game System Shock 3 :)"" But that didn't happen, Oh well, at least we have you system shock 2. The game itself is good, if you know what to do and how to do it, if you don't know what to do or where to go, then you might as well be trying to eat pie without your mouth. I really enjoy it, and i was suprised on how good the game was considering the fact it was made, a while back, not only that but i was also suprised on how smoothly it ran throught the whole time i was playing, perhaps it got scared of the old graphics. I would recommend this game to the people that are open minded when it comes to old games, don't mind playing old video games, and people who like scare's now and then. Would not recommend to people whom Dislike horror games, outdated graphics and plots, ect ect. Other than that I would rate 11/10 Cats.			"

												System Shock 2 is a mix of FPS, RPG and even survival horror, Irrational Games's sequel to the the Looking Glass's classic using their Dark Engine, released in 1999. You probably know this game as ""that some random game that every classic gamer is required to be bonkers about"". It also was supposed to come out for Sega Dreamcast but didn't. Shame.Then in 2013 this game got rereleased digitally thanks to Night Dive studios. Who are quire a heroes, managing to bring this IP out of legal hell, as it was owned by three companies. With some insurance company being one. Now they own it and thus were able to re-release System Shock games so we can all buy it legally and digitally. They also updated the game to work on modern system.Technically, this game should work pretty nicely on modern systems. It supports widescreen too.However I had a strange glitch where cutscene movies will not play if I had Firefox Internet browser running. No idea what was conflicting there. But I guess it's just your everyday PC Oh-So-Master Race thing. HA!This game also includes coop multiplayer. Not sure about multiplayer community, after all it doesn't use server browser, you have to connect directly to IP. So don't expect to just play with random, gotta nag friends up.And from what I heard multiplayer is there because EA, the original publisher, demanded it. It really is single-player experience. So I guess it's something just-for-funz, not designed for. I just know that they would put game on Hard difficulty. But I didn't yet play it.Plotwise the game is a direct continuation of the first System Shock, a cyberpunk setting. Or sci-fi. SHODAN's returns once again, as spoiled by cover art. But there is a new horror you must defeat as well on Von Braun ship, the first ever Faster Than Light ship with unknown side effects, accomplished by the Rivenbark ship for security. Or rather, because PsiOptimum and UNN don't trust each other.Game itself is often called a father of Bioshock games, as well as infulencing other FPS games. There are similar things to it indeed. There is a wrench, there is magical PSI powers, there are logs to learn stories and codes.You will explore the ship, trying to survive and often backtracking. Ammo is rare and you often will have to use wrench. While also having RPG system that will decide what you can do and what you currently can't equip.And when compared to System Shock 1 it pretty much adds two things heavily: RPG elements and Survival Horror.Yet I can't help but to feel dissapointment in this mix of FPS and RPG. Probably because I loved the first one more. The first game was about world immersion, it was about combining all the elements into one belivable game. It had RPG elements, but cleverly implented. You was growing in power, but you did it not with some stats management but by finding new weapons and new hardware, which gave you new powers that you also had to use wisely.It also gave you full feeling that it was YOU who was taking on SHODAN. No pointers, no objective clearly written, you had to figure it all out by yourself from logs.The sequel hovewer decided to add much more videogamey RPG elements to it, that it pretty much screws the original ideology of System Shock. The stats building ones, yep. And yea, it's one of those cases where the abstraction of RPG elements doesn't fit perfectly with FPS immersion. Like, for example, you need to have at least 3 points in ""standard"" weapons category to equip shotgun. Like, we aren't talking about shooting horribly, it's about not knowing how to pull the trigger, it seems.It also isn't well balanced either. There are options that are much more efficient than others. And some options are so unefficient in how much precious points they require, it's hard for me to say that this game is designed for variety of playstyle. More like for punishing for not knowing what's ahead. It's a linear game after all, with 10+ hours requirement, so it's not sliding. Like, here high investments into hacking, mantaintance and standart weapons are requirements, but no one will tell you so.Ok, I just did. Welp, at least was lucky that my build was using those so I didn't screw myself.That, and it feels a bit more dumbened down as well. Ok, more specific, in the name of RPGness, the hacking mini-games were changed from the proper puzzles into just stat-checking RNG thing. And lots of PSI magic weren't so useful.SHODAN also felt less signifant here, strange that she gained any reputation of character and made every second person on retro forum have her as avatar because of this sequel. That, and I felt much less like I was the one who was moving on storyline, instead being felt like an errand boy. With all objectives clearly being told to you in PDA notes, along with all codes that you have ever saw, so there is only a single time you have to kinda remember and analyse it yourself (""art"" part).I mean, it's not exactly what I would usually complain much. I don't hate what people call ""casualized"" fun. Like it, even. But we are talking about sequel to System Shock 1. And not just sequel, but the one which is called hardcore old classic and has 96 metacritic score and just gets praised as best game ever. And I came in with my body and mind ready for such thing. But oh well.Not to say that this sequel is a lost cause. After all it adds more of survival horror to it and some of it is awesome! Thanks to technology of 1999 too. It feels even less abstract and more like real ship. And with such technology, it can show horror much more effective. Mind it, there are no jumpscares. Just twisted, trippy things going on, especially as the end comes closer. It really is quite experience. With nice ambient music occasionally. And action ones too.Heck, it even makes you often feel unsafe. There is nothing like being busy reading a newly acquired log only to notice a mutant walking into the room where you are hiding.I also liked the fact that it was taking itself more like survival horror gameplay-wise too, where your ammo and recources are scarse. And everything costs nanities (money thing) now. Well, they kept respawning chamber thing which may not fit with survival, but at least it costs nanities too, even if very very cheap.It even makes ammo scarse and all guns are easily breakable. Which sounds like survival horror thing. Almost. Because they didn't manage to balance it right, as early in game guns break so much that they are more scarse than ammo. And later in game the whole survival horror feels to go away and instead replaced by just hard corridor shooter. And hard corridor shooter isn't same as hard survival horror. Not to mention that while other Survival Horror have ""shoot or run"" thing, this one has ""WRENCH THEM ALL and sometimes shoot"". No, seriously, melee there is pretty much for everything aside from worms because they are too tiny. Annoying thing. System Shock 1 also had you using melee a lot, but that was because it was very effective and thus mixing of melee/ranged was fun. In SS2, I dunno, it just isn't. You use unfun melee because game doesn't want you to have fun.Okay, I actually had a fun. And as said, I got lucky with my build. Just a shame that in beggining it will not be much fun for most with those gun breakage while at end it deflates. Then again, later levels, after Von Braun ship, are quite generic and mediocre, really.Also, research mechanic was interesting. Real-time slow process which also requires visiting chemistry rooms for some chemistry, as there are too many to carry.But you know, it's quite a goody adventure otherwise. Albeit not the best game ever, sure thing it's not. Quite overrated. But hey, that happens sometimes. Hopefully System Shock 3 will be more in line of what System Shock 1 was standing for.That, and I want to take one of those maintaince bots to my house. Too cute.			"

												As the precursor (or spiritual predecessor, if you will) to BioShock, System Shock 2 will feel familiar to fans of Ken Levine's undersea adventures with its emphasis on weapon- and power-based gameplay, exploratory levels, and varied upgrade system that lets you craft your character to your liking. If you're a fan of classic RPGs, then this game is for you. A nice combination of action, sci-fi, and horror, System Shock 2 may very well leave your system shocked.			"

												WHOAAAAAA! I picked it up because of its high metacritic score and lots of people say it's a classic and one of the most important shooter. I later found out it was made by Irrational Games, the ones who made my one of my favorite games, Bioshock. The ressemblances are striking. It's really quite the experience to play the spiritual ancestor of Bioshock. The controls may intimidate players but the whole gameplay isn't meant for your average gamer. I suggest you to configure the keys to something you're more used to. Any Bioshock fan will feel at home in this game. The pacing is similar although the map are less straight forward. It's incredibly challenging, yet, rewarding. Ammo, health packs, respawn areas, weapons, everything is scarce. I gotta admit that I had to use the console frequently to help myself. I highly suggest you to quicksave as often as you can. I bound quicksave to Enter and quickload to Backspace. The ending is quite amazing also. I wish I'd discover this earlier when I was a kid but in 1999 I was 5. Great game, a must have for Bioshock fans, at $2,50 it's a steal!			"

												Don't mind my recorded time. i Played and beat the GOG version of the game.Simply putting, if you are fan of Bioshock games, you will feel right at home.System Shock 2 is survival horror set in  spaceship filled with zombie-like monsters and other aliens.The game had quite a good atmosphere to it and sometimes can be challenging and tough, with weapons break often, ammo is rare and and you have to use heal items a lot, and they don't heal you instantly.like Bioshock, you have your Bio-weapons for magic attacks, you can hack systems and turrets to your advantage and develop special ammo for your weapons and upgrade your characters (Toughness, Hack ability, stamina,etc...)If you are into survival horror FPS games and a fan of Bioshock i absolutely recommend you this game, and yes, it has an active modding community.Just note: if you have a modern PC, this game might give you troubles. be sure to install community patches.

~ Your flesh is an insult to the perfection of the digital. ~You've probably heard it by now, but System Shock 2 can basically be described best as ""RPG BioShock set in space"". But considering SS2 was first it basically means BioShock is ""FPS System Shock 2 set under the sea"". But I digress. SS2 takes place on the Von Braun, a spaceship that's surrounded by the darkness of space. After training for four years (or four minutes in our lives) you wake up on the Von Braun. If that's not enough to feel claustrophobic, early on you also find out something mysteriously and equally terrifying had happened on the ship on your absence. Guided by another survivor you start from the bottom of the ship and you work yourself to the top to uncover the ship's secrets. No marks, no hints, you're mostly on your own and there's little to no holdings hands (as it should be). Gameplay wise it holds up great, the combat is deep, the pacing is good, and there may be some dated animations here and there, but nothing too serious. Combat can be experienced as a little less flexible than BioShock for example, but that's because you're ""stuck"" with your current build, due to the skill points you invested in it, which means you can't drastically change your play style in SS2, which was possible in BioShock. But on the other hand, it means the replay value is higher in SS2.This is the first time I played this 16 year old game and I'd definitely recommend this for other people who like a good RPG dripping with atmosphere that doesn't hold your hands, like most of the games nowadays.+ An isolated feeling, claustrophobic, drips with atmosphere.+ Main antagonist is very sinister and interesting, good story.+ Optional audio logs you can find add to the atmosphere.+ Expansive gameplay with lots of options to suit your play style. + Little to no holding hands. There are no markers of any sorts.-/+ - No subtitles. Which isn't a big problem, even for non-native English speakers like me, but sometimes there's a lot of background noise in-game which makes it a little hard to hear. But there's a log system that you can use to reread most of the dialogues and diaries.- Some (not all) songs are way too ""bombastic' and sound somewhat out of place, they don't have that feeling of isolation and claustrophobia to begin with. - Some enemies, at least at first, spawn very quickly, which can lead to some frustration. Especially in the beginning when you're not exactly full on Medical and Psi hypos.- The final boss battle ends on a ridiculous and downright out-of-place note that may leave you with somewhat of a sour taste in your mouth. ""Nah."" The final cut scene after that is good though.  "

												Rich story-telling and clever game mechanics result in one of the greatest games of all time.

												This might be the best game I've ever played, seriously.After no luck with the original Deus Ex from the fact I just couldn't get into it (Human Revolution is my favorite game), I was rather jaded and cynical. Having loved Bioshock 1 and 2 equally and the love I have for the dead space franchise (even though it's annoyingly console oriented), I thought ""eh it's only like £1 on ♥♥♥"". The major dissapointment of Bioshock: Infinite, granted I only played on it on console, made me want to explore the roots of two of my favorite games. I did research into Irrational Games throughout the late 90's and thinking of those programmers, sound engineers and art designers crammed into a tiny room creating this gave me a whole new appreciation for video game creation.So on starting the game, I found all the different elements confusing at first (as with a lot of games), but immediately started noticing the similarities between bioshock and SS2:  - PSI = EVE - Cybernetic Modules = ADAM - Security Codes - Wrench - and much more.Given that this game was created barely a year after I was born, it has aged phenominally well and feels like a modern AAA title just with worse graphics. Also SHODAN is now my favorite villian of all time, maniny due to the creepy apperance and voice(s). The Many is also a VERY creepy villian and ALMOST tops SHODAN and how I noticed the similarities between The Many and The Corruption.I didn't feel as if playing the first game was nessasary and I think even after playing this I would find it just too dated. I didn't however, use any additional mods or graphical enhancements and played on easy because I'm bad :P. I can't wait to play the user created levels.So in summary, this game is near perfect and DO NOT EVEN HESITATE to buy it, seriously. The Many flesh levels and the rather underwhelming boss fight were the ONLY bad things (I actually liked the ending, made me chuckle). And then we have news that System Shock 3 in development and Terri Brosius is again voicing SHODAN which is the best news ever. I feel as if this game was made for me, as do so many others.-----98/100 - a.k.a BUY IT!			"

10/10System Shock 2 has got one of the best ambientes I've seen.To me this game really kept being interesting and had a tension that led to me loving this game.The graphics might be incredibly old and pixelated - but it's not about the graphics, it's about the design, what the creators use their graphics for. And in this case they used it very well. I like all the designs of the enemies, without any exception.There might be a linear storyline, because you also won't ever get the possibility to say something, but therefore it just reminds me of Half Life 2, which is also an awesome game.But at least the story here is quite good and all the hints and audio logs lying around add up to that tense atmosphere of mistrust.Also there are fanmade missions which can be found on the internet, which are sometimes way harder than the original game (which starts as a pretty tough game but becomes easier if you skill the right things [at least when you play it on ""hard"" as I did, but this is seriously recommended!])._____________________All in all, I can only recommend this game. The price is nothing for such a quality of gameplay, atmosphere and story.Go and get it if you haven't. And become a part of the many....			"

												One of the greatest games ever. A fantastic blend of everything I love about games. Great elements of narrative, RPG, shooting, powers, item management. Great detailed ability customisation, play the way you want. Also, SHODAAAAANNNNN. Yes, it's old now, but it (to me) doesn't feel overly dated, especially with the fantastic fan mods applied. Great for a challenge too, when you get tired of how easy a lot of games are nowadays, going back to classics like SS2 is just wonderful. If you have played it before, buy it again, it's a great blast of nostalgia and still holds up. If you haven't played it before, I honestly can't see you disliking it if you like shooters, RPGs, great games.Please please please play this game.			"

												My personality- I'm a player who prides himself in trying to experience a game as the makers had originally intended. This includes setting the difficulty in most games to a high enough level that it requires me to put thought into how I invest my limited resources, yet not so difficult that I'm trying to save precious ammo (or health, etc) by fighting a single fight only to run back to the last point of safety to re-group. I also appreciate (somewhat) linear narrative games with in depth plots and character building...REVIEW - I found this game extremely enjoyable for almost it's whole duration. The plot was something I could imerse myself into and get hooked. The character depth was slightly limited (with respect to some of the newer games that have come out) but not so much that it felt like it lacked something. Putting myself back into the year this game was released, I would have indeed called it revolutionary. A great game overall.(SPOILERS) However...I was extremely irritated by one HUGE miss... throughout the game, the choices I made left it literally impossible to defeat the final boss. I had chosen to invest my point in skill other than hacking, which when it came time to fight SHODAN without ICE-picks it was literally impossible to defeat her. I did not find this out till later. I spent a long time fighting her, intrigued and perplexed by the difficulty, I kept telling myself that there was something I'm missing. This increased my anticipation for the moment when I finally figured it out. Eventually I explored what seemed like every option. I resorted, to what I consider my LAST resort, I looked up how to defeat her online. If any of you share my personality, you know how difficult a choice this was. What I discovered was that, in fact, I was doing all the right things, but because of my choices ealier in the game, I could not finish the game. This left me irritated and frustrated. In my opinion one of the best things about a game is the nostalgic feeling that you get when you think about a game that you had finished awhile back. The final boss SHODAN removed this feeling from this game for me entirely. My suggestion... if you really want to experience this game as the revolutionary and awesome game that it truly was... Put at least one point into Hacking!If you take my advice you will experience a great game, unfortunately my own was ruined by a design miss on the developer's part.			"

												If you're a gamer who needs cutting-edge graphics to make a game worthwhile...take a pass on this one.  But to every one else...what are you waiting for?System Shock 2 was (and IS) a crossroads in gaming history.  It's the first true 'hybrid'...combination of horror, survival, RPG, FPS, and story-driven actioner.  PLUS it's got the single greatest 'reveal' in gaming history!  (NOTE - remember that it's 17 years old...if you've been playing that long, you'll remember that games didn't hold a lot of surprises back then.)The mechanics and inventory management aspects are a bit clunky, but they're easily doable once you get into the swing of it.  And unlike a lot of more recent RPG games, you absolutely CAN NOT max all skills, particularly if you go with the hardest settings.  Which means that, on the 'Impossible' rank, you have to be very careful about where you spend your upgrade points.  If you're smart, you may be able to max the one skill that saves your life.First timers may find it a bit of a cliche, but you have to remember...this is the game that created those cliches.  Classic games like Bioshock and Deus Ex were spawned from System Shock 2...so if you are a fan of those games, you owe it to yourself to experience the grandfather of them all.  But maybe I'm just an old fart who loves the evolution of games...decide for yourself.			"

												Are you the kind of gamer who almost exclusively enjoys super-fast first-person games in which you race about at lightning speed, effortlessly shooting hundreds and thousands of enemies with the aid of a seemingly inexhaustible supply of ammo loaded into a vast array of super-duper-mega-weapons which never jam and are capable of obliterating almost an entire herd of beasties in a single mouse-click?  Then you may well enjoy the Serious Sam games...and should probably give THIS one a wide ♥♥♥♥in' berth.   System Shock 2 is one HARD sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ of a game.  At first I thought it might just be me - as it so often is - but a quick chat to a Steam friend who's much more of a ""natural"" at games than yours truly confirmed that not only had he found it challenging, he had in fact found it SO frigging difficult that he just threw in the towel altogether, before the match had even officially begun.  This game is NOT from the user-friendly era which we're so used to nowadays, in which kind-hearted games essentially hold your hand for the entirety of the journey, like an oh-so-generous ""self-help"" coach who won't let you give up, no matter how hard times might get.  This game is more akin to a brutish boot-camp commandant, who just can't wait to push your worthless face down into the mud one more time, just in case you weren't suitably humiliated by the first ninety-nine times.  In short, this game DOES NOT PLAY NICE.  But for the most part, it does at least play FAIR...unlike, say, the recent Slender: The Arrival, a game whose difficulty can be mostly attributed to rather dubious design and execution.  Whereas System Shock 2, for all its frustration-inducing mean-spiritedness, is in fact an EXCEPTIONALLY well-designed and executed piece of work.  But a game for the weak-hearted or impatient it most certainly is not.   Weapons jam and need to be repaired, frequently.  There's ♥♥♥♥-all healing, certainly in the earlier stages.  And the maps, one of my few genuine ""complaints"" about the game, almost require a degree in Interstellar Architecture to follow.  To make matters trickier, there aren't any arrows helpfully pointing you in the ""right"" direction at all times, and it's basically up to you (or the always-generous Google) to work out just what the hell all those items you keep picking up actually do (and which ones you should bother to keep, when your limited Inventory space inevitably fills up almost every time you search a new area...hell, it took me a while to realise that all the pot plants I'd collected were basically extraneous)!  And what about all those different skills you can choose to spend your all-too-precious ""cybermodules"" on...""What the hell do I need a ""Research"" skill for, you crazy, crazy game"", I hear you cry?!  Well, the simplest answer to that question is, ""That all depends on HOW you want to play the game.""  Put another way:  Don't expect to explore all the possibilities System Shock 2 has to offer on the first play-through.  I personally didn't even TOUCH any of the ""Psi"" attributes, and only barely scratched the surface of all that the ""Tech"" stream of abilities has to offer.  (For all the dumb-♥♥♥ people out there, like me, maybe just stick to being a half-decent fighter to begin with...doesn't take a genius to work out what a gun is for, while the worthiness of the ""Hack"" skill, for example, may be a tad more obscure at the outset.)   So okay, I get it, it's hard and it's complicated, but is it actually any GOOD?  Well, one need only look at its LEGACY to see how important and influential this game has been.  Unfortunately for System Shock 2, it appears to have been released at much the same time as a certain tiny little piece of gaming called Half Life, and it would appear that that game and its subsequent franchise stole much of SS2's thunder.  But have you also heard of a series called the Bioshock games?  Well, this is the ""spiritual predecessor"", designed by much the same people.  You can also spot the influence this game has had on, say, the Dead Space and F.E.A.R. franchises from several small galaxies away.  The more ""RPG""-ish aspects of Borderlands, et al, would also appear to owe something of a debt herein, what with the space-age vending machines you can use to purchase items and ammo and healing and what-not from.    A true trail-blazer of a game indeed.  But how do the graphics and sound stack up against modern games, then?  Well...okay, the graphics have dated a little.  But they're more than made up for by some of the most imaginative and downright disturbing sound design in VIDEO GAME HISTORY.  It's nothing less than a work of art, ya'll.  And the story, while suffering from the limitations which are unavoidable when you're talking about a game where you basically traverse large distances while killing lots and lots of ""baddies"", is about as good as you can reasonably ask such things to be.   Look, it's not a completely ""perfect"" game.  As well as the aforementioned maps, there's other frustrations to be overcome and/or tolerated, such as the incredibly irritating tendency for a completely random ""wandering"" enemy to waltz into the room in which you thought you might finally have sufficient breathing space to listen to that ""PDA"" you've been carrying for the past several minutes.  You're gonna have to learn to do things like bring up the Inventory screen and heal yourself WHILST RUNNING down a corridor avoiding enemy fire.  And most of all, you're gonna learn to Save just about every time you pick up a new item or defeat a fresh enemy.  But with a little patience and just a teeny tiny bit of skill - Lord knows, I have precious little of the latter - you might actually manage to defeat the completely insane HAL - whoops, slight slip there, make that SHODAN - and emerge triumphant in a world ruled over by rampant technology.  Sounds like a nice change from your ""real life"", day-to-day existence, don't it?    Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a not-entirely-mindless ""shooter"", and an absolute must-play for anyone with an interest in the history of such games.  Doom, Quake, Half-Life, THIS...that's just about the list, I believe.  I guess I should probably play System Shock 1 some time, too...dang, no rest for the wicked...Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

The beggining is sheeit for people who play the game for the first time, just like me. But once you continue deeper into the game, you feel less restricted since you have full automaps that show the way all the places are made up and you have more powerful weaponry against all enemies you meet.

												SYSTEM SHOCK 2 deserves way more attention than it gets. As somebody who hated Fps games, I can safely say that this game is a piece of art and was executed to the best intentions of consumers. The whole idea of system shock 2 is similar to system shock 1 but is executed a bit better. First of all the hud was better positioned to give the user a better idea of the systems that ensure the players survival. The log, audio messaging aspect of this makes the player responsible for driving the story and finding out what happened in the lauberstraum . Shodan altough not a menacing force she was in the first ss, still feels like a unstoppable force since she is basically your caretaker and enemy. The combat in system shock 2 is actually part of a rps like upgrade system so you can be a cyber psychic or a military unit.10/10 Beats half life 1 and 2, but 3?Definitely can give Ocarina of time a run for the best game of all time "

												I'm writing this review as someone who has no nostalgia for the game. I never played it back in the day, but finally played it today. It's... good. In fact, I could see if I was playing the game back then, I would have considered the game amazing. Unfortuantely, being used to modern games, there are a lot of things that make this game feel extremely dated. There's 0 auto-saving. Which means when after 45min of playing the game, when I died, I went back to the beginning. I understand, auto-saving wasn't really a thing back then. I can't blame the developers for that. However, it is something to take heavily into consideration when playing this game. SAVE OFTEN. I liked the game's set up and tutorial. It made you connect more with the character by choosing what branch of the military they joined and what missions they went on while at the same time choosing stats. It is a unique and interesting approach even today. The controls are extremely dated, so I highly recommend you customize them first chance you get.Other than the dated aspects, the game is great. Highly recommended. I probably won't play more just because losing 45min of progress was a huge bummer and I have a ton of other games to beat anyway.			"

												Good game.  Clunky old school interface and inventory/log system take a little bit to get a handle on, but after about the first hour you'll be used to them.  Good story, good atmosphere, surprisingly long (took me about 16-19 hours), and you get to choose how to progress your character at the upgrade stations.  A couple of negative things bring the game down a bit.  1.  The map system is pretty awful.  You get sent all over the ship and oftentimes it's hard to figure out what connects to what, or where exactly you're supposed to go.  2.  The game gets ridiculously easy once you get the assault rifle, are able to use it, and get it fully upgraded.  3.  Enemies respawn in areas occasionally.  It's only really annoying early on when you have very little Armor Piercing ammo, and the game chooses to respawn a bunch of robots.  None of these are a huge deal though.  Solid game that's worth playing.  Also, Bebop is an alcoholic.			"

												System Shock 2 is a game that a lot of modern shooters try and fail to emulate, because there was a cult classic love to it that wasn't because of any overused horror trope or any trendy game mechanic. No, the game actually broke from all of the standards by incorporating RPG elements along with its FPS style. You'll hear some people complain about the inventory system. Others will be hung up on the late-nineties graphics (which are close to those of the original Half-Life). I even have one friend who stopped playing simply because he couldn't take one of the enemies seriously.Don't listen to these people who get hung up on the small stuff, and don't be surprised by the difficulty that the game presents you. System Shock 2 was made back when games weren't willing to sacrifice quality just to get you to the ending credits and the obligatory sequel teaser trailer. It's a game that makes you consistently and intelligently plan your way through in order to survive, let alone make progress, aboard the Von Braun. There are multiple ways to play the game, with different types of weapons, and many skills and strengths to invest in. This means extreme replay value, and ensures that you won't get bored quickly.My advice to you is to pick up this game for yourself and make your own opinion. If you come into it with a modern bias, you might not give yourself a chance to enjoy it. Just install it, play it, and see where it takes you.And my biggest tip? For the first time through, put yourself on Away, log off of your communication devices and programs (Skype, AIM, et al.), and play System Shock 2 alone. The experience alone will leave you wanting more.			"

												even though i grew up with the old generations of games, nowadays i rarely finish them, when i decide to catch up on titles i didnt play back in the day. This game fascinated me from the first moment with its atmosphere and chalenging gameplay. As someone who rarely plays shooter i got sucked in by the setting and mostly the fact that this game isnt the usual splatter horror  or some fancy action shooter, but a rare gem, that shows that it is possible to build a story driven shooter that has more to offer than simple run and gun spiced with some rpg elements. The game gives ppl the possibility to play smart, as it requires some amount of skillpoint, inventory, health and ammunition management and requires the player to tend to his weapons, as they can break if not maintained and can be upgraded (nothing fancy, just sth like lvlups). All of those actions require some skills that can be accuired for your character. Those features would be considered ""fun-stoppers"" nowadays, but honestly this is what makes games playable for me. This game was made by the ppl who later developed the ""Bio Shock"" games (the name is similar), this  game is the spiritual predecessor of those games and i liked it more than Bioshock. This game is aswell considered a classic as it influenced many games modern A+ titles, e.g. Portal (it is said that ""Glados"" from portal is inspired by ""Shodan"" from system shock) and Dead Space (inspired by the gameplay of System shock 2).

												System Shock 2 is a masterpiece.Criminy-- although the technology behind it is heavily dated, it is still able to frighten me. A spaceship crawling with clones of a motherly figure calling out to her egg-children and defending them with a bracelet that shoots lasers is apparently enough to make me tense. The gameplay was certainly ambitious in 1999; FPS+RPG elements; well, its successor BioShock saw very little need to update the formula. I like to think of this as ""BioShock done right,"" which is both correct and cringeworthy.SHODAN is a proper, taunting villain and unreliable narrator. The game has good pacing and a good story. Like a good survivor horror, it is very difficult. Some bugs with scripted events made me redo sections of the game because I could not progress. My god the awful default 1999-era FPS controls.			"

												I played this for the first time in 2015, and it is still a fantastic game, even without nostalgia. The gameplay and AI are dated, and I would recommend looking for some graphics mods, but even after 16 years this is one of the better games that I've played. Firstly, the atmosphere in this game is incredible. I could only play in 30-minute spurts for the first few levels, because the game really creeped me out. The audio and sound effects in this game are great and help set the mood. If you've played bioshock(if you haven't you really should), this game is very similar, although it's also a lot scarier than bioshock. After some time playing, you start to get a little used to the constant feeling of fear, but as you progress you encounter more things that are even more unsettling. The audio logs added pieces of the story together as you collect them, and make you wonder what the hell happened on this ship. The atmosphere and story sucks you in, it's so good.Once you get used to the horror aspects of the game, you start to actually figure out how the game works. This game has a ridiculous amount of customization for you to choose from, but like the rest of the game you are limited in your resources and skill points(called cyber modules). I started out putting points into PSI and ended up using a lightsaber halfway through, using PSI to buff/amplify my melee skills. There are so many ways you can play, and I can easily see this game having a lot of replay value because of it. And without spoiling anything, the story is great. TL:DR - Fantastic game, 9/10 mostly because it is a little datedPROS-Amazing atmosphere-Great use of audio-Interesting story-Expansive and fun skill system, customizable-Great setting-SHODANCONS-Dated controls(fixable), UI takes a little bit to get used to-Mods make graphics pretty good, but some things like enemy models are still ugly(not a big deal though)- last minute or so is meh, was expecting an amazing ending after the rest of the game.Great game, highly recommend. This is almost a must play if you liked bioshock, because this game did almost everything bioshock did except earlier (though both games are great).			"

												System Shock 2 is the grandfather of modern FPS shooters. Despite it being quite underrated, System Shock 2 was the influence behind games like Bioshock and Half-Life. It is a dark and gritty game that combines a dark and scary atmosphere with surprisingly enjoyable exploration, crafting and research. As far as the story goes, you start out as a recruit and get to select your main path of game style. You have the Marines which will eventually allow you to get your hands on weapons ranging from pistols to grenade launchers and EMP rifles. You have the Navy, the ""tech"" class which makes it easier to hack machines and security systems. The last path is the OSA, which specialises in 'psi-powers' which allow you to use your mind to attack enemies, move items and objects from a distance and disable cameras. Afterwards, you are given a selection of three 'subpaths' which give you points in specific skills. Afterwards, you can level up your skills using cybermodules which are generally given to you as a reward for completing missions but you may find them in the world. Players are not restricted to the class they chose e.g those who picked the Marine path can invest their cybermodules in PSI powers. While a ""jack of all trades"" approach is tempting, it is best to stick to your chosen path because you may find it become incredibly expensive to maintain skill trees at the same time. When you're finished, the game begins. You find yourself onboard the Von Braun, a ship which has succumbed to a strange infection. All hell has broken loose and you must save yourself from the hybrids and other alien lifeforms, and from the psychotic Artificial Intelligence known as XERXES.The player can paint a picture of what happened to the Von Braun through collectibles, which are often recordings made by other crew members. Much like in Bioshock, they also may contain important passcodes and give away locations of important items. Through this method, following the story is optional and all those simply wanting to beat the game do not have to concentrate while a NPC goes on and on. (In this game, the only NPCs who talk to you are SHODAN and whatshernameagain.)System Shock 2 has some of the best level design I've ever seen, and some of the worst. Backtracking is one of the biggest issues this game has. While the levels are big and non-linear allowing for player freedom, they encourage backtracking. As you continue through the game, you are able to explore the Von Braun fully. An elevator located on every floor of the Von Braun allows you to return to an already explored floor (for the purposes of research, farming, healing etc.) What makes the level design superb is that it gives the player not only a sense of discovery and exploration, it also gives the player a sense of confusion and being lost. Some levels contain branches where you have to explore them, find an item and return to the main ""hub"" part to accomplish a mission to progress further. This does often lead to a sense of misdirection. This is something System Shock 2 does good. That being said, some levels basically have major chokeholds which don't allow the player to use different strategies if an enemy is blocking them. Every level contains security cameras monitored by the rogue AI XERXES. If it spots you, it will activate a security alarm which essentially sends a horde of enemies at you. It is always vital to watch your surroundings. Combat wise, the game offers a large arsenal of weaponry. Guns, grenade launchers, sabres and many more. Of course most weapons require a specific level in that particular skill line (e.g EMP Rifle requires an energy skill of 6.) As I mentioned earlier, the player is given the freedom to invest in the weapons skill tree even if they picked the Navy or OSA. Every weapon is degradable and you have to repair it if it becomes broken. While this degradable feature does make it substantially difficult for the player if they don't monitor their weapon's level of quality, it can be a bit annoying at times. The player can also modify their weapons using the modify skill, which basically increases the stats of that particular weapon. Combat aside, another unique feature of System Shock 2 is Research. On your journey, you may come across an item that is 'unresearched.' To research it, you require a table, and the required chemicals. To get these chemicals, you have to go to a chemical storeroom, which are located in almost every map. However, each chemical storeroom is not identical and you may to have to explore until you find the storeroom with the chemical you need. Upon researching an item, it will tell you what it does. For instance, some enemies may drop one of these items. If researched, it gives you a % damage boost against that particular enemy. While researching objects is an optional feature. It is best to invest in researching, as enemies later on do become difficult and the boost would help.Present in System Shock 2 is a hacking system, where you have to click on squares to create a line. Hacking is used to open crates, hack machines and disable security systems as well as terminating security alarms. System Shock 2 also offers a variety of enemies, ranging from psychic monkeys to annelid spiders and giant robots. As the game progresses, you have to face a growing variety of enemies. It does get incredibly difficult later on. Each encounter with enemies rests on the path you have chosen before. Marines can simply charge in, wreck the enemy and let that be the end of that. A Navyman can backtrack and find a way to avoid the enemy, and a OSA can use their PSI powers to stealthy kill the enemy. Enemies are generally randomly placed on the map, (apart from some pre-set robots.)Levels are not saturated in enemies, and there are times when the map can be empty. This gives the player plenty of freedom to explore, and makes each encounter with enemies unique. As the player progresses, enemy difficulty increases substantially. This difficulty can be eventually lowered through research. It does not matter what weapons you have, you will always be underpowered. You have to be incredibly observant of your surroundings, and this is something that System Shock 2 does very well.Present in this game is a co-op mode, which allows you to play with two other people! I strongly recommend that you finish System Shock 2 solo before playing co-op, because playing with a partner is a different experience. Knowing that you have backup deducts from the game's overall atmosphere. Co-op, although it is generally stable and bugfree, does contain some issues. (Not surprising for a game made in 1999.) I have encountered some bugs and glitches such as: unnoticable lag where automatic doors open for the host and not for the other players. The elevator can get stuck and won't change the level essentially trapping you (this can be fixed by all players restarting the game.) Enemies can [rarely] get stuck in their default model (aka 'mingebag' ) position and not do anything apart from making noise. A friend and I also encountered a glitch where NPCs would spawn in places they're not supposed to be. (We encountered some live crew member NPCs on one of the decks.) If playing co-op, i would save right before the SHODAN room (Most glitches tended to start after this scene in my case.) Apart from this, Co-op is fun to play with friends.On one final note, the atmosphere in this game is excellent in making the player feel weak and underpowered. While the game's music is topnotch quality, it doesn't always fit in with the feel of the game. Regardless, the dark, gritty and scary environments keep the player awake and observant. Just remember to keep in mind that this game was made in 1999 as the graphics have not aged well.System Shock 2 is a must-play for Halflife and Bioshock fans. It combines a range of unique aspects and abilities. it is an underrated yet enjoyable experience.			"

												This is one of those old school games I missed out on when I was younger and had no PC, so I just had to try it. I was not let down! Modern games still can't hold up against this and the amazing thing is that a modern day gamer can be impressed by a game that came out (17?) years ago. Let me break it down from a newcomers perspective. If you've played Bioshock, Deus ex or even Dead space, you will have an appreciation for SS2, in that it came before and you can see the influence of SS2 in many of these games. It's old, the graphics are dated but with some mods and a little bit of appreciation for ""antiques"", you'll be able to see how they don't make games like they used to. For me personally, the atmosphere is spot on, I was constantly on edge because you realise pretty soon into the game that enemies are a real threat, you die and there are penalties. Also, enemies are not pushovers, they're smart and they will hunt you down!You don't have unlimited recourses, if you stuff up an upgrade, you're stuck with it! Of course, reloading a saved game is a quick way out to correct something but playing the game like it was meant to be played, you get a real sense of ""survival horror"". My only gripe is that with the inventory being so small and having so many items in the game, management and usage of different weapons and items can be complex and a real struggle, which in a good way can add to the tension in a difficult situation.....but I'm too lazy to remember all of the hotkeys and keybindings to quick use lol.

												I played this game twice, one 2 years ago. Replayed this year.And i have to say. I'm Impressed!This game, is one of the hidden gems that you find rarely, that have all the things that match perfectly.I love it, not only for the style, that is actually my favorite one (Cyberpunk) but even for the gameplay itself.I cannot recommend this game to normal players AT ALL. It takes a lot of TIME and SWEAT to finish this one.And if you are here to search for an FPS, you are in the wrong place.System Shock 2 starts in a gigantic ship in the middle of the space that is actually attacked by something unknown.You do not remember anything. You wake up in a cryogenic bed, with everything destroyed and people everywhere that died.You HAVE to FIND a way out to put a end to it all.PROS:+ Fantastic Atmosphere+ RPG elements to upgrade and make yourself stronger+ Challenging. Hard even on Normal difficulty.+ Really INTERESTING Story+ Original + Awesome Mapping+ You can choose different classes (Heavy, Standard, Energy) and use different guns of every type+ The cost is REALLY low.CONS:- The ending is not one of the best ones. But it made me laugh a bit.- There's no CHECKPOINTS and AUTOSAVES. Only when you go from a room to the other. And quicksaves doesn't exist either.CONCLUSION:Vote 9.5/10This game, was a BIG adventure for me, and it's a really good for everyone that actually likes the type.I Suggest to EVERYONE that is reading this review to buy it immediately on FULL PRICE.Is a real MASTERPIECE of his genre and it values all the money you can spend on.Thanks for reading, Laguna's out.

												Highly recommend this game. The controls are excellent, the gameplay is great, and so is the plot. There are only two ""downsides"", 1) Graphics but what more do you want from a game that came out in 1999. 2) You have to actually think in this game. Also this game is very rewarding in how much you put into it.			"

												Damn good game.  The character graphics are a little dated, but the environment itself has aged spectacularly.  SHODAN is particularly memorable and the game hits a nice mix of horror, difficulty, and survivability.  There's a lot of the Bioshock series' gameplay in this (for those of you who played those before this), which makes sense since the people who made System Shock 2 went on to create the BIoshock games.  Some gore, but most of the horror will come from realizing that you have a particularly powerful enemy around the corner coming after you, and you just ran out of bullets.  Good luck!SS2 isn't easy, and it definitely is the kind of game where a screwup early on can indeed wreck your game later on.  It's perfectly possible to find yourself in a nearly unwinnable situation - don't waste ammunition, be sure to pick up ammo from everywhere you can, and learn to love the melee weapons.All in all, well worth the purchase price, and a classic.

This game should come with many clean pairs of pants - you will need them after playing in the dark with your headphones on.

												I've always loved this game, but I think that I appreciate System Shock 2 even more now than when I first played it. The game's tense and even frightening at times. The atmosphere is wonderfully realised and the audio still stands up as an example for modern developers to be inspired by. I think this is why I can appreciate the game so much more in 2013 than I did back when it originally came out, as its juxtaposition against modern games like the Bioshocks emphasize System Shock 2's accomplishments as even more groundbreaking than they once were. The only criticisms I have with playing it in 2013 are temporary criticisms. You'll first want to download a model replacer for npcs. The original low poly models now look a bit silly and clash with the experience the game intends to provide, so get a model replacer mod set up prior to playing. You'll also want to rebind the keys before playing, but it seems like there's an included preset that makes the game control like a modern fps, so switch to that. Make sure to play it with the lights off and the volume up.			"

												This game is a milestone. Something I have always held up as an example of excellence in game design.Though I played it nearly a decade after its release, it was still a far scarier and far more emotionally gripping experience than any ""horror"" game I have played to date. Its systems are statisfying, its world both varied and gratifying to explore, and for once in a game like this the resources you have the manage make the experience more engaging for how it's all balanced together.All of the character options are not necessarily balanced, and the finale isn't the best, but the narrative is stellar, the audio design blows a lot of modern games out of the water in many ways for what it accomplishes, and the game is just viscerally fun. You get a genuine rush beating an enemy to death with your wrench because you genuinely feel /threatened/. Something a lot of modern games have lost.If you are interested at all in game design, there is no reason you should not play this game.If you are NOT interested in game design, there is no reason you should not play this game.

												I did not play System Shock 2 until 2014, and have never played its namesake.System Shock 2 is not a good FPS. It was never designed to be a great FPS. It is an old game that shows many signs of age. The textures are dated. The models are dated.It is an old game.What then, makes me recommend System Shock 2? What is its relevance along technically advanced games of more modern times? It is the marriage of forgettable FPS and engaging RPG mechanics that surprise me. It is the interesting characters and fleshed out backstory that make me want to see it through. It is the complex level designs that show me attention to detail. All of these elements are reason why I review the title positively. SS2 was made before its time and yet its creation still influences games today. It is an important part of gaming as a whole and deserves to be looked at. If you can see past the age and the odd hitch, pick System Shock 2 up, tweak the controls, slap on a texture mod, and experience SHODAN.Please Consider: There are no mission arrows. The map can be unhelpful. Codes from audio logs must be typed manually.			"

												SS2 is a superb game, even if you slept on it and are new to the series in 2016, like me. The intriciate storytelling, immersive level design, and long length bring back memories from the golden age of PC gaming: late 90s. If you are looking for something on the scale of Half Life, but with a more scifi feel, this is the game for you. Off the bat I have to say yes, you have to play this game with graphical and gameplay mods. I would recommend installing them right away, because the vanilla game is almost 20 years old. However, the mods are very easy to install using BMM, its about as intuitive as the nexus mod manager. There is a good SS2 community online with a recommended mod setup. I followed their guidelines and the game looked great honestly. The best parts about the game:- Wonderful story with great voice acting and music. Once you start you have to finish.- With graphical overhaul mods the game looks pretty good and (energy) weapons are very stylish- In this day and age of AAA flops and DLC on disc, this game delivers great value. Grab it on sale and you're set. Some cons:- Honestly, I found the game difficult at first coming in with no background. Sometimes I had to use console. However, I was really engrossed by the story and it didn't bother me after a while- The combat is dated if you're coming from recent PC games. It's still fun but not mindblowing in any way. However it does hold up well, no doubt about it- Some of the menus have small printOverall a great game for the price. I think every gamer who appreciates a timeless story and wants to see the critical predecessors to modern RPG games should check this one out.			"

												First of all, any PC gamer worth his salt already knows this is a masterpiece of sci-fi horror FPSRPG, it's a beast of a game and a cult classic. If you didn't know, that should be enough to convince you, but let me re-iterate it's historical importance and worthiness.This is the game that not only inspired Bioshock, but everything else like it since (that includes anything from Fallout 3/NV to TES: Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim to Borderlands). Here's the basic formula: they took an FPS, added actual RPG elements, a real story, plus a horror atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi theme, and basically created a new genre. That's pretty significant, so if you've played Bioshock and haven't played this, you really should be ashamed of yourself... Fortunately for you, all hope is not lost as SS2 is now available on Steam and fixed to run on modern rigs so you may yet redeem yourself by playing it. Yay!A word of advice, though SS2 looks and sounds as old as it is, there are excellent texture/model/sound replacement mods available and they work fine with the Steam version. Despite all that, it still feels and plays better than most games of the genre today and remains a very special and highly memorable gaming experience nonetheless.Let me assure you that if I could have but one single wish answered by the Gods of Gaming it would be for a proper, actual sequel. But for some stupid reason, the license rights are of course tied up in limbo thanks to the absolutely rificulous bureaucratic state of the world, and so us poor gamers are left to suffer without it.Game like it was 1999!

												As much as I grew up with Looking Glass Studios (eg. the classic Thief trilogy), I never played the SS games until I got this.Now, I've played some scary games. For me the scariest were the Dead Space games (though, in all fairness, I've never gotten up the guts to play Amnesia or the other similar games). Second scariest for me were the Thief levels with those nearly unkillable zombies in them.However, SS2 is, I think, the scariest game I've ever tried to play. It doesn't even need good graphics. It achieves this with atmosphere, well-done audio effects, and pure survival gameplay (scavenging for food and rare ammo; keeping weapons fixed and working; etc.). I even still found it nerve-wrecking with cheats!Well-done. Very well-done.			"

												Wow. What a blast.I'm normally one to have difficulty reverting back to older games as each successive generation comes forward, but System Shock 2 is such a solid game that it betrays hardly any hint of its age (15 years!). I happened to buy it when it was only 99 cents (90% off), and I can say I would easily pay the full $9.99 for an experience like this. I was totally blown away by virtually every aspect of it: the presentation, the story, the RPG mechanics, the action, the intricacy of the environments—even the music.The only gripe I have, after playing through the whole game once, is that managing the inventory can be quite frustrating. It really isn't very well designed.That's it, really. I can't recommend a game more.			"

 System Shock 2 REVIEWAn old cult classic from '99 which is still popular and being tweaked with mods as I write this review. Whats to love about this game? The audiologs and level design are used in the narrative pretty well. The character Shodan is a very interesting enigma. The graphic style, especially with mods really pops sometimes. But the only amazing thing I guess is that uncomfortable atmosphere sytsem shock has. Shodans voice, distressed journal entries, moaning hybrids add a constant feeling of desolation. But that kind of where the buck stops for this game. Well the combat is alright I mean its challenging in a old trial and error way. But the story ending just left a lot to be wished for.			"

												I did not expect a game from 1999 to be very scary. I mean, the engine couldn't be too powerful, how scary could they make it?Very.Many games come with the recommendation ""take a break between every hour of play"", but this is the only game where I've actually done that. Although this game does have the occasional jump scare (turning a corner in to a previously empty hall and there's a monster RIGHT THERE), most of the terror is of the slow, suspenseful kind, where you're sitting on the edge of your seat, are quietly mumbling ""moommmyyy"" and wish that blasted light in your ceiling fan didn't flicker ominously.This game has aged wonderfully, and is well worth the price - especially if you can pick it up on a sale!However, there are some caveats. There are five kinds of people that should not get this game:1: Graphics snobs. This is an old game. Don't go in to it expecting Crysis.2: People with weak hearts.3: People that like being able to sleep at night.4: Small children (This should be self explanatory, but y' never know.)5: People absolutely incapable of forward planning. No respecs in this game (Although it does allow for save-scumming if you feel like it.)If you don't fall under those categories, and you like the idea of scrambling for survival in a spaceship infested with horrors-that-cannot-be-more-specifically-described-because-it-would-ruin-the-plot, then get this game.Or put it on your wishlist and wait for a Sale. You already have a huge backlog of games already (we all do!), and this game gets massively discounted during Steam Sales. "

												Here's a brief FAQ on System Shock 2 for 2014 gamers- It's 2014, should I still play this game from 1999?- Yes. HOLY MONKEY BALLS, YES!- But the graphics look crappy!- Never judge a game by its graphics, as the old saying goes. Once you're immersed in the story and fantastic atmosphere of SS2, you'll forget about pixelated textures and low-poly models. Moreover, the music and awesome voicework will give you goosebumps on more than one occasion.- But the game is so hard!- I know, right? Even on Normal difficulty it's no walk in the park. Welcome to the cruel world of scarce resources, respawnable monsters, and mutually exclusive game choices. You will have to get familiar with the game's rich mechanics. You will have to pay attention to briefings and logs. There won't be objective pointers to guide you. All of this makes finishing the game much more rewarding.			"

												Oldie, but a damn fine goodie.Very suspenseful, creative interface and gameplay mechanics.Sure, its a shooter, but there's things in this game that RPG and FPS makers STILL have a hard time implementing.Case in point- a map that you can annotate yourself.  Had to leave something behind, but still want it for later?  MARK IT ON THE MAP.   Had to leave a stash of chemicals due to lack of inventory space?  MARK IT ON THE MAP.  Saw something nopeworthy but might have the courage to face later?  MARK IT ON THAT MAP BRO.Also, there are mods that make this game look a fair bit better- but then again if you can enjoy Half Life 1 for all its ingenuity and glory; you can play this no problem.Fun fact: These guys made the Bioshock series after this, keep that in mind when you play it and wonder where some of these features went when they made Bioshock.

The logs we pick up tell the story of the crew, these are fantastic at giving us pieces of the story and helping us learn the fate of the crew.The game is not easy at all, you have to learn how to use PSI, repair weapons, reaserch objects, simply put one of the best games I have ever played, holds up really well after 16 years.

												As a game from 1999, I have to say this is classic. The playstyle is great, the gameplay is smooth, and everything about it is what i want in a first person shooter. It's an RPG style game, with a great storyline and atmosphere. After playing this game all the way through i can tell that a lot of games, like dead space, got their ideas from the story of System Shock 2. The game is about a ship that gets overrun by a virus, turning all of its population into zombie-like creatures, like dead space. The protagonist of the story is led the the entire ship, starting at med bay, going through engineering and hydroponics, all the way up to the command deck, like dead space. I'm not ragging on dead space, i love the game, i just thought it was funny to play through and see how game dev's got the idea. Overall this game was brilliant, and had me hooked for days up until i beat it. The game is replayable, as you can choose which playstyle you like, ranging from guns blazing to cybernetic powers. 9/10			"

												Hardcore and very old school. If you need someone to hold your hand... look elsewhere. This is what games used to be like back in the days before they all got hit by the stupid-stick and the easy-mode-club. Hard, fun and huge. If you scew up you die. If you drop quest-items before you've used them (like the sim cards) you have to run around looking for them. Nothing is for free. Ammo is sparse, enemies are hard and there is plenty of them. You really have to plan ahead, listen to the sounds of what's running around, watch out for the towers and the cameras, aim carefully. I love it :)  You will die alot...alot. You will rage-quit... But you will come back again and again because you want to beat the game. It will take you an hour or so to get used to the interface... but don't give up. This game is a jewel.I recommend that you Install a graphic-mod to fix the rather dull original textures and ""monster"" models.			"

												I've always loved this game, but I think that I appreciate System Shock 2 even more now than when I first played it. The game's tense and even frightening at times. The atmosphere is wonderfully realised and the audio still stands up as an example for modern developers to be inspired by. I think this is why I can appreciate the game so much more in 2013 than I did back when it originally came out, as its juxtaposition against modern games like the Bioshocks emphasize System Shock 2's accomplishments as even more groundbreaking than they once were. The only criticisms I have with playing it in 2013 are temporary criticisms. You'll first want to download a model replacer for npcs. The original low poly models now look a bit silly and clash with the experience the game intends to provide, so get a model replacer mod set up prior to playing. You'll also want to rebind the keys before playing, but it seems like there's an included preset that makes the game control like a modern fps, so switch to that. Make sure to play it with the lights off and the volume up.			"

												This game is a milestone. Something I have always held up as an example of excellence in game design.Though I played it nearly a decade after its release, it was still a far scarier and far more emotionally gripping experience than any ""horror"" game I have played to date. Its systems are statisfying, its world both varied and gratifying to explore, and for once in a game like this the resources you have the manage make the experience more engaging for how it's all balanced together.All of the character options are not necessarily balanced, and the finale isn't the best, but the narrative is stellar, the audio design blows a lot of modern games out of the water in many ways for what it accomplishes, and the game is just viscerally fun. You get a genuine rush beating an enemy to death with your wrench because you genuinely feel /threatened/. Something a lot of modern games have lost.If you are interested at all in game design, there is no reason you should not play this game.If you are NOT interested in game design, there is no reason you should not play this game.

												Wow. What a blast.I'm normally one to have difficulty reverting back to older games as each successive generation comes forward, but System Shock 2 is such a solid game that it betrays hardly any hint of its age (15 years!). I happened to buy it when it was only 99 cents (90% off), and I can say I would easily pay the full $9.99 for an experience like this. I was totally blown away by virtually every aspect of it: the presentation, the story, the RPG mechanics, the action, the intricacy of the environments—even the music.The only gripe I have, after playing through the whole game once, is that managing the inventory can be quite frustrating. It really isn't very well designed.That's it, really. I can't recommend a game more.			"

 System Shock 2 REVIEWAn old cult classic from '99 which is still popular and being tweaked with mods as I write this review. Whats to love about this game? The audiologs and level design are used in the narrative pretty well. The character Shodan is a very interesting enigma. The graphic style, especially with mods really pops sometimes. But the only amazing thing I guess is that uncomfortable atmosphere sytsem shock has. Shodans voice, distressed journal entries, moaning hybrids add a constant feeling of desolation. But that kind of where the buck stops for this game. Well the combat is alright I mean its challenging in a old trial and error way. But the story ending just left a lot to be wished for.			"

												As much as I grew up with Looking Glass Studios (eg. the classic Thief trilogy), I never played the SS games until I got this.Now, I've played some scary games. For me the scariest were the Dead Space games (though, in all fairness, I've never gotten up the guts to play Amnesia or the other similar games). Second scariest for me were the Thief levels with those nearly unkillable zombies in them.However, SS2 is, I think, the scariest game I've ever tried to play. It doesn't even need good graphics. It achieves this with atmosphere, well-done audio effects, and pure survival gameplay (scavenging for food and rare ammo; keeping weapons fixed and working; etc.). I even still found it nerve-wrecking with cheats!Well-done. Very well-done.			"

												I did not expect a game from 1999 to be very scary. I mean, the engine couldn't be too powerful, how scary could they make it?Very.Many games come with the recommendation ""take a break between every hour of play"", but this is the only game where I've actually done that. Although this game does have the occasional jump scare (turning a corner in to a previously empty hall and there's a monster RIGHT THERE), most of the terror is of the slow, suspenseful kind, where you're sitting on the edge of your seat, are quietly mumbling ""moommmyyy"" and wish that blasted light in your ceiling fan didn't flicker ominously.This game has aged wonderfully, and is well worth the price - especially if you can pick it up on a sale!However, there are some caveats. There are five kinds of people that should not get this game:1: Graphics snobs. This is an old game. Don't go in to it expecting Crysis.2: People with weak hearts.3: People that like being able to sleep at night.4: Small children (This should be self explanatory, but y' never know.)5: People absolutely incapable of forward planning. No respecs in this game (Although it does allow for save-scumming if you feel like it.)If you don't fall under those categories, and you like the idea of scrambling for survival in a spaceship infested with horrors-that-cannot-be-more-specifically-described-because-it-would-ruin-the-plot, then get this game.Or put it on your wishlist and wait for a Sale. You already have a huge backlog of games already (we all do!), and this game gets massively discounted during Steam Sales. "

												Here's a brief FAQ on System Shock 2 for 2014 gamers- It's 2014, should I still play this game from 1999?- Yes. HOLY MONKEY BALLS, YES!- But the graphics look crappy!- Never judge a game by its graphics, as the old saying goes. Once you're immersed in the story and fantastic atmosphere of SS2, you'll forget about pixelated textures and low-poly models. Moreover, the music and awesome voicework will give you goosebumps on more than one occasion.- But the game is so hard!- I know, right? Even on Normal difficulty it's no walk in the park. Welcome to the cruel world of scarce resources, respawnable monsters, and mutually exclusive game choices. You will have to get familiar with the game's rich mechanics. You will have to pay attention to briefings and logs. There won't be objective pointers to guide you. All of this makes finishing the game much more rewarding.			"

												An amazing game that challenges you, forces you to explore, listen to audio logs and tune yourself to fight the creatures inside the U.N.N. Rickenbacker and Von Braun, known as 'The Many'. A truly amazing game that is still really fun to play even though the graphics are a bit dated.There are 3 branches of Service to go into at the start of the game. The Marines the Navy and the OSA. The Marines are tailored towards heavy, energy and standard weapons to make the most use out of those, while at the same time be a walking tank.The Navy lets you get more technical skills such as being able to hack into computer systems or replicators, and let you research objects in the game to expose the weaknessess of your enemies and discover exotic alien weapons, armor and implants.The OSA are tailored around Psionic disciplines which let you use an amplifier to shoot out large balls of energy at your enemies, increase your resistance to damage and heal yourself among other abilities.Don't like horror games? It's fine. This is an Action RPG with horror elements rather than a horror game with rpg and action elements. Still scared? The game has a fully functioning cooperative mode to play through the campaign with up to 2 friends. Here's a quick guide to setup multiplayer

												What is it with Sci Fi Horror set in space and Hydroponics deck being the most terrifying thing in the entire game? I don't know how, but this game, despite the fact that it hasn't aged well at all in the graphics department, creates such an amazing atmosphere and really sets the tone in an exemplary way. You play a guy with absolutely no fashion sense (jumpsuit and cybernetically implanted goggles make him look like Adam Jensen going through his goth phase) on his quest to find out just what went wrong on the Von Braun, which has seemingly been taken over by worm people and overly friendly robots who blow up in your face, spoiler alert. Despite the sometimes dodgy voice acting and the pretty awful movement controls (in my opinion, but then again almost all games from this period controlled like ♥♥♥♥), this game is a great RPG, and one of the few in recent memory that has a fairly rich and detailed mythos embedded into the game itself. We don't get enough good Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk Action RPG's, in my opinion, and despite the fact that this is a precursor to this genre, it is still one of the best in terms of atmosphere, story and world building. I heartily reccomend this game to any fans of the genre. Speaking as a person who doesn't have nostalgia goggles on (many people seem to in the review section, and with good reason), I can safely say that this game still holds up in quite a few respects all these years on. Notstalgia usually makes people think of something that may have been ok-ish as the best thing since sliced bread, but what happens when it is something truly great for its time?			"

												As filthy, casual gamer scum, I played the Bioshock games before this one.This kind of makes them look like baby's-first action RPG. I mean, this one even has a manageable inventory, and it's like thirty years old.It also makes me realize that Dead Space, while a fun Resident Evil 4 romp, had absolutely no original ideas and blatantly ripped System Shock off.People harp on this game's brutality, but I think they're exaggerating. If you're the type that snubs his nose at Dead Space and Bioshock, you'll feel right at home here. Being careful with ammo and resources and the constant threat of levels you've cleared magically refilling with horrible, horrible hybrids, it's what those games wanted to do but were too busy being accessible....But the big daddy fights in the first Bioshock were cool. There's not much of that in this, but whatever. "

												I'll start with the things this game got wrong. Most games like this with skill trees/points in particular are bad about forcing you to min-max and this one is no exception. If anything it's worse than most other games from the same era cause you can literally make the game un-winnable if you don't know what stats you need and don't. The psionic abilities and weapons are also horribly inbalanced against themselves, have to knock off points for that since there's a fair amount of combat in this game.Those complaints aside this one is incredibly atmospheric, far more than any Bioshock game was ever able to achieve. The limitations of the engine create a crushing sense of isolation and the only contact you have being with entities that cannot be trusted further add to the lingering sense of dread.Flaws and all, this is still a game worth experiencing. Definitely worth checking out.			"

												System Shock 2 is a game I only looked into because I was such a big fan of the Bioshock series. This was one of Ken Levine's first big project's, and I almost love it as much as Bioshock. The story and setting are superb, and the semi-linear gameplay is perfectly excecuted. It's only downsides are it's dated graphics, odd controls, some gameplay annoyances, and trash ending. Additionally, this is more of an RPG than Bioshock is as it has very well thought out skill trees. It is important that you choose what you upgrade carefully, as the game is also suprisingly difficult at times. My main complaints of the game, and also why I personally prefer Bioshock, are the weapon degredation system and the confusing interface.The weapon degredation system appears to be hastily implemented and is less well thought out than Fallout's own. Also, the tutorial is quite bad, and the enemy AI isn't done too well. Overall, I liked the RPG elements a lot, but I think Bioshock did a good thing by cutting out a lot of the extraneous and tedious gameplay mechanics. However, if Bioshock had a more expansive RPG tree system and maybe some better inventory management, then it would be simply the best.			"

												Wow. What a blast.I'm normally one to have difficulty reverting back to older games as each successive generation comes forward, but System Shock 2 is such a solid game that it betrays hardly any hint of its age (15 years!). I happened to buy it when it was only 99 cents (90% off), and I can say I would easily pay the full $9.99 for an experience like this. I was totally blown away by virtually every aspect of it: the presentation, the story, the RPG mechanics, the action, the intricacy of the environments—even the music.The only gripe I have, after playing through the whole game once, is that managing the inventory can be quite frustrating. It really isn't very well designed.That's it, really. I can't recommend a game more.			"

												I am torn on whether to recommend System Shock 2.  It was a famously good game at the time of its release in 1999.  It laid much of the foundation for the BioShock games.  Its malevolent AI, SHODAN, is a clear inspiration for GLaDOS.  It blends RPG and FPS elements in a way that was unequalled at the time, and would remain so until the release of Deus Ex a year later.All that being said, however System Shock 2 does not carry its age well.  Much of what it did so well at the time has since been eclipsed by more recent titles, which makes its flaws more evident.  The most notable way in which time has betrayed System Shock 2 lies in the graphics.  The game's abandoned-spaceship setting was eerie and atmospheric at the time, but now seems only boxy and retro, as it prompts instant comparisons to the similarly-set Dead Space series, against which the older graphics can't measure up.  Since it no longer meets, or even approaches the current standard for ""realism"" in a video-game environment, it loses the immersiveness necessary to make the horror aspects of the game compelling.  Similarly, what was a slick and functional UI system in 1999 feels rather clunky and clumsy in 2015.  Other issues, which were noted, but seemed less significant at the time, become more prominent now that the brilliance of the game has been dulled by our elevated expectations.For the video-game afficionado, I'd recommend buying this game purely for the historical significance of it.  Unfortunately, the tarnish of age means that, if you haven't experienced it before, it's now not truly possible to experience playing System Shock 2 the way it felt to play it at the time.  But you can still appreciate it as an artifact.			"

												Quite simply this game is a cult classic, which started the genre, if you want a really graphically impressive game then this is somewhat dated for you.  However, if you're after something with a good story, well thought out gameplay, with nothing too complicated in the way of puzzles, the this is it!There's plenty of options for your plan of survival. There's loads of scary moments to be had too! You can be drawn into a situation where you're literally scared stiff with your 2 health, no ranged weapons, and just a melee weapon to get you to the next nanite pickup!All in all I love this game, with the mods the story expands, you'll get a lot of gameplay out of this game!

												Pretty fun old first person shooter RPG with horror elements. One might say that the Bioshocks are a watered down (pun intended) version of this game. This game is also really difficult on normal and up, which is why I don't have many hours put into it. Overall an 8/10.			"

												If you haven't heard of System Shock 2, well, it's the game that was so gripping and fantastic that it secretly got remade as another gripping and fantastic game, Bioshock.Now this game, System Shock 2, it's a doozy. I could recommend it solely because of the atmosphere it drapes over you. It's the only game I've played that actually reached in through my eye sockets, curled its wires around my spine, and really, truly made me feel powerless. Imagine, if you can, my situation. I am trapped, trapped inside the twisting bowels of a vast machine, with just a little space to move around. And the more I move around, the more I realize, I am tangled in two machines - one of flesh, the other of hissing steel. A voice is guiding me, helping me, but it's just a voice. And as I wrench myself free from deep within this machine, violently stumbling out of the clutches of one chamber and into another, always the steel is watching from my front, and the flesh is grabbing at my heels.I am never allowed to forget that between my scampering body and the dead vacuum of space lies a thin layer of aluminium and glass.This game is not a cake-walk - it's a tough journey and a tough experience. If you like horror, you HAVE TO experience System Shock 2, the acme of the genre. There are a few brilliant moments in the game that made my brain drop whatever it was doing and just kind of kick and whimper. I recall saying things like ""Ga! It can't, wait, how? Oh hell, what?? No!"" (And I'm a pretty jaded guy.) Some of these moments are big, others are small enough to miss for a while - and then, when they do hit, they hit really, really hard. It's just brilliant, singularly brilliant.Even with the horror that is the graphical technology of 1999, the visuals in SS2 do a fantastic job. The NPC models are blurry by today's standards, but somehow so disturbing that they never lose their impact. The dying spaceship you're on is a masterpiece of design: corpses and debris are meaningfully scattered, each piece telling an aching story. The stellar sound design (by far, by far, the best I've encountered in any game) begs to be experienced. A sprawling RPG skillset and intrigueing sets of tools and weapons let you survive in any number of ways, all of them challenging.I recommend playing the original System Shock first (the enhanced edition with all the sounds); it's not essential, but will give you a little more context and back-story. It is definitely worth playing just to experience the first chapter of what I think is the best villain in a video game. SS2 does a great job of painting the full picture, though.I could host a week-long seminar about the great things this game achieves, but the truth is, you should simply experience it for yourself. Get the game now, and try to play it as coninuously as you can to avoid fragmenting the experience.			"

												A Classic Game I highly recommend. System Shock 2's game play is something I've rarely encountered to the same level of execution in games of that era or in fact the current era of games.  You can see echos of this game in more recent games that have varying degree of influence and pay homage (some even feeling like alternative universion versoin of system shock 2).Perhaps one of the more refreashing aspects is that it is a sequal that both seamlessly transitions from the prior entry  while at the same time not expecting you or requiring you to have played the prior entry. The game allows you to create a specialized and dynamic character. Grab your trusty Wrench and set forth on a well written and classic sci-fi adventer.			"

												Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios were really hitting their stride in the late 1990s when it came to first person games. In the last two years of the 1990s, they redefined the stealth genre and came up with this lovely FPS-RPG hybrid, the sequel to System Shock. Featuring two really creepy antagonists, a wealth of mechanics, and the freedom to play how you want, it was hailed as a game that defied genre classification and considered to be quite ahead of its time. It's not without its flaws, however. It turns blisteringly hard towards the end if you don't develop your character strictly within one class and it doesn't quite send the message that you need to conserve your ammo. This new release by Night Dive Studios allows the game to run on modern computers and it keeps mod functionality as well. If you like first person roleplaying games, there has never been a better time than now to discover or relive this classic. That's how much I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, now buy it.			"

												This is a very interesting horror-themed first person shooter. Yes, it came out way back in 1999, so the graphics are dated by today's standards. I finally got around to playing it because the highly entertaining Bioshock series was made by the same guy, Ken Levine. I also remember playing and enjoying System Shock 1 many years ago so nostalgia had something to do with it. The intro to System Shock 2 tells you what happened in the previous game, though, so don't feel you need to play the original to enjoy the sequel.So, despite the dated graphics, is it still scary and/or fun? Hells YES, on both counts! I'll give an example of the scariness/awesomeness:You're trapped on a spaceship that has been taken over by hostile aliens. The aliens also control the ship's computer system, so the ship's normally helpful steward robots have now become automated suicide bombers. They will walk up to you and self destruct, usually while spouting some cheery greeting or friendly banter. As part of your travels you have to go through a darkened cargo bay with crates stacked everywhere and many tight spaces. I got to the middle of the cargo bay before I realized that all the crates around me were storage crates for the suicide steward robots, and that all the crates said ""READY"" on them in big green letters. Sure enough, as soon as I turn my back on the crates I hear the sound of them breaking open, and a horde of robots is coming right at me, giving me friendly greetings all the while! Talk about a mixture of shock, horror, and excitement!!!The game has strong RPG elements. At the start you are given the choice of being a combat oriented Marine, a technical oriented Naval Ops guy, or a Psionic Operative -- basically a high tech Jedi or wizard or whatever you want to call it. You're given a large amount of different skills to choose from, but you'll only have enough skill points to master a few so you have to choose wisely.The large number of skills and items means you have many options for defeating the obstacles in your path. Is a big mean security bot ruining your day? Use your psi powers to turn invisible and walk past him. Or switch to armor piercing bullets to destroy him. Or hack a security turret to open fire on your enemy.There are many mini-games that come with System Shock 2. You'll get a ""GamePig"" fairly early on that will let you play games completely unrelated to the main plot, everything from Tic Tac Toe to a racing game to an Ultima clone! Hells yeah!But not everything is good about System Shock 2.For one thing the game has a steep learning curve, and it is very difficult. Even a single enemy can kill you without too much trouble, and even when you're doing well you're always short of resources. This goes along with the survival horror theme but it can be frustrating at times. I'm a veteran first person shooter player, but after a few hours of getting slaughtered on ""Normal"" difficulty I had to swallow my pride and restart on ""Easy.""Another gripe I had was the inventory management system was annoying. You'll quickly run out of space, and the only way to get more space is to spend precious skill upgrade points on Strength, a skill of otherwise dubious usefulness. And even after I maxed out my Strength score I was still running out of space! Argh!As for the plot, it was nine kinds of awesome. There are several plot twists and I don't want to be too spoilerish, but I will say that the climactic finale of the game was a crowning moment of awesome. I only wish that more games had this kind of emphasis on storytelling.So System Shock 2 is a flawed game, yes, but it's worth looking past the flaws because in the end you'll find a hidden gem. If you like Bioshock, Deus Ex, or survival horror games you owe it to yourself to check out System Shock 2.			"

												An atmospheric, riveting mish-mash of role-playing, first-person shooter, adventure, survival horror, and puzzle solving that stands the test of time. Lost in cyberspace, as if it were a case of irony, for the longest time, its resurrection as a legally downloadable title will certainly help to get more players aquainted with the game that essentially spearheaded its spiritual successor, BioShock. Indeed, you'll find that BioShock, with a few liberties of course, plays almost exactly like System Shock 2. It has a very similar plot structure, also has its own set of abilities crafted for its game world, and that oh so infamous twist. System Shock 2 is a challenging affair, however, but not always for the right reasons. While it certainly doesn't hold your hand like BioShock did with the Vita Chambers, it's honestly not far behind with the reconstruction nodes (or whatever they're called in SS2). The primary weakness in SS2 lies in its array of Psi abilities, which are drastically unbalanced and rather poorly conceived, compounded even further by the atrocious costs to acquire them whilst you should instead focus on more pressing skills and traits (such as weapon requirements and statistics upgrades). Weapons jam far too quickly. Enemies can respawn and it sometimes breaks the immersion. Controls are not silky smooth, but this is more a double-edged sword that also presents a necessary challenge that may help you appreciate the game's trials. And the graphics, in retrospect, are rather ugly, particularly with regards to character models and the innumerous FMV sequences (yeah, I used a term that has seemingly disappeared from the gaming pantheon).Stealth is, rather, sketchy in the game as well. Some of the enemies seem to possess Heimdall-esque sensory abilities at times while at others they're completely oblivious to your adjacent presence. Either occurrence can take place while you play stealthily (walking instead of running, moving around in a crouch, no firing of weaponry, etc.), so there's some inconsistent AI present. There are useful features in the game, however, such as modifying weaponry without strained limitations like its spiritual successor, being able to climb ledges and other obstacles, priming a melee weapon for a timed strike rather than swinging about like a dunce, and a full-fledged inventory system. You can also change the kind of armor you wear, and you can equip a trait-enhancing implant (two with a particular OS upgrade). Cybernetic Modules are more valuable and come in lesser quantities than ADAM from BioShock, and thus you come to appreciate acquiring them in this go-ahead. The aforementioned flaw in the Psi abilities wherein lies most of the abilities (5 pages of them, costing up to 50 modules just to unlock) doesn't help matters and may cause players to find themselves in an unnecessarily unfair circumstance later in gameplay, but at this point this flaw is common knowledge so one should be able to avoid it with a simple treading of actual reviews.Anyway, the power of this game lies in the atmosphere, characters & monsters, and setting. You are, really, quite utterly alone on the enigmatic Von Braun, and everything is out to get you. When you think there's hope, it immediately gets dashed. You must adapt to survive, or you just won't cut it. You have to strategize, and as you interact with the interfacing systems of the Von Braun and the accompanying Rickenbacker, you're defenseless and in real-time. You have to seek out the only means of avoiding the dreaded ""back to menu"" incident as a result of untimely death, which may very well happen within mere seconds of facing opposition or even harsh environmental conditions. You have to listen to the sounds of your surroundings or pay the price for carelessness. Common enemies, which are infected former crew-members, hunt you down mercilessly but apologize to you for it or beg for you to take them out of their misery. What were once simple robots built for the express purpose of undertaking menial tasks are now unwitting kamikaze units. Alien-esque creatures appear more numerous the further into the ship you venture, assaulting you from all sides. Former defense droids that kept the peace and maintained safety for the crew do everything but those things when you're around, and will cut your life short upon detection. And all you have are rather measly (at first) weapons, limited and costly ammunition to attack with, armor that slightly reduces damage at all, and on top of all that, a very mortal existence. You're on the bottom of the food chain here, you're no John Rambo, and most of all, time is running out. That doesn't take into account the sometimes absurdly dangerous environment and its contents!In the end, it is a remarkable title that deserves to be played, especially by fans of 2007's BioShock. You may even manage an ounce of appreciation for System Shock 2, and for the diabolical, megalomaniacal villain SHODAN whom adorns its cover image and just about any discussion regarding the game. You may even quiver in fear as you go about its challenges, which is always a plus.			"

Talk about a mixture of shock, horror, and excitement!!!The game has strong RPG elements. At the start you are given the choice of being a combat oriented Marine, a technical oriented Naval Ops guy, or a Psionic Operative -- basically a high tech Jedi or wizard or whatever you want to call it. You're given a large amount of different skills to choose from, but you'll only have enough skill points to master a few so you have to choose wisely.The large number of skills and items means you have many options for defeating the obstacles in your path. Is a big mean security bot ruining your day? Use your psi powers to turn invisible and walk past him. Or switch to armor piercing bullets to destroy him. Or hack a security turret to open fire on your enemy.There are many mini-games that come with System Shock 2. You'll get a ""GamePig"" fairly early on that will let you play games completely unrelated to the main plot, everything from Tic Tac Toe to a racing game to an Ultima clone! Hells yeah!But not everything is good about System Shock 2.For one thing the game has a steep learning curve, and it is very difficult. Even a single enemy can kill you without too much trouble, and even when you're doing well you're always short of resources. This goes along with the survival horror theme but it can be frustrating at times. I'm a veteran first person shooter player, but after a few hours of getting slaughtered on ""Normal"" difficulty I had to swallow my pride and restart on ""Easy.""Another gripe I had was the inventory management system was annoying. You'll quickly run out of space, and the only way to get more space is to spend precious skill upgrade points on Strength, a skill of otherwise dubious usefulness. And even after I maxed out my Strength score I was still running out of space! Argh!As for the plot, it was nine kinds of awesome. There are several plot twists and I don't want to be too spoilerish, but I will say that the climactic finale of the game was a crowning moment of awesome. I only wish that more games had this kind of emphasis on storytelling.So System Shock 2 is a flawed game, yes, but it's worth looking past the flaws because in the end you'll find a hidden gem. If you like Bioshock, Deus Ex, or survival horror games you owe it to yourself to check out System Shock 2.			"

												Where do I start? System Shock 2 is a game that didn't deserve the reaction (or lack thereof) it received  upon its maiden voyage back in the cold, dark year of 1999. From what little I know of, and what little I've played, I would consider it a superior game to Half-Life, and Half-Life 2 (gasp!). Sure, its age shows, and is literally harder than diamonds, but overall it is an experience NO ONE should miss.PROSAtmosphere (In space? Really?)SHODANInspired BioshockCONSA little confusing			"

												As one of the all time survival horror classics, System Shock 2 has been on the top of my to-do list for a while.  Now that I've finally finished the game I've been telling myself to play since 2007, here's my thoughts:Story: The story was very well done, and it shows how much it's influenced future games of its type, like Bioshock and Dead Space.  The basics are simple enough: you wake up on board a starship with amnesia, and someone starts barking orders into your ear while you're attacked by mutants with wrenches.  Not the most inspired start by today's standards, but what really gets the story moving are logs from other people on the ship.  These recording from before and during the attack build a large world around you (as large as you can get on a spaceship), with other characters carrying out their own subplots around you.  Some of the lines can be a bit narmy, but it's kind of saddening when you find a log from a character you've been hearing of for the past couple levels, only for it to be a recording of their last moments.The active plot is wonderful as well.  SHODAN being the main villian has been spoiled since the original box art in 1999, but the build up to the reveal is quite well done, both in story and atmosphere.  The story about The Many is superb as well, and everything is wrapped up in a satisfying ending.  That's not counting the final boss fight, of course, but I'll get to that in a minute.All in all, there's nothing to complain about here.  A very well told story from start to finish.Sound: I'll split this section off into a couple different sections.  The overall sound direction is great: there's a lot of little ambient sounds that add to the atmosphere, and hearing security bots and mutants in the distance makes the game feel very tense.  You'll get a couple jumpscares, too, with unexpected explosions here and there as the ship degrades.The actual music in the game is excellent, but some of it doesn't quite fit for it.  On the very first level Med/Sci, you're treated to an energetic techo beat that seems more conductive to running & gunning, like something out of Unreal Tournament.  But, at that point, all you have to your name is a wrench and (maybe) low level Psi powers, so a run & gun style is just going to get your head bashed in with a pipe wrench.  It gets much better after that, however, with tracks that really keep you on edge.The voice acting is, to put it nicely, really over the place.  The lead character is mute (save for 1 line at the end of the game), so all of the voice work is done by the supporting characters.  SHODAN and The Many sound great, with SHODAN being a standout performance.  Some of the enemies (like the mutant hybrids) are good, too, and can cause some jump scares hearing their distorted voices coming up fast behind you.  The rest of the cast and logs range from ""great"" to ""hobo they pulled off the street, and are paying with vodka & cigarettes"".  Some of the voice acting just...wasn't convincing at all.Graphics: I won't touch too much on the graphics, considering the age of the game.  It looks great for the time it came out in, looking a lot like Half Life, Thief and the above mentioned Unreal.  The level design was outstanding as well: I never found myself getting lost, and the setup of the ship makes as much sense as a starship would make.  A special note goes to the final two levels of the game in terms of level design, but I don't want to spoil to much here.  Gameplay: the gameplay is just as polarizing as the sound direction is.  The core gameplay is a pretty functional FPS, with some platforming in a few places.  There's some RPG elements in the form of 'Cyber Modules' that you earn by completing plot related objectives, as well as by looking in some hard to reach places.  These Cyber Modules can be used to upgrade profeciency with weapons and tech related things (such as Repair and Hacking), increase your base stats, or unlock psionic abilities.  It's a pretty neat twist to the Fighter-Mage-Thief setup that many RPG's use.  The game gives you a lot to choose from, and no two characters are going to have the same build (unless you're reading from a guide or something).However, these same RPG elements are one of the core failings of the game.  The above mentioned weapons you can train in are horribly imbalanced: some weapon classes are much better than the others, and picking the wrong build (or running out of specific ammo near the end) can render the game completely unwinnable.  It's especially apparent in the final levels of the game: the second to last level renders an entire set of weapons useless, while the final level renders another set of weapons (one that was good against the enemies in the previous level) equally worthless.  If you relied on only one of these sets of weapons during the game, then time to restart!  This is more likely to happen on Impossible difficulty, however: Easy and Normal give you more than enough modules to modify your build if you notice anything wrong, and even Hard is pretty generous with them once you're on deck 3/4.The RPG elements also add some replay value to the game.  While I completed the game with a lot of Tech and Standard Weapons training, I may do a 2nd playthrough as a completely Psionic character next.  The difficulty also spikes the higher you go, and I'm honestly dreading trying up the game on Impossible.Overall: An extremely well told story and some legitimate scares, woven into a functional yet flawed FPSRPG.  If you're considering this game, the biggest question to ask yourself is this: can you stomach 'meh' gameplay for a great story?  If so, I highly recommend this game.  But, I can freely admit it's not everyone: feel free to stay away if you're not into survival horror games, or if you like your FPS's feeling a bit less 'broken'.			"

												I bought this game in 1999 back when I was 11 years old, though I finally got the stones to fully make my way through the game when I was 17. I quit the game from fright several times, but kept coming back because I was determined to beat the terrors of the Von Braun. Since then I have returned to the game many times just so I could soak in the atmosphere of the game and face the evils from Tau Ceti V once again.System Shock 2 is a cyberpunk first person shooter with a good chunk of RPG elements. Elements such as inventory management, stats and different builds, and choices that affect your progress forward. There are also a survival aspect, it becoming more pronounced on the higher difficulties as combat gets deadlier.Several games have since then used similar themes and elements to great effect, so what makes this old timer so great? In my opinion it is the dread that the game instills in you, I haven't quite found a game that did it in a similar or quite as effective fashion. The player starts the game on the Von Braun some time after it has gone to hell and the Many has control. You end up feeling utterly alone on the Von Braun, light-years away from any semblance of help, while being sought out by the grotesque minions of The Many. You run around chasing your only lifeline and voice of reason in this whole mess, while wading through the sludge that used to be the crew of this ship only to sink deeper with every step. I remember feeling utterly crushed several times with the relevation that my struggles had only brought me more terrors to face.It is a superb game, but it is not without flaws. The latter part of the game gets less and less refined, most visible in the level design. As the game progresses the areas seem to get less and less polished, which is a shame as the details helpes alot with the atmosphere that makes this game great.  The Von Braun is largely well made for its time, but the Rickenbacker is bland, uninspiring and seems like it was rushed. The last stages of the game has some quite exotic themes and the technology of the time was perhaps not well suited for something as ambitious as these areas.Despite that, I recommend this game to everyone looking for a classic Survial Horror game.

												Definately a hall-of-famer, it's one of those games that is remembered fondly years later, and was worth putting on Steam :)If you've played the early Deus Ex or Thief games and liked them, I suspect you'll like this too. Good storyline and atmosphere, the graphics are a bit dated though, and the polygon count is appropriately low, but you can forgive this in a game released in 1999.No game is for everyone, and this is from a generation of games setting new standards, so while it may seem like it's lacking in features, or has a tired storyline, it is in fact a game that has been often copied in those respects.I've played this game through several times over the years, and I rarely bring myself to complete games more than once. I'd definately recommend this game for what it is, and if it's on sale, even better - who wouldn't want to buy a classic for less than the price of a pint! :)			"

												System Shock 2 takes place a few decades after its predecessor. The stories aren't directly related so don't worry about jumping straight into this one. The first took place on Citadel Station, where an AI named SHODAN, stripped of her ethical restrictions, went batshit crazy with dreams of Godhood. She failed. Fast-forward 40-some years and you play a soldier on the maiden voyage of a FTL spaceship, built by the same company who was responsible for Citadel Station - TriOptimum. You wake up after cryo-sleep and, conveniently, suffer from amnesia - the favorite theme of infinite game developers world-wide. Needless to say, something bad is happening on board, but I'll leave the rest for you to find out in game. It reminded me a bit of Dead Space (or, rather, the other way around - if I had played the games by their chronological release), but it isn't a jump-scare ""horror"" game as I was led to believe. Creepy, yes. Disturbing, indeed. But it's not frightening in that traditional sense of changing your underwear. There aren't shocking twists and turns in the plot - no wheel is reinvented in this sci-fi space crisis. If you're approaching this at 2014 after being around the gaming and movie block for a while, you'll probably be familiar with most of the developments. You probably know SHODAN as the iconic villain from the game that is well-loved (out of character). I'm sorry for the upcoming blasphemy, but I didn't find her too different from the generic granduer-obsessed villain. Maybe it's because I'm playing this game 15-years late and I've been exposed to all sorts of antagonists. Maybe I'm just a dim-witted gamer who can't see the sophistication. She did have some shining moments, however, that made me realize that this is one messed-up cyber girl. And while my remarks here might make it seem as if I consider the game bland, that isn't the case. I enjoyed the ride, just more due to the gameplay rather than the story (which is the other way around with BioShock: Infinite).I played System Shock 2 after the BioShock trilogy and was immediately surprised. The amount of gameplay functions was a bit overwhelming at first, especially when you're used to modern gaming standards. I won't list these said functions down because I don't think it'll make any sense to a reader who hasn't played the game. You need to experience it to understand. After the tutorial and an hour or so into the campaign, however, I got the hang of it. More or less. Once I grasped the basics, the further I got into the game the more I felt a growing regret about how criminally streamlined the last installment in the BioShock series - Infinite - is, compared to its ancient ancestor. Now, I ike BioShock: Infinite, I really do. But it pains me to think how magnificent it could have been if it maintained some of SS2's complexity in RPG mechanics.If you've played the BioShock trilogy you'll quickly notice the shared DNA. Shock 2 has the audio recordings you probably like (I certainly do) that help tell the story. It has its ""magic"" abilities (like Plasmids and Vigors), it has hacking of security cameras and turrets, it has vending machines, it has research of enemies, it has big maze-like levels that make you open your map time and time again - and as I wrote earlier, it has a lot more than that; things I enjoyed a helluva lot that I wish were in later games, too. The RPG is strong in this one. From ability scores to expertise in different sorts of weapons, this game offers you much more than your average shooting (which is good, considering shooting in 99's standard isn't as exciting and challenging as it is today).Actually, I should confess about the challenge - I started out on Nightmare (the last out of four difficulty levels), and early on lowered it to Easy. I know, I know. ""A filthy casual."" Maybe it's becuase I didn't have a lot of time per day to play and didn't want to waste what little of it I had respawning and refighting the same fights. Maybe I didn't enjoy the combat mechancis of a 15-year-old game. Maybe it was just honestly too tough for me. Maybe a bit of all, or something else entirely. I can speculate that on Nightmare this game truly /is/ a challenge. Your HP is extremely lessened, I suspect enemies do more damage, and every upgrade requires many more ""Cybernetic Modules"" (think of them as XP points you find throughout the game). Maybe one day I'll replay it as a different class (I went for a Tech\Hacker sort) on the highest difficulty, because SS2 certainly has replay value between a Tech focused character or a ""Magic"" (Psi) one. But it is not this day.Speaking of 90s game - the graphics are, obviously, dated. However, I played it with mods which made the game look surprisingly pleasant and I strongly suggest Googling quickly for some prime graphical enhancements. System Shock 2 is a brilliant game whose age isn't half as felt as you might expect it to be, and shockingly offers more complexity than many modern products. A creepy sci-fi setting with an iconic villain, complex RPG mechanics while still capable of being played as a shooter, and a challenge to be found if you have the patience for it. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the BioShock trilogy in particular, and FPS-RPG games that amount to more than taking cover and shooting in general.			"

												If you enjoy eerie games of the 90s, System Shock 2 is the perfect game for you. You are an unnamed soldier given cybernetic upgrades after being recruited as a crew member of U.S.S Iforgotthenameoftheship (sorry). Your recruitment is essential, as it gives tutorials of the different play-styles (guns, technology, and psionics) and, more importantly, your customization options. You're given 3 classes, or rather careers: Marines, Navy, and OSA members. Marines are your standard class if you want to have a run 'n gun experience. Navy Seals specialize in hacking and strength, and OSA members specialize in Psionic abilities. Customization options continue depending on ""missions"" you take during a ""tour"" preparing for your career while aboard the ship. I quote these terms because they are not actual missions filled with action, merely filler explanations as to why you start with certain skills. After performing a your ""tours"" for three years you are upgraded in your cybernetic form and placed in a cryo pod, only to wake up to ship-wreck crawling with parasite-human hybrids and monkeys. This is where the gameplay begins. It resembles a survival horror game at first, with your only weapon being a bloody wrench. Soon you will discover nanites, or currency, data logs, and cybernetic modules. Data Logs actually contain quintessential information for learning more about the game's story. I actually enjoy listening to them, as they add a new layer of depth to the game. Listening to the logs of now deceased crew members is awfully eerie, meaning that this game is fulfilling its purpose in trying to make the player immersed in an uncomfortable fashion. Cybernetic Modules are the experience points of the game, allowing you to upgrade skills or psionic abilities. These, however, come far and few between, and you have to be prepared to make certain decisions regarding upgrading your skills at upgrade stations because said upgrades are permanent. Do not, I repeat, do not spread your skill points thin. You won't have enough to make it beyond mediocre. The general atmosphere of the game is very creepy and unsettling. What makes it even more unsettling is the fact that game is set in space, the setting one would least suspect as a subject for horror. Thoughts of a starship exploring the vastness of space usually leaves one with a sense of pride and overall positive thoughts. But this is no U.S.S Enterprise voyage accompanied by Captain Jean Luc Picard himself, or anyone for that matter. You're essentially alone, left to fend off against twisted creatures that were once human, and, more importantly, the highly intimidating, highly intelligent, highly creepy computer AI known as SHODAN. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is she creepy. Once in a while, when you least expect it, she'll begin a short monologue describing how much inferior you are. Her voice is mangled, fluctuating between an almost human, female tone and a demonic, twisted, deep voice. I almost jumped when she first spoke. I can safely say that the gunplay is alright, but it is clunky. If you're skill set does not have strong Maintenance, you will discover that guns break quickly, which really gets annoying at times. Furthermore, ammo either runs out quickly, or they cost too many nanites at dispensers (the equivalent to shops). This could either be a good or bad thing. The advantage of limited, expensive ammo is that it adds to the survival-horror element of the game, as it forces the player to conserve ammo and strategize how to plan their next move. The disadvantage is that it can be near impossible to progress without it, especially later in the game when there are more long-ranged threats. Luckily your psionic abilities counter this problem, if you're skilled. Psionic abilities essentially feed off of an energy meter, granting you super powers of sorts. They can come handy, such as the defense and cryokinesis (basic attack) abilities. It definitely adds to the otherwise sketchy combat. My biggest problem with the game, however, is your inventory interface. The game does not pause while it's up, which leads to many problems. For instance, the only way to switch weapons is to manually do so through the inventory interface. Now imagine that you run out of ammo for a particular weapon while a few hybrids are chasing you down. You don't have enough time to manually switch weapons before being clubbed to death by the hybrids. But you have to switch weapons if you don't want to lose progress being forced to run back. Furthermore, enemies respawn, meaning that if you visit an old area you might run into even more hybrids and monkeys. There is absolutely nothing you can do except die. I tried switching weapons in a similar scenario and managed to survive, only with 11 hit points and no health packs or healing station in sight. It was even against one basic hybrid while I had armor on. To top it all off, when I made it back, there was another hybrid, waiting for me. The enemy-respawn and user hostile inventory interface add questionable difficulty.If you're a newcomer to this game, like I am, I warn you that this is a very difficult game, even on the normal difficulty. However, System Shock remains as one of the more positively sophisticated and creepy games I have ever played, a game that still deserves to be critically acclaimed by many. Just turn off the music while playing; it ruins the creepy atmosphere.			"

												I'm only a few hours into it, but I'm thoroughly impressed by this late 90s classic. There's a surprising amount of realism available. Firearms degrade with use (A bit quickly, granted, but it's still interesting to see a mechanic like that in such a relatively old game), and those stim pack things slowly improve your health as apposed to automatically switch you from severely wounded to mildly wounded, or mildly wounded to suddenly completely healthy. There's some mild parkour abilities, like holding space to grab onto a ledge at about chest height after a jump, and pull yourself up the rest of the way. There's the ability to level up VARIOUS different abilities/stats. Lots of food/drink/booze/cigarettes available, and there's also no regenerative ability (so far), which is cool. After all, how does one heal in seconds or minutes from blunt force trauma, funky psi attacks, or gunshot wounds? You have limited inventory space, which is larger or smaller depending on your strength.Oh, this game also doesn't hold your hand. Even on Normal difficulty, it's not an easy game. There's no arrows pointing you in the direction to go, and so far there isn't even a minimap. You have to wander around, start to become familiar with your surroundings, and try to manage your way to where you figure you have to go. Ammo is also QUITE scarce, so try to conserve what you can. Luckily there's surgical table things that are automated, and they're scattered around the area. Not very common, however they only cost you 5 nano-whatsits, which is essentially money, so it's worth it to use one if you find yourself under half health.The atmosphere is very well done, the graphics are dated of course, but not exactly an eyesore. The story thus far is quite engaging, I find myself enjoying the game immensely in spite of the difficulty and lack of in-game assistance, and I look forward to finding out more. Searching new areas is always enjoyable because you never know what stuff you might find, and you can also backtrack to previous areas if you like. I have kind of an OCD where I have to do things in sequence; I've owned this game for months, but didn't play it because I wanted to find the first one. Finally I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. I was missing out. I don't know what else to say about the game other than that I am really enjoying it. If you enjoy survival horror games, then I advise you to check this out. Even if you're not into using firearms, there's different ways of defending yourself. Different modes of attack, as it were. There's even select fire capabilities, kinda lol Anyways, I look forward to playing it more and seeing how the story turns out. If you don't minds somewhat dated late-90s graphics, enjoy FPS games, survival horror, and the ability to upgrade your character to your own play style, then I truly believe you'll come to enjoy this experience as much, or possibly even more, than I am.

The GOOD:    Survival horror/ RPG blend that works perfectly in the first person. Replayability. HARD. Thick atmosphere. True feelings of isolation. Memorable antagonist. Tension, lots of survival horror tension. Different difficulties that don't just make enemies bullet sponges. The SOUND! The Voice acting. The GAME! All of theses combined make a powerful user experience.The BOTTOM LINE:   Labled as one of the greats, it deserves all of the praise. Ahead of its time. Things found in this game are present in the DNA of many other games released after it. A classic and timeless. A worthy experience to be played and played again later.			"

												System Shock 2 takes place a few decades after its predecessor. The stories aren't directly related so don't worry about jumping straight into this one. The first took place on Citadel Station, where an AI named SHODAN, stripped of her ethical restrictions, went batshit crazy with dreams of Godhood. She failed. Fast-forward 40-some years and you play a soldier on the maiden voyage of a FTL spaceship, built by the same company who was responsible for Citadel Station - TriOptimum. You wake up after cryo-sleep and, conveniently, suffer from amnesia - the favorite theme of infinite game developers world-wide. Needless to say, something bad is happening on board, but I'll leave the rest for you to find out in game. It reminded me a bit of Dead Space (or, rather, the other way around - if I had played the games by their chronological release), but it isn't a jump-scare ""horror"" game as I was led to believe. Creepy, yes. Disturbing, indeed. But it's not frightening in that traditional sense of changing your underwear. There aren't shocking twists and turns in the plot - no wheel is reinvented in this sci-fi space crisis. If you're approaching this at 2014 after being around the gaming and movie block for a while, you'll probably be familiar with most of the developments. You probably know SHODAN as the iconic villain from the game that is well-loved (out of character). I'm sorry for the upcoming blasphemy, but I didn't find her too different from the generic granduer-obsessed villain. Maybe it's because I'm playing this game 15-years late and I've been exposed to all sorts of antagonists. Maybe I'm just a dim-witted gamer who can't see the sophistication. She did have some shining moments, however, that made me realize that this is one messed-up cyber girl. And while my remarks here might make it seem as if I consider the game bland, that isn't the case. I enjoyed the ride, just more due to the gameplay rather than the story (which is the other way around with BioShock: Infinite).I played System Shock 2 after the BioShock trilogy and was immediately surprised. The amount of gameplay functions was a bit overwhelming at first, especially when you're used to modern gaming standards. I won't list these said functions down because I don't think it'll make any sense to a reader who hasn't played the game. You need to experience it to understand. After the tutorial and an hour or so into the campaign, however, I got the hang of it. More or less. Once I grasped the basics, the further I got into the game the more I felt a growing regret about how criminally streamlined the last installment in the BioShock series - Infinite - is, compared to its ancient ancestor. Now, I ike BioShock: Infinite, I really do. But it pains me to think how magnificent it could have been if it maintained some of SS2's complexity in RPG mechanics.If you've played the BioShock trilogy you'll quickly notice the shared DNA. Shock 2 has the audio recordings you probably like (I certainly do) that help tell the story. It has its ""magic"" abilities (like Plasmids and Vigors), it has hacking of security cameras and turrets, it has vending machines, it has research of enemies, it has big maze-like levels that make you open your map time and time again - and as I wrote earlier, it has a lot more than that; things I enjoyed a helluva lot that I wish were in later games, too. The RPG is strong in this one. From ability scores to expertise in different sorts of weapons, this game offers you much more than your average shooting (which is good, considering shooting in 99's standard isn't as exciting and challenging as it is today).Actually, I should confess about the challenge - I started out on Nightmare (the last out of four difficulty levels), and early on lowered it to Easy. I know, I know. ""A filthy casual."" Maybe it's becuase I didn't have a lot of time per day to play and didn't want to waste what little of it I had respawning and refighting the same fights. Maybe I didn't enjoy the combat mechancis of a 15-year-old game. Maybe it was just honestly too tough for me. Maybe a bit of all, or something else entirely. I can speculate that on Nightmare this game truly /is/ a challenge. Your HP is extremely lessened, I suspect enemies do more damage, and every upgrade requires many more ""Cybernetic Modules"" (think of them as XP points you find throughout the game). Maybe one day I'll replay it as a different class (I went for a Tech\Hacker sort) on the highest difficulty, because SS2 certainly has replay value between a Tech focused character or a ""Magic"" (Psi) one. But it is not this day.Speaking of 90s game - the graphics are, obviously, dated. However, I played it with mods which made the game look surprisingly pleasant and I strongly suggest Googling quickly for some prime graphical enhancements. System Shock 2 is a brilliant game whose age isn't half as felt as you might expect it to be, and shockingly offers more complexity than many modern products. A creepy sci-fi setting with an iconic villain, complex RPG mechanics while still capable of being played as a shooter, and a challenge to be found if you have the patience for it. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the BioShock trilogy in particular, and FPS-RPG games that amount to more than taking cover and shooting in general.			"

												I've just bought this on steam - no hours logged on steam itself but I've played this game on and off since it came out (1999)  Look at you, hacker: a pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine? This is, simply put, one of the best games ever created.  Have you played Deus Ex?  I hope you have because this is the only game that I'd put on the same level (and is fairly similar in some respects).  FPS-RPG cyberpunk horror pulled off with as much aplomb as you're likely to ever encounter.  This is a real gem from Looking Glass Studios, made before the time when all devs were interested in was jumping on a band wagon, creating something pretty and legging it with your cash.  This game is a psychological work of art.  In terms of surprises, in terms of being genuinely disturbing, in terms of thoughtfulness, in terms of storyline, in terms of music, in terms of voice acting, and in terms of really ""making you feel it,"" this game is the dog's bollo*ks.  The only thing that's aged is the quality of the graphics but it's a masterpiece even if you don't bother installing the excellent community graphics updates.Do you not trust the feelings of the flesh? Our biology yearns to join with yours. We welcome you to our mass. But you puzzle us. Why do you serve our mother? How can you choose cold metal over the splendor of the flesh? But you fear us. We hear your thoughts, and they rage for your brothers who you believe dead. But they are not. They sing in our symphony of life. We offer another chance to join us. If you choose to lie down with the machine, we will rend you apart, and put you separate from the joys of the mass.It's gonna drag you in and sh*t you right up, guaranteed.

												System Shock 2 is a wonderful atmospheric game. It's different than many FPS' in that there's more focus on the story, experience, and exploration. The story unfolds as you discover audible recordings and make progress through the game. There's also different stats, skills, and abilities which allow you to create your own unique character and focus on the skills you'd like to improve. Main skills focus around: weapon types, hacking, fixing, and cybernetics (magic). Typically you specialize rather than try to have all of them low level.There a bit of inventory management--you can only carry so much. You must make room for quest/progress items--other than key-cards.A few warnings. The game is buggy. However, there's some on-line tutorials about patching the game to a more stable version (PC Version). There's also some great mods--for the PC version--that improve the textures, models, etc. Also, be wary of multi-player--which is also buggy. I wanted to play this with a friend, however, the game would freeze, and it became a bit challenging to play the game. You also will only see each others characters after selecting you character path (abilities)--post fourth year.In all, if you've yet to ever play this game, you might enjoy it the most playing it single player first anyway. It's easier to get into the atmosphere/environment.			"

												Do you like Bioshock? well this is its Grand Daddy. System shock 1 was a great rpg but a terrible fps. System Shock brings back everything the first one did right and improved every single aspect. This game inspired many of the recent loved RPGFPS we see today, distopian future where something goes wrong.Played this in the 2000s and now after so many years i bought the steam version (this one actually is the more stable one, being GoG the second best).This game is ageless, even thought its graphics are not up to today standards, modding comunity makes it and revitalizes its visuals.Not an easy game to slip into comfortly, it needs studying, patience, reading and its sometimes slow paced. Combat is great, the animations still suffer a nip of stiffness nevertheless.This game has one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) plot twist in the whole gaming industry and any industry in general.If you respect yourself as one person who enjoys quality gaming you NEED this game. This game set up the bar REALLY high for this genre and few if any, have reached its amazing ideas and novelty. And most of all remember this is 15 years old right here. In some way it reminds me of Metropolis from the 20s, also ageless.NOT for the running spraying type, this needs patience and thinking.			"

												The spiritual prequel of Bioshock. If you play both games the resemblance becomes very obvious.This is a role-playing survival-horror game. While by the end of Bioshock your character becomes so strong with so many weapons that the game ceases to be challenging. SystemShock2 on the other hand, if you don't upgrade your stats very carefully and save up on ammo and consumable items you will have a very hard time. The game gets harder as it goes, not easier.Both games have a problem with balancing difficulty. SS2 gets too hard. Bioshock gets too easy.Combat is hard. Weapons degrade and jam (weapons dont jam for enemies though which I find to be cheap). Weapons require specific stats to even be able to use them. Ammo is scarce. Inventory space is limited. Enemies seem to respawn (which can be very frustrating because it wastes your already limited resources). It can feel redundant at times since cameras set off alarms that spawn enemies.You cant sell items until much later in the game if you get a certain item.Special actions (hacking, repair, etc) uses up currency (aka Nanites). There is even a minigame to repair items. Failing a minigame results in an explosion, breaking or alarm depending on the object.The game doesn't hold your hands. Consulting the map doesn't help much either. You will have to explore carefully. Audio logs and objectives arent that well organised in the menu either.The game has a real sense of accomplishment whenever you complete an area. This is a game best played in limited doses. Don't try to complete it in one playthrough. It will exhaust you and stress you out.I also found that personally disabling the ingame music alows you to better concentrate.The game has a very interesting villain... The game, in fact, has villains (plural). But one in particular stands out. A villain that is reminiscent of GlaDOS.

												Having never played any game in the System Shock series in my life or heard of it until rather recently, I came into it with an incredible level of skepticism. My fear was that everyone was looking through rose-tinted glasses and blinding themselves to design flaws or serious issues with the game, something I feel like a lot of old games suffer from unfortunately. While there are issues with this game, I'm going to start with the positives. The level design for each area is incredible, my playthrough was completely blind and I forgot entirely about the map, I never used it once, which is a good thing. Each area had distinct objects or looks, so I never really found myself wondering where I could possibly be or where anything was. Each time I entered a different room, I knew exactly where I was and where any room I had been to previously was in relation to it.On top of that, each level is very large and still seamlessly connected. Any loading screens I found myself staring at were only there for a mere moment before I was on the other side and ready to go. On to the atmosphere, it deserves the praise it gets from all of its fans. The game works incredibly hard to build up a feeling of isolation while at the same time enemies in the form of rogue robots or horrific monstrosities are crawling out of every crack in the wall. While playing I had never felt so alone and yet so outnumbered and overwhelmed at the same time while being so desperate to meet up with even one friendly face. Even the enemies manage to be worthy of fear, their appearances combined with the amount of damage they do and the voice lines that they had lended multiple reasons to fear them. Failing that they usually had the element of surprise on top of everything else, which is extremely difficult to predict unless you're slowly walking along, listening for them and even that doesn't work sometimes.The combat, oh the combat. I can't possibly say enough about it, there are so many ways to approach a fight in almost every situation. Especially if you manage to sneak up on them, run in guns blazing as some arms specialist. Cave in their skulls with blunt force trauma and brute strength as a melee specialist. Freeze, burn, drain, hypnotize or sneak around them, invisible, as a Psionic specialist. And that's if you even want to fight them, if you decide you want to save whatever ammo you can for a necessary fight so you devise some skiddish guerilla-warfare fighter that leans more on hacking and utility skills while using a light combination of combat abilities then go for it. Almost no fight in the game is absolutely necessary as you can outrun and hide from almost any foe in the game. Not to mention what you choose to be best in actually changes your playstyle in a significant fashion.The hyper endurant marine might be able to stand there and keep shooting enemies while staying alive off of pure testosterone and gunpowder. But due to their physical focus they will definitely suffer when it comes to situations that call for hacking or researching, which can put them in some very bad spots. Whereas the Psionic specialist has all of the strength of a wet noodle and the endurance of tissue paper, but their intelligence will come in handy when hacking, or researching and at the same time present a completely different form of danger and combat prowess. Rather than just being the same old marine that just shoots guns and has a way to shoot guns in a slightly different way to shoot guns that could possibly be more effective. A problem that many mutiplayer games suffer from today.The story was great, in my opinion. While there were certain points where I found myself questioning things just a little, it was never enough to put me off of it. The length was perfect, long enough to keep me invested to the end so I could see how it turns out, yet not so long that it felt drawn out and wore out its welcome. It was one of the few times in gaming that when I was coming up to the finale I felt a genuine sense of climax and when it finished I was satisfied with it, despite the ending being a teasing cliff hanger. Right, now what was bad about it? For one, anyone who is new to the game will likely be met with the point where reality slaps them in the face hard and they discover that they've been specializing themselves wrong and now can't progress any further in the game. Forcing a restart. Which can be extremely frustrating to those who would like to simply play the game through rather than just get to the 70% mark over and over again. I had been warned about this so, despite knowing it had the potential to completely ruin the game for me, I entered a cheat that maximized my statistics permanently. Still wanting to have the best experience I possibly could, I cranked the difficulty to impossible for my run through. I will admit that having max stats from the starting gate did cheapen the game in some areas, but the difficulty made up for it.While playing through the game and encountering as much as I did, I couldn't shake the feeling that the game had been partially designed with co-op in mind. Intended to have people of various skillsets so they would have to work as a team to cover those in areas where their particular skillset isn't helpful and letting those same ones take the lead when the situation changes. This would be a good thing, especially since the Steam version came with multiplayer modded into the game, were it not for the fact that co-op almost ruins a key part of the game. Atmosphere. Having a partner or partners around, living breathing reinforcements, denies any sense of isolation and can seriously dampen the psychological games the game tries to play with you. That said, I highly recommend the co-op play, it brings a very unique approach to team-based cooperation and is still very fun. Just play the game by yourself first, don't deny yourself the gem that is the atmosphere.For all the good I gushed out about the combat there are flaws, not deal-breaking ones but flaws nonetheless. The AI at times can create issues that range from silly to annoying, either spotting you through a corner of a wall and shooting at you or setting off an alarm, which thank heavens is an extremely rare occurrence. At the same time, the AI can prove to be rather dumb. I think that it was amazing for it's time, but there are instances where you'll walk right up behind a cyborg assassin and rub up against him even and he will refuse to notice you unless you walk right around in front of him. This is slightly more common though not by much, but when it does happen it fortunately ellicits a smirk and a little giggle due to the small levity it usually creates.On a final note, I think the melee enemies suffer greatly in this game, even without any real points in my agility it's almost insultingly easy to dodge an enemy melee attempt due to their usually extended and overlong attack animations. Even from the lategame melee enemies, if you have any agility at all it turns them into a joke, a game of how many times can you run up and juke back to watch them hit the empty air. This can happen anywhere and everywhere with any enemy melee attack in the game, which is a little sad. If it were up to me I would have someone shorten the animations or rework them entirely so enemies that try to knock your lights out present a legitimate threat to more than just the people who got stuck in the corner with them. This is my biggest issue with the game at present, but that said, it's still a rather minor problem and more of a gripe than anything. I still highly recommend this game to everyone who is interested in receiving a unique and very fun take on FPS horror.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time, love it to death. I forgot to do a review for it and its been awhile since I played it. System shock 2 is moody, atmospheric, interesting, tense and horrifying. Its a hybrid FPSRPG game that rewards players for exploration and completing objectives opposed to killing enemys for more XP. There are various ways to play the game and all playstyles are valid as long as you specalize.  Its a far superior game to bioshock by far, for the RPG and horror fans out there you owe it to yourself to play this game!!			"

												One of the best first-person RPG's ever made. This is better than its forebearers in almost every way, that is except for visuals and if thats the only reason you play video games than maybe you need to get your head checked. The atmosphere and overall feel of this game is one of urgency and dread. Whenever I hear a hybrid muttering or growling to itself, I nervously start looking for its source, deciding which weapon or psi-power to dispatch the threat with. Later on you encounter more horrifying opponents. If you like horror, strong story elements, and a progression system that actually makes you feel like your choices matter, System Shock 2 is for you. There are mods available to update the graphics some but I feel they're unnecessary. The game will speak for itself, you just have to step through the door==of your cryo-pod.			"

												The thing about this game is that it doesn't rely on jump scares, hell even the graphics are pretty outdated, but you see that not what horror games should rely on. This game has TERRIFIC voice acting, and what i mean by that is TERRIFYING voice acting. The voice acting and sound design MAKE this game scary and it gives you the feeling of survival, rather than action *coughResidentEvil6cough*. I wish more games would be patient and take the time to set up the atmosphere rather than take shortcuts with cheap jump scares. The only jump scares you get are the ones you create YOURSELF, simply because you don't check behind enough times. Lastly, if Time splitters is to goldeneye, then Bioshock is to System shock 2, and those games are timeless.			"

												System Shock 2 is an extremely vast, high-fantasy RPG set in the fictional land of Azeroth. Players can band together to complete quests throughout the game world and in instanced dungeons or raids. There are two main factions, the Horde and the Alliance, which are in a state of constant war (and thus divide the server.). Player-versus-Player combat is available in preset battlegrounds, arena areas, and contested world zones.			"

												In my opinion this game deserves way more praise than Bioshock, just a lot of people don't know about this amazing game. Bioshock 1 is System Shock 2 with a different coat of paint, even how the story progresses and plot twists are almost the sameOverall the game has a lot of gameplay mechanics, RPG elements, and really optimize keyboard and mouse controls for the interface and couple different playstyles. Although navigating the inventory can take some time to get use too. The difficulty can be challenging even the easy difficulty. As a survival horror game, this game is very creepy (as long as the music is on mute) The main antagonist Shodan is one the best villians I have every seen that she just taunts you through the entire game and sounds creepy as well. If you love Bioshock you will love this even more and let people know about this masterpiece, also there are plenty of mods online that can make this game look great			"

What could possible go wrong?System Shock 2 is no spring chicken but it holds up surprisingly well.  The game builds it's atmosphere of dread incredibly well and keeps the player on their toes.If you can look past some rough graphics you'll find compelling characters, a cyberpunk mystery to unravel and robust character customization.The co-op feature is also a great addition that allows you to see much more of the game that you would playing solo when building complementary characters.

												Genre: Survival Horror, RPG, FPS-Background-This, hands down, goes in my Favorites bookmark in my Steam Library and is easily in my favorite games of all time. At first, I was very skeptical as to why there are alot of good reviews on this game because it is almost, if not, 15 years old. So, I watched/read more reviews about it, and it peaked my interest. I bought it on the humble bundle store for a mere $2 and I would now buy it at full price if I didn't already have it. I'm about 10 hrs into the game already and close to being finished.-Story- (SMALL SPOILER)The story seems generic at first; some unidentified threat aboard a human aircraft in space. The sight of the hybrids didn't help either; however when you start piecing together all the logs/emails you start to notice that it is something more than just alien-like creatures in space. In addition, since I did not play the first System Shock, I was very surprised when I was introduced to the main threat in the game. As I stated earlier, most of the story is threaded by the emails and logs that you collect; some of the story is also given to the player to interpret by the atmosphere and the environment (text written in blood on walls, bullets scattered around the floor next to a human holding a gun, walls torn out showing electrical wiring, etc). Like I said, I'm not finished with the game yet, so the story might completely change towards the end, but I still believe the story is one of the good elements of this game. The only con that I had with story, (SMALL SPOILER) was the absence of living NPCs. The game might have intended for you to feel isolated and alone, but I wanted to hear someone's opinion about the whole disaster without just listening to audio logs.-Gameplay- The gameplay to me is reminiscent of the old survival horror games such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Dino Crisis in terms of resource management. The layout of the RPG elements remind me much of Deus Ex Human Revolution and Dark Souls 1(you have to carefully attune your skillpoints, if you don't you will die lol). Like all the games mentioned above, the player can choose to go a stealth route or a gun-toting maniac, this allows the player more freedom to choose what type of playstyle he/she wants to do and this is good in a pretty much linear game (although you will need to backtrack at some areas). Also, the tutorial is pretty decent, but in your first hour, if you are like me, you will be confused as a rock as to what exact skills to upgrade and invest in. The only con I would give this game in terms of gameplay is how in the beginning, you are sluggish in terms of movement, which is bad imho because it makes the game feel slow and lengthy.-Sound Design-The background music and the soundtrack is pretty amazing. The background music is ominous and mechanical. All you head most of the time is the clang and moving gears of machinery and the sound of broken wires. The soundtrack is pretty fitting too; its sounds futuristic and somewhat scary. Although I love the soundtrack, I recommend to turn that down or turn it completely off because its hard to hear the sounds of the enemies footsteps and dialogue-Graphics-This game was made in 1999, so obviously it is pretty dated. However, if you add the visual enhancements via mods, the game becomes entirely different (There are also mods for music enhancement and other things). So the only gripe I had, was Steam should have released some form of HD version of this game with the mods already pre-installed. Although the mods aren't really a pain to get, an improved and visually ready version of this game would be convenient.-Overall-Pros: Story is brilliant, gameplay is top notch, sound design is pretty goodCons: No NPCs, slow game in the first couple of hours into the game, soundtrack overpowers the brilliant sound design of enemy movement and background machinery, graphics are pretty datedThis game should be a must play for BioShock, Deus Ex, and Resident Evil fans. Its too good of a Survival Horror game to pass on.  "

												What can I say about this game that hasn't been said before? Well, I think this game is a bit like Coors Light. A little scary at first, but then you get used to it and it is one of the greatest things you will ever experience. You will be SHOCKED at how well this 1999 game holds up in 2016.Full disclosure: I got this game free from my friend ZIGS, who is married to the woman that voiced SHODAN. Thanks, ZIGS.			"

												If you can get over how bloody hard it is in the very beginning to just stay alive for 5 minutes, the game is very rewarding. The story is excellent. The audio design is extremely good, particularly for a game if its age. The graphics are... bad. If you don't handle old games well, don't buy it. Other than that, it's a must-play.			"

												Incredible story, checked this one out because it was the studio that made Bioshock and I'd heard incredible things about it, and it did not disappoint.  Few things:PROS: -Amazing storyline. A dark, complex story that holds up, had me looking for as many audio logs as I could to get more of the backstory and to discover the fate of different crewmembers-Character development was excellent (not so much for your mute character) considering the only interaction with a lot of the characters on the Van Braun was through audio logs. Observing how some descended to madness while others struggled for survival was fascinating. The development of the antagonists was also spectacular, and I saw why SHODAN is considered an all time video game antagonist.-Weapon variety and enemy variety are both solid-Playthrough time was excellent, really a substantial game that though long, never drags in terms of interest. -Also, considering the game takes place entirely on a spaceship, there was some pretty solid variation in environments, which I appreciated. -Player customization is very diverse. Replayability potential is there. I went through barely even using the psionic power, focusing more on weaponry and repair. CONS:-This is more a quibble with the mechanics than the gameplay itself. This is a very dark game, visually (although thematically as well, which is great!). The gamma slider does exactly squat, at least for my laptop, and while for the most part it's not that big a problem, on one of the later levels in particular it makes the game very difficult to navigate. -Also something that might have been specific to my computer, but the game wasn't terribly responsive when it came to firing weapons, and something that drove me crazy was an inability to fire a gun while moving.  This meant that when faced with some of the stronger enemies, once they got within a certain range it was unpreventable death. Overall, great game even as we approach something like 20 years. I would love a remaster a la the Resident Evil remaster, since the graphics definitely could use an upgrade, but even the poor graphics don't detract from the experience that much because the story is so strong.10/10 story8/10 mechanicsDefinitely recommend!

												It's about time I got my hands on this great game! The atmosphere and pacing are exceptionally done, and though the game isn't technically an RPG, it definitely excels at being a Survival Horror/Action game. System Shock 2's controls are pretty standard fare for its time. That is, simple and straight-forward. Don't let that fool you though. This is a fairly deep and complex game as far as general mechanics are concerned. You use Cybernetic Modules as something equivalent to stat points to enhance and customize your preferred skills. There are also a number of weapons that can be both found or researched. Weapons come in two types (Not counting your Psi Amp): Ranged and Melee, which are broken down further into Standard, Energy, Heavy, and Exotic. So, as you can see there is a lot of variety in armaments. There is also armor which is divided between Environmental, Light, Heavy, and Powered.Due to the fact that you can customize everything ranging from your melee damage to your running speed, this is one of the few FPSes besides Breakdown that makes focusing on melee-only a viable option. The ways this game lets you approach a situation is limited only by your imagination. However what really makes this game a gem is its story and the overall atmosphere. Enemy and level designs are done exceptionally in a way that makes you feel truly alone and hopeless. Even with the patched in co-op feature the game's atmosphere still shoves itself to the forefront and keeps you and your friend in a constant state of tension. Whether it's because you accidentally triggered a security camera/alarm, or simply got too close to an Annelid egg, the sound effects in this game seem to pierce your senses to the core.Helping this further is the fact that by the time you start the game, all Hell has already broken loose on the Von Braun and your only clues towards piecing it together are the Audio Logs and the mysterious Dr. Polito. You soon learn that the crew has suffered a fate worse than death and your struggle only seems to get more desperate once you attempt to rendevous with Polito in one of the better plot twists in gaming. I won't spoil the penultimate end-game, but I will say that it takes the already repulsive physical nature of the Many and cranks it to 11.With all that high praise aside, the game does feel quite dated both mechanically and graphically. Sadly only the latter can be fixed via the use of fan-made High Resolution mods (Don't expect them to bump the game up to next-gen standards, but you can expect them to look at least as nice as an early Dreamcast game.).I would not suggest passing this game up considering how cheaply you can get it on Steam.

												System shock 2 is a game that was made well ahead of it's time in my opinion. It is one of the best shooters i have played so far, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. With a great sound system, a menacing antagonist who will occasionally appear to make you feel more uncomftorable than you thought possible (and then some), and some nice level design, there is alot about this game the developers did right. There is an average variety of enemies who can, at times, prove a real challenge and some controls that you will have to get used to. However, once you look past that, there's not much bad about this game. With the main setting in space on a ship that has been through everything you can imagine, there are several sectors that you will get to explore, very nice level design, and sound that goes along great with the enviornments of the game. Shock 2 also has a nice RPG element to it, with three classes to master, which are the Psychic, Soldier, and Hacker. These classes come in handy in situations from fighting enemies to outsmarting complex security systems. The game's story is nice too, with some twists that will leave you astounded, and an interesting back story that will keep you wanting more. With all of this in one game, i would say the only real flaw is the textures of the characters and levels. However, this is a minor flaw at that, and with everything else to make up for it (and considering the time it was made), this game is a must-have for survival-horror fans and shooter fans alike.

The fact that so many websites still name 'The Legend Of Zelda' as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" gaming series ever only tells you how far video games still are from becoming a serious art. Music critics have long recognized that the greatest musicians of all times are Beethoven, John Coltrane and The Velvet Underground, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Film critics rank the highly controversial Stanley Kubrick over talentless hacks like Christopher Nolan who is highly popular with folks around the world. Game critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Legend Of Zelda sold more than everything else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. Music critics grow up listening to a lot of music of the past, movie critics grow up watching a lot of motion pictures of the past. Gaming critics are often totally ignorant of the video games of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that The Legend Of Zelda did anything worthy of being saved.

In a sense, The Legend Of Zelda is emblematic of the status of game criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it Call Of Duty or Minecraft) and too little to the merits of real developers. If somebody creates the most divine gaming experience but no major publisher picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of game critics will ignore him. If a major publisher picks up a game which is as stereotyped as can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said game. This is the sad status of gaming criticism: The 'journalists' are basically publicists working for major publishers, distributors and multimedia stores. They simply highlight what product the industry wants to make money from.

Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great video game like System Shock 2, which never sold much, and commercial products like The Legend Of Zelda. At such a time, game critics will study their gaming history and understand which developers accomplished which feat, and which simply exploited it commercially. "

												It's like 2AM and I was playing it and I heard a crash and I completely spazzed, if you'd saw my character, it'd look like he was having a seizure. I hate horror games for that reason...Although this game is usually 1 dollar since I've seen it go on sale a lot (through Humblebundle, Indiegala, Bundlestars, etc) and it's worth to have even if you mess around for 30 minutes. You'd be surprised the graphics of this time weren't all that bad and the voice acting sounds like the people were concerned and there was a problem (great voice acting from the 30 minutes I played).

												Playing this game for the first time in 2015 -- I recommend it very strongly to fans of FPSs, RPGs, and space horror. There are so many great aspects to this game that I will break my rule and compile a list:It requires and rewards exploration of diverse levels and environments. Everywhere you turn there is something you either need or want... or fear. There is some degree of backtracking, but that's part of the fun: as you explore more of the game world you progressively understand how it all connects together. I got quite emotional when I had to go back to the areas in which I started! So much had happened since then. *weeps gently*Nicely balanced skill-based character progression. Decisions you make on how to upgrade your abilities have very real consequences. Not only that, but there are paths you can choose leading to very different gameplay styles, thus allowing for some very nice replayability. On my first play, I focused on melee weapons and hacking skills. It would be quite a different game the next time I play it, focusing on psionics.Careful loot management: you never know when something might come in handy. Luckily, you can stash it and come back to it later... although it might not be so easy to get back. To help you out, it's possible to put markers on the map with your own custom text: a very practical and logical little feature that I hope other games would mimic.An engaging story that reveals itself slowly throughout the game via superbly produced audio logs, as well as environmental clues. The story is spooky as hell. The characters are not well developed, but there's enough details that you can get attached to them, even though you never quite get to meet them in the game. Or do you...?The game has aged very well, but you might want to install NeutralX2's mod pack for more up-to-date visuals. (Nothing very fancy, but at least it looks better for contemporary screen resolutions.)And it's hard, very hard in some areas. I played on ""normal"" difficulty and still got quite a challenge. It never got unfair or frustrating, though, so if you're feeling up to it, move your mouse away from ""easy""!If I have any criticisms, they're about the physics system: it's awful. Running and jumping around swinging sword-like objects can get a bit clunky (and even buggy) at times.But that's really petty criticism. This is a very fun and satisfying game, as well as an important piece of gaming history.I'd like to thank the developer for the effort of releasing a Linux version. Unfortunately, their release did not work for me. (It's based on WINE, by the way.) However, I could play it just fine on Linux using CrossOver and Steam for Windows.			"

												An earlier game by the makers of Bioshock.Imagine Bioshock but with outer space instead of the ocean, cybernetic implants instead of ADAM, psychic powers instead of plasmids, a computer instead of Frank Fontaine, a biologial version of the Borg instead of Andrew Ryan, and nanites instead of dollar bills.  Also, Bridgette Tanenbaum is some French woman, the pace is slower (for more of a survival horror feel; think Dead Space), and character development choices are permenant.So essentially, Bioshock is this but not in space.

												As tends to happen when people don't experience a ""classic"" until long after they came about, they are sometimes skeptical. I am not very skeptical about games that much, usually. In fact, I will often assume a game is better than what people say, but you can't do much more if they say the game is the ""best"" ever, which many people say about System Shock 2. But after completing it, I have to say:Play this game! Get it! If you've ever wondered about it, don't wait any longer!This game has landed in the group of my favorite games of all time. It stands the test of time in just about every aspect. And for a game in the 1990's, that is a great feat. I have played all of the BioShock games before I have played this predecessor, and I have to say that System Shock 2 has pretty much all of the features of the BioShock games, and even more. That is not to say that it suddenly changed my opinion of the BioShock games. They are all put together very well in their own ways and I love them too (hence why I have them on Steam after beating them on console).System Shock 2 is a challenging game, but very rewarding. I will advise not to play on the hardest difficulties on your first try though, as the game will quickly throw you aside. Technically, you don't have to worry about dying if you want to keep reusing the regenerators that you find in each level, but they cost money (unlike in the later BioShock games), thus you can't keep dying forever. However, I find that doing so will ruin the atmosphere of the game, so do your best to play it well; but don't try to be a perfectionist either, or you will ruin the fun that way.I liked the RPG aspects of the game, being able to modify items and upgrade your character. In some sense, they were just there to make the game harder as you can't use some items for a while, or hacking is worse. But they are still relatively balanced for the most part, except for PSI Powers. Honestly, most of the PSI Powers are useless and even if you invest heavily in them, you won't get that far. I feel like on hardest difficulties, using them at all wouldn't do any good. Others may say you can get far with them, but I just stuck to standard weapons and melee for the most part.Exploring the ship(s) was interesting, as the environments were relatively different in certain decks. The creatures around were very creepy, though eventually wore off on me and I wasn't as freaked out as I was at the start of the game. The game requires you to backtrack a lot at different times, which was rather bothersome, but the story kept me focused, and the audio logs that you find are very well-done for a game made at this time. It is interesting to see how a small set of characters made it (or didn't) through the events with the Annelids.The sound in the game was relatively well-done, aiding in the atmosphere. I enjoyed the music itself, but it did take away from the vibe of the game, and also makes it hard to hear enemies at times. Thankfully, it wasn't played that much in most areas, so I left it on. As said above, the audio logs were really well-done. All of the voice acting was great and kept me engaged.Speaking of voice acting, the best part of the game was SHODAN. A very interesting character with a very interesting backstory. All throughout the game, I felt very afraid of her, wondering how things were going to turn out. I think that the voice alterations done for SHODAN's audio were perfect and that she made the game entirely. She made the story much better, as I feel like the general exploration and backtracking would have worn you down without such a captivating person (or thing!) at your side the whole time.The only thing in the game that didn't really hold up well is the graphics, which isn't that surprising. But most games are still playable if you don't worry too much about the physical appearance. If you are, however, a stickler for how a game looks (even when it's as old as this one), then you'll be happy to know that there are very good mods you can download to improve the looks if need be.Really, the only thing that disappointed me about the game was the ending. I won't go into any detail here, but many people agree with me. It ruined the tone of the game and was rather sloppily done. I wish there had been something better done with it, as essentially throwing your players' hours of hard work away is terrible.But I have to say, play this game. Everything is put together well, especially for when this game was made. I only grew more excited as I kept playing and never got bored. As I said, I think the largest factor of that was SHODAN and the story with her. Easily one of the best video game characters of all time.			"

												Incredible story, checked this one out because it was the studio that made Bioshock and I'd heard incredible things about it, and it did not disappoint.  Few things:PROS: -Amazing storyline. A dark, complex story that holds up, had me looking for as many audio logs as I could to get more of the backstory and to discover the fate of different crewmembers-Character development was excellent (not so much for your mute character) considering the only interaction with a lot of the characters on the Van Braun was through audio logs. Observing how some descended to madness while others struggled for survival was fascinating. The development of the antagonists was also spectacular, and I saw why SHODAN is considered an all time video game antagonist.-Weapon variety and enemy variety are both solid-Playthrough time was excellent, really a substantial game that though long, never drags in terms of interest. -Also, considering the game takes place entirely on a spaceship, there was some pretty solid variation in environments, which I appreciated. -Player customization is very diverse. Replayability potential is there. I went through barely even using the psionic power, focusing more on weaponry and repair. CONS:-This is more a quibble with the mechanics than the gameplay itself. This is a very dark game, visually (although thematically as well, which is great!). The gamma slider does exactly squat, at least for my laptop, and while for the most part it's not that big a problem, on one of the later levels in particular it makes the game very difficult to navigate. -Also something that might have been specific to my computer, but the game wasn't terribly responsive when it came to firing weapons, and something that drove me crazy was an inability to fire a gun while moving.  This meant that when faced with some of the stronger enemies, once they got within a certain range it was unpreventable death. Overall, great game even as we approach something like 20 years. I would love a remaster a la the Resident Evil remaster, since the graphics definitely could use an upgrade, but even the poor graphics don't detract from the experience that much because the story is so strong.10/10 story8/10 mechanicsDefinitely recommend!

												System Shock 2 is the kind of game I show people when they say that all old games are inferior to modern games because I know of no other game from 2010 onwards with this level of depth and densely packed lore. Every audio log, item flavour text and message scrawled on the wall in blood serves to better immerse yourself in it's world and create. Not to mention the music which helps create a tense atmosphere, something which many games struggle with even today. To be honest, System Shock isn't perfect mainly because of the upgrading system, for you see, System Shock is a FPS RPG and NOT a FPS with rpg elements so being that if you try to hold a gun without investing a point into the basic stat; the game doesn't let you. This creates a dilemma becuase, later in the game, if you don't invest your points wisely you'll hit a brick wall you can't pass which really holds back the game. But, hopefully, modders will have something to fix that by now. So in summary, I give System Shock 2 a hearty reccomendation as long as you are willing look at a guide to invest your points well.

												This game is incredibly intimidating and brilliant. Graphically utdated by todays standards, however, it didn't matter. The level design, atmosphere, FPS mixed with RPG elements and overall pacing are phenomenal. Took me a couple of attempts to get into it due to how intimidating the game was at first but, once I realised the brilliance of it, I was hooked.This is now one of my all time favourite games and has made me a fan of the survival horror genre. It was a game I recommend if you want an experience. Im not saying that it won't be an expereince that makes you feel like an inferior worm though. The game will even tell you  you're one! "

												One of the best RPG's ever. Still awesome. The word *Classic* was meant for such finery and art as this. A gaming masterpiece. Immersive and engaging story told in an an excellently ecclectic way, pieced together as the player uncovers more information, understanding the relationships of the (superbly realised) characters, their stories and what they have been doing whilst you have been restlessy in hypersleep. It sets the whole scene so perfectly: and gives it an inherantly creepy edge all the way through, with the *ghosts* of the crew everywhere. It also still has some of the most genuinley scary and disquieting parts in any game ever, even still, despite the dated graphics; a real testament to it's creative game design. The diversity of play available to the player is not only in terms of the 3 main branches of service; but also how to mix and match aspects that come from each, with every new decision meaningful as you get more upgrade modules to enhance your particular chosen skills, that will determine how the game unfolds for you. In all areas there will be things you can not do yet, so you are always having to plan ahead strategically as well as thinking of what your immidiate concerns are. It fits perfectly with the open-ended sandbox type of play. You are set objectives, but so often its totally up you how and when you do them, which becomes more diverse the more you open up new areas; and I have always loved the fact that (nearly always) you can re-visit the early areas of the ship. This is a game that is packed with lovely ideas: the nav beacon system where you can write notes on the map, the inventive way that your character is *stored and retrieved* by the resurrection stations on each level, the degredation (enhanced entropy) of weapons, the scope of different ways to deal with incresingly complex situations that will have you continually juggling with the different game aspects, and the way that the *rules of the game* change as the story descends into a kind of obsessive bio-technological madness.I have played this through numerous times (still have the original disk and box and played it many MANY times ever before it was on steam), and is still fun+enaging+ scary AF!This is an absolute MUST for any gamer. 10/10. The interface system can be a bit clunky sometimes, but in reality; as flawless as any game could ever be.			"

												A word of warning: this review may or may not be spoilerific in nature. Given the importance of the twists and turns for the full ""System Shock 2 Experience""(TM), those who haven't played the game to completion should probably stop reading (that is if you've somehow avoided spoilers for an 18 year old game). If you're just looking for a recommendation, well... it's System Shock 2. It's a classic. Play it for your sake, if for no other reason.With that disclaimer out of the way, on to my actual thoughts on the game. If you somehow couldn't tell from the disclaimer and convenient large blue thumb showing its appreciation, i quite liked System Shock 2. The story is intriguing, the environments uniquely disturbing, and if you can stand the cluttered interface you'll find an RPG with a surprising amount of equally viable strategies and builds. And holy cow, that atmosphere. I personally challenge anyone to play the game for more than an hour and not feel engrossed by the world and the characters (the very vast majority of which are either found as audio logs or, optionally, cadavers). In particular, the Many are a great departure from the usual ""beastly alien"" found in science fiction, adopting the role of a foil to SHODAN's icy discontent at your presence. Particularly, i think that the use of visual storytelling is brilliant in SS2. The layout feels like a logical way for a space frigate would, and the many obstacles in your way are a great way of familiarizing oneself with an area and then thinking about the next as a connected part of a monstrous, living organism. That's probably the best way to describe the environment: a creaking, delapidated, and rather irate monster hell-bent on introducing you to demise in as gruesome a method as possible. The sense of isolation is strengthened by the fact that you are the only living human on the Von Braun ; everyone else has left, is dying, or is in the process of doing so. It makes that feeling of creeping dread a lot more present. In terms of content, the game feels just about perfect. While there is a bit of backtracking, it never feels too forced, and tends to increase the tension on higher difficulties. My first playthrough clocked in around 16 hours (pay no mind to my hours) and i still feel interested enough to give it another go on a higher difficulty with a different specialization. So, it's a highly atmospheric, well-designed, and surprisingly replayable game. Go buy it. It's awesome. "

												System shock 2 is a game that was made well ahead of it's time in my opinion. It is one of the best shooters i have played so far, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. With a great sound system, a menacing antagonist who will occasionally appear to make you feel more uncomftorable than you thought possible (and then some), and some nice level design, there is alot about this game the developers did right. There is an average variety of enemies who can, at times, prove a real challenge and some controls that you will have to get used to. However, once you look past that, there's not much bad about this game. With the main setting in space on a ship that has been through everything you can imagine, there are several sectors that you will get to explore, very nice level design, and sound that goes along great with the enviornments of the game. Shock 2 also has a nice RPG element to it, with three classes to master, which are the Psychic, Soldier, and Hacker. These classes come in handy in situations from fighting enemies to outsmarting complex security systems. The game's story is nice too, with some twists that will leave you astounded, and an interesting back story that will keep you wanting more. With all of this in one game, i would say the only real flaw is the textures of the characters and levels. However, this is a minor flaw at that, and with everything else to make up for it (and considering the time it was made), this game is a must-have for survival-horror fans and shooter fans alike.

The fact that so many websites still name 'The Legend Of Zelda' as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" gaming series ever only tells you how far video games still are from becoming a serious art. Music critics have long recognized that the greatest musicians of all times are Beethoven, John Coltrane and The Velvet Underground, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Film critics rank the highly controversial Stanley Kubrick over talentless hacks like Christopher Nolan who is highly popular with folks around the world. Game critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Legend Of Zelda sold more than everything else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. Music critics grow up listening to a lot of music of the past, movie critics grow up watching a lot of motion pictures of the past. Gaming critics are often totally ignorant of the video games of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that The Legend Of Zelda did anything worthy of being saved.

In a sense, The Legend Of Zelda is emblematic of the status of game criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it Call Of Duty or Minecraft) and too little to the merits of real developers. If somebody creates the most divine gaming experience but no major publisher picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of game critics will ignore him. If a major publisher picks up a game which is as stereotyped as can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said game. This is the sad status of gaming criticism: The 'journalists' are basically publicists working for major publishers, distributors and multimedia stores. They simply highlight what product the industry wants to make money from.

Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great video game like System Shock 2, which never sold much, and commercial products like The Legend Of Zelda. At such a time, game critics will study their gaming history and understand which developers accomplished which feat, and which simply exploited it commercially. "

There is a reason games try to emulate the feeling that System Shock 2 invokes, because it is an amazing experience. So next time you're having sex with a lady, think of System Shock 2, I know I will.-Jesus Chris			"

												OMG I LOVE THIS GAME! This game does sooo much right, from the atmosphere, to the RPG aspects, this game is amazing. This game has a very unsettling atmosphere that makes you actually kind of scared. This game also has an amazing RPG system, probably the best I have ever seen in a campaign. There is sooo much replayability with the skill systems it is not even funny! The only downsides of this game are the graphics (I cut it some slack due to the game coming from 1999) and not being able to broadcast it on steam broadcasting (at least I can't). All in all this game is a 10/10 masterpiece in my world, and I wish there would be a System Shock 3 someday along with Half-Life 3 and Left-4-Dead 3.			"

												Do you like the original BioShock or Bioshock 2? Then this game will make you step up the game from that. System Shock 2 is a true Survival-Horror FPS/RPG of which will put you in a ship filled with freakish mutants and an AI that will give you nightmares. BioShock, being the spiritual successor of the System Shock franchise, has similarities of System Shock 2 like the audio logs, different ammunition etc. Make sure you ration your resources and that you keep your courage alive if you're gonna dive into this game, you may not ever come back. I recommend it!			"

												PROS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The only game I've ever played that actually made me feel isolated and alone.-The sense of helplessness in this game is un-matched by anything I've ever played, and at the time of writing this review I've only played it for a few hours.-The RPG elements are brilliant, there's sooo many different character builds you can have it's insane!-Combat is pretty simple, mostly just aim and shoot. But all the strategies and options you have for how to take on enemies makes up for it.-It's a game from 1999 and it's already scared me 4 times.-The story and setting are fantastic.-Good options menu. (You can fully rebind controls and save control pre-sets)NUETRAL-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The graphics don't look all that great from a technical standpoint, but because of the art direction it still holds up ok.CONS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Difficulty can be a frustrating at times if you make a big mistake, or have no ammo for a section that reguires a ranged attack. Also you are required to have a research skill of 1, and a hacking skill of 3 in order to finish the game.-The GUI is awkward to use and just doesn't look good, especially the map.-Music completely ruins the atmosphere. I HIGHLY recommend turning it off before playing.VERDICT----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The best sci-fi horror game of all time. Even at full price this game is totally worth it.5/5			"

												This fascinating glimpse into the high stakes never-say-die world of ""baseketball"" is sure to please anyone on your shopping list this upcoming holiday season, but at some point the critic in all of us questions the need to steal ideas from the greats of this medium. I speak of titles such as Half Life, Dead Space, Portal, Resident Evil, and Bioshock. Shame on you System Shock!

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 2 | 3 4 *5*] = ~92% (83%-100%)If you don't get System Shock 2 at some point in your PC gamer life, you're doing it wrong.You're dealing with virtual reality interfaces e.g. whenever you play a 1st person shooter. While those interfaces are normal by now, developers still too often get them horribly wrong, so contrary to what most people might believe, we're not quite there yet. But the pioneering times are over, we're well inside the age of these games now.This is thanks to groundbreaking works like System Shock 1/2, Deus Ex (1), Half Life, Doom, The Colony, etc. - these games conquered the new territory. While someone else would have been there instead (We're not talking ""OMG nobody would have thought of that!""), these developers were there and made possible that we can have these new human experiences that were impossible before. It were these people who climbed the abstraction ladder to the next level and opened this door to mankind by giving this experience to the public.That is what you have to keep in mind. It is for these reasons that these games feel the way they feel. That is the magic behind the experience, which I do hope you can tap into.Enjoy the new world, however normal it has become to you by now.			"

												Where to begin!?!?This, in my opinion, is the greatest sci-fi game ever made. Not the biggest, nor the best, nor the one with the best graphics (the enemy models were considered poor even back when it was released, but you can update them now via a community mod).The main character (nicknamed 'Goggles' by the community, due to his eyewear) can be upgraded in many ways. There are three main areas of expertise: Weapons, Tech (hacking etc.), and Psionic (magic, basically). On top of that, you can also upgrade your personal stats, like Strength etc.Sadly, this is one of those games where there is a 'right' and 'wrong' way to level up. I will add, though, that it's hard to make your character completely useless. But not upgrading certain skills can make it VERY tough at the end of the game, similar to the Vampire: The Masquerade videogame.So why do I think it's the greatest?All the parts come together to create something greater than themselves.Because, for me personally, they've nailed the atmosphere - and nothing else gets in the way. It's that simple.For instance, Deus Ex: Human Revolution does a lot of the same stuff, gameplay wise. But I HATE the 'hacking' in that game with a wrath, which is why I will never reply it, ever. the hacking 'gets in the way'. I also can't stand the story or any of the characters.There's only a very few cutscenes - and only the intro and end cutscenes remove control from the character. The rest of the story is told along the way, and the audio logs can fill in the blanks - or be ignored. Compare that to, say, the recent Fallout entries, which remove player agency far too often for me to be able to truly enjoy them. Oh, I LOVE them, don't get me wrong. But I don't need to deal with that at all here, because it never 'gets in the way'.I can rebind keys effectively (I did not pay for a gaming mouse so that the extra buttons can be ignored, thanks), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.the music isn't overly annoying (even if it should have been replaced with mood tracks and ambient sounds), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.I don't need to install another Steam-like shopfront in order to play a game I bought on Steam (I AM LOOKING DIRECTLY AT YOU, GHOST OF GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.I don't need to install an inventory mod, because the inventory makes sense to me and doesn't 'get in the way'.And while she's showing her age (well, the game is), SHODAN remains one of my favourite villains in any medium, ever. While her insults can be intrusive on a personal (to the character, not the player) level, they don't 'get in the way' of me enjoying the game.In fact, the only thing that really 'gets in the way' for me when I play this game is......yep, you guessed it: Real Life. I award this game 100 Cybermodules out of 10, because I hate maths.			"

												I take into consideration that this game is not recent. I did not play this game when it was new, but I did appreciate other games that were released around the same time.I have to compare this game to Deus Ex, and in that regards, it falls hopelessly short. As most games of that era the combat was fairly basic, and varied only in as much as the player forced it to be. You can choose different paths, though on anything but the hardest difficulty it doesn't really matter unless you want to present yourself the challenge of using ""psy"" instead of weapons.The story was fairly predictable, not bad, but it didn't stand out as a masterpiece like it was explained to be. The inclusion of recordings really helped this along a lot, without them there would just be a shuffle of going from place to place, re-killing the same dudes, collecting random ♥♥♥♥ and using it on other random ♥♥♥♥ until you got to shoot the boss. There were a couple of twists and turns, but it wasn't anything overwhelming or shocking, they did add a little bit of intrigue.Overall not a terrible game at all, revolutionary for its time, but if you don't have the nostalgia aspect you'll find yourself grinding through it for the sake of playing a piece of history. If you want something far better and in a similar Genre, go with Deus Ex. It didn't feel like you revisted the same locations pointlessly a thousand times, the decisions you made mattered, and there were actual benefits to taking different approaches to play through the game rather than forcing yourself to experience unnecessary challenge.Fun? MehValid To Video Game History/Development? SureAppealing to players not familiar with the series? Nah. Just play Deus Ex if you want Cyberpunk from that period, or Bioshock 1 if you want the same game only better now.			"

The gameplay isn't bad, and the game isn't strictly user-unfriendly, but do prepare yourself for some uncomfortable first 10 minutes. After you've settled in, however, it's a classic.			"

												OMG OMG OMG..... They are working on SS3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!System Shock & System Shock 2 are my two favourite games of all time and now there will be a SS3.....I am literally wet with ""excitement"".......yeah let's call it ""excitement"".It's an FPS that requires you to think about what you need to do and where you need to go, to plan your upgrades, but the way it pulls you into the story with the logs scattered across the Von Braun and of course Shodan.......best villain ever.....she was so much more evil in the first one, but she never disappoints. If you can get past the dated graphics you will hopefully discover an amazing game, but for me the graphics are top notch and I can only pray that one day after the new System Shock is released from Night Dive(backed on Kickstarter!) and Warren Spector(all hail!) delivers us SS3 that we might one day get a remastered edition of System Shock 2.

If graphics are a problem there is mods out there to boost them to a high resoltion and another for some of the models.Other games with similiar game play are: the Elder Scroll Series (Skyrim), Deus Ex series, Borderlands series, etc. Only SS2 is scarier and more intense as you wade waist deep into the body count of your former space ship crew..... good luck.

												Despite how this game is clearly dated, there's a reason it's considered a classic. The writing is excellent, absorbing you in the story of the Von Braun, creating context for the world around you, and commenting on the conflict between individuality and collectivity.  A problem that I'd have to mention, however, is that it's hard to appreciate the writing when the game throws nearly a dozen mechanics and objectives straight towards you at once. The first time you play this, you'll probably be feeling exremely anxious, having to pick what upgrades to spend and navigating the bulky interface, all the while watching your back for whatever monstrosity may stumble upon your hiding places. Having said that, the gameplay is incredibly absorbing as soon as you have a handle for everything. For me, the second time I played this was even better than the first.			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONI bet this game was delivered a bit later than Half Life 1.Similar graphical level and approach.Similar  ""surprises"" at the beginning of the game but, less depth in the history board, to begin with.It adds hacking stuff, among their own approach that, probably influenced further games. I am seeing the door keyboard hacking in Splinter Cell, among other games, by example.Well, if you missed this game (as myself) when it was released, you have now the oportunity to check of those key games that were influenced by other key games and that influenced moderner key games.Too early to have a complete judgement.

												It is deservedly a classic. The atmosphere is tense, and great sound design means you are constantly on edge for what could be around the next corner. In terms of pure gameplay and resource management I truly think this game might surpass Bioshock; although the classic technology vs. environment story isn't as interesting as it's anti-objectivist spiritual-successor. One of the best experiences I had playing a game and definetly worth playing. A lot of people dislike the technomusic in this game but I kinda love it; I don't get all the hate, I mean I guess it does detrackt from the horror a tad but it's one of the few video game soundtracks that I will go back and listen to without playing the game.

												Finally beat this game after its kicked my ♥♥♥ in several attempts, and I think I get what all the praise is about now.Despite the rather janky shooting the game design is actually rather timeless. It is simultaneously a great survival horror and action/rpg game. And even though the actual plot is rather hokey and pulpy sci-fi, it actually manage to still have quite a few spooks. Which is saying something because Its not very often that polygony zombie boys that go ""bleh"" are actually scary because of their ubiquity. These specfific enemies when seen up close are actually kind of funny looking too. It goes to show that making something actually genuinely terrifying in a video game is not just spooky monster design it needs to be backed up by mechanics that make you feel vulnerable, and SS2 does that flawlessly. And honestly, that janky shooting is really not that bad, because it is plugged into a rather deep roleplaying experience whereby everything you wish to do in the game requires some kind of specialization. You can't just pick up a shotgun off the floor at the begining of the game and blast all the spookmen away. You have to meet the prerequisite strength and weapon skill requirements to be able to even wield it, and then that shotgun will still not be useable because you will also need enough repair skill to get it working again, and even if you do all that you will maybe have like 2 shotgun shells and little in the ways to maintain it. It may be kind of tedious at first, but it does convey a sense of helplessness in a hostile environment when you have all these complex systems thrown at you and you are expected to fix an entire space station that is rapidly breaking down by the minute without handy waypoint markers. So, you'll also be asked to make a mental map to remember where all the resources you couldn't use and/or carry before because sometimes the game will literally block progress sometimes until you have researching level 2 plus some chemicals to understand some mcguffin needed to progress. The secret to what makes a viable character for progression is budgeting your upgrade points into a specialized build. Sure in the late game those precious upgrade points are handed out liberally, but at least it builds up to that, meaning you actually understand how awesome it is when you are running 100 miles per hour, circle straffing around enmies while shelling them with grenades, because you were such a weak helpless babby in the begining.Oh yeah, and the sound track and sound design is impeccable.Its a great game, still, even. I'd say its probably an essential game to expereince and I'm so glad someone was able to bring it back from being abandonware. "

If graphics are a problem there is mods out there to boost them to a high resoltion and another for some of the models.Other games with similiar game play are: the Elder Scroll Series (Skyrim), Deus Ex series, Borderlands series, etc. Only SS2 is scarier and more intense as you wade waist deep into the body count of your former space ship crew..... good luck.

												In thirty years of gaming, since 1984 I have NEVER been enthralled with a game such as the case with System Shock 2. Play this masterpiece for two-hours and I swear you'll be hooked. It is one of the finest games ever developed and in my time I've just about played them all. The game is creepy, frightening, and intelligently written - enough to make veteran gamers shutter - and that's saying a lot. It's no wonder System Shock 2 has earned a place within the Gaming Hall of Fame. Once in your lifetime you must experience this game. I have only one regret. I wish the developement team that made this masterpiece could be reassembled to give the game a proper make-over with today's moderen graphics.

												MOST OF MY TIME WAS SPENT ON A COPY BOUGHT FROM GOG, NOT STEAM. Considered by many to be the spiritual precurser to Bioshock, System Shock 2 is a FPS-RPG with stealth and horror elements.The gameplay still holds up to this date. While not overly complex, you'll find that the gameplay is more advanced than your average shooter. There are some puzzles here and there that will require you to use your brain or require you to obtain a certain object in order to proceed. The gunplay is fairly standard as well, you point and shoot. Guns have a efficiency rating, so the more you use your gun, the more it will deteriorate. This can be fixed by repairing it.The RPG elements come in the form of player stats and classes. There's four categories: Stat, Tech, Combat and O/S. The Stat skill comes in the form of your average stats: strength, endurance, psionics, agility and cyber affinity. Tech comes in hacking, repair, modify, maintain and research. Combat deals with standard guns, energy guns, heavy guns and exotic weapons. O/S helps with your body's operating system, and can enhance it with modifications such as being able to run faster, jump higher, increased stats or being able to do other things. The classes include Marine, Navy and O.S.A. Agent. Marines are for the people who love to use guns and overall combat. You first learn to use standard weapons, then later learn to use other weapons. The Navy class is for players who want to play with the Tech side of the game. They are better at hacking, repairing items, modifying weapons and things like that. O.S.A. Agents are the most interesting and fun classes to play, but can also be the most challenging. This class uses Psionic Abilities, which gives you this ball that you hold in your hand that can allow you to do many different things, such as shoot energy balls, telekenisis, heal your self automatically or give you stat advantages.The graphics in this game still hold up today. The game looks a lot better than any other game that came out around that time, so better than HL1 or Deus Ex. The textures are smooth and nice, and with a few Steam updates, it runs really well. The athmosphere is at first a somewhat familiar one if you're a fan of Deus Ex or Mass Effect. Set in a futuristic space station, it's been overrun by an AI O/S called Xerxes. Pretty much, him and SHODAN (another AI) control the whole ship and there's zombies on it and other monsters on it. They've also programmed the robots to be hostile towards you. The whole ship is very unsettling. The whole ship has a cramped feeling to it, and combined with it being dark a lot of the times does not help it at all. It really provides a very scary athomosphere when playing.The sounds in this game are phenominal. If you're a audiophile, you will not be dissapointed by this. The ambient noises are eerie, the voice acting is surprisingly well for it's time and the music is awesome. I'd recommend using a pair of headphones for this game. Hearing the Hybrid zombies in the other room or the hostile mechs marching across the hallway is always frightening. Now, for some cons about the game.First off, I feel the interface is dated. It's really small, and doesn't upscale good enough on large monitors. It takes a while to get used to and it's hard to use if you don't have great eyesight.This game can be pretty challenging even on easy modes, and while this isn't really a con, it does put a lot of new players off, especially people who don't play older games too often.Along with being challenging, the controls are a little wonky. They make sense after you get used to them, but that's the thing, you have to get used to them.The lack of a journal system can leave you flustered. You have to make sure you pay attention to the lady speaking to you telling you what to do. PDA's help a little bit though.Overall, this game is very great, with very few bugs and cons. Challenging, fun and exciting everytime I play it. I recommend this game for people who are just getting into retro gaming. This is a good introduction into what games were like 15+ years ago. Other than that, I also recommend this to players who like horror games, FPS with more depth than your SHOOT DA BAD GUYZ muscleman games and RPG fans.My personal score: 9/10 [MUST PLAY]			"

												System Shock 2 plays sorta like Bioshock, has a plot similar (but much more complex and interesting in my opinion) to Portal, and a terrifying atmosphere that will make anyone (even those who have experience with the horror genre) near ♥♥♥♥ their pants. Although I've only gotten about halfway through this masterpiece, I can already say it's been up there as one of my favourite gaming experiences. No competition, SHODAN is the scariest ♥♥♥♥ing villain I've seen to date, even if only by virtue of the meticulous sound design that went into her voice. While the game may seem (at first) overly complex and dated; give the game a try and you will soon find that the tense environment not only overshadows, but is aided by the gimmicky control scheme and '90s cyberpunk visuals. Play for horror, rpg, and/or cyberpunk elements, there is something for everyone in this game.Overall, I would give System Shock 2 a 9/10, and recommend it to anyone familiar with the fps genre. If you've got $11 dollars to spare, you should definitely give the game a try.			"

												System Shock 2. A game for people who enjoy playing games without having a tutorial shoved down their throat every 15 seconds. Firstly, the score that accompanies this game is just amazing (score composed by Eric Brosius), the art design is great and the lighting of all things is still on par with a lot of games today. It runs on the Thief engine and plays flawlessly on today's PC's. No hand holding in this game, just you against the horrific remains of the crew and the morbid voice of Shodan aboard the Von Braun. All of the voice acting in this game is really good, especially the voice of Shodan (Terri Brosius). System Shock is a Sci-Fi, heart attack inducing experience like no other.The game mechanics can be quite complicating at first (unless you've played SS1) as there are lots of things you must wrap your head around to fully get this game. You have stats for weapons, tech, psi abiltities and overall skills (things like strength and Agility). You have a large grid based inventory that forces you to prioritise certain items over others. you also have a very large range of choice when it comes to weaponry and how you use it. There are multiple ammo types for nearly every weapon and alternate fire modes (obviously not for melee weps).   There are a lot of things that are great in SS2 but there are still many things that hinder it. These hinderences include some horrible level design around 80% into the game's story (the many), shotty hit detection in areas and overlapping dialogue in certain areas of the game. It is also noted that some of the enemies in this game take way too many hits to go down like the rumbler and the psychic floaty squid thingies that dish out insane amounts of damage in return, this wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so frequent in the last portion in the game especially since ammo is very scarce with these guys just eating it for breakfast.I think SS2 is a game that really benefits from more than one play through as there are many different playstyles and weapons/abilities/skills you can experiment with that will significantly change your experience in sme aspect. Just to warn you, you can seriously ♥♥♥♥ yourself over with your skill points if you use them poorly to the point that it would be better to just start the game again. One thing that I think really holds the game back is that there is only one set ending. Having a set ending isn't such a bad thing but in a game with so much choice in playstyle, it seems sort of like the game is only crippling itself. Multiple endings in my opinion could have made SS2 a much better game with much more replayability and maybe put itself up as high as a game like Deus Ex (which in my opinion is the greatest game ever made on the face of the earth). I only nitpick because I have now played SS2 multiple times and have had time to analyse it's positives and negatives to further enhance my judgment of the game's quality without too much bias. It is definitely worth buying as it is an extrodinary game overall with great music, dialogue, voice acting and atmosphere. Please, please don't buy the next Call of Duty or Assasins Creed. Buy games that the developers actually gave a ♥♥♥♥ about. Buy this and play a real game.			"

												2016 review on a game that I've never played, however, have heard about for years and years as the #BESTTHINGOEVEROMGPLAYITNOWOMFGThat said, it's aged well with a great modding scene, however, the game 100% hurts from the design aspect. Played for a few hours, levels are interesting enough, on normal mode, the game is beyond tough and thus the positive review and recommendation. Deleted it after running into the first robot, dying time after time for several minutes and giving up on that area all together. Great game if you like a challenge!!!			"

												EDIT: After mulling on it for a while, and doing a bit more research, I think I've managed to pinpoint why I didn't enjoy this game.At the risk of sounding like a casual or a scrub, It's just too damn hard.Apparently, even easy difficulty is fairly difficult, and I had the guts to start on hard. As a general rule, whenever a game offers me three or more difficulty options, I go for second-highest option, because sometimes games will reserve the hardest option for people that have abandoned the concept of fun and seek only to prove that they are the very best.By the time I realized I was in way over my head, I was four hours in, and restarting at that point just didn't appeal to me. Why restart when all I had to do was lower the difficulty?Because character builds. Doing nearly anything in this game requires some amount of investment in the form of stat points, which the game hands out very slowly. And apparently, at some point, you absolutely must have some points in a couple key skills, or the game is unwinnable.I think the reason I complained about infinite respawns vs finite resources is because I had a bunch of resources I couldn't even use. By the time I quit, I had something like seventy pistol rounds, but because I couldn't use a pistol, they may as well have been paperweights.And to be fair, I believe there are infinite resources as well. Each of the infinite respawns can drop resources, it's just that you have to kill them without spending more than you get, which essentially means you have to clobber them with a wrench a few times without taking any hits. Given the clunky feel of the wrench (and, when it comes to monkeys, the questionable accuracy/hitbox), that just doesn't appeal to me.Original, unedited review below.After seeing numerous sources recommend this game to me, I decided I'd give it a try. I mean, I liked Bioshock, and this is practically its daddy.Whatever all you people see in it, it's obscured by one glaring systemic issue.There are infinitely respawning enemies in a game where managing limited resources is a primary challenge.Infinitely respawning enemies is a bad idea most of the time, but when every single one of them almost invariably chips away at your ammo count, stack of health stims, or psi points, it starts to feel like the game is punishing you for exploring. This runs in direct contradiction to the game's semi-open-ended nature.It results in a game where you quicksave after every victory, and then quickload if your next enemy encounter goes poorly. Sometimes you quickload the same quicksave several times. That isn't fun. That's tedium. That's bad design.			"

												Remember liking the game back in its day.After gettting into it again in this day and age, after the rose tint of nostalgia wore off I just could not bear it anymore.IMHO a classic from days gone by, which has not aged all that well.I wish I did not play again, would have preferred to remember it as the classic it is embedded in the warm fuzz of nostalgia.As such not recommended, or only to die hard fans of such games.

												On June 6, 1969 a man known only as Apostle died in his sleep at Childress Medical Hospital. The only thing he had on him were his clothes and clenched in his hand, a note. It read as followed.""Forgive me for the man I have become and not the man that you have raised me to be. Forgive me of the sins that eat away at my heart, and forgive the people who took this body and desecrated it to fulfill their own ideals. Tell my mother I love here, and tell my grandmother I'm coming to see her.""This man known as Apostle died with a smile on his face. May the father forgive and may he rest in peace.			"

												I highly reccomend getting this game.This is a game that is worthy of the title PC game, it has been optemized for PCs that run Windows 7 and CPUs with more than one core.While the graphics don't look like much mods can fix it since back then mods were a big thing like PC gaming at the time (not that PC isn't big now but there aren't as many devs smart enough to realize it).The guy you play as 1-hands every gun even weapons that are normally 2-handed like rifles and shotguns, now if that isn't badass i don't know what is.This version doesn't have the 4-player co-op that the patched CD version did but again mods can fix it, i think the same mods that improve the graphics.If you haven't played this game at one point and said it's not good you're not a PC gamer so, you know, BUY THIS GAME.

There are even a fun items! Like a mini game pads! You can PLAY A GAME INSIDE A GAME!You are too scared of mutants running in corridors around? Find some safe corner, play some car games or Tic-tac-toe... Relax and then continue!You can hack locks around in a game..You see people dying around and leaving logs....you will read them...you will try to survive.

												System Shock 2 may have been a good game when it first came out. I'll even admit I enjoyed the game when I first played it years ago. With that being said, this game hasn't aged very well. A combination of frustrating controls, stat based requirements for progression and poor game mechanics does this game no real favors. For the $10.00 price of admission, I just can't really recommend this game at the cost. There's better and more modern games you can find around the same price tag. If this game were cheaper (maybe $5.00) then maybe. If you can get this on a sale, I encourage you to do so, but not at the current asking cost.			"

												Opening note: you don't log Steam time when you put all the patches and mods on due to the executable being different. My play time is not 6 minutes, but rather more like 5-6 hours.This is the second major release that I've played from Looking Glass Studios and I don't get the appeal of these games. They were good 'ideas games,' as obviously games that have used their mechanics like Deus Ex and Splinter Cell were top notch. But I never played these growing up, so I don't have nostalgia glasses on like many people. I gave this game a third try recently with all of the new mods to make sure it ran well on modern hardware and looked prettier. I still didn't care for it.What starts out as an interesting 'choose your own adventure' premise, with you customizing your starting skills, quickly leads to a disaster of trying to accomplish anything. The story is...kind of non-existant in the first 2-3 hours - find a scientist who can help you figure out what's wrong with the ship you're on. While you are jumping through crytpic hoops to get to the next objective, you can find a bevy of really boring enemies with awful AI. God help you if you happen to be listening to a recording on your UMD, find a ghost, and then hit a story event all at once - ALL OF THEM START READING AT ONCE. And then you might find yourself getting sneaked up on by an enemy because you can't hear them over all of the narration going at once.Much like Thief, I appreciate what this game was shooting for, but it's not really very good or attention holding after the first few hours to me. People had often said if I was disappointed with Bioshock that this was the game to get due to how much better it was. I can now see why I didn't like Bioshock; because it was based on a cool idea that had minimal underlying substance to it.			"

												If you've played BioShock and don't at least want to try Shock 2, well, slap yourself.System Shock 2 is one of the most influential games of all times, yadda yadda, masterpiece, yadda  yadda. Long story short this is where BioShock came from. You can trace it back to System Shock, but System shock even in comparison to 2 is a primitive, vastly inferior game.Essentially SS2 plays out very similarly to BioShock games. You're a dude, thrust into a situation - although System Shock 2 being far heavier on the RPG elements actually gives you a training course and an entire section during which you create your character and choose their path - and things spiral out of control as you, the player, move the story forward and realize you're nothing but a pawn. Setting those nuances aside, SS2 is still very much an FPS first and an RPG second. You will be killing a lot of things, with a lot of different weapons, and a lot of them will probably break too, not to mention be beyond your ability to mod or repair for a significant portion of the game. Fortunately for you, if you're terrible at aiming, the hit boxes for enemies are very large, considering the game is from 1999.And yes, you'll probably get killed by a monkey, and turrets, and radiation.Many sources will tell you SS2 was a landmark for storytelling and player driven narrative (though HL1 is probably more so) but SS2 basically took the concept of finding plot bits in written form - like in Resident Evil - and converting them to audio. It gives life to the characters, and adds a new layer of immersion when you unravel a story as if you are actually listening to the audio logs or reports or whatever left by these people. Just like BioShock 1, 2, 3, and Dead Space 1, 2, and 3. Other than that, SS2 is definitely one of the first games that screwed with you - a lot.You can easily get this game for 1 dollar on Steam and pretty much anywhere else, when the sales are right, and after you do that, there are a wealth of well preserved mods on the internet to try and update the 16 year old graphics to something slightly more pleasant on the eyes. Unfortunately there is no complete remake, and likely never will be, but if you're going to take the leap, you may as well play the original anyway.			"

												I really don't know how to rate this game.I can see why it got so much praise back in the day because in many ways this game IS enjoyable even today and one thing I appreciated was how much it make you THINK.The menus/interface, while convoluted by today's standards(and extremely hard to read on higher resolutions) are still manageable and serve their purpose on a satisfactory level.The visuals look like pure ♥♥♥♥ cakes but with NeutralX2's Mod Pack this game gets a pretty nice face lift and in comparison to the not so well aged Deus Ex, it runs beautifully at 60FPS.The soundtrack is pure 90's techno bliss and deserves an award by itself.The atmosphere is killer and in comparison to it's successors(Bioshock) it gives you a much stronger sense of danger through that same atmosphere.The story is cool(though nothing new per se if you've already played the first Bioshock) and it's all very immersive.The problem with System Shock 2 like in it's weapon systems, overly complex RPG elements and its GOD AWFUL wrench combat.In Bioshock it's not always a big deal to be left with only your wrench to use. In System Shock 2 it's a much different story. The attack animation is ridiculously dated and there isn't even a mod to improve it.This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the aforementioned problems with the weapons and RPG elements were better.Ammo is way too scarce and powerful weapons like the shotgun and grenade launcher for example require you to level up certain skills before you can even use them even after you've found them. So, for a nice few hours of backtracking and getting enough cyber modules just to use ONE WEAPON(that still may only last you for so long due to scarce ammo), you'll be using the wrench.It's a grind fest on the level of unbearable sometimes and God forbid you set of an alarm. You'll be battling hoards and hoards of zombies like enemies until the alarm passes and it's always THE SAME DAMN ZOMBIE. At best he may have a shotgun some times to ""mix it up"" and there's also the occasional gun turret and kamikaze robot. -_-You will be using the wrench A LOT unless you already know ahead of time to enlist with the OSA and build your psi powers more than everything else. Do NOT pick the Marines if you decide to play it anyway because as I said before you will be screwed and doomed to wasting more hours to make progress than what should be necessary.This game was made more for PSI players than anything which sucks because I'm the type that uses PSI powers as SUPPORT for things like firearm combat. Not the other way around.I would have likely enjoyed this game more with a few minor things improved and again I can see why people loved it so much in 1999 but let's be real here...It's not 1999 anymore.I'm overjoyed to know the IP has been picked up and we can expect some new System Shock games for THIS generation but System Shock 2 in this state is not one I can recommend to anyone unless they just like wasting their own time.Wait for System Shock 3 and the remake for this one and the first and if you have yet to play Bioshock play those instead.

												I got interested in SS2 because I am a big fan of the original Deus Ex and have played through that several times.  This is no Deus Ex.  DX has stealth, conversations, and an engaging story.  SS2 seems to be an old-fashioned shooter that may have story elements to it, but I don't have enough peace from being attacked to listen to any of the logs and understand it.  About the only similarities I see to DX are the graphics and the fact that they both start out relatively hard -- but SS2 is MUCH more difficult to start than DX.  I started at ""normal"" but immediately had to reduce to the ""easy"" mode and I still die over and over.  The narrator says things, but I have no idea what she's talking about.  ""Go to Storage Room Blah-Blah and get a Something-or-Other.""  The storage room isn't marked well on the map, which requires you to tab out to see and then needs a magnifying glass to read it.  If you can see what you want, it's at the far side of a maze and you can't find your way there without constantly re-opening the entire map -- which is usually when you get attacked, so you might as well just roam around and hope you come to the right spot.You can easily understand the advances in gaming since this game was high tech.  There is no tutorial; the map is poorly designed; every alarm you set off brings fresh hordes of attackers; when your inventory is full and you pick up something, the game drops something else for you, which you may not notice; and items on the floor may disappear without notice.  Another thing I've noticed is that the guides for this game are written by experts who assume more knowledge than I have.One thing I'm not complaining about are the graphics or the sound; there are enough mods out there that these are not a problem for me.  Just the gameplay.  I've had numerous restarts and spent a couple of hours roaming around and trying to figure things out, and it's just not fun, so I'm giving up on it.  Thankfully it was cheap so no great loss there.			"

												Time has not been nice to System Shock 2. I played for a few hours with a friend. A mistake I guess, but I probably wouldn't have had the patience playing solo even for that long. I played using NeutralX2's Mod Pack (better visuals).Audio was pretty basic, albeit monkey screams echoing and hybrids telling you how sorry they are had more of a comical effect rather than a scary one. If only all the remade textures had worked, visually I wouldn't have much to complain considering the age. Everything is just a fistful of polygons, but stuff is at least recognizable most of the time.The controls feel sluggish at times. It's hard to describe what it is, everything just feels numb. The wrench, the few weapons I could try, climbing ladders, running, jumping - the last two were perhaps just a problem in the co-op network code, but they were quite horrible. I watched some speedrun videos, and things looked a bit different. The players were flying through the corridors, but that's not what the average player is going to encounter.I usually dislike the strictly linear nature of modern games. Here things seemed the opposite: you have to go back and forth all the time. The only joy we got from that was when we got lost all the time and laughed about it. The transitions themselves weren't really fun, especially when enemies spawn randomly to the rooms you just cleared. I get it, it's meant to give you this feel that the place is living were you there or not, but it's hard to suspend my disbelief when another service bot just spawned right from nowhere just to annoy the player. In an old school FPS game you are encouraged to explore the non-linear maps, but it's rarely enforced. Here, you reach X just to realize everything was in vain (scripted events), and you have to go back to Y first, and then return to X. It felt mainly tedious.The mechanics will take some time to get into. Nowadays I'm not that patient a player as I used to be, and quirks and small things that as a kid might have seemed cool, felt unnecessary and complex in a bad way. E.g, I figure the weapons breaking only after a few shots is to to discourage the player to shoot'em up through everything, but when you have several skills and items to tackle the problem, it just feels dumb. There are psi skills, software upgrades, implants, but they usually seemed to be just buffs like ""+5 % health"" or something. Things seem very deep, but in the end aren't really, as basically you are shooting stuff either with a psi-amp or weapons, so why not just drop the other. Arguably variability like this adds replay value, and probably you can micromanage yourself a nice ""build"", but for a casual player, it's not entertaining or interesting. It's more like statistics and numbers than tactical choices. There's also currency you can use to buy stuff from vending machines, you can hack the machines to get discounts etc. Ultimately, it's all again just micromanaging, and the unpolished GUI isn't helping a bit.The atmosphere is what everyone mentions as great. The game might have been scary fifteen years ago, but it isn't nowadays. Things felt a bit comical. I don't like survival horror, so it wasn't a good base to begin with, but it was hard for me to imagine suspense here. The audio and visuals have much to do with that, but with the clunky and heavy mechanics it felt hard to get immersed in the world.What makes all this funny is how much I loved BioShock 1 and 2. All the mechanics - psi-skills, hackable vending machines, respawning enemies, audio logs, running back and forth - were there. But most of the time, interface and playability was smooth, there still was a lot of variety for weapon/psi combos. BioShock got things right. I have respect for SS2 in pioneering things, but the truth is, it just isn't enjoyable anymore.On a side note, as some have already mentioned: the Linux version is actually wrapped with Wine, and there is no multiplayer option by default. You have to do some manual work to get it there, and even then you probably encounter some network issues as I did. Eventually I just played using Windows. It might be worth your time to install OpenAL in Windows to get echo effects - it's included in the Linux/Wine version by default, but not in Windows, but I read that you can get it to work.In conclusion, if you want to check out a relic that introduced some new mechanics to the world, do try SS2. You might actually enjoy it. For casual gamers, you're probably a decade late for this ride.			"

												I cannot believe this game would eventually give us the excellent, nearly flawless Bioshock and it's sequels.  I've tried to get used to the unfair, pointlessly difficult AI that you can't hear until you're dead, the turrets that kill you in one shot and basically prevent you from continuing through the game, and the amount of ambiguity of what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go also doesn't help.  Do not go into this expecting a Bioshock game.  I figured I loved the Bioshock series so much I'd give this a shot; I did and I'm sorely disappointed by the results.  I'll wait for SS3 to come out or the HD remaster to drop with improved mechanics and gameplay.  I'm aware the game came out in 1999, so age is sort of working against it, but when your game is being praised as one of the best of its genre, I did expect more.  With that said, I sadly cannot recommend this to anyone who wishes to have any kind of fun playing games.			"

												Meh.Strife was more intesresting even though it was from an older generation.I wouldn't recommend System Shock 2.Dated graphics with seemingly little innovation the game fails to grab one's attention.Even worse is the fact that its positive standing seems to come from the fact that it's ""cool"" & ""retro"" to approve of this nearly 2 decades old game.This trend is so bad that one of the ""most helpful reviews"" is poorly rendered ""art"" using ascii characters.If one wants a good suspense story I recommend Bioshock. If one wants a more intersting story in a game of equal & even higher age, one with elements of espionage & a dystopian future, I recommend Strife. And finall if one wants homicidial computers nothing, hands down nothing, beats the Portal series from Valve.Over all avoid this game; over priced at a whopping $11 in local currancy at a point 17 years after it's release the PUBLISHER is hoping for quick monetary gains while giving little back to the PC gaming community.

												Aged very poorly, with other good games that came out around the same time as this it's hard to recommend this one. No idea why it had such a following, perhaps the eerie atmosphere but the gameplay is dissapointing. Half-life 1 and the original deus ex are both way better games then this.			"

												I consider myself to be a person of few words, so I'll try to keep this short and in small points.System Shock 2 is the sequel I didn't ask for and I sure as hell didn't want either. The blend of FPS-RPG elements seems haphazard at best and very clunky in implementation. The gameplay doesn't help either. The Dark Engine clearly wasn't meant for head-on combat (as exhibited by the Thief games where combat is mostly avoided) but unfortunately the player is forced to combat enemies all throughout the game. The pacing isn't very good either; I spent four hours just trying to get off the first floor I started on. The story is okay in most areas and I did like the concept of The Many, but the ending literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off to no end because it ruined an otherwise satisfying sequence and basically turned the entire game into one big joke. However, the voice acting for characters, the textures, and the sound design was top notch, just like the first game. Now comes the points on why this isn't a very good game and some points on it being good:- Gameplay is clunky and very bad in some areas (guns constantly breaking in the beginning and the middle section of the game, movement is awful and feels very awkward compared to other games at the time, melee combat is also literally the worst thing I have ever experienced in a game like this; I fail to understand how you could be standing in front of someone and miss with a melee weapon, etc.)- Skills are often split into seperate skills for absolutely no reason other than to overly-complicate things (Why is maintenance and repair seperate skills? Doesn't it take some maintenance knowledge to be able to repair something and vice versa?)- Story is alright mostly, but the ending is quite possibly the worst videogame ending I have experienced in quite a long time. (The comedic relief was completely out of place and ruined the whole ending sequence turning the game almost into one big joke.)- Pacing isn't very good. I spent four to five hours just trying to get off the medical / science (and engineering) deck to be able to explore the rest of the damn ship. After finally getting off those floors, the game started to pick up again but falls flat once again once I reached the Command deck and boarded the Rickenbacker. The Many's flesh home also suffers from being terribly boring and monotonous (kinda like Half-Life's Xen section) and also slightly ridiculous at the same time!There are some good things about this game however:- The voice acting is excellent for the time and is top notch just like the voice acting from the first game was.- The textures are great and the level design is alright, but somewhat monotonous as I managed to get lost a few times.- The sound design is excellent, nothing more to say.All in all, this isn't really that great of a game, and I don't understand how this overshadows the first game so much. The first game is superior in literally every way. I might have missed a few things so I might come back and edit this review later.			"

												+ atmosphere+ story is very intriguing+ great mix of variety in upgrades- controls are abysmal. I wanted to play this outside of finding mods that might fix this, but as is it's just so unenjoyable. ""W"" moves forward, ""A"" turns your camera to the left, ""D"" turns your camera to the right, and ""S"" toggles crouch. Peeking around corners is just undoable as you might as well be a backing up truck trying to get back behind cover. Also this makes combat way more difficult than it needs to be. This is my main gripe with the game, so if you can find a way around that you'd probably enjoy it- I'm increasingly surprised at how difficult the combat is. There's no nice ramp up or settling valley with difficulty, it's just ""did you get there first and swing your wrench? no? alright you're probably dead"". I can understand why this game has influenced as much as it has. There's a lot to like here, but the base controls and difficulty work so much against what it tries to build.			"

												I tried very hard to like this game. After 3 hours, I just gave up on it. I know what people say about how great this game was and how important it was in the evolution of game development. The truth is though, this game is broken. They tried to do something different. It failed. Sorry but this isn't a great game - not even a good one. How can a game be good when it is too broken to play? I can see what they attempted to do, and I can see why it was important to the progression of game development. However, I can't see how this is enjoyable to play.EDIT: To elaborate, I say the game is broken not because of some technical issues. It is broken because of the difficulty combined with cryptic class and upgrade mechanics.			"

It could be the difficulty and sense of wandering around that was common in games back then, which I was not used to. Regardless, this was not a game for me.

But now that you've taken off those rose colored glasses and you see it for what it really is. You'll understand that this game may have the hints of a decent game but they've failed on every front to deliver what any dime a dozen AAA game that comes out now can deliver on. The only reason to play this game is to sit down with it and realize that we've come so far and to promptly turn off the game and go play something else.			"

												One of those classics that hasn't aged well at all.  As demonstrated in the Thief games, the dark engine can pull off stealth beautifully, however it falters when it comes to straight up combat (it's floaty, awkward, and really doesn't work as an FPS engine).  Thief 2 wisely avoided combat entirely for this reason, but unfortunately too much of ""System Shock 2"" is just straight up combat. The early portions of the game when you are just getting your bearings and exploring the ship level by level are entertaining enough, but as the game progresses it turns into a much more tedious corridor shooter.  Ammo is scarce, enemies are repetitive and, even worse, they repeatedly respawn. Like Thief, the levels are massive and thus easy to get lost in, but unlike Thief they are not all that varied or well designed.  And as the game progresses too much of your time is spent back tracking over areas you've already covered on tedious object hunts which usually don't amount to much more than cleverly disguised ""find the red, blue, green, etc, etc keys to advance"" style of game play that used to be 1990s FPS' stock and trade.  There are some brilliant ideas here (it has tons of atmosphere, the scarcity of ammo really creates a palpable sense of desperation and fear at times, and Shodan is one of the most memorable and influential video game villains ever for reasons that would probably be too spoilery to go into), but for all its innovation and clever ideas unfortunately the core game play just isn't that fun.

												I heard a lot of good things about this game from some pretty unreliable sources around the time it came out, but I never played it.  I suppose it's not fair to give it an earnest review now that the game is so old, but I'm going to do it anyway.I sort of knew what I was getting into with this one, but I was bored and curious and it was on sale.  Playing this game was sort of like going back and watching Blade Runner for the first time because you heard everyone talking about what an inspiration it was to later science fiction movies.  You could see all of the influences System Shock had on the genre.  You could see the amorphous, rudimentary blobs of creation that would eventually evolve into enjoyable gameplay mechanics in later titles.  You can also see the cancerous growths of an unforgiving and largely cryptic leveling system that punishes you later on if you didn't happen to level the way the game never told you you should.System Shock 2 is a relic of an earlier era.  I would not argue with people who claim that the game was revolutionary for its time, or that it was the progenitor of many of the modern games that I love -- assuredly these assertions are true.  However, I am forced to ask simply, ""Is the game still fun to play?"", and sadly I must answer ""No.""  Ignoring the draconian advancement system, the game feels sluggish and poorly optimized, and the interface is a complicated counter-intuitive mess.  Also, I hate to say it, but the dated graphics seriously hurt the ambiance the game attempts to create.  I've been told that the game can be made less unpleasant through the use of mods, but I simply can't be bothered.  The game is old.  It was probably good for its time, but it's old now.  Let us give it the respect it deserves and allow it to fade into a pleasant, nostalgia-laced cocoon of obscurity.			"

												Now, it isn't often that I found a game difficult to play but this might be because I'm jumping from newer games to a retro game.System Shock 2 was fun at first, but it got old quickly. Now, this is by no means a bad game- there is a ton of story to unravel and there is a wide variety of playing style. Now, since I have the binary ""Yes or no"" options, I'm going to have to say ""no"" to if I would recommend it or not for these reasons (These are why I personally cannot recommend it I should say):1- The graphics, although great for their time, are dated and are hard to follow2- The game requires a great deal of focus and attention to get the most out of it3- Things aren't really explained, security cameras are bad apparently and it's not discussed why that is until its too late4- Weapons degrade with use and repairing them is costly, this might be the ""survival horror"" aspect, but the game feels more like a ""stealth shooter"" than a horror game.I wasn't able to play the game as much as I wish I could. I ended up restarting my game multiple times trying to figure out what play style worked for me and really didn't find anything that suited me. Don't let my review stop you from trying it for yourself, but just be prepared that this is an older game and one of the origional ""immersive horror"" games... it would be like playing the origional Resident Evil game after having played Resident Evil 6- It just has a completely different feel that stands solely on the nastolgia factor.

												I picked this game up becase it is apparently a staple of gaming history, and everyone seems to love it. But when I play it, all I see is a ridiculously complicated upgrade that seem that requires you to be able to see into the future to know what the 20 or so different stats do and why they are useful, and then running through metal corridors pressing buttons and beating alien zombies with a wrench because shooting them with a shotgun is about as effective as tickling them.

												its a straight up first person action game with damage values based on player statistics.then and now, few games are as detailed and lovingly crafted as system shock 2.but i still just rebought this for a dollar to complain how shallow its overall scope is. choose your weapon, go. slay.if your feeling 3d retro and you like dungeon crawling murderfests, this is your ticket. forevery one else; avoid.

												This is the first time I've felt moved to review a game on Steam.  I'm a huge gamer - and I especially love old PC games, challenging games, obtuse games.  But I just can't quite dig System Shock 2.  I tried a playthough doing the PSI route, and it was so insanely hard that I thought I was missing something, or not understanding the rules of the game.  I tried again going the Military route, which was much better, but after a few hours of gameplay I think I've had enough.I love challenging gameplay - I'm a decent gamer.  But there are design issues as far as I'm concerned.  You can save/load anytime you like - but the game is so brutally unforgiving (there are many times you literally can't do anything about just constantly losing health, from radioation or toxins, etc) that it becomes a ""save, load, save, load"" kind of experience.  You can use anti-toxin hypos, but because of the design, its almost better just to reload and try again, because hypos are so ridiculusly rare.  There are places you can regenerate in the game, which seem redundant with the save/load always available.  I invest in maintenence, but there are no repair tools.... like, for HOURS of gameplay.  I invest in repair, but I'm not even sure how I'm supposed to repair things.  I invest in energy weapons, but after so many saves and loads I seem to have left an energy weapon somewhere, so that's out, as I won't see another one for another hour probably.  It's one nonstop annoyance after another, this game, as far as gameplay mechanics. The atmosphere is great, sure.... the story and audio logs are amazing.  I can't think of any other game I was more excited to actually listen to the audio logs you find throughout the world.  The creepy factor is superb. I love the arcade, old-school style challenge.  But the whole ability to save/load at any time sort of undermines the experience.... it's almost just as good to use your wrench and just keep doing save/loads until you get lucky and get through a series of hallways.  I invested in research, and the chemicals I needed were in a DIFFERENT chemical storage room, far away.  Really?  How many dang chemicals are in this game?  Sheesh.  Is it worth it?  It seems to suffer from nerds-designing-games.  It's incessantly complex, but it feels arbitrary.  I'm genuinely confused at the good press and reviews.  I think I actually hate this game on a gameplay level.  I think only if you designed it, you would know how to play it.  This is just my opinion - but I've played games for decades, I'm a fan of tough games from Another World to Dark Souls, Doom to VVVVVV.  But this just feels kind of sloppy and ""save, die, load, save, die, load, save, die.""  I'm sure people will say, you don't know how to play it, or something.... but I actually feel like I don't.  I tried a few times... it went better the second playthrough, but.... I think I'm over it..... just my opinion.			"

												Sucks ♥♥♥♥.The controls are annoying and unintuitive, the pacing is slow as ♥♥♥♥, gameplay consists of beating people with a wrench because there is no ammo anywhere so all your weapons are useless, the RPG elements are way too complex and don't give any feeling of progression, the levels are just a bunch of identical corridors arranged in a maze. I was running in circles and didn't even notice it until several minutes later.On top of that the game is full of death rooms filled with radiation and security cannons that kill you as soon as you enter, which completely discourages any exploration. The voice acting range from passable to god-awful and the graphics haven't aged well at all.I do not recommend System Shock 2. Play BioShock instead, it has much more streamlined and intuitive gameplay. If you must play System Shock 2 I recommend playing on the easiest difficulty and following a walkthrough to avoid getting lost or accidentally upgrading one of the many many many abilites that never will be used in the game.

												Im not sure wether or not this game is good, and unfortunately i will never be able to know for sure. That is because the port of this game is utter ♥♥♥♥. When changing screen resolution, the game freezes and you have to restart you computer. When you start a game, it wont detect your keyboard and mouse, and you have to restart your computer. The reason you always have to restart your computer is because if you alt+tab out of the game, your whole computer is put into some legacy mode and is too glitchy to use.Im very dissapointed, as this game looked really awesome. If there is a fix that i am missing, please let me know so i can change this review.			"

												The story telling and the atmosphere is good well besidethat..Its a damm tedious game...you can really see the ideas and gameplay mechanics that were laterrefined and used in Bioshock and Dead Space Do take note of the word ""refined""My main frustation is that you will definately get lost in the maps with no idea where the hell is a certain place you need to go, andit can take you half an hour plus or maybe an hour to find the place ormaybe you need to press a button to get to an area, but the button is so insignifcantthat you would miss it a few times. (aux storage 5....nerve center...!@#!@$)this lengthens the gameplay a lot as you will revisit the same place over and overto complete the objective, plus you have to deal with respawning enemies, limited ammo and worse..maybe youhave upgraded your ablilities wrongly.I gave up halfway trying to complete it without cheats and an online walk through..hopefully this review helps you			"

												System Shock 2 doesn't hold up particularly well unless you have a decent amount of nostalgia for it. There are plenty of mods to try and bring it up to modern standards, but if you're interested in it purely for an academic understanding of BioShock's predecessor perhaps watch some videos.			"
