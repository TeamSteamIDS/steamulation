												First: Look at these positive reviews. It's either people with around 1k hrs (more or less) or people under 50hrs. My friends and I purchased this game during last years steam sale (after the big content patch).- Playerbase: 30 people worldwide (official and unofficial servers)- Content: You'll hit max level in a week then hit a brick wall in content. Your choices will be to grind badges, grind trash mobs in a dungeon or ""grind new characters so you can grind"" all of the above(Admind told me that). Oh there's a colusseum for pvp/items but the devs have not hosted events in years (see below). Also don't expect new content anytime soon, years maybe. Devs are pre-occupied raising children and that's fine.                  If you started this game when it first opened, the content was way easier up until they patched(Youtube videos of boss battles are dated by years). Content now does not scale with their content patches.  - Classes: Some are useful some are to be carried. Ex: Soldier was a beast 2-3 years ago, after last years patch he gets ko'd in a pillow fight. - Game UI: Simple and easy, they did fine here.They recently merged an official 4 year old pvp server with another official PVP server that started last year when NEStalgia was on sale. The 4 year old server was previously locked as well, so a handful of people had a private server all to themselves. Remember that colusseum pvp/items I was talking about(the devs do not host anymore)? Players from the 4 year old server are decked out in end game pvp gear. YOU can not get this gear. When I asked a MOD about this I was told that I ""should have started 4 years ago"". Their condescension and belittling was a nice touch. Also, the admins and moderators aren't just there to ""help"", they can take part in open world pvp as well. Good to know!If you are new, I do not recommend this game.			"

												I have played this game once it got on Greenlight, and I have to say I fell in love with it. For once, an MMORPG that plays like an old school RPG with simple and nostalgic graphics.There are many servers, but all of them have a low population to have a close knit community, like a family. You're gonna know everyone you see. So you won't be drowned in the crowds. Instead, someone will notice you and you will notice them. If you're interested in what server I started and now playing on, it is Greenlight (Password: Slime).The gameplay introduces you to an opening, just like any other RPG, and slowly introduces you to the battle and the pet system. There are also other quests you can do. It's like World of Warcraft meets Old School RPGs (Don't worry...not the same amount of quests like WoW so stop breathing heavily lol.)The storyline is unique and follows the same feel of classic SNES and NES games. Saving the world, seeing the future, stop corrupting government, etc.The battle is what made me fell in love with this: a balanced turn-based like the Final Fantasy games and Dragon Quest games. It even gives a timer for existing party members to make their move, and to keep the flow going.There are a variety of classes out there. I can't really review on the class balance since I only played one, so I'll review what I learned as a Conjurer. The Conjurer class is a balance between heal overtime and magical damage overtime. Sorta half the effect of a Cleric and a Mage, but hey, you got two powers...gotta find balance there. As a Conjurer, you're gonna need help between your peers and pets combined.Overall, this game is a dream come true for old school rpg lovers who want an mmorpg experience like it. This game is a must have if you like:Old RPG games back in the old daysTurn based battle systemA developing, intriguing story.Simple graphics.Even if it's just one of those reasons, get it.			"

												So, major issues preventing reviewing actual game were resolved.  Mostly just by time and persistently launching the game to check and see if things were fixed.  Go stubborness!So, there's quite a number of endearing things about NEStalgia.  It's a love letter to NES style RPGs and it pulls off a lot of the tropes quite well.  However, some of those very things are things that might mean the game isn't for you unless you *like* those things.  The game world won't take pity on you and neither will many of the players.  They will help and give instruction when it's asked for appropriately but they're fiercely defensive and loyal to the game.  This is both good and bad.  The music is charming and the bits I explored were well done.  There's one early quest if you take the time to make sure you're getting all the quests that I found pretty neat.  If you don't do that and persue just the storyline, you're going to have a bad time.  The skill trees open up at Level 5 and they add a level of depth to the game that makes it worth playing through several times just to play with the different character classes.   I played a bit with both a cleric and a soldier.  They felt sufficiently different from eachother to be enjoyable.  There's 8 different classes to play with and when creating a character you're given several color choices and I believe 3 options for both head and body of the character as well as choices between male and female characters.  I believe there's a lot of depth in the game based just on the character classes alone.  The gameplay is pretty typical of old JRPGs.  Move around, random battles.  One of the larger differences is the ability to recruit monsters you defeat.  It's a pretty neat thing and there's a huge amount of depth here that I've only scratched the surface of.  Something that is probably a plus, but, I didn't quite enjoy is the amount of 'secret passages'.  Occasionally there's a tile that looks off that you can walk right through, and frequently the way to get to a chest you can see is just to walk over background that's normally impassable.   There seems to be a lot of concern about developer censorship and bad moderating behavior, I personally have NOT experienced this, from what I've read in the forum, the dev seems to want to address issues like the ones I experienced; this is a good thing.Then there's the bad.  I brought these up as points of frustration in game and they were defended against solidly by many of the players in game.  It made me leery of voicing further dissent inside the game as it felt like every point I made had to be met with solid defense instead of an 'I understand your frustration, why don't you try X or Y?' which is what's lead to my comments above about people being fiercely loyal to the game.   It creates a slightly inhospitable atmosphere.  So, first there were the account creation issues, the fact that it errored when trying to originally link my steam account was one of the things that initially lead me to be leery of further things in the game.  This was eventually resolved, but, it's something to keep in mind that you may have issues getting the game going.  Actual in game issues.  The movement lag mentioned by others is there, I was able to cope, but, it was noticeable.  Entering the starter town from the east would often spit you right back out of town, not game breaking, but, frustrating on top of some of the other issues as well.  In fights, the fights are slow paced, so I often had the habit of just tapping '1' to attack, attack first monster, repeat.  After a while however, the game started warning me about spamming.  I was eventually booted by the 'bot detection'.  It's sort of understandable, but, I'd rather have an 'auto-fight' option if I can't just tap the key, if this option does exist, it wasn't immediately obvious to me.  The pacing of the game felt off to me, and as I said above, if you just try to head for the story, you'll have a bad time as the monsters exceed your power quickly and some NES era difficulty raises it's head.  There is not much context if any that this kind of thing will happen, and when it does it didn't feel very fair to me.  That being said, death has little to no consequences that I noticed, and you're simply revived at the last town.  The game is a BYOND game that does not mention it's a BYOND game.  This is a negative that actually goes both ways though.  Even though I view it as negative, the fact that the game has production values good enough that it doesn't seem obviously like one, is a huge credit to the staff.  However, if it had been marketed as a BYOND game and clearly mentioned it, I would never have purchased the 3 pack of it.  The marketing and style of the game had me sold, but, I ended up feeling deceived.So, what's all this huge wall of text mean?  Honestly, if I could walk away from this with a 'Neutral' vote instead of a thumbs up or thumbs down I would.  However, it does directly ask a question, Do you recommend this game?  No, I do not.  I think the overall gaming experience for the majority of people in my social circle would be negative.  There are those that love this style of thing and would love the quirks as much as anything else, but, that's not me.   I tried to list good and bad things about the game and everyone else can use their best judgement to decide if the game is for them or not.			"

												I had never heard of this game before the Steam release. I picked up the 3 pack early just to give it a whirl and gave 2 copies to some friends of mine. For those of you that don't want to read the whole review, I'll just come out and say that I absolutely love the game. One of the better games I've played so far in 2014. My friends and I have had a blast playing it, and if that isn't the bar for what constitutes a good game, it should be. That being said, not everyone will love it. Read on to see if this isn't your bag.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is highly reminiscent of the Dragon Warrior games or the early Final Fantasy games on the NES. If that last sentence instantly sets off bells of nostalgia for you, then you will probably like this game. Don't run out and buy it yet though! The game is deliberately 8 bit and old school, where you walk around a 2d world getting into random encounters that pop up out of nowhere. The point is to level, hope for rare drop loot, and beat bosses at the bottoms of dungeons to complete quests.The battle is where this game shines especially if you have two friends. And that is also this games biggest weakness. The game is still fun solo, but the companion monsters from your ranch (think having a stable of pokemon), are usually sufficient enough but stupid. This not only lowers the fun of enacting well crafted plans with your friends so that all of your moves play out in perfect turn order like a well choerographed bank heist, but also makes certain battles very difficult. The point is, if you go this solo, there may still be points where you'll want to group up with someone else in the world.Beyond that, battles often get tough and intense where your life might hang in the balance of which member of your party a monster attacks or if your healer has enough agility to get his heal in before the monster gets his bite in. The battles are pretty fast paced and can swing from good to bad quickly. The battles also reward strategic thinking, but it is possible to brute force your way through much of it just by grinding out another level or two if things get tough. The combat is definitely where this game shines.CLASSES:There are 8 classes that all play differently from eachother. Some of the classes are similar in style and role but still manage to maintain their identity. I have personal experience with the Warlock, Conjurer, Wizard, and a ranger that I specced to play like an offensive lightning slinging druid. All 4 were casters, yet no two were alike. The conjurer is all about damage over time and can heal almost as well as he can kill while the Wizard takes more of a straightforward approach and just hits stuff upside the head for huge single hit numbers with fireballs and the like. The warlock life drains constantly and uses his own HP to cast instead of mana while the Ranger almost always goes first in combat due to high agility, can hit things upside the head with his staff for a respectable amount of damage to save mana on trash, and could still chuck around heals and spells with fairly strong results.THE STORY:Something about time travel. Who cares? I wouldn't call story this game's strong point. It's there, but it hasn't exactly left me pining for a tie in novel.FINAL RESULTS:The good:+ Fun MMO-like game set in a old school NES RPG setting.+ Great fun with 2 friends+ Can still be fun solo, but may require grouping at points.+ Combat is excellent and nail biting+ Classes are well designed and play differently from eachother+ Terrible graphics that pleasantly remind us of a bygone era.The Bad:- Some battles are nigh-unsoloable. (lookin at you Guardian)- Can get a bit grindy at times.- Terrible graphics that remind you of nothing because you weren't gaming in the 80s.- The boat ride between Balzackia and Piatta can't be skipped after the first time :(- Story is nothing to write home about.

The community is awesome, always helpful and kind.  1893 hours of play time @ review and i still have lots of classes to build differently and complete.

												I hesitate to leave a review because I very likely bought this game for the wrong reasons...  I don't in any way care for the idea of having multiplayer in this sort of game, but the prospect of a fun single player campaign appealed to me so I figured i'd try it out just for that.  I assumed it might be hard to solo, but I like a challenge so I figured bring it on.  Long story short, there's just nothing here for me.  2 hours in and I am bored to tears with the slow, painfully simple combat and cliche questing.  I played Dragon Warrior back in the day, and even revisited it recently, but even that game didn't feel as slow or grindy.  It's obvious all the effort went into the multiplayer aspect, and really I shouldn't be surprised since that's the whole focus of this title, but I just wish there was the single player was a bit better.  The nail in the coffin for me was the fact that the chat window (which you can't remove even when offline as far as I know) booted me out of my own game 4 times in a row for ""spamming"" in my own offline game.  I'm sorry but that really chapped my♥♥♥♥♥FYI, the stuttering other reviews mentioned is gone in the latest version, so for those interested in the multiplayer I'd say go for it.  The multiplayer people are probably having a blast.  If you just happen to interested in this for the single player like I was though, just keep moving.			"

												NEStalgia feels like a solid RPG, aside from minor issues...A couple aspects of the game that I immensely enjoyed are for one, the fact that you are able to fight battles with other players online: Co-op or PVP (I would highly recommend playing online), and for two, optional side quests aside from the main story. As for feeling like a solid RPG, the player stats and levels seem well designed.One minor thing is that you have to use an external program, such as JoyToKey, in order to use ""Gamepad Mode"". This may or may not change with future updates.Another possible issue is that you may need to do a bit of grinding in order to level up; it really isn't that bad, though. (Teaming up with other players may make it easier)Overall, the music & sound effects are great, the graphics are nice, and the overall gameplay is enjoyable.			"

												NEStalgia is a fantastic game. I was skeptical at first; $15 seemed a hefty price tag for what seemed to be nothing more than another dime-a-dozen RPG packaged as ""retro."" I decided to buy it spontaneously, and I'm glad I did. It's incredibly fun, and the hours seem to disappear. My one complaint regards the inactivity of the online community--the largest server generally has ~20 players online at any time. The last time any were active was the initial release on Steam, and the numbers have been dwindling since. It would be nice to see a sale to increase the number of players.If you would like to try the game before purchasing it, you can download it on Silk Games' website. You will, however, be limited to a single-player demo.			"

												NEStalgia has that classic 8-bit and 16-bit RPG feeling it. The graphics and sound remind players of the days of legendary classics of Dragon Warrior (Quest) and Final Fantasy. Yet, the game suffers from a lot of hindsight that may turn gamers away.The game, as it stands, is not balanced. Each class feels unique, but it becomes painfully clear which characters are more valueable then others. It does allow you to collect monsters and have them fight with you, but the AI of the monsters are subpar at best. Where, they should be healing the party for a large amount of health, they will attack doing slim to no damage. This is even after trying to make sure the monster solely does their healing spells.The story is pretty solid. There is a lot of going from Point A to Point B, allowing not much exploration. But, there are some places to find, visit, and hidden away. The small sub-stories would've been nice to explain some of the smaller areas to help the world feel a bit more alive. Yet, my largest complaint comes from this area as well. Once the snow area is cleared, the story just stops. There is no, congratulations, no saving the princess, no princess in another castle. The story just hits a brick wall that ends up making the game feel unfinished. The Endgame is there, but the playerbase isn't. Finding groups are pretty easy when leveling. However, when tackling the end game content, it feels extremely lacking and problematic. I don't know if it is the community or just the devouring of content. But, the game just felt a bit lackluster at the end it keep the playerbase reeled in.Overall, I would honestly advice avoiding the game until the developer polishes, balances, and learns how to retain high end players. I'm not saying that the game is bad. It is by no means a bad game. It's just missing that small flame it needs to start the fireworks. Until then, I would say put it on your wishlist, wait, and see.			"

												I also tried hard to like this game. Coming from the position of someone who is trying to make my own games, I am often left scratching my head at the design choices. It's almost like this game is intentionally bad.-This game advertises itself as a mesh between Dragon Warrior and World of Warcraft. It seems to assume the latter mantle based on it's use of a talent system. While these talents seem interesting at first blush as you attempt to create a build, etc.; In funtionality they change little about the repetitve game play, and there is one clear way to go which will yield the ""strongest"" character.-Instead of this game being a love-letter to games of old with modern improvements that enhance the experience, it is a reminder of the frustration that comes from unrefined gaming experiences.-The art just is. It works. Same with the sound. The feedback the player craves is glossed over. I can get behind this type of game if the game-play substitutes it(a la Dwarf Fortress), but here it does not.-Ultimately this game is aptly titled. If you are desperate for nostlagia, go for it, but as another reviewer has mentioned, you will probably feel more rewarded using an old console or an emulator.-The $15 price tag is to maintain the empty server, this is a $5 game hiding behind MMO buzzwords.

												So were to start, I was an avid wow player for years and have been looking for something I could really dive in too for awhile.  This game is that game I have been searching for, I am a Guild leader on Midgard and I love the time I have spent playing this game and the people I have met playing it.  The servers are small so you get to know and be a part of a community of great players.  I would encourage anyone to try this game young or old, its easy enough to grasp and alot of fun to play.  Simple graphics and gameplay make me take a walk down memory lane everytime I log on.  To those that didn't grow up in the area of 8-bit gameing its a chance to taste that time.  I welcome anyone to give my server a try, you wont be disapointed.  NEStalgia is just top notch.  Also the forums are very fun to read and a handy guide and reference.   http://silkgames.com/forum/  Also Midgard is locked right now, but if you see this review and want to join just message my Steam account and I can get you the Password.

Take it from somone who has spent countless hours on this game. ""game lag"" that some people complain about really is not an issue. if you are having constant connection issues it is your internet NOT the game.

												NEStalgia is an MORPG that takes me back to the early days of my gaming life. You play in a world very similar to Dragon Warrior, with turn-based battles, quest chains, and multiplayer parties to adventure and fight with. You can recruit monsters to fight with you and solo if that is your preference. The servers are small in scale and there are cliques, but people seem friendly. Expansions and updates are free, after you purchase the full game, which is always a good deal for a fun game. You also host private servers just for your friends. If you enjoy retro RPG's, you are going to love this game.			"

												After searching for reasons to like this game, I came up short.Perhaps my biggest complaint about this game is its lack of convenience features. In a time where games provide many tools as standard, this one lacks those in such a way where it feels like a mistake/grievance as opposed to intentional difficulty.- The game forces you to grind. Sometimes, you can walk a mere 5 steps before being aggro'd again. - Steep EXP incline. I noticed that the first 10 levels were fairly simple, but as I rose beyond that, it took increasingly long to level up. What made this harder was...- Monster EXP doesn't scale. Travelled to a new area with significantly harder monsters, and gained the same EXP.- Irregular monster difficulty. No joke- in one area, you can be hit for 6 damage by one enemy, or your whole party can be burned for 12-16 damage each by another.- Tiny community. Everyone talks and tries to help when possible, but there are usually 10-15 people online. Don't expect to find people to actually play with unless you bring a friend.- Terrible UI / chat boxes. Not fluid in the slightest, which only seemed to drag out fights and conversations even longer.Many small things like this summed up to make this entire game less of a wonderful way to reminisce and more of an incitement of frustration.Save yourself the $15 and plug in your old console the next time you need some nostalgia.

												I've been playing this game a lot lately with two of my friends.  We've had a lot of fun so far.  It's a real throwback to classic RPGs.[Update] I haven't really played more of this game, but I still like it.  A real drawback is one of our 3 has been unable to play with us, and the game isn't much fun without a full party.  You get an AI on your team, and you can kind of guide it on how to play, but you can't directly pick what it does every turn.  It gets frustrating, as opposed to having a party of 3, where you can coordinate instead of hoping each of you picks the right move.			"

												Pros: What May Attract You -Multiplayer turn based fighting RPG! How many retro turn based games can boast have this? Grab two friends and get gaming.Two skill trees for each of the many classes creating custom play style. Join the debate on which build you think is best.Pets you can capture and level up; so many even Ash would feel at home.Refined play style is not realized until you match gear, skills, ability seeds, and pets for a unique experience.Many hidden secrets/paths!!! This game rewards exploration!Great community - Amazing and friendly community. I have never had a hard time finding at least one person with a char my level and looking for fun. This community is committed and strong.PvP for the competitive players.Still actively, albeit slowly, being worked on by the devs. This game is far from being cast aside. Thank you devs for loving this game as much as I do!Cons: The Full Disclosure -Very repetitive game play in early game. I promise you it gets better. If you like old turn based games, it is worth sticking it out.Farming is a must. For some, this alone is a deal breaker. However I find that this mechanic keeps the game true to the RPG genre and enjoy.Solo play on this game can be rough going as built-in game features give noticeable bonuses encouraging grouping.Limited combat animation. Lack of animation attacks can at times leave combat feeling bland. Again, this is meant to mirror older games and can easily be overlooked. This is especially true when you come across a never before seen monster whose sole attack is to slowly tic down for some unknown attack. (Play to find out what it does)Server size - This truth hurts. Servers hold about 30 people and usually only one of the two servers is actively used. With that said, I want to point out that it is exceedingly rare for that sever to be filled with less than 18 people.			"

												This game is fairly fun. It entertained my brother and I for a good month or two, but the game is practically dead. Not many people really play it, and players are quick to trash talk you if you mention something you don't care for about the game.Overall, however, there are puzzles that you must solve in order to get to the next area of the game. Unfortunately, they are clunky and next to impossible, expecially since lag spikes happen non stop. This alone makes the game not fun.The end game is also non-existent for newer players, as the area is too hard, and unless you are experienced in the end game dungeon, it is highly likely that no one will want to party with you.If you have a friend who will play this with you, and you both like to grind nonstop, then this game is for you. If not, then I personally don't suggest buying this.			"

												It's basically a Nes game with MMO elements. You have several diverse classes with skill trees, you can play with friends and recruit monsters to help, something that i think is REALLY lacking in Rpgs. In other words, you can be a warlock using your hp to perform powerful attacks that heal you more than hurt you and be a pokemon master at the same time, bringing 2 strong monster allies. You can build your team in anyway you can, such as having a really strong monster healer, a physical tank that takes all sorts of damage and crushes the opposition, while you're using magic, firing arrows or being another tank yourself. Whatever the strategy, NEStalgia has you covered.Just don't mind the random battles...			"

												This is a really good game, It's like dragon warrior and dragon warrior monsters were put together in an MMORPG setting with some quality puzzles put into it so it's not all just grinding. Majority of community is good, character selection is great and still more to be added, there is definitely replayability in this game as you can have a ton of slots for new characters to go through story with and with different people or monsters if you choose. And if you like gambling theres a casino in 2nd half of game :PSome downsides are when it's really busy there can be a few lag spikes, nothing too serious. After a certain point in game you need to start working with others cause monsters will have difficulty with strong bosses so it becomes really difficult to solo. Overall i'd give this game a 8.5/10			"

												This game plays a lot like a old RPG from the 8-bit era. The screen transition is even faithful to games of that time. That is some attention to detail.It has both offline and online. The online servers that are listed on the lobby in its launcher have only a few dedicated players. Which pretty much makes it very much like the offline. Except with that little extra of having someone around to ask for help if needed.The classes are very well done. I have only experienced merchant. From what I have seen some things are locked until you reach a certain level. The skill tree isn't accesible until level five. I wasn't even for sure it existed. Even if there was a picture of it on the store page. The skills were all merchant themed. The all had merchant style names and matching abilities. I spent probably ten minutes just looking through the skill trees.I have seen many attempts at a 8-bit style massive multiplayer game. I even played a few of them. This is the first one I have come across that looks to have done it right. It doesn't do fancy. It doesn't do complicated. It just does 8-bit level MMO.Very much worth the purchase. I already feel like I have gotten my moneys worth, and know that I will be getting plenty more out of this game. I didn't think I would recomend this game when I first launched it. Now I will gladly recomend it, and at least make sure that at least one other person buys it.(sorry about the spoiler allerts. They are just things I think are best found out for ones self. I used to think the more a person knows going into a game the better. Now I want to go in a game blind and unknowing. I left the notes their for those that don't think that way though.)			"

												NEStalgia is a interesting game and one I am glad was made, as a call back to the RPG's of old they decided to do everything in their power to take that and make it into a online experience, and it worked. In NEStalgia you play as ""Create a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hero #492-231"" to save the world, the game allows three party members, one of which is you and the other two are either monsters you can recruit to help you on your quest, or fellow players/friends who created their own dip♥♥♥♥♥ to help you save the world.First off I am going to start with the negatives, they decided to make this based off the RPG's of old however because of that the game is also a massive grind fest, the first non tutorial boss in the game is near impossible to kill if you are the kind of people who just likes to go from point A to point B without any training. The only other problem I have, although this is a nitpick, is that you can never disable the chat (or I just never found the button to disable it).The game looks great, the 8 bit graphics are really well made and it is easy to tell which is which. The combat is fun and is even more fun with friends to back you up. There are several classes in the game all with two skill tree's so you can easily pick what style of play you want.The game is great for those who love 8 bit RPG's or just RPG's in general, if you are looking for something to play for a long weekend I say you should try this game out.9/10			"

												This game is pretty good in my opinion sure some classes suck in the beginning but later on they're pretty solid, you may think it's a grindfest but that's really only when you don't have friends to play with, the community on the official server that i've played on was pretty good and help you if you ask for it, unless they're way above your level or something because if it's a 7 level difference you don't get exp or they might be across the other side of the world, for me i only come across lag like 1 every 2 hours or so and that's like just a 3 second lag spike, sure the movement is abit weird, seems like you glide but honestly I can't find anything terrible about this game, and for those of the reviewers that are saying you're running out of mp as soon as you cast a few spells, you haven't gotten far then. It's main feature though is playing with other people, heck you can duel and there's forced pvp servers also. Overall great game. that is alll, thanks for reading my first review, as of posting this i have 60 hours spent on this game, felt like pointing that out also most of the reviews I saw were only like 3 hours in, it doesn't truly shine until like level ten in my opinion, yes bye now.

												I have played this game since  before it was on Steam.  I have put more hours in it than I am comfortable admitting.  If you enjoyed the original JRPG games (DQ/FF/etc.), then you will enjoy it.  It gives alot of hommage to it, as well as putting little lines in dialogue that any geek will enjoy.  (Why yes I am a little short to be an Ardanian soldier.)  It has the best online community that I have found in a game to date.  However if your goal is to just beat a game and go onto another, this game is probably not for you.  Most of the content is in mastering several different classes and tweaking them until they match your playstyle.  I have never played a game that I want to replay as often.			"

												I want to really like this game since it has a lot of great mechanics, fun co-op play, and my friends and I are really enjoying it... when it works.  Recently, the game has had continuous connection problems and the dev can never be reached.  It's like he doesn't care.  Constant disconnects mid-dungeon will have you shrieking with rage, especially when you respawn IN TOWN, half your gold is gone, you have only 1 MP for some reason, and you have to start the entire bloody dungeon over again.  Especially when you're really far in and trying to recruit a rare monster.  And that's if the game doesn't freeze in the middle of battle with said monster or, worse, freezing when you're about to recruit said monster.  So you respawn in town WITHOUT THE RECRUIT.  This is unacceptable!If it's server issues, they need to be fixed.  If the dev is doing this on purpose, he's only ruining the good name his game has.I want to give this game a positive review, but with the most recent issues, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.EDIT: Thanks to the dev for getting back to me and informing me of what was going on.  When my friends are around, we'll give the game another shot.  Should the server issues be fixed so we can play and enjoy the game, I will write a new review.			"

Yes please.Unfortunatly the performance and design choices make it impossible to enjoy playing.Moving around the world hitches every tile you move. It's impossible to keep a steady framerate without crawling across the world. Players are unable to keep menus open when the party leader is moving, leaving you nothing to do but enjoy the alternating frames of the overworld as you walk along. Party members don't get to see the quest dialogue or actually interact with the world in any way. It completely cheapens the experience and makes me wonder why I'm even here. The idea is great, but very poorly executed.			"

												I've spent my share of time playing this and got fairly close to beating it before my friends ran out of steam and we decided to pick up something more... fun.That's the problem with this game. It never even attempts to act as if it was a particularly involving game and this becomes especially apparant when playing with multiple friends, sharing a party together. Perhaps we've all become too impatient with our games, expecting more active battle systems and a gripping story to follow along, but as a review from someone who's put in almost 100 hours into the game, I can, with some authority, say that the game is very, very dull.Perhaps 20% of the fun of the game came from decisions being made in combat. Another 10% came from the very few decisions you get to make when progressing your character. 0% for story and exploration, and the rest 70% of enjoyment comes from just hanging out for hours with your friends. If you had decided to just talk about random things with 2 of your buddies in a chat room someplace, you'd be having 70% of the enjoyment of this game.The long hours you spend exploring with friends (no matter how hard you try to keep progressing, it will take very long) are exasperated by slow movement, slow exploration, dull monsters and queststasks; and it quickly becomes a chore to even take your turn in combat. You quickly find that you play this game with a more interesting game in another window playing simultaneously and only return to take your turn because you would feel bad about making your friends wait. That's the sort of chore this game becomes. As much as I'd have loved to love this game and would have even more liked to say I completed it, I realize that even if I did, I wouldn't be able to say it was worth it at the end. The finale was as boring as the 90-hour road leading up to it. And those were 90 hours each from myself and another 2 of my friends playing together, their experiences so poor that they didn't even feel like finishing it. I would never wish this experience upon anyone and thus cannot, in good faith, recommend this game to anyone, no matter how patient or enduring they might be. Just because they might be able to play it, doesn't mean they could drag their friends kicking and screaming through such a slog.			"

												I haven't had this much fun with a single game in nearly a decade. Certainly the best MMORPG I've had the pleasure of playing, and perhaps the best RPG overall... Perhaps. Read the descriptions, review the screenshots, check out http://nestalgiawiki.com, and if by then you're not convinced (like I was), you can still download the game and play on a trial account (which I heard maxes at level 10) on your own local server. Naturally though, the full paid account is multitudes more fun, the trial account is just a taste. Personally, I was very intrigued once i hit level 5, hooked by level 7, and since then I haven't looked back to any other game I used to play regularly!			"

												NEStalgia is a perfect throwback to 8-bit RPGs of the 80's with a decent amount of modern day MMORPG funcionality. Seriously this game has it all: A very well written storyline with some comedy, adventure and deceit throughout, a well rounded cast of playable characters each with their own development, a companion system for solo play or grouping options to take on enemies with friends, a pleasant and helpful community (at least on my server; Malice :pp) and copious amounts of nostalgia to make older fans of the original JRPGs fall in love. But younger gamers can still find something to enjoy in this amazing title as it grows and develops with the help of the community. Seriously, buy it!			"

Thought it would be a cute, easy game for us to play.Turns out not only do we love it, but there is a whole lot more here than I had first thought. My wife even started playing, and now the three of us delve dungeons, solve puzzles in town, and overthink pet names.I highly recommend this game to anyone who once played or loved the old Dragon Warrior or FInal Fantasy classics, or just for someone who wants a new take on a light mmo. There is plenty here to justify the cost and much fun to be had!			"

												Warning to anyone looking at this game. If you have senstivity to flashing lights or get headaches to flashing, or are just generally annoyed at everything flashing on a frequent basis then avoid this game.The game currently has a bug which has been stated on the offical forms more than once with the V1.7.0 update and (at writing of this review) hasn't been acknowledged by the dev. The bug is that if you disable either battle or overword flashes  the game corrups and freezes.Now on to the actuall review:Summarry incase you didn't want to read the whole thing:All in all the game is meh. I woudn't say bad but I wouldn't say it is good.To me it takes nestagia and milks it without regard for advancing anything in a meaningful way.Pass for now but don't forget it exsits.Full Review:Mechanics: The mechanics of this game are simple and slightly refined, I would say that simplicity to this game as a throwback to when games didn't need 30 different commads or button presses to do 1 move in battle is what is aluring in this game but the added functions of the skill trees and the companions feel thrown in and unrefined, there is much more potential in thoes systems expecally the companion system. One thing I would change is the ability of actually using the companions in combat instead of setting them on an auto play based on a behavor. Not much else to say here other than the crafting is semi cool but the restriction of dmg based of a particular elemental stat is not needed.Graphics: Well not much to say here, pixle graphics... if you like that sort of thing.Game Pace: Here is a rough one. The pace of the game is really really really slow and is horribly dependent on which class you choose which speed you go. I found the game way to grindy for my pace and I was playing with a friend which made it better, but due to the bug mentions before this review he got sick from the flashing and had to quit.All in all I would say if your looking for some nestagia for the old school games you might be better off waiting on this or playing some of the other old school like games. The creator has an expansion on the horrizon so maybe the game will get better overtime but I would avoid for now but keep on the radar.			"

												This game is basically, like it says, a call back to old snes rpgs, like dragon quest, with a lot of tounge in cheek humor which i can't help but love. the other players are almost always nice and helpful no matter what questions you ask them, and its USUALLY easy to party up with a group, which is prefered to than using actual monsters in battle since they follow a better form of the old dragon quest 4 system of ""attack based on the tactics you give them"" approach, though you can always assure one thing with monsters, they won't attack what you're attacking unless its the last one left, kinda like weaking the opposition tactics, but what monsters are really there for are reserve bonuses...you join a party with two other players and your monsters give you boosts which is very helpful usually. i've got 90 hours logged into it so i can say for sure its an amazing game..just gotta wait for the next expansion to come out, but if you get it here on steam its free along with the other job classes besides the basic four you would normally have.

Probably the most best game, gameplay wise that my hp mini can play. Apart from the low reqs graphs just give a nice retro feel, and sound gets you right in the feel of playing on an 8bit console. Now to the best part the gameplay is absolutely great, there is a pet system, quests got ! and ? signs like in modern mmos, story is interesting and you keep saying to yourself ""I need to advance a bit further"" when you realise there is hours since you last said it to your self and you are still playing, lol.

The designer is busy with his new children which is understadable. Don't expect to be doing much when you reach level cap. The story doesn't finish, and you grind gear. You can start a new character so that you can grind better at level cap though. Grind Grind Grind!			"

												Ignore the hours on record - that's an inaccurate representation of how much I've played this game.I started playing in 2013, back when it was Free to Play and Algol was still around. At first I was skeptical because a guy from another game I was playing had told me ""come on this game!"", so I went and joined. It seemed boring at first - having to ""farm"" for XP and Gold, until I managed to get to Balzackia. That's the place where the storyline becomes pretty clear.In 2013 I managed to max out my Soldier as level 32. But it's still fun, because you have the Warrior's  Crypt, the Black Sanctum, and the Shade to kill, all of which is hard even for level 32s. Plus, they're still working on a contant expansion to increase the length of the game.All in all, I love this game and highly recommend it.(Note: My hours on record isn't accurate because I was playing in 2013, when it wasn't on Steam and you had to download it off the website.)

												NEStaliga is one of these weird 8bit games that starts you out slow but the more you play the more you get sucked into it. Unlike most mmo's this one is a very hard one seeing that in the early game can just devistate you if you don't have any help at all. One of these places is the crypt which has a boss that has 4 elemental phases you need to knock out before you can even touch the boss.You are better of just grinding at the noob spot til you are 10 by going to the bandit cave and do not forget to pick up the quest that needs you to get 10 maskes, it does not matter if there are 5 character that drop the item you can only get 1 of the quest items per battle. The community for this game is very small i'd say around 100 players and well the server current has max 11 players on one server. Pretty spooky, but they are a nice bunch...  Oh yeah this game has a wiki, pretty sweet huh?I do recommend this game, but please reconsider if you want to play a mmo where you ♥♥♥♥♥ your character out as much well.... this game is not to do it in.... everything is 8bit and well... only thing you could change is like a mask on your face, then this game is not for you... I highly recommand final fantasy online due to it's roleplay community... met someone who was called BareRock Obama.... he was pretty badass.			"

												I've played this for a few hours now and I've got to say, it's not half bad. It actually covers quite a bit I've been wanting to see in a video-game since I was very young. Multiplayer Turn-based games are few and far between, and even rarer are ones that will allow you to play the storyline together. The best way I can sum up this game is Dragon Warrior Monsters with drop-in/drop-out multiplayer over the internet.Now, this game is far from perfect... They could still use a lot of polish on the questing (it really feels rushed and limited in the early levels), and the grind is kind of lopsided when the monsters are almost 5-10 levels apart in challenge by area, but overall it's really good. The inclusion of a marketplace is great, but unless you're playing on a populated server (and the server I'm playing on isn't populated) then it's all but dead.So, do I recommend this game? Yes... But it needs a lot of work. Perhaps if a ton of people buy it and play it, they'll invest a little more effort into making it worth our time. As for right now, it seems kind of like a niche thing where only nostalgia-minded folks who want to team up with a few buddies will want to play.Also, maybe allow for four players? Three is nice, but four is more and rhymes are... Something that rhymes with rhymes and is synonymous with preferable. Limes? No, that doesn't make sense...			"

												This game is a solid 8/10. I like how you can host your own server if you feel that you don't want to play with the world abroad and it has that good ol' solid 8-bit RPG feel to it. Some of the things I didn't care for though were the choppy scrolling through the world *which I later found was because of the use of Byond for the creation* and also the wonky controls. You can never fully use the keyboard or use the mouse but are stuck at using both which is wierd for a Byond game. Also, its a Byond game... if you can't stand those, certain things about this will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. If you haven't already been scarred by BYOND and like games like Dragon Warrior alot, then give this a try when it goes on sale or you have $15 to throw to the wind...			"

												Hi all, I am taking some time away from the game to write this initial review. After spending 2 hours doing some quests with my brother and now just exploring on my own, I have reached level 5 and Nestalgia became a real game - The Skill Tree was unlocked!I am a ""Builds"" sort of guy and all these options intrigue me. (I am playing a Merchant btw) This is definitely a plus point for me, with the apparent depth overcoming the first 4 levels when I was doing basic attacks and a couple of abilities.A slight downer for me is the party system where the other players in the party just follow you, and cannot move independently. I am not too sure how to implement an active party system though (maybe a proximity system whereby only when you are within a certain amount of squares, then the party is considered active again?)The 8-bit graphics are fine for me, and there is no lag on the official server (I am on Midgard). Looking at the whole picture though, this game is for the niche crowd or the discerning gamer who can look past the superficial and enjoy what this little strategic gem has to offer. I will write a more in-depth review again after I experience more of this game. But I do recommend it, if you like the trailer and a good strategic workout.Cyall in the game! :)~ "

If you like old school rpgs, you will love this game.The graphics and playstyle is exactly what you would expect from the better end of NES 8 bit rpgs like dragon warrior 3 or FF1.  Except this time around your working as a team with other players.  The servers are on the small side 50ish or less people at any given time which is good and bad.  Good because you will consistantly see the same people and have a real community.  Bad if you can't find someone around your level to party with.  But even then the Companion system is effective at making solo play enjoyable.Overall i give a 4/5			"

												NEStalgia This game is a game I have dreamed about since youth, an MMO RPG with Monster collecting. With steam flooded with subpar JRPGS, NEStalgia is a diamond among coal. Whether you play in your own world with friends using the super simple server hosting or you play on the Official Multiplayer Server this game is fun for all. Pros ~~~The Official Server is by far one of the best thing about this game, being able to connect with people anywhere at any level is fantastic. The community for this game is wonderful. Everyone is helpful and pleasant. Not only can you PVP, and party up to PVE, there are several other multiplayer features that rise NEStalgia above others including a players market, guild creation, private local world guild and party chat, daily events, and much more.Pets!!! Farm monsters to fight along side you or give reserve bonuses just from being there. 2 ways to use the pets allows most if not all to be relatively useful. Unlike some games where only a handful of classes/ monsters matter because of strength differences. Extensive gameplay and character design. Skill trees are extensive, the mathematics behind the game tweaked with updates to create fair and balanced gameplay between classes and the rest of the world. Even after reach max level there are still a plethora of things to do and accomplish and several end game dungeons meant for characters not only of max level but max gear and strategy.Nice map design. As you progress through the story and the map unfolds it seems vast, but was designed so that travel between areas takes no time at all once quests are completed. Revisit old places and areas with ease while exploring a vast world with many secrets and puzzles. Promises of updates, even if they are slower than hoped. (also seems like this dev actually cares about their game :)Cons ~~~You will have to grind against random number generators for items, and then gold/exp of course.(But I mean that’s what sets rpgs apart from point and click >.>)You will have to grind allot more if you want to survive in later parts of the game on your own. It can be done, especially early - mid game, but I do find myself wishing for a single player area.			"

												This game has such potential, such a good idea. It's how they executed it that really kills the experience. Maybe my review will change in the future as the game is developed, but as for now I'll have to give it a thumbs down.PROS:    - 8-Bit Art and Music    - Very similar to the original Dragon WarriorCONS:    -Very laggy. This game is basic enough to run on Windows 95, but they still managed to ♥♥♥♥ a constant frame rate.    - 3 servers, and about 12 players. There's an average of 12 players on the game at all times, but it's still advertised as a ""Massive Multiplayer Online"" RPG.     - Child-Like writing    - Majorty of things are just different shades of black and blue.SUMMARY: This is a♥♥♥♥♥♥online game with a microscopic playerbase, that's very overpriced. 2/10			"

												Very very fun game. Started off doing the quests, got a spider companion, and we set off on our adventure. Very shortly afterwards, meet some other players, and we made our way into our first dungeon. Insanely great time. We were chatting, having fun, discussing plans when we came across the final boss, found tons of secret rooms, and that was only in the first part of the game! As you progress, not only are there ton's of secrets to discover, but there's tons of companion combination if you're playing solo. If you decide to team up with some other players, your current companions basically ""Vanish"" while your partner takes your pets spot. Your pet then begins to give you a passive buff! Which can range from anything to increased Strength, to more healing recieved in battles, to even abilities that can be casted during fights! Great game, a must for any RPG/dungeon gamer.			"

												Before purchasing this game you have to ask yourself 2 questions. Was I alive when the NES was alive and kicking and did you love Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy for the NES. If the answer to both those questions are yes, then this game is for you and will keep you addicted for hours and hours.If your first reaction to my 2 questions are what is Dragon Warrior and why is this game turn based. Turn Based RPGs are horrible. You can safely skip this game it is not for you. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of NES rpgs though. The developers did a great job with this game. It really feels like playing one of the original Dragon Warrior games on the NES. With a few modern twist on the formula like skill trees, character customization, etc.			"

Just within a class there are builds that you can do which adds lots of replayability. Not to mention there are many classes which each play very differently. Also the community is really nice and fun. I haven't had much trouble picking up a person around my level and working with them for a bit. If you can get a friend to play it with you then you are even better. Is rly gud get it if you think you would like it.			"

Posted: December 5, 2015
												I started playing in 2011, so I actually have a thousand or two more hours played than reported on my steam page. As you might have guessed, it's my favorite game ever. So this review has been a looooong time coming.As you've already figured out, NEStalgia is truly as if Dragon Warrior was an MORPG, and it does everything right to nail that comparison. If that sounds awesome to you, but the $15 price tag leaves you feeling squeamish, let me assure you, buy the game, man! You're going to love this! There is no other game that takes all of the qualities of beloved 8-bit RPGs and presents them as a MORPG. Skill trees! 8 classes! Gear! Auction House! PvP! For an MORPG, a one-time $15 payment is exceptionally rare. If you're here looking for a great single-player RPG, there are probably better ones than NEStalgia. But the single-player experience is not what this game is about. What makes this game unique and great is the world multiplayer qualities. If you're still thinking about the price, don't forget about that 3-for-the-price-of-2 pack, that's only $10 a person. Or you can wait for a sale that comes around once/twice a year, or ask around for copies that people bought just for the express purpose of supporting the game. personally, I've lost count of how many copies I've accumulated, just because I wanted to help expand the community.I appreciate that this is one of those games that doesn't hold your hand at all. The Mouse boss at the beginning can be accessed, but can't be defeated at the very moment you take the quest. That doesn't mean the game is brutal, you just lose half the gold you happen to be carrying. It's a very early lesson that there is some necessity for caution, that danger exists, and some discretion is the player's responsibility. It keeps you mindful and present in the game, instead of just unconsciously following arrows, checkpoint to checkpoint. Then you go back, beat the mouse's♥♥♥♥♥♥ and feel like you've accomplished something great. The Shade can also be accessed, but not defeated, early in the game. I think that this teaches you that you can't really metagame your way through this, it discourages thoughts like ""I won't encounter something that I couldn't defeat, because this is a game."" It adds a sense of realism. It feels like an adventure. It's the mature philosophy that most MORPGs avoid out of fear of losing players to ragequits. And it's certainly not as if the game constantly bombards you with situations completely out of your control.The world is somewhat small, about on par with most 8-bit RPGs. The play-through time of 30-60 hours is quite standard. After that, there's tons of replayability. You can do daily quests in the Black Sanctum and work your way to the best gear set in the game. If you're 32, you can easily find a veteran willing to carry you almost every day. And even if you can't, there's a 2 or 3 dailies that can be easily solo'd. You can also try out a new class. Each one has a variety of unique, interesting ways to play. Like the soldier! I don't know why everyone rags on him so much lately. He can rip bosses apart with his bleed skills. With counter, he can fulfill his tank duties while still mopping the floor with large groups of trash mobs. Remember to grab those skills that mitigate magic damage - well read, dig deep, shield wall, unstoppable, tenacity, StopSpell, because magic damage will rock your♥♥♥♥♥♥ You might even want to seed up with INT and -ELM seeds. You could also be that Companion Catch'em all Completionist. There's yet more variety to be found leveling new companions. It will be some crazy faraway date before the game's greatest party compositions are sussed out. Totems have an AOE curse ability, making your cleric's Judgment even more insta-killier. Party with fast, lucky pet, like White Wolf, that learns carnage, so your berzerker soldier doesn't have to use a turn applying bleeds before he can enjoy that sweet damage/crit boost. To address some common complaints about the game, there is a lot of truth that the leveling portion of the game is wrought with imbalances and screwy things. Mostly a consequence of major patches that significantly altered the game, but didn't go back in detail to make sure everything scaled elegantly with the changes. You'll definitely notice the megamoths in Balzackia, outputting like 9 times the damage of any other monster you've seen so far, and there is no significant choices for magic defense at that point. But you'll learn to accept that it's just the way things are that some monsters are humongous threats, you'll learn which enemies you need to focus down first, and in a level or two, you'll eat them alive. So unfortunately, more often than not, the answer is grinding. This is a valid criticism. On the other hand, grinding done earlier is grinding that you won't have to do later - the Black Sanctum is not an area that requires grinding to participate. I'm playing on an 8-year old windows XP, and the overworld screen panning is almost perfectly smooth. There is a little stuttering, but after a short while, you get used to it. Besides, it's a turn based game, nothing you do would even slightly benefit from 60fps smoothness. I also barely ever experience server lag. Periods when the game is offline for more than two minutes are also very rare - there is way, waaay, WAAAAY less downtime than World of Warcraft. The initial cosmetic choices are limited. But there are more dyes and masks than you could ask for all over the world and in the auction house to finalize the appearance you want, so there's nothing to worry about when it comes to finding a unique look. It's true that there hasn't been a Colosseum tournament in ages, which I agree is unfortunate. But don't think you're missing out on anything. The Colosseum gear is not better than the Sanctum gear, and you can verify that here: http://nestalgiawiki.com/index.php?title=SetsAlthough the Colosseum set would be easier to get than the Sanctum Set. All the same, you can still be a PvP Pimp by completing your Sanctum set, no Colosseum required. The combat pacing can feel slow, because you can't skip the text. That's why when I'm grinding, I multitask. I watch videos, check email, do homework, etc, in fact I'm grinding phantom dust while I write this review. I'm up to 5, if you're wondering. :P Honestly, I've never really noticed, because I usually need to read the text anyway, and I read at about the pace the text scrolls, but I can see how when you're new, this can feel like it's slowing you down. I think of it as a balancing mechanism for people who read slower, or for people who need to read to know what's happening, which enemies are within killing range, for example. Characters who can just one-shot enemies without needing to know what's going on shouldn't be able to skip text and thus gain a significant speed advantage over other players. On the other hand, this mechanic also slows down characters that use AOE DOTs, because that text takes foooorrreeeevverrrr, so it's certainly something that could be looked at. Companion AI is another valid point of frustration. It would be great if my scorcher, who is specced for engulf, but also knows sear, would use engulf, and then follow up with sear, but there is no way to guarantee he will do that, and therefore that strategy is not viable. Usually, he starts with sear, even though he's specced with engulf! Which is nonsensical, and no adjusting of his tactics will change that. With that noted, you will have no problem getting to Arctic having never used any pet other than red slime and blue slime. It's just frustrating when your pets won't follow through with your epic strategy, and you've worked a pet to max level only to find out that your pet won't behave the way you thought he would.After 1000s of hours, this game is worth $15 to me, no-brainer. I have way more to say, but I'm out of space. Have fun!!!!!!			"

The game is addictive, It is basically pokemon and Final Fantasy had a love child. then Dragon quest squirted on it.Great to play alone, Great to play with friends. Slight balance issues with 1 or 2 classes but nothing that will ruin your gaming experience.On a side note - If you dislike trolls, those who cant take suggestions without backlash, or those who simply find reasons to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the community probably isnt for you, But this game does have single player, and your own servers which you can play with friends, so if you dont want to deal with asshats, you dont have to!

												Fantastic game marred by an abysmal framework (BYOND) and the occasional server issue.  When it's working, though, you'll have lots of fun gathering monster allies and spending skill points to make your 8-bit hero all he can be.  At the moment, however, the claim of being like Dragon Warrior 3 is a little misleading; DW3 was actually a very open-ended game characterized by its exploration-minded questline for six orbs, whereas much of the NEStalgia word seems to have yet to be programmed in.

												A potentially fun game spoiled by a number of factors (including a lack of playerbase, Hope you enjoy only 8-10 people tops during peak hours when you want to party!) And I believe that may be hiding a lack of content through punishing difficulty under the guise of being ""hardcore""I've played plenty of RPGs old and new from console to PC. From JRPG to WRPG- And to compare this to any of them is a disservice to those games.The game isn't hard. The game is unbalanced. You lose half of all any money you are holding if you die- Requiring constant bank trips in order to save up for anything least a mini boss way over your level pops out of nowhere (And I do mean out of nowhere... The second town you can be walkign along or trying to do the catacombs quest and BAM mindflayer with 300 HP at a time you're only able to crank out 30 damage. Who does enough damage to party wipe you in 3-4 turns. Unavoidable RNG and he can appear in THREE DIFFERENT AREAS WHICH ARE YOU REQUIRED TO GO TO TO QUEST!) Havign an easy breezy difficulty curve up to a set point where in you are deadlocked and unable to progress and run entirely out of quests and things to do besides run around the beginner continient and butt your head against the grind wall- And you think, but why do I have to do this?Because past level 15 content is gated behind an immunity gimmick AOE spamming boss who can heal his immunity gimmick AOE helpers that will absolutely demolish you regardless of the arrangement of companions or party members unless you just plain get lucky and all have an inventory full of healing items and use them willy nilly and hope they land on someone who needs it due to the way the turns play out. That is, if the AI doesn't arbitrarily burst damage one of you down before you can make any headway. And even if you do squeak past this? And even if you are so strong you can one shot the previous area's monsters- Now the next area's enemies are mini boss tough by comparison right out of the gate and you will absolutely require a perfect monster companion makeup or party with healing and endurance to make any progress further.A few people or die hard fans might tell me. ""Just get good!"" I am, I did. Just the game itself got worse instead of better. I don't mind a challenge, I do mind when a game is holding me back at every turn for a lack of being able to make a proper challenge or difficulty curve.Or when it's making me waste time because it's afraid of me getting anywhere or finding out there's nothing more to it than a tiny handful of areas disguised and gated by massive grind.

												This game is quite good. Every ounce of retro goodness has been implemented into the game and the effort shows. It almost doesn't even feel right reviewing a game like this. It seems so, ""perfect"". There are those who are kind of on the edge of whether to get this or not though, so a review seems in order. Really the only question that you need to ask yourself is this, ""Do you like retro RPGs?"". If you do not I doubt you would like this, but if, however, you do, I would seriously reccomend it. The game takes some getting used to, but if you give it some time it will reward you greatly. Also, the game is even better with friends, so if you can get a few to join you then you should have a blast! Adding on to this is the promise of free future updates and add ons! So it looks like one will never run out of things to do. A few things need fixing, but I am sure that it isn't anything that will be left unfixed. The game will certainly trigger a feeling of nostalgia, or should I say NEStalgia, that will bring back those childhood gaming memories like no other.			"

												Just briefly getting into the game, I was disappointed. This is not built to be an MMO. A standalone RPG, I could see it, but definitely ill suited for multiplayer. My partner and I purchased it at regular price to get into a game together, and I feel like it was a waste of money. The game just feels too clunky and linear from the get go. The battle mechanics feel awkward, the way grouping functions is just ridiculous for an MMO; you join a group and literally cannot move; you follow whomever started the group. I love the idea of a retro MMO, but good god... take something from the modern gaming world, like independent action or free will of movement.There COULD be a lot to this game, but honestly, after my first impression, I can't be bothered to dedicate any actual time to it. For the price, it did an awful job of making me want to play it.			"

												This game is great fun, and easily addicting. I can confirm that, as I have hundreds of hours on record over the years it has been up (Steam playtime doesn't come close).There's so much depth for what looks like such a simple game, with 8 classes with genuinely different playstyles, dozens of companions (and counting) with very different attributes, a story that is engaging and funny at the same time (which is nowhere near done as of yet), and too many items to name, which is what wikis are for.The community is great and very helpful, like a little family as Marona said, and really gives the game the value it has. It really is a fantastic game, with a friendly and open-to-discussion dev team and competitive and friendly player base. Whether you're fully engaged in boss battles with team mates, or passively grinding while doing something on the side, this game is 142% worth the money and time.			"

												""You'll hit max level in a week then hit a brick wall in content. Your choices will be to grind badges, grind trash mobs in a dungeon or ""grind new characters so you can grind"" all of the above(Admind told me that). Oh there's a colusseum for pvp/items but the devs have not hosted events in years (see below). Also don't expect new content anytime soon, years maybe. Devs are pre-occupied raising children and that's fine. If you started this game when it first opened, the content was way easier up until they patched(Youtube videos of boss battles are dated by years). Content now does not scale with their content patches."" True story.			"

												Saw this game, looked interesting so I watched some video of the gameplay and did the free trial from their website, after that it was a very easy purchase.  Gotta say that it is a really entertaining game.  Spent a little time with the Ninja character and liked it a lot.  Solid throwback mechanics with a nice level of modern MMO complexity layered in.  The music and sound effects are a real plus and do a great job of pushing that nostalgic feeling.  I love the turn-based combat, rare to see executed so well these days.  The core gameplay is spot on and the deep skill trees were interesting. I will be putting some good hours into this, a new fun game to play with friends.  Not sure how it will handle online with other players, but I did a local game and had a blast.   EDIT: Have since played online and the experience is fun, just get some lag hiccups.Anyway, to sum it up - good game, fun gameplay, great music - recommed that you buy it if you have any love for the old turnbased RPGs from the past - some extra touches would really put this over the top.  I can't wait to see the developer continue to polish this title.A few hiccups that I observed: I didn't like that I created a name for my character and the name got truncated on the character select and battle screens, Ninjarius became Ninjariu, a little bit of a letdown. Made me wish I had chosen a shorter name, why allow so many characters if you can't see them all?Also, I am used to tooltip information being a little more accessible in my games.  I think when you select the ability you will use (in the battle screen), I'd like to know what it does - just a short description would be fine.  I had no idea what the ""Essence"" ability did til I took the time to go to the abilities tab and then opened the combat abilities tab and had a read.  This had to be done out of combat, which made a largely straighforward game a little murky.  Make the tool tips a little more comprehensive and/or add an arrow to get a more detailed bit of info about the skills.  It can be a little rough in the beginning when you're getting new skills and you have no idea what they are.Thirdly, I would like to see the party member that takes damage have their portrait flash when they take damage, it is easy to get overwhelmed by the text streams, so that little extra visual cue would help.  Its like how the enemies that get hit get an animation on them as a visual reinforcement.Finally, the game would benefit from mouse movement.  My reasoning is that it feels like the game was meant for a controller but once you start playing it the need for the mouse and keyboard becomes evident and really approprate. Playing it with a controller would be really tough.  Example, clicking and holding would have the character go in that direction, whereas point and click would not be right for this game.  I find myself clicking the screen to move, but it just doesn't work!   I'd like to see an option to move with the mouse as well as the WASD keys.			"

												Updated review:This game is great call back to classic games and adds lot to the genre by adding in multiplayer. Would suggest it for anyone that loved the dragon warrior series but always wished they could play with their friends at the same time.I had issues getting the game to work locally that intially gave me great cause to doubt the games support system thankfully it was an issue from my email providers end not sending messages from the game devs to me. The dev team replied in less than a day just didn't receive it for more than two days later through no fault of theirs or mine.  While the fix would not have worked that the dev team had come up with I did find a fix on my own before finally receiving the email.  Just one word of advice is run everything as admin including Steam even if Steam complains about it.			"

												I've been playing this game for about 5 hours at this point and I must say, it is very fun. If you are a fan of old school RPG's like the final fantasy series then you should give this a try. I haven't played multiplayer yet, but the parts I have played have been fun. This game was a pleasant surprise.That being said, this game is a grind. Some people won't like that, but it's how old school rpg's were. I like a good mindless grind every once in a while. Overall, I like this game. I wish it had better gamepad support though. That would be icing on the cake. I give it a 7/10.			"

												So I played this game from it's Steam release to about a year ago. I'd still love to play it, but University life leaves little time for MORPGs. I'll just get to the point:From a classic RPG view: Decent story, good music and sufficiently lengthy (with an expansion pack coming soon*). I have completed the story solo and had fun doing so. A key mechanic of the game is recruiting the enemies you defeat which each have different strengths and weaknesses which adds a fresh layer of strategy to the classic genre. There are many secrets to discover and not a huge deal of grinding, so if you just want a great single player experience you can do so (though in this case I'd wait for a sale).From an MMO view: The varied classes, equipment and loot (complete with valuable rare items and coveted end-game sets) light up the Diablo-esque fire inside your very soul. The community is small but friendly and on the bigger servers there's always people to chat with and I've never encountered any drama. The replayability of this game is great with shared stashes and companions (some of these guys' hours played... damn) and it comes with a further juicy end-game grind for those sets (limited by daily tasks, but that's okay - it keeps it varied). Finding people to team up with can sometimes take a while but usually there'll be at least one other person willing to party with you. There's also an active marketplace for easy trades.This game can easily be played casually whilst doing something else when you get confident in the game and personally I find it de-stressing after a long day - I played this whilst watching my weeb anime♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'll probably sink another few hundred hours into this after exams. Better than Stardew Valley.			"

												This is a game on a map that is currently unfinished; you are allowed up to 16 characters and currently 8 different character classes. I owned this game before the Steam release (probably another 400-ish hours, maybe even more, it's been so long) and was great. Among the countless hours before and after Steam release was a whole massive ammount of fun, I've met great people and others that are... not so great.... As every other game (either on Steam, or other gaming services), there is always that one person who likes to cause some kind of trouble, this can be avoided if you are on a PvE server instance; on a PvP instance, you would just have to be careful about getting owned outside of a town by another player who wants to kill everyone he sees by force.The game can be a really great experience and also some harsh ones. With at least two classes, you will want to run into bosses to give you an excuse to leave the game, however if you make some buddies that tend to grind through multiple places of the map (each ""region"" is a different difficulty for certain characters, such as a wizard will be better in a ""mage"" - like enviroment where a soldier may have a harder time in that same enviroment) and help you get around easier.This game also offers a set of ""Local"" servers (essentially servers you create(you use your own HDD space for the files and such) and host(if allowed), which you can play with some friends IRL(I recommend a PassWord) and play separately from the community) that you can grant yourself ""administrator"" rights and put certain events on, such as Halloween or Easter. Playing alone has advantages, such as not having to deal with trolls, events that can last an extended time period, and ""speed"" of playing the game. Please Note: the game is in 8-bit which causes a max frame-rate of 20-ish(highest I've seen has been 25).Since the game doesn't require a heavy system(high-end CPU or GPU), you can play this game on almost everything. There are countless hours of fun you can have with this game, along with quite a few that are possibly making you feel like you want to stop playing for some time.The reason I purchased this game on steam was for a secondary account(actually third account) and still have a great time on all the accounts I use. From my knowledge, you do have to create an account with the service BYOND which links that account with your Steam account(via the stand-alone client of the game) which essentially tells BYOND that you bought a game through Steam and have the status of your account to something along the lines of ""Purchaced Game"" or ""Subscribed""All in all, the game can be the best experience of a retro-feel game! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a ""throw-back"" game.			"

												this is a nice game to play on the side, it takes up little power from your cpu, and little bandwidth to play, has a solo server if you just dont feel like watching people give away al the secrets or listening to people go on about this pet and that pet or what have you. every server you play on will generaly recod your progress on that server only. so if you go to server ""midgar"" and have a lvl 30 ninja, that ninja wont apear on server ""YsoLonely"" and neither will the pets.  generaly i play this game when i dont have the full time to tend to a game or i have to stop so often that playing something like kingdom hearts or ultimate fighter becomes imposible to do. the great thing about this game is that you can close it and it will literaly open up Exactly where you left off. in the middle of an attack, in a battle, midst a wall of text. you dont need to repeat anything if your computer decides to suddenly have a heart attack and blue screen you. the people are freindly, there is an auction house but its based off of the 50 or so players that put stuff in there from time to time. the biggest server load ive seen is 71 players on a server so it gets pretty intimate if you play often enough. now a note on leveling. its pretty labor intensive. best to do when you have a movie to watch and can invest time in just going back and forth while killing things. or when your in the middle of an online roleplay or anything that has long periods of waiting that you dont mind  having just a little someothing to keep you occupied on the side. the window for the game can be shrunk manualy and if you happen to die, you get the fabbled slap on the wrist loose half your money and get the boot out of here to go kill some more monsters. rare item drops are legitametly pretty rare.  but if your looking just to have something to do and your feeling silly you can party with someone and they can drive your person around as you attack everythign with them in battle. for those awesome lazy days where you really just dont care to go through the motions of dungeon cawling but want al the exp. you can totaly just link up with someone and let them spend all there time carting you around from battle to battle as you mash your button of death and watch happy gilmore or something like that. i enjoy this game. i mean  you have people in there that are citizens of  BALZACKIA, and the king of BALZACK whose quite the jerk. so you get that little smile on your face and you can say, yess you are the king of the ballzacks. and thees even a quest where you get to insult them, how awesome is that.

												How long have I been looking for this game? A multiplayer turn based RPG? Yes, please. This game is great, with a few minor things. First off, some things I say might get changed or fixed later. (Review written 5/3/14) One thing I didn't like was not being able to see dialouge in a party. The person leading will see it, but not the other two members. Another thing I didn't like was the grinding. Grinding gets boring fast, and you will have to grind at some parts. Other then those two issues, this is a great game. I recommend this game to long time RPG fans as well as newcomers.			"

												I was gifted this game a few days ago, but I can't refund it so I'm giving my friend his 15 dollars back, and at first I was hooked. ""The Old Days"" like most people who see this game. First of all, the name is a predatory tactic for oldschoolers, don't believe the hype.Pros : Nostalgia, interesting classes, different power systems, questing, and interesting mechanicsCons : Some classes are borked, mechanics not utilized well, RNG is ""fun"", railroaded into playing the game a specific way.Started out fun, but you quickly realize skill/grinding doesn't get you far. There are gear and ""party"" checks with the companion system where you need x class with x companions to complete x area or you die. I used the wiki after hitting a wall, I understand how to play, but its not fun anymore. No freedom despite the class choice. So if you are down for an old school experience without the modern day balance, fun, or competence to make and keep a game fun and engaging beyond ""Hey remember the 80s/90s?!"" then buy it!P.S. I play tactical/turn-based games such as X-com, Wakfu, Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Battle tactics, Xenogears, FF7, Suikoden, Front Mission, FF3/6, ULTIMA, etc etc.... Lets just say I have about 10k+ nerd hours of turn-based gaming under my strained, fat belt. ♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												I have always loved this game a lot. If you don't like classic ""retro"" RPGs don't bother though. I think it's worth buying it to take a semi-decent at solo character through to level 32 and see all the game has to offer you in skills, story, locations and their monsters, etc. However I do not recommend it past that first play through. It's more a platform to be social with a few people than an actual game that can keep you busy for hours and hours with a heap of content. You can try other classes if you want, I suppose. The devs don't update it anymore. I'm guessing the max level cap is still 32, even though they had been saying years ago that they were updating it to 40. My prayers are for the people still stuck on this game, going through the motions.			"

												NEStalgia is  a game where John says he opened the one chest that had the vital quest item but in reality he never opened it and we spend an hour wandering around the cave trying to figure out where the crystal is and John is certain that he had opened the chest that had the crystal in it and John is bad.

												Oh I hate that I have to give this a negative review since I loved dragon quest as a kid and this appeals to me, but that massive difficulty spike after the first boss just turned me off forever. And since its a JRPG at heart difficulty is from the enemies suddenly being 5 times as strong and coming in large groups, requiring tons of grinding if I could even make it back to the earlier zone without being ripped apart. Oh well.			"

												I cannot believe how horrible this game is. I bought a three pack for multiplayer but even when you get the game up and running, your friends have nothing to do but select one move per turn in battle. There's another unbelievable, impossiby bad flaw - your party members cannot see the text when you talk to townspeople. They literally sit there and watch nothing while you play the game alone. This game spits in the face of multiplayer. I wouldn't even have played this game when I was a child. Stay away.			"

												A mediocre trip down memory lane, if you are old enough to remember such games.A mediocre waste of time for everyone else however.See, unlike shovel knight which took the charm of 8 and 16bit games while adding an interesting game, NEStalgia used the 8 and 16bit games layer to hide a bland grindfest of a mostly dull game.At first I enjoyed it since it reminded me of RPGs of old and then the grind began. Almost immediately infact.The second quest, ""Kill a mouse"", sounds simple enough but the mouse is the first boss of the game and you need to be around level 6 to beat it. No problem right? Weeeell you need about 600 exp and you gain about 3 a fight with the local slimes outside. Thats about 200 fights, by the way, of doing nothing except pressing 1 to pick attack and then 1 to select your target.The game adds skills and magic but MP doesn't recharge so thats a rest at the inn for you. That will be 3 gold. Not bad except the slimes only drop 2 gold and your first armor can cost as much as 450 gold if you picked warrior.It gets really dull, really quickly and this is only the first town! Theres a whole world out there to explore chump! So mouse is dead, move onto bandits and...I'm dead again. Bandits require you to be about level 9 and that armor you saved up for? Not as useful as you might have hoped now that enemies come in waves of 5 so you guessed it, back to grinding for you.The game isn't all bad, for example you can recruit some of the monsters and they make pretty decent party members and what a good job too because outside of other players, they are the only party members you get! They also don't get to wear equipment so you decide if thats a positive (less gold grinding) or a negative (less overall stats).And finally don't bot. Or appear to be botting at least. If the idea of pressing A,D,1,1 for 50 hours sounds a bit dull for you then I have bad news for you, it is dull. It was dull back then and its dull today. Old NES RPGs had something though, first of all they were all we had unless you owned a PC and second of all while the grind was a way to pad the game out, they normally had a story and events going on that should make you want to play on. Not everything was gated behind a grindfest at every turn, just to pad out the game. Here, grinding is the game and just like being in detention, you are expected to sit and do it and don't complain.When I played, there were no more than 10 people on at ANY given time and while I think the game isn't terrible, I do feel it deserves better than 10 people playing but I can also accept that it probably did have more than 10 people at one time and the refusal to either make the story captivating or to reduce/remove the grind is what lead to the husk we have today.Just as a final note, you can download the game for free outside of Steam although that is probably level capped or something.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

Ehck! This is just.. no. I wouldn't advise purchasing this game.It is doing something very unique, combining your favorable ""NEStalgiac"" RPGs (Dragon Warrior specifically) with the elements of cooperation and community (with even some skill tree elements too. Pretty cool)... but this is nothing far from being a horrid chimera of a game. The most unsightly part I'm adressing is when you move your character; the shifting of the map is so inconsistant and unresponsive. It's such a strange and seemingly-minor bug and I wish I could just ""get used to it,"" but I can't! It's so unfortunate, but it with that said I can only advise to discourage your purchase.			"

Its fantastic to play while talking on Skype because the game allows for indepth coordination due to its layout and organization in battles and as a whole. Its also super easy to join a party, leave a party, assist teammates in and out of battle, and ontop of all of that you can still use your companions while in a group with two friends! SERIOUSLY, BUY THIS GAME. PLAY IT ALONE, PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS... IT DOESN'T MATTER! ITS FUN FOR THE WHOLE FRAMILY! I also love the 8-bit look of the game, gives me a nostalgic feel. The inventory system and companion systems are well made. The party system is phenomenal. The quests are hilarious, what more could one want? BUY BUY BUY FOR THE LOVE OF BALZACKIA, BUY!			"

Some people seem to think ""this is how old games were"" or aren't affected by it, but the jerkiness of the map scrolling behind my character is too much and I physically had to stop playing.

												NEStalgia is an amazing game that perfectly recreates the feel of the old retro RPGs. The story elements are colorful & witty, the combat system is simple on the surface, yet gets much deeper as you progress(in a good way), the recreation of the feel of old games with the 8-bit visuals is beautifully done, and the companion system is a novel and entertaining idea. Just about every creature you fight can be recruited and it's incredibly entertaining. Overall a brilliant game with a wonderful soundtrack, an authentic retro feel, and legitimately FUN gameplay. Great with friends, and almost as fun solo! The skills and abilities are interesting and unique, the player interaction is seamless, and the loot system is fulfilling without taking up too much of the spotlight. Absolutely brilliant!! :D			"

												Pretty cool game. Have been waiting a long time for someone to make a old style turn based Final Fantasy game in a MMO world with PVP. The PVP is a great addition and is one of the major factors why I bought it.Also like how it hasn't gotten bogged down in a massive story. You can jump in and start playing. Also the range of classes is good too.The only things I'd like to see different would be more of a 16bit graphic style with a bit more depth and also for the battle scenes to be more side on than the front on perspective. But these are just personal preferences and it's great someone finally got around to making this kind of game. I think there's a lot of people who have been waiting for a turn based MMO with PVP and considerable depth.			"

												*PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Before you rage, read my comment!*The game itself is not bad. The story seemed like it would have been pretty good, and i liked the NES style. It had a lot of potential for a game. HOWEVER, this game is simply UNPLAYABLE. You heard me, unplayable. As soon as you get into the game, everything seems fine. Nice NES graphics, nice sountrack. Everything is fine. But then you try to move. The engine for this game must be TERRIBLE, because moving is a task.MOVING. Moving should NEVER feel like a chore in a game. Some of you may be wondering what i mean by this. When you try to move, your character stands there and walks in place. The character then teleports 5-10 seconds later, sometimes more. The time it takes to walk is even unpredictable at times. And it's not only with walking. When you click to attack, it does the same thing. 5-10 seconds later(or more), it finally attacks. This makes the process of walking and fighting very tedious. Instead of feeling like i'm in an epic battle, I feel like i'm waiting for the battle to be over. Think of school: you just can't wait for the slow day to be over. That's what this game is. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. Even on a sale, this games wasn't worth it. Until the developers fix this, then I might as well have wasted my money on a 100$ pinball game.			"

												The community is great, and whether you have friends when joining or not, you will make some in this game. The gameplay is amazing and because it has very low graphics, I can even play this on my netbook! The replayability is also very high. The game does feature tournaments and has already been out since 2012 as far as I've heard/seen so it's not something entirely new. It does however have some problems, sometimes I'll freeze(and no I'm not talking about when I play on the netbook).In all I'd give this game a 9/10.			"

												Awful graphics. It looks like an Atari. I don't see how the developers can get away with this laziness in this day and age.			"

												This game is super fun! My only major complaint is it seems like the devlopers don't even update the game anymore. If you're looking for a game with some fun, I'd get it. If you're looking for something that you want to keep playing, don't get it.			"

												cant even play anymore, no custom servers and free users arent allowed to connect to public (and OFFICIAL) servers. NEStalgia randomly disconnected my account from steam and refused to let me generate another CD key. contacted support, ill change this if support ever replies. which it wont.also theres a total of 11 people playing.more than battleborn lol			"
