												A hidden gem, no seriously this is one of the best games I have ever played. The reasons? The minions obviously! They are just hilarious! My favorite part of them is the fact that they can loot equipment so you can have 50 brown fighter minions that look unique and barbaric. Did I mention that they have a hierarchy system too? The strongest minion (and probably your favorite) always goes next to the dark lord and the other line up behind him so at the furthest back you have those newly spawned grunts. You must be careful about the minions that you do care about because if they die they are gone forever. I once had my favorite minion who was wearing a golden crown which he looted from a fat hafling king get smashed by a succubus, oh god did I miss him! I originally got the game on disk hence the play time.			"

												I love Overlord. It is more like a tactical action RPG than a hack-and-slash game. In the first part of the game you will have to heavily rely on your minions in fights, and you can only slowly afford to enter melee as you upgrade your armour and weapon.  And the game makes sure you have to keep some minions around all the time.The graphics are still pretty, with beautiful landscapes, though you can spot some tricks wich were required in 2007 to decently run a game on an average engine by that date. The music was not memorable, but had some catchy accords, the voice acting was done wholeheartedly. The story was not bad, and though it had some great ideas, like incorporating the seven deadly sins, it wasn't the best, either. Linear, but enjoyable.My 33 hours of play include one playthrough with some farming, but dedicated players will want to play it to the end two times: with 0% and with 100% corruption as the goal. This game is well worth every penny.			"

												3rd person, action, adventure, hack and slash RPG. In this game you play as Overlord, and command different kind of imps in battles.Four kinds of imps, with their own strengths and weaknesses. You are very vulnerable without your army of imps, though you can do decent amount of damage. Game has plenty rich and colorful environments, with many missions available. Story is basic and linear with good/bad choices you can make on the way, that will shape your Overlord to look more badasss if you go evil.You have your own Tower ""base"", which you can pimp out, by buying statues, banners, room accessories, etc. At some point in game you'll even get your very own Mistress, with some more darker and voluptuous surprise ahead.Game has decent visuals and good texture quality for 2007. Voice acting is good, animations are basic, unit control can sometimes be wonky. Game has some funny moments and humor here and there, and generally is great and fun experience.			"

												I played Overlord back when it first came out, and remembered enjoying it quite a bit. I was excited to see it on sale here on Steam with its addon and sequel, so I picked them up dirt cheap.The game is pretty fun, with the story being staged with you in the role of the villain out to subjugate any and all you come in contact with. You get the option to choose between good and evil, but it's more accurately evil and really, really evil. The game play is fun, though a bit frustrating when you can't quite find how to get to the next area. I realized how much I've come to rely on the objective markers in newer games (Skyrim and such), when I had to actually think about where to go. Once you get all four minion types, the game really starts to move, because more paths to success are open to you.The primary negative to the game, I feel, is the minion control when using the keyboard and mouse. Controlling minions is often clunky, especially if you are standing just a bit too close to something you want them to interact with. It is exceedingly difficult to control the minions when they have to lure enemies to certain places or take timed explosives to certain points before they detonate (both happen a lot late in the game). It was really hard to move around while directing a minion, which made a couple of challenges lose their entertainment value quickly.Besides those few specific examples, however, I found the game to quite fun all these years after my first playthrough. The graphics are dated, and the story is very shallow, but it was worth the couple of bucks I spent on it. Just remember you are playing an older game when you start!Edit: It was mentioned in comments that I might need to note that my hours recorded playing are inaccurate. I have a tendancy to leave games running overnight while I'm sleeping or while I'm at work, so the hours logged never match my actual hours played by a long shot. Do NOT expect to get over 300 hours of playability out of this game. I have no idea exactly how many hours I've put in.			"

												Overlord is one of the games that sticks in your memory for all reason you can never quite remember until you play it again. It’s charming nature and settings, the witty writing and character behaviours really set it apart from anything else upon its release and offered something really new without taking it’s self seriously.

												This game was initially released in June of 2007. Although dated, Overlord provides an alternative take on the fantasy genre. Instead of being a hero out to save the world, you start out as an evil lord who needs to rebuild his tower that was previously ransacked by heroes in the past. Throughout the course of the game, you are provided a handful of moral choices that will either raise or lower your evilness also known as ""corruption"". The higher your corruption, the more evil you will look. Don't take the game too seriously though as it has a quirky, satirical humor to it.The gameplay is very basic. Controlling the Overlord is as simple as moving and pressing the attack button repeatedly. The complexity is in controlling your minions. There are four types of minions based on color that you recruit into your army: fighters, mages, assassins, and healers. As long as you're willing to collect enough life-force, your minions will have an infinite number of lives and you can spam them carelessly against each enemy to beat the game. To add a little more difficulty, you can employ tactics to beat the game with the least number of minion casualties. This will help reduce the grind for life-force, which is also used in upgrading your equipment so using tactics will help you become stronger much faster.Once you have fully upgraded your weapons and armor with Arcanium and their life-force upgrades, the difficulty of the game becomes laughably easy. You can literally kill everything in your path without even using your minions at all.The game does have a couple of issues. The audio and voice-acting is fairly bad. There are some characters that you will come across that will make you want to turn off your speakers when they talk. Not a huge deal if you play with subtitles. Gameplay can get very repetitive about halfway through the game. Controlling the minions can also become frustrating, especially when navigating complex routes. Sometimes they just don't go where you want them to or they just do what they want to do. It definitely fits the description of a ""chaotic"" army.The most glaring issue is the lack of any kind of map. You will need to either memorize your way around, which isn't too difficult, or wander aimlessly until you find what you are looking for.Overlord has a Steam sale just about every other month. This is an unbeatable value for only a couple of dollars.			"

NOTE:Also see my:Overlord: Raising Hell Review TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Overlord is a third-person action/adventure game developed by Triumph Studios and published by Codemasters. The game's primary selling point is the fact that it is parody of generic fantasy themed worlds. The game also heavily relies on its primary game feature called 'Minion Control' where the player does 20% of the work while the other 80% is done by small goblin/gremlin/imp like creatures collectively called 'Minions'.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game puts the player in the horned helm of a recently resurrected warrior whose name is never mentioned but is generally known to everyone as “The Overlord.” Having been recently revived, he is informed by an old minion named Gnarl that a group of adventurers killed the old Overlord, ransacked the Overlord's Tower and 'freed' the previously controlled domain of his predecessor. As the new Overlord, the player is now tasked to take back the lost territories and exact revenge on the unsuspecting 'heroes'.PROS:+ The graphics, although aged, still looks good. The art style is reminiscent of Fable 1 which was nice for its time;+ Interesting new concept of minion control which was more or less implemented well;+ Great minion control mechanic despite some minor annoyances;+ Dark humor with obvious parodies and easter-eggs;+ Good weapon and armor design but...(See CON #1);+ Good story with a good plot twist;+ Nice voice acting (that goes well with the humor) and sound effects;+ Good level design with a lot of environment variation;+ Fun little mini-games and puzzles; and+ Healthy game time.CONS:- Limited selection of weapons and armor;- Cutscene animations needs improvement;- No Overlord's Tower defense quest (I expected that adventurers would attack my tower and I would have to setup defenses but no such event happened);- The Overlord's Tower has little to offer aside from the Dungeon and the Forge: Most of the tower upgrades are cosmetic with no bearing on character progression;- Can't talk to the NPCs outside of quests and stories: Disappointing specially if you want to know more about them or want to ask questions;- Limited corruption events / triggers;- Can't do much in terms of exploration; and- Fixed camera that sometimes bug out when sweeping minions.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes highly RECOMMENDED. Overlord may not be a Triple-A title but it certainly delivers a fun and enjoyable experience with its interesting game mechanic, good story backed up by good level design, good humor and an overall wonderful experience. WORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game at FULL price because its relatively cheap.FINAL NOTE: If you're interested in purchasing the game, consider the THE OVERLORD COMPLETE PACK which contains Overlord 1, Overlord: Raising Hell (expansion), and Overlord 2. If, for some reason, you don't want Overlord 2 then purchase both Overlord 1 and Overlord: Raising Hell because the expansion does add a substantial chuck of story to the main title and serves as a prologue to the events of Overlord 2.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												A good console game, similar to Pikmin and Little King's Story.The game benefits from a very devilish kind of humour, a pretty soundtrack and an amazing art direction. The landscapes look fantastic and the characters are very well designed.You get to play as the evil Sauron (pre-eye transformation), and control a whole bunch of cutesy gremlins to do your evil bidding. It's always a joy to interact with your minions, ordering them to pillage, kill, steal, or to even (accidentally) commit suicide!Unfortunately, the controls are a little unresponsive at times, the levels are very linear with too many backtracks, and the gameplay gets a little bit monotonous after a while. There's a little bit of grinding involved as well, if you want to craft better stuff (and you probably should). The online multiplayer mode is pretty much dead.Despite its many flaws, it's still a fun game. Drowning your first minion will probably become your most memorable and funniest moment in your whole gaming history.			"

												Sometimes a game's like a hamburger with weird ""secret sauce"" you get from a small burger joint. It needs a lot of polish (or ketchup, you know) for you to say that it's amazing, but you still really end up liking it. That's basically Overlord.Overlord is essentially the result of Pikmin, the original Fable, and Sauron being thrown into a blender. It has gameplay elements of the first, the charm of (and clear inspiration from) the second, and you take on the role of the third.The gameplay is pretty good, for the most part, but it definitely needs some refinements here and there. You're the titular overlord, and you have an army of minions at your disposal. These little guys serve a range of different purposes, ranging from basic cannon fodder to being needed for progression in certain areas. They have their own classes, and each class is separated by their color. Browns are brutes, greens are assassins, reds are fire mages which act like archers, and blues are mages that can revive your dead troops.The Overlord himself initially needs these minions in combat for survival, with strategic minion usage in the early hours of the game being the difference between life and death. Later on he's able to do alright in combat on his own, but that doesn't make combat as the Overlord very fun. Melee combat has laughably poor animations, and just feels awful. Magic combat is a bit more fun to use, but quickly drains mana at higher ranks. There are some neat details, though, like fire magic burning fields. You can unlock different spells (and different ranks of spells) by finding different totems throughout the world.There's plenty of totems throughout the world, and finding them is pretty satisfying. You'll often want to revisit previous areas after gaining new minion types to look around for totems, as some of them are the only way to boost your health, mana, and maximum minion count.Actual level design is fine... for the most part. There's a point (fairly early on in the game) where you're going to need to get through the first couple segments of both areas available to you at the time to get the minion types needed to clear both, and it isn't obvious at first. Combine that with the fact these areas are fairly annoying to beign with, and you have a negative stretch close to the start of an otherwise good game.The story is also an enjoyable romp, even if the game seems light on it. There's a lot of hints dropped throughout the game about its finale, leading up to a story heavy ending. The finale's good enough that I'd recommend not spoiling it, but it's not like the game will be ruined if you know what it is or anything. There's multiple routes, too, which allows you to end up with a pretty happy ending. You could also be a murderous maniac, if that's your thing.Overlord in general needs a lot of polish, as previously mentioned. Combat is unsatisfying, there's really annoying levels at the start of the game, and the boss fights are annoying because of how bad the combat is. It's a game that could be a lot better than it is, but I still really do enjoy it. It has a ton of charm, has decent length, and still kept my interest for almost all of its 20 hour length.TL;DR/Wrap-up: It's $5 for a good (albeit flawed) game that should take you 20 hours to go through. On a buy/sale/don't buy scale, this is a definite buy.			"

												After 20 hours i managed to finished the game.Let's start with the most important.I suggest that game for the lovers of RPG games but it's also a good strategic game where you can command a mini-army of minions,little monsters ready to follow your orders.In the game are present 4 types of minions.Brown Minions - The best minions for fighting,they got the highest health,armor and damage,but beside that,nothing special.Red Minions - Ranged Minions wich attacks by throwing fireballs to the enemies,they got extremly low health and armor,and alone they are kinda weak,they are very good in groups,by attacking enemies while the brown minions defend them,they are also fire-resistant and can absorb fire from certain paths to leave you proceed.Green Minions - Close combat minions,low attack but extremly deadly in backstabs,they can also turn invisible and are poison resistant,allowing them to destroy noxious-plants. Great for ambushes and traps.Blue Minions - They are literally the worse for combat,they got extremly low health,armor and attack.The good side is the fact that they can actually swim in the water without drowning,that may allow them to follow you trough rivers and swamps,they also got some magical powers,wich allow them to resurrect dead minions,and they are the only kind of character wich can actually hurt magical beings like ghosts or whisps.You can control an army of minions by spawning them from magical-holes linked to your tower,to spawn minions you will need certain lifeforce that can be gained by killing enemies (For example,if you will kill sheeps you can gain brown lifeforce,wich you need for spawning brown minions,and if you are going to kill fire bugs you gain red lifeforce,to spawn red minions) You can stock as many lifeforce you want but you have a limit by the minions that can follow you,you can increase the limit by collecting objects,by myself,i reached 35 max minions.Minions can also collect stuff from the ground like weapons,axes,piece of armors,helmets to increase their power and attack but they will also collect useless stuff like broken pumpinks.The minions will always give you the lifeforce they harvest and the gold they found by pillaging,we need to mention that the main character is extremly weak and you will almost-always need your minions.Good/Bad sides+Interesting Story full of surprises+You may choose certain paths trough the story to determine if you are going to be an Evil Hero or an Evil Evil (that's shown by your corruption level wich increases for each innocent creature killed or with each extremly evil thing you do)+Detailed Minions +Original concept +Funny story and lots of funny scenes+You got your own mistress OwO and a jester (I named him box-sack)- The character never talks (All you can hear are some grunts from the helmet from time to time when you swing your weapon)-Linear levels (Even if you may choose to take some paths,you have to follow linear levels,wich imposes you to go trough certain areas and complete certain quests)-Extremly poor character customization (You can forge new helmets,weapons and armor by sacrificing your minions into a smelter,but there are only 3 types of weapon,1 helmet,1 armor and 3 materials for each one of those)-Main Character fight system extremly poor (All you can do are 12 spells,and swing your weapon,without making any other types of attacks,you just swing your weapon in front of you and deal some damage,nothing more)Now that i finished Overlord i'm going straight and definitely to play Overlord 2. Buy that game,you won't regret it.			"

												I've always been a big fan of this game, hoping sometime there would be another sequel, but it seems the idea was dropped. To give you an idea of how much I adore this game, I've played through it about four times by this point.There's always question about which Overlord you should pick up if any, the first or the second? Personally, I say both. Here I will just review the first one though.A fantastic singleplayer RPG with clever humor, good boss fights, enticing story and an interesting combat system that I can't say I've seen in any other game.You are the Overlord. Your job is to restore your tower to its former glory, convince the lowly townsfolk that you are indeed the Overlord and to wreak havoc with your minions (although sometimes you might decide to be nice to the citizens of your domain to make them praise you rather than fear you)But what is an Overlord without his minions? There are four types of minions, which you unlock over time, but pretty early in the game you have all four. The first type is your default melee minions that just love to get in trouble and start fights, the second is a ranged type that are terrible in melee but can put out fires and throw fireballs, the third is a sneakier kind that can be used with clever positioning to take out key targets rapidly, but they suffer in direct confrontation, and the fourth is a healer that can resurrect your fallen minions for a while before their corpses decay (They can also swim, unlike all your other minions)The overlord himself of course also has combat potential. He can hit people with his melee weapon of choice and cast spells that he has unlocked, there are plenty of spells ranging from direct damage (throwing fire at all your enemies and watching them burn to death while laughing horrifically) to buffing your minions (and watching them claw your enemies apart in a maddened frenzy before they start tearing each other apart)There's also a crafting system that lets you craft weapons and armour with special stat bonuses given by letting your minions throw themselves into the flames to enhance your equipment.This is definitely one of the most overlooked games that I know of, and that couldn't be a more undeserving title to have.

												The game which I come back to again and again.I have to say that this piece of unpolished code is by far one of my favourite games. The humor, the playstyle, the choice between a Rigthous and an Evil lord - yours for the picking.The game's charm and fun gameplay would entangle anyone. Having to control minions is quite intuitive and makes quite the scene when you control 50 of them.Build your Tower, build your army and marry a mistress. But all in all - take a break once in a while from all the fun you will be having with this title, it can get out of hand.			"

												In Overlord, you take the role of the epinonymous anti-hero, recently resurrected by your hysterical minions to take up the mantel of your fallen predecessor. Very little backstory is provided and this is a little disappointing, but the humorous sequence through which your minions great you makes up for it. Apparently a band of nefarious do-gooders trashed your Evil Tower, and you've got to put it back together, strange the peasants into submission and get your revenge.To do this, you are teleported into the first map area to pummel some bloated halflings (I never did like hobbits). The first map (and the ones that follow) is well designed and beautiful, with some creative ideas to keep it interesting and give you an open feel. You're welcome to explore at your leisure but, to accomplish your quests, things move in a fairly linear fashion. To the game's credit, however, it doesn't FEEL linear. I felt free to do what I wanted when I wanted to do it. But, tasks really must be completed in a certain order before you can progress. (Un)-fortunately, that precise order isn't clear until after some trial and error (which either leads to confusion or creates that non-linear sensation).The primary tool in your conquest will be your minions. Your selection is limited but effective. You have your warriors (brown minions), fire throwers (red minions), assassins (green minions) and healers (blue minions). Ironically, your minions are the real star of this game -- not you. They run around, wreaking havoc on the land and indulging your every whim. They leap onto the backs of sheep and ride them like broncos and swarm over your enemies like a bunch of gibbering goblins. Constantly breaking loose funny little jokes and reverently presenting you with treasure and gifts, they really steal the show and I never get tired of them. Compared to thim, the Overlord is definitely the strong silent type -- individually he is far more powerful in battle, but your minions are far more powerful when used en masse.Your evil-ness is rated on a scale of corruption. You can take the less ""evil"" path by helping your peasants and restoring the Elven race or you can be Evil by pillaging the village, killing the peasants until they're suppressed, and slaughtering the few remaining elves like the simpering fools they are. Reflecting your chosen path is a selection of two mistresses (a fiesty but well-intentioned maiden or a sultry and wicked seductress).I found the gameplay relatively simple and not terribly challenging. I doubt it's supposed to be. The game is, first and foremost, about having fun. The game is riddled with little jokes and the minions have kept me chuckling and laughing the whole time.The graphics are rich and beautiful, and the sound is also well done but not particularly remarkable. The real gem is the gameplay and the novelty of being Evil. Due to the linear nature of the quests, I'm not sure what the replay value of this game will be, but it is a fun and enjoyable romp.			"

Imps and goblins usually annoy me - like the sidekick in The Darkness II - but these little fellows manage to be endearing.Anyway, this game has its tongue firmly pressed to its cheek, in a good way.It parodies LOTR - except you are playing as pseudo-Sauron, sweeping your minions across halfling villages and elven forests with an evil grin on your face.You (the Overlord) are slow and lumbering, but your minions - whom you can guide with an invisible hand or more precisely assign tasks to - are fast and fluid.It's sort of open world - open enough to let you revisit previous (respawning) locations to replenish your gold and Souls.Negatives: Lots of backtracking. No way to sprint or speed up your Overlord character. And no mini-map of any kind. These three problems are a big no-no in an open world game.			"

												So I saw this on a pretty decent sale price for the bundle. Looked cute if nothing else, and in a fun anti hero kind of way. After an hour of play I had to get a second copy of the bundle for my daughter to play along.  It is not the game to replace games for RP. It is however fun, and humorous. A lot of goofy fun to be into things going on, and a lot of kill time potential. If your looking for massive carnage and destruction, delivered without a high degree of graphic realism, its perfect. IE it's great fun destroying the fields of sheep, sending minions to rampage in the dungeons and destroy the Halflings and Elves.. and occasionally torment the meager Humans... without any feeling of Postal or GTA type play. Depending on how you set standards it is kid friendly level. ( Not talking kids who play Barbie dreamhouse or Unicorn Flower Magic ) But excessive blood / gore / visual is not there. There are some innuendo type things later in, but no more than you find in Spongebob or Disney films these days.  Its been running great on WIN 10 and on a lappie WIN 10. I ve not encountered any of the bugs I had read about. The minions voices are perfect. The things they say, and the way they each select different looks / weapons is hilarious.Completely worth it for a fun time game.			"

												its not a classic but feels like it should be. pretty much a more ""evil"" version of pikmin.-graphics : its a 2009 game, so dont expect too much. though its all cartoony and makes you feel like playing an old ps1 game, like crash bandicoot or something.-story is quite interesting and the game seems to have established their own world, which is cool.- soundtrack is okay, i personally like the overlord theme, but if you spend too much in one area it gets pretty old fast. but the voicing in this game is top notch, especially for gnarl. the dialogue is pretty funny and entertaining.- now the gameplay, is as i said , like pikmin, you get to control your horde of minions. its alright most of the time but your minions are such dumbasses that you gotta watchout not to get too many of them killed. at first getting souls is pretty hard but it gets pretty easy when you start crafting the later armors. most of the enemies need a bit of dodging here and there, so getting all your horde to attack an enemy too long might be too dangerous since he can counter attack after getting swarmed for a while. they attempt to put in a choice system, despite not really doing much to the story except a few scenes, mostly just affect your castle/appearance so i wouldnt say the replayabilty is there.i gotta say that some of the maps are pretty boring too and sometimes you just want to rush some areas. the overlord walks kinda slow too which makes me want a sprint button, not to mention the game promotes backtracking.  the boss isnt exactly the grandest fight out there , since mostly just need to get your minions to gangbang the hell out of them.but the overall level design ,puzzle and gameplay is quite fun despite the drawbacks i just mentioned.the direct control over minion is a bit clunky and should be fixed in a way, perhaps make it so you can move it using directional keys instead of using a mouse.pretty good, had quite some fun and cant wait to play the 2nd game plus hyping for the 3rd game.

												Take 2 parts Pikmin, 1 part Lord of the Ring and a dash of humor.  Shake and serve cold. Overlord is a unique game.  You play ""The Overlord"" a dark and mysterious figure served by ""minions"".  Not the yellow twinkie shaped minions from Despicable me, but impish shaped creatures.   The player gets the ability to chose what type of overlord will he be, either good or evil, and that's really the weirdest part of the game. It's not that morality systems are necessarily bad, it's just that the ""Overlord"" in this game usually has the option to be benevolent or evil, and even when he's evil, it's quite tame.   The sequel will eventually figure this problem out with ""Dominate or Destroy"" morality choices.   However for this game, the choice is usually something like ""do you give the food to the villagers or keep it for yourself. The problem with this morality is neither is really that interesting.  Keeping the food doesn't give a noticeable difference other than less farming to do, which would be useful but by the end of the game, you can easily gather hundreds of minions with minimal work, and the game isn't hard enough that being selfish sounds good. There is one morality choice that offers you to choose between two mistresses for your castle, and that's about the only choice that really matters because it decides what minions to power up.  The ""good"" choice though outweighs the bad choice.  Who knew being evil was so hard? The point of this diversion though is that while the Overlord idea is ""you are the villain"".  In actual gameplay.  You're not really, and that's kind of the flaw of this game.  You're never as evil as you could be.  Yes you can be eviler than a ""hero"" but overall it's a pretty milquetoast version of evil. However with that being said, the game is actually quite good.  In 2001 Pikman came out and was a fantastic adventure game, and then took forever with sequels, apparently the creator of this game saw this market barely being serviced and stepped up to fulfill the need, and to be honest they did.  Overlord plays like Pikman though better, and with no time limits, solving the big complaint about Pikman. The player is able to summon four types of minions each with different strengths, and using the minion in various ways he has to make his way through levels.  The minions can be controlled in a few different ways, from sweeping the minions left and right, to tasking the minions directly.  The minions are smart enough that placing them in a location they'll intelligently fight with enemies, or when sweeped around an interactable item, they'll figure out what to do (with a few exception, but exceptions for the right reason). The Overlord himself is quite weak, but over time (and forging) will gain a great amount of power to the point that he'll eventually be able to stand up to enemies almost solo by the end of the game.   In fact the weak form at the beginning of the game feels very different from the end of the game where the player feels like he doesn't need the minions as much (though of course he does) As for the story, it starts off feeling like a rip off of Lord of the Rings,  with the character clearly being influenced by Sauron, the first town being named ""Spree"" and the first enemies are halflings.  There's other clear Lord of the Ring mythology lifts (Elves and dwarves of course).  but after Spree the game seems to diverge from Lord of the Ring and finds it's own fantasy story, and does well with it, though borrowing heavily from other mythos.The thing is though, the game works in all the right ways.  There's never an extremely annoying part of the game, and the game lasts at least 15 hours, probably closer to 18.  While there's some padding to this number due to the length of dungeons, you're never in the same environment for very long.  There's a decent amount of exploration, and a few alternate paths that give different result.  Players will likely need a guide at some point due to a weak quest system which doesn't tell the player exactly where things are, but at the same time, it's not a horrible system and only once did I miss a major area.   Still this is 2007, so a lot of the handholding that modern games do is missing.   That's not necessarily a bad thing, but can make this game frustrating if you find yourself in that position.Overall though, this is a game which barely got noticed when it first came out, and probably deserved a bigger audience.  I really liked Overlord, and the fact I put 20 hours or more into it speaks to that.   If you like Pikman, like quasi ""evil"" or just like to play something a little different, I would recommend Overlord.			"

												A game where you choose to spare lives or conquer all.Any side you choose will end up as the same amount of fun. A strategy game that DEFINITELY deserves more attention than it does now, even though it's made in 2007.Gameplay = Arguably amazing.Graphics = Not bad. C'mon, it was made in 2007. Give 'em a break.Lore = Confusing at first, amazing second.Only thing bad I really see is a few minor glitches whereas your minions get stuck in walls and you're unable to retrieve them into your horde. It's simple to retrieve them. You just have to quickly travel to a different destination and back. I would HIGHLY recommend this game. 9.5/10			"

												OverlordLet’s get this out of the way: Overlord is a blast to play, sure time has taken it’s toll on the game but the charm still remains intact. In Overlord, you play as an evil guy who has to pillage various villages and take back his lordship with the help of his mighty powers and the cute but loyal minions. The story in Overlord is a just a way to give way to chaos. The main meat of the game comes from the evil things that you do. Overlord has garnered a cult following in the timespan it has been released and with good measure. It is a game where you truly feel like you have been granted the powers and you are the best the demons have to offer.The gameplay of Overlord is fairly simple. You can either attack yourself or send your minions to plunder the wealth of innocents. There is no better joy than to seeing your minion bring back coins and just drop it at your feet. You can have a limited amount of minions jogging around at a time. You can respawn them for a price once they’ve fallen into a battle. They are pretty easy to spawn again and again which makes for a enjoyable play. You don’t have to worry about minions dying in battle because of this reason. Now, that’s not to say that you yourself are underpowered. No, not at all. In fact, as you move up in levels, you get far too much overpowered for anyone to stop you. At that point, you don’t even need to use your minions as the work is pretty much done by your much more quickly and efficiently, The Sound design in Overlord is pretty good. Minions have the usual chirpy, jittery kind of voice which gives you a sense that they want to keep plundering around with you. When villagers run and scream, it brings a gleeful smile on your face. The music is spot on here.Since the game was released more than 9 years ago, the visuals look pretty dated. But along with games like Bully, Overlord holds up pretty well. Nothing will surprise you, but there is enough detail in the environments which will keep you coming back should you enjoy the gameplay.Overall, Overlord is a game that is worth buying simply because you get to experience the evil side of a story. Also, the minions. Don’t let the old release date fool you, this is a treasure waiting to be plundered.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

The good don't know how close to evil they really areShort Answer: Great gameOverlord is a Fable turned RTS/Action Game taking place in the same medieval setting. You play as The Overlord accompanied by 4 different types of minions in an effort to be recognized as the new overlord of the realm.You personally control the overlord, swinging your weapon or casting spells but also are in charge of using your minions appropriotely. It creates an interesting mix of action and RTS to accomplish combat-like puzzle elements throughout the game. While punishing at times, the game offers a unique playstyle not seen before.Your varying minions will be used strategically to accomplish puzzles. Brown minions are effective at combat, red minions throw ranged fireballs and can remove fire obstacles, green minions can hide and jump on enemies but also remove gas obstacles and blue minions ... can swim ... but mostly die (they can also ressurect if you're quick enough).You're also forced to make choices throughout the game to increase or decrease your corruption level which determine the flow of your game. Save the town or let it burn?Pros: Unique gameplay Fun dialogue, great characters Interesting bosses and fight mechanicsNeutral: No map, no quest markers. You have to learn your surroundings.  Dated graphics. Game was made in 2007.Cons: Not much plot to keep you around. There is a plot, but you follow this blind notion to 'Be The Overlord' and do many quests, but theres not much deep central meaning to any of it until more than halfway through the game. Minions get stuck, and sometimes don't know they can't swim. Small bugs, but not destructive. "

												Fun game, with a different proposal from the usual. It's an action RPG that the focus is on controlling minions to perform much of the dirty work while you just give support. It is not a game to be taken seriously, with a hilarious storyline in which you are the incarnation of evil, but you have to choose if you are completely bad, or just a little, and will define the end of your game.The gameplay is simple, control your minions and develop strategies to overcome challenges and enemies, the beginning of the game is not exciting and gives the impression that it will be repetitive and boring. But by the time you will acquire new types of minions with different characteristics to be used together, and you can upgrade your equipment (weapons and armor), which makes the game more fun and challenging. The graphics and animations are poor, as well as the sounds. But as a whole the game is polished and well done.The most negative points for me are the controls, which are sometimes complicated to get used, mainly controlling the minions. Did not like the UI too, I missed a map or mini-map. Despite this, I would recommend.7/10			"

												I played this game when it came out and really enjoyed even though i didn't finish the last missions.I few years ago i bought myself the Overlord games available on PC to enjoy the series in it's complete form.Best parts of the game aside from the story are the minions who have funny comments in most situations and a lot of silly animations which is a must have part because a badass Overlord never talks. He just points at stuffs he wants the minions to do something with and they tnderstand it most of the times. When the Overlord points at mushrooms they know it's going to be a war between them and the fungi. Overlord is a bit like a feudal lord. You can kill your subjects in your domain and they will still ask for your help.The game is well made and deserves the attention.			"

												Overlord Review.Intro, Overlord is a cult classic original series created by Codemaster's in 2007. Its a very unique game where you control a 3rd person overlord then command an army of minions kind of like an RTS.    Pros 1  The game is a personal favorite of mine a one of a kind game that has one of a kind gameplay. The only other game that is like this is overlord 2 and if you ask me the first was far better than the second. I just have never played a game like this wanting to make an army and gearing them up for tough battles. The game also has a legendary difficulty that I have not managed to beat yet. 2 The game has amazing sound, I don't think most people have tried the 3D audio, surround sound of the game but it sounds amazing. The game has wonderful conveyance, so its difficult puzzle filled nature isn't such a pain to figure out when you have gnarl a well written character by the way, give you instructions and advice often. The games story is wonderful interesting and fresh, after all how many stories do you get to play as the villain in a game? If you have bought a new soundcard, speakers or something like that and you want a game to take full advantage of that overlord will sound great and you will be able to hear the environment. 3 The game is full of content, replay value and puzzles and has many different game modes. The game even has split screen multiplayer, lan and used to have online multiplayer. The split screen gameplay is lots of fun with a friends and the single player content is multiple hours worth as it will take time collection all the missing tower objects and finishing all the worlds and many levels. Cons 1  The game has no mods, for being on PC for so long and for being such a classic and original game it is shocking that there are no huge mods to the game if it had official support or not. This may be a minor issue but I have bought the game more than once, and I was hoping to mod the game but nobody has made any mods for the game.2  If you don't like puzzles the game isn't full of it as much as a puzzle game but it will constantly challenge your mind as you need to figure out how to do things, how to use your minions, what tactics and formations to use and how you will build your overlord. The game is also a huge pain when you spend a long time gearing up your minions only to have then all or almost all of them die in one attack that you didn't see coming. The game isn't the most casual and relaxing game because after all there is evil to be done. 3 the online multiplayer is 100% dead. It was not a huge part of the game, I never played the game online myself but I did play it locally and it was quite fun so it will be missed a little but to be honest the multiplayer is not that great it fun to play a few times but it loses its charm quite fast. To Conclude overlord is a unique one of a kind classic with great sound, full of content and has good conveyance. While the multiplayer is dead, there are no mods unfortunately, and the puzzles and tactics filled nature of the game is not very easy to get into its still an excellent game that I would recommend to anyone wanting a new game. The game even has controller support. I have played the PC vanilla version on disk, then I have played the console xbox port with the raising hell DLC and I have played the steam port with all the DLC legendary difficulty, that costs money on the xbox port.  Do I recommend you buy this game? To put it bluntly, Yes for 19.99$ the game is worth it and for, 5.49$ the game is well worth it. I would recommend you get the raising hell DLC and see my review on that.  (note: my hours spent playing the game are not shown because raising hell the expansion is the new launcher and my game time is shown on the DLC)  "

												You are the Dark Lord Sauron Overlord and you have Gollum minions that kill and wreck everything on your command while saying things like ""Yes master"". You travel to the village of Bree Spree and rid it of the nasty little Hobbits ""Halflings"". After this you will travel more and more to gain more power.8/10 would Lord of the Rings again			"

												A pretty enjoyable action game where you command a bunch of goblins in order to cause chaos everywhere around. Decent humour, although dialogues are sometimes too cringeworthy and dumb. The gameplay itself is fun though. Audiovisuals are nice, story is terrible, gameplay doesn't prove any challenge, but it's fun nonetheless. I recommend getting it on a sale.			"

												A little-known title and especially little acclaimed by critics.This game has its problems, technically.. it has really a lot of problems, bugs, slow animations and glitches.Sometimes it's tedious and harrowing, but this game has an incredible potential and it's able to use it all.This game succeeded to make me feel a lot of different feelings thanks of a lot of different elements that make this game very unique and that I'm going to write here below:-the gameplay, an union between Pikmin and Dungeon Keeper it's simply genial and an excellent idea was to give a set of spells and a rpg stats system to the main character. The forge furthermore, It's able to increase the longevity of the title with a little farming sessions.-The plot, initially I had not noticed that this game had a substantial plot, I noticed it at mid-game and this helps me to enjoy more this title. seriously it's not so big, but the story of this game it's very worth. WHEN YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN ROSE AND VELVET AND BREAK THE VAJAJA OF ONE OF THEM!! FANTASTIC!-and the soundtrack that blends perfectly with the atmosphere even if it'd contrast the game main theme.This game is a little masterpiece, buy it!			"

												If you’ve ever wanted to have an army of loyal goblin minions willing to do almost anything to serve your evil needs, then Overlord is the game for you. The game stars you, the Overlord, whom has recently been brought back from the dead by a mysterious creature looking for a new master to spread evil across the land.The game pushes you out into the village of Spree where you are tasked with summoning various minions to harvest souls from living creatures (such as sheep or monsters) which serve as a sort of currency for summoning additional minions or upgrading weapons and armor. Minions come in 4 different flavors: brown, red, blue, and green, and each of these has their own special strengths and weaknesses. Though you start with brown, you will need to venture to various locales and dungeons to unlock the other 3 variants. Minions are basically your “army” and are needed in order to fight the majority of the enemies you encounter as you play. Minions can also be sent to areas that are inaccessible due to narrow passages and they will be more than eager to flip remote switches and carry heavy objects back to your castle via the various warp gates scattered across the land. There is also an array of magic spells to assist your minions, protect yourself, or do heavy damage to single targets.Another factor in the game is your “corruption” level which grows as you do extremely evil deeds (murdering innocent civilians, choosing gold over saving lives, etc) although it seems that the only purpose for this metric is aesthetic, meaning your armor and castle are just more spikey and evil looking. Speaking of your castle, you can upgrade various parts of it to your liking but these upgrades are also mostly just for cosmetic appeal.The game’s learning curve is a bit on the easy side, and I found myself clearing many areas simply by having a large number of minions and holding down the “send minions” button while waggling my view around until they had killed/looted/activated everything in the general area. Fortunately, the game does increase a little bit in difficulty in the later chapters where using such tactics will result in losing almost every single minion. If you want a real challenge, you should forego any armor or weapon upgrades as getting the arcanium armor and weapons with full upgrades turns the last part of the game into a total cakewalk. The story also wrapped itself up rather abruptly (without spoiling much, you’ll suddenly feel like you’re at the end of the game without some necessary exposition). That being said, I really enjoyed the concept and will probably pick up the sequel sometime in the near future and I would recommend this game to anyone looking to try being the bad guy for once instead of the goody-twoshoes hero role we are so often shoehorned into in gaming.

												Overlord is an incredibly fun adventure, with surprisingly good gameplay if a little too easy. It nails just about everything else though; including the superb art style, the intuitive mechanics, the clever puzzle-solving, the engaging story and characters - and most of all - its sense of comfiness that few games can match. Not much else needs to be said, you should just experience the game yourself and you will see what I mean. Admittedly the game is a little short, in just twenty hours I managed to beat the game twice. Thankfully its sequel is just as good and considerably longer, so you should play that too.			"

Would strongly recommend the game I'm not even much of a fan of the genre and i still loved. The progression throughout is perfect and the story is great. although there are a few annoying things like some puzzles being bit annoying to solve (maybe I'm just stupid xD). Throughout the game you are even given choices for example you can choose between 2 sisters as a girlfriend one who is good and one who is evil. But yes overall the game is great and thats why i have got it on 2 platforms now.			"

												The game in fun when the controls cooperate. It really feels like a bad console port. If you are the kind of person who replays a level they didn't get a perfect score on this game will drive you insane. I find myself running into a battle and losing all controls for a solid ten seconds; once everything is working again, after frantic clicking, most of my troops are dead because they stood around waiting for me to issue commands...The reason I say bad console port is because most of the controls are just clicking differently with the mouse and for some reason if you click to fast or click to many times or click two different buttons within a few seconds of each other the game just gives up on interpreting what you are trying to do. Minions will just run around locked in whatever command you gave last or they will just stand around you and die. The further you get the more challenging the game and in turn the more frustrating the in-operability of the controls.I really do want to enjoy the game :(			"

												Very good game overall. I have never played these games before so I can guarantee it isn't just nostalgia that is causing all those positive reviews. I play this with a controller but I hear it plays well with a keyboard too. The gameplay feels entirely solid and fun, I mean who doesn't want to command tons of idiotic little minions and sit back and relax for the most part? I entirely recommend this game for its price and I'm sure the other games will be just as fun. Only complaint I have is with the controller you have to hold a button to rotate the camera which can be awkward at first but I got used to it before I realized there's a way to fix it. Everything else is absolutely fantastic and unique. Great buy in my opinion.			"

												Adventure games are one of the best type of games, and this, being evil and having minions (with different abilities for each element), combines many great styles into one beautiful, high quality game. The artists and level designers who made the worlds did an outstanding job, making the best enviroments I have even seen, and really know how to put detail into the job, and staying on the atmosphere of the zone. The game also shows very funny dark, impish humor. I would recommend this game to anybody and everybody. Get the full pack on Steam.			"

												Building an evil empire is hard work. Fortunately, minions love to do trivial tasks such as carrying heavy things, beating sheep to death with sticks and blades alike, putting stuff on their heads, immolating halflings, and smashing, well, everything in sight. It makes the tedium of smiting and being feared much more enjoyable.Between Steam and my console version of this game, I probably have about 100 hours in it, and every playthrough was fun. The four kinds of minions (conveniently color coded for an Xbox controller, which I do recommend using a controller given how laid back this game is, but it is hardly required) add a great layer of strategy to the game if you take the time to utilize them to their maximum efficiency. Of course, you can always just send them all rushing in to smash smash smash, and they will happily die for you, but they will die quite often this way. And you just don't want that when they're so adorably evil. Unless maybe you're just extra evil, and that's actually encouraged around here.I would not call this game particularly challenging (although Legendary mode added in the Raising Hell expansion surely amps up the difficulty), but it is pretty forgiving overall. This is definitely a pick up and play game that is not going to drown you in the details of lore, equipment, crafting, etc., but it has just the right amount of strategy involved to keep it interesting while allowing it to remain a game you can lounge back and play just to unwind and enjoy the ride.Fact is, sometimes you just want to be the bad guy. This game lets you be a brutal tyrant, but does so in such a charming way it just feels so right to be evil. So pick it up, build a horde, claim a mistress, restore your Dark Tower to all it's inglorious..er...glory, literally fill a room with gold and treasure, and sit back on your sweet evil throne, sipping wine made of fermented peasant tears, and debate how to punish your godawful jester.

												I really enjoyed Overlord. Anyone who has played and liked Nintendo's Pikmin series ought to give it a go!Prior to playing Overlord 2 I thought I'd take some time to look over the things I liked... and the things I didn't. I only played through the game once and may give it another spin later to try out some of the things I missed out on in the first playthrough.The game is quite puzzle-based but has its fair share of combat and RPG elements as well.Pros: Nice scenery. Interesting boss fights. Great puzzles. Unlike in Pikmin, the protagonist is quite capable of defending himself. Humourous dialogue. It just feels nice to play as the villain. ""You choose all!"" - I just love that quote Replay value. There are certain choices you make that you may want to replay the game for just to make the opposite choices.Cons: Lack of a map interface. I frequently ended up getting lost or losing the odd minion or two. Nowhere to review the controls. I took a break from the game, then came back not knowing how to toggle the different spells, so I ended up having to look it up online. Ran out of use for gold. I feel it would be nice if I could use excess gold to purchase more minion lifeforce or to upgrade equipment, because once I had built the last equipment set, gold seemed to be useless to me. Achievements would be nice.Overall I'd rate it 8/10 :)There's room for improvement but it's a neat game as it is.			"

												A hidden gem in the plethora of Action-Adventures. While it has its fair share of flaws (minions occasionally spawning in areas they can't get out of, dumb enemy AI, cheap ""difficulty"" boost which only serves to make the game more tedious), there is too much to like to really dwell on the negatives, but you should be aware they are still there. The story isn't immensely deep but deep enough to thoroughly enjoy, music can be good at times but it is just okay overall despite always being fitting, the minions are a blast to watch when pillaging nearby homes, scenery, and sheep... Being able to condemn your enemies with a simple hand gesture really immerses you in the Overlord character, and the minions are so full of personality you could just rip them out of the game and squeeze them. Despite being ugly little creatures, they're awfully adorable. That being said, I have played the game once as a good guy. Playing again as a massive jerk on Legendary difficulty (not something you should ever do unless you just want to say you did it) even after countless hours is more fun than the first time through. It has the charming replay value of a platformer along the lines of Spyro the Dragon.tl;dr play this "

												Eternal Badass simulator with a Pikmin control scheme and a doofy overtone. Controls take a while to get used to, the camera acts like a rampaging bull and your minions have a bad habit of running into water randomly. Fun game, if a little frustrating at times. Some of the best sound effects in gaming exist in this game as well. Also, I suck at reviews. Bye.			"

												I played this one a ton before I found it on Steam and rebought it here on Steam. This is a gem of a game and must have for anyones library.The puzzels and balance of abilities keeps the game fun from start to finish with a very stedy progression of story and difficulty that never leaves you feeling under or over powered ... more than your supposed to that is :) The LoLs in the game are what really sale it for me and what brings me back to it now and then, its sequal is just as good in my openion and the 2 paired is a grate addition to your library. I haven't played 3 as of yet not for a lack of wanting to simply a lack of time.			"

												Theres very few games i can honestly say i love, and get completely drawn into, i can probably count on one hand the few games i've become a nerdy addict too. One of those games is Fable, so i wanted something to fill that little humourous funny game void thingy left in my gaming heart after finishing those games. This is when i stumbled upon Overlord. Overlord is the best game i've played on PC so far, and considering i've only been playing for a few weeks i suppose that isn't saying much. But this game has the fun of an action'y fight'y kind of game. plus it has all the benefits of something thats relaxing and humourous, this game has made me laugh a few times, which is sad really... but thats beside the point.Basically you play as an Overlord (what a surprise) You have a selection of minions, and to clarify, no they're not yellow and they do not wear dungaree's and goggles! They are however, blue, red, brown or green, they each have their own special 'powers', which i think is in a way what gives this game a slight sense of strategy, in a weird deluded way. You must pick the right minions for each quest, inevitably some minions will die, or you'll kill them, so you or your minions kill different bugs to get 'orbs' of minion life, these orbs get stored at little colour co-ordinated crators where you can summon them at selected points in the game, you can also convert your minions back into orbs, or trade your minions in for health,  thus killing them.  Once you've selected your minions you purse through quests, throwing them into battles with a range of different creatures, and occasionally lending them a hand yourself, although the overlords fighting isn't the most thrilling and he doesn't have a wide range of weapons to chose from, he does have the benefit of 4 spells that can be cast, using your 'mana health bar' that can add a bit of a punch to otherwise space bar bashing when the minions need a hand. The quests follow a simple story line and you can pick up and drop them as you wish, which really adds a sense of Free roam to this game, you can simply teleport to most areas and view open quests in these areas from you're main tower which you can revert back to from the main menu or tower crator, this tower is also something you can upgrade through in game currency as you progress which is a nice little back feature, but not something i think the game necessarily needs and certainly isn't a big feature, just an added bonus. So in summary, If you've played fable and enjoyed it, you're 99.9% likely to enjoy this game, (You can even kick your minions if you miss days of kicking chickens!) if you havne't played fable, what is wrong with you? But just buy it anyways. There is nothing to not love about this cute little devious game!			"

												Many years ago I got the game on the 360, loved it so much. Found it on steam and have beat it like 10 times now. It is such a fun game with many different enemies and bosses, good long story, and hours of fun. I think you should try the game out as it is like no other game ive played before and its only $5. Also you every time you play you learn something new or a different way of doing something. After owning the game for several years and beating it completely, i still enjoy this game.			"

												A quirky walk on the wild side of Gaming. You play as the big bad himself, with an army of minons at your command.As the game progresses you unlock new armour, weapons, and of course, new minions which you will need as each provides it's own mechanics (Blues can swim, Reds can put out and throw fires, Ect).-The story is thin, but fun. And you wont be short of fun little characters to interact with. -The game suffers from horrendous pacing however. You'll spend hours figuring out how to progress, or just get bored tramping over what seems like endless streams of stuff to smash. Not to mention the insane amount of backtracking, although there will be new ways to interact with the environment thanks to new minions you might have unlocked. -Graphics are decent. Nothing more, nothing less. They serve there purpose well. There are however, some rather sinister design choices, and some of the characters look downright morbid and desturbing, and not in the good way.All in all, if you want to splash out in a sale, you could do a lot worse than this game. Just be aware it was also designed for Consoles, so bring a controller if you can.  "

												Overlord is a woefully average adventure game. It revolves around being an evil hero who quests through the lands slaughtering innocents and using your minions to do your bidding.It's strange since Overlord isn't just a hack and slash, which it is. It's also an action RTS, which comes into play while ordering your minions into combat. This is a fairly intuiative feature on the gamepad but not so much with mouse/keyboard. If you're at all interested in this game I recommend using a gamepad due to this.However that's where all my favorite bits end, as it stands Overlord is linear and fairly simple. It lacks RPG elements and any complex RTS/Sim elements. It is basically a darker version of Fable with elements of the Darkness thrown in. Only enter if you crave simplicity, which isn't always a bad thing.			"

												Well, i have played Overlord in 2009, since then im a different person. It became popular the join with Rpg and Humor in the same package. I can say when i was palying Overlord i was smiling :DThis game basically, helps you to relax and thinking  about your ""true colours"" at the same time.You controll your actions and the minions (like imps) and them combine its a lot of possibilites to do ""evil"" or ""true evil"" things. There´s a lot of costumization in this game since the Dark Tower at the weapons and armor in your Forge!But, unfortunately, the game have some ""less good"" aspects that i would like to mencion:- the physics of the main carachter, cause he walks like steping in grapes;- some drops, like armor and weapons for the minions, are in places that we can reach , cause opening the boxes will shoot them for mountains isides;- some buges in sent and call minions, cause sometimes the command paste causing losses of minions sometimes.And for the last, for me at least, Gnarl is the most iconic carachter in the game and you should meet him :D because and like he sys: "" I'm a true servant of evil (...) and evil always find a way"".

												This game is FUN!The map designs are nicely laid out, especially later on in the game when the puzzles start to get trickier. You'll find yourself perhaps just on the edge of your last bit of health and most of your minions dead, when you'll come across a  summoning spot or a crate with health in it. It is challenging and rewarding to play, and the humour is fantastic.If you're not a fan of grinding, make sure you take the time to learn when to recall your gremlins back at soon as you notice they might be in trouble - like drowning, or a boss about to do a strong attack. Losing too many will deplete your amount you can summon, forcing you to go back to old maps and grind down to collect life force. The good news is, most of these 'grinding' locations are very close to the map entrances, so you won't be there for too long.			"

												A wonderfully whimsical game that never got the acclaim that it deserved. Came out in 2007 but still holds up. Definitely challenging at times, but never frustratingly so, except for maybe the final boss. If you enjoy this then you will most likely enjoy Overlord 2, even though it wasn't as good as this one, it is still worth playing. I would reccomend getting the Raising Hell expansion with this, but don't attempt any of those missions until you finish the vanilla game.			"

The game gives you the option to ethier be completely evil, or a 'heroic' Overlord, or you could just do what ever you wanted and have the best of both worlds.Con's1. Some times it's not clear where to go, or what to do, but that's what guides are for.2. Some times (not all of the time) getting more minions can get a bit annoying but it's not imposible, I'll admit at least one hour of my play time was getting more minions.But what game is perfect? Answer: None. But you can certanly have fun with it. So yes I'd say try the game!			"

												This game is great if you like LOTR or Pikmin and completely freaking amazing if you love both! The great thing about this is you get to play as ""Sauron"" and control little smeagol looking minions. There are 4 different kinds of minions, brown, red, blue and green. Each type of minion is needed to complete almost every mission. You can also sacrifice hundreds of minions to empower weapons and such. Somehow, strangely enough, the minions are cute as they will pick up random things (like pumpkins) and wear them as armor, use zombie arms to attack whatever (yes this game has zombies), and keep gold crowns for themselves. Some tactics are needed when fighting large amounts of opponents or bosses. It's also cute (and makes you lazy as hell), that the minions will bring you gold, ""xp"" (used to summon more minions) and potions and offer them to you. (aka your a minion god to them). It's a lot of fun and well worth every freaking penny. My favorite part? Kicking the Minion Jester around. Pros:-A wonderful blend of LOTR and Pikmin (and zombies)-Amazing graphics (think Fable on steriods)-Great music-Fun interactions-Wonderful style of game-You get to be as evil as you want (and that's the point of the game)Cons:-What cons? lol-Maybe casting spells can be a bit of a pain.....but that's what minions are for.

												Overlord is one of those games where you are evil and it is actually very exciting and funny to be evil! Its hilarious approach is similar to that of Dungeon Keeper. The Overlord you control has the ability to control dozens of so-called minions - creatures that do the fighting and looting on behalf of you. This is a must as the Overlord cannot kill a handful of enemies single-handedly.  There are 4 types of minions each with unique abilities so the game requires you to carefully think about which race you want to send into battle against what kind of an enemy. The blue ones can cross water while the green ones are good against giant ogre-like creatures as they can jump on their back to swiftly eliminate them. Reds prefer ranged attacks while the browns are best at melee - and if all else fails the blue ones can revive your fallen soldiers.Your minions are hilarious along with some of the sidequests you need to complete. The main quest is basically a quest for revenge - your predecessor was killed by heroes and you need to take revenge for what they have done. It is a nice touch that the developers included a so-called corruption level: you can eliminate innocent townsfolk that will only make you more corrupt. This will eventually change the way you look like and the behaviour from these people around you.You can retreat to your own tower occasionally where you can carry out some upgrades depending on the looted items you have found throughout the game. There are also visual upgrades such as changing banners or statues. Single-player campaign offers a long and funny story and the game is getting gradually more challenging along the way. Overlord is a funny game! Other than Dungeon Keeper I cannot recall anything with a similar approach towards being evil which can only be fun in such games. It's worth picking up its bundle version which includes an expansion pack as well as the sequel to Overlord. "

												A Pikmin-like where you play as the Overlord, and control a growing horde of minions with color-coded abilities. The Overlord's health, mana, and horde size are upgraded by finding totems in the world and recovering them. The dark tower he calls home is rebuilt and upgraded through collectables and gold.Having a tone which heavily mocks Lord of the Rings, it is charming and clever. Characters are stylized with cartoonish proportions, and you are given the decision to be cartoonishly evil, or not.This remains one of my favorite games.			"

And evil rises... Again?Remember, this game is already old - yet it also is a classic game of the genre ""Play Evil"". The graphics are still fresh and crisp even on newer machines, the game is also less laggy now - because of the better hardware.The story is told fast, you are an ""evil"" Overlord, who uses his horde of Lackeys to the best effect of his own will, get as corrupt as you like and fight against... Well... Who would have thought: Maneating Hobbits, Bloodthirsty Unicorns and other vile stuff of ... Well you see already where this is going, Hobbits and Unicorns normaly are considered good or heroic creatures, but not in this game, not at all. You'll meeting some of the most original character in any Fantasy game that was published over the years, and you'll be surprised by the sometimes black humor, irony and sarcasm that this game has to offer to the player. ...and they lived unhappily ever after.Or so you might think, but no... In fact, in this twisted world it is a real pleasure to be an ""evil"" overlord, because evil sometimes is the exact oposite of what you might think in this game...Kick your Jester, punish him for good... Be as cruel as you can be against your enemies, and frighten the masses by displaying the most cynic abuse of power. And don't wince, because you don't look powerful when you wince, you just look foolish. Have I forgotten something? Oh yes, the recomendation. If you are not into this kind of genre you will find the game maybe a little frustrating, even ridiculous. But if you are either a fan of Fantasy games (Roleplay, Strategies, Sims ... whatever) or you are an avid fan of Villains before Heroes, then you would be pleased by this game - and it also offers a lot of riddles and puzzles too. Even it is not new, it still has it's bite... and once it's poison is in your veins ... you're poisoned! You won't get away from it, at least not without solving the game.			"

												I played Overlord back when it first came out, and remembered enjoying it quite a bit. I was excited to see it on sale here on Steam with its addon and sequel, so I picked them up dirt cheap.The game is pretty fun, with the story being staged with you in the role of the villain out to subjugate any and all you come in contact with. You get the option to choose between good and evil, but it's more accurately evil and really, really evil. The game play is fun, though a bit frustrating when you can't quite find how to get to the next area. I realized how much I've come to rely on the objective markers in newer games (Skyrim and such), when I had to actually think about where to go. Once you get all four minion types, the game really starts to move, because more paths to success are open to you.The primary negative to the game, I feel, is the minion control when using the keyboard and mouse. Controlling minions is often clunky, especially if you are standing just a bit too close to something you want them to interact with. It is exceedingly difficult to control the minions when they have to lure enemies to certain places or take timed explosives to certain points before they detonate (both happen a lot late in the game). It was really hard to move around while directing a minion, which made a couple of challenges lose their entertainment value quickly.Besides those few specific examples, however, I found the game to quite fun all these years after my first playthrough. The graphics are dated, and the story is very shallow, but it was worth the couple of bucks I spent on it. Just remember you are playing an older game when you start!			"

												Very original idea and runs smoothly and is funny seeing your minions do stuff like jump on a sheep and ride it around while hitting it in the back of the head with a club. It's fun to be the evil overlord and command your minions to run around and murder and ♥♥♥♥ everything up left and right. Pretty funny game. Overlord 2 is cool too and a even better version of the first game. The best part about the game are the fantastic graphics; they are very well done for its time and very pleasant too look at, very colorful, bright and glowing without being offensively bright and colorful. The game looks great.The only two really bad things I can think of are that 1. it does not have a map, so you just run around till you find what to do and 2. when your health gets low it does a loud heartbeat sound which is horribly annoying and there are never any health shrines near so to make it ♥♥♥♥ing stop I just warp back to the main tower then come back where I was. Never, ever stop playing this game for an extended amount of time or you will forget where you have gone previously and have to do a ton of walking around until you find where it was to go next. It was 5 months in between the last I played and I regret doing that big time after spending two hours walking around until I found the right place. Another problem with the game which actually is not too bad at all is bugs. Sometimes the minion counter will get bugged and show 0/5 when I have 20 standing next to me. It makes them not control right so I have to warp to the tower then back to the area I was in to fix it. Sometimes I can command my minions to go over a bridge to turn a wheel and they get killed by a enemy who I can't make them attack because he isn't quite in the line of sight, making me backtrack a long way to get to a minion summoning mound. Anytime you have to go back a long way to get to a summoning mound to get more minions, which is more often than it should be, it is painfully boring and unfun. The game is also very basic. You just give minions commands and can fight a little and that is about it. It can get boring if you play for long sessions but it is still a great game nonetheless.Otherwise, it is a great simple idea that is different from all of the other games out there and like I said it is hilarious to command your minions to run up and destroy everything, breaking pots and crates to find gold and carry it back to you saying things like ""for you, master!"" and knocking down halflings homes and setting them on fire, killing enemies, and whatever other tasks.The game is predictably somewhat linear, but hey, what game isn't. I am usually having too much fun to notice. Could've been a 8 or 9 out of 10 game, but because of all its issues I mentioned, 7/10.			"

												It's like Pikmin for the PC. It's great ! And it's a Dutch product, which instantly makes it about 5x better ! For those who don't know what the idea behind Pikmin (and therefore Overlord) is (shame on you !); you control a character who's being followed by 4 different kinds of creatures. In the case of Overlord you have blue ones (for water traveling), red ones (for fire traveling), green ones (for sneak attacks) and brown ones (for basic fighting really). You can send them all to the same location, or you can send only a specific group of minions to do something for you. You start with the brown ones by the way, and you'll have to unlock the rest during your playthrough. Anyway, you use them to kill enemies (the boss fights are excellent and very fun !), collect items and solve puzzles. The controls are frustrating when using the keyboard and mouse so I recommend using a controller, to those who have one. So, buy Overlord AND a controller. Trust me, you'll love it ![Rating: 87/100]			"

												The game has some minor issues that can slow down progression a bit or make combat harder (minions getting stuck, some areas seem unreachable until you find a ""well hidden"" path only your minions can take to get further, etc.)Other than that, it is a fun (&comedic) adventure RPG I can only recommend for everyone to play. It really keeps you playing and surprises you with unique obstacles you need to overcome (for me, especially the rolling enemies + tactics were new). The story and voice acting is great and you feel like you make progress with each upgrade you find. The tower customization feature is cool as well.Play it!9.5/10			"

I hope we will have overlord 3 in future .. man can dream right :)  .This franchise is so good ,fun ,addictive>> story wise and gameplay wise deff worth a money :)PS . i have so litle hours seen played just because i instaled Overlord and expansion Overlord rising hell so mine play time is seen on overlord expansion :p			"

												Imagine a world where the games Pikmin and Conkers bad fur day had a child, this would be the child. i say this because it is basicly Pikmin, gameplay wise. You control goblin-like creatures called ""minions"" to kill creatures or humans to gain tiny orbs called ""life force"" which in turn gives you more minions to summon. Now i say its kinda like Conkers Bad Fur Day because of the theme. It has some dark humor portions ie. there was a mission in the game which is encountered early which you make a giant enemy explode by hitting it with your melee.  Every game has its flaws which they have fixed in the second game Overlord II for example you cant turn the camera it turns on its own as you move. Also there is no minimap which means it can be difficult to find your way in the maps. overall i think it is a fun and entertaining game is it the best game? no i would not say so but it is worth trying out if you want something to do it has some elements of strategy. the hardest part of this game i would say is controling resources in this game. you need money and minions to craft and upgrade your weapons and armor.

												Overlord is in the simpliest words a small,tactical slaughter fest with a short simple story. The game is fairly old and isn't the best looking title however that is not what the game is about. It's about going around with your horde of minions and killing everything insight. The game has a little sense of humour which is fairly light and is not that difficult and you can simply send waves after waves of minions to beat enemies. The game has a very linear range of minions Brown(basic starting units mainly for straight up fighting), Reds (Putting out fires and ranged units), Greens (Stealth weak units which can remove poisonous  plants) and finally Blues (weakest unit with the abilty to revieve fallen minions). You must unlock the Reds first then it is up to you if you want to unlock the greens or the blues. I perfer to unlock the Greens then the Blues as i perfer the Greens. The game has you go around killing ""Heroes"" who have fallen to evil. The heros are a Halfing King, an Elf hero (who has became a tree), Paladin, a Dwarf king, a huge warrior and a Wizard. The game then decided what ending to give you depending on your corruption level (if you have been evil or not during the game). That's it really other than you can forge three types of linear iteams (armour,helmet and weapons), fight fallen enemies in a dungeon, upgrade your tower (no really need to) and collect relics (statues to upgrade health and mana as well as unlock new spells). So to me Overlord is a fun simple game worth yout time and money as it is enjoyable and relaxing.			"

												There's so much that can be said about this game, the developers did an amazing job with both the storyline and the mechanics of the game, just from playing the game for a few hours you really get a sense of adventure which makes you want to play more and more, there is always something to come back to, once you have finished the story its so fun to free roam around the various locations, every location looks different which makes it unique and eye catching.

												From what I've seen so far, up to the red goblins, this game is awesome. Good graphical style and application, cool stomping overlord character and minions are a lot of fun, it's kind of unique to be walking around with a bunch of little guys doing your bidding, with a dash of humour... It has a kind of Fable feel to it from the looks but I think this is better.			"

												Fun game but was so p***ed off having to farm a ****ton of lifeforce to upgrade all my gear to beat the last couple of stages but the determined woman in me wouldn't let it go. The war in my head so wanted me to just rage quit forever and /uninstall but the stubborn, determined woman in me just wouldn't let me damn do it. So, I ploughed on, did a ton of farming for lifeforce, upgraded my stuff and beat the game. And had to sit through some painful credits that I couldn't skip. But at least its done now and I can move on with my life.			"

												Its fresh take on the fantasy genre. Controlling your horde of loyal and evil Naši youth feels refreshing compared to the typical action adventure formula. It's got a surprising amount of depth and innovation in a lot of different areas of design, excellent humor, art work and sound. A gaming experience you won't soon forget.			"

												Overlord is in the simpliest words a small,tactical slaughter fest with a short simple story. The game is fairly old and isn't the best looking title however that is not what the game is about. It's about going around with your horde of minions and killing everything insight. The game has a little sense of humour which is fairly light and is not that difficult and you can simply send waves after waves of minions to beat enemies. The game has a very linear range of minions Brown(basic starting units mainly for straight up fighting), Reds (Putting out fires and ranged units), Greens (Stealth weak units which can remove poisonous  plants) and finally Blues (weakest unit with the abilty to revieve fallen minions). You must unlock the Reds first then it is up to you if you want to unlock the greens or the blues. I perfer to unlock the Greens then the Blues as i perfer the Greens. The game has you go around killing ""Heroes"" who have fallen to evil. The heros are a Halfing King, an Elf hero (who has became a tree), Paladin, a Dwarf king, a huge warrior and a Wizard. The game then decided what ending to give you depending on your corruption level (if you have been evil or not during the game). That's it really other than you can forge three types of linear iteams (armour,helmet and weapons), fight fallen enemies in a dungeon, upgrade your tower (no really need to) and collect relics (statues to upgrade health and mana as well as unlock new spells). So to me Overlord is a fun simple game worth yout time and money as it is enjoyable and relaxing.			"

Combine that with an enjoyable combat and command system makes this game a truely hidden gem that anyone who is bored and browsing the steam store should really give this game a shot.If you love smart british humor and playing as a ""villian"" in a story you should definetly give this game a look.

												If I could give a meh instead of yes or no I would choose it. The game is well done in my opinion but very very very tedious. Its just pikmin with a gimick. Also some logic to me is flawed. Like the fact your supposed to be some powerful villain yet your minions en masse are stronger than you and so are many enemies. How the hell can no minions realize they can easily womp you? No sprint so if you have to get more minions because of a mess up its a long trek to a spawn point if there are none nearby so if your not an expert get ready for tedious back and forths constantly especially in certain maps. Minion ai sucks. Its touch and go on any of them but the browns. the browns are good but the others are always touch and go. A damn compass or map would help too since I had to spend 2 hours trying to remember the map for the first area since it all looks the same. Oh and get ready for a bunch of tedious grinding on life force to spawn minions. Also the minions are humorous......BUT GET OLD VERY GOD DAMN QUICK. The same 5 or so lines repeat more often than arrow in the knee or nazeem himself.			"

												Bought, played for a little while.  I found the minion-based gameplay frustrating and annoying(I just don't LIKE directing the little buggers around), and the black comedy world wore thin very quickly.  I might have been able to get more out of it if I'd fiddled with the controls to get a setup that worked better (I found the defaults obnoxious) but the game didn't interest me enough to make it worthwhile.

												I like cheating on games,it's just fun. I've got a system play until I get bored or find somthing tedious and then cheat if I so desire.I just unlocked the black smith and realized I have to spend gold (already knew) and minions on upgradesI crafted a new weapon with 175 of them (browns) I decided to cheat minions and max make full set of armor as wellI finally change the value with out crashing the game and then go to make the armor/weaponsI can't spend them and now I also can't add any to them or the game crashes (adding as in putting units back in or collecting souls or trying to spend them)it's a one way door, take them out and that's itIf the owner ever reads this, I don't know if that's intentional or not but touche. *tips hat*			"

												I had wanted to play this game ever since it came out way back when, and I think that if I had done so when it was initially released on Xbox 360 my opinion of it would be more positive.  Unfortunately, despite my efforts to appreciate Overlord for what it was then as I play it now, I find it difficult to review it in such a vacuum (I should also note that I played this game using the Steam controller).Beginning with the positives, Overloard is set in a charming, comical, and vibrant world that flips the arachatypical approach of what would be considered a traditional ""Western"" fantasy kingdom.  In this Overloard certainly nails the aesthetic it was going for and comes off as a slightly dark and more twisted Fable derivative.  For what it's worth, the world is quite beautiful, unique, and surprisingly large.  The motley crew of characters you come across in your adventures fit the peculiar world and I found myself admiring everything from the music to the quirky animations of sheep frolicking in the meadows.Unfortunately, gameplay and design fall short of the same mark in quality.  Managing your various colored minions (which is important for solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles) became way too much of a hassle.  The camera rarely ever wanted to play nicely with the target auto lock and I found myself frequently annoyed when approaching puzzles that required a level of resource management (""resources"" here being you minions) of meager complexity.  That is not to say that the puzzles were themselves difficult to understand, but executing them became an exercise in frustration.  This was the first time in quite a while that I actually had a strong urge to throw my controller, even Dark Souls never was so mechanically burdensome to bring me to that point.Along with the aforementioned issue another major problem I had was that too much of the game relied upon your minions as an expendable resource.  Regaining health and mana, solving puzzles, upgrading weapons and armor, using them as your primary ""weapon"" meant actively fighting with the poor controls and camera to direct your horde(s) and perform what should have been simple tasks.  What's more is that this heavy reliance inevitably required with it a very boring gameplay loop that forced you to grind for the life-force to summon more minions.  So much of the early game centered around amassing your horde while holding off upgrading yourself until the late game with equipment that wouldn't feel like wasted effort.  Nothing ever felt fulfilling, everything revolved around the minions, but because they were expected to be sacrificed even attempting to equip them with more powerful equipment felt wasted.Sticking with it for a couple hours longer I was conflicted in my desire to continue exploring this gorgeous world while simulataneously never actually having that much fun playing it.  I eventually deleted my profile and uninstalled the game when I realized I was actively trying to convince myself that I enjoyed it than genuinely feeling that way.  Maybe if I was playing with a mouse and keyboard it would have been different, or maybe if I stuck with it just a little bit longer I would have gotten over that hump, maybe I was expecting too much out of a game getting on in years.  Whatever the case, I found that the frustrations I faced wasn't worth the time I was putting into it.  No, I certainly can't recommend this game, but a lot of people seem to enjoy it so there is definitely an argument here to purchase and play it.  There are a lot of genuinely great and novel ideas here which attracted me to play it in the first place.  On paper they would appear to be a recipie for success, but in execution they were cumbersome and I just don't have the time to fight with such issues.  As a MD student, my limited vacation time is valuable and I try to balance gaming with other recreational activities as best I can.  Others might find value here but I would much rather play something more immediately entertaining and with lasting appeal like Morrowind.			"

												3/10With all the hype I heard from this game I expected an enjoyable experience involving me controlling my minions, tormenting local villagers and their livestock, and being the badass I suspected I would be. No. That exists, but the game is so much worse than that.The mechanics work when they want to, the collision detection is either there or not, the combat leaves a lot to be desired, and the writing and voice acting is EXTREMELY poor. After spending hours roaming the forest, lost, and then later the dwarven hills, lost, it was apparent that this game needs a mini map in the most DESPERATE way. Even a normal map would have been fine just so I could know where the ♥♥♥♥ to go! Controlling my minions was enjoyable until I had 30+. Then it became an annoyance of trying to get all of them to cooperate together to get from point A to point B. They also like to drown in water. That’s fine I get it. However when the water is ankle deep and the minions are knee high and they drown I’M CALLING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!The combat is extremely bland, Most of the time you send your minions out to fight and only need 10 at most to destroy the living hell out of everything, but there comes a time where you just gotta get your hands dirty. ♥♥♥♥ THAT! The amount of times I had 5+ enemies surround me and I swing my weapon thinking, ""I'll get a hit on all of them and take them out in no time."" WRONG! You get surrounded be prepared to take some more damage than you thought. Each hit focuses on one enemy at a time. ONE? I'M NOT POKING THEM INDIVIDUALLY! MY SWORD/AXE/WHAT EVER I FEEL LIKE USING WILL HIT ALL OF THEM! NOT JUST ONE!I thought that maybe the forging system could help this in that I could get some bonuses and become even MORE of a badass. Wrong again. To upgrade and forger items you have to infuse them with the souls of your minions. And only certain creatures have souls to drop which doesn’t make sense since every enemy should drop some soul! So because I only get a limited amount of souls from creatures that destroy my minions easily you end up having to grind your face on a wall for an hour only to get 400+ souls. 400 is a pretty big number, however when crafting you can infuse up to 2000 souls. 2000?! This is for only 1 item. NOT EVEN AN UPGRADED ITEM! A BASE ITEM! SO I THEN HAVE TO SPEND MORE SOULS TO UPGRADE MY WEAPON! 3000 SOULS! I’m sorry, but having me use my 50,000+ gold would have been enough.Which brings me to the money system. You get money which you use to upgrade your tower and to spend on the crafting items. After spending all the money I could to upgrade my tower I ran out of useful things to spend it on and accumulated 50,000+ by the end of the game. I don’t see how they could have run out of things to use money on. Every time you summon a fresh minion it will either have armor it gathered from a previous mission or come out naked as the day it was born. Why not use the money to give any minions better armor? Better weapons? No you upgrade that by choosing a specific wench to join you in the tower. Wow. One upgrade. Don’t want to make you too overpowered in a game where your minions literally get ♥♥♥♥ on around every corner.""SPOILER ALERT""The story I thought was going to be pretty straight forward. Show dominance and you win when you become the OVERLORD! Not exactly. You go about finding minion nests, then take out some of the local annoyances and the come back to the tower to discover that you were just helping an evil wizard, aka the REAL Overlord, to sneak back into the tower and everyone to stab you in the back because ♥♥♥♥ you the other guy was here first a long time ago. You have one last puzzle with some loyal minions help and then fight said wizard in a fight that will be long forgotten by the time I read a text message.With all this I give the game a 3/10.A game with dodgy mechanics, unmemorable bosses, poor story and voice acting, maze like levels with NO maps, and systems that become redundant.

												I know its 8 years later but I got this game from a humble bundle and decided to write a review.  I originally played this game on PS3 and it worked was fun, not the best game to exist but was fun.  Well the PC version is different!  This version is so filled with small glitches causing you to restart the game over and over again which just breaks the fun.  If the dev who long since dumped this game fixed those gitches it would be a decent game.  They have not and will not!  The worst glitch is when your minions are holding something to bring back to your castle (to a portal) they sometimes randomly stop right at the portal and won't move further to put it down on the portal.  This glitch alone has made me restart the game several times.  If you have a PS3 get it on that.  For PC skip it!			"

												Hear is my review for overlord it's got a lot of problems and one of the bad points I thought about this game is is there a repetitive areas spoiler alert you got a collect different colour minions and every area you go to collect different colour minions is a different area but you do the same thing killing the enemy then Killing the boss getting minions you gotta do that 4 times and it gets very very very boring and you do this for most of the game and in general it is boreing you run around basically doing the same thing and I found it got very frustrating and the quest descriptions not very clear and hard to find what you doing and you run around like a headless chicken but saying that the minions are very funny the intro is very funny the storyline is  just getting minions to become the overlord to upgrade the tower to control some villages and the game is extremely hard and some of the boss is a crazy too hard and Overall I would not recommend buying overlord one personally I think it's too frustrating and to confusing and boring but saying that the minions are funny.  And there's a crafting system that you can use to make armour and weapons but the problem is that you use Souls two upgrade you get for killing enemies ok but when you make two armour pieces for example and then you want put fire on one and say poison on the othet and it is hard to see what chest piece you have on so you have to go back and forward from your forge to your wardrobe and check to find out what one you have on it is a Absolute nightmare and if you want to give you chest piece a health boost so you have to collect like a round 600 souls i know not quite right number but you end running around the same over and over again to get the Souls.  And you use the Souls two summon you minions and so you have to go back and kill things like sheep to get more souls and all sorts of things over and over and over again to get those that you have to go back and do it again and again it is crazy how many things you have to do in this game over and over again  "

												Just played through Overlord. Overall I'd probably give it a 5/10.Voice acting: Pretty terrible.Graphics: passablegameplay: quite fun, single redeeming featuremusic: forgettableYou are dug out of a crypt with no explanation of how you got there. It's time to be an evil overlord. Teleport around doing...stuff and building up armies of minions. The game was on sale for a few dollars so I figured I'd try it out.There were a lot of side features to this game that I didn't get into simply because I wanted to finish it. The plot hooks felt a little desperate and unnatural. I think a game in which the protagonist is evil requires a different kind of reason to go somewhere beyond ""there's a plague there.""There is a crafting system that requires you to sacrifice your minions to improve your equipment. However, the number of minions that I had to sacrifice to get some mediocre improvements actually backfired in the last level because I ran out of minions and had to grind/farm up some more.There's a few puzzles in this game, which frequently are a grind to get through. Combat is typically over very shortly when you overwhelm the opposition with your minions, or some new enemy wipes out large numbers of minions until you figure out how to beat it.I ran into a few annoying bugs, one that went in my favor and one that killed a lot of my minions.This game reminded me of Fable meets Pikmin. The whole game took me about 10 hours to beat, and for the last 4 of those I was getting antsy to see the end because I wasn't having much fun. Frankly I would have gotten more enjoyment from playing Pikmin again. The controls were a little clunky. Virtually every piece of dialogue was so tropey/cliched/badly voice-acted that it made me wince on a few occasions. This game wasn't bad, but felt like a chore to get through, and I beat it in 10 hours.  "

												Overlord (my game includes the 'Raising hell' DLC) is essentially a Pathfinding game wrapped up in a cute graphics and a story of an Evil Overlord carving out his domain.It is good for what it does but the concept, the style and the game play soon run out of new tricks and after a couple of hours in it starts to be more of a grind than a pleasure.There are a few things that really annoy me but the biggest is the incessant Cut-Scenes.OK, i get it you are trying to tell me a story but why would you break up nearly every major fight with flow-stopping cut-scene? It gets really tedious and in the end i cared less about the story because of it... i just pressed <space> to fast-forward.I am still playing it and will play it through, it is less boring than watching TV and so it is a good little filler in-between other stuff but honestly, if i stopped playing it tomorrow and deleted i would not miss itOh, and the lawn-mowing mini-game is a steaming POS			"

												This game deserves some credit; they wanted to use a controller, and give you the kind of control you are used to with a PC. And honestly, they do a decent job, because that's a hard task. When you first start this game, it seems like it's going to be some form of an RTS; you controlling The Overlord directly, but also directing his growing band of minions.  The Overlord uses magic and melee, while different kinds of minions attack physically, magically, stealthily, etc, and you control it all directly. Pretty cool.Well, it should be. Despite doing a surprisingly good job as I said above, there are still many problems. I've quit and reloaded several times (irritatingly limited save system) because my minions have all charged into fire or poison gas or a lake and died immediately because of a button press. My fault, yeah, I did it. But why should it even be possible to murder all your followers by ordering them into a river? Just make them stop at the water's edge so that if I accidentally, even one time, forget to change over to just the minions who walk on water, I don't lose the whole level and die. And this happens more than you would think, because this game is not a strategic combat game, it's an action/adventure game with puzzle elements. The minions are mostly there to get through puzzles that become increasingly irritating. Because the perspective is directly on the Overlord, it can be difficult to control the minions at a distance (in fact, you lose all control after a surprisingly short distance). They run into things, they aren't standing quite where you thought they were, they get lost. It's also kind of annoying to do things like seperate the minions, position them, recall them out of comabey they have been ""locked"" in to, etc. Really, the Overlord is actually a pain in the butt; he's a hindrance and a distraction, as he's not very tough or useful most of the time. If he was not there, or just there as a Wizard with a magic barrier who follows the minions around and you just control THEM, it would be far better, because you'd have more buttons to work with, instead of several just to control the very basic avatar. And the puzzles are not hard; it's one of those games where you know what to do immediately, but can't effectively do it. Constantly fighting with hit-and-run tactics, trying to navigate over terrain that's difficult to see (although you can change the camera angle, that robs you of the ability to see more than 20 feet away), it really just drags. The combat parts are the fun parts, and with some tweaking to the mechanics and different levels design, it would of been a fun and somewhat unique combat game. Instead it's an average action-adventure title combined with an easy puzzle game. It's not terrible, but it's frustrating, and straddles too many fences to offer any depth or satisfaction in any field. The first 2-3 hours were fun, then it starts to slow down, and by ten, I just threw down the controller in frustration, as I couldn't get through 30 minutes without something going royally wrong (including freezes, enemies cheaply spawning right behind you and killing your weakest guys in a flash, and the fact that you can't unsummon your minions when needed). Good effort, in a way, by the devs, but it's not enough to make the game really worth playing.			"

												The second overlord was a better game, the first there were major negatives which only new game devs would do1 (Some Negative + Some Positive): Level Balance: This has become a major issues for lots of games, balanced npc levels, some above average in this game possess this negative trait which makes the game not worthit at all, though all the other npc levels are balanced, aka weapon damage, hp etc the ""bandits"" that raided ""castle spree"" and work for the character ""Jewel"" are unbalanced.2 (Negative): Level Difficulty: in this sence of overlord using ""maps"" not like levels, but the map ""Ruborian Desert"" has proven to be a hard one and almost time consuming, some of the people i talked to said that the 1st overlord is what brings shame to the overlord series because of these issues that the devs have made, for an example the Ruborian Desert makes the game shunned on because of the sand-worms, there is a few too many and just ruins everything instantly while trying to make your way on how to even get inside of the thief hideout.3: (over halfway of between negative and positive) Campaign Length: This is not a issue but a downer, most people complain it is too short, mixed with level difficulty on a high scale this has created a game issue that all the way takes the game down.4: Other Info + Personal Thought Of Game: the Devs have ""completed"" (So not completed) this game (if it can be classed as a game than a time waster) i would advise you to stay playing mobile ports that are being placed into the PC, or trying overlord 2 since its the only overlord game thats on steam that is not hardcore or broken (and wrecked) at a certain point, it is still fun to play but once your at the ruborian desert = Delete save, restart again. and enjoy the past of when you just completed the game (because you cant get any further!)5: Overall: Sort of. i would recommend buying the game but once your at the ruborian desert thats the end of the story there, you cant get any further because it appears to be a ruined level from what i asked other overlord players and my personal opinion.

												Where do I begin.... I loved Overlord!!! Temple hopping, tuk-tuks, cold coconut water, fresh mandarin juice, minion massage, getting lost in the 10k vendors at the Tower, iced coffee in Chinatown,Khao San Road, the pastel sunset over the Grand Palace, old men searching for the perfect amulet, ladies with washing machines in the woods, money exchange clerks that give you a piece of candy with each transaction, barefoot monks carrying bowls, charcoal cooked pork on a stick, pad thai, banana nutella's, creamy coconut ice cream, chanting, ringing the bells at the top of the Wat, cold water from 7-11, backpacking young adults, young families with kids, and retired folks, fuzzy red fruit, fish pedicures, stingray wallets,sapphire earrings, Singha beer, unexpected bursts of tropical rain.

												TL:DRIts boring and drags on incredibly long. Its a budget game so don't expect a whole lot either.I would say Overlord was like Pikmin, if I had ever played Pikmin I think.  Unfortunately like some other games where you command units while being a character yourself the actual gameplay that you do (you directly hacking and slashing) kinda sucks. There isn't a real fighting mechanic here, not even any rolls (the stuff popularized by Dark Souls) you just hammer the attack button or take a few steps back or use a magic spell.  This is really more of an RPG and a puzzle game than something about combat...or atleast thats what I think its supposed to be that. The puzzles thus far have required ridiculous amounts of back tracking at times and basically trying every path in the game till I find the one I need to go down or till I look up a guide. The announcer/narrator is basically useless most the time in helping you solve problems. He will make a statement that will make absolutely no sense and its impossible to tell if this is applicable to the issue at hand or if its just random lore that dousn't actually matter. Am I supposed to just brute force and kill an enemy or use the narrators information to beat it more easily, tough ♥♥♥♥ figuring it out when theres no items or items of context in the area.Controls are a pain, it can be hard to get minions to do what you want them to do and thats using a joystick/gamepad/controller. This can mean they stand there and let themselves get killed one by one or they end up running into a wall or getting stuck at a waters edge or to far from you. Its just a major pain in the ♥♥♥ managing them to the point between this and the pisspoor quests/backtracking and uninteresting combat that whatever good features this game has dousn't even seem to be worth it. It looks and sounds good enough, but gawd its a boring and uninteresting game and not a particularly good RPG either.Maybe I'll find a gem in the rough if I play later, but this is one budget title thats really padded out.

												Wonderful idea, decent cutesy graphics, hilarious voice work, sluggish controls, confusing mechanics, some nasty bugs and a main character who's movement speed is juuuust the wrong side of infuriatingly slow. If you're REALLY into it, or get lucky and don't encounter any problems, you'll probably love this game but I've entirely lost my patience... :(I'm writing this after my fourth attempt at the same level after three separate bugs forced me to restart. One crash, one glitch into terrain and one incidence of bad design left me stranded with no way to complete the level. There's no quick-saves, only progress-based autosaves, so if something goes wrong you'll have to replay large chunks of the game over again. Additionally the Metroidvania-ish level design forces you to do a lot of back-tracking.When it works it's a lot of fun. Pillaging hobbit holes, building my evil lair and watching my hordes grow and arm themselves was compelling for a few hours but, in the end, my frustration overcame my enjoyment.			"

												Disclaimer: Inflated game time. Time needed to complete one playthrough: 16h (all content).A very long time ago I remember picking up Overlord for forty euro's on launch day at the local game store. How that seems to feel like ages past. I first played Overlord when I was very young, and when I played it I was immediately hooked. I still have the physical retail copy sitting in my closet, still filled with maps of every single dungeon that I myself drew, because I loved this game THAT much. Now that I finally replay it more than seven years later I have absolutely no idea why I loved this game, and that goes to show you that time doesn't wait for anybody. Overlord is a buggy game, as it has crashed multiple times on my system. Overlord has absolutely abysmal controls. Not because the concept of moving yourself around and controlling minions is difficult, but because the controls are unresponsive and clunky. Sometimes the controls simply would not work: I made the input and nothing happens, often leading to your plan being ruined and causing much frustration.Overlord is also a game of high promises made shallow and paper-thin. You control a poor man's Sauron through a parody of popular fantasy landscapes in search of a plot. You aren't doing this alone, as you have a small and unintimidating number of brain (and AI)-challenged minions who follow you around and ""obey your every command"". While I jokingly said that you were in search of a plot, I was only semi-serious. Your quest is to avenge your predecessor by slaying all seven Heroes who vanquished him, and, while you're at it, re-take over the world. All seven Heroes have become corrupt due to wealth and fame bestowed upon them for succeeding in the quest they undertook. Rhianna Pratchett of all people wrote this game, and while there are occasionally a few ""Haha. That's funny. I guess.""-moments in the game, most of it honestly feels very forced. It REALLY doesn't help that every single character looks the same, and looking at the lip-synching too long may make you go blind. Seriously, the lip-synching in this game is the stuff of belly-aching hilarity. Or just horror. When anybody talks, it looks as if the game is honestly glitched, of if the animator had a mouth-foaming seizure that day and the janitor had to fill in the blanks.Graphically the game still looks okay in my book. But be warned, people: 2007 was still in the age of overused bloom and plastic looking textures, though the developers DID try to avoid this in Overlord. The screenshots do a very good job at showing you the actual visuals of how the game is going to look on your screen, minus the UI, of course. The real problem with this game is that it's overly ambitious to make you feel like an Overlord, a true Dark Lord of Evil, but this promise rings just as hollow as any cave because the Overlord:-can be easily stunlocked in combat by slugs;-controls and fights like he has a broomstick up his an*s;-has an EVIL TOWER OF DOOOOOM that only has four ""large"" rooms to explore;-(said tower can also not hold more than one mistress for a reason that's never explained to us);-can at the very maximum carry 50 weak minions with him;-has to find the objects that ALLOW him to carry more minions with him, because he starts out with a maximum of five;-has four types of Minions to choose from, yet out of four, three of them can die almost instantly in combat;-has a Minion Master that apparantly runs every single decision for him, not making him as an Evil Genius but more of a a Silent Dumb Soldier.... but I guess ""Silent Dumb Soldier"" as the title of this game wouldn't have broken the bank in terms of sales numbers (as if there wasn't enough of that back in 2k7). All joking aside, I do hope you guys see my problem here. This is a game that just brings the bare minimum of what is promised and after playing it again it just isn't my idea of what a fantasy evil master would do. That's not to say that this game is worthless though, there IS hard work poured into it, but it's 'One of Those Games' where you have to make your own fun, because the game certainly won't make it for you. As always, only buy it when it's on sale. Hopefully Overlord III will make some of my evil ambitions come true.My specs:Windows 7 64-bitIntel Core i7 920 2.67GHz6GB RAMMSI 660Ti OC Power Edition			"

												Overlord has interesting game mechanics that enables you to command an army of his own to defeat enemies. The Overlord himself is quite weak while the character building is mainly focus on the minions the player command. This tests the your ability to strategize your minion types and how well you control them. It makes the game quite fun when you overcome a challenge that overwelms both you and your army. But I wouldn't recommand (or try to get it at discounted price) because of some major (imho) flaws.I am 8 hours into this game while writing this review. That is because this game makes you run around way too much. It feels like this game is designed to deliberately waste your time. First of all, there is no map feature. No compass of any sort. I sometimes agree that map is distracting in a HUD, but this game requires you countless times to obtain a specific item (those ♥♥♥♥ing sticks) in a dungeon in order to progress to the next part. Without a map, you will make a wrong turn occasionally. Sometimes you are just completely lost and you have to go through every room to find the place you want to go. There should at least be some kind of indicator for me to find my way back to my objectives, but there is none.The WORST THING about this game is how useless the waypoint gates are. They are completely not accessible at all. It's like a handicap parking stall with only enough space to park a small hatchback. Seriously, it makes me mad everytime i see one waypoint because they are useless. Unlike waypoints in other free roaming rpg games, you cannot use them to travel freely between waypoints. It's only use is to take you back to your tower (home). Well wtf, now they just waste my time for no reason. But wait, it's EVEN WORSE than that. From your tower, you can only teleport to major towns (which so far I only have three) and the last visited dungeon. The lifeforces (used to summon minions) are area specific, so when you run out, even when you know where to find them, you cannot go there directly. You have to teleport one of your major waypoints (which all of them are super far away from the location you want to go) and WALK. This is very serious, this is like the game breaking flaw that might render this game unplayable.Finally, the puzzles in the game are quite dull (so far). Feels like a cookie cutter design. It follows a formula of: you can't pass area until you get the red minion. You get the red minion, but look this green gas will require you to get the green minion to pass. so on and so forth. Even after I unlocked all 4 minions, the puzzles are still boring.This game is not bad by all means, but it could use a lot of serious work. Now I feel really relucant to continue playing because I feel this problem will add onto itself when I unlock even more playable areas. I really don't want to waste time doing things that make me not enjoy the game. Plus that old imp is just ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Try it out if you have the $$$ since its not that expensive, but if your serious about how your time is spent, stay the heck away from this.			"

												This is my very first review.The premise of this game was rather intriguing. You control little little minions to do your biding, ala pikmin style. Except you're evil. Really evil. There is even a mechanic where if you go out of your way to do evil things, such as kill peasants, you receive a certain percentage of corruption. This corruption ultimately determines a 100% chaotic ending, or a good ending. If you lean towards being good, the appearance of the overlord changes. If you however choose to do evil deeds, such as kill NPCs, your appearance will also change. Spikes grow out of your armor and the overlord emits an unsettling red glow.. As charming as this all was, many things brought down my experience with this game. 1. Combat & Controls. Oh dear, the combat. It feels quite clunky. Especially how the overlord swings his weapon. It feels as though it doesn't have much weight to it. You have one standard combo. Also, attack is bound to the spacebar with no way to rebind keys! In no way is this acceptable! I would prefer to attack with my left mouse button. I know that the minions are supposed to fight for you, however, I would at times like to do some fighting of my own. Controlling the minions wasn't so bad at first, until I was controlling a large swarm of them. The clunkyness of the controls becomes evident later on as you gain access to more minions. You are however able to split them up into groups, which helps to a certain degree, but I still had issues when I would have 30-40 of each, all trying to collect something or kill a big monster. It felt like attempting to control a mouse through a maze that has a strong will of its own. You want it to do this, or go this way, but it just won't obey.2. Graphics: Being a seven-year-old game, it will of course not look as gorgeous as modern games. The art style is charming and fits a comical fantasy world such as this. I find certain character models to be humorous, especially the halfings. There are graphical issues, though. All of which I will mention below under the bugs section. 3. Level-design: This aspect of the game really affected my enjoyment. Areas were quite large, thus requiring much backtracking. One of my main gripes in any game is excessive backtracking. About halfway through, I was in a forest. Without giving away any major spoilers, the task at hand was to take down some roots connected to a peculiar tree. Halfway through this ordeal, I had to go to an entirely new area to gain new minions just so I could progress in the previous aforementioned area. While it is nice to be introduced to new areas, having to move onto a new one abruptly was jarring. 4. Characters & Story: I wish the overlord could speak. It would make for some interesting situations. While some interactions are amusing, most of the characters are forgettable, annoying, or just plain cheesy. As for the story, you are given quests for each area with more quests given to you along the way, which all contribute to a story in each area. Which, in turn, contributes to the overarching story of the big evil baddy conquering the world. There however isn't much to the story, nor much depth. A shame since a story is a big aspect when it comes to the overall experience of a game such as this.5. Bugs: This is what truly broke my experience with the game. At times there would be graphical glitches. Parts of the ground would't render properly as well as walls. There were Random crashes aplenty as well as random slowdowns on a high-end computer. Then came the infamous elevator bug Elevator Bug: In order to progress in a later part of the game, you are required to find two missing levers to complete a rotating wheel. This wheel is used to raise an elevator. With the levers found, I directed my minions to move the wheel. The elevator arose. But something was wrong. When I tried to go inside, it would not go to the next area. I tried leaving the area, going back to the tower, even exiting the game and going back. Nothing worked. While not everyone may encounter this bug, is it one I encountered that stifled my ability to even finish the game.Sidequest Bug: For contribution to the 100% chaotic ending, there is a sidequest in the starting area where you have the option to capture maidens for your tower. You must capture 10 of these maidens spread throughout the area. After finding 7/10, I came upon the next two. So I did what any overlord would do: Swarm them with 50 minions and have them carry her to the nearest portal! Muahaha! But, something was wrong. My minons carried both maidens to one specific spot and then they wouldn't budge. I ordered different minions to carry them. I captured them out of order. I exited the game and went back in. No matter what, they would always carry them to the same spot and not move. Thus, I was unable to finish the sidequest.TLDR Version:While this game starts out enjoyable with many quirks and amusing moments, it is full of many issues. Most of which become prevalent as your progress. The incessant bugs, controls, excessive backtracking, lack of intriguing characters and story as well as repetitiveness ultimately bring this game down. I unfortunately cannot recommend this game.

												I find I'm mixed on this game.  At first it was a great new game mechanic with some good humor.  The story was pretty much non existant but that was ok the game play was fresh and new. Then I hit a point where I was burning through minions faster than I could generate them and to keep making progress I was going to have to start doing a lot of grinding type work to increase my hoards and try again.  At that point I was done.			"

												This game has crashed on me an absurd number of times... well over 40 at this point.  Sadly, sometimes when it crashes it actually wipes out the save game, forcing me to start over.  I've started over 3 times now.    There are several others complaining about this in the forums/discussions.Recently I had made it further in the game than I ever had before and can't pass one of the levels because my minions keep getting stuck on the geometry and won't come back to me when I call them.  I noticed there are people complaining about that, too.I gave up and uninstalled it.  I emailed Steam support asking for my money back and they said no.  So, buyer beware.  I hate that companies are legally allowed to sell us non-working crap, and then when we realize we didn't get what we paid for they're allowed to simply say ""Too bad, better luck next time! Thanks for your money!""  No wonder so many people pirate games.  :/			"

												I cant believe this game was made around 2007, many good games were made in this year, but why making this piece of crap Overlord?The answer is - money.No fun gameplay, plot and effort in it. Only ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cartoonish style and lots of goblins, who always die.We playing as somekind of warlord, who fell from a rock and died many years ago. Some goblins (who served him before) decided to ressurect him (what kept them so long?).Our ""hero"" is silent like ♥♥♥♥ing Gordon Freeman, maybe it will make him look badass? No. He can control those stupid goblins to kill sheeps and some town folk, for his own pleasure. Also he willingly accept everything elder goblin is saying, like a puppet.Gameplay is annoying and slow, you move there because you dont know, no one will give a map, figure it out yourself dumbass. And of course you will fight monsters, elves and other ♥♥♥♥ around, with your rusty axe. Pfff1/10 By the way, you can decorate your own castle with stupid curtains			"

												This is the only game I've encountered so far which can reliably generate motion sickness in 30 minutes, at least for me. I've played this game exactly 3 times and each time I got sick after 30 minutes. Hence my total play time of around 90 minutes so far. Funny thing is that I struggle to remember any other games which have had such an effect on me. I cannot remember one.So, for a mere motion sickness I give it thumbs down. Otherwise I liked the game so far (haven't seen much yet) and intend to finish it sometime in the future.			"

												Overlord is an action/strategy hybrid that has you ordering masses of weak minions about as an equally weak evil (or just evilish, depending on how you respond to the binary ""choice"" system) Overlord (heh, eh). Without your minions you suck, and small masses or individual minions suck worse. However, together you and the little red/green/brown/blue imps can form an unbeatable team of chaos...so long as you can master the controls and don't have too many technical issues.The worst thing about this game are the controls. Overlord is an experience that demands a level of precision and skill that my controller and I are incapable of. Initially pleasant and open levels give way to tight-corners and enemy puzzles that require quick and accurate adaptation on the fly, yet the camera is incapable of keeping up. On the controller, the stick you would normally use for controlling the camera is used to guide your brain-challenged minions around the environment. Using the mouse allows for easier camera control, but I couldn't ""send"" my minions at anything when I tried it. The camera follows either you or a minion you're controlling, and if you're trying to move and control minions at the same time in tight spaces it has a tendency to freak out or try abrupt and nauseating angles. The camera has two settings, behind the back and top-down, but neither is useful.A terrible camera isn't a killer, but poor minion controls are. Later levels have you coordinating your four minion types by role: Greens back stab, Blues heal, Reds throw fireballs, and Browns soak up damage. You can pin and recall groups of minions to/from spots, but while the pin function is individual to your selected units the recall function will recall ALL units, which can easily and quickly ruin any plans you might have. The challenge of the game exacerbates this, as all minions but the Browns die extremely easily. The Blues are almost useless if not for their healing, and many enemies in later levels are entirely immune to the Reds. Additionally, the only way you may replenish your army is by killing certain enemies, while every new encounter seems designed to go through a sizable number of minions to just get it done (figuring everything out is usually the easy part). So, by the second to last boss fight I managed to run entirely out of the only minion who could do reliable damage to ANYTHING in the level, and the only way to earn my minions back would be through extensive, boring, stupid, ugly grinding.Finally, the game lags on my computer. Mostly it seems related to if/when I run ANYTHING in the background, but other times it slows down for no apparent reason. It's extremely odd, and makes no sense given the number of things I can otherwise run just fine.I want to recommend Overlord for the opportunity to play the leader of a mob of idiots, but the controls just ruin everything.

												When I write these reviews, they are based of my personal experiences with the game. Now with that being said. This game  in my is garbage but I can see how people can enjoy it. This game has similar mechanics to Pikmen, you run around and then gain more and more followers and you can use those followers (In overlords case ""Minions"") to over come challenges. This game seems like it has an amazing story from what I have played. But I could never keep myself intrested enough to play it very long.			"

												overlord is probably one of the worst games I've ever played. I am writing this review, begging people not to suffer through it. The controls are confusing and never work right. The combat is so unbelievably boring that you dread every fight, and there are enemies constantly, making the game extremely annoying. The fights seem to play out randomly too. Sometimes, you can breeze through enemies no problem, but if you die or restart, the same place could feature a completely new set of rules. Many times have I restarted somewhere after killing several enemies with ease, to find much stronger enemies of the same type that constantly respawn. Who needs consistency i guess? The minions themselves are impossible to control. Each color does something unique in combat, but they never seem to want to do it. Instead they will just stand there and let themselves die. They are supposed to attack automatically when set to a marker, but that is rare. The game has some good qualities, but I can't seem to remember them over all the bad. There are several weapons and armor you can upgrade to, and you can imbue them with powers depending on what minions you put into them. These powers do not work. So there goes that nice feature. There is a variety of spells, but I can't ever remember which F key is which of the 12 and I just end up forgetting about them entirely. Some of the spells are confusing to use also and they all drain your mana so quickly, there's almost no point in using them anywayAnd the game is looooongggg. Maybe...I 'm not sure actually. Yeah it is, 20 hours in and I'm almost done, I think. It just feels super long because its so dull and boring. It feels like it never ends. There is no story driving the game, you just kind of walk around (very slowly I might add) and just do stuff, killing enemies over and over. The worst part is the game starts out ok, but the more I play it, the more I hate it. If I didn't beat every game I buy, I would have quit this one long ago.			"

												What good there is in Overlord is overshadowed by the terrible controls, dumb minion AI/pathing, complete lack of a minimap or world map, and generic high fantasy setting. I found the novelty of bossing around your braindead toadies wears off after a few hours when you rarely use them for anything more interesting than telling the right minion type to remove the conveniently color coded barrier, and thats a shame.

												You play as an all powerful lord of chaos and evil. Except for instead of chaos and evil, you're forced to do good deeds for unless you want to get awful rewards and make the game a bigger pain in the ♥♥♥ than it already is (which makes the entire premise of the game a lie), and instead of being all powerful, you die in about 3 hits unless you have your annoying goblin minions do everything for you by controlling them in an RTS fashion. This isn't an RTS, it's a 3rd person game, where the camera is behind your character (who moves like he desperately needs to find a toilet), and in 3rd person games, manually tracing a path for NPCs doesn't work. Neither does setting them up in strategic spots. Neither does selecting between multiple units. You want a game where you play as an all powerful evil dude? Go track down a copy of Destroy All Humans. You want an RTS game where you can control evil factions? Go get one of the Dawn of War games. But don't buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥.			"

												I can understand that many people find it a good game, but it's not for me.  I have just finished the two first bosses (out of 7 plus whatever has the expansion), but I can't get myself to keep playing, I just get bored thinking that I have to play to this. And that's a bad sign...but the absolutely worse of this game (objectively, apart from being boring for me), is the lack of a map. seriously I kept wandering around the forest, just going round, passing a lot of times for the same place. also there are no good quality (as in you can actually see something) maps out there.... that could have done.all in all, I can't really recommend this game, since *for me* it gets boring after a while, and it has no map so you keep wandering around without going anywhere. but I can understand that some people  like it. in fact, the minions are quite fun. luckily I got it almost free in a bundle, so it's not a great loss.

												I totally agree with those that complained about a lack of a map, or even a quest indicator... I wasted SO MUCH TIME wandering around trying to find what I'm supposed to do next (the quest list gives you nothing).  The game is appallingly lacking in any direction, instruction, and guidance.  Eg. Some areas will indicate where you are going when moving from one zone to the next, by showing what that area is, but most DON'T.  You have to blindly wander to the new zone, wait for it to load, see whats there, then have to retreat (and another load), because it wasnt where you wanted to go.At one point the game crashed out on me (just after getting the red minions), and now I cant get them again, cant find anything else to do that doesn't require them.  ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME.  Ive tried playing this game a few times over the years, and every time it ends up just being a boring wander around the countryside.  Its a great concept, nice graphics and sounds, and a sense of humour, but the playability aspect SUCKS, the controls are dodgy and cannot be easily changed, difficulty curves are all over the place (mostly too easy, then some too hard).  There is no story either (at least as far as I've been able to tolerate playing this piece of crap).  Don't waste your money or the download... I made the mistake of purchasing Overlord 2 also, and don't think Ill even bother to look at it.			"

												This is an amazingly fun game. The graphics are beautiful for its time and it reminds one of Fable when playing. (Though I'm not 100% sure, I believe some of the same voice actors are present in this game)  Basically, you are awakened as the new Overlord and your first priority is to retrieve the 3 lost Minion clans which each have special powers of their own. Browns (Your starters) have all the power. Greens (Your assassins) are a lethal group, though they can't take the hits as much as the browns. Reds ( Can dish out the long distant damage and are great for area advantages such as ledges and whatnot) One hit and they are goners. Lastly, the Blues (Revivers) that's pretty much all they can, oh and they're the only ones who can defeat magical creatures.6 hours in and there is already a mass amount of content. For starters, you can customize your very own tower. Everything from banner colors to so much more. Then there is the arena, in which you and your minion horde takes on foes in which you've already defeated. There is the smelter, in which you make new armour/weapons and upgrade your current armour/weapons as well as your minions attack and defense as well. And also..well so far..that's I'll I've gotten.It's exciting viewing the beautiful scenery as well as the hearing the crude humor which this game offers. It's a great laugh. Though there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of story present, that's not a problem. You are mostly doing random quests and deciding whether or not to grow your corruption level. Killing equals more corruption. Not killing..is pretty much being good. There is quite a bit of strategy involved which is nice. Example, certain trolls will wave their arms before hurdling themselves in the air and doing body slams. Your job is to notice this signal, call your minions back (sparing them such a horrible fate) an finally throwing them back in their after it's landed. Figuring these things out is exciting on it's own. Overall, the Fable nostalgic feel I get from the graphics and certain characters in this game make it a pretty great game, for me at least. Also, the gameplay as well. I start feeling connected to my little guys and though it's not necessary, I always tend to see myself in the mix of battle. The content which you get for the price in fantastic, but if you want more, it's worth the cash to get Raising Hell instead, simply because it's an expansion to this game.The only cons for this game involve the random minion glitches. Occasionally, the minions will be carrying items and simply stop. Even if nothing is blocking their paths. Also, minions themselves tend to get stuck in or under objects as well, but not too often. This usually occurs when some of your other minions are carrying items and they just happen to get in the way. Overall, They do a phenomenal job following your orders, only 1 time have I had a minion lost and I've had to backtrack it.			"

												A rather fun hack and slash game with the unusual brand of evil satire. It's always refreshing to play a game where you arn't the 'holier than thou' good guy. It's a decent console port aside from the controls ... just don't try to play it on anything other than a gamepad. Don't get me wrong, it's still playable with the mouse/keyboard, but it is a siginificant handicap. Even if you change the key configuration around, you'll face situations where you'll have to use ~3-5 keys at the same time while moving your mouse.			"

												I bought this game on the cheap for a couple of bucks and while I haven't played but a few hours, i'm finding this to be a pretty fun game. Being able to send your minions to do your dirty work is a cool aspect of the game and I can't wait to finish this one up and move on to Overlord 2.While I don't see there being much replayability, I only spent a few bucks and in my opinion got a pretty sweet bargain for a game I didn't really have high hopes going into.

												Lots of fun. Seems like it would be a micromanagement game, but ends up more being about 'look how many things I can put on one thing'. Reasonable difficulty curve later in the game, but the pace is fair. Controlling different types of minion for different jobs is pretty neat, and doesn't get clunky or frustrating. Using left and right click to move an entire unit of minions gets frustrating at times. Moral choices seem out of place a tad, choosing to be either 'evil but fair' or 'total ♥♥♥♥' isn't really satisfying more than just the cosmetic effects of 'my armor is now shiney or spikey' in which case the Raising Hell DLC totally removes for a unique armor set that makes the moral choice entirely pointless for the visual feedback as it stays the way it looks from crafting, rather than evolving to suit your level of evil. That could just be me nitpicking, but whatevs this game is a slam jam outta 10			"

												Holds up surprisingly well, with engaging gameplay including halfway decent, not puzzles exactly, things like puzzles with your minion control (tho one or two frustrating moments) and above-all the humour. The humour is what sells this game.Given that FUN is what many (almost all) consider the point of video games (and that's wrong mind, but irrelevent here), you'd really expect more games to be funny. I really don't get why they're so sparse. Granted, big difference between comedic elements, comic relief, and comedy -- even bigger difference between a comedy and a full-blown . . .giggle-fest? Yeah, giggle-fest. This game is a comedy, through and through -- in an almost classical (Greek) sense actually. Snarky wit, situational juxtaposition, exaggeration, and something that in a twisted way could actually be called romance. Basic RPG elements, and that's all it needed -- it's a nice little adventure. Cheers for a good romp and no few laughs.			"

												This is an amazingly fun game. The graphics are beautiful for its time and it reminds one of Fable when playing. (Though I'm not 100% sure, I believe some of the same voice actors are present in this game)  Basically, you are awakened as the new Overlord and your first priority is to retrieve the 3 lost Minion clans which each have special powers of their own. Browns (Your starters) have all the power. Greens (Your assassins) are a lethal group, though they can't take the hits as much as the browns. Reds ( Can dish out the long distant damage and are great for area advantages such as ledges and whatnot) One hit and they are goners. Lastly, the Blues (Revivers) that's pretty much all they can, oh and they're the only ones who can defeat magical creatures.6 hours in and there is already a mass amount of content. For starters, you can customize your very own tower. Everything from banner colors to so much more. Then there is the arena, in which you and your minion horde takes on foes in which you've already defeated. There is the smelter, in which you make new armour/weapons and upgrade your current armour/weapons as well as your minions attack and defense as well. And also..well so far..that's I'll I've gotten.It's exciting viewing the beautiful scenery as well as the hearing the crude humor which this game offers. It's a great laugh. Though there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of story present, that's not a problem. You are mostly doing random quests and deciding whether or not to grow your corruption level. Killing equals more corruption. Not killing..is pretty much being good. There is quite a bit of strategy involved which is nice. Example, certain trolls will wave their arms before hurdling themselves in the air and doing body slams. Your job is to notice this signal, call your minions back (sparing them such a horrible fate) an finally throwing them back in their after it's landed.

												Great fun! Minnions are so well developed, with personality, wit, and very funny actions. The story is well told but a bit lite. The world is very well designed and allows plenty of adventuring and revisiting areas is even encouraged. The colors and objects are bright and bold. This game takes some tactical strategy to play well. You can fight each encounter in many different styles depending how you mix and match your 4 different minnion types. They four are very different and your decision on how many of each type to travel with changes every encounter. There isn't another game like this ... and that uniqueness really makes this game stand out. The RPG element of improving your armor and weapons also extends to improving your different minnions and your own magic spells. I played for hours just because it was so much fun. I never felt compelled to advance the story any faster than I felt like going. The replay value of this game is very high. Even when you know all the plot points that will advance the story there is still some much variety that you can try to complete area's time and again with different mixes of minions and new tactics. I was very surprised at the quality and pure fun of this game.   This game is a 9 out of 10. Very fun, very replayable, very enjoyable ... when your brown minnion returns with a pumpkin on it's head as a helmet ... what's not to like?			"

Well, you could nitpit and say that there's no minimap, plus the tutorialization is broken in a couple of key places (how to sweep and how to use guard markers). And there's no Run speed, so you're going to be doing a lot of trogging around. But your minions are SO MUCH FUN. You won't feel so much evil as much-loved in this game. Your minions just adore you, bringing you stuff and eagerly praising you in every way. Plenty of lovely details, plus some gorgeous worlds, make this a game I found well worth playing.			"

												Overlord is certainly worth playing. It has good gamplay and a nice chunk of humour. Keep in mind though that there is no serious plot in it, as it relies on its humour. In the game you control minions along with the main character, which is, the Overlord. The Overlord is fairly squishy alone, but is capable of doing decent damage. This is where the minions come handy. They can overwhelm opponents with their numbers, leaving the Overlord out of harms way. There are four types of minions. Brown, Red, Green and Blue. Every type has their own special abilities and uses. Brown minions lack a special quality, but are the thoughest in a fight. Reds throw fireballs, are immune to fire and can extinguish fires blocking your way. Greens are immune to poison and can remove toxic fumes. Blues can go into water without drowning. Then there is your tower. In the tower you can forge armor and weapons for the Overlord to use, customize its looks and you can even get a mistress there. Yay. There is also a teleporter, which you can use to get to places you have visited previously.The music in this game fits it very well. The soundtrack is not awesome, but as stated, it fits the games setting and helps set up the atmosphere. Visuals are nice for such a old game. The animations looked a bit awkward in certain situations, but it kind of just adds to the humour. One might even think that they were made awkward on purpose. Heh.Overall this game has a lot of good points and a very few bad ones. The controls for the gamepad did feel a bit ""iffy"", so I'd recommend using a keyboard and a mouse. If I had to name to biggest issue I have with the game, I'd have to say it's the fact that you can't save manually. Anywho, this game is definetly worth picking up if you're looking for a humorous and lighthearted RPG.			"

												OverlordWhen this game was released back in 2007 and me and my friends popped into the pc, we went like ""wow that looks good""4 years later... it still looks really good!Imagine a fantasy world, with dwarfs, elfes, halflings humans etc.Its a perfect little world, but every world needs its balance.Thats where you come in, Evil recarnated, you are the new OVERLORD.Subdue the mindless mortals to your will, make them fear you or love you, as long as they worship you.Follow a questline that requires you to hunt down and deal with the group of heroes that defeated the last Overlord before you.The game has a great world design, and really sets the mood, also the story line fits right with the theme, and the choices you make influence the outcome.Choose to be good or evil, command an army of minions, at the end of the game you will be sad its over.I played this game countless time and im still not tired of it! 10/10			"

												I was about to write a negative review on this game. Do NOT try to play this game using keyboard and mouse. It's a completely different game, believe me. Using the gamepad right stick is the big deal.Several negative reviews complain about clunky or ""bad ported"" controls but they don't explain why. KB+M felt like they were ""ok"", but this game was just not designed for them. Get yourself a dual stick gamepad and see it for yourself.I hate the default camera angle, with the overlord so close. Toggling it to the alternative view improves gameplay a lot.			"

												I picked this up in the Humble Bundle which I suggest you do the same before time runs out. I chose to pay $10USD for this & 5 other games +Overlord DLC.I've only spend 1.5 hrs in the game but so far I am pleased with it. It's sort of like pikmin in the fact that you control minions to do your dirty work & fight for you. Though you're an evil overlord, I dont feel as if im that evil. I do task for good people and am warned not to kill innocents cause it comes at the cost of not having followers. Then the enemies look as evil as me. It's still a fun, time killing game & worth the price. I don't like how there is no map to point you in the direction of your objects or at least get a lay out of the world, though the worlds are designed pretty good so you won't get too lost.			"

												An  entertaining cross between Lord of the rings/dungeons and dragons and Pikmin! Although most of the things in game can and should be done by your disposable and often easily replaceable minions, you can step in and get involved in the battles directly. Different colour minions have different strengths, weaknesses and abilities that should be used to tip the tides in your favour. Although it shows it's age in places it still looks good and the sounds and music are suitable. Some of the voice acting could have been done better and possibly more varied within a species.The controls benefit greatly from the use of a game pad, and the game has very good support needing a keyboard for first time setup and player profile creation only.The game has a known bug that causes errors on launch if you own but have not downloaded the 'Raising Hell' expansion.Overall this is a game that you find in the 'bargain bin' but soon discover it's simple yet devious play style getting you gripped for hours.

												Overlord is really fun. If you have ever enjoyed playing a pet master class in an MMO, you owe it to yourself to try this one out.Warning! The Raising Hell expansion adds a lot more content, including a ton of really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and frustrating puzzles where you spend more time fighting with the interface than actually playing the game. You will end up looking up the solutions on the internet just to see how to make your minions do what you want. It's ""get sword"" ""I don't see a sword here"" all over again. Which all leads up to the final boss, which is an absolute triumph of tedious design.But the main game is great! Buy Overlord, avoid the expansion.			"

												Overlord is a dark game with dark humor. You can control minions (Which are hilarious) to do evil stuff, drown, die, kill sheep etc... It is kinda an open world game, where you have to explore to find objectives but the world is small with 'checkpoints'. I recommend it as it is fairly tough and is money well spent.			"

												A game where you get to control a super-villain whose only goal is to control the entire world, either with total dominion in mind or to bend the entire world beneath your iron grip. You have a plethora of minions that serve and do your bidding, and overall, I don't have ANY complaints about this game other than the odd glitch where your minion gets permanently stuck somewhere and you're stuck without them until you exit the area and come back in or go to a new zone.Combat is primarily focused on you controlling your minions as you don't really have much in the way of fending off enemies aside from swinging your weapon or casting the odd spell at them. The boss battles are actually pretty good, though my favorite one has to be the first boss because I love dodging around him and then siccing the minions onto his butt and watching them climb all over him and beat on him until he shakes them off. Oh, did you know your minions can jump onto enemies and beat them senseless too? Vicious little things.All in all, I heavily recommend this game for anyone looking to get into the Overlord series. For me, this game will always be a 10 out of 10, the only game that beats it in pure evil mastermindery is Dungeon Keeper.			"

												This game is fantastic. It is packed with some decently dark and impish humour, the setting is glorious and the gameplay is fun and addicting. Unlike other games, which put you in place of the hero, you deliberately play a villain in this one. Why is that so important? Because this game lets you play this role any way you like. Keep the civilians alive and you get access to certain areas and some upgrades, kill them off and you get corrupt, causing you to become stronger yourself. Every choice you make has an impact on the game world, and this game knows how to make you feel that it actually had an impact.The gameplay needs some minor tweaking on the minions' AI, but else it plays well, even with the Keyboard and Mouse. The controls are complex, yet easy to learn, and it has a significant level of challenge at some points in the game.The graphics still hold up today, which is a hard thing for a game from 8 years ago. And best of all: You can even kick your own minions around if you feel like beating someone's face without killing anyone.- - - - - - - - - -Gameplay: 8/10Controls: 8/10Difficulty: 7/10Graphics: 9/10Addictive: Definitely, it's so much fun to play- - - - - - - - - -Worth buying: Of course. Just the minion-kicking is worth the money alreadySo what are you waiting for?

												You play as an evil minion overlord.To be completely honest the story to the game isn't very good.The gameplay of this game is great. You have a team of minions to control. Sometimes they are used to do puzzles but are mostly for fighting. You can use them to distract all of the other enemies so you can pick the off one at a time, you can use your minions to kill the enemy before it gets to you at all, or you can just attack with no strategy at all. The voice acting for the humans is terrible, but it's good for the minions. Part of this reason is because it's an older game. Overall it's a good game. 6.5/10!			"

												Not bad for a game made almost 10 years ago. I've seen this game pop up in my suggestions list several times, but never really gave it a second look until a rainy day at home a few days ago. The overall premise is different, placing you as the tyrannical dictator who is happy to sacrifice your minions to get upgrades to your armor, destroy your enemies or just for laughs. As you complete quests you unlock different types of minions who carry out your bidding on the battle field, and also restore your looted and dilapidated castle to its former glory. You are encouraged to be evil, which is a nice change of pace from the games that give the tired option of choosing good over bad (i.e. Fable, KOTOR, etc). Sometimes, it’s nice to have a linear story line that takes you down a specific path to show you something fun.The game play is addicting, though a little buggy when trying to control your horde, and the control mapping wasn't ported very well to my Mac (namely the function keys which have operations assigned to them through mac os). But you can map the controls yourself and find a way to play the game that works best for you. The game also crashes periodically for unknown reasons, but I'm sure an update will fix that in the near future.For the price, Overlord is worth your time.			"

												So far I'm enjoying the game. Very fun and humorous. However, the game-play is incredibly clunky and annoying.The whole game mechanic is a nuisance! controls and game mechanics are awkward and annoying. If you wan to heal, you'd have to find a specific statue that's used to sacrifice minions in order to gain health. The same thing goes for raising your mana. This task can be awfully annoying when you're being chased by enemies, have have one minion left, and you're running low on health. It's honestly mixed emotions for me.  Like, why couldn't they just have health and mana potions? It drives me freaking nuts!!! I technically have 7 hours into the game. A friend gifted it to me, which too came with the DLC; (Overlord: Raising Hell), oddly enough it comes as a whole standalone game... Meaning if you lunch the original game it'll exe the dlc game instead. Hence why it shows my played time as 0.4 hrs. Anyway, I seriously don't know why they can't just get the DLC launched with the main game?! What's so hard about that? Something else that really bothers me is the map-level design. Like I mentioned the controls are clunky and annoying, and maybe it's a me thing, but I find my self absolutely lost and confused on what to do next in some levels. And I kid you not, I literally look at every edges of the map just to try and find a clue on what to do. The game is just poorly made. The awkward camera disorients the hell out of me therefore makes it hard to have real perspective of the game's level. Again, this could just be a me thing. But my point stands the game plays like crap. After all I said, I still get called back into it. The game has interesting chemistry, the visual arts remind me of Fable 2, the music is great. Maybe one of the best I've heard in games.(Here's a playlist of the game's soundtrack on YouTube)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3o2Xr3Jp34&list=PL8E804F42C3BB9E24) The game is simple, it doesn't ask much of you. You're just some big bad-♥♥♥ dude with a big ♥♥♥ axe that commands funny little minions dudes to your bidding. If that isn't good enough you have 11 unique domains to explore (6 with main game and 5 with DLC). And you can be A. A good guy that helps the weak in help or B. Be a cruel jerk and off them and keep everything to yourself. If you appreciate a game with nice visual arts, great music and incredibly annoying game-play mechanics and control maybe this game is for you? I'm not sure what this is, I don't think it's a review. I think a honest review is of someone giving unbiased statements and facts about said subject. There is a bit of biasm here. But whatever, if you like what you read watch a few game play videos and then buy the game. It's only $5 and you could also refund it in time. Just thought I'd share my thoughts.			"

												Ah, this is one of my favorite game next to Dungeon Keeper (there really needs to be sequel). You awaken out of a special tomb, brought back to life by the adorable yet deadly minions you will soon command. One unique Minion, Gnarl, helps guide you through your rise to power, as you take over the nearby peacefull village and make your own decision as to wether you will be a gentle master, or a dominating overlord that leaves a swatch of destruction behind. Your corruption is measured as you progress, and retrieve the hives of your various minions. Learn to use each to maximum effectiveness and outfit your hoarde with a number of each. Will you take over the entire kingdom? Upgrade your amor, and weapons, or look for special objects that increase your health, mana, or hoarde size. Lots to explore and do allover the kingdom, and it's all yours. Once you take it, that is.			"

												A mix of action and strategy, where you play the titular overlord and command a group of minions to do your bidding. Although fun and engaging, and offering an interesting art design, the story is lacking, but at least it's humorous. If you ever played Pikmin, this game plays in a very similar fashion, but is not cutesey, which I find to be a big plus. Overall, I had a lot of fun playing, the biggest drawback to me is a lack of replayability. You have a few choices to make in the game, and they do affect the game to some degree, but they're pretty superficial, and did not make me want to see what happens if I choose differently too much. Despite all that, the game has a certain charm to it that made me love the game despite it's shortcomings. Also, of all the games which have a villain protagonist this is the best one of the bunch, maybe the sequel is even better, but I have yet to play it.			"

												Best Pikmin clone i've ever playedBasically if you like Pikmin you'll like this. It does have some improvments mechanically over Pikmin; notably the Minions can safely find their way back to you from anywhere in your zone. By safely I mean they will not run into poison, water, or fire if it would kill them, I do believe however that if say you have some browns and some greens trying to get back to you, the greens will follow the brown's path avoiding the poison instead of just going through it. The story is also funny, in a dark sort of way. Only has about two playthroughs in it, one corrupt and one not.			"

												Good game and it has good a story line. The A.I is not too slow but at times combat is good and full of action easy to learn it's full of good humor.  The only bad thing I have to say is that their is no map so you will get lost at times , also the area looks ugly at times. Some of the voices can be bad but their are some good ones that make up for it. Other then that it is worth the money.

The minions can be very stupid at times.2. Wonky controls and camera3.When all your minions die, you are very powerless, and it takes forever to get more minionsThis game is not for everyone, but if you're a fan of RPG games that allow you to control companions to defeat enemies, then this is the game for you.

You lead an army of little Gremlin-like ""minions"" (if Gremlins drank energy drinks) on a quest to set Humanity free from fat, glutonous Halflings (only you have the right to terrorize and rob Humans), pansy Elven whiners and drunk and greedy Dwarves. Your army is adorable in their lust for chaos and mayhem, and the desire to please their ""Master"".

												This game has everything i loved about Dungeon Keeper, except rather than possessing a minion im just an evil dungeon overlord with a choice of feindish weapons, magic and an army of imps to do my despicable bidding.Manage your minions with a combination of squad-command styled combat and third person action, that plays decently for a game that i suspect was a console - > pc port, albiet that the controls can be clumsy at times though, so consider yourself warned.Gather gold, unlock more minions and raise your hellish army of, i daresay for evil ... some of the little buggers are amusingly cute... and rebuild your lair while you raid and pillage the outlying towns, showing no mercy to all those in your way.Id recommend the game just for the dark humor honestly and the fact that for once, you get to play evil, but those are also somethings that i loved from Bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper series - but this isnt about DK, this is about a rather enjoyable melee/squad/3rd person action game called Overlord!

												Overlord is a game I want to like but that I fail to. The premise is sound: you are an evil Overlord who commands an army of minions and seeks to do evil deeds across an otherwise rather peaceful land. Which could be fun, if the game didn't get in the way. To rebind the keyboard controls you have to open up a seperate configuration window that has drop-down menus as opposed to the standard 'click-and-select' method most games use. On top of that the key-binds only appear to take some of the time. Now if you're like me and own a controller you might think yourself smart in using it, except that the controller controls are just as bad. The right-analog stick doesn't turn the camera and thus you're left to the mercy of when the game deicides you need to turn. The minion controls work reasonably well but I found it very removed and it felt more like an RTS with a third-person camera. The game is awfully vague at times as well and you'll find yourself without an idea of what you're supposed to be doing, how to go about doing it or what your overall goal is.			"

												For a fan of any game; with it's dark humour, reasonable storyline and tactical combat, there's everything you could hope to find in a game. Truly, one of the greatest ever. It is fun, unique, creative and certainly makes you aware of what you're doing - you feel like you're in control of the game, everything comes down to what you decide to do. All in all, thoroughly enjoyed each and every aspect of the game, it is excellent! The Raising Hell expansion adds even greater things. For what I paid for it, it was almost like robbery: no more than £3.50 for the entire collection of the Overlord series, a huge steal. One of my all time favourites.			"

												I personally enjoy games that allow you to play an evil character. Overlord does just this, though most of it is out of choice. However, the game has a very noticeable fault. This fault is the controlling of minions: they simply don't work as they should. You'll be frustrated at the inability of minions to protect themselves and to carry out attacks when the enemies start mob actions. Another issue that I have personally had with minion controls, are their ability to not follow your command fast enough and this will cause ALOT of anger. But If you can get over these issues, the game is great.			"

												Overlord is one of those games where its easy to promote to under 16s yet difficult to push towards the older age groups.This jovel offering provides the player with an opportunity to amass and control an army to carryout a set of destructive whims in the rise for total domination. Your afforded 4 types of minions to control independantly or all together, each with the specialised traits along with the opportunity to up your skill level improving all facets from minion to overlord and even includes the chance to decorate ones own evil castle.Sadly as pleasant as it may be it doesnt come without issues like control of minions in certain circumstances, poor camera control, sticking animation and no guide to know where the new areas are.All in all recommended in a sale but really only of interest to the quite young as not challenging near enough i feel to keep most 16s and up engaged what with no skill setting being available.

												One of those games that just lurks there in the back of your mind after you've played through it whispering ""come and play me to relax"" A Classic game with zany little creatures that have you laughing at their antics and what they find to wear during the times they are not getting squashed/drowned/set on fire/chopped up etc. And more just come back as happy as a wino in a wine cellar! Yes I know it's in the programming that they do it - but it's a great game to play just to unwind and have, what we sometimes forget games are for - to have fun! "

												Lots of fun. Seems like it would be a micromanagement game, but ends up more being about 'look how many things I can put on one thing'. Reasonable difficulty curve later in the game, but the pace is fair. Controlling different types of minion for different jobs is pretty neat, and doesn't get clunky or frustrating. Using left and right click to move an entire unit of minions gets frustrating at times. Moral choices seem out of place a tad, choosing to be either 'evil but fair' or 'total ♥♥♥♥' isn't really satisfying more than just the cosmetic effects of 'my armor is now shiney or spikey' in which case the Raising Hell DLC totally removes for a unique armor set that makes the moral choice entirely pointless for the visual feedback as it stays the way it looks from crafting, rather than evolving to suit your level of evil. That could just be me nitpicking, but whatevs this game is a slam jam outta 10			"

												I picked this up in the Humble Bundle which I suggest you do the same before time runs out. I chose to pay $10USD for this & 5 other games +Overlord DLC.I've only spend 1.5 hrs in the game but so far I am pleased with it. It's sort of like pikmin in the fact that you control minions to do your dirty work & fight for you. Though you're an evil overlord, I dont feel as if im that evil. I do task for good people and am warned not to kill innocents cause it comes at the cost of not having followers. Then the enemies look as evil as me. It's still a fun, time killing game & worth the price. I don't like how there is no map to point you in the direction of your objects or at least get a lay out of the world, though the worlds are designed pretty good so you won't get too lost.			"

												8/10This game is very original and extremely funny. I remember playing it with my friend when it first came out. The 75% off deal on Steam was a no brainer for me. My minions are quite an interesting bunch, some of them have actual helmets, but the rest thought that frying pans, a crown, skulls, dead possums or pumpkins would probably give decent head protection. Other than that, the voice over and cut scenes are great.If you want to take a break from being mr. niceguy, and need a good laugh to forget about your day; buy this. Just don't expect this to be a game you will be playing for weeks on end.			"

												Hours of fun.  You play the villain out to conquer various heroes and the Overlord world.  You have four groups of minions at your disposal each with their own unique ability.  The game requires a bit of strategy and puzzle solving, it's not just a brute force type of game, though in certain situations, brute force does work.  Fantasy and dark comedy elements also had to the gameplay.  Great visual colors and a decent story that comes through at the end. Classic game.Final Thoughts:Overlord I is much harder than Overlord II, not sure why.  The minion AI isn't as good as II and sometimes the armored ones will dies because of camera difficulty or they will do something you do not want, which requires constant monitoring of minions during battle. This becomes annoying and time consuming, but that's really my only complaint. The music is surpisingly decent for this game.   9/10  Better on a controller. "

												This game has everything i loved about Dungeon Keeper, except rather than possessing a minion im just an evil dungeon overlord with a choice of feindish weapons, magic and an army of imps to do my despicable bidding.Manage your minions with a combination of squad-command styled combat and third person action, that plays decently for a game that i suspect was a console - > pc port, albiet that the controls can be clumsy at times though, so consider yourself warned.Gather gold, unlock more minions and raise your hellish army of, i daresay for evil ... some of the little buggers are amusingly cute... and rebuild your lair while you raid and pillage the outlying towns, showing no mercy to all those in your way.Id recommend the game just for the dark humor honestly and the fact that for once, you get to play evil, but those are also somethings that i loved from Bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper series - but this isnt about DK, this is about a rather enjoyable melee/squad/3rd person action game called Overlord!

												Overall, Overlord and its expansion provided a fun and memorable gaming experience. It surprised me how a 7 year old game can still offer the same caliber of entertainment that one can expect from current titles. I found the bizzare storyline, comedic fantasy atmosphere, humorous art style, and music to be the most notable aspects of the game. But just like any game, it is not perfect (see my critique below).The Good:- Ridiculously funny story line and art direction- Decent mix of action & strategy- Interesting character & enemy models- A bizzare and outrageous depiction of the ""fantasy"" genreThe Bad:- Some things felt unfinished or lacking- Almost linear story line- A few awkward cinematics- Minions can be a burden to control at times			"

												Now, I was expecting a whole lot from this one, as I can even see that Jim Sterling recommended it. After beating it I can say it's not bad at all. If you liked Fabel, you will love this. You play a rescued Overlord who is made to rule over his minions. The gameplay is alot like a hack and slash RPG meets Strategy. The games currency is split into Gold and Life force. You need lifeforce to spawn minions, so you can expect a bit of grinding....Yeah the game gets that whole ""Third Person action game with RTS elements"" right, unlike Brutal Legends. Controlling minions takes a bit of learning, but once you get the hang of it, it's not bothersome at all.The real joy is the core parts of the game i.e. the minion controlling and puzzling. The remaining parts of the game aren't exciting...I'm talking about the action, story, upgrading and customizing part. The Upgrading and customizing part are More like ""They're there so I'll take it"". The Overlords combat mechanics are silly, but minions make up for it.Lastly, the part about you being Evil. It doesn't get portrayed well. All you feel is Anti-Heroish. It always comes out as you are a jerk who does good and is saving the world.			"

Placed in a Medeval theme with sorcery and whichcraft, is a basic game with not too much advanced skilling going on, perfect from 8 years old... And up! ;)			"

												This game. Aight? THIS game. Lets you become an overlord.I mean sure, it's the only successful Overlord game that CodeMasters made at the time I am writing this review, but this one holds a special place near my heart.So here is my review of the game!-Synopsis-Basically, you play as an amnesiac that has been saved by these little goblins/gremlins/imps/fiends known as 'minions'. ... And no, not the yellow pill/potato shaped guys in the Despicable Me Franchise. Technically, this game came before Despicable Me, so I would like to think that Gru is more ripping off of the Overlord. The guy YOU play as. He is ripping YOU off! ... But anyway...As a result from being saved by them, they expect you to command the horde around for the purposes of killing your foes, breaking objects, stealing valuables, and harvesting resources.Kill your enemies with an axe, the most balanced melee weapon you can wield in the early game, where later, you can upgrade the weapon or get new weapons made from better metals with better smelters you find in your travels. Or alternatively, use your minions to kill your enemies for you. They are the backbone to your evil rule after all! But if you find that your enemies need a more 'personal touch', magic adds a little salt to their injury.-Pros-The gameplay is wonderfully simple, as all you need to do is just be evil! The game even gives you the choice of being merciful or tyrannical. Choosing the corrupted tyrannical path has instant gratification and can get you a lot of resources early. Or you can choose to be merciful. I won't judge you if you would rather save some people and forgo the money. ... But it's still a waste of that money that would be more useful being in your treasury.Simply put, you are the Overlord, and you lay waste to the land on how you see fit.And the DLC known as Raising Hell? A recommendable buy as it adds more items and more places to adventure.-Cons-This game goes far back to the age of 2007, so expect the graphics and animations to be slightly... lackluster. The control scheme on the keyboard feels unwieldy than being on the controller since I can look freely around using the mouse, though using the F1-F12 keys to select spells felt very awkward. This game WAS designed to be played on a controller of course.Then there is the grind for resources. Ooooooh the grinding can take a long time if you don't know what your doing. Even though the resources are easy to get, they usually come in small quantities in most areas, and one would find oneself returning to your tower and then coming back to the land to raid more things. Or simply go to the dungeon and fight enemies in there. Another sad con that I noticed was that there is absolutely no mana regeneration. I mean sure, you can find mana potions in chests and can sacrifice minions to a mana pit to regain mana, or alternatively go back into your dark tower to instantly restore all your health and mana. There is even an armor upgrade that enables you to regenerate your health, but not your mana for some reason. And I do like to cast my most destructive spells sometimes.:3-Rating-I give this game a 4/5, and recommend this game to those who would want to tickle the evil bone in their body someday.(Hell, I even like this game so much that I wrote some fanfiction on it. YES. FANFICTION. I ADMITTED IT.)			"

												I didn't have high hopes for a never-heard-of old game but it's actually rather good.You run around siccing minions on things and occasionally using the (simple) combat system to personally intervene.  If you ever wanted a goblin army to send to pillage The Shire, this is the game for you.			"

												Hours of fun.  You play the villain out to conquer various heroes and the Overlord world.  You have four groups of minions at your disposal each with their own unique ability.  The game requires a bit of strategy and puzzle solving, it's not just a brute force type of game, though in certain situations, brute force does work.  Fantasy and dark comedy elements also had to the gameplay.  Great visual colors and a decent story that comes through at the end. Classic game.Final Thoughts:Overlord I is much harder than Overlord II, not sure why.  The minion AI isn't as good as II and sometimes the armored ones will dies because of camera difficulty or they will do something you do not want, which requires constant monitoring of minions during battle. This becomes annoying and time consuming, but that's really my only complaint. The music is surpisingly decent for this game.   9/10  Better on a controller. "

												This is a funny RPG style game.  It's compared often to Fable because you can choose to be good or evil, however I believe the game is designed to be evil specifically.  I found the game to be challenging and entertaining, played it all the way through at least once.  It is linear so replayability suffers, but it was still a fun game.The controls are fairly easy to use, though sometimes it can be a little frustrating if they don't move exactly right.  There's no micromanaging required, the minions pick up things by themselves and show it off as they run around.  Graphics are good, sound is good.  Tons of sarcasm in this game, which I especially like.			"

												A rather fun hack and slash game with the unusual brand of evil satire. It's always refreshing to play a game where you arn't the 'holier than thou' good guy. It's a decent console port aside from the controls ... just don't try to play it on anything other than a gamepad. Don't get me wrong, it's still playable with the mouse/keyboard, but it is a siginificant handicap. Even if you change the key configuration around, you'll face situations where you'll have to use ~3-5 keys at the same time while moving your mouse.			"

												The game ""Dungeon Keeper"" by Bullfrog Productions changed dungeon crawling into dungeon creating whereby the player was the evil at the heart of the dungeon and the goal was to stop the heroes. ""Overlord"" is another variation of taking the player out of the role of being the hero and into the shoes of the bad guy.  The game parodies the typical heroic RPG and the goal is to conquer the lands surrounding your great evil tower, which you can upgrade using the treasures you collect. Also, there are decorative options to get your tower looking good as well.You can control vast armies of goblins to terrorize the people, collect treasures, and burn villages but to what degree is up to you. The goblins will often make silly comments or jesters while adventuring or pillaging which will make you laugh and chuckle to the very end.There are various options for upgrading your equipment using the forge in the tower while the goblins automatically equip gear found during raids on the villages or you can direct the horde with a mouse click to a stash of gear to which they plunder and equip if possible—I saw one goblin put a pumpkin on its head for a helmet.The controls for the horde of goblins are very simple and easy to navigate. You even have the option of splitting the horde into smaller groups and covering more area. Several puzzles will make for a challenge and require you to adjust the type of goblin in your group like melee, range, or magic in order to move forward.While the main goal is to conquer the lands through ruthlessness or mercy, you also have achievements you can collect and a statistics which shows the amount of total devastation you brought upon the people, which encourages replay.I recommend the game if you want an action-adventure and RPG game that is hilariously witty but challenging. I also recommend purchasing the expansion which adds even more entertainment and fun.			"

												Old, sometimes frustrating if you don't know what you are doing but veryfunny if you like some dark humor.Overlord 2 is much better, but this game is a rough gem as far as I'm concerned and a great part one in the series.It still looks quite good and plays well as long as you use a gamepad, preferrably one with the xbox button layout or with a programmable layout so you can match the Minions to the correct buttons on the pad.The minions are a great idea, making for some unique ways of solving the in game quests.They can fight for you, throw levers, get trough narrow gaps to attack an enemy from behind and be used as traps to ambush the enemies you just lured to them with some other minions.If you get adept at controlling them your dark lord will often never need to lift a gauntleted finger to defeat a lot of the foes in the game. And they are just so incredibly enthousiastic at sacrificing themselves for you that you just have to smile (In an evil way of course).You will even use them to create better armor and weapons for your lord by throing them directly in the furnace in your forge.The game world is a nice ""classical fantasy gone wrong"" wher you finally get to play as absolute evil, or just slightly evil if you prefer. Both have their up and down side.True, hearing ""For YOUUUUU!"" a lot can get a bit annoying at times, but that is a common problem with soundbytes in games isn't it.If you can get it with the expansion pack, do so because it contains a few of the most excellent levels in the game and leads to the events of Overlord 2.

												A solid title, well worth your time.  Intuitive control of your minions, a kind of rock-paper-scissors approach to puzzles/enemies, and semi-open ended quests make the game engaging from start to finish. Its main strength is in its presentation. The potshots it takes at fantasy tropes is great, and worth the price of admission. It doesn't take itself too seriously, while at the same time going for that epic sweep. It pulls that off admirably. And for once, it's funner to be evil.  Great stuff.			"

												Man, what to say about this game.I had never heard of it before I bought it. But seeing how it was only a dollar, and has very favorable reviews, I decided to take the plunge and blow my pocket change. Let me tell you, that was the best dollar I ever spent. This game is just amazing, addicting, and hilarious. It is a parody/satire of the traditional RPG genre, and at the same time somewhat of a RTS. Even though the graphics are a little dated, you won't notice once you start smashing villages and goons around with your gremlin army. In most ways it is just a normal RPG, while there is no ""leveling"", there are upgrades to make you more powerful for your armor and your minions, who will be doing mostly ALL of the fighting for you. Infact, your character is really just there to provide support, as the bulk of the combat is mainly just you micro managing your minions and making sure they dont suicide dive a group of goons. But with that being said, the minions are very well polished and dont often do stupid things unless you tell them too. I really am shocked at how well they are programmed, considering this game is almost 8 years old from the writing of this. It really does hold up very well, and as I am sitting here I can't think of one bad thing that bothered me over the course of me playing it. My favorite part though isn't the unique combat system, but the characters and the world in general. The game is just one big parody on almost every typical RPG ever made. This time around, you are the ""anti"" hero, whose sole goal is to be evil. But trust me, the only evil that is being done is too your gut, because I found myself laughing very often at the general silliness of the characters and the narration by Gnarl, your guide of all things evil, and the simpletons who guide your quests- erm sorry your ""evil"" conquests. The whole world is just tongue-in-cheek really, it is just a goofy atmosphere to be in and it is simply marvelous.There really isn't any reason not to buy this game, I can safely say that many people will not have had a previous experience like this before. I sure hadn't and I've been playing RPGs for a very long time and have played QUITE a bit of my fair share of them as well. Even if it's not on sale, I still urge you to take the $5 hit, which is still relatively cheap really for a game of such calliber. I really hate putting numbers on VG reviews, but in this case I will make a rare exception. For the sheer shock of finding such a quality game, and at the price I paid for it. There is only one score I see fit for it.10/10Evil always finds a way ;)			"

												Lots of fun. Seems like it would be a micromanagement game, but ends up more being about 'look how many things I can put on one thing'. Reasonable difficulty curve later in the game, but the pace is fair. Controlling different types of minion for different jobs is pretty neat, and doesn't get clunky or frustrating. Using left and right click to move an entire unit of minions gets frustrating at times. Moral choices seem out of place a tad, choosing to be either 'evil but fair' or 'total ♥♥♥♥' isn't really satisfying more than just the cosmetic effects of 'my armor is now shiney or spikey' in which case the Raising Hell DLC totally removes for a unique armor set that makes the moral choice entirely pointless for the visual feedback as it stays the way it looks from crafting, rather than evolving to suit your level of evil. That could just be me nitpicking, but whatevs this game is a slam jam outta 10			"

												Great fun! Minnions are so well developed, with personality, wit, and very funny actions. The story is well told but a bit lite. The world is very well designed and allows plenty of adventuring and revisiting areas is even encouraged. The colors and objects are bright and bold. This game takes some tactical strategy to play well. You can fight each encounter in many different styles depending how you mix and match your 4 different minnion types. They four are very different and your decision on how many of each type to travel with changes every encounter. There isn't another game like this ... and that uniqueness really makes this game stand out. The RPG element of improving your armor and weapons also extends to improving your different minnions and your own magic spells. I played for hours just because it was so much fun. I never felt compelled to advance the story any faster than I felt like going. The replay value of this game is very high. Even when you know all the plot points that will advance the story there is still some much variety that you can try to complete area's time and again with different mixes of minions and new tactics. I was very surprised at the quality and pure fun of this game.   This game is a 9 out of 10. Very fun, very replayable, very enjoyable ... when your brown minnion returns with a pumpkin on it's head as a helmet ... what's not to like?			"

												Do you ever wanted to be the bad guy? Do you ever admired the Dark Lord, looking badass, destroying world and killing those pesky heroes? Well, then, this game is for you! Without further delay, lets sink into the fantastic (and sarcastic) world of Overlord!The ""bad guy"" game market is severelly limited. Everywhere we are feeded with either Goody McGood heroes, fighting to save the world or with shallow concept of being gray and developing our character the way we want to (shallow being either ♥♥♥♥ing rainbows knight in shining armor or baby killing maniac). You wont see that here. Instead, we are evil from the start. And that's what making this game fun.Gameplay is really basic sadly. We are the Overlord. We need to rebuild empire. But Overlord doesn't just go around killing stuff, oh no. He have his minions for that. So we are running around with bunch of our Imps, killing things, collecting stuff to upgrade our tower and (of course) doing some fairly easy puzzles. The style is kinda like Zelda. We need some item or other thing to advance further, we collect it, defeat the boss with that, go to another area, rince and repeat. Graphics are really beatiful. This game aged well, giving nice vibe even so long after the golden release. Locations are colorful and alive yet distinct, there are things moving everywhere, light effects are well made. The olny thing I can really dissaprove of are the overall sugar-like appearances of every single location, but the game have it's (gigantic dose) of humour, and exaggeration pays a big role in that.Music is on par with graphics. Really exaggerated, yet well made and distinct. Sounds are great. Every single detal from random people dialogs to battle sounds are great. Story is great. We are the Overlord, taking over the world yet again. At our path there will be much obstacles, including corrupted heroes, lack of resources and other natural or unnatural calamities. Narration is smooth and plot twists are well done. We even have the pleasure of having a wife here, and Overlord is not your average multihour RPG.Bad things? Well, for starters all our work is done by minions. I won't say its technically bad, but our Overlord can't do crap. Its kind of stupid, we are the antihero of this world. The other thing, because the game is strongly influenced by Zelda franchise, we can't really talk about open world RPG or exploration all that much. Oh, we can go to the previous locations to loot additional stuff with our new powers (it's unattainable otherwise, the easiest example would be Imp Pillars in the water, we can't get them, until we get Blue Imps), but we need to go from point A to B on a series of semi-linear locations in order to progress with the story. Also our Overlord can't be developed all that much. More minions, stronger armor and weapon and minion types. Sadly that's all. Well, if you we're spending all nights in Dungeon Keeper, this game is for you. It have great sense of humor (and a bit of self awareness), nice graphics, enjoyable and easy gameplay, and, of course, you play as the bad guy. Its a good piece, althou technically not a RPG, and sadly, kind of short. But hey, its Zelda on crack, so it can't be all that bad! I would recommend this game to anyone from new to experienced players. Go! Conquer the world, Overlord!Zawisza out.			"

												Wonderfully fun game, set in a humorous fantasy world where you are the ""bad"" guy. You lead an army of little Gremlin-like ""minions"" (if Gremlins drank energy drinks) on a quest to set Humanity free from fat, glutonous Halflings (only you have the right to terrorize and rob Humans), pansy Elven whiners and drunk and greedy Dwarves. Your army is adorable in their lust for chaos and mayhem, and the desire to please their ""Master"". You can craft and enhance armor and weapons and choose your Mistress - ""good"" (boring) Rose or the ""evil"" (fun) Velvet, and adorn your Fortress appropriately. Guaranteed to at least make you smile, unless you are a rock.			"

												Only just picked this one up, but I wanted to when it came out. Basically, mash Fable with Lord of the Rings and you get Overlord. You play as Overlord (Sauron) as your command your minions (Orcs) to sack and pillage Spree (Bree) and those pesky Halflings (Hobbits). It's a lot of fun.			"

Really awesome game, played it when I was young but never got to finish it, almost 10 years later, it's still a solid and fun RPG mixed with some RTS and some great humor. I absolutely loved it.

												Not bad for a game made almost 10 years ago. I've seen this game pop up in my suggestions list several times, but never really gave it a second look until a rainy day at home a few days ago. The overall premise is different, placing you as the tyrannical dictator who is happy to sacrifice your minions to get upgrades to your armor, destroy your enemies or just for laughs. As you complete quests you unlock different types of minions who carry out your bidding on the battle field, and also restore your looted and dilapidated castle to its former glory. You are encouraged to be evil, which is a nice change of pace from the games that give the tired option of choosing good over bad (i.e. Fable, KOTOR, etc). Sometimes, it’s nice to have a linear story line that takes you down a specific path to show you something fun.The game play is addicting, though a little buggy when trying to control your horde, and the control mapping wasn't ported very well to my Mac (namely the function keys which have operations assigned to them through mac os). But you can map the controls yourself and find a way to play the game that works best for you. The game also crashes periodically for unknown reasons, but I'm sure an update will fix that in the near future.For the price, Overlord is worth your time.			"

												So far I'm enjoying the game. Very fun and humorous. However, the game-play is incredibly clunky and annoying.The whole game mechanic is a nuisance! controls and game mechanics are awkward and annoying. If you wan to heal, you'd have to find a specific statue that's used to sacrifice minions in order to gain health. The same thing goes for raising your mana. This task can be awfully annoying when you're being chased by enemies, have have one minion left, and you're running low on health. It's honestly mixed emotions for me.  Like, why couldn't they just have health and mana potions? It drives me freaking nuts!!! I technically have 7 hours into the game. A friend gifted it to me, which too came with the DLC; (Overlord: Raising Hell), oddly enough it comes as a whole standalone game... Meaning if you lunch the original game it'll exe the dlc game instead. Hence why it shows my played time as 0.4 hrs. Anyway, I seriously don't know why they can't just get the DLC launched with the main game?! What's so hard about that? Something else that really bothers me is the map-level design. Like I mentioned the controls are clunky and annoying, and maybe it's a me thing, but I find my self absolutely lost and confused on what to do next in some levels. And I kid you not, I literally look at every edges of the map just to try and find a clue on what to do. The game is just poorly made. The awkward camera disorients the hell out of me therefore makes it hard to have real perspective of the game's level. Again, this could just be a me thing. But my point stands the game plays like crap. After all I said, I still get called back into it. The game has interesting chemistry, the visual arts remind me of Fable 2, the music is great. Maybe one of the best I've heard in games.(Here's a playlist of the game's soundtrack on YouTube)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3o2Xr3Jp34&list=PL8E804F42C3BB9E24) The game is simple, it doesn't ask much of you. You're just some big bad-♥♥♥ dude with a big ♥♥♥ axe that commands funny little minions dudes to your bidding. If that isn't good enough you have 11 unique domains to explore (6 with main game and 5 with DLC). And you can be A. A good guy that helps the weak in help or B. Be a cruel jerk and off them and keep everything to yourself. If you appreciate a game with nice visual arts, great music and incredibly annoying game-play mechanics and control maybe this game is for you? I'm not sure what this is, I don't think it's a review. I think a honest review is of someone giving unbiased statements and facts about said subject. There is a bit of biasm here. But whatever, if you like what you read watch a few game play videos and then buy the game. It's only $5 and you could also refund it in time. Just thought I'd share my thoughts.			"

Overlord mixes the two in a unique 3rd person psudo puzzle game where you play a fallen, and ricently revived, overlord trying to claim back the lands around him as well as find out what happened to him.

												A pretty nice action-adventure game with a novel concept (at least for me). Surprisingly a little bit non-linear, but the story, while can be funny, is nothing special. A little bit grindy since sometimes you have to farm 'souls' to replenish your minions, and it gets repetitive and boring towards the end (I play this with the expansion).It's obviously a rushed console port: Checkpoint-based auto-save only, and controlling/directing your minions with M&KB feels terrible.

												That was great! Pikmin in the style of Fable plus Dungeon Keeper. What's not to like? Well, you could nitpit and say that there's no minimap, plus the tutorialization is broken in a couple of key places (how to sweep and how to use guard markers). And there's no Run speed, so you're going to be doing a lot of trogging around. But your minions are SO MUCH FUN. You won't feel so much evil as much-loved in this game. Your minions just adore you, bringing you stuff and eagerly praising you in every way. Plenty of lovely details, plus some gorgeous worlds, make this a game I found well worth playing.			"

												A little bit of evil can be just what the world needs every now and again. This game was well constructed, the idea was simple why be the hero when the villan always gets the cool stuff: minions, a castle, babes, and really gnarly armor. I enjoyed playing a light villain myself, somebody who is just better than the heroes.But trust me when that sister of Rose, a Velvet kiss I wouldn't mind having, starts making suggestions all my do-good tendencies felt for naught. I wanted the lady who I just rescued from a succubus-loving, scrawny-legged, pompous-prude (who stopped being a prude only because of the succubus, and really, who could blame him). I wanted the sweet Rose as well. In the end I chose the good girl, but only because I'm told the good girls are freaks in the bed. ;]No matter which you prefer though,  having relations with your enemy's daughter is the best form of evil.

												One of the best games of its kind, and for once you don't play as the chosen young goodie two shoes kid who saves the world in a fantasy setting, but instead play as a mighty evil overlord who's rising to even greater power.The game tasks you to command 4 different kinds of minions who each have different abilities and strengths; browns, reds, greens and blues.Browns are your basic melee soldiers who are pretty tough and can take more beatings than the other species.Reds are your fireballs throwing artillery, and thus die pretty quickly, they also absorb fire.Greens are your assassins, they love to jump onto the enemies and stab them for tons of damage. They aren't as tough as the browns, but they can take more beatings than blues or reds. They also absorb poison.Blues are your healers, they are terrible at fighting and die quickly, but they will resurrect any fallen minions.All in all the game has a lot of interesting creature designs, is pretty funny sometimes, and you can forge sweet new weapons and armor for your overlord.The only downsides is the minions have a tendency to get stuck in the scenery in one small part of the game.My playtime doesn't accurately reflect the time I've spent on this game as I own a physical copy not registered on Steam too.

												It's like Pikmin if Olimar could actually contribute in fights. You're evil, and so are your minions, so you don't feel bad when your minions die, and the gameplay tends more toward the dungeon aspect than the overworld part, with conquest being your main goal and treasure a side bonus, rather than the other way around.Also you have an overlord base and it's amazing.Minions are somehow adorable and hideous at the same time, it's creepy.Controls can be a bit clunky at times, but you only really notice it when your minion squad keeps running into walls when you're trying to make them pick up their weapon bonuses.

												For a fan of any game; with it's dark humour, reasonable storyline and tactical combat, there's everything you could hope to find in a game. Truly, one of the greatest ever. It is fun, unique, creative and certainly makes you aware of what you're doing - you feel like you're in control of the game, everything comes down to what you decide to do. All in all, thoroughly enjoyed each and every aspect of the game, it is excellent! The Raising Hell expansion adds even greater things. For what I paid for it, it was almost like robbery: no more than £3.50 for the entire collection of the Overlord series, a huge steal. One of my all time favourites.			"

												Overlord is one of those games where its easy to promote to under 16s yet difficult to push towards the older age groups.This jovel offering provides the player with an opportunity to amass and control an army to carryout a set of destructive whims in the rise for total domination. Your afforded 4 types of minions to control independantly or all together, each with the specialised traits along with the opportunity to up your skill level improving all facets from minion to overlord and even includes the chance to decorate ones own evil castle.Sadly as pleasant as it may be it doesnt come without issues like control of minions in certain circumstances, poor camera control, sticking animation and no guide to know where the new areas are.All in all recommended in a sale but really only of interest to the quite young as not challenging near enough i feel to keep most 16s and up engaged what with no skill setting being available.

												Always wanted to try this game, but never wanted to invest the money. Got the whole collection for the same price as if I would have rented it for a week on Xbox. +It's fun, for a while+You play as a villain+Some silly bits+you get powers, can make & upgrade armor and weapons, minions can pick up armor & weapons-Graphics are rough, mostly character animations-No checkpoints. If you die in the middle of a level or boss fight, you have to start from the beginning.-Gets to be monotonous-Lots of glitches, minions getting stuck on & in things, objects getting stuck on & in other things, quests not registering, etc.-When most glitches happen, you have to either teleport to your tower & back, then try again or relaunch the game and try again to get it to work properly. The only times I've had to relaunch was from a boss glitching into a wall and my minions couldn't pick up a quest item, even after teleporting back & forth a few times.-Camera angle can be a painOverall, I'd recommend it if you get it on sale for cheap			"

												I personally enjoy games that allow you to play an evil character. Overlord does just this, though most of it is out of choice. However, the game has a very noticeable fault. This fault is the controlling of minions: they simply don't work as they should. You'll be frustrated at the inability of minions to protect themselves and to carry out attacks when the enemies start mob actions. Another issue that I have personally had with minion controls, are their ability to not follow your command fast enough and this will cause ALOT of anger. But If you can get over these issues, the game is great.			"

												Decent gameI played over 6 hours I think, idk why it hasn't countedPros:- Metroidish elements- Watching your minions tear apart your enemies is really fun- After some point you can buy new gear and can sacrifice your minions to improve your gearCons:- You are nothing without your minions on all aspects. The combat aspect may change after you get better gear but hasn't changed for me in first 6 hours- If you are like me you will get lost A LOT. Game is somewhat large and there is no map and you may be trying to do a quest you can't do yet because you didn't do something yet, I ended up checking a guide numerous times to find out that I'm supposed to be doing another quest- Fighting enemies yourself isn't fun			"

												Overlord is the third game in the Dungeon Keeper trilogy. After conquering the underground of Eversmile, the dark conqueror decides to take his reign once step further, to the overworld. Armed with minions of different flavors, the Overlord must stop the fat hobbit to ensure the world is engulfed in shadow. Often called Pikmin in Hell, Overlord lets you control one powerful dark lord of the Sith. With War's Gauntlet, Melkor can call upon his minions to do mischevious deeds, like drinking beer, breaking stuff, killing sheep, killing peasants, throwing fire at people, reviving their own kind and even peeing. The main draw to this game is hats. As you kill different bosses, your minions can obtain a special weapon or hat based on the enemy you killed. It doesn't matter though because those minions will probably die later on anyway and you'll lose your ♥♥♥♥.Overlord is a cruel and demeaning game. I rate it one scythe out of death.			"

												It's just a couple bucks on a sale, why not? Was a bit fresh in it's time, and may STILL be better than most modern games today. It's a pretty decent third-person RTS game. Gamepad is an absolute.They call this the ""Sauron Simulator"" for good reason, yet you don't have to go that way. There was no penalty for not going full good/evil, just a sequence of yes/no's that affected your gameplay and decided your ending cutscenes. Story blew me completely away that I had to wiki it after.There is a cute and dark humour style closely resembling the first Fable game.I'm not surprised there is a cult fandom because they emerge around games, (warts and all.) The goblins are adorable, yet your only incentive to preserve them is to sacrifice them for better armor/weapon enchantments. It's so weird that so many fans of this game would get so attached to their digital r-♥♥♥♥♥ that the function of specifically tagging and bringing them to life was made available in Overlord 2.			"

												Hmmmm... I was rather sceptical when I watched the trailer, but intriqued because I love playing the bad guy (remember Dungeon Keeper??). My first thought was, oh my ... Quick action and quick graphics all the time (which isn´t me realy), whatever.. I thought I should give it a chance cause it was pn discount. So far i´ve been through some sort of tutorial of the game, and at the moment I´m already wrecking havon on a halflife village. I then, I have to be honest with a review right??... Ok here goes, if you walk around the game with the left mouse button pushed down.. you could probely complete  the game :) ... Im serious, all you in this game is A : walk around and B: Press that mousebutton.. Who would have thought, that destroying a whole halflife village could be soooo boring?!!! .. And the game, is linear in the bad way.. It´s supposed 2 look like and act like a ""everexpanding "" piece of ♥♥♥♥ like Fable but hey... It´s just warm air (If you know that slang) .. After I destroyed lots of halflings I said 2 myself, this is probely going 2 be the same all the way through!! ... Everything in this game mooves soo quickly, that you don´t seem to enjoy it at all.

												This is a funny RPG style game.  It's compared often to Fable because you can choose to be good or evil, however I believe the game is designed to be evil specifically.  I found the game to be challenging and entertaining, played it all the way through at least once.  It is linear so replayability suffers, but it was still a fun game.The controls are fairly easy to use, though sometimes it can be a little frustrating if they don't move exactly right.  There's no micromanaging required, the minions pick up things by themselves and show it off as they run around.  Graphics are good, sound is good.

												Overlord is one of the best games I've ever played! The game is so fun because not only do you feel powerful. but you feel unstoppable! The game has tons of quests! It took me five hours to complete all the quests in  the first area. You can choose to be an evil force to be reckoned or a heroic force to be reckoned with. You can even customize your tower! How freaking cool is that! It's a pretty funny game as well. You can beat the crap out of your court jester, feed your minions and watch them pee after they finish their food and drink, slaughter hobbit-like creatures called halflings and their morbily obese king, and a whole lot more. The game is kind of linear but the areas are pretty big. I say they're linear because usually the way of traveling around are pathways that connect in someway.  Still it doesn't bother me because there is a lot to explore. Now, about forging. Whenever you forge and item whether it be weapons or armor, you have to use minions to do so. The more minions you use the more powerful the item you are making or upgrading will become.Minions come in four types. Brown, red, green, and blue. Brown are your standard minions. They are just mainly used for fighting. Red are invunrable to fire. Green are invunrable to poisonous fumes, and blue can enter water. I highly recommend this game!			"

By safely I mean they will not run into poison, water, or fire if it would kill them, I do believe however that if say you have some browns and some greens trying to get back to you, the greens will follow the brown's path avoiding the poison instead of just going through it. The story is also funny, in a dark sort of way. Only has about two playthroughs in it, one corrupt and one not.			"

												This is a funny RPG style game.  It's compared often to Fable because you can choose to be good or evil, however I believe the game is designed to be evil specifically.  I found the game to be challenging and entertaining, played it all the way through at least once.  It is linear so replayability suffers, but it was still a fun game.The controls are fairly easy to use, though sometimes it can be a little frustrating if they don't move exactly right.  There's no micromanaging required, the minions pick up things by themselves and show it off as they run around.  Graphics are good, sound is good.  Tons of sarcasm in this game, which I especially like.			"

												I've been missing the fun of this game for quite a while now and was very excited to see it was on steam for nearly $4. I recommend using an xbox-like controller with usb when playing this, as the minion mechanics aren't as easy to maneuver with mouse(although it seems fairly simple to call back and send once used to it). The story line is not that dynamic imo, however I still enjoy the overall gameplay and combat style, just slinging minions to your victims and watching then suffer in pain. I'd give this a solid 8/10 and definitely recommend it if you're looking for a chill action-adventure or RPG game :).			"

												I loved this series. The two games had shown me a fun and interesting time, one that's not been presented to me in the past as well since games like Pikmin. I really love the combat, and as stale as it is with the Overlord himself, it's really satisfying taking down something twice, even three times the size of you, and with such variety, I hope they make a third one.

												Overlord is great. You get to be the bad guy which is always fun, ALWAYS. you can be a caring resposible overlord(yawn) if you really want to or you can bring havoc to the lands and kill all who oppose you, which is much more fun. Sometimes the game reminds me of the lord of the rings trillogy as halflings live in little grass covered houses and the Overlords armour kind of resembles sauron's. its funny how your minions run around for you and destroy everything in their way, even though the minion controls can be a bit buggy at times. Im not that far i only have 3 hours play time and a rough guess would be 25% complete but still a lot of game left. it doesn't have free-roam as such but you can go where ever you like in set areas and levels (which could be considered free roam) and you can travel back and forth to each level once you have been there. You can take the game as slow as you want exploring every room and this is quite often nessesary to find pieces of levers and such. If you want to just speed run through the game the easy mode will let you run through levels with small resistance. So far there hasn't been a lot of story and cut scenes past the opening sequence but that can appeals to some players. Please remember I am not far through the game, things may differ further through so take that into account is you have any problems with this review. Overall overlord is a good game with reasonable graphics for its time. It is 6 years old so some mechanics may be a bit outdated but I haven't encounter any major problems or bugs. This game should run on most systems and is a good buy for all fantasy RPG fans. I would rate this game a 7 with minion controls and some long loading screens being the biggest downfalls but reviewing this in 2015 has obviously impacted the score as games have advanced but this came from an era with still some of the most talked about games to date like skyrim and fallout 3. I'm sure if I was reviewing this when it was released it would have scored a bit higher but as games advanced standards get higher. Overlord is definitely worth picking up and I believe it hasn't had the recognition it deserves but who would play the game properly anyway when you can just kick your court jester around the throne room.

Some of the voices can be bad but their are some good ones that make up for it. Other then that it is worth the money.

												I dont often review games. But Overlord blew me away. I loved the minions serving a role key to winning, and the upgrades possible to your castle. The enemy variety was great, and the bosses were excellent. Honestly, Overlord was the most fun game I have played in awhile. I highly recommend it to those who like a game with fair graphics, great quests, adventure, (playing as the bad guy), getting rich, puzzles, etc. If Overlord is ever on sale, pick it up. Best $5 Ive spent on a game.			"

												Fantastic game, no bugs or glitches.  Plays well.  Good plot and story.Only aside is that once you get the 2nd set of armour and upgrade it a fair bit, the game gets very easy.  Your minions become nothing more than cannon fodder serving no purpose other than to move the bits in the game that your character can't otherwise interact with.Put health regen on your armour.  Put base damage upgrades on your sword.  Watch easy mode ensue.Easy aside, great fun game.  Highly recommend, specially at current price points of 5ish dollars.			"

												Overlord is one of those games that certainly changes the way you look at how to approach a game. Overlord is what happens when you mix a third person slasher with a very light resource based RTS. Your primary striking force for the vast majority of the game is your minions, and you can spawn increasing amounts as you become more powerful. Each type of minion has different abilities and strengths, and utilizing them correctly can be the difference in total victory or total annhilation.There really isnt much to complain about when taking into consideration the age of the game. Released in 2007, it actually plays pretty well for a game nearly a decade old. Because of its age, the graphics suffer a bit, and there are only 2 movement speeds: walk and walk faster. Something else that could have helped, but wasn't really necessary was the inclusion of a map. Other than that, my only quip is that once you get the hang of how to play the game properly...it becomes very easy.			"

												Fantastic game, no bugs or glitches.  Plays well.  Good plot and story.Only aside is that once you get the 2nd set of armour and upgrade it a fair bit, the game gets very easy.  Your minions become nothing more than cannon fodder serving no purpose other than to move the bits in the game that your character can't otherwise interact with.Put health regen on your armour.  Put base damage upgrades on your sword.  Watch easy mode ensue.Easy aside, great fun game.  Highly recommend, specially at current price points of 5ish dollars.			"

												""For the Overlorrrd!""This game is an absolute gem. A game where you take on the role of an evil overlord commanding a group of less-than-civil goblins, this game combines interesting story, solid gameplay, and strategy with a taste of laughing gas. It's hard to take anything seriously in this game when your goblin minions are more intent on being silly and disruptive than killing (unless you command them, of course-they always listen to their eeevil Overlord), especially when there's an entire mechanic around booting your minions to the ground. Seriously, those goblins are so adorable, it's actually heartbreaking when one that's been with you on many adventures falls dead. Which happens often.This really is a feel-good game. It's always good for a laugh and brightening your day... although it may be a bit rough jumping back into the middle of it if you take a long hiatus.			"

												One of the best games of its kind, and for once you don't play as the chosen young goodie two shoes kid who saves the world in a fantasy setting, but instead play as a mighty evil overlord who's rising to even greater power.The game tasks you to command 4 different kinds of minions who each have different abilities and strengths; browns, reds, greens and blues.Browns are your basic melee soldiers who are pretty tough and can take more beatings than the other species.Reds are your fireballs throwing artillery, and thus die pretty quickly, they also absorb fire.Greens are your assassins, they love to jump onto the enemies and stab them for tons of damage. They aren't as tough as the browns, but they can take more beatings than blues or reds. They also absorb poison.Blues are your healers, they are terrible at fighting and die quickly, but they will resurrect any fallen minions.All in all the game has a lot of interesting creature designs, is pretty funny sometimes, and you can forge sweet new weapons and armor for your overlord.The only downsides is the minions have a tendency to get stuck in the scenery in one small part of the game.My playtime doesn't accurately reflect the time I've spent on this game as I own a physical copy not registered on Steam too.

												A little bit of evil can be just what the world needs every now and again. This game was well constructed, the idea was simple why be the hero when the villan always gets the cool stuff: minions, a castle, babes, and really gnarly armor. I enjoyed playing a light villain myself, somebody who is just better than the heroes.But trust me when that sister of Rose, a Velvet kiss I wouldn't mind having, starts making suggestions all my do-good tendencies felt for naught. I wanted the lady who I just rescued from a succubus-loving, scrawny-legged, pompous-prude (who stopped being a prude only because of the succubus, and really, who could blame him). I wanted the sweet Rose as well. In the end I chose the good girl, but only because I'm told the good girls are freaks in the bed. ;]No matter which you prefer though,  having relations with your enemy's daughter is the best form of evil.

												This is a combined review for the main game AND the Raising hell expansion pack.  Overlord is a great game where you basically play a parody version of Lord of the Rings, where you are an Overlord that looks a lot like Sauron and you have to use your minions, ie orcs/goblins or whatever to go and kill humans, halfflings, dwarves and elves.It's a very clever take on the genre, the humour and story added a great deal to the experience for me.  I wont spoil the story but having played the game through a second time I got all the little bits and pieces of hidden things going on, so it's more in depth than just running around and killing things.The expansion pack blends seemlessly with the game, if you have both DO INSTALL Raising Hell straight away, as you can do the missions from it in amongst the missions from the original game, I highly recommend that.The game mechanic of using your minions to attack your opponents, and pick up power ups etc works well, but sometimes their pathfinding is a bit average.  Overall, very funny and fun, only negatives are your minions not always obeying commands and some of the expansion levels use new mechanics that don't work well at all..(when you have to 'mow the grass' go online to get some hints, it will save you from smashing your computer).Don't let the negatives turn you away though.Original game 9/10Raising Hell 8/10			"

												Pikmin on crack is the simplest way to describe this title. And it mostly lives up to that name, albeit more about killing things than collecting stuff. There are a few areas in the game that appear unfinished or just badly made which make it feel like this first in the rather amusing series wasn't intended to become a series, rather a quick cash in on pikmins popularity, that said it holds its own and will give you a few good hours of gameplay, granted some of that time will be wandering around dumbfounded and unable to find the way forward, a couple area's don't explain very well how to progress but persistence will eventually reward you with progress. I mostly recommend Overlord 1 if you want some small context on the overall story, which to be frank a game about being evil and sending ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ half breeds of pikmin and gremlins doesn't really need explenation or backstory, just ♥♥♥♥ to kill heh.

												Man, what to say about this game.I had never heard of it before I bought it. But seeing how it was only a dollar, and has very favorable reviews, I decided to take the plunge and blow my pocket change. Let me tell you, that was the best dollar I ever spent. This game is just amazing, addicting, and hilarious. It is a parody/satire of the traditional RPG genre, and at the same time somewhat of a RTS. Even though the graphics are a little dated, you won't notice once you start smashing villages and goons around with your gremlin army. In most ways it is just a normal RPG, while there is no ""leveling"", there are upgrades to make you more powerful for your armor and your minions, who will be doing mostly ALL of the fighting for you. Infact, your character is really just there to provide support, as the bulk of the combat is mainly just you micro managing your minions and making sure they dont suicide dive a group of goons. But with that being said, the minions are very well polished and dont often do stupid things unless you tell them too. I really am shocked at how well they are programmed, considering this game is almost 8 years old from the writing of this. It really does hold up very well, and as I am sitting here I can't think of one bad thing that bothered me over the course of me playing it. My favorite part though isn't the unique combat system, but the characters and the world in general. The game is just one big parody on almost every typical RPG ever made. This time around, you are the ""anti"" hero, whose sole goal is to be evil. But trust me, the only evil that is being done is too your gut, because I found myself laughing very often at the general silliness of the characters and the narration by Gnarl, your guide of all things evil, and the simpletons who guide your quests- erm sorry your ""evil"" conquests. The whole world is just tongue-in-cheek really, it is just a goofy atmosphere to be in and it is simply marvelous.There really isn't any reason not to buy this game, I can safely say that many people will not have had a previous experience like this before. I sure hadn't and I've been playing RPGs for a very long time and have played QUITE a bit of my fair share of them as well. Even if it's not on sale, I still urge you to take the $5 hit, which is still relatively cheap really for a game of such calliber. I really hate putting numbers on VG reviews, but in this case I will make a rare exception. For the sheer shock of finding such a quality game, and at the price I paid for it. There is only one score I see fit for it.10/10Evil always finds a way ;)			"

												Hail, Gluttonous Overlard!Overlord, the game where Pikmin meets English Fantasy Humor. Most games build up to you storming the evil Overlord's castle, slaying the wicked terror of the land and saving the day. Overlord starts after all that, with the Minions dragging your carcass out of the crypts, suiting you up and declaring you the new Overlord. Now its up to you to lead the armies of darkness to victory, to reconquer the land and restore your tower to its former glory. Today Spree... tomorrow the world!Mechanically the Overlord games are similar to Pikmin; you're leading a squad of minions, colour coded for your convenience, each with their own abilities and powers. Browns are your basic shock troops, dumb and with no special abilities other than hitting hard and having lots of health. Reds are ranged, Blues heal other minions and Greens are useless. I mean, Greens are for performing stealth attacks, though the number of times you can actually use that without them being slaughtered is fairly low. They're also used for various puzzles: Blues for example can dispell magic, reds cal move through fire barriers and browns... well browns just break things, but it doesn't have to be enemies.Unlike Pikmin however you're not totally useless - you are, after all, Not-Sauron and can get stuck in with your minions, joining in with battles to help deal damage. Its up to you if you're more the commander type who lets his minons do all the work or if you prefer to fight your own battles with the minions providing support. No Overlord worth his salt leaves home without suitably spiky armour, of course, so the game has a weapons and armour crafting mechanic where you can create new items to wield against the forces of good, imbued with the souls of your loyal minions to grant special abilities.Much like their master, minions can be upgraded by looting weapons and armour off of the fallen, making them more powerful and increasing their longevity. However, there are multiple enemies in the game that can and will simply obliterate minions no matter how upgraded they are, and it can be rather frustrating to see a full squad of fully upgraded minions reduced to jam by a falling boulder or a brand new enemy that has an untelegraphed instakill attack. Until Blues are introduced in the mid-late game there's no way to rez fallen minions, so you learn not to get attatched to them and that any upgrades are a temporary bonus rather than something to be reliably counted on, unless you want to be super conservative.The game controls are fairly simple, with having commands for ""attack"" and ""return"" along with ""guard this point"" and even a ""sweep"" mechanic where you control an entire pack of minions moving as an angry mob. The controls are designed with console in mind - the mouse controls for Sweep especially are fairly dire - so make sure to have a controller handy. However, they do the job fairly well, even if the Minions do have slightly suicidal tendencies and will happily run into fire or water if accidentally ordered. Dealing with the stupidity of your underlings is half the challenge, after all.The game's characters are for the most part charming and funny, especially your advisor Gnarl, who never fails to get a chuckle. The writers were clearly aiming for a Pratchett-esque sense of humor - Sir Terry's daughter was the head writer, after all - but it generally falls a little closer to Peter Molyneux's Fable for the most part. Occasionally rather funny, with a few slightly stretched out jokes.The game has a morality mechanic; you can choose to be good, helping the people of the land and winning their trust, or evil - quite ""kick the dog"" evil, in fact - which will make the first hate you, then fear you, then *obey* you. I do enjoy watching the transition between those stages, though if you want to be a good guy (Why did you buy a game called Overlord if you wanted to be the good guy?) you can. This kind of detracts from the game as well, though - rather than being Stalwart Heroes, many of your foes are in fact as unpleasant and evil as you are, and it was a bit of a disappointment that the game didn't let you be a proper marauding villain.There are downsides, of course; towards the middle of the game are a few truly painful levels that will leave you hoping they'd end, and it can be very difficult to farm souls for certain minions - blues in particular are rather difficult to get without resorting to cheese tactics. There will be several points where your minions The end of the game isn't quite as climactic as it could be and overall it could use a little polish, but if you're willing to look past that - and perhaps keep an FAQ handy - you've got an excellent experience waiting for you.Its worth noting that this game did in fact have a sequel: Overlord 2 tightened up the controls a lot and added a few new control mechanics, along with better spells. The Good/Evil morality system gave way to Dominate/Destroy, which i think suited the setting much better, the Level design was generally better, and the graphics and mechanics got an upgrade for the better. The plot was slightly improved, a new Mount mechanic was introduced and your Lair gets an upgrade to be something truly awesome. You can jump straight into Overlord 2, and its generally what i'd advise - but if you want the full experience give Overlord 1 a go and enjoy a good chuckle.Be warned, though; avoid the newer titles after that. They're very much cash-ins that miss the point of the original series...TLDR: The game has its problems, and lets face it, there are quite a few. Slightly frustrating controls and the occasional bad level design can spoil the experience a bit, but overall Overlord is something different and darkly humerous that i'd very much recommend!			"

Best of all, you get to kill ungodly amounts of SHEEP!

												Hours of fun.  You play the villain out to conquer various heroes and the Overlord world.  You have four groups of minions at your disposal each with their own unique ability.  The game requires a bit of strategy and puzzle solving, it's not just a brute force type of game, though in certain situations, brute force does work.  Fantasy and dark comedy elements also had to the gameplay.  Great visual colors and a decent story that comes through at the end. Classic game.Final Thoughts:Overlord I is much harder than Overlord II, not sure why.  The minion AI isn't as good as II and sometimes the armored ones will dies because of camera difficulty or they will do something you do not want, which requires constant monitoring of minions during battle. This becomes annoying and time consuming, but that's really my only complaint. The music is surpisingly decent for this game.   9/10  Better on a controller. "

If you die in the middle of a level or boss fight, you have to start from the beginning.-Gets to be monotonous-Lots of glitches, minions getting stuck on & in things, objects getting stuck on & in other things, quests not registering, etc.-When most glitches happen, you have to either teleport to your tower & back, then try again or relaunch the game and try again to get it to work properly. The only times I've had to relaunch was from a boss glitching into a wall and my minions couldn't pick up a quest item, even after teleporting back & forth a few times.-Camera angle can be a painOverall, I'd recommend it if you get it on sale for cheap			"

												So, the funny thing about Overlord is that originally I never really finished it or saw a need to finish it. The premise is great: play the bad guy, kill the corrupted heroes. It's a pleasure to play overall, but trying to keep your minions alive is a pain and before long I lost my save file to an accidental hard drive failure. I just recently came back to play Overlord after playing Pikmin 2 again and was a little sad that I never really gave it another chance.It's inevitable that I'm going to compare this game to Pikmin so let's get that out of the way right now. This is evil fantasy Pikmin, just with a little more story, morality, and a ♥♥♥♥ton more strategy. You'll be gathering resources to spawn hundreds and hundreds of your four typed expendable minions, using their vast numbers to decimate the enemy, and get large treasures for yourself in a large fantasy world with many different ""hubs"". This is where the simularities end. Unlike Pikmin, Overlord is more forward with the fact that your minons are expendable and are going to die en masse. As you move through the areas, you'll find many opportunities to replenish your dwindling minion supply though you don't always get the choice to what minion types you can replenish. Typically the game will put out brown or red minon pits as to say ""You're going to need tanks and ranged warriors up ahead"" and that's as far as the hints go. From there the game throws everything at you when you least suspect it, decimates your well-equipped army, and forces you to fight your way back to the last pit with the knowledge of what to expect next time you make a run through that area. While losing a few minions isn't a big deal, losing a lot can be more painful, as minion survival and attack power is based on little items they collect as you break things and the spines of your enemies. Meaning a party wipe means that you'll need to grab more equipment or be disappointed in how squishy your new forces are against the incoming threat.I think my favorite part of Overlord however, is just how strategy oriented it is. While your minions are dumb, they're typically not dumb enough to outright kill themselves (typically) or attack things you don't want to attack (typically). Your job is to manage your horde in such a way to best succeed in every situation. I went for the straight in brown rush as browns are the toughest of your minions. But I could have used greens to flank enemies or clusters of reds to pick off enemies as they approached. You're given a lot of tools  to make the best of every situation you're put in no matter your strategy and it was something I truly enjoyed in this game.Last bit which may have been stronger at the time but more meh now, is the corruption mechanic. You can go balls to the wall evil and just destroy everything while taking things for yourself, or you can be pragmatic in your conquering and try to be nice to the locals in exchange for other benefits. Neither option is truly bad, though going 100% corrupt takes a lot of effort and is probably more trouble than it's worth. Each path will lead to different ultimate spells. A completely evil Overlord will get spells that scream ""screw subtlety!"" and promote a chaotic scorched earth playstyle, while a more reserved one will get spells that do a fair bit of damage but not accidentally harm your loyal worshipers in the process.Overall Overlord is a good game, and one I'm glad I gave a second chance in playing as ultimately I enjoyed it more than I did the Pikmin games. Sure those games are cute in their own way, but Overlord's gameplay is a complete improvement, feeling like a more advanced Pikmin (albiet more about fighting recklessly than managing your limited number of troops for long periods). I can easily recommend it for full price since the game's been out for a while and sells for peanuts, but I probably would have recommended it at full price if it wasn't anyways.			"
