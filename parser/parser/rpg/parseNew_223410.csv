												This game, even back in 2010 was severly underdeveloped and not ready for the market. 4 Years ahead - not much has changed, and it still is years of active development away from being a playable experience.As a new player you will be forced into a world which doesn't deliver on the promise - there is no open market, everything is ran inside of the large, and veteran corporations who have more than enogh resources to run for years without any otuside mining help. If you will try to earn some money by running missions, you will be stuck in a loop of 1-3 of them that will repeat themselves over, and over and over. Without slightest bit of variation.The traveling in this game is awful, it is very long, tedious, and will consume vast majority of your gameplay. And on top of that, it doesn't benefit you much to be at this time in front of your screen as speed-ups are rare and sparce, and autipilot tends to use most of them anywa. So most of your experience while trying to play this game will be spend... playing another game, or watching youtube. Or doing any pleasruable activity.So do yourself a favor, spend your money elsewhere, this isn't worth the AA pricetag, especially for such small and undedeveloped game. For gods sake, it also becomes unplayable if you have high-dpi display, since fonts are of fixed size, designed to look good at 1024x768 resolution. And there is no way to supersize them.			"

												I genuinely like this game.  My standards are not your standards.  All I ask is you do your research.  This game does not reveal itself in your first pass.  6000+ hours and I am still learning.BackgroundPerpetuum is an indie, sci-fi, sandbox mmo, with target-to-shoot combat with cover/Line-of-sight obstacles, 3rd person WASD piloting (with auto-pilot outside of combat).  Player-driven market, player-run organizations (corps), open and closed pvp zones to accommodate all play styles, hardcore/casual.  No griefing, no crime/punishment system.DisclaimerThis is not Mechwarrior.  This is not an FPS.  This is not a AAA subscription MMO by a big publisher.  This is an indie developer team, that loves their work, and want to share it with others, and for a very affordable price.  And its Not pay-to-win.I think most negative reviews can be summed up with expectations for a game it clearly wasn't but research was not done.TL;DRDo your research!  There are screenshots and videos on steam to watch.  Check them out!Noteworthy updates since this hit Steam in 2014 Skill progression is Activity AND Time based.  See  patch notes [www.perpetuum-online.com] 11 new bots still being released! See  blog[blog.perpetuum-online.com] Assignment system update:  patch notes[www.perpetuum-online.com]I'd list all these as Pros, in addition to the fact this demonstrates a consistent pace of new content development.Pros Price (cheap, no sub!) Combat system Industry and resource gathering Player-driven market Skill-point system (Time and Activity-based) Gamma (player built bases and terraforming) Risk:reward Details Combat:  All combat involves line of sight or ballistic pathing for weapons to reach their target.  In addition, plant life, buildings, and other obstacles act as cover when this intersects the weapon's path upon firing.  Terrain elevation, slope, and obstacles also can block shots.  Having the high-ground actually matters in this game!  And I've certainly seen it change the tide of a battle, for and against!There are other anti-blob mechanics that are unique to perpetuum.  Interference, and bot explosion damage on death (beta/gamma only).  Resource gathering: Gathering, or the acquisition of raw material, comes in a number of flavours.  Ore mining, liquid mining, plant harvesting, artifact hunting.  This gives indy players a number of different activities with more or less risk:reward and activity:reward.  Liquid ores can be mined mostly afk, but they are cheap as a result.  Rare ores are on beta/gamma but this comes with risk.  Look at guides and videos for more!Industry: Complex, eve like, but the analogy doesn't get you very far.  Research unlocks the ability to prototype, prototypes are made and consumed to make CT's, CT's can be install in a factory and run until its rating decays to 0.  No BPO's, everything is perishable in this process, and that keeps the economy churning.  A high skill investment to do well, but there are many guides on how to get started even as a new player.  For the skill point system, outside of the new change to it, I would say having a cache of 'points' that you can accumulate without limit and invest in skills whenever is a much better system than a training queue or skills that require you to do that same activity to get better at it.  This way skilling is more flexible and gives new players a chance to learn and research it before investing!Cons Dated graphics Inflexible UI Small communityGraphics:  With a custom, homegrown, ""the-way-your-grandma-used-to-make-it"" game engine might be a great experience for a software engineering team, it also means features it doesn't have might be hard to implement and add.  It's something devs have expressed interest in updating, but it falls behind many other things.UI:  The ui is also the artifact of a custom game-engine with a rigidly implemented ui component.  For example, the text size is fixed to pixel size.  This means high res displays might render text too small to read.  I recommend running the game at 1080 even if your rig is capable of higher...Small Community:  Now enter the cyclical argument of ""I won't play a game because no one else plays it"".  This plagues all small MMOs.  The game world is also small, but some people just need numbers before it registers for them.  If this is you: don't bother.  If you look at this as an opportunity however, this world is free to be shaped.  It takes very few to make very big changes.			"

								The good, the bad and the ugly.The good:This game is interesting, and it is ""EVE like"", which might be a reason for some to give it a try, for others to turn away.If you join a corp, and if they back you up from the start, the game might become more interesting for you through participating in organized PvP.There are a lot of different corps in the game, before you join one, read the official forums a bit, to get more informations about them.You can do harvesting, mining and assginments on Alpha 1 and Alpha 2 islands on your own, to get your first own money.The developers team seems to be small, but at least filled with people, that are very dedicated to the game, something that is getting hard to find these days...The bad:It will take you a lot of real time, to get your hands on those Mechs you were allowed to test (there is your carrot...) in the tutorial.You only get EP once every day, and you have to log in every 3 days at least to make sure to get that EP package for every day.Harvesting, mining or assignments is boring work, but will provide you with NIC on your own, to afford your first Mech.Buying a Mech means, getting enough NIC and finding someone that is willing to sell and transport it to your terminal... forget about transporting anything big on your own in the beginning.Your first robots won't be able to transport that much, and depending on from where you have to transport your new items, you might run into trouble along the way and loose your robot and cargo.If your new shiny Mech gets destroyed at some point, doesn't matter if that happens in PvE or PvP, its gone.Some parts of your installed equipment might be recoverable, there will be a can to loot at the spot where you died, but you will only get a few items back, and those have to be repaired, before you can use them on another robot/mech.But if your ending happened during a PvP fight, the ""spoils"" belong to the winner.If you're part of a corp, you might get a replacement for your loss during ""wars"" with other corps.You can of course insure your Mech, but there are costs for that and the outcome wont even cover the NIC you paid for your Mech empty... say thank you to players, that abused the insurance system a while back.About assignments, you can only choose between ""industrial/combat/transport"", but all of them are more or less combat assignments, even those that are marked ""industrial/transport"", there are only a few different assignments, and be prepared to travel slow and far in the beginning to accomplish them.The ugly:Other players won't stopp at using any kind of exploit or bug they can find against you. That is of course something, you might find in any other game, but in a ""full loot"" game, the developers need to keep an very close eye on that.Last but not least,if you want to get the best Mechs with the best equipment, you need a lot of EP, which will take a lot of real time.And even if you take the ""shortcut"" over an EP booster, it will still take you a very long time to reach that goal.Keep all of that in mind before you consider to buy Perpetuum - then why the thump up?I think the game and the developers deserve a shot at this, therefore i supported the game with my purchase and invested a lot of time into it.I would really like to see this game go on and evolve into more, something that is enjoyable for new and vet. players, and for PvE and PvP players alike.But for that to happen, the developers have still a lot of work to do, sandbox or no sandbox, players expect more from games today.Sand alone does not make the box more interesting or fun, you also need varying kinds of things to play with in that box too...In the end, it's your call.

												I won this game through Steam's summer sale (IIRC) where you had to use gems to bet on games and items, so I did not spend the full price on this game.However I believe the current price ($10) is justified for the enjoyment I've gotten out of Perpetuum. I liked it enough to spend $10 on one of the upgrade packs, and I plan on buying the next when I can.I am writing this review from a casual point of view. I play this game with a relaxed mindset so if you're looking for a hardcore gamer, you are reading the wrong review. Here is what I have noticed in my roughly 180 hours so far.RATING: 65/100PROS:Massive open world. I still haven't visited all the sights of Nia.Passive time-based progression. Extension Points (EP) accumulate whether or not you are active. These are used to upgrade your skills, so naturally, the older players will have slight advantages over newer ones.High levels of build customization and specialization. There are tons of items to choose from to fine-tune to your liking.Varying levels of risk and player interaction. You don't have to join a PvP corporation to make a living, but the added risk definetely pays off.Smooth user interface. This might just be me, but the Windows-like menus are really good for managing lots of information at once.Simple gameplay with complex mechanics. Locking on to targets takes just a few clicks, but there are a lot of things to consider when engaging enemies, like what kind of armor they have, distance of their weapons and yours, and several Electronic/Energy-Warfare tactics.Accessible in-depth wiki. Referencing official information does not require alt+tabbing out of the game as the Perpetuum wiki can be accessed with a few clicks while playing, and the information provides a lot of the formulas and intricacies for you, so there is little guesswork involved when optimizing builds.CONS:Dwindling playerbase. While I do enjoy not being blown up in PvP-enabled areas, there aren't a whole lot of people online to begin with. I'm not sure what turned off so many players, but there could definitely be a revival if an effort is made. The servers and mechanics are just fine, all is needed is some better recruitment.Small variety in environments. Compared to how many different items there are in the game, some of the islands feel a tad barren, repetitive, or otherwise monotonous. Considering the amount of time it takes to travel across Nia, some refurbishing would be nice on the eyes. I play on medium quality settings, but the game already sacrifices graphics fidelity for performance of its large world.I have been making a living by simple mining, PvE assignments, and artifact hunting. I shy away from PvP since I don't like the stress involved but the community tends to be nice. Even the few times I have gotten blown up while on Beta islands, my killers were courteous and offered advice on how not to get caught next time, realizing I wasn't a threat to them only afterwards.My rating is subject to change. improving if the developers add more content, rectify some problems, and/or if more players are introduced.

								What’s the story behind Perpetuum?You are a human who is remote controlling a swarm of nanites that have been sent through a microscopic wormhole. The nanite swarm then infect and control the bodies of sentient robotic lifeforms that inhabit the planet of Nia.The human race is now locked in an on going battle not only against the resistant robotic lifeforms, that are fighting to defend their homeworld, but also against each other in an on-going effort to harvest as much energy as possible.Perpetuum does take a few minutes to get to grips with, while it uses the good old WASD controls there are menus and HUD elements that you will need to familiarise yourself with before you dive right in. Bit of a steep learning curve but it makes it worth while learning how to play.The game doesn’t boast the best graphics but it can be rather enjoyable watching a large mech rain hellfire down upon its enemies. The sound and music in the game is very good, the music especially. The game is an MMO for a reason with players being the driving force behind everything. High tech items can only be produced by players and this requires teamwork. Nothing starts a conflict like wanting complete and total domination over the entire game world.			"

												Perpetuum is a game that's like Eve, but with a few tweaks i like. I wont go into much detail, but players have more impact than you'd think. Both new and old players can help any corporation immensely (artifacting, for example, can be done perfectly from the 1st day onwards). If you at least remotely liked eve, you will love this game.If you somehow dont believe me or have doubts, feel free to message me/add me to friend list. Also, if you get into the game and you're lost, you can give the NSE corp (corp is the equivalent of guilds in this game) holler and we'll give you the starter bots and get you a nice newbie environment to play in.P.S.: the devs are really active with the community - big thumbs up.P.P.S.: Perpetuum is currently mixed because of all the idiots that have written a review with less than 1 hour play time!!! Check the negative reviews - a big majority of players have less than 5 hour playtime.			"

												Long time EVE player who took notice over this game due to Steam recommending it after binging hard in New Eden, and reading about how it plays similar to EVE, only with mechs as opposed to space ships. What I found was a playable game, but one that makes EVE the clearer choice for those who can afford the monthly sub.First order of business is that Perptuum is only Early Access as a Steam title. It has existed since late 2010, and as such, will be reviewed fully on the merit of what it has presented to me during my brief playtime, with its four and a half years worth of content.Good + DEV Zoom seems to mingle with the players quite often, both on the forums, as well as ingame. Most games have the developers stay just out of reach of players, but this game always has this one team member accessible for a good portion of the day by day, which I applaud for a show of passion.+ Newbie Island is a thing here in Perp. I'm going to list this also as a con later on, since I feel the training section is a bit mishandled, but they place new accounts in a ""training simulation"" which is basically a confined zone of modest size, where you start with all skills at halfway, and they force you to progress through all manners of content, to allow the player to become familiar with how it works. You can skill up as you wish here, with no harm done to your account once you leave this area, so it allows players a chance to tinker and get a feel of the skill system, as well as how it impacts elements of the gameplay, which I personally feel EVE fails at outside of a cold lockout for new players that join New Eden.+ The game overhauled its mission system to be far more accessible, which as a new player, I found as a great boon. While EVE would try to sugarcoat their quests with flavor text and other vanity, Perp has reworked their system to be more streamlined, allowing players to focus on their personal interests such as mining / combat, go out into the world and accomplish the goal, and return to a mission terminal in record time to collect their reward. Bad- Horrible UI. In EVE, you have your toolbar that you can move around as you wish from side to side, yet in Perp, it is always at the top of the screen. You can move the various HUD elements around as you wish, but you cannot resize beyond certain points. - Unable to change resoulution. Due to some wonky design choices from the dev team, the screensize is either locked to your full resolution, or a screen size befitting 2004. When you go to a larger resolution, it merely pins items spread out, but does not adjust the font sizing on these items, as one of the devs stated in the game that their engine treats the UI as 3D elements or something or the other, and that is why the dev team cannot readily make changes to the endless barrage of players requesting this feature to be overhauled. - Lack of shortcuts. Again with EVE, you have your toolbar and it lists various keyboard shortcuts for you to utilize to access any element, as well as even having the option to close all screen clutter with CTRL + ALT + W. Perp? Next to nothing seems to flow the same as you would expect coming from EVE, and your toolbar does not say what any of these hotkeys are. You have to dig deep into the options to find them on your own accord, and it just should not be this way. Information is ammunition, so having it all readily available at your fingertips is somthing that should have readily been copied from EVE's toolbar, not merely left to an options menu. This style of gameplay is the type where more info = better, and taking excess time to click icons manually or assigning things serves to merely drag the experience onward, instead of propelling the player through aspects of the game.- Training is pretty bad. Compared to EVE's approach of Aura acting as a questline agent to advance you through various elements of training you desire, Perpetuum forces you to advance through all the training before you are allowed into the ""real"" game. On average, this takes about two hours or so for most players advance through, which is both a blessing and a curse. It is a harsh reminder of just how complex EVE and Perp are in their game systems, but EVE allows players the chance to completely skip the training and take a ""feel it out"" approach, while Perp does not allow this freedom. Making an alt to play the game differently? Too bad, hope you like getting stuck doing training. - Overly convoluted gathering system. To gather in EVE, you merely need skill training for the tech, and of course a mining laser / gas harvester. With additional training, you can have mining crystals for certain loadouts to increase your mining yield.Gathering in Perp? Oh boy, you better get ready to yell at how needlessly involved they have crafted it by comparison. First, you need to equip a mining attachment, or a gathering attachment. From there, you need ammo per cycle, and it gets more aggrivating with mining. Gathering has a universal ammo that you can obtain rather cheap, mining is nowhere near as easy on the user.To mine, you need your scanner setup with two ammo types. One is a ""range finder"", the other shows you the density of an area after you've played Marco Polo with the system and wasted enough ammo charges to find the location on the map of where items are set. From here, you need the right mining ammo charges set to mine it. Looking for something low class like Titanium? You need specific Titanium charges to mine it. They can ONLY be used to mine Titanium. This means that if you're not mining for a mission, but rather for yourself, you must waste precious cargo space with various ammo types, which might not be an issue anyways, as you need specific scanner ammos to seek out any mining. In EVE terms, this would mean having to equip a scanner with Veldspar locator ammo to find the location of a belt, then using another type of Veldspar scanner ammo to actually be able to lock onto it, then you need to cycle your ammo if you have not done so to equip Veldspar mining ammo, so you can actually mine it. This is very horrible design in my opinion, and does not add depth to the game, only tedium to an already arguably tedious playstyle.- Launcher is unoptimized garbage. A recent update that overhauled the mission structure was implemented with a 1.6 MB download on Steam for the game, which then led to having to load the Perp launcher and sit through updates. The update was a mere 16.06 MB in size, but it took about 15 minutes for my PC to download it, which I haven't seen done in any MMO since FFXI and its 56kbs speed cap. - Pop is severely low. Usually sub 50 players listed in chat channels, with over 100ish logging in daily to keep their skill points churning in. I see it as each player holding more meaning to the game overall, but others will see this as a dead game walking.- P2W. In EVE, all choices are final with your skills, unless CCP nukes a set somehow. In Perp? You can pay real money to reset points and have them to spend on whatever you want. Recent balance changes before I joined severely nerfed many loadouts for PvP and other aspects of gameplay people spent months or more training into. Solution? Just open your wallet if you want to and get SP back to invest into the new meta, or lament having skills wasted by wanton dev decisions and train normally into the new meta. EVE works it so new can compete with old by specialized training, while Perp lets the old stay on top by wallet or ingame ICE (PLEX) use.All in all, I found Perp as the offbrand cola for my desire for a namebrand fix. Sam's Cola is not quite the same as Pepsi, nor is Perp really EVE, but I found myself enjoying it despite its many shortcomings, and appreciating it for what it offers. I can easily recommend EVE for those seeking quality, but at the same time, Perp exists as a cheap pay to own option to EVE's fees.			"

												Been playing this game since it's release in 2010. This game deserves much more credit and popularity.Pros:Open world PVP with complete safe areas for new player and old alike.Complex resource gathering and mining system 95% of items is player made and can be sold on the market.Become whatever you want ,many options (miner,manufacturer, trader, bounty hunter, market mogul,spy , empire builder and practically whatever you want)Sculpt your world with terraforming and player made structuresNo subcriptions , in game credit is optional but has only slight advantages (well balanced business model)Excelent community and Friendly Dev team that listen to their playerbaseCons:Graphics and GUI are not the best but a new GUI engine is next on the list from developers.Might be slow and complicated to get into at first but community is helpfulMore players to fight/compete is really needed, as this is a team centric game although it is quite possible to go solo.A tad slow and grindy to get into at first, if you have little patience don't bother.This game is an absolute steal even at full price, now it's half that price!

												Great alternative to EVE Online, population is not overcrowded as of yet and input to developers is direct (though requires good arguments for convincing.) Players are able to directly contribute to the game in some ways such as with vector graphics designs for corporation logos, tool creation, and other ways. Currently the game needs more players in order to increase the balance of powers, which isn't too hard to do with diligance. The game does suffer from lag due to some datacenter issues that are being worked on, and there are only a small amount of developers (Not unheard of from indy games) so patience is key. Tickets for support have a quick turn around time though can require some technical knowledge by the player to help solve problems.Current Rating : 3/5 Stars			"

												If you want to play a single shard (single sever/world) game, there are only two options, this game or Eve-online. I have played both. I like Perpetuum mainly because of robots and lively planets as opposed to endless black space in Eve-online. Another reason is low population on perpetuum, which allows you to rise quickly within the perpetuum community and make lot of friends. In Eve-online, considering the size of the universe and player community, it is easy for a new player to feel lost. It is hard to make significant impact within the game, where as in Perpetuum you can. This game has it's learning curve and earning the in-game experience before your robots can take on veterans. But trust me, this game is addicting as hell, once you get into the grooves. If you want one single reason to buy this game, this is a single shard, perpetual world. Just like a alternate life. You will feel part of the perpetual world.  "

												This game is an interesting premise; sandbox/resource-centric game featuring robots.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it.Pros- Persistent, open, sandbox, malleable world.- PvE and PvP with distinct and separate areas for each.- Player controlled economy- Player created/maintained corporations (guilds).- Extensive crafting system.- Complex time-based skill system- Good number of robots to choose from each with pros and cons.Cons- Not newbie friendly (Overly long and tedious tutorial)- Clunky UI (Not suited for people that have trouble with small/fine print)- Few, large, old, player empire corporations- Silent in-game community.  Overly helpful with too much information for a question asked then quiet the rest of the time.  May also overwhelm new players with 'gifts' of in-game money for no reason.- Extremely low population for an MMO.- Boring combat with limited cover mechanic (target, press button, watch auto-combat, rinse, repeat)- Crafting system is a long, drawn-out process that can take several hours or days to complete an item.     This game could be so much more and does have elements to it that can make it interesting.  The background story also has merit but hasn't been expanded upon at all since its initial inception.     If you played this game before and wish to return to see what's changed, some things have but the biggest change is the sheer lack of people.     If you're new, this game will test your patience and you're likely to walk away bored or frustrated (or both).			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to write an unbiased review as possible, this is coming from a person who has played many, many games, across many genres. The good and bad in no particular order:1.Now as it stands, the UI is atrocious, especially for a game where so much attention is needed to information on the screen for you to get around and do things, anyone with even slightly poor eyesight will probably be annoyed and have a hard time reading the font size that is unchangeable (as far as I could tell) on the UI, I know I was annoyed and my eyesight isn't bad enough to warrant glasses or contact lenses. (bad)2. The World does seem to be alive, with things going on around you, though when I played there hadn't been that many people on, but I found some nonetheless, and the possibilities for exploration are very, very great. (good)3.  The Tutorial is very, very well put together, you learn everything you need to, to get started in the game. Though the tutorial check list seems a bit daunting at first, its pretty easy to follow (with the exception of the horrible font size), and at the end of it all you get some free stuff after completing it that helps you out when you finally get to the game world proper (if you skip the tutorial you don't, good incentive, not to mention you'll be completely lost if you aren't already coming from a game like EVE online). (good)4. One of the bad parts about the game is that after the tutorial (and chosing the faction you want) you aren't really prompted to do anything, you kinda just spawn at the beginners base of said faction and nothing comes up to tell you what to do. The Quests (Assignments) are very repetitive, mostly go to ""A"" attack ""B"" get ""Item"" from ""B""'s wreckage deliver ""Item"" to ""C"", or go to area ""A"" scan for ""certain mineral/Artifact"" locate ""mineral/artifact"" mine/retrieve ""mineral/artifact"" and deliver to ""B"" or some variation there of, the only difference is that the more in good standing you are with the faction you chose at the end of the tutorial increasingly difficult assignments are unlocked for you to complete, but they never stray far from this template. The game feels very grindy for a game with time-based progression, you have to log in once a day to get certain points to level up skills of your choosing, and you need to level up certain skills to be able to use more powerful mechs, so even if you have the money, you can't use the mech till you level up the skills to use it. (bad)5. The graphics are atrocious for 2014, or even 2011 or 2010 when the game launched beta or alpha. Maybe for 2003 or 2004 they were good, but damn they ungly now. The mechs don't feel like mechs... look kinda flimsy, even the ones you get to try out during the tutorial which take some time to acquire, (not that they are bad in combat, they just don't look it is all). The sounds for the mechs are also bad, too low when they shoudn't be and cut in and out constantly, the ""thump, thump"" that you would expect a heavy bipedal mech to have as it walks isn't there, the sounds for the weapons are also bad, except for the missle, which I'd say is alright all around. (bad)6. Combat is in the vein of Mech warrior online, just with longer locking target times, and point and click targeting/firing, and chance based hitting depending on the weapon used, not as exciting as mech warrior online, but still fun, if you manage to get into a battle that'll make you sweat a bit (that probably won't happen early on), may be too many variables to take into consideration for some people though. Mechs of the same class from the 3 different factions balance each other out well. (good)7. Crafting in the game is also very, very grindy, you must acquire research points by the hundreds by looting ""kernels"" from wreckage of mechs you destroyed. Only one kernel amounts to one research point, and you get anywhere from atleast 1 (most of the time, rarely none) to 10 kernels from a mech you destroyed (though i only played the beginning and therefore they may drop more kernels the harder the enemies get), and you need from what I saw in the research panel thousands of them, and you need 2 types of kernels for some 3 research trees with atleast 1 different type of kernel required for each tree. Honestly though you can start making money after your first investment in any one of the trees (you can pursue all of the them, choosing one doesn't exclude you from the rest), by building that first item (which requires you to scan, locate and mine for minerals/metal), and selling it on the market, which gets you a good amount of money from what I saw. Making money seems to be very easy in the game, but money doesn't give you everything, because skill trees and research points must be advanced/unlocked/gained first which is good, but the hard grind you have to commit to isn't. (bad)These aspects are the ones I chose to review the game from, there are a few more but they don't matter as much to someone just starting out in the game, because it takes a lot of grinding to get to those aspects. Time is something someone who plays this game is going to want to have alot of to get anywhere in it. EVE players wouldn't mind maybe, but not all players are are people who've played EVE and thats why I've written this, because most people who reviewed the game don't seem to review it from an unbiased point of view. But don't take my word for it try it out yourselves if you have the money to spare, its great in some aspects and poor in others, I'd give it a no on the recommendation rating, but I dont speak for everyone.

												The trailer on steam makes it seem like its some sort of cool action based mechwarrior online game. Fast paced, mech combat stomping around blasting stuff. Nope. Not even close. This is closer to EvE online (ever so slightly), with mechs, only much worse graphics and very slow paced gameplay . UI is very clunky and overly complex. Hated how so much of my screen was needed for UI elements. Controls were pretty bad too. Not very intuitive. Unless you have a LOT of time to invest into just learning this game and dealing with the complex mechanics, its probably not a game you will enjoy.			"

												November 2014 review:Never got off the ground, market based game with no market.  2/5- dont play it unless you have a small group and are willing to play with the broken economy.Gameplay:Its like eve with robots, go watch a video, not the most exciting thing but the robots do play differently.This is a game that is pretty much eve, but the market has nobody really buying or creating on the whole. Same wait for your skills style progression, not really a problem there but what this thing really lacks is contentThings you can do in this game:Missions:-Incredibly boring, only 4 or 5 missions per level. Skip these once you have the cash to.Beacons:-go in small groups of 2-15 and fight stages of NPCS, this was fun but does require a group to do, do these instead of missions for fun.Industry:-You will need to build 90% of your own things. Because there is rarely anything for sale locally. Also not a lot of people buying things. Not too bad to build all your own stuff, I had fun doing this for a while until I got into medium robots and the curve would take too long to get more interesting things.Exploration:-Kind of like eve explo content except scanning is done through triangulation. Good way to make money but gets boring pretty fast because there are only 2 or 3 site types worth anything due to the market status.PvP:-This is supposedly a big draw of the game, but through my 10 or so hours wandering through the low sec of the game I only found 4 fights. Three of which either I was afk watching something else because I hadn't seen anything in 30 minutes or the other guy was AFK presumably doing the same thing. Last one was a 5 man group, but at least it was something!With the market so dead, it just isnt a game you can play the way it was meant to. Sad but its not happening. If you have 5 or 6 friends interested in exploring this game with you, you can probably get your moneys worth- but as it stands just not enough content to be worth it.			"

Posted: April 30, 2016
												A time based MMO involving mechs.  The only other game remotely like this is Eve online.  You can't dispute it.  The skill progression here is much better though because you don't have to actively pick what skills you want to level up, you just accrue points every day.  I'm pretty much addicted to this game. I played it in 2012 but stopped due to boredom.  But I'm back several years later because there just aren't too many games like this on the market.  Perp definately has potential.  A few short comings in certain areas, such as the poor graphics and GUI.  The lead dev Zoom has stated that they'd like to do a graphics update but lack of funding is preventing that.  This game has a very small audience but die hard fans.  The PVP and combat isn't as intense as Eve.  You can't rotate around your opponent so fast that their lasers cant hit you.  But you can use the environment to your advantage.  Faster mechs generally do far better as they can run away if things get hot.  PVP is Perp is full loot.  That means when you die, you lose everything and your opponent gets some of your loot.  PvP isn't completely open however.  There are various islands.  You are relatively safe from PvP for quite some time as by the time you make it to the beta islands, you're pretty powered up.  With this being a time based skill progression game however, that will take some time......unless you purchase the two packs along side the main game.  Those two packs save you 5 1/2 months of time.  I think they're worth $20.  So the main issue with Perp is the lack of a player base.  The game is mostly player driven.  That means that after the starter islands, you won't find gear or new mechs sold by NPC's, only by players.  So if their aren't any players left, then you pretty much have to craft everything yourself.  I've never found it difficult to find gear though, at least not yet. The game has ALOT of grinding and is pretty much P2W unfortunately.  This really can't be disputed.  You can pay real money to buy extension point upgrades that give you more skill points over time than non paying customers.  As this game has full loot pvp on the beta and gamma islands, people that put alot of real money into this game will get ahead faster.  The argument could be said that those that don't wish to pvp can just stay on the alpha islands.  Ok....so about half the content is on the latter islands.  If you want to build colonies and terraform for your guild (corporation) then you need to leave the alpha islands.  You will eventually pvp with other folks that want to ruin your day.  I can say however, that pvp in Perp isn't as sadistic as Eve.  You won't have people camping your mining spot waiting for you to jettison some ore so they can steal it and flag themselves as hostile.  So there you.  You can mine, treasure hunt, do combat, build modules and mechs for other players, etc etc.  The only thing you can't do in this sandbox MMO is be a trader I suppose becasue most of the game is player driven.  So I suppose you could raise inflation if you wanted to be a jerk.  But this isn't elite dangerous level's of trading where one hub needs supplies more than another hub.  It's all mostly player driven after the starter island.Here is a Let's Play I did.  It explains the UI and how the mission structure works.

			Here is another obscure gem. Perpetuum is a time based skill MMO very much like Eve Online. Infact Eve and Perp are the only 2 time based MMO's on the market. So if you're sick of Eve.

One could choose roles involving PVE, PVP, support, crafter.   If you can fully integrate yourself into this true sandbox experience you will have an opportunity to create and be apart of a meaningful experience.			"

												I might be biased, but I like sandbox MMOs and theres so few true ones out there, but this is one of them. Sandbox MMOs are usually only targeted towards a very small community of players and Perpetuum isnt any different. It has a decently low population compared to many other typical class/level/themepark MMOs. However, it doesnt lack any proper tools or contents. Everything needed in the game is in there. Some things could definatly get a little overhaul, like organisation and UI for corps (alliances?) ect. but nothing is truly missing, its in there and it works.			"

Early Access Review
								Cant write enough about this game. Definitely a hidden gem that only lacks a bit of investment by those seeking an amazing futuristic scifi sandbox mmo. If you enjoyed EvE you will enjoy Perpetuum. My only issues with the game after 650 hours of play time is the poor UI. If there was a better elevation depiction on the Radar for pvp and also a sort of Tactical overlay like what EvE has I would be completely content giving it a 10/10. Main reasons for the lack of said fixes? No one seems to know about this game :PI played EvE for over 6 years and got fed up with the subscriptions and lack of pvp mechanics to support small scale combat as well as large scale combat without becoming the ""death blob"" where any monkey who can listen to an FC call targets and hit F1 can be a pvper. In Perpetuum there are mechanics such as interference and AoE damage when robots explode. 100 man drake fleets would not want to orbit the fc at 500m in Perpetuum because if one or two die in close proximity to the rest of the fleet it would be a beautiful cascade of exploding drakes. I have been on the winning and losing side of those cascades and it gets me every time. PvP in perpetuum is the reason I remain here instead of returning to EvE. Every individual needs to be aware of their strengths/weaknesses/surroundings to avoid being a hindrance to a group let alone being effective.I also spent my first two years in EvE doing industry. As far as crafting goes in EvE it is usually straight forward until you get to t2/t3 manufacturing. All of the crafting in Perpetuum is like t3 and t2 where you must first unlock what you wish to create by gathering kernals and then spending said kernals. After an item is unlocked (there are two trees, one for personal research and one for corporation research. Having an item unlocked for the corp as well as the individual will give bonuses) you can then prototype it. A prototype is much more expensive than the module/robot you wish to produce. It also requires some additional resources that are gathered from destroyed npc's. Once the protoype is done it can be Reverse Engineered into a CT or Calibration Template. The CT is like the BPC in EvE. There are no BPO's, you must continually prototype and reverse engineer what you wish to produce as your CT's get worn-out. As the CT gets used it becomes less and less efficient also. To get the materials needed to actually do the manufacturing side of things it will require components made of a combination of plants, liquids, and ores from various islands to make a finished product. I know these are fat blocks of text but every detail is needed for this game. The pvp system far exceeds EvE online and the Crafting system has such a depth to it that eve will never reach simply because the sinks for resources and currency are so high. It requires a very hardcore gamer to truly understand this game and it requires an equally hardcore community to utilize all the picks and shovels in this sandbox.			"

												Overall this is a great game.  It is Eve done better.  If you're familiar with Eve, then...You pay a little bit of money, once, and never again.  It truly has no further maintenance costs.Rather than space ships you're piloting robots and mechs on a planet with day/night cycles, terrain, trees and cool structures dotting the landscape.Better, easier, faster travel.Does not end up feeling like an exercise in spreadsheet analysis.You can't be podded, so all you can lose is the vehicle and whatever it was carrying.If you think Eve is a biblical reference, then...We are talking robots and mechs, baby!  Big ones, little ones, scampering ones -- all shapes and sizes.  All set on a futuristic planet where you are remotely controlling one to do whatever you want.  You can kill other robots/mechs.  You can gather resources (harvesting and mining).  You can process gathered resources.  You can research new technologies.  You can prototype your newly researched technology.  You can reverse engineer your prototype to create a blueprint.You can use the blueprint to manufacture copies of the newly researched tech until the blueprint overheats and melts through the floor.You can play with the in-game economy, buying goods in one place and selling them somewhere else.You can claim territory (with a corporation), set up defenses and then work to defend it from all comers.You can terraform part of the world to remake it as you see fit.You can do at least half a dozen other things that aren't springing to mind right now.They start you off with a really nice tutorial and a tease.  The tutorial guides you through all the game areas and lets you try out everything.  You can max out all your skills, buy any 'bot or mech in the game, trick it out, etc.  The catch is, once you're done, everything resets back to zero and then you actually start the game.  If you do the whole tutorial they give you two robots (one that you really shouldn't be piloting yet) and enough modules to get decent starter configurations.  The tease is that they let you drive mechs you won't be able to use effectively for at least a couple of weeks.You progress through the game primarily by improving your skills.  Skills are initially purchased for a token fee (only really a barrier for the first week or so) and skill points (called EP) and then improved up to a maximum of 10 levels with more EP.  EP are earned over time (so long as you log in every 3 days).  If you're in a huge hurry, you can pay them money to get it to accumulate 50% faster, but it still isn't instant gratification, so most people don't bother.To start you off, they give you a months worth of EP.  That is enough for a decent start in one area of endeavor, for example, combat or harvesting/production.  If you make mistakes, you have 30 days to undo your skill choices (with some restrictions) and, in time, you'll accumulate enough EP that it won't matter anyway.If PvP is your thing, there are whole islands with open PvP.  Even if you're not into PvP, it can be worth it to take a risk and mine, harvest, mission, etc in those areas for enhanced rewards.  If PvE is your thing, there are plenty of areas where you can not be attacked unless you take a hostile action.  So, you can ignore the PvP altogether if you want.There is a death penalty in this game, though.  You won't lose any skills, but you will lose whatever you were piloting and everything it was carrying.  You can insure your ride, but, that really just serves to lessen the blow.  As in real life, they will only pay a faction of what a new one costs.  Again, money comes pretty easily, though, it can take a while to put the configuration back together the way you like it -- of course, that IS part of the fun.The developers are actively working to improve the game.  They release an update every couple of months or so and fixes as needed in between.Overall the online community is friendly and helpful.  They come across as a little sleepy simply because most people are paying more attention to what is going on in their own corporations (guilds) rather than the public channels.I do see a few negatives with this game: It is an open world sand box in the true meaning of that phrase.  If you're yearning to have the game set the goals and/or lead you around by the nose, this is not the game for you.The mission system is really designed to give a little variety to your normal activities.  If you're looking for a main storyline quest or questing hubs or to be told a story through quests, this is not the game for you.The skill system is very complex and takes a fair amount of research (read the forums, read one of the excellent game guides, play with the skill planner).  If you're looking for straight path to the omfgbbqpwnzor button, this game is not for you.As with the skill system, outfitting bots and mechs is very complex and takes a fair amount of research.  If you're looking for the zomgTitanSmitesYou world beating mech, it doesn't exist and this game is not for you.I've experienced some intermittant game crashes.  It really isn't too bad and tends to happen right after I deploy into the field (where I'm still in a safe area), but it is pretty disappointing in a MMORPG that has been around for four years. "

												Quite an interesting game with enough chalange to keep you busy for quite some time. In comparison to many other games it requires some thinking, this side has enough to keep you going for a long time. However, the servers seem kind of empty, and it is a true sandbox game... it is what you make of it. If you like a steep learning curve, don`t mind the somewhat outdated graphics, no fancy cutscences in combination with a game that actually makes you think you will enjoy this. Take in account that it`s at the fee of 2 months of subscription of most MMO games it is very enjoyable.			"

Second: some of the people who actually do paly this are nothing but trolls who only play the game so they can be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to other players. Despite this, the game is pretty sweet and I'll be playing for a long time, even if I only play it to get rid of the infestation of trolls on Perpetuum.			"

												tldr; I'm a nub, and so far the game is ^^^ with lots left to learn - but the early game is a sharp-ish learning curve.--Disclaimer: At the time of this writing I am 6 hours into the game; this review is written from a very nub perspective.My first impression of this game from the trailers was, ""This could be what a Mechwarrior/Battletech MMO could have been...""  Well, it turns out, not exactly; while the game view is notably more like Mech Commander than anything else I've played, the rest of the game play is very reminiscent of EVE, complete with things that sound hard to do, until you do them.  Once.  That's all it takes.The tutorial is very detailed (and for good reason) but moves quickly as you go step-by-step through learning the interface, which is largely accessible by visible buttons on the UI.  The mech bay view (where you get your missions, store your unused-but-not-sold items, store materials you will eventually sell/use for crafting, research, skillgain, buy/sell, and configure your mechs [called robots in the game, since your pilot is remote rather than within]) is fairly easy to adapt to, and is one of the reasons I mention EVE.  Cargo is nearly identical in terms of access, repairs, movement between bays, and unit configuration, and market access and use it all but the same as I recall it (from about 4 years ago), but skill gains are different, almost opposite.  Where in EVE you would select a skill and a timer would start and count down to completion of study, this game accrues skill points daily at a set rate (which can be increased with ingame functions); when you login you get your allotment of points, then for the next 2 days you gain points again, whether you login or not.  If you don't login after the third day though your skillpoint gain stops, and will begin again when you login next.  Said points are then spent for an immediate gain of a skill on a scale from 1-10, with difficulty/complexity ratings that modify skill gain (again, same as EVE did) to cost more points the more complex the skill is rated.Combat is fairly straightforward.  The one thing that I do not like is that there seems to be no 'shooting from the hip' at all, ever; you wait until your guns lock on, even if you're at point blank range, then engage them and they fire on a timer, automatically quitting when the primary target is out of range or destroyed.You can loot containers while fighting.  You can lock several targets at once, provided they are in range of your gear/skill.  You can reload guns in combat.There are non-combat focused missions as well as combat missions, and you can toggle PVP on/off.In base areas there are tiles placed to speed movement; very helpful.The chat community seems friendly so far, and is knowledgeable and helpful when asked clear questions.Completing the tutorial was an area of boredom, until I realized that I actually did need to know 'all this crap.'  DO the tutorials, but don't stick around trying to farm easy loot from drones, or using your materials to gain research, or anything else; you all but full reset once you join the real world via choosing a faction.  I advise that you want to budget ~2 hours for the tutorial.  That's LONG, and don't be in doubt, it can be done much faster, but use this time to learn the game as far as you can, given no true baptism by fire.This is a serious game for serious gamers, but can be enjoyed by teens on up to graybeards.  There is some number crunching, and I have yet to PVP, but so far... so good.Bottom line: I reckon I can get a couple hundred hours out of this game in its current state.8/10 would buy game on sale again.  For the time I expect to put in, paying full price would still be a good deal.Nice job, Avatar Creations!			"

												I really wanted to like this game - no subscriptions and a player-driven economy?  Sounds great :)  Throw in a sci-fi setting?  Now you're getting my juices flowing!  Unfortunately two things let this game down - the environments, while pleasant enough, are lacklustre in terms of context (there isn't any).  On each island you're just presented with a landscape plus ""frills"" which include frankly derpy looking vegetation and buildings which not only serve no purpose but also which aren't even attributed a purpose - they're just there.  Secondly, the graphics are really poorly implemented.  They're not good graphics in the first place and I have a half-decent and modern GPU-processor combo, yet I had appalling framerates.  The worst of it is that this wasn't a product of the engine being really great, or of not having suitable graphical nerfs included in the menu - the framerates for me were low even with all the graphics settings turned right down and, worst of all, seemed to drop off as a result of calculations being made regarding  visual  stuff going on which wasn't being rendered in any way.  It's a really stupid problem - say I'm sat at the edge of an island, near the coast.  Looking 180 degrees in the coastwards direction, framerates are fine.  The other 180 degrees entail a droppng framerate which is worst when looking towards the centre of the island where all the ""stuff"" is happening  despite the fact that there's a fecking mountain in the way!   This can't be due to anything other than sloppy programming, since the ""stuff"" going on is always going on, no matter where I'm looking, and is not rendered because of BIG geographical obstacles.  There is also the immersion-breaking issue of walking robots  skating over the ground.   I mean how difficult would it have been to time the animation to the movement speed so that the impression of walking is actually achieved?  The community is good, nice people, very helpful and the idea is not too bad.  It's just poorly implemented.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless it goes F2P, it's certainly not worth £20-odd.			"

												This game is not for everyone especially those who just wants to jump in and play in mechs due to skill system and permenat mech and equipment loss upon death.Though if you can over look that you will find a very good roboust sandboxish mmo with mechs in it and fairly friendly playerbase (if not small).Once you get settled in and learn how the game works you are basicly free to do what you want within your skills parameters.In shortPros-Very in depth systems with lots to do-rewards exploration and risk taking-big worlds-Lots of crafting and building/terraformingCons-Time based progression that can hinder player enjoyment due very slow leveling-Low player population-Crafting is very complex so don't expect to beable to make anything without investing a large amount into gathering and -skills to make crafting easier and cheaper.-Permanent loss of mech and equip early on can be huge issue for new players.Over all if you don't mind doing a bit of reading or experimenting and have a bit of time to kill every now and again this is a great game.Though I would avoid this if you are looking for a game with moderately paced progression system and general.

												I was expecting a bit more from this game. For me it's just too low key, very slow paced. Graphics arent the best but not terribad for a game of this caliber. I just felt under and overwhelmed at the same time with this game. The tutorial was a great one, and explained everything with good detail, I just didnt find any of it appealing, and I love games like this. Crusader Kings 2 is one of my favorite games, I love Eve online. Just for some reason, this game didnt click with me. Its missing something, for me anyway. This isnt saying it's not a good game for someone else, apparently it has plenty of good reviews, it just isnt my cup of tea.			"

												If you're the kind of person who enjoys empire building and large scale team play where you're in an open unforgiving environment setting your own goals and making your own fun then this game is for you.Perpetuum doesn't hand you victory. It doesn't take you on a stroll through a beautiful theme park like most MMOs. You have to work, fight, and build every inch of success you make here. As a result the highs are incredible and the lows are quite low.  I personally love it. This game is very much in the hands of the person playing it.  It's hardcore for the hardcore type of player. Many have compared it to Eve Online circa 2004 except with mechs.			"

Think EvE online with robots and your there.All i will say is, if you want the best from this game then run the tutorial or you will be asking for help every 10 seconds and get lost in the complexity of the game. This isn't for carebear gamers who want rewards for just turning the game on. It is hard, It takes some getting used to AND YOU WILL DIE and lose your stuff and mechs. Decent MMO though. 9/10			"

												I have played this game for about 5 days. I hate to make the the comparison but it most closely resembles EvE Online though with robots on islands instead of ships in space. This is not a mechwarrior first person game rather it is mechs from third person perspective. There are some differences from EvE that are notable. You can use environmental objects as cover during combat for one. The community is small but dedicated to the game. There are player corporations and territorial disputes with safe zones for PvE and zones for PvP. For whatever reason this game hasnt taken off and lags behind EvE graphically by about 10 years. It does however have an entertaining slightly addictive feel to it. It is definitely worth a try at the under 10 dollar price.			"

												As one who has played MMO's for many years. Eve for some of those years. I have found a good home in Perpetuum.  The pvp is addicting. The crafting and mining in this game has no challenge except for perhaps EVE. This is a sandbox mmo. So you do what you want. When you want. There is no subscription fee.While there is a tutorial to learn the basics.  It is basically up to you on what you wish to do. You can make your own corp or join one already in game. Currently there are two alliances. War on a continuous basis(Both economically and military).For those players who have to be hand fed things to do. I do not recommend this game. But if you like a challenge. Would like to build your own little place on our planet of Nia. Like pvp, like combat, like making your involvement matter. Then this game is just for you! This game is not for the feint of heart. But if you enjoy a challenge. Then I challenge you to take part in a highly dynamic world and community that is Perpetuum.			"

												If you want this game go try the free trial for Eve online first. The game hub is nearly identical to Eve and can be overwhelming for some but if you can get used to or like the the way Eve is set up you'll be right at home in Perpetuum. Continueing with the Eve comparison this game does feel easier and more welcoming than Eve. While i haven't reached that stage yet, you will need to find friends/corparations to continue past a point in the game, just like Eve. Sorry for all the Eve comparisions but it's the closest thing to Perpetuum out there that can be tried for free. Try it, if you like it than you can play Perpetuum without being disapointed or shocked at it's gameplay. -dark*This is my review but in games the best way to find out if you like it is to try it.

												+ Lots of career choices (combat, mining, trading, exploration and a couple more)+ learn skills with time and not with killing enemies (gives you time to appreciate and learn your current set of skills+ player driven market+ emphasis on player corporation and co-op play (its more fun)+ research and craft your own components for your robot3.5.7 UPDATE (15 June 2015) + missions are given on the field which means less time traveling- not enough players in total playing the game- player driven market is not filled enough- graphics are outdated- updates are slow compared to other mmo- not enough exploration- Combat is static (lock and shoot)- not enough lore and stories- Lack of gameplay contentI played the beta a long time ago and I liked it at that time. Unfortunately they went with a subscription model and I wasn't ready to spend cash on a monthly basis. The reason it wasn't to my standard.before I begin my review, to be clear and honest, I did not touch the pvp so take that into account. I've only heard about it.

Posted: November 27, 2016
												What an excellent game! I'll preface this review by saying that I'm an OLD-school player. I  enjoy an honest-to-goodness sandbox game, and played EvE for years. I have been looking for a game like EvE but more suited to my personal tastes, and Perpetuum is perfect. The skill system is similar to EvE, but is different in one important aspect: points are based on playtime instead of simply time. There are skill point rewards you receive while you do certain tasks, and then these points can be awarded to the skills you choose. That's more satisfying to me than EvE's platform, and it moves much quicker because the point system is pretty generous, and is not fixed. Point bonuses are random, but you have to play to earn them.Another improvement is the fact that the mechs are land-based, and line-of-sight along with terrain becomes very important in PvP. The mechs can be specialized in great detail, much like the ships in EvE.Fair warning about this game. If you like complexity, depth of gameplay, and the rewards that come with a player-driven economy, you'll enjoy Perpetuum. If you are used to theme-park games and are looking for constant action, this is not what you're looking for. PvP is expensive, and finding a good corporation early in order to teach you the ropes is essential. There's a lot of repetitive play involved, but this is rooted in old-school game philosophy.I've recently played Xyson (good game but no one plays), Albion Online (too commercialized for me), Anarchy Online, TERA, SotA, and a bunch of others looking for a good crafting-based game that also has PvP. Perpetuum is it. The sale right now makes it extremely worthwhile to pick up, and the optional DL's add huge value to the package. For less than 10 bucks you can get enough points to be competitive in-game.Most people giving a thumbs-down are simply not interested in the type of gameplay Perpetuum offers. As a genuine sandbox game, there's very little in the way of competition on the market. (Especially if you enjoy EvE, but want some interesting differences in mechanics and the way skills work.)Lastly...in a game like this, graphics are secondary to gameplay. However, the game is beautiful, and the graphics are pretty damned good tbh. They just aren't cutting-edge. Some games have great graphics and no gameplay at all. NO MAN can argue with that, yeah?2 BIG thumbs up!!			"

I had a Perpetuum acct from looong ago and enjoyed it, but didnt have the time for subscription based games. Long story short, I purchased this on steam, then linked my Perpetuum acct..., well that was the wrong order lol, i now had a steam acct and my old account that wasnt activated.So I sent in a ticket asking to kill the steam purchased account and activate my old acct. DONE.

												I would say yes on the whole of it. It does play well the crafting systems is very lovely as well as the researching process. The combat can be a bit on the target side strafe sort of thing but at least you control the bots/mechs as well so you still can use cover from trees and other terrain in combat. There are plenty of bugs to iron out there is a slight lack of in depth content however the base line game is there and if more people start playing and continue to grow the community in backing the devs on this one it could easily sustain itself and be a quite enjoyable game if not for the whole day at least it is fun for an afternoon with some friends and wolf pack it up in pve/pvp.

												I can't recommend this game unfortunately.  I bought it on sale and was immediately baffled by the extremely obtuse UI; I managed to die somehow in the tutorial area and while I was immediately resurrected, I still do not understand what happened.  Interactable objects give no feedback and are not clearly marked.  The real deal-sealer was the chat though--people there were discussing how they never left the noob zone because of the PVP hunters waiting outside to absolutely murder any attempt to play the wider game.

												Let me start by saying i am a 13 year player of EVE-Online and that should tell you a lot about my perspective.So, Perpetuum...Well, its EVE with mechs!What is there not to like about that? There are many things in the game that will frustrate any EVE player and completely block a new guy to the hardcore style.So, let me start with the bad. The Bad:Stuff that isnt explained, gameplay mechanics that are completely useless and only serve to enfuriate players, procedures that OMG shouldnt be there at all and drive players nuts especialy at the start.The Good:Its a copy of EVE in lots and lots of ways but without complicating stuff so much.The Awesome:The story is just beautiful. I loved it the second i read it and just makes me adore the sci-fi setting.In the end, i fully recomend it for any EVE player and anyone of those will enjoy it immensely. For a standard run of the mill player i would also recomend but with the propper caveats attached.			"

I would say there are more tactics involved here than in eve because you can take cover and you move your robot with WASD controls. Gamma makes it full sandbox as youcan even terraform/build/destroy bases and it has faction control and territory control. Is it worthed at the end of the day? Well, It's buy once and play forever so I think it will be money well spent at the end but do not expect a lot of frequent updates and content. Team is indie and small but they do deliver eventually :) They just added new missions for PVE players and it is well done I must say. My best advice:Join a corporation form the start as it makes a really big difference and do not be shy to ask for advices, lots of friendly dudes willing to share their knowledge.PS. Do not see hours on record, I play from the game client not the steam one. For help and advices contact in game name: Toninu			"

												I just started playing the game but it seems a lot like EVE using mechs and robots instead of ships without the annoying monthly subscription. The game seems extremely deep with multiple paths to take, from what I have read you can actually open all paths with enough time. Which I think is a good thing. The combat is engaging and fun, the industry/crafting has a lot of depth. Another nice feature is the currency used to upgrade your skills are provided for free as long as you keep logging in every three days. The assignments (missions/quests) are helpful to learn the game. I strongly suggest that you play through the tutorial to get the additional rewards provided on upon completion.			"

												This game is not for every one, but there are many things you can do to amuse yourself for those that like this style of game. Yes it is eve'ish, but that is good and bad both, yes it has a very long very hand holdy tutorial and then drops you off and lets you run with out any hand holding. There are many things i can say positive and a few that are negative. The positive is it is robots! You can build, reasurch and destroy them.  The game is being revamped to implement some good ideas, no they didnt think the origional design was good enough , basically an eve clone on the ground. The negative is there is a low population and takes awhile to get anywhere in game be it reasurch a manufacturer or a battle bot.

												I was quite surprised by this game.In this you are effectively a computer virus of some form that infests one of the local robots. Through this you eventually grow on your path towards a specific race of robots, each with their strong suits. The green bots favor missiles and shields (basically turning the game into a form of high-stakes ""peek-a-boo""), the blue robots are quicker and utilize railgun tech, meanwhile the yellow robots are sturdy armor tankers that enjoy lasers. There are many, many traits that go with the robot, each of which can be skilled up by spending daily-acquired skillpoints. The skills vary from mining efficiency to how fast you can fire a weapon.Even in the earlier stages of the game you can find good and sustainable ways for income to your character in the form of hunting mobs/pvp raiding/industry, familiar to the ever-so-referenced EVE Online. You can even start an alien farm. With simple gameplay mechanics it is strangely relaxing to have your robo simply unleash hell on mobs while taking in the well-thought-out alien environment. Plus, if you decide to throw down only 10$bux a month (which is about the price of a chipotle lunch) you get a lot more skillpoints that grow at a continual rate.PROS:Simple gameplay, high ceilingPlayer-ran ecoPlayer-ran territory control (higher levels)Does not take all of your day, can be played in segmentsNew-player friendly communityCute robotsMurderous robotsBizarre art-styleSurreal OSTSolo play is very feasibleCONS:Requires a thirst for knowledgeUI can feel a bit strange at timesEarlier areas are very open, almost lonesomely soEnemy AI may need a bit of tweakingAlmost too easy to farm at times "

												If you like EVE you will like Perpetuum!Pros  Easy to get into if you played EVE  Dynamic tactical action packed combat (compared to EVE)  Great community of playersCons  Graphics  Small Indie Dev team For the reviewers that don't like this game I notice 2 main things, They haven’t played EVE and the steep learning curve and UI that this game and EVE share turn off a lot of people when they expect it to be an action game from the trailer. Or the reviewer has played EVE but believes Perpetuum to be inferior. Mainly because of graphics but also the game is different in some ways. What made EVE a success wasn’t the graphics, but the dynamic player driven gameplay, and I believe perpetuum captures that same feeling. At first it’s hard to adjust to crawling around on the ground, instead of cruising through space. But the fact that you interact with terrain gives the combat in this game a level of depth and interaction EVE will never have. When I grind combat missions in EVE, I warp into a “room” target the enemies and then fire my weapons to destroy them keeping an eye on my shield bar and slow boating around in the meantime like a blimp, if I am in a battleship.In Perpetuum, I travel to the combat site and target the enemies from afar and then run in to engage them, while firing at them I can run around the terrain as will the enemies, using cover to block weapons fire. The shields in perpetuum are very dynamic, while you have your shield enabled it consumes your “capacitor energy” directly to absorb damage, meaning as long as you have capacitor energy you will basically be invincible. The tradeoff is of course while your shield is up your weapons cannot fire back, but they can reload! This gives another level of depth and management to combat, having your shield up while reloading or when you anticipate enemy fire, and lowering it to counterattack. The shield also seems very useful for industrial ships, as they can activate it to by time while they run away from whatever would be attacking them, having no need to return fire.In my own personal experience the people in this game are fantastic. I was concerned about playing such a team and cooperation oriented game without my usual group of gaming friends and going into the world solo. But after a few hours of playing I and several other new players in the starting area received an anonymous donation of in game money from the individual who had been answering all the questions in the help channel all morning. I only found out who it was because of my experience in EVE I could find the sender of the money in the transaction window. When the other newbs asked who it was in chat he never said anything or took credit.Needless to say, after talking to him for a bit, I’ve joined his corp (ETHOS) and couldn’t be happier. I was already starting to enjoy the game more and more as I got into it and it became more challenging, but now that I am part of a great community it is 100% better. Some of the people I talked to have been playing for 5 to 3 years!. Most of them tell me they have quit Eve because the community on this game is much nicer and I have to agree. I haven’t seen a single negative person or anyone spamming dodgy money doubling schemes in chat. And so far, no one has cheesed a way to destroy my robot or grief me in the non PvP areas. The amount of time I’ve lost a ship in High sec in EVE to a player without willingly engaging in PvP is staggering. (for reference, I have 925 hours on EVE and have been playing off and on for years)Bottom line for the price point this game is 100% worth it if you know what you are getting into. The people that play are dedicated and it isn’t hard to get involved in the action and community. "

												This game is not for every one, but there are many things you can do to amuse yourself for those that like this style of game. Yes it is eve'ish, but that is good and bad both, yes it has a very long very hand holdy tutorial and then drops you off and lets you run with out any hand holding. There are many things i can say positive and a few that are negative. The positive is it is robots! You can build, reasurch and destroy them.  The game is being revamped to implement some good ideas, no they didnt think the origional design was good enough , basically an eve clone on the ground. The negative is there is a low population and takes awhile to get anywhere in game be it reasurch a manufacturer or a battle bot. So come try it out and if you like the comunitty then stay, if not ... well there is always wow for you.....			"

								I wanted to like this game, I really did.  The game seems quite polished and easy to pick up.  Although it is basically just EVE with Mechs instead of ships, I really don't think it brings anything new to the table.  Unfortunately...well, here's an analogy: it's like owning a sweet car but you always have to car-pool with a foul-mouthed misanthrope who continually demonstrates surprising immaturity.  The most vocal component of the community really lets this game down.  Shame.			"

								Perpetuum is worth buying if you always liked the idea behind EVE, but wanted something a little bit simpler. You might not like it if you've played EVE for a long time, since at times it could seem to be too simple when compared to it. It's also best to start playing this sooner rather than later, since skills are earned from time passage instead of actually playing.Video showing you what Perpetuum is all about:

												Firstly this game is awesome. Now you most likely want to know why, well I'm going to tell you.      Perpetuum gets referred to as being like ""Eve Online"" alot. Well there are similarities but It's not quite the same deal. In Perpetuum you get to costomize the fit of your robot or mech and run around the world doing as you please. Literally you can do whatever you want. You are going to be making the most fun for yourself, there's nothing that guides you through areas like a quest line.     Secondly it's a sandbox so having a goal in mind is a good idea although the missions and npc fights are fun. The bread and butter is the pvp which is a high risk/reward system.  There is somewhat of a learning curve but It's not that bad. The amount of freedom and choices you get for customization is enough to keep you interested especially if you like robots and mechs. It's fun experimenting to see what works and doesn't.     Next is the Industrial options. I think everything in this game can be made by the players. It's quite in depth and I had to read into it a little but after getting the hang of it, industry is alot of fun. I'm having fun with industry even though I primarily pvp. Gathering materials and kernels to make items, robots and mechs is the simpliest description of industry I can make.  The Market is player driven. Which also gives players options to ""Buy low and sell high"" if you're into making NIC that way. NIC is the in game money.     Lastly the community is great and willing to help, just make sure you join the general chat as well as the help! chat. I've already learned alot from the community and there's quite a few corps currently recruiting.  If you like games with depth and appear to be ""more than meets the eye"" this game could be for you. This review has hardly scratched the surface of Perpetuum. "

Early Access Review
								I haven't been playing Perpetuum nearly as long as some other reviewers, but having a first impression review may be useful to someone out there.After you complete the training missions, you can hop right into action and start blowing stuff up if you want.  There are industrial missions as well if you are into harvesting.  The stat grind is endless, so completionists will get their money worth from this game.  The faction leveling is slow, and the starting missions are very easy, but involve running around a lot.  I am hoping that once I get to level 2 missions there is less running around and more faction gain, but it's not that big of deal and typical of most MMOs.  The loot I am getting from NPCs I blow up at the start of the game is vendor trash for the most part, but rarely I get some item I can use which can feel rewarding.  Resource gathering is unique, and interesting.  Unlike other MMOs that have nodes everywhere, Perpetuum makes you search for the node by using scanners or giving you a general location via mission updates.  The first scanner you get isn't 100% accurate, so you have to use it a few times to get a bearing on where to head.  When you get close you use a different type of ammo in the scanner to indicate where exactly to dig.  I really like this feature compared with other MMOs.  I haven't played any PVP yet, but the ping I am getting on the US west coast is very low.  Especially now that they have relocated the server and optimized it.  Looking forward to loosing my first mech!The online community seems accepting to new players, and I have had all my questions answered without a gang of trolls chasing me around on chat and forums.  From what I have read Perpetuum has been in development for a considerable amount of time, and it really shows in the lack of bugs and quantity of hard core helpful players.  Great work!			"

Early Access Review
								I played a lot in early beta and was excited to see how things have come along but I was severly disappointed in the lack of graphical improvement since then. It's extremely bleak and simple. The gameplay is complex and engrossing and worth playing for but don't expect it to be very pretty. This is a real economy game, everything is made from resources gathered, station markets are independent and almost no products are seeded. Explore, scan, mine, gather, refine, research, build, manufacture, transport, trade, fight. It's all there and done well. A game that can recreate all aspects of a real world and can be played as simply or complex as you desire. Many comparisons to EvE Online are made. As I've spent many years in that game with high level characters I can say similiarities are present but Perpetuum is it's own game with it's own merits and deserves to be recognized as so. I would vastly prefer Perpetuum would they overhaul the graphics, possibly with the funds received from their Steam launch! lol.. It may be what makes the difference in new player retention as well. Now that the subs fee's are gone it's up to selling boost time. Something I plan to do to support this excellent game regardless.			"

You can spend the whole day playing or just as easily play it at your own pace with no pressure...

												The recent 50% off sale must have brought in a wave of people that thought they were getting something other than what was advertised.Yes, the graphics aren't the best, this isn't EVE or MWO.  They are on par with a RTS game like Supremacy or Command and Conquer.  The system is grindy, but so is every single other MMO.  The UI, once you understand it; and perhaps even do the whole tutorial, is easy to manage at first.  It also gets easier with the ability to remap keys.  The latest patch that allows you to gain EP (skill points) by doing tasks such as mining or fighting, allows people to gain EP pretty quick,My suggestion is to get in the game, mess around a bit to get your feet under you, and then find an existing ""corp"" that will help you learn the rest.  There are typically plenty of people willing to answer a question in general or help channel.  This isn't a blockbuster AAA game, and it isn't priced like it either.			"

												Absolute gem of a game, fairly large open world, with player ran markets, if you want to play solo or in a group you have that option you're not forced to join a Corporation if you don't wish to. PvE or PvP is entirely your choice. there are are six core islands that have pvp disabled by default and twelve additional islands where pvp is defaulted as on. In the furthest islands you're able to construct bases with attached facilities to increase production speeds and percentages so you can craft faster and more effecently, start farms and mining facilties to generate income.Pros:*Large open world with each island feeling unique in terrain and layout. (Supposedly the Gamma/Outer islands are terraformable but I haven't gotten that far yet)*Dynamic market ran by players*Fairly deep and expansive crafting system, granting you the ability to build any item or bot in game *Combat is actually complex, more than just lock target and spam missiles. There is a great deal of planning and reposistioning involved along with specific module timing that can make or break a fightCons:*UI is a bit of a hassle when you first start however you can quickly and easily resize the windows and make the hud shape to your desire.*Crafting can get very tedious in the higher tiers as you most contruct blueprints and items of the lower tiers and craft them into increasingly expensive items. This however does become less of an issue if you specialize into crafting and production or have someone in your corporation that is.*Kinda long tutorial that goes over every little aspect of the game, however it does award you a handful of ammo, modules, and some higher tier mechs for completing the tutorial. My biggest complaint is that you have to complete the tutorial to recieve these rewards every time you start a new character, which could get annoying.*Low population, as of this writing there is fifty players online. In the past two weeks I've seen it stay steadily at a hundred. The small population can be a plus however as that allows for more personal and intense corporation skirmishes in the outer islands when competing for dominance. Overall the somewhat low player count doesn't hurt the game but an increase of players would be nice.Overall, this game is an absolute gem for just $10. If you give it a chance and join a corporation you'll have a grand time making friends and growing in power. "

												There is a staggering amount of things to do in this game. It does have much in common with EVE in that it is highly windowed, but it also has some nice features that EVE is lacking, such as the ability to actually control combat (use cover, etc) and the ability to make changes to the world itself. The learning curve is steep, like EVE, but if you enjoyed that game, and have ever wondered how cool it would have been to have gotten in on the ground floor of a game like that before everyone else had an account 10 years older than yours, then come play this one. While it is early access, it's already 50 times more polished than EVE was when it was much older than this.			"

This could be both a good thing and a bad thing depending on what your experience was with EVE as the gameplay is quite comparable.The learning curve difficulty also exists if you are not familiar and/or used to navigation of heavy use of menus and other UI.At this point, I am still playing in the early stages, but so far, as a long time EVE player, I'm enjoying my experience.

												So i own this game for about 2 dayss now and i gotta say it´s awesome! You can play it any way you like, PVE, PVP, just raising up your mining corp. or trading business. Even though it´s called an indie game it has some really ambitious developers working on it´s progress. The trading system works great and the skill system is well balanced, so you don´t have lesser chances because you are not into pvp stuff. I made 10.000.000 credits in the first 24 hours by mining, producing and trading without being in a big corporation. You don´t need any fees or in game currency to develop and i reallly encourage you to try this game. Takes about an hour or two to get into the mechanics, but once you´ve been through that it´s definately getting addictive ;-)			"

												Self-starter type of game.  If a player is looking for green arrows to tell them where to go and what to do, this isn't the game for them; however, if they like to research or theory crafting, setting goals, running basic missions, and near infinite customization of the bots you'll be piloting, then it will be challenging and rewarding.Time-based skill leveling (regardless of logging in) rewards long-time players and has a tendency to off-put new players.  The development team off-sets this by giving new players a cache of skill points to use to get started.  Resetting the points require cash-shop credits, so one should research what they want to do in-game first.  The tutorial gives a great range of options of what a player can do.Official information sites need to be solidified: the official wiki is broken (http://wiki.perpetuum-online.com/index.php/Main_Page), the twitter page wasn't updated for the last hot patch, server status page wasn't updated for the last update or hot patch(http://www.perpetuum-online.com/System:Server_status).  The best place to find information is the official forums where Dev_Zoom tries to keep people updated.Many of the information sites and tools on this game are now broken links or outdated from updates/patches.  A greater player-base would help with hobby sites containing information, e.g. Perpetuum planner or Profit Reloaded.One last FYI, a large part of this game is based around PVP and the population typically isn't forthcoming with ""trade secrets"" like robot builds, money makers, etc.  A more healthy Alpha island population, with little interest in Beta/Gamma island politics, would help players get started on successful assignment completion.

												Where to begin as many people have said this is like eve the set-up and layout to the way you pilot the mechs is nearly the same.So down to what I think, as normally I don’t write reviews but this is worth one as it is a game that has gone under the radar for most, me included. My cons are greater than my pro list. But there not gaming breaking con’s more a wish list on how somethings I feel should work or could be improved a little but there current state does not ruin the game for me.Pro:Quick and easier to pick-up the mechanics are easy if you have played eve before.Good intro guide in part for new players to get there head around the game before jumping in, see con for bad part of guide.Dev’s are in-game helping people.Con:UI needs to be update for example Landmarks windows needs to let you break it down in to other windows like for missions only items or for drones only this would be of great benefit for pve and pvp.No way to skip training guide it seems and it can get boring if you just want to get in and play felt very long and could get boring for someone who has played a lot of mmo before. However as stated as a pro it is good for someone who has never played this type of game before.(Edit the above can be skipped  by going to the teleporter it turns out but right away. This should however needs to be made clear for players who are bored with the training.)They do not explain extensions very well in training or what you would need to get started properly, maybe they should offer templates after finishing the training area for what you would like to specialize in. For example a bounty hunter template will give you the basics for pvp\pve Template or a harvesting\mining Template and so on as this took a bit of time to read what I needed to get the most out of a basic pve setup.World feels a bit empty not player wise but Npc\AI bots wiseHate having to keep going back for quests one at a time and would like to take 5 combat quests at a time and just go out and do them instead of only being able to take one level 2 combat quest.Need more mech’s to choose from feels very limited on the choice of what to go in to battle with?Overall great game and worth the money and from reading the forums and seeing new and old screen shots of the game the dev’s are continuing to improve the game making it better.

												I do recommend this game but with a few conditions. you need patience in this game  everything takes time specially when you first start. for me personally the biggest annoyance is the teleport system if you want to go to the next island you can just got to the nearest teleport and pick where you want to end up you will have to travel between teleports that are not connected i think this is to give the look of scale in the islands and it does but its very annoying to me specially when i am traveling to sell resources and the like other then that i do like it and its a good relaxation game for me			"

												OK so there I am reading an EVE post about a major merc contract / Heist and in the comments one poster mentions eve online but with robots replacing spaceships....so being an EVE player for a number of years I am now interested.I jump on steam and I am pleased to see black friday is in full swing and I get Perpetuum for £6-00 now thats a great start.I do the tutorials (4 sections) then I pick my race do the avatar thing and make my character.now I have 3 robots to play with couple of lights and an assault.I jump into general chat and ask for a few tips and am instantly given some options from the player base which I thought  was a big plus for the game.I get a PM and im being invited to join a large corp who are doing all aspects of the game from pvp-pve-indy stuff so i join up, get given TS info and where the corp base from and im off teleporting around islands to meet up with my new corp.the market is very eve like there is quite a bit to learn eve style also with regards to skills and robot roles and robot fits etc corp starts a pvp op  I squad up then proceed to get lost ^^ didnt even get into the fight but corp still threw me 1mill NIC for joining the op \o/so this is the first couple of hours and im in a corp I have 1 mill NIC a home base.I think I am going to enjoy this game the more I play, the player base is small at the moment but I think this is going to change as more people join the fun.I would recommend this game it does what it intends MMO sandbox with robots as your mode.

												Very early viewpoint from a new user - Like has been said before, this game does borrow ALOT from EVE, which I played for nearly a year and probably understood about 25% of the game.  The two games are very similar in both pros and cons.  The depth and possibilities are fantastic but its a steep learning curve.  The basics are easy to master, so its quick to dive in, but more advanced combat can be difficult to grasp for new people, and the bigger global territorial pvp aspect is nearly impossible to really understand without help.  Luckily it seems to have a very helpful, if small, playerbase that seem to be mature and friendly.   The one time cost with no monthly fees makes it definately worth a shot.  I'd recommend you try.

												I fully recomend this game as a lower quality eve clone. Eve with robots. Has the same concept, similar player driven economy, combat, mining...etc. As a former eve player i adapted easily to this new game. Major downside for me so far BUT i havent played long , would be it seems i only see 16 insland with 6 of them apearing safe. Maiby im wrong and there are more . Worth 7.3 E ? YES worth more....im not too sure. If you dont like subscription based EVE and want a more casual game but with similar concepts Perpetuum is the answer. Pay once 7 E and have fun. I personaly spend 6 hours mining for a new robot while watching some movies online. Similar to what i did in EVE :D The combat is fun too. Meaning its the same as EVE very dependent on gear and ur choices of expertise. NOt reflexes well at least not that much. BUT i havent pvp ed yet. Well long story short its a smart well made eve online clone that i fully recomend for the winter sale. FUll price no. not yet.			"

												I've played for about 4 hours and so far Perpetuum is pretty fun. The tutorial sequence seems to drag on, perhaps the robot category introductions could have been condensed, but otherwise it's understandable given the amount of information there is to cover. Entering the world and doing missions is nice, especially since doing a particular type and level of mission a lot will increase the rewards for that type and level of mission. My one gripe is with the time-based upgrade currency it uses, Extension Points. According to the tutorial, these points are only accumulated once per day as long as the player is logged in once per three days. While it's nice that people who can't play much can still advance, I think it holds back players who are actually playing and doing things in the game world. Perhaps the research system is the balance to that, but I haven't had much opportunity to play with that (and I blew all my starter EP on unlocking robot categories and improving reactor and accumulation capacities).

												Even though I only have 25 hours of play time so far in Perpetuum, I can say it feels like the game I have been looking for for a long time. It has it all, pvp, pve, crafting, a player controlled market, a very good community feel, and a wonderful look to the graphics. If you have played EVE you will get a feel for how this game works straight away, but being a bittervet is NOT a requirement to enjoy Perpetuum! There is crafting, a deep and complex system I have not even scratched the surface of, and resource gathering is interactive and absorbing. The combat is also something I am only just getting into - I have been focussing so far on gathering - but it feels and looks rewarding and fun. The ""levelling"" here is aka EVE too, you assign points to ""Extensions"" to boost various attributes or parts of your robot (did I say you are a consciousness controlling a robot via a miniature wormhole? Very cool premise to this game!), but in this game you accrue Extension Points daily, and assign as you want. This is a pvp sandbox, so combat in certain zones is inevitable if not mandatory, but I am looking forward to it:) This game has a lot of similarities to EVE, but it is not EVE, it is it's only animal and stands apart from its more well known Icelandic relative. The dev team here seem friendly, and the small but dedicated fan base certainly are friendly and helpful. You do not need to buy the upgrades, but it will give you a leg up in terms of EPs, however due to the nature of EP accrual, new players will catch up with veterans soon enough. This is a game where the long view of things is needed, but honestly that is a good thing in this day of ""rush to the end game and move on"" gaming. I really do urge you to get this game - B2P and worth it even if you miss one of the frequent sales. Hope to see you soon on Nia!			"

The lack of player base is a big issue as the PVE get boring and repedative quite quickly, but they are trying to address these issues now.The game has never fully grabbed me and kept me for more than a month or so but I still enjoy playing every now and again and now its a pay once game thats not really too much of an issue.I hear the price is going to be dropping, and for £10 you gotta give it a go, even if it only grabs you for a month or so you've got more than you moneys worth.

												I have been playing Perpetuum Online for many years.  This game really shines in large scale PVP warfare.  Even with hundreds of battles under my belt being the Fleet Commander, Ewar Captain, DPS Lead, or cog in the wheel in a pack of mechs I still get goose bumps when we engage in battle.  The combat is heavily dependent on terrain, skill and overall situational awareness.  There is no point, click, and wait.  You are on your toes 100% of the time and mistakes can cost you a fleet.Small gang pvp 3 to 5 players is super fun with gorilla style tactics allowing you to move practically undetected through islands to find a target and strike.  Rewards from the mini game of capture the flag on SAP warfare for stations can cover the lose of many, many bots and modules.  The Bold are rewarded.Industry in this game is like Crack.  I'm not going to lie, once you get sunk into it with the level headed ness of the system it really is a no brainer and fun to watch those factory lines ping.  You can produce at ANY station, you can gather what you need in the surrounding areas in a complex manner of finding ore fields and extracting them from the ground.  Plants on terrain are harvestable too.  There is NO RANDOM PROCS on industry, it is spreadsheet friendly and the market isn't completely convoluted with who can sell it first.  Best of all No subscription.  You buy it, log in every 3 days you get EP.  I've spent more money on a bad acid trip.  You'll spend hours being immersed in a planet that is utterly amazing.  Is this a FPS?  No.  This is a lock, acquire and shoot type MMO.  It provides a level playing field for older players who feel they can't compete with twitch based gamers.  It's a great game to add to the collection and the community is small enough to join in and be something.  So your not a 1 in 1 Million type customer who thinks his $ is thrown at a developer to be forgotten, your voice on the forums really helps.  Contact me in game as Ville if you have any questions.Edit: 12/10/14 :  I have dropped this game as a recommended game.  The server Lag, the patch and the down right arrogance of the game have called a pitfall of a♥♥♥♥♥♥storm.  The game is in a state of pitiful decay and its rapidly sinking.  Population is creepy back into the teens in the US timezone(yes I said Teens like 15 ♥♥♥♥ing people, for a mmo)  -The Patch:  Instead of giving the players new content they decided to straight nerf the game by 20%.  Reducing extensions from 50% to 30%.  They did not factor in to the equation the modules accumulator consumptions/NPCing/and industry.  THEY DID NOT GIVE PLAYERS AN EP RESET.  I repeat they dropped a patch that completely changed the entire dynamic of play and did not refund players who had YEARS invested into accounts.  Some became utterly useless over night.  One bot is called an ictus which had its 80% bonus reduced to 30% and completely removed its use in combat pvp.The players have started numerous threads about how terrible the patch is.  Many have moved on to other games and only a handful still hold hope to it.  The developers have stubbed their noses at the very through analysis done by the players as to why this is a terrible patch.  The patch completely shifted pvp style to a guerilla warfare type pvp engagements where DPS style robots can basically not be tackled.  Light ewars use in the game was removed because the accumulator cap is being eaten alive by running 1 module.  Allowing the DPS bots plenty of room to get one or two shots off on them before they are killed.NPC farming took a direct hit by 20% (DPS from 50% to 30% bonus)followed by the patch that made the npcs directly agro boaster bots to the combats and never drop agro, even on alpha.  So farming now takes 20% longer.-Lag Game crippling lag during PVP that the developers imagine is not there.  There are people in game who have live streamed themselves warp around.  It makes it next to impossible to pvp and its very very frustrating.   And still its being dismissed as ""not our problem"".I can't even harvest my expensive plants(noralgis) which I lost 75 Million NIC on those plants because I lag so hard around them it kills the plants because I over harvest them.

												Short version - it's EVE Online on the ground with robots instead of spaceships.  If you like EVE, you should like this game.With that said, unlike EVE, there's no interdictors waiting for you after you change maps, so that's a definate plus.  You also get several seconds of immunity during map changes until you move your robot or activate a system.  There's no montlhly fee, but you can get 1.5x skill points per day if you decide it's worth it.  If you don't, as long as you log in to one of your characters once every three days, you still get your points.  Userbase seems small because most players aren't on any of the general chats, and mainly stick to their own corperation chat.  The people that are, though, are generally helpful and accomidating to noobs.   The tutorial is long, but answers most questions new players should have, plus you get some free stuff from doing all of it.  What corp you pick at the start determines your starting location and what bots you get from the tutorial, if you did it.  There are a few things that might put you off to the game.  Such as it's similar to EVE Online.  Which means that the same targeting system is in as well.  Spend several seconds for a lock, then pray to the RNG gods that your attack hits.  I've had missiles somehow land well behind and to the right of the target, despite both robots standing still on a flat terrain.  The graphics sorely need an update.  Yes, it will run on a toaster, but for people who have bought a video card within the past couple years, the game could look so much better.  Even a few tweaks like having the sun position update more than once every few hours, and have fog roll in and out of an area instead of suddenly on or off would help greatly.			"

												Perpetuum is an amazing game for how young it is, it's pretty fun and exciting to explore and see how much trouble you can get in and survive. it does have its problems though. I personally experience frequent latency issues and get disconnected a lot, and at the worst possible times. I've lost 3 machines simply due to losing connection during a firefight. yes, death in the game does not greet you with a respawn or 'find your corpse' like WoW. if you die, you lose everything you went out into the field with. not at all a bad thing, in fact I like that! death finally has a meaning in a game!something I don't like is that credits for upgrading extentions requires not effort, but time spent. this means you can do little to progress except wait. storage capacity in the field is extremely low if you're in a combat machine and alone. the selection of robots is also limited but I imagine there is more to come in the future I hope. the learning curve is also somewhat steep but that's only because this game has incredible depth outside of combat, blowing stuff up is only a small part of the game. what I do like is how much equipment there is. even if you don't get to build your own machine or even customize its appearance at all, you can still change the loadout quite a bit. there's a lot of teamwork involved especially if you want to target bigger game, or survive packs of smaller enemies. this game has a bad habit of spawning enemies right as you finish the last of a group and have low health, ultimately forcing you to sprint for your life or die trying since enemies here are VERY unforgiving even after they die. they'll just come back in a few minutes with full agro. it's very challenging indeed. overall this game has great potential so I'll stick with it for the long haul and see how it grows, but right now I'm finding it difficult to find good things to say about it. it feels so empty still, I can't quite put my finger on what bugs me the most but the devs are working hard to turn perpetuum into an amazing game and I want to be there to see it along.if you like sandbox games, gunfights, mechs, earning money in and out of combat, exploring, and being a part of a community, this game is well worth it.

												If you enjoy Eve Online, you will enjoy PerpetuumIt has the best EVE game mechanics:-Weapons with different energy consumptions and ranges-Factions with specific armor resistance profiles (along with hardeners for damage resists)-A Player based economy with resource gathering at its base-Passive character progression-Intricate fitting to balance dps, tank, cpu and shield consumption, and e-war-Scanning for artifacts, and looking for elite npcs that drop high end modules-PvP on both a small and large (though not EVE 2k vs 2k, though I cant say I ever enjoyed those)It is however not as polished off as Eve online especially in atmosphere and the smaller touches. The exploration is also not quite as intricate as EVE online's latest updates. There is also a much smaller selection of Bots, though they have higher tech variants.That said it is a lot faster than eve online. You dont go into a mission and then treck for 4 minutes to the next jump gate. The mission waypoints are a bit closer and you actually travel the map area, not a locked away bubble made just for the mission.I'd deffinately recommend it to anyone looking for break from EVE or simply an alternative with less pressure to play as there is no monthly sub.If you'd like an idea of jsut how much it is like eve, google ""Zortargs guide to perpetuum"" for a bunch of info sheets on game mechanics.

												First thing I want to point out is that I have never played EVE Online. So this review comes from someone who did not know the feel of this kind of game.  When buying this game three are some things that you need to know:1. This game does not slowly put you into the massive amount of information required to feel confident in doing anything in the game. It has probably the worst tutorial I have ever played. It will require patients to learn this game.2. There is no best starting choice and you can eventually do and have everything. Pick the faction that sounds the most fun. They give you temporary super bots at the end of the tutorial. Just pick the coolest one.3. This is designed for group play. You need to join player corporation. These will have access to tech that you would have to spend lots of time on your own to get and you will go from feeling like you can't do much to being able to get right into things (combat, harvesting, or w/e)What I like about this game is that I don't always have the time to do things, but my charicter gains expeirence through time not grinding. The level grind is boring to me. The only ""grinding"" in this game is for money/items which I am perfectly fine with.			"

												My first impression of this game is that it looks like EVE online.For me, that's allright, because I liked Eve. The big difference with Eve, is that you control robots, instead of spaceships.That's a nice change of looks, and you have a lot more control of movement at your disposal.A big pro to this game is that it has no subscription based system ( any more ).A negative could be the outdated graphics, but that doesn't really bother me.If I want to play a game with amazing graphics, I'll play the witcher 3 or something alike.In this game, the mechanics are what's pulling me in the game.I do like fitting my robots, like I did with Eve's spaceships.I understand the Assignments (quests ) part of the game did get a complete overhaul in one ofthe latest patches. While I haven't done very much assignments yet, the combat ones that I did weren't too hard at tier 0,but at tier 1, with a newbie robot, they are fun and challenging. I am still exploring the other aspects of the game, while mining and combatting npc's.I haven't seen a lot of the community till now, but the ones I did see, where really helpfull if you ask them something.I m gonna try out the production part next.hope to see you all ingame!

												A new players first impressionAfter chewing threw the Tutorial and then doing a few missions, I've summised that Perpetuum is very similar to EvE Online, albeit you control a robot rather than a spaceship. The targeting systems, menus and general gameplay are mostly similar.This is both Positive and Negative.The positive side is that you can quickly familiarise yourself with the basics and flow of the game.Negative being that it doesn't feel different, and a lot more 'rough' than its comparable partner. I'll just reel off a few impressions:- The tutorial is very informative, which is often overlooked and gives you a great start.- Outside of the tutorial the game gives you nothing. Other than here are missions, go. - Graphics are pretty basic, and generally not pleasing. - Game provides a great time sink aswell easy to dip in and out of - with things not requiring large investments of time, due to the EP system. Overall, its a fairly solid game - a good F2P alternative for people who are interested in EvE or no longer wish to play subscrition based games.I will give it a 6.5/10 Down to the empty player base and the fact that once you finish the tutorial you are given no direction			"

Once the introduction was done and megacorp chosen , entering the world and not having the faintest clue what to do was actually quite fun :)  Once I figured out how to start assignments I'm starting to get a hang of it ( a little bit ).   Only having played a couple of hours I can't give an in-depth review, but so far it's well worth the money  taking me well out of my gaming comfort zone and making me have to use my brain for a change.

												Perpetuum seems to be one of the 'successors' to Eve Online. It is a game of Robots instead of ships, and the familiarity will be a bonus to people who have played Eve Online with a few exceptions. For one, skills are no longer time based, but point based. Meaning you don't have to wait around endlessly while a skill is being trained. In the same vein, however, your points are daily. Meaning that you only get a limited number of points per day to which to spend on 'extensions' or skills in Eve.The biggest plus for me, at any rate, is the fact there is a PvP flag. Meaning that you can't be killed as you wander the islands randomly. There are probably spots where the PvP is automatically set to PvP, but I can live with that. I don't have to worry about my beginning mech being blown to pieces because a higher skilled player got a bee in their bonnet and decided my little inventory scraps are worth killing over.			"

								This game is honestly great. Sadly as of now there arent alot of robots to chosse from but they are a good little bunch to have. The player base is nice and helpful and the gamma islands will be relased soon. More then likely brining back almost all the player pop back cause from what ive been told that is what everyone is waiting for.The gameplay is great even tho the missions can get a little repetative but combat system is great with a decent cover based system.You can use the landscape to your advantage in combat to either help you or to kill you.I highly reconmmend this game as if you were into games like EvE online this game is fantastic for you.

								All I can say is this game has huge potential, it's not as good looking as some games out there but with propper funding it can look breathtaking!The fludity of the world is emersive and the game play slow just like time based games, eve online springs to mind after spending nearly 4 years with CCP before selling my account. Perpetuum is not to be taken as a subsitute, they are completely different games even thought they have remarkable similarities.  This game does however take world generation and terraforming to a new high, the level of customisation is fantastic. PvP can be tense too, being in and finding a group of people to play with will always make a difference to how the game works for you. I am going to leave this comment with the motion for you to try this game, if you have patience and like to reap the rewards of a time based game, you should try this game considering it is no longer Subscriptin based. If you really want to speed up generated experiance points you can pay real money for boosters if you want to, but considering they come in at 1 EP per minute I never see the point. All in all this game is a hidden gem in the MMO arena.			"

												Very sandboxy MMO which forces you to think for yourself. Once out of the tutorial, you are completely free to do what you decide and the only limits are your choices. The devs are dedicated and while the game has a small community, it is what makes it so exclusive and enjoyable. The tutorial is extremely helpful and teaches everything you need to know, but different parts of it are completely optional. Give the game at least 2 hours and you will understand enough to enjoy it.			"

								It plays like EVE but with greater enagement on postioning for fighting. You have to keep a clean LOS or your shots will hit obstructions. There is a sub if you wish to keep accumulating skill points after being away from the game for 3 days. The sub lets you accumulate 50% more skill points daily for 30 days, seems like a great investment and value. Lag is sometimes an issue, you fire when you think you have a clean shot only to watch it blast away an a seemingly inoffensive wall, but they are relocating servers as of June '14 to help with this issue.

												This game is solid.  Its EVE Online with big stompy robots, what's not to like?  Getting used to the interface is pretty easy if you have played EVE, it is very similar.  Adding this game to steam and lowering the price has caused a population boom, which is very welcome.All in all, a  very fun, and very futuristic game that reminds me of the Sci-Fi novel Great Sky River in a lot of ways.I wish they would develop the back story and fiction further, however, the concept is pretty solid.

												-- The Pepsi to EVE Online's Coke --Have you ever played EVE Online?  Then you'll immediately recognize this game.  This is not a bad thoing though.  What I like is the lack of monthly subscription, so if you liked EVE and wanted to be a more casual or passive player but were discouraged by paying for it monthly, this could be for you.I can't personally speak for the PvP, though, since I'm definitely the mining/harvesting sort, but I can say I'm happy with the gathering mechanics at least.

												Excellent Game, wish I had found this long ago! Things Id like to see in the game future, 1. Lites! lites would be so sweet to see all the little bots performing tasks at night, and would create some sweet shadows. More physical customization to the equipt robots. Banners, graphics, Component colors. A repair side kick, little guy, pet if you will, collectible. Maybe a texture overhaul, and lastly LOT LOTS LOTS more players so come on! Try it out!I will say this to potential new players, please be very patient, I almost gave up on it. The tutorial is quite long but you get basic knowledge that you NEED to have to scratch the surface. I did the tutorial twice on a second Character, everything was much easier second time. Also you get some excellent rewards including Robots! Next I decided I would just run around and Mine, Harvest, Explore to start out. I got very frustrated trying to figure out my modules, scanners, locations etc. (This is why I did tutorial again) but my point is don't be afraid to get some guns on and run around and kill stuff, the initial robot is replaceable, make sure you choose a home terminal for it, and have insurance if your taking out one of the upgraded robots. Keep in mind that all your Extensions (upgrades) remain across the board for future robots so don't get to caught up in what your next robot will be because you wont start over with that at least. Only second day but hope this helps you to decide to try it out, its pretty sweet.			"

												Perpetuum is a game which has evolved nicely over the years. It is alot like EvE online in many ways, with the diverse areas of gameplay like PVE missions, fitting, time based progression, industry, trading, mining, warfare, politics, base building, research, PVP, clans etc. The graphical features and game engine are a bit dated but the art is still good and does a good job of making the world feel extra-terrestrial. The music is also unique and fits well with this game. The robots and mechs are pretty cool and have modules in a similar fashion to eve such as lasers,  ballistics, kinematics, magneto-statics, and missiles. The world has been going through a pretty major overhaul over the past year with random missions assignments, roaming mobs, localized combat stations and a lot more I can't name off the top of my head. In some way this game is better than EvE for new players, as it has not had over a decade of expansions roll out and such a massive disparity in progression. The biggest problem Perpetuum has is playerbase, right now the game is suffering from a low population, however that means it is a good time to get out there and take advantage the situation. You got to look at a game like this as a long term endeavor. It will take years to get high level skills and master multiple modes of play. It does not require constant attention either, so if you are like me and play dozens of games you can get sidetracked and come back after a few weeks and have a ton of skill points to blow.Lastly I would comment on the monetization. The game is B2P and totally playable without a subscription boost, you just need to log in for at least a  few seconds every three days to refresh your skill point generation. The sub system works from subtracting game credits and it works out to less than $10 per month. There is also a Plex type system(ICE) that you can use for the booster or to trade for NIC(credits). Compared to most MMO's your dollars will go alot farther if you choose to spend. I recommend this game for anyone looking for a game that has some depth and complexity to it and is more tactical than tactile. It is less top heavy than EvE but is modelled after some of the same design aspects. This game is ripe for new players to come in. At its core Perpetuum is a game about robotic gun platforms on a distant alien world some of which are alien(NPC) and some which are controlled remotely by human players(you).			"

												I just installed this game yesterday and played a little and I want to write my first impressions of the game. I love it! :)I was scared that I would not understand anything the game being compared to Eve a lot of times, but the tutorial is very nicely made and it covers all the points of the game. So now I am just very little lost after being teleported to main game from the tutorial island. I know how to mine and refine end even manufacture, the missions are easy when you take the first ones. The travel mission was a little bit frustrating as it is hard to find the corect path between the travel points, but I liked it more like this as it is not boring just going from one place to another in a straight line. I did not yet explore but the surroundings of the terminal I was teleported to and caanot say much of the depth of the game, but after the tutorial my impression of the game is very good. I will continue to play it and hopefully also find a corporation to join :)10/10 thumbs up and keep it going !			"

												I have been on the fence for a while about purchasing the game, but the real incentive for me to buy it was the great price-point and the lack of monthly subscription fees.  If you have read much about the game, the gameplay and mechanics are very similar to EVE online. Unfortunately, the main complaint you will come across is the low population community.  Given the sandbox nature of the game, that can be an issue as player-driven content is severely limited.That being said, I was also looking for a game I can passively play while accomplishing other work simultaneously.  So if you are interested in the same criteria as I am, open-world mmo, single shard server, sci-fi, player-driven economy, and passive gameplay, then take the leap and buy the game.  Can't go wrong at this price.			"

												This is Eve Online with robots (Mechs)  instead of spaceships, on planet surface instead of space. And with one big advantage. NO SUBSCRIPTIONS! Do I recomend it? YES!! Especially now with the price drop (9.99€) which is cheaper than a monthly subsription for most MMOs you buy the game once and play free forever. PROSEve Online playstyle and mechanics. If you are/was an Eve player, you will be right at home.Sandbox gameplay. Play the way you want. Miner, Trader, Manufacturer, Mission Runner, Pirate, name it and you can do it.Player driven economy. All items even your mechs are manufactured from the players and their prices depends from offer & demand market rule.Mechs! How can you say no to the opportunity to pilot and fight with your own Mech?No subscription! One time buy (only 9.99€) and you play it free for ever!CONSNot so big player base. Game needs more players. I hope now with the price drop, playerbase will be biger and biger.ConclusionDo I recomend this game? YES! If you are/was an Eve Online player or just like sandbox, player driven economy/politics open games, don't miss it!			"

												Having played Eve in its infancy i can see a lot of what was available there in this game.Industry and Manufacturing is quite complex, interesting, and satisfying.Combat is similar to eve and features Gauss weapons, Lasers, Missisles, and EWar.Fitting is exactly like \EveThe interface is like EveResearch system is vast and interesting.Skill training is similar to eve but differs in a good way, daily you are allotted points that you can spend on your various skills instead of setting a skill and letting it train. You are allowed to not log in up to 3 days and still collect your accumulated points. You can pay what equates to a monthly fee to increase this allotment by 50% and do away with the accumulation cap of 3 days.The game is regularly updated and does not require a monthly subscription, what more could you ask for?All in all, if you like Eve then you will like this game.

												Perpetuum seems to be one of the 'successors' to Eve Online. It is a game of Robots instead of ships, and the familiarity will be a bonus to people who have played Eve Online with a few exceptions. For one, skills are no longer time based, but point based. Meaning you don't have to wait around endlessly while a skill is being trained. In the same vein, however, your points are daily. Meaning that you only get a limited number of points per day to which to spend on 'extensions' or skills in Eve.The biggest plus for me, at any rate, is the fact there is a PvP flag. Meaning that you can't be killed as you wander the islands randomly. There are probably spots where the PvP is automatically set to PvP, but I can live with that. I don't have to worry about my beginning mech being blown to pieces because a higher skilled player got a bee in their bonnet and decided my little inventory scraps are worth killing over.			"

								If you have played EVE Online you will be familiar with many similar functions; the game works on a very similar template, including an equivalent to skill points over time. That said, there is a distinctly different feel to Perpetuum, and its a more comfortable one. Destroy npcs, destroy each other, mine, manufacture, research and develop, trade, mission, and so on - theres plenty to do even at an early stage. The controls are tight feeling (none of that perpetual lag feeling some mmos have like a constant, bitter after-taste).  Devs are active and there is almost always one online. Community is small, but growing, and diverse in spite of it's size. Its a pay once, play forever model currently, but no pay to win mechanics either (though a equivalent $10/mo sub will give 50% more passive skill points per day).  I highly recommend giving this one a try, particularly if you have any history with EVE (and enjoyed something in it).			"

								The best alternative to EVE Online on the market! (Except you control robots on the ground instead of ships in space :P)The game is complex but not too annoying to learn, economy is fully driven by players in persistent, single-shard world consisting of 12 massive islands. Also available manufacturing on small and large scale, intercorporational politics and big pvp encounters. Combat is way more fun than EVE's 3 dimensional nausea as everything happens on the ground (rules of the combat are clear). Ever changing world that you can shape by terraforming whole islands and building own facilities. Also best game to play while playing other games(for slowpaced miners :)The only flaw is rather small community which hopefully will grow now as game has landed on Steam. Also graphically it might not suit everyone as it's rather dated(though gonna be probably updated at some point)Much recommended!			"

												I have never been a big fan of sci fi games, and this game as got me hooked. I'll start with the cons:Cons:There were one or two moments which I almost quit the game. This was in the tutorial. So much text to read, and I don't like reading essays, even though you probably should to start to get a grasp for the game. But I buckled down and read the heavy amounts of text, until 1 point where I had read the whole page of text and it didnt not tell me how I should focus a tile. Double clicking wasnt working, and many other things werent either. So I read and reread this large block of text. Nothing/ I got extreemly frustrated and almost quit the game right then and there. Help chat was very good, except for 1♥♥♥♥♥who decided to respond to me with read the text.... For the most part help chat is very good. There is no fast travel or moving all your♥♥♥♥♥♥from one terminal to another, which isnt the end of the world. But maybe a slight hassle if youre moving bases or you have stuff spread out. I started Industrial so I already had a hauler. But I can see this being very very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for people who dont have a hauler and need to buy one.Pros:COMMUNITY! I ahve not gotten into a fairly copmlex game, and had so much people offer help, and talk to each other. Even though there might not be, it feels like 100s or thousands of players are ready to help you. Yesterday I joined a corporation where a guy spend over 2 hrs explaning mechanics to a fellow newbie. I decided to be a miner, I have no clue why I am having so much fun watching my robot mine and completing mining missions!! But it is really compeling.Very large crafting system, that take time to unlock.Very nice and intricate talent tree (extensions).Overall, I've stopped playing over 5-6 games, and am just hooked on this game, even though I never play sci-fi games.

Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let's get into ""why"" you should.Perpetuum is a very interesting and deep game that you will hopefully spend many hours playing. There is so much that game offers you from mining/harvesting materials to crafting various commodities to running various assignments for different factions to base building to combat... The only true limit is your imagination (and the time and NIC you are willing to invest). Taking the time to plan out and finally outfit the perfect combat robot you have been hoping for, hopping from island to island to make that next big sale, or sneaking around an island full of hostile enemy players hoping to find that next big artifact stash is a lot of fun, especially when you take the time to invest in both your skills and your gear.""But running missions and gathering materials is boring, and fighting enemies is either too easy or too hard!"" Please ask yourself - what is it I really want to do in Perpetuum? Do I want to build large bases in the PvP islands, fight enemy corporations, or maybe even collaborate with other players to corner the market and make a ton of money together? Whatever the answer, you will probably want to join a player corporation that has similar goals. Not only that, but you'll hopefully find a group of interesting and fun people to play with; and don't think you are limited to just talking to your fellow corp members! Not only can you create your own chat channels, but there are global channels like General Chat and Help Chat as well. You are in control of what you want to do in this game.""But I hear that there is a low player population - what does that mean for me coming into the game?"" This is another valid concern; after all, who wants to shell out their hard-earned money for something and not have fun? Steam statistics are only one way of seeing part of the game population online at a given time, and you are able to leave any chat channel except for you corporation's channel and either the terminal or vicinity channel for the island that you are in or on. As such, it will look as though there aren't many people on. At the same time if you are interested in the game, hopefully you will try the game out, find something that interests you and maybe either get your friends to play or find a group of players to hang out with in-game. The population problem is something that needs to be addressed, but we can't address it of you aren't playing with us!""But what about the community? Are they mean? Salty? Tell me more!"" Well, in my time playing the game I've seen General Chat be very quiet for a decent period of time, then someone speak up and everything begins to cascade from there (usually). People are mostly very helpful and pleasant to either speak with or joke around with - always feel free to ask questions! Are people going to respond every time you say hi? Probably not. But the longer you are on the more players you will run into and in turn the more opportunities you will have to talk to people who have similar interests, senses of humor, etc. I lucked out when I joined my first corp, and I hope that you do to!""The whole daily allocation of extension points (EP) thing turns me off."" Okay, I won't argue that this is a more niche game in that sense. A lot of MMOs out there certainly let you level at your own pace and ultimately hit a maximum power level. But if someone has spent the time investing in a particular skillset in Perpetuum, they are doing so because they are interested in it. That also means that they probably aren't good in other areas of the game. You are able to respecialize your character (for an amount of paid-for currency relative to how many skills you want to retrain and the levels of those skills), but you hopefully will start out with an idea of what interests you and only need to make minor alterations or pursue new skill areas moving forward. You can (almost) totally wipe the slate clean if you wish to too (you cannot respecialize your initially spent extension points, so DO choose those wisely!). If you want to gain EP at a faster rate, there is always the option of either buying ICE (basically a 50% EP booster for 30 days that also does not require you to log in every 3 days to receive EP) via the cash shop or via in-game NIC on the market.""Wait, I have to log in every three days?"" Well, yes. Here is why: the log-in system, just like the skill (extension) system is meant to encourage long-term play. It is a good way to encourage community participation and growth, especially since this is not a subscription-based game. Hopefully our logging in every few days will keep us playing, facilitate us meeting new people. keep the in-game market running, cause new player-run events to happen...I sincerely hope that you come visit Nia and the rest of us Perpetuum players. I don't want to make it sound as though I want to justify the game despite its faults (and let's be honest for a moment, all games have them), but hopefully give you a different insight into what you might expect should you purchase this game. There aren't many games like this out there, and provided that this is the sort of game that might interest you, I really think you might enjoy it!P.S.: I would like to make a special mention of the Upgrade Kit DLCs, if only because they did give me a headstart, not only with the EP provided but some of the items from the AID devices being able to purchase a couple months of ICE bought with the credits included. If you play the game for a while and want that extra boost, or want to start off strong when you make your first character, check them out!			"

								Nice game to slowly work up on over time. You can lose all your bots, losing has more consequences.The market is almost entirely player driven (Players make stuff and sell it, which you can buy)You can also make almost everything yourselfIf you are looking for a fast game it might not be for you.

								I bought this sincerely hoping to get eve online but with mechs  and using WASD to move. i got eve online with mechs and using WASD to move. plus theres no subs and the skill queue system is a little easier to work with if you cant log in every day, you accumulate points instead of a timer based system and you only need to log in once every 3 days to keep points accumulating, unless u pay the 10 bucks a month in which case you get double skill points and dont have to log in at all. all round im having great fun with this so far.

												Random notes while playing this game./__Critiques__\-While in-depth, the tutorial is obnoxiously long.-UI is terrible. Way too much going on that requires way too much effort to bring up and arrange.-Using equipment is way too over-complicated.-Combat is slow and very awkward.-Targeting itself is very slow.-Attacking by either using the interface in the UI or hitting the space is unresponsive at times.-29 people online total that I counted from the chats- and no one is even active.-With combat and movement itself: the camera is in need of a lock feature at least.-A lot of small details are in place, but it is all executed poorly.-Trailor depicts an action fest. This game is definitely not like that./__Personal Observations__\-I fell asleep while playing this game because of how dry the experience was.-The game feels like more of a chore than it is fun. This is a deal breaker for me with any game./__Good Things__\-Nice soundtrack that is befitting.-Game runs smooth. No optimization issues.			"

												I do not write reccomendations that much, but i think this game deserves one. I played a few days when it was still in it's early stages. When i played it had a very famililiar feeling, because it had the same feeling and setup as a great game called EVE - Online.  Although in a different setting and somewhat different playstyle it is a very good substitute. Atm i'm at the start of the game so have not done that much yet but you as far as i can see you can do all sorts of things in the game. If you are intrested in EVE but are not willing to pay a monthly subscription fee I can definitly reccomend Perpetuum. The game can definitly use more players but give it time and the player base will grow. The developers are still developing the game further as we speak. I have not really been keeping an eye out on how fast and how well they listen to the public, but if I believe the ingame chats and other reviews they are definitly going good and take reccomendations at heart.

												Keep in mind, this game is very E.V.E.-like, and I am not a fan of that type of game.I knew this game was E.V.E.-like. I bought it anyways because some of the gameplay looked fun. It honestly does look, and sound, fun. It's just executed so poorly.The tutorial takes about an hour, there is way too much to learn at the beginning, It's overwhelming, and that turns off a lot of players, including myself. The UI is bad. It's like playing Tetris, not with your inventory like Diablo, but with all the windows you have to manage. Not 2D tetris, either. 3D Tetris, so you have to know what window is behind what. The fighting is simple and boring, though LOOKS interesting in gameplay videos. You just click on a gun, and that weapon fires. Or, press Space to fire all weapons.The animations and textures are one of the more disappointing things about this game. It looks like a game that my Grandma could play on her 5 year old store-bought PC. Unfortunately, it runs like Crysis 2 would, on said store-bought, 5 year-old PC. The animations are poor. Watching a robot walk around makes me cringe, because they don't step... They slide. Their feet might make the motion of stepping, but they just slide across the floor...The movement is worse than anything else. You don't FEEL like a robot. You can go from facing right to facing left INSTANTLY. No side-stepping, no turn animation, you just snap to that direction and go. It's horrible! I want to feel like I'm a powerful robot, or a nimble robot, or a big, heavy mining robot. But, no. You just snap directions, and go about your day. No matter what design you have, the robot's movement is poorly animated and feels way to fast to turn directions.Overall, I'd give this game like a 3/10. It seems like it would be fun, if things were executed a bit differently. A game like HAWKEN got the movement for mechs right. The stomping, the independent movement of the torso, etc... I just think this game needs more work.I'll never be coming back, to play this game.			"

												First I want to say that this game is not an easy grind for a week or two and you can start working on getting the best gear. But this game has its rewards for your time invested, it separate the lazy want everything handed to you kids from the REAL GAMERS, those that commit to a game and stick with it for years not just a few months once they get bored of the end game.This game does take a good amount of time to learn, but if you've played Eve online you're already going to know a large amount of how things run just need to learn the games twist of how the function works. Perpetuum still could use some work but it is a smooth game, nothing that will make or break you. My own issue with perpetuum so far is, its a little rough on the eyes as theres a lot of small things moving around that your eyes are trying to focus on at once. A dev said they're working an a new UI so it shouldnt be an issue for to much longer. So, if you like robots, player driven market, keeping what you kill, or being the guy supplying the bots being blown up on the battle field then this is the game for you. Yes you will start out with next to nothing, but if you use your head. You will make more then enough game currency to support your game play of choice. I'd give Perpetuum a 8 out of 10 due to the strain it has on the players eyes, the graphics are great just to may little things for the eye to focus on at once. The games 75% off, the price of a large coffee at starbucks which will only last you an hour or two while this game will last you years.Look up Knoxie ingame and we can tackle this beast together one day at a time.

								If you like sandbox types of game this might be one of the cheaper ones to get into. For a flat fee you can play for as long as the servers remain online. No monthly subscription fees. It feels almost like a direct clone from EVE except you are planet based and mech based instead of space and ship based. Like most sandbox games though there is much lacking in the way of an introduction especially if you are foolish enough to skip the tutorial mode.  I've only recently begun to play the game but it seems easy enough, I just need to find the time to devout to this game instead of all of the others.			"

												I will say this first: If you played EVE Online for at least a few months, there is a much less steep learning curve. Though changes are slot to come out and can be buggy as all hell, they respond to the tickets they get about the bugs with a small patch. Usually within 24 hours. This is a game that has been around for quite some time and could use a asthetic facelift,The positive side to things is that if you get in with the right corp, you can get access to Beta Islands (Open PvP with outposts, all but 1 of which a corp can take over and control), and out to the Gamma Islands that have been added back (Open PvP with no outposts other than the ones that players build). Certain materials/plants can only be gathered on Beta or Gamma islands.The negative side is that there are only two major corporate alliances. that control all the Beta and Gamma islands. They tend to shoot you first and never question you about your intent on their island. So you've got to be weary of that.Find out which corporate alliance is which and what they have to offer and how they'll treat you. One is overrun with players who've been playing for so long that they have the best robots and best modules, more NIC than they know what to do with, and several backups of the best robots and best modules all over the islands.I do like that it's open-ended, though. If you were to ask what the end-game is some would say that it's PvP, some would say that it's getting into a corp with a Beta Outpost, some would say it's getting into a corp with a Gamma Outpost, and others would say that it's whatever you want it to be. Specialize in combat and do PvE and PvP. Mining minerals or harvesting plants can pay very well, depending on the buy orders in various Alpha islands.I am in a corp that ended up allying with the wrong group. They were demanding, arrogant, and treated our leadership like they were just a figurehead in a dummy corp. It fell apart, but a few months later, it reformed and we have a Beta Outpost and a Gamma Base built. Our people are friendly and offer advice or front you bots/modules/NIC to get you started. We never ask for anything in return other than you being willing to help out new people like you were helped out.Speaking of joining a chat channel, that segues into the tutorial. It's very informative but it's a lot of information that you won't really appreciate or fully grasp right out of the gate. That's really not something that can be helped. It would be nice if you could skip the tutorial, because I have more than one account, but I've done it often enough I know where everything is and can speed through it.You can see what corporations a character has been part of in the past and for how long, but all they have to do is start a new character on their account and use it to spy. That's probably one of the biggest issues. ""All is fair in love and war"" but the ease of how a spy can slip a dummy character into a corporation and there be no way to tell, is a bit ridiculous, really. Putting the names of what characters created on that account and what corporation they've been in or are in they've had in the past would cut down on the easy way to set a spy in with another corp. If it's going to be possible to create a spy character then it should at least time some sort of skill to do it.Extensions (skills) are increased over time with 1 point per minute every 24 hours (1440 minutes in a day = 1440 EP/day).I've been around since it launched on Steam (about 1.75 years ago) and I still enjoy it. I enjoy mining. It relaxes me. Do I do things on PvP islands? Heck yeah! I spend a good deal of my time on Beta and Gamma islands and I'm not into PvP. I've lost a few bots to other plays and to NPCs. But, it's just a game. So after a few hours break most people have calmed down enough to just accept that it's happened and move on. They've recently redone the Alpha 1 and Alpha 2 islands, both in looks and a different way of doing missions (for NIC and sometimes a module or bot upgrade and tokens to purchase the racial ""PvP ammo"" or Beacons, you'll learn about those if you pay).The pathing script needs work because your bot will take the shortest overland route without regard to speed boosts from Accelerator Srips (aka ""Highways"") and Teleporters. Also, the NPC behavior is in many ways quite boring and predictable but can be very frustrating and evil (in a good way). You get zerged if you don't kill them fast enough or run away (Alpha 1 islands) , you don't aggro the whole group when you kill one (Alpha 2 & Beta Islands), or they do hit and run waves of skirmish tactics (Gamma islands).Summary:Is it pefect? No, but they are working on it.Is it fun? That depends on what you find fun but I still love it.Is it worth the price for 1 account to play it and see if you like it? Yeah. Some people play it for a few days or a few weeks and then just stop playing. Others stick around and get things going themselves.I would recommend that you at least give it a chance. You won't learn everything on the first day. Be patient and choose who's company you keep carefully.			"

												Just started. Intresting ideas and complex for an mmo with Rock-Paper-Scissor combat. Leveling (if you call it that) is done on an account per day basis, so it does not punish people who play just a bit. But that means if you binge play you are not going to fly through the levels, just get a lot of stuff. I would really like to see a more streamlined loot system. Overall positive. But not a fast paced game from what I see so far. More of a sandbox mmo so far. I will try to update this as I find more.Pros--Sci-Fi-Combat is not Rapid fire button mashing. Tactics matter to some degree.-indepth systems for equipment, market, crafting, and research.-Tutorial is decent.Negs--Looting is slow. Double click to see. Hit loot all button or key, Repeat for all targets. (Not terrible, but a loot all in the area would be nice.-So many windows, interfaces, and menus. This gives a lot of information and options, but is not friendly to new players. -Graphics are not bad, and decent for the cost. But not going to blow anyone away.			"

												This is indeed EVE Light, and in a very good way! The population is lower, which allows for a very different economy that is much more accessible to new players. Many systems are simplified or outright improved, while combat being limited to a 2.5D plane demands an entirely new system of tactics- with the same great taste you know and love. This game's tutorial is also very exhaustive, and won't leave you adrift in an intimidatingly complex world. You will get a taste of all the activities on offer, and equip you to go out into the world and start making your name.All that said, this game is still early in development and it is telling at times. Random disconnects and crashes are present but fairly uncommon, but that is honestly the only criticism I can level. If you know EVE, you know this game and you will love it. If you don't know EVE- come and dip your toes into the Epitron. You might leave with a new favorite game.			"

												Ill start off by saying I bought this game about a year ago and did not play all that much due to not understanding the mechanics or how to even play. Main reason I bought it was it reminded me of Eve Online in its base skill set, such as the time driven skill point system, which was the main draw to the game. One thing that I do love is mech games and MMO's and a game that combines both is a major plus.Ok now to list my Pro's and Con's:Pro's:+Dedicated player base+Similar time skill training+FTP with small semi subscription in the form of EP booster+-Tutorial, shows a massive amount of information however would be better with voiceCon's:-Outdated Graphics needs update-+Major Learning Curve-Not enough of a diversity with mech types-User Interface Outdated, reminds me of Windows 98Not really a Con, but did some research and I understand why they took it out, is the fact you cannot 'Redo"" your character, not even in the first 15 days, However as a X-Eve player I understand this mechanic not being there anymore. The other thing that isnt really a Con would be the fact you are charged to delete a character you dont wish to keep, its a bit annoying to have them not know that they are screwed up and nothing can be done about it.I gave this a Recommend because there is not a middle ground, and I think while there is still a sale it is worth a try, but be ready for a wall of text for a tutorial, which does give great info but if your running it in 1080p or above it will be in small print which I dont see a way to enlarge.

												While the graphics seem slightly older, the gameplay is fantastic.  This game is like a mix of EvE, MechWarrior, and Wow.  For the price that is asked and the lack of monthly fees, this game is going on my top 3 currently played games.			"

												Purchased the game at a steal during the winter sale for $21 less than it normally would have costed. This is perhaps the best deal I have ever personally seen on steam in terms of value and satisfaction. I have played EVE Online in the past which is remarkably similar to Perpetuum (for over 8 years) so I will be making cross comparisons in this review between the two games.----------RATING: 90/100----------PROS:[] A very large open world. While not necessarily as large as the world of EVE-O, Perpetuum does seem to have a lot less transition loading between areas than EVE does. Loading sequences happen between different regions and upon entering terminals only (terminals==stations), whereas in EVE-O there is wait time between hundreds of solar systems that comprise a single region of space. Short version: EVE-O you have to wait anywhere between 5-25 times to transit across an entire region. In Perpetuum that degree of tedious does not seem to exist.[] Has a time-based progression system in the form of ""extension points"" (EP) that accumulate provided you log in at least once every 72 hours.  EVE-O has a similar system that uses skillpoints as well.  While there is slightly less flexibility with Perpetuum's EP system versus EVE-O's SP system, it is a godsend to players who hate level-based grinding and may or may not have the time to commit to being online constantly in effort to avoid falling behind others.[] Complex player-driven market with a versatile selection of equipment and supplies that can all be built by the player from the ground up. EVE-O has this as well though their market is much larger and more developed than Perpetuum's in part to being a older game with a larger player base at current. On the other hand, Perpetuum's market is young enough to where it is currently easier to make a living. Competition on the market is at a minimum in comparison to EVE-O's, and there is still time and room for a person of ambition to make a stake at becoming a production magnate with less effort and risk that would be required in a game like EVE.[] Varying levels of risk and player interaction does exist in Perpetuum. You have the choice to enter more dangerous regions to take advantage of the rich frontier, or to simply go look for a fight if that is what your aim is. On the other hand, you are not forced into this choice and may play it safe as well. EVE-O has a similar system, but there is one defining difference I have come to notice very quickly: You cannot suicide bomb a player in safe territories. That being said, you can be completely safe while doing your business in Perpetuum, provided you are in the right region, while in EVE-O there is technically no place that is 100% safe outside of being undocked.[] Community is much more friendly and a lot less cutthroat than the majority of EVE-O's tends to be. Players and corporations in Perpetuum tend to be a great deal more helpful and friendly, whereas in EVE-O the community is so cutthroat and survival driven to a point where players/corporation would appear very self-centered and paranoid to a outsider who is new to these kinds of games and does not understand the nature of the game play.  In the very nature of what EVE is it has weeded out virtually every average/casual gamer that may have existed within the player base over the years, leaving only the most die-hard, obsessive, elitist players behind, some more snobby than others, which is one of the bigger things that personally compelled me to stop playing EVE. This is a large part of why EVE has a infamous reputation for being such a harsh game with a community that can be very cutthroat (PvP/Indy alike). This is bound to happen when you have a game based on the quest for PvP/economic supremacy with at little boundaries as possible. That being said, Perpetuum's community has not yet started to rot into what EVE-O's has become today so it has more appeal over EVE's at current in terms of being a more pleasant social-gaming experience for any kind of game. This could end up changing in time but for now the atmosphere has not yet reached the point where Perpetuum has become just like ""Spreadsheets Online: Your Job Away From Your Job""[] Hands down, the biggest perk fo this game is NO SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED. This is a godsend to me personally. CONS:[] The player base is currently smaller than it could be. From what I've learned it used to be larger but had stagnated at some point. This can easily change and I'm pretty sure it most certainly will, but there are times when the game feels kinda quiet, but not ever empty.[] Design and graphics are a good deal behind modern engines, but not in such a way that overshadows the excellent mechanics and game play. Even still, the graphics are not up to spec and may turn cheek for those who hold the visual experience in high regard over everything else.[] UI is very similar to EVE-O's and can come off as boxy and old fashioned, especially to younger generations of gamers. While it may boast better control and be far from short of providing all the tools a player needs to play the game, it can be hard to understand for some people.[] Tutorial needs work. Could be condensed, simplified, and streamlined a great deal more but  at least is not a process that the player is forced into. Not recommended for the highly impatient, easily frustrated, more or less AD/HD gamers. Stick with CoD, this wouldn't be for you.			"

												More of a first impressions than a review. Havn't had a chance to suss out the community, so we'll talk mechanics. In no particular order.The GUI is...functional. It's something I think would benefit from a once over. Little things like displaying the hotkeys in tooltips would go a long way towards its usability.The tutorial is just...bad. If I were the devs, this is something I would focus on post-haste. Coming from EVE, nothing was confusing, but it was definitely far from engaging. The first few hours of any game are absolutely vital to getting a player hooked, and I imagine anyone who came in here not knowing what to expect may have gotten turned off pretty quick.Combat isn't bad, but I think the 'feel' of it could probably use some refinement. As well, the game isn't forthcoming with various hotkeys, which makes it a bit frustrating to rapid-click around until you look them up. If the process of targeting and selection could be streamlined, that'd help the combat portion of the game a great deal.The gameplay systems are similar to EVE in a lot of ways. I believe another reviewer described it as being Sam's Cola to EVE's coke, and I'll second that. Still, it's fun in its own right, if you can look past  some of the rough edges. I've spent my time in game so far mining, and that at least is a little more engaging than it is in similar games. It does a lot of things so closely to its inspiration as to be near identical in many. I'd hope as they go forward, the developers try to accentuate the differences in their systems more. All in all I'd recommend Perpetuum for someone looking for an open-world, EVE-like fix. Especially with a group I can see how it'd become quite enjoyable. Still, I'd recommend the Devs look into low-level usability concerns, like the UI and tutorial. An EVE-like game is inherently complex, and if they can maange to ease new players into that complexity well, and engage them in the process, they might have a winning combination.			"

												The game is still an MMO in every aspect even due to lack of a large player base. I have yet to even really meet many players in the game but I fairly new. I think this game has a lot of potential and just need to draw in more players. The beginning was slightly confusing to me. You go through the rookie training and then basically revert back to some newbie character. Just seems odd to me. The picking of an conglomerate after going through the rookie training is a different approach. Overall Need Players but still a enjoyable game			"

												Just started. Intresting ideas and complex for an mmo with Rock-Paper-Scissor combat. Leveling (if you call it that) is done on an account per day basis, so it does not punish people who play just a bit. But that means if you binge play you are not going to fly through the levels, just get a lot of stuff. I would really like to see a more streamlined loot system. Overall positive. But not a fast paced game from what I see so far. More of a sandbox mmo so far. I will try to update this as I find more.Pros--Sci-Fi-Combat is not Rapid fire button mashing. Tactics matter to some degree.-indepth systems for equipment, market, crafting, and research.-Tutorial is decent.Negs--Looting is slow. Double click to see. Hit loot all button or key, Repeat for all targets. (Not terrible, but a loot all in the area would be nice.-So many windows, interfaces, and menus. This gives a lot of information and options, but is not friendly to new players. -Graphics are not bad, and decent for the cost. But not going to blow anyone away.			"

												Ill start off by saying I bought this game about a year ago and did not play all that much due to not understanding the mechanics or how to even play. Main reason I bought it was it reminded me of Eve Online in its base skill set, such as the time driven skill point system, which was the main draw to the game. One thing that I do love is mech games and MMO's and a game that combines both is a major plus.Ok now to list my Pro's and Con's:Pro's:+Dedicated player base+Similar time skill training+FTP with small semi subscription in the form of EP booster+-Tutorial, shows a massive amount of information however would be better with voiceCon's:-Outdated Graphics needs update-+Major Learning Curve-Not enough of a diversity with mech types-User Interface Outdated, reminds me of Windows 98Not really a Con, but did some research and I understand why they took it out, is the fact you cannot 'Redo"" your character, not even in the first 15 days, However as a X-Eve player I understand this mechanic not being there anymore. The other thing that isnt really a Con would be the fact you are charged to delete a character you dont wish to keep, its a bit annoying to have them not know that they are screwed up and nothing can be done about it.I gave this a Recommend because there is not a middle ground, and I think while there is still a sale it is worth a try, but be ready for a wall of text for a tutorial, which does give great info but if your running it in 1080p or above it will be in small print which I dont see a way to enlarge.

								100% comparable to secondlife before mesh was introduced.Areas are ""sims"" limited maps surrounded by water, travelling between areas is done through teleports preplaced, this might change.Persistant world is not open world, it's not large, it's smaller than planetside 2 maps. The team may never connect all the grids into one big or several big connected grids.Terraforming, lifting the terrain already below you, or lowering it in specific places chosen by your or others with the capability to do so, nothing more nothing less.Vegetation and ""life"" does not move at the moment, no physics are involved for now either.Everything else in the description is true, a single server game world hosted from europe, etcetcetc.I must add that anisoptric filtering does not drastically improve the textures in the game, they come ""as is"".

								Yes, this game is almost a ""clone"" of EVE Online, except with robots instead of ships. However they seem to have done a pretty good job with addressing some of the problems that EVE has. Basically this is a good game for EVE fans to try, especially the EVE fans who are disgruntled with certain things about EVE. And best of all, there's no monthly subscription required, though if you want faster skill point accumulation then you have the option of paying for that. Fortunately thats all you can really pay for, so it doesn't suffer from ""pay to win"" issues.It's not as feature filled as EVE at this point, but they're working on it.			"

												I have been a long time fan of EVE. Played it for years and years.. But I have to be honest, it just didn't do it for me anymore. I needed something new. Insert Perpetuum! I have been playing it for 10 hours now and as a new player I have to say it feels and plays great. Most people say it has a huge learning curve and they would be correct in that aspect. But I do have to say, if you take the time to go through the tutorial area it really helps in getting started with the game. It's clear, to the point and it gives you nice bonusses for your new life in Perpetuum.This game is by no means an EVE replacement, but it feels and looks similar to it. The community is great and helpful but battlespirited and I feel like I will have a great time going forward with this game! I will post a more up to date review once I get more into this game!			"

												I saw Perpetuum on sale for 10 bucks, and since I had been debating on it for a while decided to give it a try. I hear many comparisions to EVE online, I didnt play Eve much but from what I do remember its a bit similar. But if a Sci Fi based 3rd person MMO with lots of robots/mechs, technology, crafting, weapons, and all types of modules to customize your robots sounds interesting, then you might want to try it especially while its on sale its only 10 dollars currently.There are several different sizes and types of robots/mechs to try out as well as weapons, armor, electronics, engineering, and other modules you can buy and equip even as a new player and more after you leave the starter zone. Some robots are very small and fast hit and run types with long range lasers or missles, and others are big bipedal mechs with big armor and big guns/lasers/missles, they are all fun. I recently used one of the smaller robots to make a fast moving long range sniper set up, with lasers and extra modules stacked to increase my targeting range for very long range shots, I couldnt believe the range I was getting. On the other hand, I have big mechs with tons of armor and firepower that run up and just destroy everything without even getting their paint scratched. Im looking forward to doing missions and hunting the NPC's past the starter area. There are also many of the lslands that are full PVP as well as some PVE ones past the starting area.Perpetuum to me is kind of like some of the car games where you have a lot of cars you can customize how you want, only this is with robots that blow things up. search for and mine minerals or plant material, run missons, etc. As I mentioned I got it on its current sale for 10 bucks so its dirt cheap. Im enjoying it so and looking forward to seeing whats past the starter zone. Hope this helps people learn a little bit about the game from a new players point of view.Clam			"

								I were scratching my head even after the ""tutorial"", but thanks to Zortags guide, and some persistency to keep on exploring. Perpetuum stands out as a very solid game, if you like mechs, that is. It feels a bit like EVE Online, but with robots, on islands. This game is not for everyone, but if your willing to learn and are not in a hurry, there's tons of exploring, bot killing and harvesting to be done, with a hefty looking carrot as reward. Double thumbs up, worth checking out if youre tired of the streamlined mmos you find elsewhere. This even comes with a nice community too, so check it out and join a corp while doing so (corporations = guilds/clans).			"

												I've been playing Perpetuum on and off since 2011, I only recently linked one of my accounts to Steam. While lacking in some areas and incomprehensible in others, it does have a certain charm and magnetism that keeps me coming back. I will say that this game has the best, that is to say, most meaningful and engaging PvP of any game I've played - being able to have direct control of your mech is much more engaging than EVE (which this game is often compared to).If you're a hardcore full loot PvPer that likes complicated but not deliberately overcomplicated game mechanics, a glacial learning curve, and gets off on the adrenaline shakes from potential glory/defeat in the heat of costly battles: Than this game is for you.

												4 hours of Perpettum so far - many many more to come.I plan to update this as I go but figured I'd do a early review.This game is a nice casual game as it has no monthly fee's and xp is done every day so long as you log in every 3 days - but its nice cause sometimes I have a real life and can't play a game but I don't want to unsub so feel like I'm wasteing time and money the depth and complexity of the game is pretty nice - you get a feel there is a ton of things to do when looking at manufacturing and research - I do enjoy research points are gained through looting them and can be traded which I like because I feel I actually have to get them they are not just given to me so it makes me run around for them.  Mining is a fun mini game as you have to use mining scanners to point you in direction driving around following markers till you get close enough to switch to a area map that shows the tiles in different colors - mining itself is pretty solid as well as while it takes time to fill it doesn't feel like I should take a nap while I wait Combat seems a bit simplistic at first - but as you upgrade you get more options from weapons ammos that deal different damages to repair drones to heal allies - mechs can be fitted with several forms of weapons each with there own interesting style all in all I'd give the game a solid 8 outta 10 - its not perfect but the devs seem to be talking with community and the community is friendly and helpful as welland my best recomendation simply is - would I buy it again knowing what I know?

												There is no reason for it to be as complicated as it is. All you need to know is that there's a hundred different screens, tabs and graphs you need to look at. And that there are just as many shortcuts you need to memorize as well.It suffers from a none intuitive interface. A game like this would have been very acceptable in the early 2000's, but honestly, it just falls short to games of todays standards. Making everything feel clunky, and, as I said, more complicated than it really needs to be.If you're a die hard fan of old-styled MMO's, then, perhaps give it a chance for 10$. It might not be that bad for you.However, I tend to judge games by their purchase date, and, as of today, there are just plenty of better games you could buy for your money.TL;DRJust have a look at one singular gameplay video on youtube. It should tell you enough, wether or not you want to buy this for 10$.			"

												Feels exactly like EVE Online, which is cool.  I've only been able to play a bit of the tutorial since the newest AMD drivers seem to have an issue with the game (keeps crashing/freezing), but looks promising!  Hopefully, the community is large and vibrant.  Looking forward to playing more when they get their driver issues fixed.			"

												Outdated graphics, outdated controls and I can't find a whole lot of positives to give this one. I can't convince myself to recommend this game. Perhaps in the 90's, it would have been a solid contender, but in 2016, it doesn't stand a chance unless you're expressly looking for a clunky MMO with a clunky gui, and slow controls. The combat system isn't anything to praise either. All of the interaction of a sub-standard MMO with all the pretty paricle effects of a substandard indie game. Sorry to be so critical of it, but I have to be honest here.			"

												The game itself is still ok, but I cannot recommend a game that is reliant on player numbers, but does not have them.Sadly developers have failed to find a course that would bring Perpetuum back to the days when playing it was ""Eve, but on the ground with mechs"" and not walking a ghost town.

												It's not quite accurate to say Perpetuum is Eve-Online-but-with-mechs, but it's a good place to start.  The games share a GREAT deal in design and general layout.There are a few things I've really enjoyed so far about Perpetuum.  There's basically always something to do, because running missions is actually a viable source of income.  If you want to get engaged you can choose a combat mission, or if you want to run the game in the background, you can do a transport mission.There are 3 levels of PVP - none, all, and some more.  You can play on the ""alpha"" islands without danger of PVP, or risk a trip to the outer islands for higher rewards, or a chance for a fight!Combat is meaningful because losing bots removes them from your inventory - and you have to buy a new one.  But the prices are aligned fairly well in my opinion, so that losing a bot doesn't feel like the end of the world.  It makes me much more willing to risk something for some fun.The game has a multi-level crafting system that can be shared at the corp level, 3 primary factions and 1 other faction that is still being added, and a lot of opportunity for player-created content.Key Feature: No subscription.

												Не так давно я вдруг заинтересовался роботами. Я стал искать в интернете, и выяснил, что реально хороших игр про роботов в настояший момент раз два и обчёлся. В конечном итоге я нашел две HAWKEN и Perpetuum. Первая игра мне лично напомнила контр-страйк, только про роботов. Я в неё поиграл немного, меня раздесять убили и надоело. А вот Perpetuum меня как-то сразу захватил. Особенно мне понравилась атмосфера планеты роботов, эти равнины, огромные здания диковенной архитектуры, небо, затянутое тяжелыви серыми тучами... Я люблю такую атмосферу, строгую и величественную, несколько даже гнетущую, я бы сказал. Всякую технику я тоже люблю, и техногенный стиь архитектуры в игре радует мой глаз. Ещё я люблю исследовать новые места, проникая вглубь неизведанных территорий, и возвращаясь оттуда с грузом артефактов. Тут игра малость разочаровала меня - посетив несколько остравов я не заметил принципиальных отличий. Разьве что расса врагов меняется, и их сила, ну и сама карта конечно тоже. Мне весьма не хватает каких-нибудь ""сюжетных"" локаций, единственных и не повторимых, куда стоило бы переть через всю карту чтоб просто посмотреть, а возможно и раздобыть какой-нибудь интересный трофей. Как в однопользовательских РПГ. В прочем, нечто подобное, думаю, ещё появится. Так же меня заинтересовала возможность строительства и терроформирования, но пока что я не достиг того уровня когда этим можно заняться, и ничего толком сказать не могу. На этом пожалуй остановлюсь, а то напишу длиннопост, и все читать поленятся))			"

												Okay I think it's time for a review.  I've been playing this game off and on since beta.  I had always hoped that this game would get better, but truth be told.  It sucks.  It wasn't too amazing in the beginning, but it has since gotten worse.  Latency has gotten worse, graphics have become dated with no desire to make them better, (something about the textures being hard-coded into the engine).  Player base has fallen to nothing.  I was really hoping that it's introduction to steam would be just the kick in the pants this game needed.  Unfortunately I was wrong.  Don't waste your time.			"

Product received for free
												How did I get this for free, you ask? I got this as part of the 2014 sale auctions.With unimportant introductions out of the way, let's get into the juicy bits about this game.I was a Perpetuum player for about 3 months, and I grinded endless hours into this game.My outcome? It's time wasted. That time (and money) should've been spent on an EVE subscription. Three months only allowed me to build medium bots for my faction; :thelodica: the Thelodicans and basic Industry, not counting the time spent grinding for materials to make a new bot.If you like games like perpetuum, you should stop and start playing EVE. Even the grinding in EVE is fun, if you do it right. In Perpetuum, it's too slow, and too grindy.You'll have more fun there than in here... Plus EVE is now free-to-play-ish.ProsOne-time fee; take your time, relax.There's a global chat. EVE doesn't have it. Great for socialising.Time-based training, and it trains instantly**EP (the training points) are awarded on a daily basis, and skills are trained instantly, or hoarded.ConsNo Beta/Gamma Island Access - These islands are heavily guarded by veterans and their corps. If you're not in one of those corps, you're pretty much locked out... Unless you want to die over... And over... and over...The markets are monopolised by the veterans corps who can afford to sustain themselves if all minable/collectable/harvestable/plantable/rattable/killable resources were to vanish.The game speed is slow. Very slow. Even slower than EVE.Population is very low.Everything is grindy. Even the research.EP is shared between characters. "

												This game is for anyone who wanted to know if Eve would work on the ground. the answer is no.Overall visual quality is mediocre, even on max settings, lots of ""ice skating"" animations where you slide around, the ground is far too smooth to be beleivable as anything more than a conveniently crafted game map. Pretty much every hud element and menu is far more complex than it needs to be.But hey, once you get out of the menus and start doing things its no big deal right? wrong. Combat is a mess. agro range and respawn time of most beginning enemies mean that you will be endlessly chased by dozens of them anytime you have to do one of the countless ""go here and kill 5 of these"" missions. weapon interaction with terrain and objects is inconsistent, so you never really know if you can use something as cover or not. mining is a bigger grind than eve as well, with less payoff.Basically, remove all warping and jumping from eve, constrain your view so you cant see whats going on ever, and narrow the entire color pallette of the game down to about 3 shades of grey. and now you have Perpetuum.Edit: Every sooften I try to get back into the game to see if things have improved (they have not) and I'm noticing just how toxic the community is. Most of the time, a tiny, struggling community will put forth an effort to welcome and help new players. after all, new players mean the game stays alive longer. However, any attempts to ask questions or get help from anyone is met with dismissal in chat, or trolling, or just generally unhelpful responses.			"

												This game is basically just a lower quality EvE with a stronger emphasis on mining. However, in this game, mining is much more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Instead of just going to a location and mining stuff, you have to play a mini-game. For the mini-game, you have to equip and use a geo-locator of sorts, then load it with the specific type of mining locating charge that you want. The charge will find that type of material and that type of material ONLY, no other types, just that one, and it'll only show you the nearest one, and tells you nothing about it, other than in what direction it is away from you. Not a distance, just a direction, and there's a fair bit of error in it too, so you can't fully depend on it. Then, after you find where the deposit is, you have to equip another type of charge to scan the tiles around you to determine which tiles contain how much of the material in your immediate area. So that's two different types of charges you need for mining only ONE type of material. But wait, there's more. In order to mine the material, you need a THIRD type of mining charge for your mining laser, and again, this charge will only mine one specific type of material, no others. So if you're looking for a few different types of materials, you have to have 3 different charges for each one whereever you go, and they're not exactly cheap nor small, they take up quite a bit of cargo space.All of this is kind of a nice change of pace from EvE's point and click adventure in mining, but it gets tedious VERY quickly. I'd love to recommend EvE, but that game might be worse... "

												While brand new to the game, Perpetuum is a blast!To start with, playing through the tutorials is a giant help. Not only do they explain, but they provide additional resources to help out once you ""officially"" begin the game.The community is very small currently. However, with more reviews and people in general promoting, this could be a giant game. Along the likes of EvE.I definitely recommend this game, especially for $10. Its a blast that will definitely keep you coming back for more.			"

												This game is something. Yeah, it reminds EVE, but it's easy for a bit and more friendly to the player.It's very awesome that DEV's still updating the game after all.You can also go on them forum and suggest your own idea to make game better!It have even in-game twitch streaming! (and it's very awesome integrated) Combat system is quite good, because you can hide behind buildings from enemy fire and use the landscape for tactics.Before buy i was afraid that it's a crappy cheap game, but I WAS WRONG about it.I'm in love with this game. For me - it's like imposing zen or doing yoga in world of MMO. (Soundtrack here is amazing) If you have friends and/or want to buy this game - do it. You won't regret about this! This game costs its price!I want to say thanks to DEVs and i will hope that they will not shut down servers for at least 2-3 years. Perpetuum, I LOVE YOU <3			"

												I gave it a shot when it came up on sale because I like these kind of games. I can't recommend it for just a few reasons I will describe.1.) Lengthy and kind of confusing tutorial. Not that bad but it definitely didn't leave any lasting positive impression2.) Uncomfortable UI and control setups. Too much going on everywhere and you have to do too much to perform some actions. This game was marketed as a sandbox rpg not a simulation.3.) Persistent world = Sucks for new players. I played a solid 9 hours and barely found any resources because it was all mined. In 9 hours I found maybe two nodes that had 'grown back'. And there are TONS of nodes...4.) The community isn't bad but there are a few people out there who just want to destroy your mech.5.) Linked to reason 4, if you lose your mech you lose your mech for good and X amount of hours were just wasted.6.) I lost my best mech and literally couldn't dredge up a reason to play long eough to make enough to buy another. Uninstalled.Game has no purpose, not even a faked one, and makes you wonder why you still have it installed when you encounter even one small setback. If you're into games like Eve Online but without the actual fun involved, play this.			"

												Great indie-mmo. Considering the work the Dev's put in to develop their own game engine is noteworthy. It does make development cycles slower. Good cheaper alternative to Eve. I consider the small community an opportunity to make a name for one self and impact greater change on the political landscape than one could in more popular mmos. Market system allows for the same gaming and economic expertise to take advantage of low supplied, or high demand bottlenecks in production chains. Combat is exciting, using cover, landscape, line-of-sight, or ballistic pathing of projectiles to calculate hits/misses. They just fixed artifacting to make it more intuitive (its super easy now). This mmorpg needs only one thing: MORE PEOPLE that plays it!!!Also the dev's are metalheads: if that isn't a reason to try it out, then I don't know what is. :D "

												GL getting through the tutorial. I even had an tutorial assistant (GM) helping; which turned into no help at all.  Just wanted to understand the artifact finder with the colored blocks and their meaning, in relation to the corrdinates to know which way it meant to go to.  The colors had some meaning, but the assistant told me the colors carry no weight in finding that artifact; I just asked then why do they show up as multicolors after using the scanner???  He could not answer that.  There were many other things, like very poor mechanics, horrible graphics, windows you can't close with Esc and need to click the ""X"" and controls in-general; which led to a horrible gameplay experience.  Game had potential, the advertising video makes this game seem like something it is not (VERY MISLEADING) and the tutorial alone was enough for me to not want to play.  What I find the worst was when the tutorial assistant had no idea what he is talking about.  Might try it again sometime in the future, but for now I cannot -recommend this game and my stream agreed, it was a horrible first impression.First Impression Sirspoony rating: 3.5/10Will come back some other day to try again and hope for the best, but for now this is my experienceUPDATE:  11/8/16I did not mention this in my first review post, but I really wanted to like this game.  I have been playing mech based games since Battlemech and the movie ""Robot Jox"".  The game is still awful though and not a pleasant gaming experience.  Graphics and controls are still very bad with bad mechanics.  Just stick with playing MWO, Hawken or just any other mech game out there; it will be better made and actually planned out better; by comparison.  The new reviews back this review and reinforce my original negative thoughts that I have had since the very beginning.  So I still can't recommend this game.CONCLUSION:Perpetuum is just not planned out well and not a game made for everyone, but those couple that like a very frustrating experience with many behind-the-times ideas that caused other games to fail; case in point.

												Wow, I was so looking forward to this game.  I waited months to pick it up, waiting for a good deal on it.  Now, I wish I hadn't   (sad face).  Ok, so the '80's called and want thier graphics back.  This is the worst thing about the game.  Everyone likes to compare it to EvE online, but there isn't any valid comparison at all.  the old atari 5400 games had some better graphics, and that is so sad in todays graphical age.  Economy is terrible, probably due to the ridicuously low player population and tax and fee for posting that are so high it's not worth selling on the player market.  Which brings me to buggy game play, now I have seen some awful targeting systems out there, but man this is bad.  I tageted a robot on more then one instance, just to have my missles or guns shoot at some foreighn object not even in the general ditrection of the target.  And yes, I am very sure of my target in question, it was extremely hilarious at the time, but very sad the more I think about it.  So lastly I will touch on the player population, I honestly do not know what is keeping the servers up.  In total I have seen in general chat, max has been 12 players at 1 time.  Now I only have about 6 or so hours of game time, but when I see that few players, and only a handful of guys even talking, then something is definately wrong.  The mining mechanics are ok, a little blah, but ok..  It's the rest of the game that feels awful, I hope they work on it and maybe re-release it at another time with some more spit and polish.  The general concept is awesome, it just seems very 1980's to me..  That is my review and these are my opinions.  I normally don't do reviews, but in this case, I had to.			"

Early Access Review
								To start off, this game is still in early access and does have some decent qualities. If you read through other reviews you will all see them mention EVE. This is pretty much eve, I would reccomend this game to anyone that likes EVE. But unfortunatly This nor Eve was my type of game. When they stated "" WASD "" movements, I thought it actually had to dodge and move/duck/dive, and you actually had to aim your weapons, giving the game a skill based gameplay. This was untrue. You simply "" lock "" your target and click the fire button. If your within range you shoot if not you probably shoot and miss.To sum it up,Great game if you like EVE,If your lookin for a Mech game where you actually control your character in a skillbased manner. look elsewhere.

												I really like this game. There are only two reasons why, after 5 hours, I don't see spending anymore time with it.1.) it's dead, nobody is playing, i never see any other players2.) the idea that terrain constraints burn up ""quest"" time is annoying... that is, spending a bunch of time just trying to figure out how my little robot dude can navigate the white vs. blue tiles just to get to something my scanners picks up gets a bit silly... although i agree with the idea that different mechs should have different terrain navigation abilities, it just leaves you feeling like i am going back and forth just trying to figure out a path for 20 minutes - nothing fun about itEven so, I recommend it because it is a very rich game and has so much potential even if it is aging out...

I think this game could go far but at this very moment of time i feel like the game is quite far away from that. If i was the developers i would work on the main screens of the game. Can be very slow. Tabbing out can result to the game lagging as well. Though this game can be fun while in game but requires a very good graphics card due to the robots looking un realistic when in low mode.Overall good game. Looking forward to beta and release.

												Do you like rollerscating robots?If you answered no to this question, then please read on.All of your new players are leaving almost instantly because the market is a great idea and works great in EVE online, which this game is a carbon copy of, but fails to deliver because there are no players to seed the market. If I want to upgrade my robot I have to play for a month and dump all of my skill points into research, because I can't find a market anywhere selling the robot I want.Honestly guys, this game would benefit most from adopting a free to play model and using micro transactions to fund further development. From my limited experience the game community has reciprocated this message over and over again. And they are absolutely right.And fix the scating robots, really. I will change my review to positive.Edit:If I want anything other than the noob robot apparently I'm forced to join an established PVP corperation, most of which are run entirely by the same core playerbase consisting of about 5 players.

												Ok, so I dont mind bad graphics, as I love Mechwarrior 4 mercenaries, made in 2000, but these graphics are just horrendus, I feel like im back in th 90's, I mean come one, MW3 had better graphics, made 15 years earlier! Ok, putting that aside, Im angry because, well the trailer makes the game look like MW Online from a different perspective where you can control your firepower, well nope, takes, with nothing euipped 10 seconds to lock onto a target, making the combat horrendus! They also added random stripes everywhere, so Im sitting watching the AI take me too a place for 2 whole minutes, if not more! Ill say they did a nice job of doing the art style, but the graphics are so poor, you dont even take notice, and I love the mech customization, but the same issue applies. All together, Im glad I grabbed this game in a sale, even though I bought the superior eddition. If the devs work on it, this game could become the new mech game everyones talking about. All together, I dont recomend this game, YET, because the devs can work on it.			"

												Eve clone with huge potential but... devs are clueless about their own game, they dont even play it so theres no hope for stupid mechanics to ever change. Really small player base, and minimal selection in terms on bots and fits compared to eve. Dont be fooled by the beta tag, this game have years behind.UPDATEThey introduced a patch to rebalance all bots to be almost the same (now they have bonuses to all weapons), watering down diversity even more and killing any hopes of creative fitting. Ecm is nerfed and most bots are inmune to webs.Things you will miss if you play eve:- Market (Either make an indy alt or prepare to purchase stuff at 10 times their real price)- Tracking. (Theres no such a thing as transversal in this game)- Variety of fitting options. (No room to be creative. Active tanking? i have bad news for you deimos and myrm lovers, you cant sustain cap at all. Did i mention one single bot is superior with all four weapon systems? Yes! ♥♥♥♥ you Megathron, my Apoc is a better blaster boat!)- Skill based kills (Forget it rifter, you wont get under the guns of that Mega. Theres no tracking/transversal, signature tanking exist... as a chance based roll, that means they will miss you, until they dont)- Risk (""High sec"" is 100% safe in this game, no ganks, no awoxing)- Low sec trafic (Theres no incentive at all to be outside ""high sec"", that means ""low/null sec"" is mostly deserted)- Evefit (This isn't the games fault but is the worst part, you know you cant live without eft!)Theres a bunch more stuff missing in that list but you get the idea. Game would be great with proper module selection, balancing, mechanics, and low sec features. Did i mention population in this game is like 100 online on average? Mostly alters.			"

												=======PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO PURCHASE======= I wish I could have found a review that could have saved me money like this one...I had high hopes for this game before I even tried it and bought a second copy to gift out to a friend... after playing it;Oh, GHOD....I can give most games quite a bit of a chance... at least complete the tutorial and do a couple missions...This game, honestly, should collect what it can and quit now, maybe focus on a new game.I'm sorry Zoom, but honestly.I could sum this up pretty damn quickly:- Has a HORRIBLE character creation that tries to copy EVE Online.... But FAILS miserably- Has the overview and window system of EVE Online.- Has the same buttons and mechanics of EVE Online. (Interact, Approach, Turrets, Reload, Reload All, etc.)- Has the same character progression as EVE Online. (Even skill names)- Even the tutorial agent is a male version of EVE Online.Basically it ATTEMPTS to copy everything in EVE Online, but just fails.... HARDThe graphics, even for being 5 years old, honestly is on-par with PS2 graphics.... No that is not a miss-type, Playstation Two graphics... This is with everything completely maxed, some PS2 graphics nukes this game.Now don't get me wrong, I can jive to a game with crappy graphics if the game has things that can help overlook the complete lack of any esthetics. This, has nothing that I found.All in all, I honestly wish I could get my money back!If you are looking for a mech game I suggest playing these;Robocraft - By far the best customization in any mech game. Period. (Free-2-Play)Hawken - Some of the most intense battles to be had, though lacking players. (Free-2-Play)M.A.V. - Team and tactics oriented combat, some re-birthed Chromehounds after its death. (20$)Those are just games I validate, Robocraft I've supported with 100$ just because it is the best that I see on the market, even though it is free-2-play, you don't need to pay anything at all to have amazing fun.I'm sorry Zoom, but seriously... I'm surprised CCP hasn't sued you for IP infringment... Honestly.			"

												Its a dead game. started at to high of a price ($29.99) preventing it from building a player base. now there is about 100 active players. so there is no market to speak of. so the only way to play if to make every thing on your own.this game should go free 2 play and just sell cosmetics...there is a ton of content but no players to make it enjoyable.your better off playing eve online.

												As a player who has played Perpetuum for a awhile anyone who pays 30 dollars for this game would have been better off burning it as you would have at least have the momentary benefit of the fires warmth as opposed to the frigid bombardment of ignorance and poor development.  First - The game is filled with bugs.  Npc AI is horrible. This has lead to economy entirely based on bots and afk miners.  Second - risk reward in pvp is crazy messed up. There is no reason to live or do anything on pvp islands and it is far more lucrative to bot on the beginner zones. Third - Development team is completely incapable of putting out content  at all.  the content has been rehashed for the past two years. Forth - Lack of content in general. Fifth - Little to no population. This is directly related to the terrible patches and update speed of the DEV team. There are may other examples of why not to play or spend your money on this game but to sum things up I will say this. I have never seen a game with so much potential so easily and completely destroyed by the incompetence of a few DEVs.  Do not waste your time or money.TL;DRI recommend playing outside over playing this game.  "

												Game Play was decent , start was dull and repetative. Not much of an online community, and hidden additional costs were discovered. I would not recomend this game.On a personal note. This game is a one way train ride, as with many games like this you are given experience points to improve skills when you start the game, however if you want to start over and do things differently, it cant be done without paying more cash to regain the points you previously used , it could even be more than the initial cost of the game. So if you do purchase this game you might want to research the best options for upgrading your character . Personaly this took some the fun outa the game .			"

												First game that made me check on if i could actually sell games in my steam library, 4/10I've played this game for a bit now and it lacks purpose, for me that is. I haven't played Eve so i can't compare it to that. But i bet Eve is much more fun just by looking at the combat, there is no combat whatsoever that could have been more boring than in Perpetuum. However, if we leave the combat aside, what is there to do? Grinding endlessly while waiting for your daily points to spend to get to a higher level. For what? To PVP and possibly lose your mech. This game doesnt have any PVE content next to some stupid robots to grind. Then you can get massive wealth, for what? Owning a bit of the world... Then the graphics make the game even look less desirable, if i grind i'd atleast like to look at some scenery or awesome effects. but no that aint working well either.This is my opinion and clearly not my game			"

Support is also non existant. Driving mechs around is fun, but if you really want to do that get Mech warrior.			"

								Remember how in EVE you could haul goods from one sector to another, and go AFK to releave the tedium? Well imagine that but you can't go AFK, you've got to navigate with WASD over a glitchy terrian where your tank track robot can't even go up a small incline.Remember how in EVE you could go mining, target a bunch of asteriods and sit and reap in the goodness? Well imagine that, but instead you have to keep retargetting every 4-5 minutes!I got this game as an EVE alternative, but its like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retard child of EVE. The combat is dull, the graphics are sub-par, the world is tiny, the UI is absolutley terrible (and thats coming from an EVE player) the musical score sounds like it was composed by highschool students (seriously, theres one track where the drummer can't drum for♥♥♥♥♥♥.I really tried, REALLY tried to like it. But it just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, and just makes we want to play EVE more.If you're looking for an EVE alternative, steer clear of this one... However if you're looking for a glitchy broswer based standard game give it a whirl!I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.			"

								Unfortunately, there is no yes/no button for this game. Those -like me- who had some extra cash to spend and found the first look of this game appealing should probably know that you won't be getting an A-grade game title. It has the basic feel of a very good browser game.This product will get you invested on the game mechanics and community interaction ONLY, as the controls and graphics are somewhat clunky, rather difficult to master and the sheer volume of information one has to process from the very get-go is starteling which might be offputting to a more casual type of player. So prepare to go through a lengthy tutorial process and a long learning curve.Be aware that this isn't 'early access' but a long-established community. Consequently, players might be less understanding of newcomers. On the bright side, there is a well-developed market and team system.Basically, you must know that in order to like this game you should be prepared to really invest some time and effort. For those who do, it might yield a satisfying gaming experience. Everybody else will probably be over-burdened by the complexety of this game.			"

								I just couldn't stand how this game was set up. The trailer up there was very deceiving. I expected something like Mechwarrior online, having an easier time with the combat. But no, you have to bring up 5 menus to fight. The fighting is very RPG-style is understandable, but make it more engaging. There was too much clutter everywhere. The graphics are bad for today, maybe good for something like 2003 or older. I didn't like all the transporting and this and that. I just wanted a mech game where I could jump in and shoot stuff and kinda do stuff (not on their basis), not your regular MMO. Items didn't even show up for the transport tutorial, which I don't even deem necessary for a game where the main aspect seems to be fighting, which is complicated as f*ck.			"

								This game is strange. It's been around for 3 years at least and to me hasn't changed the slightest. Being an eve player, where expansions occur and things change. The game just seems the same old boring junk it was 3 years ago. I'd like to point out I've logged plenty of hours on the game to try and make it worth it. My experience of games of all caliber is rather large with over 100 games on steam alone. Including alot of ""small MMO's"" and alot of ""Free 2 Play"" games that put this to shame.The good:-It contains a decent player base social wise, however the player population isn't so great.-The combat is pretty fun when you actually get to be involved/reach the fight.-Corporations are really fun(like guilds).The bad:-As a new player you are forced to walk a silly distance for 20 minutes at mind numbing pace just to kill 4 things and return for a tiny credit sum.-It's a really small map and content amount.-Not many massive overalls to the game.-Very dated graphics and UI. -3 Days only skill credits if you don't log in you get no points. With most skills taking a minimum of 20 days + before you obtain enough credit points to ""Buy them/learn/upgrade"" them.-Unlike other reviews it's not actually that much like EVE. (which I know it's not supposed to be but since everyone compares it, I have to say it's very different apart from the old pre-2005 Eve Ui.) -The video for the game is rather missleading, you won't be changing robots often.-Nothing to make your robot unique really. Opinion:This game needs a drastic overall with new graphics, a new more intuitive transport system and a much more dynamic robot/item selection so you don't get bored or worse; smash your head upon the keyboard. ----I'd ask for my money back if possible.----If you look at the comment's of this review, you find a prime example of an exception to the community. Edited:04/05/2014 for a more respective approach to the content.			"

Early Access Review
								Its alright. Starts you off with 10,000,000 [currency] and unlimited skills and after u finish the intro missions it takes all of it away and drops you off with no further explanation. Not what I would describe as a fast paced mmo in any way when you have a fixed amount of daily progression and increase in skill undefined by what you have the skill to do or not.			"

								wash rinse repeat of eve online, just with mechs instead of ships. the premise of eve online and perpetuum is a great one, but balancing in eve was disgusting. all the time spent in eve could be wiped away in seconds, and perpetuum feels exactly like eve. i refuse.			"

												Dont buy it. Save your money somewhere eles.   This is not a finished game at all, and the graphic is terrible. The control is terrible. This game is a totally failure.			"

												If you ever played Eve Online and enjoyed it but wanted something a tad more casual then this is the game for you!You are in mechs instead of space ships and the skill system is similar in the way that you get points every day to spend, so its still a time progressive skill gain just like eve. I'm enjoying it, specially grabing it during the sale and the plus side is theres no monthly fee!Now that EVE Online has gone F2P i can no longer recommend this game. Go play eve instead, i can't see the population of this game holding up to that one.			"
