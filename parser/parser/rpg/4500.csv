												Many moons ago in 2003 I stumbled upon a trailer for a game called S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Oblivion Lost

 Needless to say after watching that I quickly became obsessed with this game. Searching high and low for every bit of info I could get my eyes on, The GSC forums became my 2nd home while I awaited its arrival. I remember at the time I was playing Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, With it I fell in love with non-linear open world 1st/3rd person games with RPG elements and how much I could get immersed in virtual worlds. I am all for fantasy settings don't get me wrong, but there is nothing more terrifying than reality. (With a spin of fiction of course, alternate reality if you will) The abandoned urban/industrial locations in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. were more my cup of tea. That in itself made me very excited to play it. I couldn't wait to get lost in its world. While I waited though I researched about the Nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in April 1986, it was mixed emotions for me. I was sad/amazed/intrigued. Sad for all of those people who lost their lives because of this. Nothing but respect for the liquidators and anyone involved in the initial cleanup. Those people are heroes and deserve nothing less. Amazed that this game had some real history in its background story. Even if it is incredibly embellished (mutants, anomalies, artifacts etc etc.), you have to admit it makes for an interesting premise to a story. Finally, Intrigued on what these game developers had in store for the players to experience, without making a mockery of those who had lost their lives in this tragedy. The game also borrows elements from ""Roadside Picnic"" by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and the 1979  Andrei Tarkovsky film ""Stalker"". If you haven't heard or checked them out yet, they are most definitely worth it. Masterpieces in their own right.Well turns out it was a long wait lol, game finally arrived in March 2007. It was no longer Oblivion Lost, it was now called Shadow of Chernobyl. Which was a welcomed change imo, what was not a welcomed change was the amount of content/features that were removed from the game. Vehicles, locations/maps made smaller and simpler, monsters/mutants, superior lighting from old alpha builds among many other things had been removed it was rather disappointing to say the least. The survival aspect of the game took a huge hit, leaving many in the community confused as to what happened during development. GSC Game World regardless of all the missing features still delivered a good game and it was well received by critics as well. The game at release had performance issues and bugs that required some patching. Once that happened it was clear that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl was a game ahead of its time. In a league all its own and a true gem in the PC gaming world. The atmosphere takes front row seat in this game it is almost like another character in the game. Such believable atmosphere it is downright amazing, it keeps you on the edge of your chair as you play. Pros:- Incredible atmosphere!- Impressive use of lighting and shadows, - Cloud shadows that shift as day/night cycles progress. - None stylized (photo based) textures (adds to the realism), Replicating the rust and decay feel.- Great cut-scenes that hold up even by today's standards. - Plenty of side quests - Exploring is encouraged to find secret stashes scattered throughout the world to find loot, weapons, ammo, suits and artifacts. Artifacts can be placed on your belt to grant the player abilities like resistance to radiation, increase weight limit etc. Some interesting combinations that can be made with the multitude of artifacts available in the game. - The games AI can be quite challenging because they adapt/react/flank/take cover depending on your approach. This adds to the games replayability immensely, if its one thing I have learned playing this game is that when it comes to killing the AI is that no playthrough is ever the same. Never. They are very unpredictable lets put it that way.- Trading system with merchants and other friendly AI characters- ""The Zone"" is alive even when you are not in the same vicinity, AI will be fighting mutants and/or other factions (Bandits, Duty, Freedom, Loners, Military, Mercs, Ecologists & Monolith) All fight among themselves.Besides all the bells and whistles the story is incredibly engaging and keeps you interested throughout. Without too many spoilers (I am sure most people reading this have already played this but still) You play as ""Marked One"" an amnesiac trying to retrace his steps, he is then set on a mission to the heart of ""The Zone"" (term used to refer to the 30 kilometer Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, established after the accident.) to find a target and their whereabouts. Game also has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player, 7 in total.Cons:- Lots of ""fetch"" side quests (Surprise? lol)- AI that can sometimes see you from ""miles"" away (vanilla)- Some quest giving characters can die. (vanilla)Just a heads up. Nothing game breaking but worth noting. Just like all games, it is not perfect. :)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The mod scene for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is very much alive.When your done with vanilla (though not necessary, I would recommend the community fixes of ZRP goes well in a first playthrough to have the best bug-free experience with the game). Shadow of Chernobyl has some amazing mods worth playing, especially if you are looking for new storyline or another playthrough with better visuals, more weapons, new side quests, improved enemy AI, realistic weapon damage & accuracy etc. Some I can recommend are:- ZRP (Zone Reclamation Project) (community fixes keeps vanilla intact) ZRP[www.metacognix.com]- Priboi Story- L.U.R.K.- OGSE (Old Good Stalker Evolution)- AMK v1.4 - Secret Trails 2- ABC Inferno (if you are a masochist)- Narodnaya Solyanka variants (my favorite Narodnaya Soljanka DMX 1.3.2 dkz02)- Autumn Aurora- STALKER Soup- Oblivion Lost- AMK: Autumn Edition- Lost Alpha (standalone)Some of these mods add in the cut content (mutants, weapons, vehicles etc.) The list goes on really, just my humble recommendations on the ones I have tried. Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat are awesome games as well, worth checking out at least once. They also have great mods which I will not mention in this review. But I will say that there is something about Shadow of Chernobyl's allure and atmosphere that didn't carry over as well to the other two games. Out of all three games, Shadow of Chernobyl is by far still my favorite.I don't claim to know everything about these games, because honestly I don't. I still discover new things about them every time I play them. They are gifts that just keep on giving. Thank goodness for Eastern European  game developers!5 stars ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ) out of 5			"

												Get the community patch which upgrades graphics, enables quicker keys to save, breakable lights fixtures and more! Takes the game from good to great! STALKER is my favorite gaming style! (I got the file patch from gamefront. Its 703.1MB and an exe.http://www.gamefront.com/files/16359911/STALKER_Complete_2009_# )Sneak around and attempt to take out any force with stealth attacks. The more silent you are, the more deadly you become. When you kill an enemy, pick their body up and hide it. Enemies see only whats in their vision, and while an enemy is in-sight they appear on your mini-map. If you don't crouch, they will hear you even easier! Turn on night vision and pull out your silenced weapon to become the ultimate STALKER! (still challenging!)Each NPC has a unique name, and they will remember if they like you. They can die from enemies too, though. The killed NPCs are replaced with half as many fresh new NPCs, most of the time, which helps the game still feel alive, and progresses. If you shoot your friend once, they will forgive you. If you shoot them twice, then its war...There are different groups/factions. Military, Bandits, Loners, Duty, Freedom, etc. Everything is at war. If you pis-off the Military, they will attack your base. If you don't ball-up, they will all die. Game changing! Although, you can save anytime you want. Which makes winning a serious battle, actually possible. Making you the most badass in the zone! Although, no one truly knows how cool you are, due to saves! ;D  (I wish there was a video replay, where it shows you how [through saving] your character is elite.)Mutated animals run around constantly. Sometimes you can take a souvenier from them. The types of mutated creatures become really sneaky and different than you can imagine. They will solo attack armed soldier squads too. Sometimes wiping them out. You get no rewards for helping NPC communities survive, but it is rewarding to know you just saved a friendly base.Better equipment comes much faster from helping NPCs with a task. But you will probably gain access to much of the same guns much later on, from fallen enemies, except armor never drops from enemies. Bullets fall with gravity. You can watch a bullet fall towards a distant target. If you choose to use a sniper weapon, you will have to adjust your manual aim to compensate for this new thing called gravity. Also, the distance between you and your target feels real!What else... there are... artifacts, which give bonuses. They are supposed to be found in anomalies, which are dangerous ghost like traps. If you hear your radiation meter going off, throw a metal bolt by pressing 6, to see if you are about to get zapped by stepping on a trap. Also, if you hear radiation, you are probably getting pummeled with radiation poisoning. Might want to step back. Suit up to get less exposure! (This seems bigger in the game Pripyat.)Lastly, the atmosphere is really in depth. Everyone speaks with a Russian accent, and when the wind blows the bushes wave. Day/Night cycles and eating let you feel like you are really camping in the zone. Its cold and a loner's friend.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R can be best described as ""That Russian game"" because it just is every Russian fantasy period. Running through Chernobyl killing mutants. I mean there's more to it than that but everything, from the look to the amount of Kalashnikov porn lives and breathes Russian and to a greater extent Ukrainian culture.The premise of SoC is that you are a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. A treasure seeker and one day you awake with amnesia with a single objective reading in your PDA. ""Kill STRELOK"". With no further purpose in mind you set off north to the power plant where mutants and other stalkers reside. What I love about the plot is it has this inherant mystery to it. You gradually uncover more clues about Strelok and his group, and about the Zone of Exclusion as a whole. Compared to the two other S.T.A.L.K.E.R games, this one sets the stage as both a horror game and as a mystery game.Adding to that SoC has very challenging complex gameplay. The AI is very good and GSC intended the firefights to feel similar to multiplayer matches in games like Counter Strike. The AI waits for you, it ambushes you and ramboing in only seeks to get you killed. You have to be smart about your engagements.One thing to note about this game and the other two is that there are mods that fix most of the bugs and improve the overall gameplay. The two I recommend are STALKER Complete 2009 and LURK.

												The BEST GAME EVER MADE!!!!  Sure it has its fair share of glitches but if you look past them you are in for the ride of your life!!!!Pros-Very Challenging-Tons of very good mods-The most atmospheric game ever-Actually creepy as hell at times-Better ai then even FEAR-Fire fights are really epic espcially when you fight the military and monolith-Long main quest; takes about 10-15 hours to complete-The locations in this game are based on real life Chernobyl, which is very haunting especially when you are alone-Really cool monster designs-Craploads of weapons -Alot of side quests-Music is fantastic-Pretty big open world; although it is segmented-Multiplayer is actually fun, although don't get this game for it's multiplayer as its mainly dead except for a few Russian Servers-The many different factions are all very cool, my favorite is Duty-Artifact hunting is fun-Exoskeleton is the coolest power armor ever-The wildlife is better than Far Cry 3's as they hunt each other and even eat dead Stalkers-Ok storyline not great but not badCons-Extremely buggy; I suggest you download Stalker Complete 2009 for your first play through as the vanilla game is even buggier than Bethesda games-Steam decided to update the game to 1.0006 patch which is a very terrible patch as it crashes everytime you loot a body; I suggest rolling back the game to 1.0005 as its more stable and more mods are compatible for it.  Just look up how to do it on the steam forums its there somewhere-Some characters tend to repeat lines over and over again when you are standing near them; there is a mod to fix this so I suggest you find it on Mod Db "

												A true love it or hate it type of game. There is a huge open world to explore and lots of stuff to do, but you're also putting up with long load times, often game breaking bugs and other errors that kill the immersion.In terms of atmosphere, few games can come this close to being so engrossing but this game does have its fair share of problems. Great weapons, great sound and a somewhat interesting story, even if it is one long escort quest. Just keep in mind that this won't be a smooth ride.Full video review:

												It's not a horror game, exactly, but it has one of the bleakest atmospheres I've ever encountered. The sandbox elements enhance the feeling of being trapped in a nightmarish world ravaged by nuclear disaster.  Of course, there is more to the story than that, but anyone who is fascinated by the horrors of the Chernobyl disaster will be interested in this game. Those who enjoy a challenging FPS will as well.			"

												I was recently introduced to the S.T.AL.K.E.R. universe through Shadow of Chernobyl. I was won over by this, it has so much going for it. A FPS sandbox game set in the Zone, a secret scientific facility with mysterious environmental anomalies in the ruins of Chernobyl. You are a Stalker, one of the many rogues who make a living by scavenging the ruins and seeking valuable rocks. The environment is challenging, the array of weapons and other items is huge, great missions, great gameplay (stealth, economy, range and style of movement), plenty of mystery. I like that the gameplay continues while you rummage through your inventory. I really appreciated being immersed in a cultural environment that was not the usual Hollywood inspired rubbish - in this world you are a person with no history, trying to figure out your past against a Ukrainian-flavoured backdrop amongst hardened and macho men. This has a lot of blokey appeal. This is one of the best dilapo porn games ever, picturesque and epic. Whenever I play a game that is based on a real-world location, I'm usually disappointed, but the Chernobyl Power Station map was one of the most enjoyable I have ever encountered, and not just for its epic representation of the location. This game is as close to perfection as a game can get.I highly endorse this and Call of Pripyat - weeks of fun, and I can't wait to check out Clear Skies.			"

												I'm walking through this area called ""The Garbage"" or something similar. Hear a cry for help on my PDA, some STALKERS are being pinned down by some bandits. Decide to go in and help. Clear bandits and meet with leader. He thanks me and says he'll take me to this underground tunnel where they heard there was a weapons stash, but couldn't get to. Okay, sure, I could use the guns.Climb down manhole. It's quite dark. Crouching as to not be loud. Come to a doorway and peak around. See 5 or so guys. One of them must have seen me, they start shooting at me. Throw grenade and take potshots with pistol to save precious submachine gun ammo. Kill bandits after a few minutes. Loot their bodies. Take a staircase nearby. Keep hearing this huge ""whooooooshhh"" sound. Go to check it out. Lightning is sweeping down the corridor, not an anomoly I'd want to be in. Take a different route. Sneak down this spiral staircase. Walk around acid anomolies. Come to this broiler room. Walk on this edge by a wall. Super dark down here, have my flashlight on but don't want to be seen. Take out my binoculars to see far end of the room. Binoculars will automatically highlight a target if there is something in your field of view...something gets highlighted. I'm not down here alone. Start to creep forward, hear really heaving breathing. Creep forward again, hear footsteps. Scoot back against the wall. Wait for a minute. Equip best gun and decide to go for it. Start creeping forward. Hear running behind me. All I can see are these glowing orange eyes, and the outline of something invisable. Panic shoot, forgot gun is in single burst mode. Panic clicking. Thing runs away, so do I, back into my corner. Heal up and reload. Step out again. Crazy ♥♥♥ thing comes running back, load about 40 bullets into it til it drops. Looks like Cthulhu.Hear shouting at other end of hall. More gun fire. Sound like another creature is fighting some more people. They chase creature my way. I'm trapped in corner. ESC. QUIT TO WINDOWS. I played for about 15 minutes.			"

												A Stalker is someone who ventures into the ecological disaster zone created by the fictional second explosion of the Chenobryl Nuclear Power Plant to recover artifacts that defy the laws of physics. I won't go into further details of the game, as I the mysteriousness of The Zone, and how to survive there are the most endearing features of the game.It took me a long, long time to fall in love with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. I first booted this game up on release day, and my good 'ol Athlon64X2 choked on it. Performance won't be a problem in this day and age, but the X-ray engine's poor optimization was killer back in '07, and the fact that the patches would erase your save game only added insult to injury (again, this won't affect the gamers of today). After I had finally tweaked the game into a playable state, I found an intriguing title with a fantastic premise, and a living, breathing world overflowing with atmosphere. However, exploring The Zone wasn't the beautiful experience that it should have been. The place was crawling with bugs, glitches and anomalies (and not just kind you are supposed to be exploring there!) The shooting physics were far from consistent, the translations were poor, and the game would still crawl along at a snail's pace. There is still much to love about the game, but playing through on vanilla left me feeling that the title just didn't live up to all that it could have been.That all changed with I discovered the heavy modding scene for the series. I recommend reading up on the various fan overhauls for Stalker, and installing one before you even first step foot in The Zone. There are many to choose from, such as Complete 2009, Misery, or my personal favorite, Lurk. After playing through the game with fan enhancements, I found myself beyond taken by this title's bleak wonders. I would go as far as saying that Stalker with the Lurk mod is my favorite first person shooter experience of all time. I found myself so infatuated by the Zone and her mysteries, that I read  and enjoyed the book ('Roadside Picnic,' Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, 1971) and  watched and adored the film ('Stalker', by Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979). I also researched the fascinating tragedy of the real life Chernobyl disaster of 1986.In conclusion, if you are a patient gamer who fancies a real challenge and getting lost in a bleak world in a devastated Ukrane, I simply can't recommend a modded version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R enough.Get out of here, Stalker. 100 Rads out of Ten			"

												Yes the game is plagued by bugs, but gaze over them (or just install a simple mod fix) and what you’ll find is an FPS with RPG and horror elements that evokes feelings that you’ve possibly never experienced before. It perfectly captures the overwhelming mood of a decrepit world without getting repetitive or monotonous.It captivates you, inundates you with a constant wave of ambience and atmosphere, creating an illusion of desolation. The realistic gameplay and sound effects coupled with the brilliant soundtrack and periodic spine tingling bellows from mutated monster(lings) in the distance helps forge this. So despite being armed to the teeth with lead, gunpowder, rations and a generous light source it does what most (survival) horror games fail to do. It’s a preview of emptiness and loneliness. It makes you hesitate. Permit yourself temporary freedom and succumb to misery and mystery in the dense expanse known as The Zone. Recommended mods: -Autumn Aurora 2: Necessary tweaks and amplifications of what makes the game great while also keeping your experience as vanilla as possible.-Zone Reclamation Project: All your technical issues fixed with one simple mod. Additional recommendations:-Russian dictionary..			"

NOTE: As I am reviewing the original product, and not various third-party mods, this review is based on a vanilla playthrough. Please keep that in mind, thank you.+ Functional, user-friendly navigation and quest-mapping device+ Artifacts add slight RPG-like stat combinations+ Vast, detailed environments+ Very, very strong sense of atmosphere pervading throughout+ Boasts a large and active modding community (many mods do well to address some of the game's various pitfalls)+ Equipment and weight limitations do much to force the optimization of one's gear, and make one choose what to discard and what to keep; this leaves the player feeling both challenged and rewarded as they acclimate to the concept+ Ambient sounds are absolutely fantastic, and keep the player consistently unsettled+ Weapon degredation adds to the challenge, and makes one keep an eye on their equipment+ Manner of interaction with various game-world NPCs is largely determined by the player's actions throughout the adventure+ The game's world and atmosphere compliments an intriguing plot; the story, itself, rewards inquisitiveness+ Moderate variation in firearms+ Absolute plethora of side-missions- No fast-travel; this likely will not bother the realists out there, but I felt that there could have been a comfortable middle-ground implemented that would have kept everyone happy- Lots and lots of bugs, some of which are quite problematic (again, most of these can be remedied via the modding community)- Largely flat and uninspired voice-acting- Malleable NPC relationships notwithstanding, the story is fairly (although not completely) linear- No autosave function (except when entering new areas, but the environments are mostly sprawling areas, making this insufficient); massively frustrating when you die 45 minutes into a new area and forget to manually save, forcing you to take significant steps back in progress (although I believe there is a mod available to remedy this)LockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is one of those special games that punches way above its weight class. It seeks to be an open-world, open-ended FPS/RPG with fluid relations between characters, emergent behavior in the wilds, and a compelling story and setting underpinning the whole thing. Those are lofty goals for any game, much less one from unproven developers back in 2007. What's shocking, then, is just how much it gets right even by modern standards.In the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., the Chernobyl disaster spiraled outward to create the Zone, a harsh land ruled by mutated creatures, spatial anomalies, and mercenaries seeking to capitalize on the chaos. You play one such S.T.A.L.K.E.R. sans memories, sent back into the Zone to kill a mysterious figure close to the epicenter of it all. Along the way you'll forge alliances with other wanderers, discover threats far worse than mutated wildlife, and maybe come face to face with the source of the disaster itself. I wouldn't bank on that last one without some serious effort, though.Instead of discreet levels, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is made up of maps that connect to form one contiguous world. Starting near the border of the Zone, you'll journey through radioactive swamps, underground bunkers, ghost towns, and more as you complete jobs for the other inhabitants. Sometimes that'll mean finding a stash of bizarre artifacts, and other times it'll mean gunning down a band of killers in their hideout. There's plenty to do in the Zone even without a specific mission, as you can loot corpses, hunt hidden stashes, and locate artifacts by navigating the treacherous anomalies that can crush, shock, or maim you with little warning.All of this is accomplished from a first-person perspective, but don't expect the run-and-gun action of... anything, really. The combat in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is very much its own thing, a perpetually harrowing affair of dancing around cover, emptying magazines to only land one shot, and pumping dozens of bullets into charging beasts. Weapons in the Zone are inaccurate, difficult to use, and seemingly do no damage until you land a headshot that kills in an instant. I imagine it's more like real-world firefights than anyone would admit, but that doesn't necessarily make it fun to be eaten alive by wild dogs who dodged or shrugged off a dozen rounds.You'll want to avoid combat as much as possible, at least at first, and luckily there's a robust and effective stealth system to make use of. This system tracks your light level, posture, noises made, and even gives you bolts you can toss to cause distractions (or trigger anomalies). There's a pretty big emphasis on stats across the board, really. Your character has resistances to all kinds of injury as well as a radiation level to monitor, your inventory has weight and conditions to consider, and every single NPC in the game has a reputation rating with you. There aren't always systems that address these stats directly, but they do represent significant depth to the simulation.Attention to detail extends to the environments, and it is here that you'll find S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s greatest strength. For a nearly ten-year-old game, the Zone looks amazing, with crumbling buildings and thick underbrush and rolling clouds blotting out the sun. There's a palpable sense of decay and instability wherever you go, and it only grows more intense as you approach the heart of the Zone. Every dark corner can hide a creature that wants your blood or an anomaly that can rend you in an instant, demanding caution and tense attention even in the daylight hours. And don't get me started on the underground bunkers... some of the most effective horror encounters I've experienced in gaming have come in the subterranean halls of the Zone.I've spent a lot of time extolling the virtues of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. because they are many, but not without a price. It is an ambitious indie game after all, and that means all sorts of potential glitches and instability whenever you load in. Sometimes the AI breaks down, sometimes items vanish from the ground, and sometimes the thing will just crash when you least expect it. Beyond that there are definitely balance issues with the weapons and combat, exacerbated by missions with no real difficulty curve to them that might send you into a hostile mercenary camp before you find anything more formidable than a sawed-off. The rough translated text might actually be the worst offender, hiding key information and names behind English one step above Google Translate in some cases.The Zone is a harsh and unforgiving place, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. exemplifies it right down to the code. It's going to take you a long time and multiple tries to acclimate to its unique style, and turning to modding isn't a bad idea if the base game is just too daunting or janky. But once you come to grips with the combat and start learning the many ways to die in the Zone, you're in for one hell of a ride. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. does immersion and atmosphere better than almost any FPS, presenting you with a rich, frightening, living world that will fight you every step of the way.			"

												I’m not here to suggest you into buying it. After browsing many reviews both there and on the Metacritic, I see STALKER as a moving train. You’re either hopped on it, or not.STALKER is not your usual big entertaining AAA-title, like Crysis or Call of Duty. It is more like living Monument. For my point of view, it is even bigger than Halo franchise.  Maybe bigger than Moby ♥♥♥♥ (the Whale). And with strong Russian accent. I’m not saying that only Russian-speakers can understand this scenery, but you really have to have somewhat specific system of values and behavioural pattern, to get in tune with that game. And what pattern it could be?Let me tell you where this game takes roots. It will be much better, than usual pro/contra stuff.Okay, first, there was a book. It was written by Strugatsky brothers and called “Roadside Picnic”. In there was painted our world after a brief impact with extraterrestrial civilization. Those aliens weren't contacted with people, they just used our planet as a campsite, and then disappeared in the space, while left some garbage at their leisure. The book’s story tells about some scientist who is researching that impact by studying strange alien artifacts, which can be recovered from abnormal zones aliens left behind. Due to its completely alien nature, the most of those “campsite” zones are extremely dangerous. Just like an oil puddle for ants.After filming that scenario, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, it turns out that the most natural and the most alive-looking character is not a day-dreaming scientist, wishing to make the world a better place. No, the main character of the movie was a simple guy, who dwelled the Zone by his instincts, intuition and luck, just for make a living for another day. The Stalker.No, that’s not the end of the history lesson. After that movie, Chernobyl catastrophe happened. It was really far from the resemblance with the “Roadside Picnic” events, but, after all impersonal cruelty that striked the territory around Chernobyl area, a big circle of the deadland was created, which fitted to the anomaly zone by its size and tragic background.And after that tragedy, there was a Soviet Union crush, which created so-called “roaming 90’s”. Ex-Soviet people, left in the dark age with squashed moral principles, which kept them together all soviet years, started a struggle of survival on the ruins of former life. It was then when bandits were ruled every activity, promising some outcome, preferably the fastest and dirtiest way possible.Finally, in the new millennia the governments of the former Union finally take some power back in their hands, so there was a time of peace in the 00’s in the Ukraine. Some talented people gather there and created a very powerful (yet not too stable) engine, and they blended Strugatsky, Tarkovsky, roaming 90’s under the shadow of Chernobyl zone…So, here you are: a simple man, who tries to get by and live another day, yet must adapt and survive in the hostile terrain. You hunt vile creatures, explore and getting used to the location, where every 10 straight steps leading you to another death trap. You collect some strange artifacts, survive encounters with bandits and hostile military forces, you helping some random and generic friendly stalkers (and even getting some help in return). And after some time, you feel yourself like at home there…Just like a soldier in his beloved trenches. Or a hunter in the wilderness, alone among wolves and bears. That’s a pattern of behaviour I was talking before. You’re not a hero in the shining armor, saving the world there. You just a survivalist, who’s getting stronger the harder fate trying to bend him. Without hope in government, in global order and justice, in helping hand from the Heaven… just to live another day.I know what not everybody could be like this. But Stalker game is giving so alive, so thrilling modus operandi that I know many people who played only in this videogame in the whole life.Inexpressible in words, unforgettable experience. Suspense. To kill or to be killed?Okay, enough with pathos. As a game, STALKER obviously has flaws. Frequent engine crushes, questionable features like constant respawn of enemies, narrow ravine between locations…But all this pales, when I remember how many time (even before Steam) I’ve spent there.So that game takes a mark 10/10 from me, for being like no other. A quintessence of a part of my life.			"

												An amazing game that you can fully immerse youself in, you'll find yourself looking around and the wondeful enviroments just as much as you will be trembling behind cover from bandits. The immersion in this game is just amazing, it's an experience you'll remember, and want to relive. With the help of mods (Helping the experience both graphics wise and gameplay) you'll probably relive the experience multiple times.If you enjoy this game, check out the others wich are just as good.

												cheeki breekiedit: apparently people have seen this so I feel like actually adding a reviewThis game is an atmospheric and spooky game that takes place in an alternate universe after the chernobyl incident. In this universe, the chernobyl incident created an ever expanding zone which produces deadly anomalies and horrifying creatures whose prey consist of you.You play as a STALKER, which basically is just a person who traverses the zone, who has suffered from some sort of amnesia. You only have one clear goal which is noted on your PDA: Kill Strelok.Who strelok is or why you need to kill him is unknown, but you pursue this goal in hopes of finding out why you are trying kill him and what happened to you.The game starts you in a small village with a simple goal of assisting nearby mecenaries in raiding a bandit camp, in hopes of retrieving a prisoner and a thumbdrive.It sets the tone of the game very well. You can choose to experience the more stealthy lethal approach or the loud and proud route by talking to the head merc and choosing either option.You get a quick feel for the tense gunplay (which I significantly recommend playing on max difficulty, it increases lethality for both sides during fights) and how the AI acts.The game in essence is great. Sorry if the review isnt in depth, but the game is rock solid 10/10.Though if you buy it know that you are supporting a person who practically tortured the dev team (who recieve no money from your purchase) and made them work in inhumane conditions. No matter what way you choose to get it, this game is worth your time.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time.Steam says I've only got 16 hours clocked in on this, but I bought this on disc as a teenager when it first came out in 2007, and probably have well over +100 hours otherwise. Back then it was so horribly buggy and unoptimized at launch, that even while playing on the lowest settings it still chugged at 15 fps and the load times were God-awful. But even then, I was so absorbed in the world that was created here, it was unlike anything I had ever played before, that I was still completely engaged.Now, ten years on, the game has so much more to offer. There are so many mods available that you can play through the game several times and get entirely different experiences every time. The combat is slow and somewhat tactical and requires patience, and the gameplay itself is clunky, and the difficulty is somewhere between challenging and outright punishing, but you'll never play a game like this again. This is Eastern European sci-fi horror/post apocolypse at its finest.			"

												Quite possibly one of the best FPS open world games I've played. The moment you start your game you enter an extremely immersive and atmospheric enviroment where your choices will shape how certain characters interact with you. Made even better by some of the survival horrror elements you will always be coming back for more. I highly recommend a clean playthrough for your first before installing any mods so you get that gritty introduction to the series. Be prepared for bugs though, as they're there, although some are not entirely gamebreaking, you will encounter problems. GET OUT OF HERE STALKER!			"

												A likeable open world game that is set in a post apocalyptic environment. It is  filled with merciless human scum, religious fanatics that wouldn't care less if a nonbeliever is to die, and vicious mutants. No matter where you go, the choices you make in fighting to survive can impact you.What the game did right:There are diverse NPCs that roam around the game. Their interactions with other friends/neutral characters and enemies are almost unscripted, thus making gameplay unique. The atmopshere of  S.T.A.L.K.E.R is unforgettable and is the most memoriable. The weather and ""day and night"" system constantly changes which can either make you relaxed or downright terrified. For example, enjoy being with other friendly/neutral characters by hanging around with them near a fire or be trembling in fear within a dark underground system. You can't relax for a couple of seconds when bypassing enemy lines or breaching a room that could be filled with a hostile mutant. Combat in this game will never bore you, and can be just as brutal. As a result, you can't just rush in with guns blazing if sufficient support is nonexistant as a shotgun to the face is lethal, even on easy difficulty. There's plenty of weapons in this game, Expand your average arsenal to a powerful gauss rifle or a grenade launcher. Show no mercy and obliterate your foes to mere chunks of flesh. Upgraded weapons are also present which are usually different from their ordinary cousins. The concept of artifacts and anomalies are intriguing. Equip some and you can sprint iinfinitely (if you are light enough) or regenerate health. Treasure hunters will love this, no doubt about it. Main tasks can be delayed to complete other smaller tasks to obtain money or simply explore the landscape. Unlike most games, how and where you move can impact your survival. Sneaking through bushes can allow you to remain concealed but creates sounds. Even if limited, the community of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has been dedicated to modding, thus you can seek to replace your weapon skins or expand your experience with the Zone. I did love this game but many issues, like technical problems, didn't make me favor this game overall. What the game should have fixed/improved on:S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is plagued with bugs and glitches. This really hampers on how enjoyable the game is. Some objectives aren't possible to complete or can confuse and frustrate players. For me, the worst bug I encountered was being forced to fight hostile loners in the Duty base and after killing them, I had a mix of Duty members who were friends and enemies. This game also stutters quite often, which isn't present in Clear Sky. Some good weapons are (almost) impossible to obtain, because they were cut from the game, are only avaliable at certain places/vendors, or must be taken by killing certain NPCs.Adding to the aforementioned problem, weapons and armor degrade over time, especially unique equipment. You can repair armor with the right artifacts and specific anomaly but weapons have to be replaced. Moreover, this game has a ""weapon jam"" system thus one has to eventually give in and buy a new firearm or can get lucky by salvaging a pristine weapon off a dead enemy. The weight limit can become very annoying. Often times, the limit in carrying weapons is 3 and it's painful to go back to a stash that has more suitable weapons when you cannot win a fight if the right firearms are not present. Despite claiming to be a RPG game, players have very little choice in implementing free will in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. In other words, you're forced to play as the same character without making any decisions that can change the storyline. Stealth in this game is fairly broken. Enemies may still notice you, even if one is to quietly move around or sneak behind a target, while other times an NPC can be killed but other AI controlled characters will not notice it. Certain NPCs can be made into friends by helping them when wounded or doing certain tasks but there's barely any difference when they were originally neutral to you. It's a shame that you can't recruit them to fight alongside your presence. In many cases, how NPCs spawn (or where you enter a map) is often stupid. One time, I exited out fo the underground and a group of bandits greeted me by killing me instantly and I couldn't do anything. Other times, killed foes are out of the map boundaries which makes looting their corpses impossible.Furthermore, even though some enemies are supposed to ignore the player and fight each other, they may actually team up and attempt to kill you, such as when mutants are fighting mercenaries. The minor tasks in this game have a time limit (one day of game time). This is a problem because some jobs take a lot of time to complete (such as eliminating ALL members of an opposing force without help or going to the other side of the map). Moreover, you have to claim a reward quickly otherwise, you will be penalized and your reputation may go down (though, because of the huge glitches, it probably won't matter that much as it constantly changes). Shamefully, you cannot fast travel. Some argue it should not be implemented in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but the Zone is huge and to make a simple trip can take a long time, due to the dangers that are present in a pathway.Finally, the plot is just ok. It has good suspense but it's pretty slow (depending on how fast you want to pass through the game) and the exploration can be distracting. Other:Multiplayer is still around, but there's only a few servers that have just a handful of players. For me, they all have a ping of more than 200. Conclusion:The game is overpriced, considering the bugs that the game suffers from. It should have priced at either $10 or $15. If it wasn't for that, I would highly recommend this game. You can try to mod this game but beyond changing the skins of textures, you are more likely to face crashes than success. In the end, it's a good game if you can get pass through the cons that I mentioned.			"

												People are creating reviews on why this game is hard and the aspects of why so i figure i'll make one to and my viewpoints on why. First off, the game isn't very hard in the combat area once you learn the how to do the combat, once thing is, you'll die, a lot in the beginning and a little more when automatics are introduced BUT combat is also fun for the fact that it's unpredictable in a sense. Where did that bandit go that you were firing at? Well he din't stand still like every other (low end) shooter out there, he coordinated with his allies and moved to a position where they could out flank you. Now where I find it challenging is keeping another friendly npc alive. So far into my four hour gameplay almost all ""quest"" npcs have died, but dont worry because it has alternates incase of this happening. Never played a Stalker game but i can kill more by myself than with a four man team. Dont get me wrong, I've been having a hell of a time having fun here but dear god, can this game be unforgiving. It's a great 8/10 game for people who like games where they don't hold your hand in survival but if your edgy or freak out if you die with very little explaination on how, it isn't very recommended. Now I highly doubt somebody's actually reading this so as bonus for reading this review, you get this invisible potato from the zone, giving you +20 radiation but infinite health bonus, enjoy the game ;).

												Quite possibly the best game I have played in a long while. The game itself is challenging with loads of NPCs who are quite capable of giving you a run for your money. They will almost always try to stay in cover and even flank you (including mutants). The game offers a massive open world with a variety of places to explore. The storyline is marvelous, full of intrigue and is guaranteed to get you hooked and the variety of side quests will never let you get bored. Various factions react differently to your actions so keeping all of the Zone happy is tricky, but well worth it.The shooting part of the game is realistic. Weapons can get stuck and can shoot blanks as well. From afar you won’t be able to hit jack ♥♥♥♥, but point blank, damage output is massive (especially with shotguns, go figure).There are a few bugs, I am not gonna lie, such as some graphic issues, NPCs can get stuck inside of walls and obstacles etc.And of course, best Cheeki Breeki experience.Bottom line, if you’re looking for a good story and a game where you can explore I would highly recommend this as pros largely outweigh the cons. 9/10  "

												It's the year 2013 close to 2014 now and this is still my favourite game. You start as a guy who lost his memory and all you have is a STALKER tatoo on your forearm and a PDA with the task ""KILL THE STRELOK"".The game offers a great fps experience with some rpg elements combined with a great variety of weapons,suits and medium sized maps filled with mutanats, anomalies and dangerous underground laboratories that host mutated experiments and documents that clear things out for people in the Zone. The Zone is the closed area around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant where this game takes place. The Zone is split in different places controlled by factions that you can ignore,attack or help but beware, once you attack 1 npc from that faction you're going to be at war with them and they will attack you on sight.(except The Monolith faction, they are enemies to all) During gameplay the user will encounter strange glowing balls in the fields or near anomalies, these are called artefacts and can be used to boost your resists.By following the quest line you will find out the true meaning of your forearm tatoo,the reason of The Zone and how The Zone was created. It may seem logical to do all the main quests but it becomes tricky at a certain point and people seem to ignore this part and just move forward.This leads to the 5 false endings  but if the user pays attention he is rewarded with extra gameplay, 2 more endings and THE TRUTH behind all of this.Yes the game has 7 endings, the 2 real endings and 5 false endings based on decisions throughout the game ( check Google for decisions ).People usually ignore this game when they see Release Date: 20 Mar 2007, good,their mistake.Personally I recommend new players to play this game vanilla and get the real taste of being a STALKER after that you can patch it and have fun, enjoy better textures and explore every corner of The Zone.Pros-all from aboveCons-some bugs-can fall out of game map in certain areas-too easy to get money,med kits,bandages etc.-in cleared areas mutants/npcs respawn probably killing some of your ""friends""-no way to repair weapons/suits (except mods ) etc.BUT this is no problem for a true STAKLER.Now GET OUT OF HERE STALKER and play the game.

												This game was awesome at the time of release and perhaps still is. Sure the graphics are outdated, but it's still fun and they patched most of the bugs. What still holds up is the AI. It's cunning and challenging as it tries to surround you and flank your position. Sometimes when I see two groups fighting each other, I just sit back and watch them fight. The environment is just spectacular and very immersive! If you're a post-nuclear apocalyptic FPS fan you owe yourself to try out this game.

Gameplay+ Good simple HUD.+ A shop trading system.+ Inventory system and looting.+ Controls are fully alright and work fine.+ Different types of mutants a great addition.+ Scary at times, keeps the direction perfect.+ Requires skills and tactics as well taking cover.+ Weapons are solid and actually similar to real guns.+ No level system bs. It makes the immersion more real.+ Mod support. Many mods to make it even more greater.+ One of the most atmospheric games, it feels like you are there.+ Guns have conditions the more worse quality the more the jamming.+ Artifacts can be used to enchance some statistics or sold for money.+ Ahh just lay down in the campfire eat sausages and listen to guitar with fellow stalkers.+ You can still occiasnly find multiplayer matche's due to the fact that people can host there own.- Few side quests.- Not true open-world.- Loading times can get long.- No weapon or armor upgrading.- Some guns really can use many improvements.- No engaging tutorial, only text pretty barebone's.- No fast traveling, requiring you to walk back many times.- Bugs and many of them luckily there are mods that fix emm.- Many artifacts are just scrambled around and require no real work to get.Graphics+ Overall graphics are pretty fine and good.+ Lighting effects are amazing just a well done job- Textures can use many improvements.A.I（Artificial intelligence )+ Every mutant behaves in different ways thus adding variation.+ Just amazing, they take cover,they try to flank you and have a mind.+ The world A.i is always on i mean suppose you are in other area if you go back to other ones different things can happen like for say a loner camp and now a group of bloodsuckers attacked it.- Buggy,buggy A.i while what it does is amazing but many times just buggs ethier they will get stucked at a certain position, not respond or come and many more.Story+ Immersion and real immersion.+ A unique while a bit super natural story.+ Great voice acting matches every character.+ A believable world and based on an actual location.+ Many turning points and just keeps wanting you to play.- While can be alot confusing for starters.Design+ Overall environment really just great.+ Well designed world and actually does seem believable.+ Overall presentation is great already gives you a feeling of pure bitterness.- Many generic and poor design decisions.Sounds and OST+ Environmental sounds are just amazing.+ Guns,walking and all that have great sounds+ Great guitar-tracks keeps you listening even more.+ Menu music and all in between may seem odd but fully matching.- Dynamic music option. It's really not that great mostly just really lame.ConclusionA hella great game but more of a experience. Well directed,good voice acting,solid guns,many realistic elements, tactical, good A.I,Different mutants while some poor design decisions and many bugs and missing features.			"

												Stalker is a series that is somehow both ahead of its time and dated simultaneously. Graphically the game isn't, and never was, the hottest thing on the market. However, the world that they dev. team have created is one of the most genuinely sinister and oppressive that I have ever experienced in a game. The creatures are disturbing and dangerous, and the lighting (particularly in the darkness) effectively creates a creeping, relentless tension. The moment in the tunnels when you look back and see the silhouette of the Controller emerge for the first time (seasoned players will know what I mean) is one of the most unnerving experiences I can recall having.Like all the games in the series, Stalker doesn't coddle its players. Starting the game is quite brutal as it can take a new player some time to come to grips to the realism of the gunplay and the initially unforgiving difficulty of the enemies. The bullet physics are realistic in that your weapons aren't perfectly accurate, nor are they entirely reliable, and misfires can be common with weapons of a low condition, so you must use your brain and know your weapons and their limitations before initiating a firefight. In saying that, the game rewards the player by lightening the load as you progress and get better weapons and armour, and by the mid-point the difficulty can lessen considerably.The sound is here and there in terms of quality, with the voice acting being average and flat a lot of the time, however, the atmospheric sound, weapon sounds, and THAT droning voice towards the end (seasoned players will understand), really plant a disturbing and terrifying chill in your spine the whole way through. Voice acting aside, the sound in these games are one of my favourite parts. Stalker: SoC is a game I keep coming back to replay again and again, not in the least because of the quality of the mods out there. In saying that, the world that the devs have created and the emotions that that world inspires in me remains with me for long after every play session, and I think that, once one gets past the initial hurdles that the game places in front of you, this is one of the best post-apocalyptic games I've ever played. I feel that, whereas classics like Bioshock (for a random example) are fantastic games that appeal to everyone, cult classics are fantastic games that are an acquired taste. This is very much, in my mind, the absolute definition of cult classic. I highly recommend it (with a good mod like COMPLETE if you wish to smooth the creases out) to anyone looking for a deep, memorable and unsettling FPS experience.			"

												Honestly, I understand not everyone may like it, its dated and at times clunky or cheesey, confusing even and sometimes frustrating, but if youre able to overlook the simple flaws it has, beneath is an incredible gem of a game.Its based (very loosely) on the Russian novel ""Roadside Picnic"" by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.(Which is a fantastic novel Id also recommend)I have yet to play the sequels but Ive heard this is the best of the games. There is also a movie titled ""stalker"" that once again loosely shares a similar plot to the games and novel.The atmosphere and chills the game produces is fantastic.It actually scared me senseless at sometimes and the enemies you fight are unique and interesting, even if you may tire of killing them over and over as there isnt too much variety, but the game remains fresh by supplying you with new weapons, locations, items, artifacts, armour and other loot that keeps you sastified throughout your playthrough.The look of the Zone and the areas around it are incredible. You feel a sense of dread and fascination as you walk into open areas filled with destroyed facilities, communications stations, army bases, abandoned towns and villages, Stalker camps and strongeholds, safe zones and pieces of land scorched by anomalies that will turn you into paste or burn you alive.Very fun exploration too as the Zone just looks great. Collecting artifacts and making profit feels rewarding and the battles are nerve gripping at times. Play with headphones at night for best experience (seriously though)There are basic survival needs as well, the character must eat periodically, bandages are used to stop bleeding, medkits heal greater wounds and later on radiation, infections, burns etc. Some enviromental suits protect against these things too. Different ammo types for practically every type of weapon..I could go on and on, but you really should just try it for yourself!Definitely worth it!It usually goes on sale quite often too, so grab it during one and youll save a bunch!

												Let´s start. Why is this my favorite game of all time? The answer is quite easy. It has everything I expect from a top notch shooter. It has unique compelling gameplay, the most immersive atmosphere I ever experienced in a videogame, it´s open world and it has addictive RPG elements. Even factions and a really great story. The reason this game flawed was that it had so many bugs. FREAKIN MANY. After years of patching and fanpatches it finally become stable and accessible for casuals. I don´t recommend to play it without thecommunity fixes which are called ""Zone Reclamation Project"" since I´m not sure if you would like purest vanilla of da stalker. Let´s go into the details and sort it out for you.Graphics, Technical Aspects:The original Stalker was really great looking but it already had its weaknesses. While textures and dynamic lighting were fantastic, the lighting in specific is even better than in some modenr games due to it being 100% real time but the animations and graphical bugs were bad though. Shadows were sometimes really ugly and unrealistic but it was rarer. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky though had some sick high shadow resolutions and realistic lighting! Beautiful landscapes setting the mood perfectly in all of the Stalker games. Back to SoC. Textures were really High Res for it´s time and everything else was top notch too. Animations were mostly robotic but they didn´t give you eye cancer. Guns were looking good and the skybox was incredible. The game was oozing with atmosphere and east european charm. It felt immersive and realistic. The complete mod even made the game looking sweet for today´s standards, adding bump mapping and steep parallax at buildings and streets. They worked and made the game even more immersive and realistic. With Complete Mod 2012 it looks polished and very good but it also overhauls the game balancing too much and make it too easy for the game´s survival aspect. There was also the single core focused engine and the sun shadow bug. The game loses it´s beautiful lighting if you turn off Sun Shadow since it´s turning off the sun. Dumb. It still looks amazing though. I don´t know if the Complete Mod fixed this graphic bug for everyone. It´s a shame that the engine creates this bug with newer graphic cards and drivers. World, Atmosphere, AI, Gameplay and Locations:Like said, the landscapes were breathtaking and are still beautiful today if updated with the Complete Mod and even more so with Autumn Aurora 2.1. The atmosphere is already explained: It´s stunning and immersive, it won´t let you go away. It grabs you and whispers you in your ear: ""I know you love me, I saw you fapping. Marry me!"" Nuff said. The combination between the world, the free roaming AI, gripping atmosphere and RPG elements (which I will discuss later on in my review) are going hand in hand, creating one of the best gaming experiences I ever had. It builds Nostalgia like a chinese construction worker builds a skyscraper even if the game balancing was quite unbalanced at some points and had some quest breaking bugs. Side quests only though. Devs made sure the main missions work. Autumn Aurora though has a endgame bug where a save goies corrupt. So be aware with Autumn Aurora and save alot.I have to tell you about the AI though. It was the problem many had with this game. It was bugged, unpredictable and just plain bad. Just quicksave often. Yes this game is so oldschool it still has the good old quicksave function and due to tough fights it´s necessary. I don´t know why it died. It´s a useful feature even for today´s times. Consoles.... And in this game it´s an elementary function to avoid frustration and anger. ^^´. Finished 3 dudes without having a scratch? Quicksave. Or don´t do it and make it extra hard for yourself. The locations are self explained. Eastern European places like industrial complexes and open places with borders, huge dumps of metallic garbage, discarded train stations, underground research labs with secret experiments, etc....and of course the highlights. PRIPYAT AND THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. Atmosphere overdose. Especially at night with all the terrifying mutants around you.Even though the AI can be stupid as ♥♥♥♥ sometimes, as long as they don´t wallhack and annoy the crap out of you with their deadly accuracy and one hit headshot deaths, they are sometimes even very smart, taking cover, throwing grenades, luring you out of covers and sometimes even silently flanking you. It´s a very strange AI. Definitely better than this linear CoD campaign AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and a lot, A LOT more thrilling and challenging than in most games. Different enemy types from different factions, fighting each other and you of course. Establishing a great universe. The gunplay needs an overhaul with Autumn Aurora or Arsenal Overhaul though as it´s issue with more inaccurate weapons were that the bullets sprayed too randomly to have fake sprays in and out of ADS to simulate the weapon weathering as guns have health, as does armor,etc. It takes too long talking about every gameplay aspect here, watch a youtube vid. Because there are so many hella lot of aspects. I just told you the only big issue with gunplay, the rest is fine but can be improved with recommended mods really. It´s fun with vanilla already, but with mods it´s absolutely epic and godlike. Check out this as an example, not a recommendation as there are better ones outthere: 


YouTube™ Video: Stalker shadow of chernobyl fotograf + weapons mod 

			Views: 19,850		

			Here is a show case of some the weapons in the mod. NOTE: Professor Kruglov mission ""place detectors in anomalies"" has a bug where you cannot not complete it.		

If you intend to mod make sure to inform yourself properly and backup your files.  Modding is worth it but can be difficult sometimes and generally wonky too if done not properly. Depends from mod to mod.Horror, Survival, RPG Elements and Dialogues:The atmosphere brings up a more unknown part of the game. Horror. At some parts this game freaked me out, even though after I played several horror games very often. Mutants like the bloodsuckers which can make themselves invisible, are giving you the creeps. A strong paranoia is common in quiet parts. Cry of fearish. Combined with the RPG elements it makes a great survival game too. You have an inventory you need to manage. Different ammunition types with different effects, many guns and a lot of different calibers, suppressors, scopes, modifications, PDA with quests and even an ingame encyclopedia. What I want to say is that this game has a lot of content and the game length is easily 20 hrs if you mod... it grow infinite. The dialogue in the game is good at most times and often even funny but you have to read, ok? There are voiced ones but mostly you have to read. So have patience or skip but then miss out on the most of the story. You can miss SO MUCH by skipping. And yes the dialogue isn´t much, loads of reading and it can be ome bad writing, but it non the less grips and entertains everytime.Endings:There are several endings. The bad ending with the wishgranter and the true endings. In order to save your ♥♥♥ from getting the bad ending or the bad true ending follow these steps:Do your side missions. Not the small quests, only major sidequests. Before going to the brainscorcher, meet with the guide in order to get to meet the doctor. The true true ending can only be achieved by not agreeing with a certain nature to join their program. The rest would be spoiling.Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat:Shadow of Chernobyl is the best part for beginners and rookie stalkers to begin with. Don´t go into the other two since Call of Pripyat has a totally different story and Clear Sky needs some knowledge as it´s an prequel that connects storywise to Shadow of Chernobyl in its own way.Conclusion:Low priced highly moddable masterpiece with quite the flaws that still shines brighter than a shooting star at the ukrainian nightsky. Grab if you feel like loving and entering the genius art and world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.			"

												Rare that a game define a country. I have played games for many years but when it comes down to russian made game. The only one that really coming to my mind is the STALKER serie. There are other russian games out there but this one is the russian game that you must play to learn about the russian people.IT's crude and proud, Unforgiving yet full of hidden beauty, Tough to understand yet Interesting and engaging. This is a very intersting game made by very interesting russian developer. Think it as openworld skyrim with guns, quest and mystery to discover!Stilll much and much for me to proceed and discover after over 17 hours of playing. I learn my lesson to save often as it's very unforgiving at times. Control is  quite smooth, the weight system is a bit hard to manage for me as i run out of energy running just about every 5 minutes. The anomely and random encounter made this game quite slow paced. There are some bugs there but nothing too major, 17 hours and only hard crushed once.9/10 still for awesome russian game and it's a wonder open-world FPS to recommend to all FPS gamers. "

												I’ve been playing this classic gem for years and years. Shadow of Chernobyl is a gritty, survival focused FPS which puts atmosphere and gameplay above all else. Although not a true RPG, there are various elements which RPG lovers will appreciate such as an extensive inventory system, and quest based missions. The vanilla game itself is fairly basic, but the sheer amount of large mods available give this game so much life/replayability. Three in particular that I have enjoyed are:Lost AlphaOblivion Lost U.L.T.I.M.A.T.E.[stalker.filefront.com]Autumn Aurora 2This game is something no gamer should miss. Although not everyone will appreciate it as much as me, I still recommend that everyone give it a go. Definitely with the Lost Alpha mod installed <3 Hopefully you’ll like it as much as I do!  "

												If you like Fallout 3, NV, 4 and think ""Oh this is Russian Fallout xDDD"" and decide to buy it. Youre wrong. You will die. This game is unlike any survival game I have ever played. You know nothing of whats going on, only find and kill a man. The Zone is one of the spookiest environments of any game ive ever played because of how much this game takes me in. If you want a good, harsh survival experience, buy this game. If you want foofoo bunny survival, go buy Fallout 4 and play on survival difficulty.			"

												Hundreds of hours invested in this on the disc version purchased many moons ago. STALKER is a bleak, nightmareish vision brought to life even more so with the huge collection of community made mods available. This was the first game in the trilogy of games the other two being Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky (a prequal). Both of which are also incredible, CoP more so.When you leave the Cordon for the first time after speaking to Wolf, walking up that path towards the road, turning and seeing your brothers slowly disappear into the distance, hearing the wind howl around the barrel of your creaky old shotgun, suddenly hearing some sort of demonic cry far away to the east and a chill creeps down your back. The sun is low in the musty sky - but just up ahead there is an old abandoned mill to explore, just make use of the fading light.For me this game creates an atmosphere I've never felt before (or since, other STALKER titles not including) of a world gone to hell - the Zone, a huge area of land around the defunct Chernobyl reactor, now infested with nightmareish creatures deformed by radiation, different collections of (human) mostly factions wanting to kill you on sight and rob your last tin of tuna. Secret underground labs where horrific experiments happened before everything went to hell. Deserted farm buildings where blood hungry things lurk in the dark. STALKER is all about tension and fear, but also survival.There are mods you can get that improve just about every aspect of the original game, textures, weapons, music, audio, bugs ironed out, even previously unnavailble areas.I love STALKER, it's tremendously satisfying to survive in the Zone, it's terrifying, compelling and full of detail (if you also read all of lore/diary entries that Marked One enters into your PDA throughout the game.For anybody that likes FPS/open world survival shooters with strong RPG elements, for anybody that loves to become really immersed in their chosen universe, there is nothing quite like STALKER.Just don't forget your anti rads, and take care of Nimble - he's worth it.

												With one of the greatest cult followings of all time, fantastic mod support, a wonderful setting, and cheesy Russian voice acting, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is one that may have been surpassed by some, but is definitely worth the $15. Like most post-apoctalyptic games, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s harsh Russian wasteland and mutated animals provide a brooding backdrop for the game. However, unlike most games of the genre, this one's story is something that brings a little extra novelty to the game (the game is based off of the 1972 classic, Roadside Picnic.[www.amazon.com]) Along with this, there was also a movie, which is aptly named Stalker, which was released in 1979. You can read more about that here.[www.imdb.com] The story revolves around the Chernobyl nuclear diasaster in 1986. In the story, the radiation spread much quicker, the effects being much more devastating. Now, radiation storms and rocks, all under the name ""anomalies"", were scattered across the landscape. To get more into the actual game, the gunplay is actually somewhat satisfying. The game is a first person shooter, with elements of an inventory, as well as enemies dropping rare weapons, or better weapons, as well as food, bandages, etc. Akin to games such as DayZ or Arma, the shooting mechanics are meant to be more realistic in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. You bleed at various severities depending on where and how much you have been hit, and you must use bandages to stop the bleeding and heal yourself (food is another option to regain health). Your gun can (and will) jam, and ammo is scarce (even scarcer with some friendly mods). The AI is probably the most lacking of all the gameplay aspects, as their grenade lobbing and intense corner camping can lead to some awkward firefights (the quicksave button is nice). The game revolves around this faction, known as Stalkers. These are freelance men, almost like prospectors, to find valuables deep within the Zone (the area in and around the Chernobyl factory.) Being a Stalker is a dangerous job, which can turn many to a darker side. The Russian Army has become a shell of its former self, now a greedy army looking for power. Factions such as the Duty attempt to rally against this army. Like any good post-apoc game, there are of course low level mercaneries too, there to spoil the fun and become some nice target practice. There are of course more factions, but why spoil them all here? You can read all about them in the ingame PDA. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. holds a place dear in my heart. Many have played it, and it is definitely an inspiration for many popular games today. The definition of a cult classic, this game (as well as the series) is something to be cherished.			"

												Classic game from 2007 Inspired by the book called Roadside Picnic, cult following is still active to this day and refining and redesigning everything there is S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Before anything else, the retail russian copies of Shadow of Chernobyl came with patches 1.0001/2 and filled with absolutely everything worst to have in a game, bugs, crashes, gamebreaking issues as time went on other european countries and the US have their on retail CD's of stalker containing patch 1.0005/6 but essentially have fixed various things from 3 and 4, 1.0005 and 6 were only multiplayer patches and fixes.Don't be dithered on trying the game out as its old, graphics is grody, not more 'user' friendly as newer games. as I can say Shadow of Chernobyl's lighting, weather, god rays, particle effects absolutely can blow any modern games out of the water being well done even on vanilla.  Alot of veterans would say ""atmosphere this, atmosphere that, atmosphere everywhere!"" Yes, that is the case. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s atmosphere is the selling point of the game with dynamic A-LIFE(AI) going on about the map/level things are dynamic, life goes on every hour and minute, your buddies, friends, fellow faction member can die at any given and they will not stand around in a spot like most games, Various quest and task can fail if ignored or levels can be and will be more harder if everything is well. The first instances the game treats you as another soul not knowing what to do in the game, Do not worry You will die and die until you realize you can be doing things much more faster and efficient. The AI in this game is different from others, They can be Amazing and shoot their sawn offs across the horizons or bug out and get stuck in various forms of hilarity but that does not hinder them from being difficult. The zone is a dangerous place, pockets of radiation lingering, uneven ground, chemical spills or ""Anomalies"" that produces different kinds of hazards and also produces rare things called ""Artifacts"" that gives off various stat changes like take less bleeding, absorbing radiation with some having negative effects to counteract the positives. New players will have a gripe on how hard the game is or have no clue on what to do from the realism and gunplay as you will need to try to get another tier before leaving rookie village. ALOT of people will suggest to install mods like complete mod to even out the game and make it more decent but I will ask you to refrain from doing that as it ruins the fun and gameplay of stalker while yes people have opinions on it and the base game itself I will not judge you but I will say that if you did install complete mod there is two snorks profusely laughing and shaking their heads from the doing you have made while a bandit spinning in a whirligig is laughing and saying ""AH, SHYA MI WAM ARATI NIDALENIJINI"" before exploding. Mod talkI must say that it does take some brain to actually edit stuff and play around with configs and actually test you if you know how to use a keyboard besides eating paste and drinking mountain dew as you call in airstrikes for your yearly rehash game. Almost anything can be done in stalker, don't like the vanilla UI or making it more minimal? edit the HUD files. Want your guy to hide his weapon when healing? Edit the .ltx. Do you want another game that looks totally different from stalker altogether? Go crazy and feel the magic.While the average player would not really touch this second and disregard it as they just want to play their games as touching this section of your game will be absolutely life changing, You will not look at stalker the same way as before your first playthrough. some may suggest Autumn Aurora 2 for Shadow of Chernobyl if they absolutely refuse to play vanilla/ZRP(Zone Reclamation Project) for their first being AA2 is an upgrade on graphics and gunplay, there are many mods such as Doom's Mod Merge, or Zone of Alienation even STALKERSOUP that added kitchen sinks. There are hundreds of untranslated mod for stalker in ap-pro or any other stalker sites that could be categorize as bad, decent, decently bad or amazing. 99% of the time spent for stalker is modding[puu.sh] your game to have mods on top of mods and making it work, As after you're done it will be amazing and fun, catered to your liking.if anything I will absolutely say S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is PC gaming at its finest, this is what is all about, modding to the extent new content is still being made after years and various iterations and improvements the community has given to the series, Really wonderful and talented people.Helpful stuffSo you want to buy stalker? if possible, get the GoG[www.gog.com] version or you already got the game? redeem a non DRM version for free here[www.gog.com]Can someone explain what all of this in the HUD mean?[a.pomf.cat]Game Modificationhttp://www.moddb.com/games/stalkerZone Reclamation Projecthttp://www.metacognix.com/stlkrsoc/index.htmlZone Survival Guidehttp://zsg.dk/Guide by Spartan and dusty_thoreau

			So, you just stepped into a Steam sale, or someone has gifted you S.T.A.L.K.E.R. eh? Well, maybe we can help you. Just pour yourself a glass of Cossacks Vodka, and pray you survive the next blowout, rookie.		


Set your game difficulty on masters for immersion and actual difficulty. Remove crosshairs, you do not need it. (optional) disable map radar via hud edits, you do not need it but some people would like to see where they are or dead bodies(map tells the story more than anything)Good hunting, stalker enjoy the zone and have a great time. (wew, shameless plug here, I do encourage people to be self reliant, get into stalker modding, and help others if they have game problems)			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is the ultimate survival game. It does not care to help you, or try to make your time fun and in fact will sometimes even send in troops to wipe out your ""safe"" starting point. I'm still not sure what agitated them that much, they were relentless and wiped out everything except the trader. Things happen in the world without your involvement.Anyway, assuming that weirdness doesn't happen to you, surviving in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is actually a real effort, and you can feel good about yourself for living that one extra hour each time you play. Or even that one extra minute.10/10 for surprise deaths.			"

												Hi there. I'm Jack. And i'm a little late with this game.This is going to be my review about the game.I gotta say, the cheeki never goes without the breeki.No, real talk right now. Gameplay & Storywise: The game is amazing, the story is clever, the messages in the game are really good, and i even teared up when it was a rainy day and i was playing this game... Depressive, but beautiful... I have NEVER played a game with such a clever storyline before, i'm completely ♥♥♥♥ing addicted. I'll review this game through my own eyes right now, but i feel like everyone should know about this. Pros: 1. Deep and impressive story, i legit cried halfway through the game.2. Amazing atmosphere, i felt really lonely and scared while playing, that's a good thing.3. Some really great enemies and a clever setting.4. The areas are amazing, i  LOVE  the maps.5. The enemies are hard to fight, but that's also a good thing, right?6. The birth of the Cheeki Breeki, Get out of here Stalker, etc :)  Cons: 1. THERE ARE NO CONS. Seriously, the bugs and glitches that are in the game are supposed to be in there. S.T.A.L.K.E.R without bugs is not a S.T.A.L.K.E.R game. You need those bugs in order to play this game, right? No bugs = no S.T.A.L.K.E.R. That's why we need another S.T.A.L.K.E.R game, am i right? EPILOGUE You've just read the review of one of the greatest games ever. This game really helped me think twice before making a decision, because i have autism. It really made me know myself and become who i really am. I changed a LOT since i played this game, and buying this game was actually a life decision. I reccomend it to ANYONE. NOW, GET OUT OF HERE, STALKER!  #NEVERFORGET. Spam this hashtag to everyone you care about :)  "

												The world of STALKER is a dark, damp place full of mutants that work in packs and are well-capable of making you regret stumbling into their poorly demarked territory. Half the population hates your guts, the other half is getting mauled by mutants and bandits, you soak up radiation like a sponge, your weapons jam, you run out of ammo, get hungy and tired and sleep the rest of the day away on a moldy matress in the basement of the merc camp you just ""liberated.""

												I used to hate this game, really I did. But I decided to give it another chance, and, I motherfudging love this game.Can't beleive I used to hate this game to be honest, I just love how the mechanics work and the general gameplay is enjoyable.The general disaproval of my original review (that was negative, bashing the game for the wrong reasons) persuaded me to give it another go, and I'm glad I did.____________________________________________________________Pros:Cheeki Breeki.Great combat.Good ladder physics (I hate using ladders in the normal valve game, I'll slip and fall down to my death, or get gravely injured 9 times out of ten, but I never got screwed over by a ladder in this game before.)Fantastic weapons.Decent graphics.Cool storyline (I originally thought it was boring, but at the time I never really got too involved in the storyline in the first place, you need to actually be invested in the tale itself, to be willing to experience it, in order to enjoy the story.)Voiceacting is usually good, there are a few lines that are cheesy and a little underdone, but it's overall enjoyable.Clothing and armor systems are very well made, the fact that you have to scavenge and trade for armors or be naked against the vicious wastelands just adds to the tension, which I will get to later.Challenge: this was originally something I hated about the game, but I realised that living in a nuclear infested wasteland, in the middle of Northern Ukraine wouldn't be so easy. And it isn't.Tension: I constantly find myself with my face glued to the screen, focusing on capturing a bandits' base, or clearing a military site from all inhabitants. The general suspence of the story and action gives a good vibe and leaves you wanting more.Food mechanics: Usually games have an out of place or annoying way to tell you that you are litterally dying of malnutrition. Beeping, etc. There would normally be a huge bar or meter that takes up 50% of your hud and just sits there ticking away, dangling over your head.While SoC likes to just display a tiny window telling you to eat. And when you eat, it goes away. Simple.Scare Factor: I originally disliked the scare factor and claimed it wasn't scary at all, butthat was before I got into the underground levels. My seat has the urination of 7+ underground levels soaked into it.First impression: First time I played this game I just looked at the begining cutscene, uninterested, unhyped.I didn't even pay attention to it, I just critisized and gawked at the old graphics and continued on my marry little way.But I never analyzed it for what it was, and now that I have I give it a good rating.____________________________________________________________Cons:Questionable physics engine, Props, corpses and objects will slide and bump around sometimes, breaking immersion and generaly being buggy.Silly and dumb AI. Usually I'll find bandits or military personel, mutants, friendlies, etc. Staring at walls, shooting ceilings, crouching for no good reason. Sometimes I'll see them killing themselves or other friends really for no actual reason, either. Other times they'll be shouting and screaming while crouched in a corner. The AI really act strange during combat, even not in combat as well.Enemies, including mutants, will sometimes be in the middle of attacking me and suddenly not care, strolling in the other direction like nothing happened, in their normal voices and walking as if in a passive enviroment. Even during heated gunfights with other npcs, there will always be at least one guy strolling around like there arent grenades and bullets flying past his head.One time. I started killing a few bandits near a fire, and as I offed them, the remaining 4 started shouting combat lines, shooting at me, flinching from gunfire, all behaving normally during a gunfight, as they should. Suddenly, they hostler their guns, turn around, and sit near the fire, singing, laughing, playing instruments, drinking vodka, eating sausages, talking to eachother and joking.  While I had just killed their entire squad in front of them I proceeded to jump in front of them and they continued and even made eye contact with me, I shot one of them in the foot, ran in circles around them and they still never moved an inch. I got fed up and threw a grenade at one of them. They still continued to act idly as they shouted their grenade lines, still sitting down, exploded and died.____________________________________________________________This is where the Review ends, my conclusion as that this is an overall great game, a strong 9.3/10  TL;DR section: Dis game is güd, now go buy it with money.

												Awesome open-world FPS.  A little rough around the edges and glitchy, but still a great game.  The game is over 7 years old, so it is a little dated as well.  The game takes place in ""The Zone"", referring to the uninhabitable area surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear power station.  You start the game as a man with amnesia.  Throughout the game, you try to piece together who you are.  Within The Zone, there are anomalies, bandits, mutants, and treasure.  You have a lot of choice in the game.   You can use something loud like an AK-47 or you can try and be stealthy. The only real problem I have with this game (besides the glitches and other bugs) is that it is very difficult at the start.  You start with a pistol and some food, so it is difficult to kill the bandits/soldiers who have much better weapons than you at the start of the game. Overall, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a flawed yet fun open-world FPS.			"

												The first STALKER game, and the one that kicked off an amazing franchise. SOC is quite rough, but well worth playing through.SOC is a fairly non-linear FPS with light RPG elements. RPG elements are mostly in the form of an inventory system and NPCs to converse with. Character progression is purely in the form of equipment, as you progress through the game you will find better weapons, outfits and artifacts (radioactive items that grant small defensive bonuses). There are plenty of side quests, mostly taking the form of repetitive fetch quests, but sometimes more complex.What really sets the STALKER series apart from most games is the amazing atmosphere. The game has an extremely bleak and depressing atmosphere. The game is set in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and contains many real world locations that the developers painstakingly researched. SOC has an extremely active modding community, I would highly recommend skipping the highly publicised ""Complete"" mod and instead playing with ZRP for your first playthrough. After a first playthrough with ZRP it might be worth trying out the Oblivion Lost or AMK mods, which make quite drastic changes to the gameplay.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I am reviewing the completely vanilla, unmodded version of this game. I have heard there are many great mods, but my first playthrough was without any. This game really was a joy to play. From the awesome world and the terrifying encounters,  to the unintentionally hilarious vodka overdoses and the cheeki breeki-ing, I really ♥♥♥♥ing liked it. The game has been compared to Fallout and other RPG post-apocalyptic survival games, but I like to classify it as it's own type of game. A game where the unknown frightens you and you are left fighting for survival where it seems everything is out to get you. The specifics of what I liked and disliked are recorded in the following paragraphs.THINGS I LIKED:1.First of all, this game has something really special, and equally hard to describe. To put it simply, the world seems to be alive in a way I haven't felt in many other games. Let me paint a picture: You come back to an outpost after a hard day of fighting bizzare mutations and equally bizzare bandits and sit down the fire by a complete stranger playing the guitar. As night falls, you enjoy a diet sausage and a bottle of vodka around the open fire in silence, treasuring these moments of peace. This is what I really love about this game. That is about the only way I can describe it. The feel of the world is Just sublme.2. The core gameplay feels very solid. Guns kill suprisingly quickly and gunfights feel very tense, as if you are actually fighting for your life.3. The story is presented in a unique and fascinating way.  You must learn about your world and what is happening through the PDAs of dead stalkers and dialogue with living ones. The story is subtle and leaves a lot up to speculation, in a way similar to Dark Souls, which I absolutely love.4. Lastly, the game runs like a pro. Kind of a big deal if your computer is utter ♥♥♥♥, like mine. That's what I liked, now here are the things that I kind of disliked (nit-picking ahead)DISLIKES:1. There are a few bugs, which can be expected from a game of this age, although I have read that the majority of them can be fixed with various mods.2. Guns in the beginning are extremely inaccurate. This isn't necissarilly a con, but expect to be missing about 90% of your shots from anywhere over 20 meters until you find something that isn't a Kalashnikov variant.3. The graphics aren't great. I say this, but the dull graphics kind of add to the game's gloomy mood. Again, if they aren't for you, there are a plethora of mods.4. I like to pretend that the multiplayer doesn't exist.CONSENSUS: I love this game. It is one of the most unique experiences that I have been a part of in a while. Whilethere are a few problems, I plan on playing through again with one of the many overhaul mods, which I heard can provied an even better experience. Will definately be checking out Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky.NOTE: Helps if you speak Russian. Not a must, but adds to the immersion and authenticity.			"

												This game is brutal.Holding up exceptionally well almost 10yrs after its release date.Loved this game and the attention to detail is phenominal (especially the Chernobyl nuclear reactor). It does have a lot of bugs, the quests can be frustratingly unexplained and the PDA that you use for map and task actions is horrible to use. But the atmosphere, graphics, sounds and general feel really makes up for this.Not perfect, and definitely not polished, but worth it.			"

												An absolute must-play for anyone into first-person shooters.Despite its notorious amount of bugs (which are easily fixed with well-known mods and community patches for the game), the mechanics of this game and its rather considerable difficulty (at least when compared to other first-person shooters) make it very entertaining to play through. Don't come into this game expecting some masterfully crafted plot or anything of the sort. The story does just its job of giving you a reason to move forward, while also staying out of the way so you can take in everything the Zone has to offer.No game has come close to being as immersive and having such a good atmosphere as the STALKER games.

												Shadow of Chernobyl by itself is a modern masterpiece in terms of fulfilling the requirements of a first person survival shooter. However, when applying Russian mods like Joint Pak 2 the true essence of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R multiverse is captured in a snapshot dating back to 1986 and the first Chernobyl disaster. You will meet dangerous anarchists, mutants, bandits, and more during your stay in the zone. And if you download Joint Pak 2, you will be swarmed with Stashes and new areas to explore from the other two titles, and a vast surplus of weapons, ammunition, explosives, melee weapons, and machine guns. You can even drive old Russian vehicles that give you a steady dose of Radiation! So good hunting Stalker!			"

												Идеи игрового мира S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Тень Чернобыля базируются на повести братьев Стругацких «Пикник на обочине», снятого по её мотивам фильма режиссёра Андрея Тарковского «Сталкер», а также на реальной зоне отчуждения Чернобыльской АЭС[8]. Разработчики рассматривали идею создания игры на основе зоны отчуждения ещё задолго до начала разработки S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Однако мысль о создании продукта, основанного на смешении «Пикника на обочине», сталкерства и зоны отчуждения возникла накануне второго официального анонса игры в марте 2002 года.Изначально концепция данного проекта, имевшего тогда рабочее название «Oblivion Lost», никак не относилась к Чернобылю. Как подтверждают сами разработчики, его сюжет был схож с сюжетом фильма «Звёздные врата». Действие игры должно было происходить в будущем — во время галактических империй, с тысячами населённых планет и разумных рас. По сюжету, путешествие между планетами осуществляется с помощью порталов — недавнего научного открытия. Игрок и его группа являются частью авангарда и играют роль первопроходцев — первыми встречаются с новыми, неизвестными до этого и, возможно, представляющими опасность, мирами. В игре должны были присутствовать постройки ацтеков. Данная идея успела перейти на стадию разработки — сотрудники компании создали играбельный билд «первой» Oblivion Lost.Однако концепция игры, схожая со «Звёздными вратами», показалась разработчикам вторичной. В рамках создания такой игры требовалась проработка множества виртуальных миров, что небольшой фирме было не по силам. Команда поняла, что создание «ультрареалистичного» игрового мира будет для неё более подходящей задачей, нежели создание фантастического. Кроме того, разработчики хотели найти уникальную для игровой индустрии идею, чтобы встать в один ряд с лучшими разработчиками уже после своего первого большого проекта, и понимали, что их текущая идея, повторяющая уже созданные вещи, таким требованиям не соответствует. 29 марта 2002 года они съездили на экскурсию в зону отчуждения. Это явилось последним шагом к решению о полной замене концепции: она стала напрямую относиться к Чернобыльской АЭС и местности вокруг неё.			"

												This is the first game i've sat and researched in 7 years and this is why...Usually when I play games I switch off, hit keys/buttons and just zone out the day, s.t.a.l.k.e.r shadow of chernobyl does the absolute opposite. I have learned in my limited amount of playing that complacency equals death, there is no relaxing, there is no zoning out there is only concentration.The atmosphere of the game, sound engineering, tonality of the setting and the ambience really give off that feeling that you aren't in a playground, you are in a world where one wrong corner and one stray bullet can stop you dead.The best way the developers could get that message across to the player is when you first step out of sids bunker, there's a random series of beeps, the wind blows and sometimes a cat wails in what is probably its last moments. The wind blows emptily through the tree's in the distance you can hear the droning about the zone being a deathtrap and a first time player can feel extremely out of their depth, confused and lost. That feeling of dread and confusion will stick to you throughout the game, that feeling is your survival instincts, a gut feeling you never really understood until now.The first thing many players including myself learn is that you aren't  a walking death machine, you are frail and the zone let's you know that with a swift death, a death you will repeatedly see until the game crushes your precogniscent mindset on how you play shooters. You will reach a point where you will be angry and the game feels too hard and unfair but deep down, you know it was your own error that killed you so many times.Learn the mantra: ""The zone gives with one hand and can take with the other.""Next comes your rebirth, you become cautious of everything, every noise, every voice, bang, scream, growl and even your own footsteps. You learn the cordon like the back of your hand, you study where the dogs go and how the boars attack, you watch the military patrol, you'll probably get brave and after earning enough seeking artifacts you'll bribe the guard to let you through the railway bridge. You memorize every stash you find, you break every box, you loot everything and you drag yourself, heavy footed to the newbie village, down into sids bunker and you unload your winnings.Then, your second lesson begins; you aren't a mule, you cannot carry every gun in the eventuality you will need it, you don't need 30 cans of meat or 50 medkits, you will never need to carry every AK47 you find. Yes I know i've played fallout and yes it kills me to leave stacks of guns on the roadside. But you need to train that out of yourself, if not, you will die and lose it all and it's that crushing choice between leaving a nice heavy suit at the bottom of a ladder or suffer a grim death at the jaws of a pack of dogs that will be your making.Learn the mantra: ""Greed Kills""The third lesson is one that takes time to practice and patience. The zone does not work to your advantage, you are a guest in the zone and everything there is designed to kill, you will become aware that even the air itself can kill you. One thing that terrified me was anomalies, I initially thought after studying the cordon that anomalies were a semi-visible entity that could be easily avoided, how wrong was I when I walked straight into an electro anomaly, and a burner, and vortex anomalies. The third lesson took time and plenty of error to get right, bolts are key in passing through new areas safely pay attention to the beeping you hear that's your only way of knowing they're nearby, that and always staying mindful of the other noises around you.Learn the mantra: ""My ears precede my eyes""The forth lesson in one that you should have been practising since day one in the zone and that's foreplanning; ensuring you have the ample equipment for the job. The landscape of each mission can vary massivley so preplan your travel. Read about the areas online, ask the stalkers about the surrounding areas, learn all you can, because even with that knowledge you can still be taken by suprise.Learn the mantra: ""the enemy of my enemy will also kill me...unless I know they both will already""The fifth and final lesson is discipline, knowing your environs is all well and good but understanding that the previous four lessons are not merely one time tips but a collective of constants is key. Repeating the same processes over and over becomes almost habit the act of stop, look, listen, wait becomes second nature, this is when you begin to fully understand the game you play with the zone. The game isn't to win and kill everything, it isn't even to be the best, it's about being the one who knows when to pick their moments, the right equipment, the right time of day, the right moment to move from building to building.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl isn't your average game, it's a lesson in life in a way, it's a mantra in itself that if you give up, you'll only feel sour about doing so, if you fail repeatedly then the way you're doing it is wrong and most of all if you relax for just one second you could get your face inverted by a bandit with a sawnoff.

This game is literally ground-breaking even compared to the games of today, 2015.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl has some of the best AI that you could ask for, only the players interaction and the pathfinding is scripted. All encounters with the enemy are purely random depending on which side is luckiest or which side the player chose to join or fight.The story is kind of vague but the cutscenes are amazing. There are 7 different endings, 2 depending on choices and 5 depending on stats. The story, though vague, is Really good. The story starts after a second nuclear disaster of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, you wake up in a small village with no memory of what has happened or who you are, except you have been given a task on your PDA to ""Kill Strelok"" or ""Стрелок"" which is Russian for Gunslinger. from there, it's pretty much freeroam with a few main-objectives which leads to a conclusion. The game is as long as you want it to be, depending on which missions you partake in and how much gear you need (or THINK you need) for the next objective.I played this game with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. COMPLETE 2009 mod.All in all, this is a really awesome experience. My rating would be 9/10 (with above mod)The only thing that could make it better, would be a deeper story... Well, not deeper, but better explained. But that's why I'm going to play the prequel now!-For the right ending, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat takes place after Strelok destroys the C-Consciousness.I won't really call this a spoiler, more of a guideline.Chronological Order:1: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl (2007)2: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky (Prequel) (2008)3: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat (Sequel) (2010)			"

												Oh my!This is my first ever review.I havent done a review for my favourite game which is Skyrim but this game is amazing.I was looking for some good survival and horror games and after the metro series(Which were amazing) i wasnt sure if this would satisfy me.GraphicsAs far as graphics goes i dont mind at all.As long as the gameplay or the story are good graphics dont matter that match but it looks good enough.StoryNow on to the story i havent finished the game yet so i dont know where it leads.You basically wake up in a banker and you are told to kill a mysterious guy.GameplayBut enough of that.The 10/10 of this game is the gameplay and the atmoshere.This game is really a great challenge and i am playing on Stalker difficulty(normal)out of the 4 difficulties it has and i have died so many times.I am gonna get this out of the way right now.This game has hands down the BEST ENEMY AI i have ever seen in a video game.The enemies in this game are brutal.They take cover,they prefire(i am not kidding),they coordinate with each other,they cover a person that uses a medkit,they even FLANK you from behind the walls or above.Are you tired of stupid AI that is too basic,boring or run around like idiots?Try this game and find out.You think having a good gear or good aim will let you take a base easily?You are wrong.If you are not careful while walking in the base,you will get either sniped,flanked from a shotgun guy(=dead).You need carefully trace your steps.AtmosphereNow on to the atmosphere the game is less scary on the surface.The anomalies are easy to get used,the dogs are a bit scary if they are in a pack and the bandits are hard at the start but when you get better gear are a walk in the park.The milititary bases like i said above are the challenge.The underground gameplay though is terrifying.If you dont have night vision when you go in you are in for a challenge.The mutants living underground are creepy, and they can kill you pretty fast if you dont spot them quickly.I have seen 5 types of mutants and all were a challenge.Now as far as negatives go the Gunplay while it feels realistic is a bit clunky but thats because some weapons are bad or they are in bad condition.Dont think that aiming at the head will guarantee you a kill.You need to know about zeroing to take some shots.And the other negative are some framedrops at some locations even though i can runs far better games than this.And finally to pump you up a bit i will share with you one of the missions that led me to this review.I had to attack a bandit base so i waited out to get dark because enemies cant spot you that easily unless they spot you with the flashlights.I put a silencer on my TR301(Btw this game has many many weapons)and i killed everyone one by one.Then i entered the underground lab with only 50 bullets.Then i switched to my shotgun to deal with the creepy mutants in the dark.After i stole the the documents,a military hitsquad created an ambush on the surface to kill me,with helicopter lighting the exit so that i couldnt escape in the dark.The best part was the weather.A raging thunderstorm started while i was fighting the military out in the open.I was out of medkits,only had a few bandages left,my character was hungry and tired(out of stamina)and only 50 bullets to finish them.This was one of the coolest and most intense missions i have ever played in a video game.Props to the devs. Cheeki Breeki "

												I spent way more than my listed hours in the STALKER world.I still go back and play this game every so often.  I think this is the best in the series for story, atmosphere etc. The last of the trilogy plays a bit better and looks better. The middle one felt like a bit of a grind.This game is a combination of action and horror survival. Has some replayability with alternate endings and pretty big open maps.This game started an interest in Chernobyl and the events of 1986.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC is a fantastic game, undoubtedly the most atmospheric game I've ever played, the level of immersion is absurd. You play as a Stalker, seeking wealth from the sale of artefacts found in the surrounding area of Chernobyl, however, the ""Zone"" is not a friendly place and danger throughout the game is constant.The gameplay is great, although a little rough at first sight, you need to play at a more measured pace, as I said, the Zone is dangerous, there are many enemies, from bandits and mercenaries, through military and enemy factions of stalkers, plus mutants and environment traps known as anomalies which can kill you instantly. The AI is very good and challenging, which uses efficient combat tactics. There are a wide variety of items, artefacts, weapons and ammunition necessary for progression. The game is graphically outdated but there are mods that greatly improve the look, the setting in the game is a strong point, combined with great sound effects which contribute a lot to the immersion factor, tension is inevitable in some places as enemies camps and underground laboratories.The plot is solid, despite being basically a shooter, there are RPG elements such as multiple endings which depend on your posture during the game, there are factions that you can be friendly, enemy or neutral, depending on your attitudes and choices. The game has a great replay value. One negative point are the side missions, they are shallow and poorly drawn up, become repetitive with time, which discouraged me to continue making them. The base game is known to have some bugs, by recommendations I played with the Complete 2009 mod, which fixes those bugs, improves graphics, AI, sounds, among other things.At the end, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a unique game, I couldn't recommend it more. 9/10			"

												As someone who loves role playing games, FPS games, and post apocalyptic games, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC is a game you must play.I've read a lot of reviews about people's opinions on this game and almost everyone praises it but people disagree on if you should mod it and how you should mod it. Some people say play it without mods before you play it with mods. I think that's ridiculous. I'd say play this game with some sort of mod. No matter how you decide to play this game, ALWAYS play it on the hardest difficulty level. This is how the game is meant to be played no matter what. There are a few mods I can recommend. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Complete 2009 is a decent mod that fixes bugs but it undeniably makes the game a little easier while keeping it almost the same as vanilla. Another mod I love is Autumn Aurora. You can look it up and find the most recent version, but this mod is my favorite. It adds an awesome ENB, better textures and a lot of new weapons. These are just a few things the mod actually does. Another couple popular mods are LURK and STALKERSOUP. I haven't played these but I've heard they're good.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC is one the my favorite games of all time. It's very inexpensive and can grant you hundreds of hours of gameplay with all the mods out there.			"

												An excellent open world survival FPS set in an alternative reality where a second nuclear disaster occurs at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exclusion zone causing strange radioactive anomalies to appear and the wildlife to mutate in to horrific, twisted abominations.The gunfights are tense and require you to make every shot count because the enemies don't stand in the same spot or hide behind boxes like in some FPS' (*cough cough* COD), they will hunt you down and kill you. They're VERY good at hunting you down and killing you.The atmosphere is foreboding and oppressive and there's some genuinely frightening moments which you won't forget for a long time.This is a 10 year old game so the graphics, textures and animations look pretty goofy by today's standards but there are a lot of great mods which are easy to find and install which make the game look pretty stunning.Also be sure to create multiple saves and SAVE OFTEN, LIKE ALL THE FRIGGIN' TIME because this game will not hold your hand and it's very easy to screw yourself over if you don't have enough medical supplies or ammo and it's never fun to get 20 hours in to a game and realise you're going to have to load a save from 5 hours ago.For full immersion put on an Adidas track suit and squat in front of your computer holding a bottle of vodka.

												THE SHORT REVIEW:A cross between both Fallout and Metro, what's not to love about that? Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the best games of it's kind.THE LONG REVIEW:Shadow of Chernobyl has been in my Steam library (and backlog) for quite some time - haven't really had a chance to sit down and play the game, but after longing for something post-apocalyptic until Fallout 4, I'd thought that I would give this game a go. It's safe to say that Shadow of Chernobyl has become an instant favourite, and has immersed me within it's interesting world.The gameplay is fairly simple, if you've played an FPS then you should come to expect the usual, but what makes SoC interesting is it's environments and it's desolate world. Even though I love Fallout, there were some parts that didn't really capture the feeling of lost-hope or desolation, SoC on the other hand nails it completely. It's an interesting blend between world building and exploration that makes me want to know everything about what's going on, there's not really a ""solid"" story so your left to your own devices to investigate (at your own pace of course).SoC has a great way of getting you to become distracted by the strange things, and this curiosity makes the game great to play. The gameplay, however, is slightly hindered by it's save system. It can become a hassle because you have to make sure you have at least more than one saves (or your screwed). Depending on where or when you save can mean life or a quick death, which can be a gamble when it might or might not help you out in the end.Though combat is great, it can often unforgiving as there are moments where you might pelt someone with a load of bullets followed by a swift death. Again, depending on where you saved it might be the difference between having to redo a section or redo an entire quest. Luckily later on in the game you are given access to more formidable weapons making the combat much easier and quicker to complete.There were moments where I was invested into the gameplay, and then there were other moments where I felt like I needed a break from it. It also doesn't help that the game lacks a fast travel system, but it does add to the immersion (which is always a plus in my book). I'm sure with the help of mods there will be a way to fix some of these issues, and I'm most certain I'll be using them on a second playthrough.Shadow of Chernobyl is a first person shooter at heart, but it's a unique one none the less. There are so many survival elements and atmospheric set pieces that draw you into the game. It's not game of the year material, but it's certaintly one of the best survival games out there. Also as a compromise to Fallout's Galaxy News Radio I'd reccomend listening to Apocalypse Please by Muse (or any of their songs). I just happend to be listening to them while playing SoC and something just resonated. Enjoy!MADE FOR: Hardcore fans of the post apocalyptic genreNOT MADE FOR: Players that want an easy survival game (STALKER can be extremely unforgiving at times).STALKER: SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL 8.5/10			"

 S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl	This game is without a doubt a very good production however it is made on the X-Ray engine which in itself is not very good engine. It causes a lot of bugs, glitches and crashes. The game can be modified in various ways by adding graphical improvements and additions increasing the atmosphere of the game. The modifications themselves are very nice but could damage our game and exactly our saves. The graphics are not bad but you can feel the game is already very old. Soundtrack is very good especially when we meet stalkers by the fire when they are playing on guitar. Russian dubbing gives incredible climate for the game. The game offers us two modes for single player and multiplayer. History tells us about a stalker who does forgot what had happened to him and he discovers that in your PDA has a note ""Kill Strielok"".In the game we will visit the large parts of the Zone. We will visit places such as Kordon, laboratories at Jantar filled with mutants and zombies, Pripyat a beautiful and also frightening place and also stunningly nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. The game offers us a wide arsenal of weapons starting with the usual guns ending with Gauss rifle. During an game player is forced to frequent management equipment because it is a not enough to carry everything. I recommend you also certain modifications called  Autumn Aurora 2.1  a really great mod completely changes the look of the game, adds new models of weapons, suits and improved animations. Also adds to the game emissions, new monsters, the ability to sleep and damage to suits and weapons but also their repair. "

												In a nutshell, this game is:10% Luck20% Skill15% Concentrated power of will5% Pleasure50% Painand a 100% reason why to buy this gameAs much as I enjoyed this game, your character kind of walks like a gangbanger from Compton, accuracy is annoying: unloading a whole magazine from a pistol or several shells into an enemy, you'll miss, even if they're in front of you. If you don't have bandages, you're screwed when you are hemorrhaging heavily.This game to me, is like the Russian Fallout (even though Metro is considered the Russian Fallout to some people), I enjoy the layout and the weaponry in this game.Weapons will degrade, ammo has weight, ammunition is scarce for some weapons.Weight is an issue as you will slow down a whole lot if you hold onto several items, forcing you to drop loads of items or drinking a lot of energy drinks to get from Point A to Point B.I would definitely recommend this game if you're looking for a challenge, this game has its horror moments, can be annoying at times but I would recommend it.

												TL:DR;A game that was well ahead of its time, technically and thematically, and has an active modding community and positive reviews to this very day. Highly recommend checking this out, no matter what genre you're a fan of; there really is something here for everyone.FACTS: Released in 2007Inspired ""[by] the popular science fiction novella Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and the 1979 Andrei Tarkovsky film Stalker that was loosely based on it, as well as Stalker, the film's subsequent novelization by the original authors. -Wikipedia, sue meMETACRITIC: 82, 8.4 User ScoreHell, even IGN gave it an 8.2. (and they were whining about the technical limitations of an open-world FPS RPG made by indie developers in 200-and-flipping-7, and how the almost non-existent cutscenes were ""badly compressed"" despite the fact that Half Life proved you don't need cutscenes for a story to be told well.)________________________________________________________________________________OPINIONWhat the hell CANT you say about STALKER? Its critically renowned, a cult classic, STILL has an active modding community almost 9 years later, helped jumpstart the open-world RPG FPS genre mixture, has one of the most haunting and memorable atmospheres I've ever experienced in any form of media (and I'm a fan of horror) AND your crumb-filled, burnt-smelling toaster can run it now!Raving over a personal favorite of mine aside, whatever you don't initially like about this game, you'll come to like. What you won't come to like, you can mod out, or, in (a surprisingly large amount) some cases, in. Some things just can't be fixed however.Yes, it is open world. Yes, there are fences and loading screens between areas.Yes, it has an in-depth story, chock full of lore,personality, dark humor, and some pretty mature themes.Yes, most of it is behind walls of text that instead of reading, you'd rather be AH NUUUU CHEEKI BREEKI-ing the ♥♥♥♥ out of mutants.Yes, there are not a lot of guns.Yes, you can mod more in / mod them to feel better/more realistic.Yes, it can be buggy/glitchy/graphically dated.Yes, the fans have solved all three problems (mostly).Basically, pretty much any problem you have with the game can be solved by either sucking it up (which, in gaming, you shouldn't really be expected to), mod it in/out, or learn to love it.While it certainly has it cons, this is the one game I'm willing to overlook the glaring problems it has in favor of the spectacularly good parts of it.What S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl does wrong, it can be  made right, thanks to an active modding community. What is fundementally wrong with it can be easily brushed aside given the situation of the company and the state of video games as a whole in 2007. What cannot be looked over, modded out, or forgiven, is mostly fixed in the sequels.And what it does right? Oh, it does it so... sooooooo right.			"

												OK, now i previously had a review written for this (and the other ones), but am going to pull a mulligan here.  When i wrote the reviews for the stalker series i based them off the Complete Mod.  Well, now i'm going to do one based off the vanilla experience.  In case anyone reads this VERY soon after publishing this, if you read the other stalker reviews before i've edited them, disregard them because they will be based on the Complete Mod.So, where do i begin?  Oh yeah, the bugs.  For any new gamers playing this game....it's buggy as hell.  Thank God for mods.  This was the last of the 3 stalker games i played on vanilla because i heard so many bad things about the vanilla experience.  Let me just say this.....i REALLY wish i had played the vanilla game first before the mods, because you truly get a glimpse of just how difficult and demanding of focus this game is/demands.  It took me 5 years after release to buy this game because i kept seeing the letters R, P, and G.  Those 3 letters are a turn off to me because when i think of RPGs i think of relentless inventory management, grinding of situations to level up, and MILLIONS of side quests that make for a overlong experience thats full of filler....and more filler.  These 3 games managed to be FPS's with RPG ELEMENTS.  As i've learned while playing many of these types of games....this is what i like.  I like RPG elements.  Just not RPGs.  There is no filler here.  Sure, you have side quests to do, some of which pertain to the story, some don't.  Usually they take a matter of 5-10 minutes, so doing the numerous side quests doesn't feel like a drag.  And as far as the inventory management is concerned, you can only hold 50kg of weight, so you might have to drop something to make room for another.  However, this notion has a little bonus that i personally enjoy.....YOU ARE EXPOSED while accessing your inventory.  Nothing quite like checking to see how much ammo or money you have in the middle of a field when out of nowhere a bloodsucker comes and starts clawing at your face.....love it.Now, on to more pressing matters.  First of all, story.  While i didn't do alot of research regarding the Chernobyl Nuclear meltdown in 1986, i did have knowledge of it happening.  What this game (and franchise for that matter) did, was open my eyes to the destructive wonder the zone has created.  An environment such as this is presented with this haunting, grimm, terrifying beauty.  It's hard stating that because of the real lives lost and the vacancy of a city of 50,000 people, but a real world event presented in a video game has managed to propel me to researching the city of Pripyat and the events of the meltdown.  Never before has a video game world captivated me so much.  Groups of people known as Stalkers travel to the zone for mysterious artifacts that provide a fortune.  Yet, even in a time of destruction humans cant seem to unite, and instead branch off into different factions.  Ever wonder why our world if this way?  Check out the story of Metro Last Light.....you'll see a glimmer of hope.  Anyway, you venture through the zone gearing up to battle other stalkers and mutants to reach the heart of the zone...The Nuclear Power Plant.  Wont spoil anymore.The sound design is some of the best i've ever heard in any game. Never before had i played a game that made me jump out of my seat.  When you're walking through a corridor in an eroded lab with virtually no light and no ammo with a gun thats 10 bullets away from breaking in half, and the only sound you hear is either the growl of a controller or a pipe creaking, you're ready to take 2 steps back.  Such is life in the underground labs.  The artifacts provide an RPG element to the table that is the equivelent to supernatural powers.  They provide you with powers such as protection from anomalies, claw attacks, or added bullet protection.    Last but not least, the gameplay.  Now, my personal tastes of a sandbox game with no filler aside, this game has a decent length time.  A completionist run can be accomplished in about 25-30 hours, which i personally believe is a perfect length.  There is some inventory management, but with the realtime aspect, you wont be spending much time sifting through.  Your guns erode with use, meaning the accuracy is affected with extensive use and they can even jam.  Always make sure you carry a couple guns with you at all times.  Your armor also diminishes after taking some punches, which again, cause the protection to lessen.  As you lose armor, bullets and anomalies will do more damage to you.  Thankfully, with all the artifacts spread across the zone, money isn't an issue, so buying a new armor suit shouldn't be a problem.  But the biggest thing for new players reading this to know is, once you get about 3/4 the way through the game, there's no turning back.  You might not know when that moment is exactly, so be sure you're equipped for ANY situation.  This game is quite difficult, but there's a bit of a difficulty spike in the last 1/4 of the game.  It's one of those games that's oldschool, in the regard that it doesn't hold your hand.  Gamers are spoiled today by having everything spoon fed to them.  This game?  Not al all.  There is basically no tutorial and a steep learning curve.  If you ask me, it works well because it trains you to be on your toes.....and you need to be to finish this beast on the hardest skill level (which is where you should play it).  It's gritty, it's relentless, and it may cause some rage in the many deaths you may have, but somehow manages to be so rewarding at the same time.  Fantastic game, with even more potential if not for annoying bugs and a better optimized engine.  8.8/10			"

												One of the most wonderful Slavic games ever. It definitely was a catalyzer for some other beautiful released (Metro) and up-coming (Escape from Tarkov) games alike.The narrative is somewhat shallow, but the zone and depressive, authentic atmosphere is very immersive, so the zone itself somewhat becomes the most important part of the story.The game offers a huge choice of Eastern Block and NATO weaponry, and big number of items. There are occasional bugs here and there, but nothing that breaks the game. I also recommend playing it with Complete Mod installed. One thing i sorely miss with Complete mod though, are some NPC speeches, such as:- ""Get out of here Stalker. Get out of here Stalker. Get out of here Stalker"" (Duty guard in Bar hangar)- ""What are you, deaf? What are you here?"" (General Voronin in Bar/Duty HQ)- ""Hello-Hello"" (Professor Sakharov in Yantar/Scientist Bunker)- ""I said come in, don't stand there!"" (Greeter/Guard in Bar)			"

Good game. It's got a few kinks in it but, you can get around them. It could have used a better engine imho but, it plays ok as it is. One thing for sure is, you can't just run and gun in this one. The choices you make, determines the outcome of the game and there's no Free-play at the end. In order to complete the game in it's entireity, (finding all the stashes and what-not) you'll have to replay it several times. It has many endings than just one, like most games. 7 endings, to be exact.It's worth the price and the graphics are ok for it's Era. It plays fine for me on W7. There are many mods to add for different types of gameplay as well but, I'd suggest playing it as is before trying out any mods. At least then, you'll know what the game was all about and how it was meant to be.Update: If you really want this game and the others as well, do not purchase them here UNLESS, they're on a super sale or, something. Steam is greedy with games of choice like these so, buy them with a bundle or, where you can get them for a lesser price. All of them are great games but, there's no more updates and or, the like for them anymore.One of the best fps games ever.			"

												I played this game under the recommendation of the semi-famous youtuber ""Life of Boris.""The game follows the Marked One in his quest to find answers to who he is and what his purpose is. You begin in the ""Zone,"" the area around where the Chernobyl Disaster in '86 happened. The disaster led to fantastic artifacts, with supernatural powers, and mutants. People came from far and wide to enter the zone and hunt down these priceless artifacts.You'll find plenty of highly-detailed areas to explore. Entering a place below ground level always gave me the heeby-jeebies.At first you may find this game completely unforgiving on normal mode, but if you stick with it, it gets easier. You WILL find better equipment and become a god. Try to get a scoped automatic, crouch down, and aim for the head. Any 5.56 weapon is good. You'll find plenty of 5.56 ammo on dead bodies. The aiming system is crappy but it is barely tolerable.The Zone has a certain Russian charm. I found it humorous that the bandit gopniks were wearing Adidas and shooting at me while screaming Cheeki Breeki. I found it also humorous that some friendlies were slav squatting in front of a campfire with a guitar, drinking vodka, while ignoring gunfire and mutants that are literally 50 yards away.This game was made with an outstanding amount of effort. I highly recommend it.P.S. This game took me 13 hours to beat. There were some technical issues due to the game's age but I was able to work around it after googling the answers.			"

												The Stalker series is easily some of the most fun I've had playing a video game in recent memory, surpassing even AAA titles. This is the first, Shadow of Chernobyl, and it's a very enjoyable experience.Now that that's out of the way, I'll move on to the important stuff.When you fire up a STALKER game for the first time, one of two things will happen; either it will load without incident, or the game will crash. It's a fact of life; the sun shines, it's currenty 8:00 AM as I write this, and STALKER games like to crash for no particular reason. Disabling the Steam overlay in-game and fiddling with the graphics options, or disabling whatever mods you may have active seems to fix most problems, but sometimes you'll get a bug that, no matter what you do, will not go away. In that case, it's time to hit the Internet and hope that someone has a fix, which, more often than not, they do. When you do get the game to work, start it on a higher difficulty than normal. Sounds stupid, but there's a reason for that. STALKER does a lot of weird things to the guns on lower difficulties, including making a certain amount of shots (both your's and the enemy's) fade completely out of existence before hitting the target. If you're wondering why your gun isn't hitting anything even thought you've got the crosshairs on your scope lined up right on the target's head, that's why. Also, everything on the low difficulties is a bullet sponge. You are too, but only until the end, where the enemies kill you by so much as staring in your general direction. You still die fast on the higher difficulties, but now the enemies will, too. Just remember to save often to prevent crashes from erasing the last hour of progress.If you've gathered one things from that last paragraph, it's probably that the game is pretty hard. It is, although it's also fair. You die after a few hits, but so do most enemies that aren't armored or bigger than you. In addition, every human enemy can be instantly killed by shooting them in the head with any weapon in the game (although you will need armor piercing ammo to do the same for the guys in the late-game). If you can deal with the iron sights and semi-automatic fire rate on your assault rifle, you can get through the game without much issue, although it's still a good idea to invest in better guns and optics; the iron sights on all guns tend to be a little bit hard to find. By that, I mean that the sights are off, and the bullets like to go everywhere. On the starting Makarov handgun, for example, the sights resemble a brick set between two other, differently colored bricks (although, to be fair, this is how Makarov sights look in real life). The bullets also go a little higher than you would expect. The rifles have the same problems, but they can be fixed by grabbing a scope and slapping the two together. And hey, you can take the scope off when it's time to upgrade your equipment, so you're not stuck buying another one!Speaking of equipment, there's weapon degradation in STALKER. The good news is that, unlike the other games, you can sell your stuff no matter how broken it is. The bad news is that there's no way to fix the stuff you like. So, if you found that Desert Eagle chambered for 9x39 rounds, you might want to be careful how you use it, because that gun absolutely wrecks everything and there's only one in the entire game. Oh yes, there's also load times. They're not that bad, but there's a lot of them. Whenever you go into a new area, it takes a few seconds to load, so get used to that.The good news is, that's pretty much the extent of the bad. Now, let's talk about the good.STALKER has managed to blend elements of RPG games and FPS games in a good way. It's still a FPS game, mind you, and it doesn't have experience points or any way of leveling up, but it does have a healthy amount of inventory management. During my playthrough of this game, I spent more time messing about with my guns and ammo than I did in Resident Evil 4. Be warned that bringing up your inventory does not pause the game; you can still move while rearranging things, and enemies can still attack you. If you want to pause, hit the ESC key.The Zone is an excellent setting full of whimsy and terror. I spent just as much time frolicking over hills while drinking enough vodka to give a troubled Soviet general alcohol poisoning as I did crawling through decrepit buildings with my flashlight on, hoping a Bloodsucker wasn't waiting around the next corner, ready to tear my throat out. It really captures what it feels like living in modern-day Russia, except Russia in real life has more mutants than in STALKER.The guns are a bit finicky, but the shooting feels fun and rewarding. The recoil is harsher than in most games, which is all the more reason why you should use semi auto.Disregarding the crashes, the game runs pretty well. I only saw it start to sputter in a few cases, and it actually didn't crash on me that much. I believe I had an issue where it crashed whenever I tried to start a new game, and after that, it crashed two or three more times, but both of those were fixed by just firing the game up again. It wasn't as bad as New Vegas, that's for sure. So, should you buy STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl? That depends. If you're a fan of open-world games like New Vegas, then you will enjoy this game. I highly recommend it. "

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl - old but radioactive!This piece of art is about the nuclear accident in Chernobyl (1986). We write the year 2012 and You have to go into the destroyed environment which is called ""the zone"" to complete your last task - find and kill Strelok. ""The zone"" is dangerous - radioactivity, mutants, mercenary and the army will make your life hard.Stalker is (in my opinion) a mixture of (singleplayer) RPG and (Horror-)Ego-Shooter. You run through destroyed areas, kill bandits, search for ammo or food and find information.The RPG share consists of the possibilty to acquire reputation in the various fractions (freedom, guardians and so on), to do different tasks and receive different equippable weapons, ammo and armor types.positive arguments incoming!++ you can drink vodka++ open world!!!!111++ the KI isn't that stupid++ lively atmosphere++ 7 different endings (5 bad, 2 good)+ no overpowered weapons+ you sh.it your pants in the dark labors...+ the sounds are disturbing and realistic+ the graphics are still handsome (you can patch that)+ nice story (like every ""older"" game)+ the sidequests...are ok...still the same (find that/kill that)+ you will see ""the red forest"", Pripyat, and the NPS (nuclear power station) of Chernobyl...reactor 4the negative aspects are not many, but see:- no fast traveling :(- (no skill or perk system)- you can't repair your equipment- sometimes a bit boring- hard to understand @ the first time-/+ no ""BIG"" actionIn my opinion it is one of the best post-apocalyptical game and perhaps even Metro 2033! The open world makes it much more fantastic (the biggest minus of Metro2033). The accident really happened not to this extent but it happened! The dark basements and labors will plss yourself and this, this is what I want in a Horror-Survival game.

												An open world FPS game with survival horror and RPG elements. The story takes place in the ""Zone"" the area around the nuclear power plant of Chernobyl, where a second disaster has taken place. The place is filled with mutants and diferrent factions  which fight for control of the Zone. The atmosphere of the game is great which helps a lot with the immersion. It's not really scary but it can make you feel uneasy and anxious sometimes. The shooting mechanism is pretty good as is the trading one. You can buy items with money or trade stuff you don't need for them. The graphics are good enough for a game of 2007, but the game is suffering from a lot of bugs. If you inted to play it you should download the Complete Mod which fixes the game's problems and improves the graphics, A.I. and more.90%			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was the very first game of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series I played. The game takes place in an alternate reality, with the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone being the setting. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a 30 square Kilometer area surrounding the Cernobyl Nuclear Power Plant which suffered a catastrophic explosion and subsequent meltdown in the 1980's. This ""Zone"" in the game is home to mutant creatures such as Dogs, Boars, Birds, and Humanoid Creatures, as well as S.T.A.L.K.E.R's who are treasure and artifact hunters, guides, and mercenaries paid to work in and around the Zone. The game takes place over 20 years after the initial disaster, when a second disaster occurs creating pockets of radioactivity and producing anomalies. This is where the main character comes in. You play in First Person as an amnesiac S.T.A.L.K.E.R, nicknamed The Marked One. You are rescued by one of the locals and in exchange you perform tasks and go on missions, while trying to figure out who you are and why you lost your memory. As far as First Person Shooters go, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the more fun ones; However, there are a few bugs. Enemy soldiers respawn way to quickly in some areas, NPC's even Quest NPC's are mortal and will stay dead if killed, making some NPC's difficult to contact or keep alive for long, on the harder difficulty settings. The Game AI is very adaptable, making the NPC's react differently depending on the tactics you choose to use. The environment is also errie, and when played at night, in the dark with headphones really makes you feel immersed in the game. The story is interesting, though told a piece at a time through missions and meeting new contacts. I recommend playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky first since it is technically a prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, though S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl stands strong on it's own even for a 7-year-old game  and is worth the price to play.

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the most atmospheric shooter ever made, and in my opinion, one of the best shooters ever made.The base game can be a real ♥♥♥♥♥ to get working properly, and has many problems, but I wouldn't have 200 hours on this game if it didn't do something right. And bugs can be fixed with mods, and mods is another reason why I have so many hours on this game. The mods released for this game can completely change the experience and make it feel like you're playing the game for the first time again, and mods like ZoA, AMK, and LURK can extend the replayability to ridiculous levels, into the range of multiple thousand hours.If you haven't played this yet, you are missing out on one of the greatest experiences in the shooter genre. Buy it, get the ZRP patches, turn the difficulty to Master, turn off your crosshair, and prepare to be immersed in one of the most interesting game universes out there. SoC has an atmosphere that many games can't manage to capture, not even it's own sequels. I strongly recommend you buy this as soon as possible.			"

												Well now, Stalker, Shadow of Chernobyl. I Tried it twice, in the past, couldn't get past the first bloodsucker, pooped my pants. So after a couple of years, with a pair of grown up balls (:d) I gave it another go, and, boy, am I glad I did. I was pulled right away into the Zone and I just couldn't force myself out of it. I played on stalker difficulty with complete mode 2009, i don't do hard mode on first play troughs. Even so, it was quite challenging at the end, as I entered Chernobyl complete unprepared, with zero med kits in the bag and all the wrong artifacts. That was not a walk in the park. All in all, it took me almost 40 hours with many side quests, and now I think of those 40 hours as some of the best in my 12-13 years of gaming history. The atmosphere is  unique, running trough the post apocaliptic abandoned and creepy Pripiat, followed by a dozen mutated dogs and some other ugly as ♥♥♥♥ monsters while shot by snipers and trapped by anomalies is quite strangely awesome.  I can't recommend this game enough. Get it if you can,  should be affordable by now, I payed 4 dollars for the steam code. Use complete mode 2009 for improved graphics and much more, and enjoy! 10 out of 10 from me.			"

												To this day this game remains the standard I compare adventure and survival games to, especially in the open-world non-linear category. Other reviews will use the term ""ahead of its time"" and in many ways they are right, but the term I wish to emphasize is ""Masterpiece"".I don't know how I came across this game, I think my bestie told me to check it out sometime back in 2006/7; after finally acquiring it, putting a few hours in, I realized that I have been feeling something I hadn't felt since my Freshman year roommate presented me with Fallout 2 back in 2000. (Yes I've played Bethesda's Fallout games, yes they are enjoyable, well-made and recommended, but the bottom line is that I compare FO3/FO4 to Stalker, and Stalker did it better, end of argument).I have played it a total of 7 times since 2007, meticulously finishing all the unique side quests and story-lines, and on a number of occasions, playing one of the overhaul project mods that add tons of content and fix the vanilla issues I remember suffering through playing back in 2007. Yes, I suffered from the stupid decision to release the game before it was completed, but it is so good I went ahead and played it any ways! There were many frustration moments back then, and I learned valuable lessons about Hard Saves and questing management, so if you haven't played the game, I envy you, because you will get to enjoy this Masterpiece after it has ages splendidly.I'll start with the Cons:-You shouldn't play the Vanilla, not when excellent overhaul mod projects exist. The game has been patched by the original development team but there are still some bugs that can be really annoying.-This game will test your limits, both in patience and resilience, mirroring in a way the plight of the protagonist. There will be moments when you jump scared, and others when you jump screaming in rage.-This is an FPS game, so shooting is mostly how you solve your problems. The trick to thinking outside the box is how to circumvent your problem so you won't have to shoot in the first place (or shoot a lot less)! Don't expect much from the dialogue resolution options nor expect high levels of stealth options in missions, but sneaking around can both be useful and rewarding!Pros:-Immersive, beautiful and haunting. It's not a huge world, which allows you to truly bond with each location as many locations will be revisited so many times as you quest and adventure on.-Strong story-line, lore and voice casting. Just the right amount of Sci-Fi-Realism fusion.-A user-friendly interface and control system that doesn't concern itself with console 'peasants' (Sorry Bethesda, but your UI needs serious remodeling, it's the main reason I stopped playing your games)-Great gun action, great thriller moments, heart-pounding narrow-escapes. Gun handling feels authentic, combat is exhilarating.-The game ages like fine wine, with texture mods and 1080p support you won't believe this is an 8 years old game coming from the Ukraine.I'm tired, and hungry, go play the game if you haven't, you'd be a fool not to!

												The vivid imagery and the sheer feeling of a cold, harsh landscape is something this game accurately displays and in great detail. The characters, the setting, the entire story has a very humble, yet intense feel to how you plan your adventure from one zone to the next. The conflict of deciding whether to remain hidden to save yourself or confront the various creatures in order to obtain a much needed quest item is a tough situation, and one I find coming across a lot. It becomes very clear that radiation isn't the only danger here.			"

												Beautiful game, ridiculosly hard, wonderful setting, the sound design is immaculate, the scenes (and this is a fairly poor description) where you are approaching the sarcophogas and the screeen goes sepia colour, intertwined with ghostly synth sounds and eerie voices are some of my favourite gaming moments.  The Soviet aesthetic has been done to perfection.This ranks below HL2, purely because the gaming mechanics of HL2 are more to my taste, but this is up there!			"

												That I've taken so many years to get round to playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R is criminal. It's awesome. Like the kind of game no one should miss out on awesome. I picked it up for a fiver along with Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky. If you're reading this review considering buying the game and you like open world RPG games/shooters/Russians - just go do it. With the 2009 complete mod you're able to enable the likes of HDR lighting etc as well, so the game looks pretty great for coming out almost 10 years ago.Combat is tense and exciting and the weapon and armour varieties are cool. Atmosphere is top notch, I love the sound design, like if it's raining and you hide in a bush the rain is muffled falling on the leaves around you. The game is full of nice little details.Story is ok, but some of the translation into English is a bit rough and lacking in proper grammar :P. Still, it doesn't diminish the game at all, it actually makes it more believable that you're near Chernobyl.Definite 10/10			"

												A dark lab, once inhabited by scientists, it is now the breeding nest for their creations, a city once big and prosperous is now lying silent, only the usual crows can be heard arguing over a dead body of an unfortunate soldier, who's chopper got downed by the Monolith. Nobody in these northern parts, excepting the monolith, mutants and the poor stalker who got too greedy and went into the Red Forest: zombies, no soul, no mind, only instincts and hatred towards everything which lives, not very different from them are the monolith, only that they ''allied themselves'' and praise the ''allmighty monolith'', but, to the south, there is a different life, people talk, laugh, cry, cheer, all of them are in a different factions which tries to reach the north first, so big is the desire, that they got themselves into a so-calles faction war which lasts for an year now, but everybody knows that just 5 people managed to get to the center, Fang- a technician, also a mule of sorts, Ghost- a master of stealth, Doctor- can heal virtually anyone and anything, Guide- knows a path towards anything and last but not least, Strelok- the mastermind behind it all, but he has now dissapeared, and he doesn't know that a misterious stalker is on his tail, apparently he got brainwashed, doesn't remember anything, what happened, who is he? You will have to find out, this game well deserves a 10/10 rating from me.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl is a game that should come with a warning label of sorts. It is a game that has that rough about to explode feeling that some of the more unpolished games tend to give off. The animation is a little off, the difficulty tends to jump all over the place, the text is often complete gibberish thanks to a shoddy Russian to English translation and the game is generally very unoptimized. Yet it's a fun game. Despite all it's flaws Shadow of Chernobyl manages to hit some of the right keys that makes it a great gaming experience.Shadow of Chernobyl is an open-ended first person shooter taking place in and around the highly radioactive Chernobyl area. Now, this isn't the real world birth defect causing radiation, it's the more fun and cherry cartoon radiation that in this world causes mutated monster animals and a variety of spatial anomalies.As you travel the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. you will encounter various factions fighting it out in the ""zone"" as they call it, all with hilariously translated dialog. You do missions, find secrets and fight the wilderness and the people in at as you make your way towards ground zero of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster to discover the truths about what has happened here.Shadow of Chernobyl is a game that should receive a mediocre review anywhere based on it's rather massive technical problems but it somehow manages to overcome it's difficulties thanks to some solid basic gameplay and a strong modding community. A real underdog hit.			"

												I'm late to the show. I first tried STALKER when it came out half a gaming century ago, but my rig sucked. I was pleased to see, that it runs like a charm on my relatively modern machine.First of all: The game is old. Do not expect up to date visuals, do not expect to find a modern UI. Expect to move your hand a lot over the keyboard, because those hotkeys are scattered like they were in the day. Expect to push your mouse over buttons in menus.You should also refrain from expecting a fast paced shooter. STALKER will kick your ♥♥♥. Do not expect to land a head shot with a pistol over long distances. STALKER features some pseudo realistic mechanics, which are not 1:1 real physics but give you a rough feeling about what it means to fire an old worn out gun during a rainy day at a moving target.When I first launched the game and started moving around, I got a little dizzy, because the head bobbing is a little more than I can digest. It's an old but famous game, so naturally I looked for mods. The first hit brought me to a mod package, that tries to fix some bugs and combat annoyances, while trying to retain as much of the vanilla state as possible. Have a look at the ""Zone Reclamation Project"".The difficulty is good. I play on ""Veteran"", the second hardest of four settings. I expected to die a lot, being punished for being careless and exactly that happens. One dog, one soldier, one mutant no problem, but as soon as I rush in and overlook one of them, the surround me and I'm dead.I like how this game can do without pseudo RPG crap. While there is an inventory system and everything has multiple stats, there is no EXP, no skill tree and no character stat farming. Jobs (quests, missions) give you money and equipment and allow you to progress in the story.Let's see if this turns out to be more than run around and shoot bad guys. The scenario is promising.			"

Now dont get me wrong i love skyrim, But im just tired of these little idiot comparing this old ♥♥♥ game to skyrim.I know skyrim came out after Call of Pripyat which really isnt the nicest looking game, Hell none of the stalker games look good compared to skyrim but when you just take skyrim out of the picture and just judge it on its own its a great game for its time.

												Shadow of Chernobyl is a first-person shooter survival horror game . This game is highly rated and untill you sink some hours into it you won't understand why , the accuracy in the guns is the biggest draw back to playing it , which is a pretty big mechanic in a game like this. It has a non linear story with rpg elemets which allows you to roam the map (zone) and take part in random events. It also has a trade system within the game allowing you to upgrade gear etc .I played the first half of this game without any mods and really struggled to find the energy to carry on playing due to bugs and the accuracy of the guns which is very frustrating.The second half of the game i used the ""Complete Stalker 2009"" mod and it made the game 100X better.

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl is an FPS like none other. It combines the best parts of an FPS with the customization of RPGs and the jaw dropping suspense filled atmospheres of a horror game. 1986, the world's worst nuclear disaster occurred at the Chernobyl power station, but in the year 2006 a second explosion occurred causing even more mass destruction and chaos. Now all that there is left is wastelands filled with mutants, strange and bizarre anomalies, and serious amounts of radiation. It is now 2012 and you are awakened from a coma and find this PDA on you and all it says is to kill a man named Strelok. On your quest to find him you must traverse expansive lands and face the most ferocious of foes such as mutants, bandits, various faction members, and the military along with radiation and the many types of deadly anomalies. You have a huge arsenal of weapons, various types of armor and a expansive world to explore for hours. I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is hands down, the best single player game I have played. The atmosphere is fantastic and unlike any other game out there. it was in development for years and even though they didn't manage to include everything they wanted, what they did is still incredible. this is no Console shooter or port, if you want a simple run and gun don't buy it and play for 20 minutes and complain when unlike Crysis you can't kill everything in 10 seconds with your hi tech gun and invincible **** suit.First of all, don't play it without downloading the Complete mod for free first. This updates the textures, sounds, AI, fixes a load of bugs and errors and makes the game what it wanted to be. It doesn't change anything, just cleans it all up.This game isn't like other FPS because it is actually hard. You don't start off with an amazing gun and squad and intel, you have a coat and a pistol and aside from that you are on your own. The Zone is an easy place to die even without having a host of powerful mutants and heavily armed humans roaming around. This game doesn't hold your hand like Western shooters do, or load you up with amazing gear under the guise of being some Spec Ops soldier. The atmosphere is incredible, part's of it are creepy as hell and scary and not like the Doom3 teen equivalent of having a monster jump out when you press the door button or a loud bang etc. It is hard to get into because it is so unforgiving, and the first few maps and missions you are constantly trying to find a decent weapon that doesnt force you to retreat when outnumbered etc. If you want a linear shooter like HL2 or CoD with no freeplay, dialogue or exploration and lots of cutscenes then look elsewhere. There are plenty of games liek that around. if you want a slow hard atmospheric adventure then give it a try, turn out all the lights and play it till the sun comes up; call in sick and keep on playing.10/10			"

												Whew. Learned enough Russian to know ""sucka"" must not be a good name to be called and ""grenatu"" means grenade.+Tense gameplay+Good graphics+Realistic feel to weapons+Story is attaching. For me, at least.+Damn vortexes.-Game has a very slow start. Takes a while before you can sprint nonstop to cut the crap of walking a lot, and get a weapon that shoots in a relatively straight line. Get the Vintar Special Sniper Rifle, by the way. You get used to the bullet drop.-There are some weird bugs around quicksaving and NPC hostility that can get under your skin if they happen in certain conditions that, guess what, happened to me. *sigh* I didn't even want that revolver anyways.=It's not a horror game, though it can get creepy at times. And there's that one time you'll get scared the sh...eet of silk out of you. Just hide behind a wall and shoot it around the corner.=Most non-essential NPCs speak Russian, and only Russian. That means, like me, you'll have to get used to hearing ""sucka,"" ""grenatu"" and that set of words they say when they refuse to talk to you while you don't lower your weapon.=The game's not really attached to decision-making. Don't expect Fallout-ish dialogue moments. Shoot everything that shoots first on sight.8.5/10 A very nice experience.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:SoC is the Dark Souls of the FPS genre. Some will love it, some will hate it. I keep deleting what I'm saying, so I'll just bullet point pros and cons.PROS:-Brilliant setting: Chernobyl has been a place I have wanted to visit for a long time. It is essentially a place on earth that has been frozen in time, and the ability to explore it can be extremely immersive at times. Pripyat in particular offers amazing urban combat, allowing you to snipe from windows in high apartment buildings or taking the fight to the irradiated alleyways of the city.-White-knuckle tension: SoC has the ability to literally keep you on the edge of your seat at times, especially underground areas where light is dim and monsters lurk in the shadows. You will have to memorize enemy movements and behavior to get through certain areas in one piece. Blowouts/emissions will keep you on your toes as well, which are massive releases of radiation that will require you to make your way to shelter as quickly as you can, or die. -Active modding community: The devs of this game made sure to make the game files accessible from a modding perspective. I'm currently playing through using a mod called ""Autumn Aurora"" which improves almost all aspects of the game, and ENB, to make the shadows darker and lighting more contrasted. Many other mods exist that enhance the difficulty, add areas, and create entirely new experiences.-Beautiful visuals: First off, I agree that the game has not aged in the best way, but some aspects of the visuals still look better that some AAA games today, especially the lighting system. Visual mods go a long way in improving the textures, flora and fauna as well. The setting, while bleak and rainy most of the time, will occasionally show off on a sunny day, creating beauty in a dangerous world where death lurks around every corner.-Fantastic gunplay: SoC is unforgiving at times, but in the majority of cases, it will be due to your own error. To counter this, the game offers great shooting mechanics, including ricochets, bullet trajectory, and penetration. A wide (but not too wide) selection of weaponry allows each gun to have a specific feel and personality, which makes choosing which to pick up and which to drop very important.-Challenge and difficulty: PLAY ON MASTER. I cannot stress this enough. Difficulty and overcoming it is what makes the STALKER series so great. It makes victory that much more rewarding. Play smart and carefully, and Master difficulty is beatable on a first playthrough.-Sound: The sound design in SoC is unique and fits the setting like a glove. The beeps of your PDA, the wind rustling in the trees, your geiger counter warning you of nearby radiation, and enemies spewing insults to you in Russian during firefights all add to a wonderful (and terrifying) sense of immersion. CONSStory: The STALKER franchise does not rely on it's narrative to tell the story, which to some, may seem like a terrible mistake. It depends on what you look for in games. I believe that the setting tells it's own story, but you may disagree. I love a good story, but in SoC's case I believe that certain gameplay elements make up for the weak storyline. I should also mention that my game is in Russian, which makes comprehension quite difficult for myself, a native English speaker. Animations: Reload and NPC animations can be a bit strange looking at times. It's entirely possible that the game was created without motion capture due to a lack of resources, which can take you out of the experience at some points. Several mods, however, attempt to improve these faults. A very promising mod called ""Gunslinger"" is being released soon for STALKER: Call of Pripyat, which vastly improves all animations. Worth taking a look.Linearity: While the game does offer quite a large area in total to explore, it can sometimes feel linear. Radiation pockets and anomalies keep you mostly on the roads or in towns, cutting quite a bit of forest out from exploring. However, the forests in the real Chernobyl are some of the most irradiated in the world, so it does make sense. Take that as you will.That's all I can really think of. If you see this game on sale, make sure to grab it while it's cheap. It truly is a wonderful experience overall.9.5/10CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The game that stood the test of time, with a community that's still alive and lurking in every corner of the internet, be it Reddit, ♥♥♥♥♥, or ModDB.A game that is great when played vanilla and modded.The first game in an installment of 3, Pros:+Very Atmospheric+Easily Engrossing+Lots of excellent community made mods (From Texture Mods to full on Overhauls)+A Community that is still alive 9 years onwards+Not very demanding in terms of system requirements, can be played on slower PC's, or even old netbooks. (Graphics can be massively enhanced w/mods)+/-The NPC's are mostly voiced in russian, essential NPC's like the Barman and Sidorovich are voiced in englishCons:-The vanilla version can be buggy at times, and somewhat unstable (Can be quite funny.)-The initial difficulty can feel artificial due to your weak initial loadout/Late game can feel too easy-At easier difficulties, not only can you take more damage, but the enemies can as well (Thus the game is better played on Master difficulty)-No ability to carry on playing after completion in a free roam fashion (Could be remedied by overhauls)-The AI can be a bit stupid			"

												In this game you roam around a bleak landscape and dying horribly either to mutants, bullets, or radiation. And you will die because this game is pretty brutal in its difficulty. It also is filled with NPC's who hate the player character and tell you to go away and will likely shoot at you if you take too long.It's also pretty good. It's post-apocalypse and almost a survival horror game where you have to worry constantly about lurking threats that will most certainly kill you if you are not careful. Also it has a pretty decent story, though one you can easily ignore due to the massive amounts of side-quests there are.In short... it's kinda like a Russian Fallout, though set in Ukraine. It's quite similar to Metro 2033 in its atmosphere, though this game is an FPSRPG rather than just a straight shooter like that game is. This is the first in a series of three games (sadly there won't likely be anymore since the devs are dead), so if this series interests you at all, then this would be the likely starting point.Have fun! :D			"

												(Don't be fooled by the low playtime on my profile. I've been playing this through Steam on Wine, so I've had to do a lot of it in offline mode.)If I told anyone that a game made by Ukrainian indie devs on a completely custom engine was one of the best games I've ever played, they'd look at me funny.Anyone who has played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. would immediately agree.The X-ray engine, while quirky and strange at times, has (reportedly) the most true-to-life shooting model ever. Not that this is any solace when you try to mag dump on a mutant and die to it's melee attacks. The engine also does an amazing job with the general atmosphere of the game. It feels spooky and overbearing, like a good horror game should.When I say this game is scary, I genuinely mean it. Everyone has been in one of those creepy basements with peeling paint, no light, and an awful dusty smell. Now you get to explore those basements with ACTUAL MONSTERS. It does an amazing job of making you panic when you hear heavy breathing.  The mutants, unlike other games which the enemies stop being a threat eventually, remain a continual threat even to the end of the game.The story is great, while a bit ham-fisted, is a great medium for the overall experience.The best news: The game works perfectly in Wine, so Linux/Mac users need not miss out on this fantastic game.

												I got curious to play the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games after watching Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker movie and I have to say that it was pretty funny to see how much different in tone and aesthetic those two adaptations are.Which is actually pretty cool, seeing how you can take a premise and create such different and distinctive experiences in different mediums.In S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl you take the role of a, conveniently so, amnesiac who finds himself on the outskirts of Chernobyl, where for some reason there is a series of supernatural phenomenons occuring  and numerous factions fight against each other in what feels like a post-apocalyptic scenario. The only information you have of your former  self is a target you were in charge of killing, so you go around helping other people in exchange for his location, in an attempt to figure out who you are and what is your purpose.In terms of gameplay and world, one cant help but notice how similar it is to the Fallout 3d games. Most of your time will be spent wandering a very dangerous wasteland being hunted down by bandits, mutated wildlife and the occasional radiation. Safe places are few and far between, with every other single point of interest in your map being for the most part filled with enemies to kill.  Unlike Fallout though, really all you will be doing in this game is killing people and not much else inbetween. The sidequests in this game really arent the most interesting part of the game like the Fallout games, and they boil down to pretty much fetch quests where you are tasked to walk to a specific area, kill someone or something, and backtrack to get your reward. So much so that I ended up not doing them because they simply werent interesting and you also do a big amount of killing in the main quest. The sidequests also have time limits which create a weird sense of urgerncy that doesnt benefit this type of game at all, making you run across a very huge map just to get your reward.  As for said killing, i have to say it's pretty satisfying and fun. You arent superman in this game, which means that enemies can kill you very easily and fast if you arent taking cover and being smart about how you approach them. Every single battle in this game is incredibly tense and demanding and I was shocked by how great the AI is. Enemies will constantly take cover and work together to flank you and surprise you from every corner, and stealth becomes a must to survive to the end in this game.The gunplay is no Counter Strike, but that actually works in the  game's favor because it reinforces your helpnessness and how methodical and cautious you must be in this world. Call of Duty this ain't.The game also contains a survival component, where you must fill your inventory with items like food , health packs, and medicine that cure radiation poison. Personally I found this gameplay aspect shallow, since It always felt like I was simply ticking a checkbox to prevent hunger or bleeding. There was never a point where I desperately needed a rare item to survive.You can however ♥♥♥♥ yourself over if you arent careful with your armor, since the latter areas of the game are filled with radiation that will drop your health really fast making it impossible for you to make progress. My experience with the final quest was incredibly frustrating due to my suit being in poor condition by the end of it and every single spot in the map having high radiation that would deplete my health very fast, while having to deal with enemies at the same time. The strongest aspect of STALKER however, is without a doubt the atmosphere. What a bleak and dreadful place this is. There is nothing more eerie than walking on an empty factory with the wind blowing and the skies filled with grey clouds.There are certain areas of this game that feel straight out of a horror game, especially when the strange phenomenons start to happen.It masterfully eases you into it as you get closer to the Chernobyl nuclear facility.  Trees start to get twisted, the green starts to get brownish, radiation starts to get more dangerous. It really makes you feel awful, in a good way.While the game certainly shows its age and has some flaws, I definitely understand why people adore this franchise, and even if I found the story to be uninteresting and the sidequests dull, you should definitely try it for the combat and atmosphere, those alone make it all worth in my eyes.

A Paladin's Review: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. A World Alive With Potentially Horrifying Situations.Genre: FPS RPG Post-Apocalyptic Horror Open World.Developed and Published by: GSC Game WorldPlatform: Windows Only. Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]PreambleThere are games that leave an impression for a lifetime and this is one of them. How else could I forget such a unique title as this? The world you explore and survive in feels alive unlike any other open-world game I've played to date or since. This is a game that has sent me through a whole range of emotions from fear to exultation at having succeeded at survived in the dark depths of the Labs....those labs...*shudder*. Good adventures always end bittersweet. It was constant anxiety with this one. I was never quite certain what was around the next corner. Always wondering if I would run into a pack of mutants ready to rip my face off or other more murderous STALKERs. This will be a spoiler-free review of the game and I'll do my best to cover what I can. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl originally took over seven months for me to complete. Granted, I took a few breaks from the game which is why it took so long. According to Steam, I've logged over 41 hours with the game. Feels like the longest 41 hours of my life. The game made me as jumpy as a rabbit when playing it and some of the things in the game elicit such a fearful response that it made it difficult to play it. Is that silly? Maybe, but that's the fun of it as well. Even so, I still faced my fears down and finished the game. Only to begin jumping right into the sequel afterwards. I am a sucker for punishment.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsShadow of Chernobyl is such a unique game that it's hard to quantify all of what makes it so. When I had played this, I hadn't really been exposed to much of the horror genre and it's still not one of my favorite genres, except for psychological horror. Which I can only think it's because I want to overcome my fears. What better way to do it than in a world full of radiation, mutants and horrifying creatures. SoC is an FPS and RPG hybrid with lots of open world elements. There's a main quest to complete, lots of optional side missions that you're free to tackle and plenty of weapons to choose from. The big selling point for SoC (outside of its post-apocalyptic themes) is the A-Life engine. The A-Life engine allows creatures and NPCs to roam the wasteland with a set of guidelines and rules. They eat, sleep, move around, shoot enemies, talk to friends and generally act like human beings. In combat they avoid hazards, throw grenades and act tactically, sometimes sneaking up on you when you don't realize they're there. It isn't uncommon to see a skirmish between an important NPC and his vanguard against a random bunch of mutated dogs that were at one point on the other side of the field they were in. This world is unscripted which means that sometimes events such as a quest giver being attacked and killed can happen. And then you're completely unable to finish your quest. That's not intended to happen, but A-Life allows for it. Oblivion Lost Mod & The Modding CommunityMy first run through of Shadow of Chernobyl was with the Oblivion Lost mod. You'll want to run this game with at least one mod to fix a lot of the issues the original game has. Due to a rushed development timetable, a lot of content and original ideas had been cut from the game. But, the modding community took it upon themselves to fix up the numerous issues and open the game up to the developer's original vision. One of the more popular mods is Oblivion Lost, which was recommended by Moonshinefox as the most optimal and true experience of SoC. You can find a full list of changes at this link[forums.filefront.com]. Suffice it to say, it makes the game shine. As an overview, the mod adds Emission events which happen at random times. If you're standing outside, they can kill you with a big old dose of radiation. Worse, it causes the anomalies to move around in the world, kills off NPCs that are also outside (potentially screwing up your quest) and also causes an increase in the number of mutated creatures. Yay. Oh and what are anomalies? They are areas where the laws of nature and physics have been corrupted and are dangerous/lethal to passing entities. There are anomalies of fire, electricity and so on. The mod also adds factions that interact/shoot at each other, weapons, random weather, artifact transmutations, better realism, and a lot of other things. PC Settings & ModdingSettings are fairly reasonable and include most of what you need. However, some settings don't work such as the AA slider, it doesn't actually do anything and V-sync is completely broken. Fixing these problems will require installing a mod. You can check out the issues and modding solutions on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. As for what settings do work, there's a reasonable selection of resolution options, gamma, contrast and brightness sliders. Advanced video options include vision distance, objects detail, grass density, textures detail, lighting, shadow quality and anisotropic filtering sliders. They don't give you any numbers to understand what you're changing though. Key rebinding and alternative keys are also available in the game. The only audio sliders are SFX and music though the game supports up to 7.0 surround sound. Final ThoughtsThis isn't a perfect game by any stretch. It has a lot of bugs and quirks that have been tackled by the modding community but it can still lead to some unfortunate situations while you're playing. Including but not limited to: being stuck in a level with no ammo and unable to move forward, wonky combat balance and NPCs behaving erratically. However, I think the Shadow of Chernobyl experience is worth the risk. It's steeped in atmosphere, the game engine makes the world feel truly alive even if it's heavily scripted and the richness of this Russian post-apocalyptic world is utterly unique. Sometimes the best games are the ones that are the messiest. It's a pity that there hasn't been any continuations in this genre but I hold out hope someday, someone will give it a go.

												Simplest way to put it. If you love the Fallout and Metro series and want both games come together. This will be their love child.You will lose yourself in hours and hours of gameplay. I highly recommend reading up on the controls or watching LP's first before getting this as it is in a sense 'hard' i am not going to tell you how 'hard' it is. But trust me when i tell you, it's better to be safe than sorry.Lastly there are two highly recommend mods that goes with this game. one is ""complete"" and the other is ""lost alpha"" you can play the game, or if you feel nostalgic you can play the game by itself in it's original condition of course. (You can only have ONE mod by the way)The only tiny concern is make sure your PC specs are capable of performing well with this game. You might have to run it on 'low' settings to prevent the typical lags, crashes, and freezes within the game.""Complete"" is an overhaul plain and simple. Just bewarn if your PC begins to lag and freeze alot. the easiest solution is to run the game on 'low' graphical settings. ""Lost Alpha"" it is a standalone modification based upon the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. It will offer old features seen within the game series, While offering never before scene features within the game that in the modders opinion is a 'must needed'. I highly recommend this game for the post-apocalyptic gamer. Plain and simple			"

												THIS GAME IS GREAT!!Once upon a time, Doom and Fallout had a baby, and then gave it steroids. A lot of it. And thus, STALKER was born.STALKER is an amazing series, with three games in the series, I have several days on this game, but Steam doesn't show it because I was offline while I played it. (Since I had no internet access at the time.)With a huge map to explore, plenty of monsters to face, a large assortment of weapons, armor, and missions to do, this makes for a fun time.STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is an open world FPS game. Taking place in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Did you read that?!  THE FREAKIN' Chernobyl Exclusion Zone!  I even bolded it, just to show how awesome that is. The game is not creepy in a sense, but if you are prone to being frightened easily, a few areas of the game may give you a slight scare. Pros: Bro, this game takes place in Chernobyl, that's awesome in itself!A huge map to explore.Plenty of missions to do.I large assortment of weapons and armor.Treasure hunting!Immense variety of enemies.Different atmospheres and moods of tone.A few scary and eerie places in the map.A nice story. (Could use improvement.)Challenging gameplay.Good graphics.Moddable.But, of course, like all games, STALKER has some downsides we can't dismiss:The game is highly buggy and glitchy. I had a big problem getting the game to work, and I still don't have it working fully. LONG LOAD TIMES:  The load times are atrocious, and without doing some tweaking work, it will typically last from 10-15 minutes. Although settings can be changed, and mods can be installed to help this issue, it's still a problem. While the game loads, go take a shower, clean the house, or mow the lawn, it needs to be done anyways.If you don't mind bugs and glitches, sit down, grab yourself some Cossack's Vodka, put on your Russian hat,  bring a bear into your house  buckle up, and enjoy the awesome ride this game has to offer!PS: Don't actually bring a bear into your house.

												This game is like a Hotline Miami, you hate all the enemies and how much youll die but its so much fun at the same time.Came to a camp with a single guy playing the guitar, left. Came back to the same camp and the guy was dead.Came back to the same camp later on and two more guys were there, left. came back for the fourth time, one of them were dead. No enemies for miles. Pripyat/10This game isnt like fallout where it tells you what you need and where you need to get it. You need to read up on some of the mechanics and make sure whatever you have on you is enough to get you through the next zone, or you'll land flat on your ♥♥♥ and find yourself loading a quicksave... again. The AI is abnormally stupid and will often hit you flawlessly whereas you could use the same exact gun and youd be lucky to hit the broad side of a barn. The enemies are repetitive and seems like you're just in a mod for half life with a rusty reskin. The atmosphere is amazing though. There are many times where the task would be to go underground and I'd be frustrated because of the closed spaces and Snorks (sp00ky mutants with gas masks) could be waiting for you to..... spin around in endless circles. The AI is unbalanced aswell. During a side quest where you can help a faction called the Duty, where you have to raid a military and I ended up taking on the base by myself and not even getting the reward for the task because my commanding officer was dead.Pros:-Atmosphere-Vodka-Sausage-Guns-Story????Cons:-Unbalanced AI-No quick radiation button-Inaccurate guns-No fast travel-Repetitive enemies-Wonky AI (Will often run in circles)Overall:восемь из десяти (8/10)Conclusion:This game is blatantly broken in some aspects, pop ins, OP enemies. But this game can do one thing that Fallout couldnt do in a post apocalyptic franchise, Scare me. Make me feel the cold in Russia. I personally couldnt finish this game due to not having the right armor but i was literally 5 feet away from the ending cutscene so watching the ending on YT was good enough. You will rage at this game, but its all in good fun.			"

												Stalker starts out a little boring and unforgivingly difficult (pistols suck), but after the first hour or so it gets better and around the 3-4 hour mark it gets amazing, you will see what I mean. If you are looking for an open world FPS, that has good story, gameplay and a 'do what you want' attitude, then you must get Stalker. It reminds me of Fallout 3, it resembles the same freedom you have in Fallout (kinda), and Stalker is definetly on par with Fallout 3. Great game, but does take PATIENCE.			"

												First of all, this game has serious issues. Upon starting a new game, all that appeared was a blank box that took up 1/4 of my screen, with desktop in the background. Only, the game itself occupied that desktop space (while crashing), so I could not close it without restarting Comp. It happened again and again and after hours of research, I finally found the right ini settings that I had to delete and tweak just to first play the game. It played well for a while after that, and then went back to doing the same thing. Now I am stuck with it and changing the resolution doesnt work. The only way I can play this game now, is in windowed mode. The game itself though is wonderful. I tried the Fallout series for the first time and was greatly dissapointed. It was bland, and the setting was god awful for a post-apocalyptic theme. The lore was impossible to remember and it had severe lack of player motivation. But then I tried S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and my thirst was quentched. Despite not being able to create a character and name them, the game still gives a great FarCry-esque roleplaying experience, in an open world covered in radiated forests and territories ruled by diverse factions. The game world is very limiting in terms of exploration, but that is easily changed with the use of mods. Exploring the Russio-Ukrainian lands it sets you in offers an immersive and unique experience, and keeps you interacting with the people and the environment. The Skyrim and FarCry-like feeling of delving deep into dangerous territory, getting into a firefight with a group of bandits or monsters to save a friend, knowing that you can walk away and explore at any time. It lets you know that YOU are still in control, and grants a great amount of freedom with this. The graphics are amazing for a 2007 game, and its age allows beautiful FPS and a variety of PC's to handle it. If you like exploring the grey and rainy forest in an open, diverse, post-apocalyptic world, this game is for you. Be prepared for launch issues though, which do set the game back a lot.			"

												If you're used to something like CoD or any easy game this will eat you up and spit you out, it's hard and unforgiving but at the same time amazing and the best atmosphere you can get in a game. I really recommend the LURK mod http://www.moddb.com/mods/lurk and shaders max http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-shaders-max , for LURK you just put everything in the STALKER folder and for shaders max you need to go to gamedata/shaders, delete everything and put the stuff from the mod's shaders folder, you should also tweak ShaderSettings.txt in the shaders/r2 folder if your PC can/can't handle it properly, of course both mods have a readme file.

There is alot of stuff explained here, Before you get into the action, So don't worry.The game takes the atmosphere after the Chernobyl accident in 1986. If you like weapons, Survival, Chernobyl, This game is perfect for you. If you completed the game, And It didn't satisfy you enough, You can try installing mods into the game.

												Great like all Stalker series games... FPS with awesome rpg elements and a scary aura always uphowever, i must say that, unlike call of pripyat (the last game of the series so far) this 1 has a few dull momments due to the size of the map and the constant running up and down... plus unlike pripyat, this game offers little in terms of surprises along the way (towards quests). Its an awesome game and i definetly recommend to stalker fans or intense fallout game fans... however, i must say that, if you havent played the last of the series (call of pripyat) pick it up first, since you dont need this game to understand the story and will get a better gameplay than this 1.

												The whole STALKER series is just amazing, but Shadow of Chernobyl perticularly is fantastic, and in my opinion the best of the series. It's an incredibly fun and immersive shooter, which feels very satisfying and rewarding after doing just about anything in the game. I would recomend it to anyone who likes any sort of challenge, or just a very good story. I also recomend, after playing through it once, to get a mod called Oblivion lost, which will add a great deal of more content to the game.			"

												STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is a game based entirely on the gameplay provided, as well as it's difficulty that stems from it's mechanics, and the hazards laid throughout the zone. The design, be it in the environment seemingly crafted from real-life examples to great detail, or the monsters themselves, as well as the great balance of guns and their somewhat realistic portraits conveyed through the game, is simply undeniably good, throughout balance with fights and environmental situations that can't fail but to make me a bit paranoid and scared.The game, itself, falls short with it's story, however. The backstory behind the main character is explained well as time goes on, but the story itself is nothing but fetch quests and favors where you are rebounded across the entire country just to find out whom Strelok is, whenever the most people have given you is nothing short of, ""Oh, I know this other guy who might know him."" There is not much motivation to do it after that, and overall, it starts to become tedious within the first few hours of the game as you start to realize that the quests seem silly, as they're nothing but jumbled messes of situations haphazardly thrown together because you're trying to find a man, and even then, that logic goes straight out the window sometimes, so you're left with, ""Just do it, because hey, you want to do it!"" It is a good mechanic for a free-roaming STALKER game, but not for a man with such an objective in mind, which doesn't even matter until it is pulled up again later on in the game.Anomalies in this game aren't exactly clever, save for a few. The majority of them are simply you getting harmed and then having to use a med kit, which is not much variety between the two, save for that one just stands there, and one pulls you in. The anomalies that go well beyond this, like making you go straight to bleeding badly as soon as you step in them, are good, for they experiment with what they can do, but overall, they just seem a lot like random environmental hazards, which don't really change positions at all.The gunplay is favorable, and, in the right setting, STALKER has monsters and situations that just plain get to you, that really make you shiver in fear. There are flaws in the game, such as stashes being completely devoid of anything until you get the information of the stash itself, but overall, the experience that it makes you go through, as well as the balanced difficulty and unsettling environments, as long as they last before they get bombarded by human enemies out of nowhere, truly make the game what it is.Do I hate this game? Not at all. Despite what I have stated, I could play STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl lots and lots, and still find out new things, which recreates that magical spark that made me love the game whenever I first started playing it.The gameplay is done to such a degree that it actually goes with the very theme of STALKER itself, which completely makes it all the more meaningful once you do discover what it is.What is it, you ask?Well, that's an answer that you'll have to find for yourself. The Zone is full of mysteries, but let it be known that you are like everyone else, improving and trying to live just a little better. Maybe, through the situations you find yourself in, you'll find out what it all teaches us sooner or later.Good hunting, Stalker. I'll be drinking in your honour.			"

												I enjoy Deus Ex and System Shock 2 as much as the next person, but for me S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernoybl towers over the first-person shooter genre.It's that chilling feeling gotten by wondering across the bleak open landscape while hearing dogs howling in the distance (this being one of the very few games to be able to pull off outdoor daylight horror), It's that weird moment when you see some invisible monster for the first time and realise the game's surreal underbelly. It's the beautiful atmosphere created by the lightning. It's the tension built by running around trying to find that one last bit of radiation protection before you die of radiation poisoning. It's that feeling of satisfaction when you finally manage to fight your way through a group of clever AI enemies, or the stress built by panickingly trying to drink enough energy drink to simply run through them. Or, more broadly - it's the perfect mixture of challenging difficulty, fantastic atmosphere and great survival mechanics which make it so special.The game builds itself on creating tension through its inventory management system and creates such perfect results through it. Funnily enough, early in the game I found it annoying that managing your inventory doesn't pause the game and sometimes I stopped dead in the middle of combat because I was too heavy to move, but by the end I realised that was such an incredible way of building tension. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is, after all, a game of scavenging and half the fun of the game is about deciding whether you can afford to go over to pillage a befallen enemy, work out what you need to take and if it's not too heavy to carry without getting killed.But great survival mechanics and a really well balanced difficulty don't make a game on its own and the other main thing which really makes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. stand out is its gameworld. It's such a beautiful, desolate overworld and as much enjoyment as the challenge was just running over the baron plains with dogs howling and boars roaming around with some odd shots in the background. Even, the main homehub of Rostock has this incredibly eerie and desolate feel about it.There's just this exquisite balance of challenge and ambience which make this the perfect FPS. Played alone, at night with headphones it is quite the experience.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is probably my favorite game of all times.The ambience, the atmosphere, the exploration, I am almost afraid to reinstall it because I know I'll just get lost in the Zone all over again.This game has inspired me many times in many endeavors, it is my favorite First Person Shooter, and one of my favorite Single Player games.

												The only game of this trilogy, this franchise that I am happy to recommend to everybody out there who like post-apocalyptic FPS games. While post-apocalyptic reminds many of us of Fallout 3, Stalker's surroundings are different and instead of the barren lands full of debris you have to imagine a nuclear wasteland. This wasteland is called the Zone and interestingly, the game follows the catastrophe of Chernobyl by adding a twist to the story: here the activities in the power plant did not stop after the incident, in fact, quite the opposite happened which was eventually followed by another explosion. Now, this huge radioactive area is fully of anomalies and mutants and of course stalkers, mercenaries who are obsessed with all this and aim to find all kinds of artifacts that are the results of the catastrophe.While the game was released back in 2007 it should be noted that a mod called COMPLETE is available to enhance everything in the game: it ups the visuals, lowers the amount of bugs and glitches and even adds new features to make the gameplay easier and more exciting. The game offers a free-roaming system: missions can be triggered after speaking with various individuals, other than that you are free to go wherever you want and whenever you want. There are many side missions, too, that lengthen an already long story and as the game offers at least half a dozen endings in the form of rendered cutscenes you have a high replayability value here. One of the downsides for me was that I was not exactly notified that once I start a particular mission there will be no return. With the COMPLETE mod this is now corrected as after completing the story the game puts you back in the Zone and you are free to complete any pending missions you had. Another thing was the difficulty - I have played a lot of FPS games and these I usually complete on hard difficulty settings, too, so I consider myself a veteran but even Stalker was too difficult at times. I believe it is an AI issue as enemies can easily give you headshots from a far distance and there's no room for suprises attacks, either. They are just too good so quick-saving is recommended frequently.Stalker is a classic. It may not be a beautiful game but its gameplay is certainly entertaining and unique. With the COMPLETE mod in place it is an even better experience.			"

 S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chernobyl This game is a masterpiece. The atmosphere is amazing, the gameplay is good and it has good replayability. I first bought all S.T.A.L.K.E.R. just to experience Chernobyl. After that I was just hooked. I love the setting, the anomalies, mutants, bandits, it just has that feel. The game is a bit buggy from time, like AI being kind of stupid and quests glitching. But the pros far outweigh the cons, at least for me. If you want a game that sucks you in the story and setting then this is a very good candidate.Fegelein approves.			"

												STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is a difficult game to start, but rewarding to finish. I enjoyed this game more and more as I played; loved it by the end. Fantastic atmosphere.The game is very grim and challenging. It plays mostly like an RPG, because you're taking on missions and learning a story as you go. But there are no levels, no experience points, and no skill tree, so in that regard it's somewhat like an FPS. It's also scary, and resources are scarce, so it bears elements of the survival horror genre, too.The ending is satisfying. Unlike many RPGs that cop out with a boss battle, STALKER gives you answers and a conclusion that makes sense.A few tips if you play. 1) Find and use the ""STALKER Complete"" mod. It improves the graphics and the English translation, and fixes bugs. 2) It's OK to play on Novice -- you'll die plenty on any setting. 3) Use a game guide. It will help you with the weapons, and keep your story on track. I liked IGN's guide. "

												Get out of here stalker! Just kidding, here.. have drink, let's have a little chat.. This game has a truly immersive yet horror like atmosphere, the likes I've never experienced other than DayZ I would think. It includes a nice RPG system for a fallout like world that makes it easy to see what you have equipped and what goodies you have in your inventory. I really enjoy the anomalies, those things that kind of do stuff to you if you get too close. I really need to mention to pick up an anti rad artifact before doing the last mission because I kind of got stuck with droping to the ground every time I would load...			"

Note: For these first 1 or 2 paragraphs, it will be a copy/pasted response explaining my lack of game time on Steam. This will be pasted to my other reviews for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, only changing the games listed here. Starting from the 3rd paragraph and onwards, it will be the actual review.I originally bought the ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Collection"" bundle for about $7.50 on Gamersgate, and back then they only gave me the DRM free(ish) versions of the game. On October 27th 2014, I was going to re-download the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Series, as I had uninstalled it when I went on a massive uninstall spree. Only this time I noticed that GamersGate gave me Steam Keys for the entire collection! So my ""XXX hrs on record"" will be misleading, as I play a lot of S.T.A.L.K.E.R..Now to the actual review. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is my favorite S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. I love the entire series, which is set in Ukraine, around the Chernobyl area a few years after the incident with the power plant. I even like Clear Sky, but Shadow of Chernobyl will always be my favorite. You start out in Cordon, an area located inside what's called ""The Zone"",  talking to Sidorovich. The reason you're talking to him is because near the wreckage of a crashed truck, with only amnesia and a PDA saying ""Kill Strelok"" to your name. You, known only as the Marked One at this point, ask Sidorovich for help in locating this Strelok, hoping that doing so will help you remember who you are. However, in return, you will need to do a few things for him, though he compensates you in return with information and some sort of good in most cases.However, once you get that first mission from Sidorovich, you're free to do whatever you wish. You can completely ignore his task and go forth to explore the Zone. Granted, there will be a few areas you can't reach without doing the Main Missions, but a good portion of the game is available to you right off the bat.Outside of the main quest line, which is fun and interesting, there are side quests you can find. Now, you won't find as many side quests as you would find in a quality RPG, but there's still a decent amount to find. But other than that, the Zone is a large world for you to explore, finding hidden stashes containing powerful artifacts which give passive boosts, and unique weapons. Hunting mutants and humans alike if you wish. Also, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has a very active mod community. Not as large as some other AAA titles communities, but still very active.Personally, I think this game is a bit dated in the graphics department, and there are some annoying mechanics, like the fast weapon durability loss. I like to use the COMPLETE 2009 Mod, which greatly enhances the graphics and balances the game quite a bit, but still preserves the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience nearly perfectly. I say 'nearly' because the Complete mod is the center of many heated neckbeard arguments. The ""veterans"", which are just a very loud group of people both old and new to the series, claim it makes the game way too easy, and the opposite side arguing the opposite. I've seen this fight so many times with morons on both sides of the argument. The Complete mod DOES give a bit more health to just about everything, but it's not the ultra-mega game changer some make it out to be. It certainly brings the highest difficulty down from ""Masochistic"" to ""Very Difficult"", so if you want a Masochistic time, play without the mod. I'd only recommend the mod for Shadow of Chernobyl though. The Clear Sky version isn't very good and absolutely AVOID COMPLETE FOR CALL OF PRIPYAT. The Call of Pripyat version, other than doing little for graphics, puts a save corrupting bug near the end of the game, I'll provide a link to the Complete 2009 ModDB page at the end of this review.Which is pretty much now really. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is an open world FPS game with an incredible atmosphere and amazing gameplay. I recommend it to everyone who likes FPS games in the slightest.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Complete 2009(2012). It has (2012) on the end because it had a rehaul in 2012. For the Downloads area, look under the title, or above the pretty picture that has ""STALKER COMPLETE 2012"" on it. Please follow the instructions included with the installer/zip.Afterwards, if you want to play with more mods, or would like to intact with a  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. community that doesn't have the toxicity of the Steam Forums, head on over to the  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Subreddit on Reddit.com! Clicky clicky.Edit 1: Changed ""set in Russia"" to ""set in Ukraine"" after jeeves_bond clarified my mistake. Also, I state that Call of Pripyat COMPLETE introduces a save corrupting bug. That's a small part of it. To be specific, the main issue is that, when it hits, which has a high chance, the bug makes it impossible to move between the last area of the game and the other 2. The only real fix is to load a save from before the final, an second to final area. That's where the save corrupting comes in, as it will sometimes corrupt the saves too.			"

												STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl is my favorite game of all time. There's no way to properly express how fantastic it is. But I'll try I suppose.The game takes place in Chernobyl, as the title suggests, though this Chernobyl is a much more mysterious one. After scientists went and messed around in Chernobyl after the disaster, weird crap started happening. Blowouts, anomalies, artifacts, and nasty warped mutants craving human flesh. The game is a mix between the real life place Chernobyl, obviously, mixed in with world and plot elements from the novel Roadside Picnic (which is my favorite book ever) and the film based on the book, Stalker (which is a great film too). I will never know why they picked that book, Chernobyl, and mutants in one game but one can only think it must've been some divine force that made it happen. The game is a lot like a realistic, Slavic, and overall more terrifying version of Fallout. Not saying that Fallout is bad though.Gameplay is top-notch, the shooting is pretty great and going and finding artifacts can be really tricky. Depending on your alliances, you'll go up against either bandits, different factions, loners, or everyone. The fights are intense and may require many reloads before you figure out how to stump your enemies. This is not an easy game at all, even on the easier difficulties. It's hard as balls and will mess you up hard, you can't go without quicksaving. I'm not good at videogames, so it was a struggle to finish this one, but it was worth it.I can't go talking about a game without talking about it's faults though, no matter how much I adore it. The AI is weird in this one.... it goes from Vash the Stampede level of accuracy to the level of skill you'd expect from a drunk man. The graphics aren't exactly triple-A material either but the atmosphere and the overall visual design makes up for it. STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is an interesting and unique title; there really isn't anything like it. It has its bugs and technical isssues, yes, but that won't stop me from loving truly awesome, scary, intense game. In the words of Number 6™, ""There's nothing quite like Russian post-apocalyptic fiction, comrade!""EDIT: I made a video review if you want to check it out.

												Hundreds of hours invested in this on the disc version purchased many moons ago. STALKER is a bleak, nightmareish vision brought to life even more so with the huge collection of community made mods available. This was the first game in the trilogy of games the other two being Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky (a prequal). Both of which are also incredible, CoP more so.When you leave the Cordon for the first time after speaking to Wolf, walking up that path towards the road, turning and seeing your brothers slowly disappear into the distance, hearing the wind howl around the barrel of your creaky old shotgun, suddenly hearing some sort of demonic cry far away to the east and a chill creeps down your back. The sun is low in the musty sky - but just up ahead there is an old abandoned mill to explore, just make use of the fading light.For me this game creates an atmosphere I've never felt before (or since, other STALKER titles not including) of a world gone to hell - the Zone, a huge area of land around the defunct Chernobyl reactor, now infested with nightmareish creatures deformed by radiation, different collections of (human) mostly factions wanting to kill you on sight and rob your last tin of tuna. Secret underground labs where horrific experiments happened before everything went to hell. Deserted farm buildings where blood hungry things lurk in the dark. STALKER is all about tension and fear, but also survival.There are mods you can get that improve just about every aspect of the original game, textures, weapons, music, audio, bugs ironed out, even previously unnavailble areas.I love STALKER, it's tremendously satisfying to survive in the Zone, it's terrifying, compelling and full of detail (if you also read all of lore/diary entries that Marked One enters into your PDA throughout the game.For anybody that likes FPS/open world survival shooters with strong RPG elements, for anybody that loves to become really immersed in their chosen universe, there is nothing quite like STALKER.Just don't forget your anti rads, and take care of Nimble - he's worth it.

												The S.T.A.L.K.E.R series of games is my favorite series of games; Let me preface this review with that statement.Do you like Atmosphere?Do you like a challenging, rewarding experience?Do you like the feeling of helplessness, that edge of adrenaline as something that can snap you like a twig without lifting a finger?If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then this will be a very rewarding game in every aspect of the way. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, specifically, Shadow of Chernobyl, is iconic for it's atmosphere so thick it drips out of your screen. The distant sounds of assault rifle fire as you clutch your rusty Kalishnikov to your chest are always terrifying. Is it bandits? Is it a local militia trying to fight off some horrible mutant? You'll always feel vulnerable in the wide, gray fields that make up much of S.T.A.L.K.E.R's landscapes. But don't think running for cover inside will make you safer.. Buildings can be home to traps set by enemies, a bandit camp, or a vicious Bloodsucker's lair. The game mechanics are solid, if abit stiff. You'll never feel cheated if you die; This game is much alike Dark Souls in that regard. However, if you play on any difficulty above Stalker, expect frequent deaths; I reccomend Master, but that's just me. Fortunately, the game features a fairly primitive, if not effective quicksave/load system. Many weapons feel powerful and give feedback; The thunder as you unload a clip from the shiny gun you found on a corpse will always light up the darkness and make you feel alittle less vunerable. Don't take it as a sign of invincibility - Often, you'll be found a few bullets short, gun empty and useless as something with razor-sharp teeth and claws advances on you. However, unless you play a stealthy character, often your knife will be next to useless in combat; As will many of the game's sidearms, unless your primary's run dry. The game also features enemies of the variety of the environment; Anamolies.They're results of the radiation that envelopes the zone, and they're very dangerous; being anything from Static electricty that'll light you up like a christmas tree, to a minature vortex that pulls skin from the bone. All are usually dangerous, but the name of the game in S.T.A.L.K.E.R are the results of Anamolies; Artifacts. They're mysterious objects that grant mystical properties on the human body, from massively increased healing to bullet resistance. Of course, the game isn't flawless. There's many glitches in A.I., but you can't fault a game made in 2007 from a third party company for having some weaknesses. The number one problem with the game is it's voice acting and it's graphics - Even for the time it was released, it wasn't a pretty game. The voice acting is generally pretty atrocious, when it's there - Two of the more famous memes from the game result from this; (Come eehn! Doan juss stah ther!) (GEET OUYT OFF HEER STALKHERR), but overall, that's not the game's strength.Out of the three games, Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat; I would hesitate in calling this one the best. The other two have far stronger mechanical changes, as well as generally improved voiceacting and graphics.. However, Shadow of Chernobyl will always be the strongest in terms of the feel it gives you. You feel helpless, weak, and scared. Your life is valuable, and the zone can snatch it in an instant. The game doesn't baby you, nor does it hold back. You will die, and you'll love every second if you're a junkie for the things I've mentioned.IF TL:DR, LOOK HERE.Overall..[Starting score of 5 - An average game.]-PROS-Fantastic, immersive atmosphere (+2.5)A unique story and universe (+1.5)A powerful way to improve your character via artifacts (+1)Solid, if stiff mechanics (+1)-CONS-Glitchy, sometimes outright broken A.I. (-1)Horrendous Voice Acting (-1)Often uninventive areas (-1)-TOTAL-  -8.0-A powerful but sometimes unintuitive experience. It'll be memorable for it's unique combat, lore, and mechanics, but occasionally the things that bring down the experience really bring it down. Several times does it show off it's impressive concept of an apocalyptic world, but once or twice it falls short. If you're a fan of a deep, immersive game that'll take you a week or more to complete simply from just how difficult it can be, then this game's your one-trick pony. If not, you might be able to get some enjoyment from the pure russian that this game is. If not, then it likely isn't your sort of game. "

												A good survival-FPS I must say.Very much alike to the fallout series yet FPS becomes more dominant than RPG in this game.You can be a ninja and melee a group of super-mutants in fallout due to its rpg elements(perks,poweramor,etc),yet in STALKER you can only rely on your headshot skills and pray that the little bandit you are fighting won't throw a god-damn grenade right below your belt without even seeing where you are(And they hit the spot every time!).Current working on it and hope to beat it soon so I can get my hands on its sequel I've just bought.Anyway here are some pros and cons to summarize:Pros:1.Realistic pack-limit.When you play an open-world rpg,I bet most of you have developed a habit of looting every foe you kill and take everything so you can sell to a merchant to make money.Yet in this game you will find out soon enough that you can only carry so LITTLE.Normally I carry a rifle,one elite rifle just in case and a side arm pistol,some ammo,and a few bandages,medkits,anti-rads,and some everyday stuff.And THAT's ALL YOU CAN CARRY,if you loot and take everything from your enemy's corpse you won't get tired really fast(exceeding your pack limit) or even become completely immobilized(10 kg above your pack limit).2. Fantastic night sight and weather system.(Probably have some thing to do with the STALKER COMPLETE 2009 MOD)When the sun sets.It'be better if you crawled into your sleeping bag and actually sleep like in real life.If you dare to venture out at night you will find it hard to survive as you will either:A.Turn on the flash light and become a easy target and die quickly.B Turn off the flash and you can's see ♥♥♥♥!And also he weather system will change your sensibility and the sensibility of your enemies.During a rainy night the sounds will cover your footsteps for a sneak-in slit throat and you may be able to detect your enemy via the moonlight on a clear night.3.Atmosphere and sound effects are captivating.You can sometimes here the howl of a monster or some distant gunshots in a vast plain,as where as strange the cry of babies when you ventured in some underground tunnels.They really creates a horrifying atmosphere as if you are really in a apocalypse.And when you finally make it to a camp and take a deep breath,you will find it extremely comforting to see one of the fellow stalkers take out a guitar and slowly plays some gentle Russian folk tunes.Cons:1.Just like fallout ,the survival element aren't emphasized enough.The game time elapse the same speed in real world so you won't get hungry normally in one gameplay experience (say 2hours).You can manually speed up the time though and you will find soon enough when it gets dark and you can't see anything and regret changing that!(Sight at night is a pro BTW).2.Weapons feels really strange to handle.It feels like neither the normal FPS type(COD,Metro,Farcry,etc) nor the shooting simulator type(ARMA,Red Orchestra,etc).It just feels so strange,can't really tell what's wrong.3.No quick-save option.Even if you can do it via the COMPLETE MOD,you will generate a save file every time you quick save and I JUST DELETE 1GB of saves after about 5 hours of gameplay. And there's no quick travel mechanics as well.(The Mod add a teleport option and that literally means TELEPORT(1000 miles in 0 seconds and you can teleport to somewhere you haven't even been to)To conclude,as a fallout and survival game fan I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

Shadow of the Chernobyl is the first in the series and can still be a very rewarding game I would however suggest modding it for a more stable experience, the Steam version supports most popular mods.

												I buy 2 guns, then I'm so fat that I can't run for more than a minute. I eat a couple of sausages and drink vodka to lose some weight (ironic right?) I get so drunk that my head spins out of control. I manage to make my way into a bandit shoot out. By some act of God I was able to evade the bullets and I stumble away unharmed, I then find a group of STALKERs, sit down next to the one playing a guitar and before I know it a group of dogs attack us. I run away as best I could into an anomaly and explode into flames. Such is life in the zone- 10/10 This game is gold, would drink vodka again			"

												Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl is a highly enjoyable game with a lot of realism (I died about 15 times in the opening quest)the combat and survival aspects provide an enjoyable and difficult experience, unlike many games on the market you will not be likely to feel very powerful in Stalker, if your shot at point blank range with a shotgun you will definately die no questions asked, where this game suffers is mainly in problems due to age while it does feature an open world that world is segmented into pieces, their still expansive but don't expect giant areas.The second place this game has its shortfalls are simply graphical, this is simply because of the age of the game and the graphical limitations of the time, a HD remake would definately be in order.Overall if your not fanatical about Graphical quality or slightly older game mechanics, Shadow of Chernobyl provides a realistic enjoyable and throughly enjoyable open world, survival shooter experience.

												Hundreds of hours invested in this on the disc version purchased many moons ago. STALKER is a bleak, nightmareish vision brought to life even more so with the huge collection of community made mods available. This was the first game in the trilogy of games the other two being Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky (a prequal). Both of which are also incredible, CoP more so.When you leave the Cordon for the first time after speaking to Wolf, walking up that path towards the road, turning and seeing your brothers slowly disappear into the distance, hearing the wind howl around the barrel of your creaky old shotgun, suddenly hearing some sort of demonic cry far away to the east and a chill creeps down your back. The sun is low in the musty sky - but just up ahead there is an old abandoned mill to explore, just make use of the fading light.For me this game creates an atmosphere I've never felt before (or since, other STALKER titles not including) of a world gone to hell - the Zone, a huge area of land around the defunct Chernobyl reactor, now infested with nightmareish creatures deformed by radiation, different collections of (human) mostly factions wanting to kill you on sight and rob your last tin of tuna. Secret underground labs where horrific experiments happened before everything went to hell. Deserted farm buildings where blood hungry things lurk in the dark. STALKER is all about tension and fear, but also survival.There are mods you can get that improve just about every aspect of the original game, textures, weapons, music, audio, bugs ironed out, even previously unnavailble areas.I love STALKER, it's tremendously satisfying to survive in the Zone, it's terrifying, compelling and full of detail (if you also read all of lore/diary entries that Marked One enters into your PDA throughout the game.For anybody that likes FPS/open world survival shooters with strong RPG elements, for anybody that loves to become really immersed in their chosen universe, there is nothing quite like STALKER.Just don't forget your anti rads, and take care of Nimble - he's worth it.

												STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is, at its core, a unique, immersive shooter with a phenomenal AI.The gunplay is solid with plenty of weapon, ammo, and armor variety, and the game's open world and survival-oriented mechanics (hunger, radiation poisoning, bleeding, and a few others) set it apart from its peers and work to bring the Zone to life. One of its crowning features is the ALife (Artificial Life) system, which attempts to simulate a sort of persistent ecosystem throughout the Zone with roving, hierachical packs of mutants and wandering (or occasionally raiding) Stalkers, bandits, and soldiers. The graphics, while somewhat dated, are by no means ugly, and can be easily improved with mods.SoC is somewhat hampered by a plethora of bugs and sometimes frustrating design choices (irreversible weapon/armor decay) along with an overall weak plot and even weaker endgame. The game does, however, feature multiple endings, but the story isn't engaging enough for them to be particularly impactful. The world itself is still engaging and allows the player to very much craft their own stories, though it lacks any interactive vignettes such a setting would be conducive to. A personal gripe, I admit, but the Zone lacks in characters what it makes up for in atmosphere. While any mechanical issues can typically be modded away, the narrative can't really be improved upon.Word of warning - much of the ambient dialogue is in Russian, which, while immersive, sort of hampers interaction with any of the inhabitants. This is not as prevalent in the later titles, especially not in Call of Pripyat.			"

												Stalker has been considered by many a post-apocalyptic first person shooter game. But it isn't, your in a Cordon zone of the Chernobyl area that has been abandon since April of 1986 due to NPP4 catastrophic failure rendering the environment hazardous to live in. Yes, the place dose exists for real, all locations are based on real locations in the real zone. Life is still going on everyday for the people out side of the zone. The Stalker game series is inspired off the book ""Roadside Picnic"", which is a short science fiction novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky in 1971. More information on this book is available on a wiki, and the book is also available in English now.  The game is a open world exploration as well as mission directive, Remember that.Shadow Of Chernobyl is the first release of the stalker game series, not only is it less buggy, but the most mod friendly. I been in this zone since the first release of the dvd 1.0 in 2007. Back when modders were just starting out the great mega big mods that change the game story such as AMK, Inferno, Oblivion Lost, and Priboy came along pioneering the way to the mods of today. Matter in fact, some of the modders works can be found even in Clear Sky's dbase files like AMK is listed, some of the team even has scripts in it. Here your in the Cordon off Zone in which has become a prison. You can get in, but you can't get out. There is trading with traders, and different factions that may or may not care for you. Many dangerous anomalies to contend with, and artifact to collect and sell for money. Have to watch out for the areas that are radioactive still. One of the things to remember is question everyone and trust no one. Being skeptical with a gut feeling at times is better than a fire fight, When in this game it is important. It also in this game you have 3 alternate ending, pending on how or what you do will decide the end of your fate.. It works on win7 64 bit, you may want to check in the forums. There has been complaints pending Operating systems causing issues with the game. The stalker community out of many I have seen is the most helpful there. It seems every stalker dose what they can to help you. And a good community like that is a nice thing to have.  "

												STALKER SOC é um survival FPS open world muito bom, dificil e cheio de defeitos.Mesmo tendo gerenciamento de inventário e side quests, ele não tem nada de RPG - ele é mais um FarCry 2 do que Deus Ex HR.A história é interessante e surpreende um pouco. Contem três finais, bem diferentes e muito bons.A ambientação, atmosfera e trilha sonora são sensacionais.The Zone é um lugar que você precisa conhecer e explorar.As side quests são fracas e repetitivas, e o trading é ridiculo.As facções diferentes praticamente não fazem diferença no jogo.O gunplay é um pouco esquisito e alguns inimigos são simplesmente bullet sponges.Se for jogar pela primeira vez, não use MODs como Complete, Lost Alpha, Autumn Aurora pois eles alteram demais o jogo. Jogue o mais vanilla possivel, com pequenos MODs que só consertam bugs e melhoram a atmosfera como ZRP, Absolute Nature, AtmosFear, etc.Dou nota 8/10, recomendo, e com certeza está na minha lista Top 10.E 'get out of here, Stalker'!

												Yes, Stalker SoC is more than worth a buy. The feelings of dread and desperation as you traverse the insecure, almost-open-world will make you yearn for more while simultaneously hopping for it to stop.It’s Chernobyl. Because, somewhere, it had to be. Be glad it’s here though! Besides the technical issues that you may or may not experience at the hands of SoC, this is a damn fine game that mixes open levels, faction warfare as well as dark, claustrophobic maps. So well is the mixture that you will only take breaks to watch My Little Pony or Adventure Time episodes, in order to calm down a bit.That’s not to say that it’s all horror, but the horror parts are intense, with mutants invisible, sneaky or able to take control from you altogether. The remaining parts are equal in intensity, with stumbling over faction warfare, random anomalies or stalkers (a.k.a. wanderers) with whom you can talk for the info or kill for the loot. The world around you is also alive. Nights will see an intensity in animal and mutant activity, while daylight will witness packs of hounds hunting, wild boars migrating from one part of the (large) map to another and so forth. You will also constantly encounter random patrols or couriers, from different factions, the faction itself depending on the level you are in. But, like I originally said, the game is riddled with bugs. Some from the get-go, some due to the game being out of date. Of course, a title of this caliber will always have a smart fan-base covering it's needs, and there are excellent mods out there, combining graphics upgrades, tweaks and bug fixes all in one.The only reason I would not recommend getting this is if you already own Call of Pripyat (the 3rd game in the series, that improved much on the formula). If not, SoC is a serious contender to CoP, but ultimately, if you like one, you will want to play both. I recommend starting with this.			"

												STALKER is an example of a game that has numerous flaws, and yet manages to be amazing.  In fact, despite its bugs, unfinished and missing content, janky world etc. has managed to find a spot in my top 10 most beloved games of all time.  Not only that, it is the one game that has sold me on the concept of a survival game.  The Zone is a trecherous, scary place that is caked in so much atmopshere that it's hard not to feel as though every step you take is one step closer to your own untimely demise, and nothing is as satisfying as making it out of a rough encounter without bleeding to death or barely escaping an irradiated area after you realized you didn't pack enough anti-rads.  You are NEVER safe in this game.  Ever.  Admittedly Shadow of Chernobyl is the most linear of the three STALKER games, but honestly each one is cheap enough that you should just get all 3.  If you want a more open world, then play Clear Sky or even better Call of Pripyat.  But Shadow fo Chernobyl is still a gripping experience and a great starting point for this wonderful, creepy world - and there are lots of mods out there worth checking out, as well as the excellent standalone game STALKER: Lost Alpha which seeks to recreate STALKER based on its original design document and the many features that were cut during its lengthy 6 year development time.  Definitely check this one out.			"

												There it is. I wanted to play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. since it's release after i have read an article on it. Now after 32h of game i have completed the story mode, what can i say? This game is definetly not for every one. It's specific atmosphere is somewhat depressing, well, there should not be any surprise on this as ti is a part of game.My first impression when i started to play was that camera movement is kind of weird, but after a while i got used to it. Next weird thing was shooting mechanism, to desctibe it in one sentence: ""I shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the head and then he kiled me"". I have wrote about atmosphere if the game, but there is more to it. If i would have to choose what genre this game is i would say something between survival horror, sneaking game and FPS. Game is not scary all the time, but there are some locations that can give you a goosebumps, like lab x-16 or x-18, or any other location, where you have to use a flashlight and creepy noises are all around.Nice thing in game was possibity to pick up gun from your fallen enemies. During gameplay i didn't have to buy any of primary weapon, all of them can be droped by mobs, however some of them are quite rare, like Gaus Gun. I have picked it up on very end of the game in Chernobyl NPP sarkophagus.Another thing that i liked was posibility to sneak on almost every enemy including mutants, sometimes i is quite handy, that you can try to kill a baddie with a single shot (ammo conservation is important cause you don't want to be left with a knife, trust me ;)Gameplay of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in  overall was nice, after i got used to it, despite some frustrating moments, of F7, F7, F7, F7 ;). This is another thing that you should remember of: quick save whenever you are sure you are safe. If you forget to save, you can lost your progress very easily as on every stage of game almost every enemy can kill you fast.For me this is a nice game and i don't feel disappointed, now it is time for second part :)I would recommend this game to everybody who is not affraid of exploring radiated teritorries of Chernobyl outskirts and want to have their whish granted :)TIP: In game you have to run a long distances, at the beginning use energy drinks, later equip yourself with artifact Flash x2 or Moonlight x2 or combination of those two. They will give you infinite stamina when you are not too loaded and if you walk because you run out, your stamina will regenerate.			"

												Best atmosphere of any video game possibly ever.. Cringeworthy AI/Combat bullet dmg however.(The amazing atmosphere, guns, sounds, mutants, visuals of this game outweight the poor AI cons a million to one)I am not mad or angry writing this review. I am perfectly calm. Not butthurt. I love that stalker exists and technically speaking is one of the most impressive fps game engines i've ever experienced. I am still enjoying the game right now actually. I know this will hurt your feelings bringing up some negatives but its what i observe from playing the game again in 20161.Terrible AI. Sadly this is true.-Sometimes enemies will tactically walk into the room.. backwards??-you can walk up to a bandit camp with a non-silenced rifle, shoot one of the three patrol guards in the head.. watch him drop.. then just watch his friends walk around his dead body like nothing happened. -You shoot a guard, watch him flinch, see the blood spatter, and he will just continue patrolling without becoming alarmed or doing anything differently-Enemies do not respond to sounds or flashlights, they just automatically face you when you come within 15ft of them (regardless if you are sneaking or not)Once you get a little way into the game, It takes about 1-2 headshot to kill, or... 30-70 body shots. I wish i was being sarcastic. How could a game with so much realism ingrained into the atmosphere possibly have such an insultingly unrealistic bullet damage system? It takes smart people to make such a realistic engaging atmosphere like this. So i am surprised that they all collectively agreed on this arcade-like bullet damage system. I just wish it was more realistic (3-5 body shots for medium armor enemies, 7 body shots for heavy armor enemies)**UPDATE** The above statement needs to be re-visited, yes it does take a lot of shots to kill an enemy.. But after playing for many more hours i have determined that this game is set up more like an RPG than a traditional FPS. It makes sense because the developers want you to come across better geared enemies as you go deeper through the game. Although it does feel silly having to shoot an enemy with 70 body shots at times. So...Continuing with the horrors of AI. They rarely respond to gunshot sounds, if they do its completely incorrect and they walk to the wrong locationIf you see an enemy in a window and fire at him, you would expect him to look out the window and return fire.. But no. The AI just gets confused, walks around in that room for a bit then crouches and aims at a wall until you walk upstairs and kill him as he stares at the wall.If you are behind a big 6 inch steel wall or something, enemies will just shoot at the wall till the end of timeThe game does have a lot of positive things too however, the graphics are top notch, the sounds are FLAWLESS, the controls and user interface is very fitting for the atmosphere..

												First thing: tried in windows 7 32bit game was crashing every 5 minutes, so i had to install in a computer with windows xp where the game never crashed one single time.I am a purist, so i like to play games as they are released by the original developers, for me, installing any MOD is the same as using cheats and i hate cheats too, so i've played this game without any mod and my review is based on that.So, let me start with this, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a GREAT game, really, the ambientation is fantastic and so are the graphic and music, i would have given this game without problem a score of 80 and above but, i really could not, because of too many flaws.A part the fact the game is full of many mini bugs, but nothing you can't handle with, when you start for the first time, you'll face an insane level of difficuly that in other games of this kind i rarely experienced....you shoot in the face for 3 times a bandit with a gun and he survive and shoot you back...this can't be, but in this game this will happens...Moving, by feet, from one point of the map to other take ages, a problem that in other 2 Stalker games was solved...One of the most annoying things was that you can NOT repair your weapons or your armors, you must find a new one once some of your gears get damaged too much, again, a problem solved in other 2 Stalkers...The game is overall very hard but the final part is something ridiculously hard, evenn too much, altough, maybe, was one of the best final fights i did among all 3 Stalker games...There are radiations everywhere :-)So, in conclusion, the game is very well made, it's good, but is very far from perfection, i would recommend it only to hardcore gamers, others are adviced...My Final Score is 70 /100  "

												i am a HUGE fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games(well..maybe not Clear Sky but it had some good things which were improved in Call of Pripyat),when i first saw the screenshots of Shadow of Chernobyl back in 2005-2006 i knew deep within it was a game i would dig,and i did...more than i actually thought i would,i am in love with this game,it's setting is amazing and original,especially for it's time and because ever since i heard about the accident back in 1986 i was interested in it and seeing a FPS made in it without it being ""yeah you shoot dudes in Pripyat to save some dude you don't care about"" and more like ""you have to survive and scrape your ♥♥♥♥ together and if you don't look out you will be murdered..gruesomely"" was like a dream come true,the series' strongest point is by far the amazingly gloomy atmosphere,(the voice acting sucks though,first thing you have to do is download the original,Russian soundfiles and put them into the game,it makes the game 10x better) and the fact in every game you start out with the most shity equipment(that being the Makarov pistol) it takes skill to actually be good at the game,and when you take down that bandit camp near the millitairy checkpoint in the Cordon in SoC for the first time on your own with just a pistol and if you are lucky a sawed off shotgun,you feel great(and even get rewarded with usefull stuff if you do it that way!) the series have loads of original ideas,like the concept of anomalies and them being lethal if you don't have good equipment,the sometimes extreme background radiation also really adds to the setting of the place(that being the 30 square kilometer Zone in which the fallout was the heaviest) and the wide variety of weapons,armors and artifacts(being little trinkets you can sell for good cash and provide boons like extra resistance against bites and bleeding and extended endureance so that can sprint longer) the music is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic,especially in the later levels,and the main menu theme is depressing and actually really gloomy aswell,which fits the series' overall atmosphere all in all i love the series,especially the first game and the fact that to this day,there is a thriving modding community for SoC is a reason for me to go back from time to time and experience the horrors of the Zone once more well,what are you waiting for? buy the game already and good hunting Stalker!

												I just played and completed this for the first time and despite it being almost a decade old, it was one of the best shooters I've played in a long time.The game truly makes you feel alone in the Zone; you'll learn a lot as you play, almost every encounter is incredibly dangerous, and you'll be scavenging for ammo at every opportunity.I'd recommend playing on 'Master' difficulty, as the enemies are bullet sponges on lower difficulties and 'Master' doesn't really become ridiculously difficult until the end of the game.

If you´re thinking of start playing Shadow of Chernobyl I recommend you to start with Clear sky (is in Steam too), it is ""the first episode"" of the trilogy and like Star Wars saga the Stalker saga was not maded in the cronological order.

												Don't mind hour count. Had this as a physical copy, in the first place, way before Steam.This game is the pinnacle of post apocalyptic games. Pure survival. Constantly low ammo, low medicines, broken armour and weapons, and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of spooky enemies everywhere. You can also perish for not eating or drinking, not to mention radiation. And not to mention gravitational/eletromagnetic anomalies you'll stumble into while running for your life, or searching for radioactive artifacts, that will either way kill you hopelessly. Everytime you leave your safe haven to start a quest, it feels like a true adventure... and you're never sure you'll be back in one piece on the first try. Most of the time, you won't. Be ready to cry, to yell, to pray, to hunt down bandits in the darkness, to spray your last AK magazine towards invisible tentacle-faced abominations in order to desperately try to save your life, to drink ♥♥♥♥♥ons of vodka, and most importantly, to cheeki breeki.10/10			"

												I just played and completed this for the first time and despite it being almost a decade old, it was one of the best shooters I've played in a long time.The game truly makes you feel alone in the Zone; you'll learn a lot as you play, almost every encounter is incredibly dangerous, and you'll be scavenging for ammo at every opportunity.I'd recommend playing on 'Master' difficulty, as the enemies are bullet sponges on lower difficulties and 'Master' doesn't really become ridiculously difficult until the end of the game. Most importantly, apply the fix shown at the link below to cure mouse input lag and other anomalies otherwise present in the Steam version:http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1408781 "

												A one of a kind horror/shooter with a compelling plot, fantastic array of weapons and equipment, an immersive world, and an interesting array of factions and personalities. I recommend this particularly to fans of Metro 2033/Last Light as a more challenging and atmospheric alternative, despite being a good few years old, the game has aged well and (as far as I have experienced.) Runs smoothly; it contains a very nice inventory system also. The plot follows a Russian 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R' who has come to the zone to scavenge for artifacts after a fictional second explosion at the Chernobyl reactor, but suffers amnesia. The rest picks up from there. Despite the stellar experience, I do find the game is plagued by steep difficulty curves, an unusable stealth mechanic (the HUD has a sound metre but as far as I know, stealth isn't possible unless the enemy is sleeping.) And I found a lot of the areas looking a little too similar to one another, however, this doesn't tarnish this true gem of modern times.10/10 Would cheeki breeki again.			"

												Nostalgia prevents me from delcaring this my top game over HL2, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is brilliant. It's certainly highly flawed in some aspects (nothing that a few of the many avaliable mods can't fix), it manages to capture the eerie beauty and tantalizing allure of the mysterious and dangerous. Fusing horror, immersion, realism, gunplay, and atmosphere without any subtracting from another and without, sacrificing any of the 'fun' factor, as many overly-ambitious games do. It creates an expansive, ominous world, (rivaling that of Fallout) riddled with sprawling underground bunkers and tunnels and military and commercial complexes full of loot and danger. The gunplay is intense and real-feeling, as you have as much HP as most humans and take equal damage from weapons, leaving you only with the advantage of wits and strategy when going up against a well-equipped opponent, and the mutants are terrifying and strangely numerous. Creeping nervously through a dark subterranean laboratory and peeking around a corner to glimpse some strange, grotesque creature you've never seen before is never loses it's thrill, and is a perplexingly common occcurence, even after playing the game for some time. The game's faults (dismal ambient sounds, bugs, etc.) are more than tolerable given the game's many and unique strengths. All in all, fantastic game. 9.1/10			"

I've spent hours in this game, between creeping through Bloodsucker infested underground tunnels, to huddling in a corner while I wait for night to pass.

Game had me playing for hours & hours, it has so many different things and systems you can explore and proceed in many different ways. Just has me playing and playing just because of the several ways you can play through it, and many different and interesting endings and gameplay routes within it. I highly recommend this game.

												Let's just say I love this game, #1 fav, always. If you have never heard of this game, then you're in for a treat. This game has got an enjoyable and replayable story, not to mention some of the mods for this game (StalkerSoup, Oblivion Lost, AMK, Doom's Mod Merge being my favorites). If you are just starting out on this game, play it through in vanilla on first playthrough (just a warning it.. can be sometimes buggy and unpredictable in vanilla, from my experience anyway) and once you've completed the game, I would recommend downloading a mod. It can be any mod of your choice (obviously) but I would highly recommend something like AMK or Oblivion Lost, they're both fairly simplistic, both add new features but nothing too big. They also add things like new weapons, armour and what not, don't worry, it doesn't dumb the game down like that awful excuse for a mod Stalker Complete, it's still a challenge, so never fear! As for StalkerSoup, it is difficult I would only recommend this to experienced STALKER players (!seriously!) but you can have a go if you want. If you haven't got this game, what are you actually waiting for? GOTY 2007 10/10			"

												one of those games which, on one hand, looks and plays rather crudely compared to other fps games, and yet, outshines them in that strange way you can't put a finger on. if you find yourself into this game despite the initial impression it grants, you will have an experience which many games offer, but few games can actually present, of being isolated, exploring a strange, dangerous wasteland, and yet somehow feeling an odd alien wonder to it all. it all comes together in a way that leaves a lasting impression, if you dont just end up hating it for being a janky hunk of ♥♥♥♥.

												Where do I start with this game? I've played through it twice and am currently on my third play through after beating the trilogy a few years ago. I downloaded the STALKER Complete 2009 mod which I hoped would refresh the game without introducing stupid gameplay imbalances. I was right. It's still one of the greatest and most demanding open-world first person role playing games out there. And I think I would be justified in saying that it on its own rivals the AAA competitors like Fallout 3 or New Vegas. It's just that good.It plays really nicely, and because it's such an old game it runs smoothly with high anti-aliasing and high frame rates. As a core game you are sort of thrown into the combat with little preparation, but it doesn't take an experienced shooter-player to realize that you need to duck and cover. Leaning is super important, and enemies like to shoot when you move forcing you to play patiently and not go commando. That being said, once you get the formula down, you just sit and pop enemies when they poke their heads out. Pretty standard. The real challenge is fighting monsters which will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and really put your twitch-shooter skills to the test. Interacting with friendlies and setting out on quests is easy enough, but oftentimes the quests will end in ways you don't expect due to the uncertain nature of everything occurring in the game-world. You plan an ambush with some buddies and only you made it out? That's your fault but you gotta move on.The Complete 2009 mod really polishes off the game nicely. Textures are still pretty sharp, and the world is brimming with anomalies and enemies. You really notice the subtle touches like rain pouring outside and forcing friendlies to huddle inside next to barrel stoves. The sound is good but definitely dated. I really like having to use directional sound to orient myself and in a game like this that feature really stands out. The day-night cycles are intense and I found myself sleeping through the nights so as to have a daylight advantage in combat.The story is super intriguing and really enhanced by the dark and radioactive atmosphere. Everything could be dangerous and you gotta be on your game if you want to make it out alive. What's awesome is that you can play this game multiple times and get fairly different experiences in terms of the narrative and your late-game character's attributes. Some people go full ecologist and collect anomalies to enhance their character. Some seek the best guns ever. Some have the best armor. It's all pretty standard for the genre, but it is executed well and provides a player with a large range of choices to make throughout the story.Addendum: So I beat it after reloading a quick save every 15 minutes because holy ♥♥♥♥ the monolith stalkers really throw everything in the game at you including gunships, mutants, armor piercing ammunition, and their sheer numbers (I killed maybe 40 in the last part of the game?). I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't, but I will address the ""incoherence"" some people claim the game's story is guilty of. I am pretty sure that the curators that made that claim were either skipping through all the dialogue, or just refuse to acknowledge that a team of devs outside of the United States can make a compelling, unique, and deeply original story. Or maybe game journalists are all ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I think that's most likely.This game is not appealing to the same crowds that find the Fallout or Metro games appealing, and I think that the reason for that is in the fantasies and idealized situations the game constructs for the player. It really does give you the sensation of being inna woods with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soviet guns that jam all the time fighting hostile creatures and violently entrepreneurial bandits. You also get the neat sensation of collecting artifacts for science, and doing so under the constant oppression of the military and rival paramilitary factions that seemingly have no scientific aims. While in this debut title, there is no explicit faction-joining for the player, you do participate and witness the war for these radioactive artifacts, and it absolutely informs your player-choices that do in fact yield wildly different endings to the game--bad endings if you're a lazy and stupid player that doesn't read dialogue. I have beaten this game 3 times now I think? I'll never be able to eat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spam knock-offs again without thinking about my misadventures in the zone scrounging for artifacts, assassinating corrupt military commanders and bandits, and drinking a dozen handles of vodka to make the radiation sickness go away. If you're intrigued play it and get hooked and maybe you'll pick up Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat which I'll review at some point.			"

												*********************MAKE SURE TO MOD IT FOR THE FULL EXPIERENCE!!!!*************************One of my favorite up-to date single player free roams. I would rather play any S.T.A.L.K.E.R games rather then Far cry 4, Dying Light, and even GTA 5 ETC. This game, hence any other S.T.A.L.K.E.R has so much replay value it's insane. And if you think you've done it all, there's hundreds of amazing mods out there that you can replay your expierence.

												Every now and then a game which is one-of-a-kind and offers a completely unforgettable experience is made. This is one of those games. If you haven't tried S.T.A.L.K.E.R. before then now is the time. This FPS/RPG provides a realistic experience through proper weapon and damage mechanics and a special ""A-Life"" AI engine which allows The Zone to continue living and changing even when the player isn't there. This game does not provide an easy start for newcomers, dropping you into the harsh and desolate Zone with nothing but a jacket and a pistol. But it will reward players who continue onward using common sense and quick judgement to overcome the myriad of obstacles on their journey to the Center of The Zone. If you haven't tried this game, try it. But don't try for 5 minutes and then give up because it's ""too hard"". Give it a couple of hours and in those hours think to yourself ""If I was actually in The Zone, what would I do?""Good hunting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. See you in The Zone.			"

												You are a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.One of the many mercenaries throughout Chernobyl that hunt artifacts formed by radioactive anomalies that do impossible things. Such as absorbing radiation, increasing resistances, granting health generation, or giving you near infinite stamina.These artifacts are sought out after by scientists and stalkers alike, and can fetch large quantities of money, making the zone a goldmine for anyone brave enough to traverse its dangerously unforgiving atmosphere.The game feels much more RPG than FPS, because every time you wield a gun it feels like an inaccurate wet noodle with a crooked barrel, while all your stalker friends, neutrals, and enemies have perfect laser beam accuracy and can take a clip to the face and live, while you get pinned to the ground dead at mach 10 if a stray bullet so much as brushes past your cheek. Even the illusive sniper rifles are weirdly inaccurate, and yes I know what bullet falloff and spread is, but this is ridiculous.If you can get used to the gunplay, it provides a satisfying experience once you consistently take down enemies, watch them flop to the ground, loot all their corpses, and waddle back to the shop to pawn it all.So S.T.A.L.K.E.R, get questing, killing mutants, shooting dudes, collecting artifacts, exploring creepy corridors, and taking in the sights of the hazardous deathtrap that is the zone.

												I love this because I love singleplayer experience gameplay that allows you to roam around with whatever equipment you want. There's a good mix of freedom, side missions, and storyline missions that you have to complete to progress. You can always go backwards, hunt for things, sell your treasures, and buy weapons and ammo untill the endgame. The endgame itself is long and multi-choice, taking me totally by surprise at how epic it turned out to be. I was completely satisfied with it seeing how such a modest game could unmask itself as being so brilliant. I wish I'd played it sooner and had higher expectations with it, or I might never have tried it out. If you enjoy this and want a multiplayer version, I think DayZ mod for Arma 2 feels quite similar.			"

												I freaking love this game. Its fabulous with a few mods. Just had to stop playing to type up this review. I was tasked with finding and killing another s.t.a.l.k.e.r.. He was in Dark Valley with a group of friends. They were netrual to me which was nice. After I entered their little hamlet not only did they try to swindle me out of 800 roubles (and fail) then heckle me about Robin Hood or some noise; but the one i needed to kill was leaving with a group of his friends. Hehe a perfect time to strike I tell myself. As i begin to follow them the last one in a line out the narrow gate stops. I bump into him, he stays still like a flapping mountain. I look in disbelief as Artyom Smartass fattys the door infront of me. (I'm not even kidding that was his real name) I can't take the troll so I shout ""A Nuu Cheeki Breeki Iv Damke!!"". As i murder him 3 of his 4 friends turn around and begin firing on me. One of them is the target.  I dispatch them quickly with my rifle and and loot them fearing that the fourth will turn on me soon as he seems to have not noticed the gunshots not 2 hecking feet away. I walk up and speak with the man who refused to fight me, all he would say when I spoke with him was ""Hey."" his name was, Yarik Chill. This. ♥♥♥♥ing. Game. <3			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a great game. One of my favorites. I've been told modding it makes it the most fun, but I haven't done that yet.STALKER is has some bugs, silly voice acting (some characters only have one line and will repeat it every time you come into view: google ""Get out of here stalker"", or ""I said come in, don't stand there""), but overall it's a great game.Similiarities and differences: STALKER is most similar to Metro: 2033, probably because they are some of the same people who made it. It is not very similar to Fallout 3, other than the large world (Fallout 3 is much larger) but there is no level system, no experience points. Just reputation with factions, which basically means ""Did you kill any Duty members? Did you kill any Freedom members?"" since these are the only real factions in the game which don't initially hate you.Mechanics: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is an exploration based game, if I had to call it something. The world is filled with anomalies that hurt you as you stand near. Throwing a bolt in the direction of one will activate it, showing you where it is. Expensive ""artifacts"" will fall out of them sometimes, and they will have various effects on your character. For instance, there is one that increases health regeneration but decreases bullet defense, and all other defense. It is terrible. There is also my favorite, Moonlight, which increases Endurance and decreases electrical defense.Endurance is the system of sprinting, carrying things, etc. If you are over-encumbered, and you walk places, your endurance will slowly go down. If you sprint, it will instantly go down. Having an endurance boosting artifact is one of the best things in the game because it gives endless sprinting when below 50 KG and longer sprinting above that. You cannot carry very much and must be very careful with inventory management. Side-missions will reward artifacts and special weaponry. They have a time limit. One set of side missions unlocks the ""true"" ending, you should save multiple times in the end of the game to ensure you get that, and look up how to unlock these side missions before going into Chernobyl. The storyline has you going from different areas into the game, until you get to the top of Army Warehouses, which is the end-game area. The shooting mechanics are very nice. Everyone, including you, has low health. Guns are inaccurate, damaging, and have bullet drop. Headshots are very powerful and can lead to a quick death, which makes this game hard for you too. There are many different guns and armors, many different bullet types. Rifles, Grenade Revolvers, Handguns, SMGs, shotguns, gauss gun, rocket launcher, sniper rifles. You can equip one major weapon and one pistol at the same time. To switch them out, you need to go into inventory. I love this game and it has a great open-world exploration aspect of it. Anomalies, bandits, mutants, and monolith are your enemies and the zone watches your fights.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl is an elder russian game which is a post-apocalyptic, ""open-world""-ish FPS game. (no this is not a fallout wannabe, even though at first glance it seems to be)This game it not perfect, nor that beautiful, and there are bugs and errors.But why am I then recommending this game? 'cause nothing is perfect, young padawan.The quality of the game gets highly increased if you mod the game, I did only play with weight mods, so I can bear a ton XD but there are lots of other quite interesting mods out there.Lets firstly take the ""killers"" of this game.- The game can crash a lot for some people, for me it was a very few times, there can be weird errors here and there but nothing that can't be fixed either with a reload, restart or just by ignoring it.- It is an old game, it is from 2007, so the grafic is only okay, not ugly but not pretty, and it is a russian game, I am not against russians gamedevelopers, they have created truly unique games like the stalker franchies, the hard truck apocalypse franchies and lots more. But it is wellknown that there can be a lot of bugs, luckily this one only has a few.- Better agrosystem. You can, if you snipe friendly target, kill them and if killed by one shot, you will therefore not be attracting agro to you, therefore you can kill all of your allies and loot them if you want to and still be ally with their fraction.- without any doubt there is missing a little bit of more detailed landscaping, more weapons, maybe a little more work on the plot and other small things. (not that the game is missing a lot on these things) Then there is the sunshines of this game- If you like a game which you can set to a hard difficulty, then this game is for you. You cannot be rambo in this game, not on higher difficulty, and if you choose to remove your sight of your weapon, then it gets a hell lot more fun(this game prepared me for killing floor to shoot without a weaponsight)- The atmosphere.... uuuhhh that is the one reason I really love this franchies, it has really caught this dark, lonely, chaotic and sometimes horrifying post apocalyptic atmosphere. It is not a game which ""romantice"" the post apocalyptic setting which many other post apocalyptic games do(not that it is bad, but it is great to get this realistic, ""autentic"" post apocalyptic atmosphere""- interesting monsters, they have been quite creative with some of their monsters, especially some of the rare ones did frighten the ♥♥♥♥ out of me when I encountered them for the first time, especially the one which could affect your mind.- multiply endings! I didn't know this before I read about it, but this game has different endings! Of course now many games now at days, even FPS games, have different endings, but for me it is really a plus especially when this is an old game :) - Interesting univers/world/setting, lore and plot. Even though the plot wasn't the best in the world, there was still enough of mystery to this setting, that you wanted to explore more. - I love the real russian feel of the setting, because you really felt that you are in chernobyl because  the dialouge is in english with a heavy lovely Russian accent, then the NPCs talked russian to one another while you are walking by. But I have to say, I am a big sucker for the Russian language. :P so that is why I have this as a proSo yeah is this game better than fallout? No, especially not this one which is the first one in this franchies, go look for the newer installments, they are a lot better than this one. But if you have been playing through all fallout games and still crave for a postapocalyptic world, then this series brings another perspective and alternative setting(because it is not the whole world, only the closed world of chernobyl which are the setting)And yeah it is recommended to mod it(just like fallout) :)			"

												Talk about a game with immersion - Having played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SOC on retail disk countless times and then regretably selling it, I jumped at the chance to pick up the Steam version cheap on Ebay.You play as the ""Marked One"" and your travels will take you across the vast wasteland of the Zone near the Chernobyl NCP in the Ukraine.  This open ended blended RPG FPS will keep you plenty occupied with enough playtime to log countless hours.  There are a number of quests and side missions to partake in or just venture the Zone and kill mutants and search for artifiacts if you please - this i what I do sometimes to kill time and play around in the world.. just to enjoy its menacing atmosphere.The immersion and atmosphere is deliciuosly unique and the Stalker series is my fav regarding a creepy feeling.  I use the ""Complete"" mod available at artistpavel.com and it intensifies the atmosFEAR and graphics as well as does a complete overhaul of the game for a more stable experience.  Real time weather and day/night cycles are a treat to behold.  Sound and Music is great with eerie/spooky ambience throughout, gun effects are realistic.The graphics look stunning for portraying the grislt world of the zone which is a treacherous, darkly beautiful radioactive wasteland.  For as big as the game is the world looks fantastic and considering its a few years old.This is a hard game (my opionion) and I think is designed toward a more die hard PC player - it is not run and gun - you will die plenty.  The A.I. is tuff and smart - dodge and cover is there motto.   The first time you encounter a controller watch out - one of my favorite enemies ever.  Nearly half my friends list already has this gem, so they know a great game when they see it.Good hunting Stalker.  ✔Recommended			"

This game will rock your socks and pack an amazing graphical package even for a game made in 2007! This game was groundbreaking in it's time, and it's hard to believe (Okay, well, except for engine bugs. it's not like source.) It's an old game. First in the series, i'd reccomend you to get this game first in the series. As any other part of the game wouldn't make sense. And, with mods, this game will have you coming back for more and more. (and more!) [EDIT: MODS SHOULD ONLY BE APPLIED AFTER PLAYING THROUGH THE 'VANILLA' UNMODDED STORYLINE A MINIMAL TIME OF ONCE. TRY VANILLA BEFORE SPRINKLES.] This game's really quite better than the other two, in my opinion. Please, If you like fallout NV and are a bit upset with how 4 turned out, Try this game, at least once. If you don't like it, you can complain to me. But I bet you'll like it for one reason or another.EDIT:I have racked up over 600 hours of this game, (12/2/13) making it nearly surpass my most played game (Mabinogi, 1500+hrs) in at least half the time. (~4 years? yikes.)I can COMFORTABLY SAY that this game does NOT get old despite the linear story, if you ignore that and make your own storyline out of it, jee wilikers, it can get intense. personally my most reccomended game ever wowie zowie.n if eny of u fukz wana sey it 'lookz b@d', u guyz dun cumplein boot fullout's werd chererter desiens, u laff at it. u shuld do det wifh stukler "

												In T.A.L.K.E.R. you play as a TALKER who are known for being a every day man working at a desk job who really wants to get up and talk to people. TALKER stands forTalkAskListenKeyboardEat♥♥♥♥As you can see every one of these things have to do with the every day job of a white collar business man. Truely deep.

												Haven't had this much fun exploring and killing things since my skyrim days on the PS3. This game is soooo good. The atmosphere, the guns, the monsters, and the difficulty in surviving is just perfect! It's not too hardcore and not too soft IMO. You will have to use cover when gun batling or fighting and sometimes you will run away in fear.

												I killed my first bandit, looted him, ate the bread he had, and made my game crash 10/10But for real this game is amazing and unforgiving. I played the whole game on the easiest difficulty, ""Novice"" I think it was called and it was still challenging.My word of advice is to get the Vintar sniper rifle in the base of this faction called ""Freedom"" which is located in the Military Warehouses area. The Vintar is probably my most favorite weapon in the game.I say the game is unforgiving because I made a quicksave in the CNPP (Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant) and kept dying of radiation, going back to the quicksave, and dying of radiation again, and repeat. That was entirely my fault for not bringing enough anti-radiation and medical supplies with me.All enemies do pose a challenge, at least until you get a really good weapon or two, then some of the enemies become easier to kill. The enemies you fight can be easy peasy bandits, challenging military, or deadly mutants that can kill you almost instantly.You can find these artifacts that help you out on your adventures in The Zone (Chernobyl Exclusion Zone) which give you enhancements. For example, you can get a artifact that increases your resistance to bullet damage but makes you more radioactive slightly. These artifacts can fetch a good price to traders so you can make some money in your pocket which you can use to buy guns, ammunition, armor, medical supplies, food, and more from traders.I'll stop the review right here because I don't know what the hell else to talk about. This game is a solid 10/10 for me.			"

 S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:Shadow of Chernobyl  If you are looking for a game that holds your hand a babies you with autosaves and an easy difficulty you will not find it here. Now, I am one who started off with Call of Pripyat and jumping to this game I was a bit dissapointed by the very barebones system of game mechanics but with the instalation of a mod, I managed to really get into the universe.The world is terrifying. There are few games that scare me but are so alluring at the same time.This game got everything right about a nuclear wasteland in a very stylized and brutal way.First off, let me tell you reasons  why you should buy it.  Immersive and terrifying game world Unforgiving and hardcore gameplay Interesting universe full of lore Challenging gunplay AN-94 Difficult AI opponents Unique theme, Chernobyl is loads of fun to explore A large variety of enemies A unique survival expirience Convincing atmosphere Beautiful, creepy, and immersive sound design Large modding community that includes additional storylines/ areasNow here are some of the reasons  I might not suggest this game.  Loads of bugs Clunky movement system Poor balance, I had to install a mod for the game to be playable. (S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Complete 2009) Very badly dated athstetics Weak/Almost non exsistant story Dissapointing/Unfulfilling ending ""Open world"" is divided into VERY small areas Built on the most offensively terrible game engine I have ever played a game on At 8 years old has aged severly Anomalies are EVERYWHERE killing you almost instantly setting you back to your last save (SO SAVE CONSTANTLY)The ending of this game throws any fraction of balance there may have been out of the window. I was expecting so much more from the end of the game and all it ended up being was a frustrating shooting gallery, with no final boss fight. I was expecting far far more from this game coming from Call of Pripyat. If you have finished this game you know exactly what I am talking about, not to mention the fact that when you beat the game with that terrible ending, thats it. No more exploration. No selling your mad loot for an epic weapon. Nothing.The game just send and gives you the chance to replay the ending again. Thats it.Now S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was supposed to be the game to make up for all of this, but sadly it was killed off just like the staff of the nuclear reactor after the melt down.The game also has a surprising lack of mutants. That was supposed to me the main horror factor of this game but they stopped showing up to the part about half way through leaving me feeling a little unsatisfied.There was only a hand full of times this game really had me scared, and they were short lived. Would I reccomend this game? If you are willing to install a mod or two and overlook all the cons this game has then it is for sure a yes from me.But only if the good things I listed really interests you.If this game does not really grab your attention, then I would reccomend for $20 you hold off on this one. If you are not all that interested than you really aren't going to miss out. "

												I wanted to write a review a long time ago, but didn't know what to say, here it goes.This is a great game with a beautiful, well developed story and realistic at the same time, it is based on a real life disaster which occured in 1986, in the nuclear reactor Chernobyl, close to the city of Pripyat. Only lack i find here is the lack of multiplayer, since i think this would go great in multiplayer, however it is bearable since it's a 2007 game, when gaming wasn't so full of multiplayer. I was always attracted to these types of games, so i might exaggarate. I just have 11 hours so far but i'm ready to go deeper into it, now i need to go to the lab X18 which is known to be the most scary, it's night time so i'm at the bar preparing for the day, another thing is a lack of skipping a night, this is my 2nd night, and i need to wait, it's around 0.5h. You see all these games about surviving in a post apocalyptic world, like DayZ, well, stalker started it, and it started well. One of the things i find priceless is sitting around the fire or at the bar and enjoying with fellow NPC stalkers, too bad it's only NPCs. Anyways, if you are looking for a good game, this is for you. 8/10.			"

												A great game that has inspired many other great titles. S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a game that has an awe inspiring atmosphere, perfected with user Mods and Patches such as the Stalker Complete 2012 Mod. This game would get you creeped out, wary and leave you with mild insomnia for days. With content spanning at least 12 hours of constant gameplay, you would be hooked regardless. Stepping away only for food, toilet and to give yourself a hand-job.I wrote this 5 Hours in, and i can say that i only got past the 'Tutorial' area and into ""The Garbage"". With 82 Bullets left in my Fort-15 and a magazine left in my MP5. I have never been this wary of any engagement than anything else.My gun jams half the time if try to fire, my armor is close to breaking apart. At least i have 5 Kilos of Vodka.This game brought forth games like Metro. Inspired some elements into DayZ. A darker version of Fallout. Harder than Nails to play and equally satisfying.10/10>Cheeki Breeki			"

												Grab a surplus Soviet gas mask and a bottle of vodka for this great game, I absolutely love it. This game combines FPS elements with horror, all with a survival feel. The combat is paced pretty well and the story is quite good. The game can get a bit hard at times, but those occasions are not too common, and I may just suck. The creators of this game deserve a hug and a brohoof, I strongly recommend it.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a timeless classic in my opinion. I'm sure many agree with me - it was my first venture into computer gaming many years ago (2008 is when I picked it up originally, I believe). Set in and around the area of Chernobyl (obviously), the world is open for you to explore and discover your identity, as you are an amnesiac. The games' structure is pretty evenly paced for the most part, however there is a very, very steep learning curve at the beginning if you are used to run-and-gun style games (particularly the first mission, where you are outnumbered and unequipped to handle the situation if you don't use tactics). You'll encounter everything from run-of-the-mill thugs and highly trained soldiers, all the way down to mutated beasts and telekenetic monsters throughout your journey. Overall, the game is a bit buggy to this day, and most people enjoying this title won't be computer-savvy enough to iron out some of the fixes possible. However, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fantastic open-world adventure set within the confines of Russias' ""Exclusion Zone"".			"

												Here is my first Review of the game un-modded, well, even the Steam version of this game technically isn't actually un-modded, I checked the files & there was a mod file containing the contents of The Zone Reclamation Project Mod, to which should not be of anyone's worries as the mod is stable, changes nothing, & only fixes bugs, so for those of you new Rookies to The Zone worries about bugs, don't be, the game was mostly stable through out the game, anyways, onto the actual review, I gotta say, I love the hell out of this game, it may have been a bit rushed when it was first released, but now I consider it a masterpiece in my opinion for a plethera of many reasons,One - The Atmosphere: The atmosphere is probably the most affective post apocalypse atmosphere's I've experienced, with Fallout 3 & METRO 2033 Redux alongside it, whether if it is night or day, you'll hear noises of mutants ahead of you reminding that wherever you are in the zone, you are not alone, that, & the gunshots sounding off in the backround at random times.Two - The Intruiging Story & Setting: The lore itself is a bit obscure & odd as it is LOOSELY based off of the two science fiction novel's STALKER & Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky in the 1970s, to which STALKER got a film in 1979 (To which is on YouTube for free with translated subs, I recommend it), but like METRO 2033 & METRO: Last Light both being based on books, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. isn't very accurate which is fine & all that as the original STALKER story ivolved aliens, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl however is very different with a story involving a very strange change in story later on in the game to which I will not spoil as you should find it out on your own, but it is very interesting to say the least if you can handle obscure stories like the original STALKER story/film, or Prometheus, as for the setting, to easily explain it, years after the events of the real Ukraine, Chernobyl meltdown, in this alternate history story, the meltdown spreaded out further than it should have, creating a bigger wasteland with people nicknaming it ""The Zone"" to which a emission which is basically a storm/powerful release excess of noosphere energy from the center of The Zone, but after this Emission occurred, this phenomena itself called Anomalies appeared across The Zone, what are anomalies? No one can really explain, they are random bursts of energy of many types, a vortex that pulls anyone into it before exploding, a portal that teleports you to a random area, a weird forcefield that shoots out a shockwave at you when you get too close, yeah, this game gets very strange, & as this phenomena occurred, they created these odd objects of many shapes & textues, called ""Artifacts"" Which held many powers, & can be used as a gameplay mechanic, for example, one such artifact can give you better strength to hold your supplies, or to make your skin harder so bullets can't easily penetrate, so STALKERS, which if you don't know is actually an acronym for ""Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers, & Robbers"" began trespassing into The Zone to take & trade these artifacts while the Military tries to stop this operation, as all this happened, there are scientists finding out the Phenomena behind The Zone.Three - Gameplay & Mechanics: If you know Fallout, you'll probably say ""Hey! This looks exactly like Fallout!"" Well, this game came before Fallout, not just that, it doesn't include an RPG system, but it does include some RPG-ish elements as I mentioned before with the artifacts holding capabilities to give you stuff like ""5+ Resistance Against Fire"", not just that, this game is more tactical & actually based around a more survival/realistic turn of events, well, the vanilla game isn't exactly realistic survival like DayZ, but you can look out for mods that can make it realistic, but that is up to the player whether you want a realistic experience or not, you take in heavy damage from bullets, you can take in bleeding from getting clawed by a mutated beast, & you can get radiation poisoning badly, so it's not much of Fallout 3 & more like METRO 2033 Meets DayZ, also, how is the shooting itself? Some are mixed towards this, me personally, I found my experience fine, the hit detection doesn't seem off, the guns themselves feel balances, but one thing I can say is the first few missions aren't that great & may turn off some first time players, as you are given some weak weapons & immediately shoved into a gun fight mission, but as you learn how to be a STALKER you'll get the hang of it & master the game as I did.OVERALL FINAL VERDICT:This game isn't exactly for everyone, but I do consider this a MUST-TRY game, Must-Try as in if you don't like your first experience you should try it again to see if you can adapt & like the game, as for Survival Game fans, this is a Must-Buy, as this is probably your Chernobyl Disaster fantasy you've been waiting to delve into.FINAL SCORE: 8/10 ONLY MODDED WITH THE ZONE RECLAMATION PROJECT WHICH IS ALREADY INCLUDED WITH STEAM PURCHASE			"

This is definitely somewhere in my top of the list for games that have made make sounds in shock, because that's how much I jumped in my seat. Yes, this game is deceiving at first, but after diving into it you'll soon find that an eerie game lies beneath the surface of radition and gruff Russian mercenaries.Many different endings, and a great story with lore to back it up.Plays best in your first playthrough with ""Complete 2009"" mod.

												First and foremost, because I would like to point this out first, because most of the people reading this probably will not want to read the whole massive explanation as to why I like this game. So to summarize, first, this game is an incredibly excellent game that suffers from some bugs and semi-regular crashes, but you can get unoffical patches and mods that help fix that a little bit. I gotta point out though, this game can potentially be balls-to-the-wall hard. So... Expect to play this game methodically, and not rushing through Call of Duty style hoping you won't get hosed down will bullets or surrounded by mutants and mauled to death. Because, spoiler alert, you will. And now, on to the big explanation!S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a game ahead of its time. Running off of a system where you need to conserve bullets, monitor your weapons' and armor's conditions, and be very conservative with materials. All of this is mostly thanks to the weight system. In most games that incorporate a weight system, like Elder Scrolls titles and Fallout games, ammunition (Usually) weighs nothing. Not in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., no, in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., bullets weigh a devent amount. So this brings an interesting system to the fore. In most games, I would have main firearms, one as my preferred gun, and the other as my backup, and load up on ammo for both of those. You can do that in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., but it's not optimal. Rather, you should probably just load up on ammo for your main weapons (Pistol and assault weapon), otherwise you'll be over-encumbered.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. also has a bleeding system. If you get shot in a non-vital spot, you bleed, and you should bandage up or you're gonna slowly bleed out. If it's a lesser wound, you don't need to worry about it, it won't bleed much. It's color coded, if it's red, you'll bleed out if you don't treat it, if it's green, it'll most likely heal in a moment or two. If it's yellow, it'll heal, it will just take a while, and you're probably better off bandaging it. This is the first game (Regarding it's time of release, in 2007) that I have seen a game make the bleeding system pertain to enemy AI as well. You hit and enemy with a few shots to the chest, he'll probably either die in a few moments, or curl up on the ground and eventually die like that. It's still very impressive.Everything about the weapons, armor, and gameplay, generally is extremely impressive. But that doesn't mean I don't have my gripes with the game. There are a few problems: A: this game can be buggy as ♥♥♥♥. F6 oddly is the default quick save button. I set it to F5, becuase that's what it is in most games. That button is your friend. Use it a lot.B: I feel that a lot of the mutants take waaaaaaaay too mant rounds to put down. Unless you manage to hit them in the head, which is hard. Hell, even the blind dogs take like, at least a clip and a half from my Vintar BC to drop if I don't hit them in theh ead. There's a point where it starts to feel ridiculous, considering that this game pretty much forces you to ration off your ammo supplies.C: This game has an INSANE difficulty jump at the end of the game. It would be fine, if it didn't break all the rules that this game makes you obey. It forces you to move fast, and to act fast, while not dying. Up until that point, you essentially have to take everything slow and planned out. This ending just... It threw me off.---- Quick save is your friend. Remember this. ----Anyway, altogether, this game is awesome. There's a whole lot to do in it, between the warring factions, Duty and Freedom, and the side missions, there's a surprising lot to do. I would strongly suggest picking this game up if you haven't yet, and pick upt the STALKER: Complete mod for Shadow of Chernobyl. Makes it look a lot better, and tends to fix a lot of the issues the game has.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played, simply due to the such realistic and heart destroying atmoshpere that is presnt within the game. Its inventory system is good and unique to the player as well as a vast array of weapons to choose from. The A-Life system within this game although old is still a masterpiece with animals and mutants behaving as they should and would if it were real life. The maps are really detailed, although on the ageing X-Ray Engine, graphics are still pretty good.The storyline within the game is accurate and very interesting as you ponder Chernobyl and Pripyats secrets.All S.T.A.L.K.E.R games to-date are equally brilliant and follow on from each other spectacularly.With supported mods such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R complete 2012, bugs are taken care of and lighting, textures as well as A.I behaviour are greatly improved although I reccomend doign a run through in vanilla first!If you could get a perfect game, in my view, this is it; which is why I was heart-broken when I heard S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 was cancelled!10/10 would get jumpscared by a bloodsucker again!

												Strongly recommended.I first bought the game media DVD days after it was relased and reached my region... however, due to various reasons, I could not play it until now... those reasons were mainly language barrier (not native English, or good English at that time), so I could not understand much of the game back then... also my first encounter of the bloodsucker :D it made me jump on my seat... (I'll never forget that moment :D), so I thought: this is not the right time to play this game...I kept it in the shelve collecting dust, ignoring it, and I thought I wasted my money on it...Now, I got it on steam, and finally I could understand English well, so I thought, why not give it a try and see what is this game really is?I installed the 3 games, and started with SoC 2 weeks ago, and I just finished it...This game is now my number one game and I loved every single moment of it while I was playing... I lived with the main character through every single corner and place of it, and I will not forget my time playing this game...I will replay it, and I will make different choices through the game, again and again... I will not get bored of it I'm sure of this...This game has everything, RPG (of course), action, horror, mysteries, stealth and sneaking, and even some drama...This series (the 3 games Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat), made me feel really sad for that there will be no STALKER II of it... and I really hope that a day will come and I see this got a ""II"" after its name...I definately recommend this to every single gamer who want adventure and all types of game play mixed in 1 game...This should get more hype and more known over some ""big"" titles out there.

												Stalker may be the crown-jewel of Slavic post-apocalyptic games, surpassing even Metro 2033. With beautiful environments, a haunting ambient soundtrack, and vicious monsters, Stalker sets a dark tone for this survival-horror shooter. However, you will find that, unlike Metro 2033, humans play as great as threat as the monsters, perhaps even more so depending on how you play. With dozens of weapons, quests, and characters, you will be well prepared to discover all of Chernobyl's secrets. What is more, compared to Western post-apocalyptic games such as Fallout, Stalker possesses a much deeper and more intense story, especially towards the end, when the truth is revealed. Normally I would never recommend mods for a game, but in this case, I believe that Stalker Complete is well worth it, removing/fixing multiple glitches, and thus contributing to a smoother game. Overall, despite the savage nature of the environment, one cannot help but be impressed with how beautifully the developers strung together the story and characters. Overall Score: 10/10			"

												Technically an awesome game, with solid RPG mechanics, great atmosphere and actual open-world commodities like being able to get great stuff right off the bat, if you know what you're doing. Marred, maimed, crippled, by the fact it is a quick-load simulator. Most fights for the first 2-3 hours of gameplay consist of shooting at the heads of enemies in iron-sights, getting a kill, quick-saving, then trying that again for the other five guys in the area. Trying about 2-5 times per dude.Seriously, I've ambushed, done iron-sight head shots just to miss 3 times and then proceed to get wreckt immediately after. I'm giving this game the thumbs up, because I have gotten pretty far into it, once, and had some spooky times and good combat,but can't stand sitting down to play my game of the day just to find myself just hitting F8 every thirty seconds.

												I wish I had the box so I could ♥♥♥♥ing burn it. I'm not saying it's all bad, but man, it will frustrate you. You're basically a ♥♥♥♥ing postman for most of the game, buuut you can't carry much. Oh, and all those working vehicles? Can't drive em, even though the cut scene SHOWS YOU DRIVING. But no, you can't do that. So, the first time you drag a corpse filled with guns and ammo and junk to sell so you can get some decent armour is fun enough. The second is a drag and you'll likely never do it again. The weight limit is a burden on your ♥♥♥♥ing life, and not just ingame life, I am talking your life. Your time. You are forced to carry a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ that you will need. Like, you know, guns, ammo, body armour. All that ♥♥♥♥ comes to about 34kg. But oh, you want some medkits, bandages, food and vodka (you need it) well that ♥♥♥♥ weighs 10-15kg. I spent most of the game at 45kg, constantly worrying how I'll maintain my stamina for a gun fight or to run back to finish a mission. Then I finally got it right at 34kg. How's the combat? The AI is ♥♥♥♥ing good but your weapons are ♥♥♥♥ and poorly accurate. You'll die a lot. Headshots are the way to go, but even on Stalker difficulty, the enemy are far more accurate than you are and will waste you. You think this place is not populated? You're wrong. For a radiated hell zone there sure are a lot of people around and a lot of them want you dead. Too many humans, too many damn mutant dogs and not enough actual mutants. I had fun with this game for a couple of days but I can't ♥♥♥♥ing stand it anymore. Worth checking out if you like hard games or think you're hardcore. I'd recommend it only to see what it's about and let you make up your own mind. Maybe with some mods it will come to life but I don't have time to ♥♥♥♥ myself with barbed wire.			"

												NOTICE: This review is on the original (vanilla) version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. which excludes all mods. ==================Editorial Notes: One of by far the best FPS/RPG games I've ever own, was at first a little hesitant about this style. It has very odd controls and the AI is a laughable joke at easy settings but get incredibly difficult in harder/master difficulty (learn to duck and run when they reload). I'll be straight honest it is by far one of my favorite games to play when you have time to kill, just the missions alone can spend roughly 10+ hours if you really go above and beyond the beaten path and investigate nearly everything possible. A few Easter eggs can be found which I thought was rather clever but more importantly is the factions that act as you biggest pain the butt but the source of your jobs as a murderous psychopath. Each time I replay my game I try to use a different weapon that I rarely use, or a subset of weapons that I deemed unworthy to best myself and train in the hardest way possible (i.e. take a pistol or knife and kill a: snork, bloodsucker, any military officer) and even getting semi-creative with the use of surroundings.I will admit that the AI is very old and outdated meaning that they go by the line-of-sight controls. If they see an enemy they'll attack via line-of-sight and will gain a foothold by literally going straight even if that means going into a: fireplace, anomaly, or direct line of friendly fire (which in return get mad at you). AI also have two settings for accuracy, either they trained in the clone troopers training base or became solid-snake that trained with Agent 47's agency which ultimately depends on the difficulty you have it set to. Word of advice, rely solely on F6 && F7 your two newly formed friends of the trade.Pros: + Fun and interesting gameplay that stands against older games+ Can be rather challenging even during a 'weapon-free' zone; certain missions can leave you with an complex scenario where you can either go in guns blazing like Rambo or be like Sam Fisher and sneak your way in.+ Able to 'peak' around corners for some very unique firefights, AI can also assist in firefights (just watch for friendly-fire).+ Certain areas/zones have eerie soundtracks that even to this creation of this review, has a creepy factor that makes you watch your back.+ Open world; once you have certain missions completed or can pay off the right people.+ Different factions can ultimately change the gameplay; each having their own perks respectfully. (Duty = weapons, Freedom = Armor, STALKER = 'Monay Monay Monay....who needed Monay?')+ Semi-stealth; there is a stealth factor to the game as in if its dark enough enemies will have a harder time detecting you while you sneak. Whereas if you were to walk into a bush everyone including their mother will hear you thus alerting them to your presence. [Silence weapons are silent, if you get a kill it will be a silent unless they had line-of-sight on that target].Cons:- AI; as said before they will follow the path of the least resistance, even if that means walking into a anomaly or your line of fire. Some AI are even clueless as to where to go sometimes and will watch your movement until nearly everyone is dead in that area or they'll aimbot the next available unit even if its behind walls.- Controls; some of the controls are a little wonky. To access your PDA, press P. To check status of active task, press TAB. To go nearly prone, press CTRL + Shift (whilst using WASD and peaking corners). Some of the motions are a little clumsy, especially when getting shot at and needing to heal but fear that the moment you let go of the mouse you will literally run smack-dab into a bandit.- Difficulty; Can be easy as pie one minute then the next you are in the middle of one heck of a firefight with no clear visual of where that sniper is and ""BAM"" you see the text ""You Are Dead"" in harder settings. The harder you go the more accurate the enemy becomes, thus meaning that AK's can quite literally kill you in 2-3 hits even with a SEVA/Exoskeleton suit. - Buggy/Glitchy; Like most games there are bugs, but this game has quite a number of them (most are actually funny to see and do not really hinder the game performance). Situations such as side-missions can be tedious especially when you have to attack a group of military outside of Agroprom Research Institute by the zone load area and one of the military officers goes way behind the loading zone thus you cannot kill them but they can attack you. Certain areas have a weird NPC spawn area (wild territories) where friends or foe can literally spawn above you. Some of the more funnier glitches is using an explosive barrel near NPC's and watch them run into the fireplace and die.- Loading Areas; certain areas will have a 'loading' area to render the next part of the game. This can be very annoying when being chased and you 'load' into the next area but since you ran before the load you will waste your entire stamina and now your character cannot run away from what was hunting you down (i.e. running from the dogs in the bar area) You can theoretically bypass a few of them by going into a different part of the world but does not work for all.- Stealth; Like I said before there is a stealth factor but its very odd. You have to get a kill with a silent weapon (guns with silencer or a knife) whist being undetected or seen from an enemy. You have a visual bar that will show if you've been seen but it doesn't work part of the time, long distance firefights are the way to go if stealth is the objective.==================Conclusion: I really love this game with a passion! Even though that it was outdated and old, and a clumsy control but it rivals with Call of Pripyat and in general is a lot of fun to explore the different options that you couldn't do the game before. It's a fun game to have if you like FPS/RPG games and is by far one game that I love to use with mods (L.U.R.K. and the complete pack are fun to use). The replay ability is unheard of because you can replay the game but different NPC's will be used in different areas so where enemies might be wont spawn there till later or earlier in game, it has a random factor that always makes it more fun to snipe people out in full stealth and watch them squirm in their boots. Score: 8.5/10TL;DR version:* Wake up in room with bald guy while maintaining coolness factor.* Get gun from dead guy's body, wipe blood off face, stroke knife like a psychopath.* Run into military outpost, kill everyone with worst pistol in-game.* Shoot blind dog in face with AK-47, watch it skimper away as it holds hind leg up.* Almost shoot friend thinking was a bandit, shot them anyway, stole loot and ran off before their friends arrived.* Peek around corner in bar, greeted ""I said don't just stand there, come in"" multiple times.* Get told to ""get out of here stalker"", joined the Ukrainian-gladiator arena for money.* Peek around boxes in arena, see enemy stalker at end of arena.* Sneak up like Sam Fisher to enemy.* Peak around another boxes to spot enemy stalker, walks out in front of me, shoots my face.* You are dead, cry as i didn't quicksave.Would replay to crap my pants and get shot in face again. 10/10 "

												Technically an awesome game, with solid RPG mechanics, great atmosphere and actual open-world commodities like being able to get great stuff right off the bat, if you know what you're doing. Marred, maimed, crippled, by the fact it is a quick-load simulator. Most fights for the first 2-3 hours of gameplay consist of shooting at the heads of enemies in iron-sights, getting a kill, quick-saving, then trying that again for the other five guys in the area. Trying about 2-5 times per dude.Seriously, I've ambushed, done iron-sight head shots just to miss 3 times and then proceed to get wreckt immediately after. I'm giving this game the thumbs up, because I have gotten pretty far into it, once, and had some spooky times and good combat,but can't stand sitting down to play my game of the day just to find myself just hitting F8 every thirty seconds.

												Here is my first Review of the game un-modded, well, even the Steam version of this game technically isn't actually un-modded, I checked the files & there was a mod file containing the contents of The Zone Reclamation Project Mod, to which should not be of anyone's worries as the mod is stable, changes nothing, & only fixes bugs, so for those of you new Rookies to The Zone worries about bugs, don't be, the game was mostly stable through out the game, anyways, onto the actual review, I gotta say, I love the hell out of this game, it may have been a bit rushed when it was first released, but now I consider it a masterpiece in my opinion for a plethera of many reasons,One - The Atmosphere: The atmosphere is probably the most affective post apocalypse atmosphere's I've experienced, with Fallout 3 & METRO 2033 Redux alongside it, whether if it is night or day, you'll hear noises of mutants ahead of you reminding that wherever you are in the zone, you are not alone, that, & the gunshots sounding off in the backround at random times.Two - The Intruiging Story & Setting: The lore itself is a bit obscure & odd as it is LOOSELY based off of the two science fiction novel's STALKER & Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky in the 1970s, to which STALKER got a film in 1979 (To which is on YouTube for free with translated subs, I recommend it), but like METRO 2033 & METRO: Last Light both being based on books, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. isn't very accurate which is fine & all that as the original STALKER story ivolved aliens, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl however is very different with a story involving a very strange change in story later on in the game to which I will not spoil as you should find it out on your own, but it is very interesting to say the least if you can handle obscure stories like the original STALKER story/film, or Prometheus, as for the setting, to easily explain it, years after the events of the real Ukraine, Chernobyl meltdown, in this alternate history story, the meltdown spreaded out further than it should have, creating a bigger wasteland with people nicknaming it ""The Zone"" to which a emission which is basically a storm/powerful release excess of noosphere energy from the center of The Zone, but after this Emission occurred, this phenomena itself called Anomalies appeared across The Zone, what are anomalies? No one can really explain, they are random bursts of energy of many types, a vortex that pulls anyone into it before exploding, a portal that teleports you to a random area, a weird forcefield that shoots out a shockwave at you when you get too close, yeah, this game gets very strange, & as this phenomena occurred, they created these odd objects of many shapes & textues, called ""Artifacts"" Which held many powers, & can be used as a gameplay mechanic, for example, one such artifact can give you better strength to hold your supplies, or to make your skin harder so bullets can't easily penetrate, so STALKERS, which if you don't know is actually an acronym for ""Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers, & Robbers"" began trespassing into The Zone to take & trade these artifacts while the Military tries to stop this operation, as all this happened, there are scientists finding out the Phenomena behind The Zone.Three - Gameplay & Mechanics: If you know Fallout, you'll probably say ""Hey! This looks exactly like Fallout!"" Well, this game came before Fallout, not just that, it doesn't include an RPG system, but it does include some RPG-ish elements as I mentioned before with the artifacts holding capabilities to give you stuff like ""5+ Resistance Against Fire"", not just that, this game is more tactical & actually based around a more survival/realistic turn of events, well, the vanilla game isn't exactly realistic survival like DayZ, but you can look out for mods that can make it realistic, but that is up to the player whether you want a realistic experience or not, you take in heavy damage from bullets, you can take in bleeding from getting clawed by a mutated beast, & you can get radiation poisoning badly, so it's not much of Fallout 3 & more like METRO 2033 Meets DayZ, also, how is the shooting itself? Some are mixed towards this, me personally, I found my experience fine, the hit detection doesn't seem off, the guns themselves feel balances, but one thing I can say is the first few missions aren't that great & may turn off some first time players, as you are given some weak weapons & immediately shoved into a gun fight mission, but as you learn how to be a STALKER you'll get the hang of it & master the game as I did.OVERALL FINAL VERDICT:This game isn't exactly for everyone, but I do consider this a MUST-TRY game, Must-Try as in if you don't like your first experience you should try it again to see if you can adapt & like the game, as for Survival Game fans, this is a Must-Buy, as this is probably your Chernobyl Disaster fantasy you've been waiting to delve into.FINAL SCORE: 8/10 ONLY MODDED WITH THE ZONE RECLAMATION PROJECT WHICH IS ALREADY INCLUDED WITH STEAM PURCHASE			"

												STALKER Chadow of Chernobyl is an unforgettable experience to say the very least. I'd encountered this game several years back after a friend let me borrow his copy and was, well, very very confused at first. STALKER is a very unforgiving game on it's normal difficulty, but this only adds to it's charm as you survive in what is known as the the zone, an area formed around the ruins of the CNPP outside of Pripyat. Anomolous events litter the landscape, taking one wrong step into an anomoly typically ends with your body being strewn about and a horrible death following. The gameplay feels aged and the graphics seams show a bit, but this is made up for more than enough with a fairly expansive if not ruthless environment to explore. But exploration is properly rewarded, where there's risk here, there's reward for checking the most nuanced spots and checking PDA's of fallen enemies for goodies adds onto the long treks back and forth between areas of the zone, but as said, the rewards are there behind the fog of radiation, anomolies and bandits.As for the story, a lot and I mean a lot can be missed. The story is hardly linear and with how the game plays, it's potentially possible to beat the game in a matter of hours. Due to either the games age of coding issues, the story triggers can potentially be broken, leaving some story content locked away. But out of the several times I've played through this game, this typically won't be much of an issue. If anything, you'd have to go out of your way to break the game. But the most important aspect of STALKER:SoC. The environment. The world you inhabit is a threat all around you, only a few truly safe places between anomolies, bandits, military, waring factions and brain scorching transmissions. Not to mention, as you get closer to the center of the zone, the threats only rise, as does the truth of the zone as your faced with adversity on all sides, between the greed of man and the nuanced secrets hidden behind layer upon layer of secrets and lies which form the gestalt of the what the zone truly is. The true prize of this STALKER:SoC is the experience. The only other games I've played which reflect a similar feel to STALKER are the two Metro games which, I guarentee if you enjoy STALKER you'll enjoy Metro and visa versa.Overall, STALKER is aged a bit but a fun and unforgettable experience. I had fun with it and I'm sure you will to. The price is more than worth it and if you catch this game on a sale, it's money well spent on a gem of a game.  "

												a really great game. Dated a little engine wise, but it doesn't hurt the experience.I liked clear sky's play through better. It's more difficult and has a more ""survival"" feel to it. This is a bit more guided but that makes it better for ""new"" to the series.  Prypiyat's engine is more refined, and visually more appealing. I like it's weapons systems the best.This game will really get you into it however. There is a lot here more modern games should learn. Weapon wear and tear, cost of even getting grazed (you have to replace or repair everything) value of what to carry, and a very good creepy, real world run down look.with modern pricing it's a steal. One doesn't even need to ""play"" this serious to ""win"" just explore. It's one of those games you can enjoy just hunting around in the wilds and seeing what's out there. I suggest it to anyone who likes RPG's OR FPS games. The stalker series has a certain charm to it many games just lack. It affects your soul a little. The visuals are very close to the real world, even with game limitations of the various engines. This gives you a scenery effect. It's similar to games like far cry 2 where one finds themselves climbing a spot just to see a sunrise, or hiking to an area just to see the way the sunand the fog dance across the valley.the emersion factor of the stalker series can and will change you as person if you let it.  It can remind you a lot about what is important in life, by reminding you to just look around you, see whats out there, and not try to ""Win"" as much as ""experience"" things.			"

												Surprisingly dated graphics, and a few sizable bugs, but, despite these, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is still an Acronym...And a decent Game. Scary in places, terrifying in others, and incredibly action-packed in the rest. Made of several, inter-connected Free-Roaming Environments, this Game has quite a few things to see and do. Lots of weapons and weapon accessories, with plenty of monsters and mutants to use them on, this game is quite fun. An engaging, open-ended storyline that'll pit you against your nightmares, mutants and the millitary, you'll have to be fast and smart to overcome the obstacles in your way...Oh, and it helps if you speak Russian-despite the best efforts of the game's designers, in-game NPCs shout out things in russian during combat, important things to. Also, in-game chat has numerous mis-translations: Attic and Basement are commonly mistranslated sending you to completly the wrong floor, etc. Despite these bugs, it's a game well-worth playing.

												I'm a sucker for post apocalyptic games / films and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. doesn't disappoint. The Russian zone has a fantastic, immersive and creepy atmosphere that really needs to be experienced to be appreciated. You get that wonder of what's around the next corner, what's in that ruined building or what's across that field of dead grass, but do you proceed or take a break? This game has a lot going for it... nice graphics, various quests, dynamic weather, night and day cycles, many weapons and mutated monsters, plus you can always have a shot of vodka. ;)  If you do buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R., there's a great mod that adds a lot to the whole experience called Stalker Complete (new textures, sounds music, bug fixes, AI fixes, ragdoll physics, etc...).

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R remains to be the only game that I play which has FPS combat, for a multitude of reasons. S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is an RPG set in the post-apocalyptic grounds of radiation-filled Chernobyl, where S.T.A.L.K.E.R's roam and reign in this wild west of mutants and Russians in gas masks. This oldie remains captivating to me because of this one, simple thing: It was crafted with care. Hell, the designers went INTO CHERNOBYL and modeled parts of the game after what they saw.Shadow of Chernobyl is a game built on atmosphere. Ho-lee ♥♥♥♥, atmosphere is extremely present. From the way the lighting is done, to the wind effects, to the echoes of mutated animals crying out in the fields, to the eerie trance of quiet music beneath the whoosh of wind blowing by you as you trek through a field, bleeding and tired from an encounter... It really feels like what the developpers intended, which is that you're struggling to survive in Chernobyl with what you can find. Without adding legitimate ""horror aspects,"" S.T.A.L.K.E.R developped a tinge of scariness with the excessive ammount of eerie that drives home the point it was going for. The combat engine is relatively simplistic, but it's satisfying. The damage frame makes cover actually necessary to outlast a longer fight, therefore making the lean function actually useful. The noise and visibility system added to the game also gives you the choice to go in stealthily or half-cocked, and also makes it that much more realistic; other people can HEAR YOU SNEAKING if you're sloppy, and wandering around with a flashlight will give away your position to anything that wants to kill you. Combine this system with angry russians, a gas mask, and some creepy torn up towns, and you've got S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Honestly, I'd pick this over Fallout any day of the week. I'd recommend this game to ANYONE. "

												Let everything that's been planned come true. Let them believe. And let them have a laugh at their passions. Because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy, but just the friction between their souls and the outside world. And most important, let them believe in themselves. Let them be helpless like children, because weakness is a great thing, and strength is nothing. When a man is just born, he is weak and flexible. When he dies, he is hard and insensitive. When a tree is growing, it's tender and pliant. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being. Because what has hardened will never win.			"

												A hidden classic of a game that has all sorts of quirks, but so much charm that you can't find in most modern games. It was developed by a now defunct Ukranian studio that hardly advertised their new IP, and became a cult classic. It's hardcore, it's buggy, it's slavic as all hell, and it is glorious.For the more intuitive PC gamer, the XRay Engine is highly moddable and the mod scene for STALKER is large and incredibly high quality. A vanilla playthrough is always recommended for first-timers, but subsequent playthroughs are much better with mods, as you appreciate what the mods change after experiencing the genuinely oh-so-lovely horrors of vanilla.Gunplay is fun, voice actors laughably bad, and the story is surprisingly good with bits of lore from books, science fiction, and even inspirations from the real life Exclusion Zone. One of my most favorite games of all time with incredible replayability and modding potentional, and an early example of an indie game before indie games were the fad of the day. STALKER is not for everyone, and takes a special kind of mindset to love, but for those that connect with it, nothing else compares. It is a game of legend. Buy it and immerse yourself in the Cheeki Breeki. "

												Kind of a blend of the old and new Fallout games, with a grittier, scaryier, and more difficult world.I warn you, this game may be frustratingly difficult sometimes in the early game. It takes some time to learn how to do well. And getting some better weapons helps too. That said, use cover. Aim for the head, or legs as most humans wear body armor of some kind. Body shots are next to worthless. Once you get used to how to survive and fight effectvely, the game really takes off. The setting is grim in a way that reminds me a lot of metro, and the isometric fallouts. The lore and information introduced in the game's encyclepedia is not only interesting but vitally useful as well. This is the ONLY game I've ever played where reading the ingame lore compendium or encyclepedia entries as they unlock is rewarding! Enemies are challenging and frighteing, especially when you encounter new mutants that you don't know much about. You have to be aware of your environment when fighting so you don't back-pedal into a lethal anomaly or radiation patch.Only 10 is hours in but I am loving the adventure of this game. It has kind of an old style charm, like morrowind, but is very viable as a modern game.			"

												When someone asks ""which is the best FPS you've ever played?"" It's a difficult question to answer, but I can easily that STALKER SOC is the best FPS I've played in the last 10 years. The RPG elements, inventory management and the sandbox environment add a lot of depth to the game and the atmosphere is just brilliant. The exclusion zone is beautifully created and the bleak atmosphere is captured well. There are plenty of weapons, not weapons different because of stats but different unique weapons that can be modified with a scope or a grenade launcher. Artifacts can be collected and used for additional stats like protection against radation or bullets.      ""You kill two blood suckers and your health is down and the screen stars to swim and that moment of dread when you realise that a controller is nearby!"" that's horror!      I'm playing the Pripyat mission in the night looking for the secret lab and it was so brilliant that I had to pause the game and come here to write a review.

												This is a copy of my metracritic review (I gave 10 out of 10):This game is a fps with a small rpg element and takes place in the 'Zone' around Chernobyl where you have to do missions to progress in the story.The opinion of this game is often black or white: many people love it while others hate it. In the beginning it took me also hours before I could understand the concept. I almost abandoned it before I started to like and love it. The graphics are ok but the atmosphere (e.g. weather, sounds, lighting in caves) is extraordinary. A good example is the first underground mission in Agroprom, which is spooky as hell. Some drawbacks are bugs and crashes, lack of transportation, difficult shooting (i.e. aim for the head and be prepared to get killed with 1 shot) and learning curve in the beginning.Despite its flaws I consider this is as the best game of the past 10 year.

												Whoever praises Fallout 3 and New Vegas, should have firstly played this game.I'm not saying this game is better than Fallout 3, I'm just saying that this title is the real post-apocalyptic FPS experience.So many years have passed and now I've played this game also on Steam, and I must say that even if time passes by, this game never gets old.Let's start with the main point of this game: gameplay.Not considering the RPG style inventory and quest system, the ballistic of weapons is something you don't see often so well made in an FPS.After handling well a weapon, you acquire the skill to use it right, and every weapon feels different.Enemy's AI is another great point in favor: they always know how to catch you the right way, disregarding of the place, and their movements are always smart and unpredictable.I think this AI is smartest than F.E.A.R.'s one, and probably the best I've ever seen in an FPS.Graphics are very good, even if a bit dated. The entire zones are fully explorable and they are wonderfully designed.Sounds of weapons feel like having a gun in your hand and when you get hit, you can feel it on your skin.The overall experience is something very unique considering standard FPS games on the market.For the bad part: the game lack most of the fundamental tweaks, like fast travelling (yeah, this is pretty boring, especially because enemies respawn), the possibility to repair your equipment, time limited side quests and a fixed and low limit for carriage (I know it's ""realistic"" that your character can carry just 50 Kg, but it's a videogame and it's boring).The very bad of this game is the plot [SPOILER ALLERT]:Yeah, there may be some cool moments and twists, but the story is pretty stupid (go there, then there, then I need you to take that and carry it on there...) and the only narrative value is the way it let you know the story behind the catastrophe, but as a character based story, it's not so interesting.Probably, the ending is the most disappointing thing of this game: almost all the endings have a pretty stupid horrifying theme and they really don't satisfy the great work that the player have been done to accomplish all of this.I think this is one of these games that should be definitely be played by every FPS lover, after Half-Life and F.E.A.R.

												STALKER Chadow of Chernobyl is an unforgettable experience to say the very least. I'd encountered this game several years back after a friend let me borrow his copy and was, well, very very confused at first. STALKER is a very unforgiving game on it's normal difficulty, but this only adds to it's charm as you survive in what is known as the the zone, an area formed around the ruins of the CNPP outside of Pripyat. Anomolous events litter the landscape, taking one wrong step into an anomoly typically ends with your body being strewn about and a horrible death following. The gameplay feels aged and the graphics seams show a bit, but this is made up for more than enough with a fairly expansive if not ruthless environment to explore. But exploration is properly rewarded, where there's risk here, there's reward for checking the most nuanced spots and checking PDA's of fallen enemies for goodies adds onto the long treks back and forth between areas of the zone, but as said, the rewards are there behind the fog of radiation, anomolies and bandits.As for the story, a lot and I mean a lot can be missed. The story is hardly linear and with how the game plays, it's potentially possible to beat the game in a matter of hours. Due to either the games age of coding issues, the story triggers can potentially be broken, leaving some story content locked away. But out of the several times I've played through this game, this typically won't be much of an issue. If anything, you'd have to go out of your way to break the game. But the most important aspect of STALKER:SoC. The environment. The world you inhabit is a threat all around you, only a few truly safe places between anomolies, bandits, military, waring factions and brain scorching transmissions. Not to mention, as you get closer to the center of the zone, the threats only rise, as does the truth of the zone as your faced with adversity on all sides, between the greed of man and the nuanced secrets hidden behind layer upon layer of secrets and lies which form the gestalt of the what the zone truly is. The true prize of this STALKER:SoC is the experience. The only other games I've played which reflect a similar feel to STALKER are the two Metro games which, I guarentee if you enjoy STALKER you'll enjoy Metro and visa versa.Overall, STALKER is aged a bit but a fun and unforgettable experience. I had fun with it and I'm sure you will to. The price is more than worth it and if you catch this game on a sale, it's money well spent on a gem of a game.  "

												Stalker, first and foremost is an older game at this time, Hailing from 2007, this game can easily be played to its full graphical potential on even the lower end gaming computers, as it runs near flawlessly on mine. The combat is as fluent throughout the game, as it is realistic. Your character will succumb after only a few hits or shots, even on the ""normal"" difficulty or, ""Stalker"". (Novice, Stalker, Veteran, Master) Scavenging for items is nice, searching dead bodies and even being able to drag them as to not alert others, weapons perform realisticly as one cannot pull headshots with pistols or shotguns no problem, and the recoil and reload animations are very nice. Theres a trading system also, which allows practically any friendly person to be a potential purveyor of goods ranging from food, weapons, ammo, and other various necessary gear items, allowing yoiu to trade off found weapons and such or even buy new ones with the money provided, It is first person, has a nice open world feel to it as you can accomplish objectives and side missons from however angle you please, but also requires the patience of a saint to play. Ive died an innumerable amount of times in the first two hours of gameplay, being too gung-ho or  trying to be that guy that rambos the entire russian federation. plus these ""anomalies"" encountered are THE biggest pain. imagine an invisable enemy that you cant kill. that just repeatedly attacks you when you get in its proximity. this is ""fixed"" by providing the player with not only the ability to see the dust these things kick up, but an infinite amount of bolts that youre just lugging around. This game, all in all, is solid and promising. i do hope to enjoy it.PROS-Realism of firefights, weapon handling, and environment-creepy as hell creatures, mutants and such-plenty of weapons/gear-sound effects are nice-still eye pleasing even after all this time-Weather/time of day changes(think, Metro 2033/Fallout before they were big)CONS-Dead bodies too ragdoll-y at times-frustrating ""trial and error"" combat-no auto save...?-even the normal difficulty is still hard-controls are a bit fumbly			"

Cheeki breeki/10.On serious note,while being unoptimized for multi-core CPU (it only uses one core), several bugs here and there, and sometimes will crash when you put too much addons to it, this game is a very fine game.

												Perhaps my favorite PC game as of this writing (and 4th favorite game of all time!), Shadow of Chernobyl crafts a world where terror and violence lurks in the irradiated grasslands and the seemingly-empty shells of civilization that make up the Exclusion Zone. With its consistently bleak atmosphere, minimalist sound design, and horrifying monsters, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:SoC has given me more lasting nightmares and sudden screams than other games that actually try really hard to scare you. Players who persevere through the initially high learning curve and generally bug-riddled nature of Eastern European games will find that SoC isn’t a mere FPS with RPG elements, but a whole new experience in its own right.

												This game is awesome!! It is like a mature, more serious version of Fallout (though admittedly not as intricate, it's not really an RPG at all). The biggest point in this games favour is the immersion. After an hour I really got wrapped up in the whole world here. It really makes you feel like a loner in a desolate land where everyone is struggling by against bizarre and mysterious forces. Even little things like... hearing the distant cries of animals, the sounds of gun fights somewhere far off, a group of survivors just sitting around the campfire, chatting and playing guitar. It really adds to the immersion!The missions are somewhat varied. You don't feel bored really. Some missions (in the labs) are really some of the best ever, giving a feeling of survival horror or like the Shalebridge Crade from Thief 3. The locations are all memorable and no two are comparable. The gun play is decent enough though you can get killed pretty easily so this requires much more caution. There's some good chances to customize your load out (though not to Fallout levels).As for negatives... it could use a fast travel system like Skyrim. The map is huge and some missions mean travelling one side to the other regularly. Also, in a game where immersion is so evident I'd have expected to do more reading/listening to reports and notes left by other survivors. Some people hate that but I think in this game, if well done, really would've added to it.NOTE: there is also a big modding community for this game. Search for the Stalker Complete series. There is a ""Complete"" mod for each Stalker game. I am currently playing the vanilla version and it plays fine but have a look at the mod. "

												Kind of a blend of the old and new Fallout games, with a grittier, scaryier, and more difficult world.I warn you, this game may be frustratingly difficult sometimes in the early game. It takes some time to learn how to do well. And getting some better weapons helps too. That said, use cover. Aim for the head, or legs as most humans wear body armor of some kind. Body shots are next to worthless. Once you get used to how to survive and fight effectvely, the game really takes off. The setting is grim in a way that reminds me a lot of metro, and the isometric fallouts. The lore and information introduced in the game's encyclepedia is not only interesting but vitally useful as well. This is the ONLY game I've ever played where reading the ingame lore compendium or encyclepedia entries as they unlock is rewarding! Enemies are challenging and frighteing, especially when you encounter new mutants that you don't know much about. You have to be aware of your environment when fighting so you don't back-pedal into a lethal anomaly or radiation patch.Only 10 is hours in but I am loving the adventure of this game. It has kind of an old style charm, like morrowind, but is very viable as a modern game.			"

												I absolutely adore this game. For whatever reason it was one of my earliest Steam purchases, and really set a precedent for me. I'm probably one of the few people left that plays this game without mods/vanilla, and I'm always hesitant to install them. This game was my Dark Souls many years earlier. It is brutal and unforgiving and really takes an understanding of what is happening around you so that you can eventually feel like you are actually a powerful force in the world you inhabit and deserve to be as such. Hauntingly beatiful and deathly terrifying, I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys difficult atmospheric shooters (think early Metro 2033/Last Light with more outdoors settings). It has been a long time since I've had to learn and pay attention as much in a game as in this one, and I'll forever revel in it as it holds a special place in my heart. The following games advance in different directions but still afford notice, I've only played its prequel and not the sequel so I can't make particular recommendations there. If you like what you've heard here, and want to pick up an extremely interesting game that it would be hard to spend more than $20 on, heed my advice and go for it8/10			"

												It's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl and it's one of the best first person shooters of all time. This game has it all with the rough characters that are earthy and simple, the huge amount of inventory that's available and of course don't bring back everything you can to the trader for extra cash because you're simply going to have a huge pile of gear in the ship or near your locker and then the game slows down because you brought back thousands of extra handguns, knives, ammo and whatever and then tossed them in the corner. If you do that then spread them around outside because the game get's unstable with thousands of weapons and stuff tossed in the corner of a room. Trust me you don't want to do that because the game doesn't like it but otherwise this game is solid, fun, kewl, awesome and it gets very creepy, moody, spooky and full of pressure and tight suspense. There's a lot to risk and a lot to think about and the more you play the more you want to play more. This game needs the mods from MODdb and after that you're set and ready to play. The MODS there will stabilize the game, tweak the graphics, add some gear and make everything operate better and more stable. Buy it because it's sooper and buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat too because it' simply awesome too. The other STALKER Clear Sky I've not played much and it seems different and so I didn't find the extra time because I have 48 shooter games ;) Buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat and buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl because these are the best in the series and both have great support at MODdb and you'll love the trippy weirdness of the game that is 100% a full on first person shooter experience with some really kewl other stuff to do too.

												One of the most atmospheric shooters, and holds itself well despite being way old.  Be sure to update the core game with Stalker Complete mods (cleans up most of the minor but annoying bugs from vanilla).  A game that challenges you to shoot straight and use cover; run & gun will only get you as far as the ""load game"" screen.  An environment that tries to intimidate and injure you throughout the game (and does a very fine job of it).  Turn down the lights, put on some good headphones and just absorb the atmosphere.  One of the few games that I played that I had an AN-94 with grenade launcher and scope, a desert eagle, an MP5, 6 grenades, 500 rounds of ammo, and I was STILL hesitant to leave a safe area in the dark.  A must-buy for any single player FPS fan.			"

												This game was way too hardz, even for a genius like me.  I run into buildings with all my Call of Duty skillz, shooting fast as I can, always goin for them headshots, but then I get plastered Clint Eastwood/Gran Torino-style.  WTF?!  I mean, I aimed right at that guy's head with my pistol from less than 200 virtual yards away, and not a single shot hit!!  And then they killed me in like 3 shots with an assault rifle!  What do they expect me to do, find cover?!?!  I thought this was America!  And geez, there are no womenz!  I ended up trying to pork a zombie.			"

												The word that can best describe this game is 'gritty'.I've beat it twice now, which makes me barely an amateur. The first time I didn't invest into the story and barely scrapped by the (suddenly very difficult) end game area. I didn't see it much more than an FPS with more stats to worry about, so I uninstalled it.Years later I gave it another try, but instead invested more into the story and gameplay, and I ended up really liking what the game did offer. STALKER definitely offers a unique 'gritty' experience that many other games won't ever aim for. Its a neat cross between something you would see in a more realistic tactical shooter, but has some of the exploration elements that you would see in more open-world games. Definitely worth checking out.			"

												Simply put STALKER is an atmospheric open-world first-person-shooter.As a larger whole it's also the finest PC gaming has to offer: it challenges you and doesn't hold your hand. It 's graphically impressive, yet can be scaled down to work on weaker machines. It's poorly executed at parts but the very ideas behind it were so ambitious that you have to like it just for trying. And it has a highly moddable and customizable structure.I most definitely recommend this to anyone interested in open-world shooting or post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Invest time looking into and installing mods to really get your moneys worth.			"

												I like to think of this game as a good replacement for sex. You can collect all different types of weapons with different accuracies, recoils, ammunition, and looks. There's no upgrading or repairing in this version, but mods will be able to change that. The atmosphere and environment is a harsh interpretation of nature and industrialized infrastructure crossing in unfortunate directions. Contrarywise, I'd advise not spending too much time here as just like for sex there's an intended consequence that gets overlooked and so unbalances the natural processes. For instance, increased instance of mental disorders and casual sex are correlated (maybe I'm the first to inform you), but luckily there's no correlation between killed AI and society here, at least because there's not much society.

It has a nice atmosphere, a lot of weapons to choose and the enemies are always a challenge, even on lower difficulties. This game has a TON of mods wich make the game itself even better with new missions, charachters, MOAR WEAPONS, even better atmosphere and new NPCs or completly new places to visit. It is in my opinion even a better game than Fallout 3 or New Vegas. I just love the feel when you go to a campfire at night and you see Stalkers talking or playing guitar.

												This game may not be for everyone. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. may seem dated when compared to modern shooters it does have what most lack, interesting mechanics  and immersion that you can really sink your teeth into. Can't really even say I've played anything else like it. The world of this game feels alive and really captures the hoplessness seems to permeate Russian fiction. This game, while not perfect, offers some of the most immersive moments I've ever hadA lot of people recomend going into this game modless but I have to disagree. Currently playing with autumn aurora 2 and it's amazing without sacrificing the original feel of the game.Pros:+ Immersion that is so deep, you could drown.+ Interesting locations and content+ Firefights are intense, especially if you have a gun that is prone to jamming.Cons:- Story can be ho hum at points- A.I. can be a little unfair at times- Difficulty spikes throughout the game (for the love of god bring lots of ammo)Overall:At the start of my second play through I ran away from a pack of dogs...into a military squadren. Dodging bullets, I sprinted back to the first HQ which started a firefight between the military and stalkers. I hid in an abondanded house, while a quest giving npc caught a bullet with his face and died. I failed the ""quests"" he gave me but I got to scavenge his body and took his guns and money. All of this was unscripted.9/Roadside Picnic would highly recommend.			"

												This Game Is definately worth $20. No other games i can think of (except for maybe the Metro series) can give as much atmosphere. It gives both a good post apocolyptic atmosphere, and a dark, scary atmosphere in the labs. The game is also notable for its refreshing level of difficulty, requiring you to be careful even on the easiest difficulty, but rewards you for playing smart. In addition to all this, the game also has a great mod community and   great selection of mods to enhance your gameplay, even going so far as to make it a whole different game, definately making the game very replayable.

												This game isn't for everyone, a quirky FPS with great atmosphere and a unique setting (it's probably been done to death since then, but this game was the first). It remains quirky to this day. It does not come across as a AAA title and there is a Stalker Complete mod which overhauls the game and fixes many things. So yeah you need to be a hardcore FPS gamer to get into this one. I re-installed it at least 3 times over the past 5-6 years to play through it again, originally i had a boxed copy and i bought the steam version when i couldnt find it anymore.

If you want to make it past an hours gametime, when you hear any doglike noise RUN THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY. They are the most powerful enemies in the game, including the soldiers.

The game feels scary to the surface, but the underground levels are truly the horror aspect of this game. In addition to all this, there are a lot of side quests that you can do and equipment to collect, so the replayability is really strong in this one.

The atmosphere outshines all the graphical problems. You'll be damned to experience the feeling of being back into society than when you arrive back to the bar after a long day hunting. The final run onto the CNPP and the 7 endings will challenge conventional FPS abities that have been dormant since the first Far Cry. The music, between MooZe's atmospheric score and Firelake's action music will set in more than just fear, proving this superior to an ordinary horror game. Thiis is Fallout 3 and the kictchen sink.

The atmosphere, the sound effects, the enemies all make this game feel a dynamic trip to the remains of Earth's worst nuclear disaster. However your weapons are like peashooters, and some of your enemies are ridiculously strong for example, in the sarcophagus of the reactor it feels like the Monolith are using anti-tank rounds because it's a near one shot kill for them..

Within an hour or starting I was completely hooked and couldn't pry myself away from the screen. The storyline,visuals, sound and most importantly atmosphere is like no other game I have encountered, and still hasnt been surpassed to this day. It is scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and heart racing, but never makes you feel completely helpless like all the survival horror games. It will most likely leave you clinging onto your mouse and keyboard for dear life.The freedom this game gives is also very rewarding. I am not a fan of linear shooters such as metro 2033, so if you like a bit of exploring this is the game for you.			"

												Stalker may be the crown-jewel of Slavic post-apocalyptic games, surpassing even Metro 2033. With beautiful environments, a haunting ambient soundtrack, and vicious monsters, Stalker sets a dark tone for this survival-horror shooter. However, you will find that, unlike Metro 2033, humans play as great as threat as the monsters, perhaps even more so depending on how you play. With dozens of weapons, quests, and characters, you will be well prepared to discover all of Chernobyl's secrets. What is more, compared to Western post-apocalyptic games such as Fallout, Stalker possesses a much deeper and more intense story, especially towards the end, when the truth is revealed. Normally I would never recommend mods for a game, but in this case, I believe that Stalker Complete is well worth it, removing/fixing multiple glitches, and thus contributing to a smoother game. Overall, despite the savage nature of the environment, one cannot help but be impressed with how beautifully the developers strung together the story and characters. Overall Score: 10/10			"

												The only game I can compare this to is Fallout, but I know that is wrong. Fallout does not come close to what Stalker presents. The level of immersion, not to mention paranoia is the best I have experienced in any game. Stalker feels like a more serious and realistic Fallout, meaning that survival is THE most important thing. You always need to keep your eyes open and your ears listening or you could end up walking into death. You never know who is enemy or friend. And don't get me started about the mutants...I would buy this game, as well as the other Stalker games, for every one of my friends if I could!Worth the purchase!			"

												Shadow of Chernobyl is a fun and expansive game set in ""The Zone"", an area of Ukraine that was directly affected by the Chernobyl Plant disaster. With that out of the way, I'd like to get down to why this game is so incredible. Atmosphere. You wont find a game that pulls you in and holds you there quite like a Stalker game. The game has a way of simply including you in the zone, making you feel as if every encounter is life or death and the moments in between are a sweet breath of fresh air. I tell you, there's nothing like coming in from the clustering darkness to an old railway station after fighting off hordes of obnoxiously intelligent (and I'm being serious, STALKER ai is frightening to fight against, and is rumored to be able to complete the game on their own) bandits to find a group of fellow Stalkers and rookies huddled around a trashcan fire, speaking softly in Russian, knowing in here, around friends, just for tonight- You're safe.Shootouts are frequent and heart pounding. It's recommended you play on Master difficulty with the crosshairs disabled. You and your target are likely to go down in a few hits. As I said before, the Ai is frighteningly intelligent. They will actively move towards you if they can, flanking and moving from cover to cover, plunking shots all the while. This makes choosing your cover very important, and forces you to keep a close eye on who your fighting with. All too often I've damn near ♥♥♥♥ myself because I let a bandit come up behind me while I was trading shots with a few of his buddies in a run down far. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oneself, The Zone is not only populated with bandits, but monsters as well, all of them designed and built around fear.STALKER is an RPG of sorts. You've got an inventory system, weight system, you need to eat every so often, there's an economy, weapons and armor to pick from, factions and reputation- It's got it all. Will I tell you it's done well? Not all of it. Don't expect to level up or pick our perks. That can somewhat be accomplished by recovering artifacts, but it's certainly not the same. Still, that's no reason to not check out the game. STALKER in the end is a fun and terrifying game, one that makes you feel like a rugged post-apocalyptic Ukranian artifact hunter and full time bandit/creature slayer. Shadow of Chernobyl comes highly recommended, and once you've done a vanilla play through, there's an abundance of mods to try out. Then go on to pick up CS and Call of Pripyat. Good hunting, Stalkers.			"

												OUTSTANDING Game. Dont expet this as an Call of duty game the gameplay is challenging, you dont always hit the enemies once you aim directly at 'em but its all about realism.This game is scary/spooky aswell once you're in a tunnel you'll regret going in. Once you hear a sound or even see something your heart will be pumping like ♥♥♥♥, and the feeling is amazing when you're getting scared.BUY IT!			"

												Nothing even comes close! this is as hardcore as free roam FPS's get! the story, atmospherics (oohhhh the atmospherics), the horror, the action, the stealth, the weapons (and how real they are), the suits, the creatures, the anomolies, the group dynamics... everything is perfect! EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE... EVERY DECISION... WILL AFFECT THE ENDING OF THE GAME... 12 different endings that is. Also, the sheer number of mods available for this game are nuts. the first mod you really should get is called 'complete' it just basically updates all the textures to a higher resolution and fixes a few other 2006ish issues.If i had to pick a con... just one tiny con... the lack of hand to hand combat. nope you dont get a knife, so if you run out of bullets, well then youre kinda screwed. but the chances of that happening are freakishly low though.

												Alright, this game for me would be a  9.5/10. This game is an immersive, free roam survival, and it does a damn good job at it. The storyline is one you can really wrap your head around. The gameplay throughout the story is intense action and fun at the same time. The game has a realistic fighting system with bleeding effects and radiation. There's also the mutants that you can fight with. If the story isn't good enough for you, there's tons of side missions and free roam exploration. You can even win favor from different factions in the game and get special weapons and suits from them only. The only problem is in this game you can't join factions and control them without mods. So if you like large free roam survival games, then get this.			"

												Mutant mayhemThe STALKER games have a reputation for being tough, and it’s well-deserved -- this is probably the most challenging single-player game I’ve played. Both the open world and the AI are very unforgiving. There are constant dangers not just from the wide variety of enemies but also from high levels of radiation and strange spatial anomalies. The Zone is a large place and during the course of the game you get to visit a diverse range of environments and encounter many weird malevolent forces. The combat is always demanding and requires a good deal of strategic thinking given that you have to deal with other health-depleting factors at the same time. The story, although it does suffer from the usual lack of focus as a result of non-linear gameplay and some uninspiring side quests, is still reasonably strong and engaging. Graphically it’s quite impressive, although I should point out that I installed the STALKER Complete 2009 mod from the get-go, which (as I understand it) improves on the vanilla game in this area. It’s true that there are some annoying bugs, but they didn’t dampen my enjoyment of the game too much. And even though the weapons and armour deteriorate (a feature I’m not overly fond of) the speed with which this occurs is more realistic than in many RPGs so it didn’t bug me too much. Overall the game scores very highly for its outstanding atmosphere, which is one of the most engrossing, and idiosyncratic, that I’ve encountered. Highly recommended. 4/5			"

												Like many, I came here from the YouTube Channel ""Life of Boris"" and personally, I love this game! The atmosphere, the sound effects, the enemies all make this game feel a dynamic trip to the remains of Earth's worst nuclear disaster. However your weapons are like peashooters, and some of your enemies are ridiculously strong for example, in the sarcophagus of the reactor it feels like the Monolith are using anti-tank rounds because it's a near one shot kill for them.. Overall this game is a masterpiece that has aged so well over the years, and I really enjoy playing this unique and engaging title and I hope gamers for generations to come recognise the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series for the amazing series it is.

There was 3-4 times before this when i wanted to play this game, but i wanted an Ultimate experiance of the Zone... and again..and again..So this time i have installed Shadow of Chernobyl, plus Complete 2009 mod, plus PRZ2 texture packs and overwritten the english audio files with the ukranian (ukranian are about 200mb while english is 75mb). Maybe few tiny mods along with this, and this was an ULTIMATE EXPERIANCE of the ZONE, i played this for 4 days . More than 30h. Твоё желание скоро исполнится. Иди ко мне.. I give it 90/100 (I had Good ending btw) "

												One of the best games I have ever played, simply due to the such realistic and heart destroying atmoshpere that is presnt within the game. Its inventory system is good and unique to the player as well as a vast array of weapons to choose from. The A-Life system within this game although old is still a masterpiece with animals and mutants behaving as they should and would if it were real life. The maps are really detailed, although on the ageing X-Ray Engine, graphics are still pretty good.The storyline within the game is accurate and very interesting as you ponder Chernobyl and Pripyats secrets.All S.T.A.L.K.E.R games to-date are equally brilliant and follow on from each other spectacularly.With supported mods such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R complete 2012, bugs are taken care of and lighting, textures as well as A.I behaviour are greatly improved although I reccomend doign a run through in vanilla first!If you could get a perfect game, in my view, this is it; which is why I was heart-broken when I heard S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 was cancelled!10/10 would get jumpscared by a bloodsucker again!

												Strongly recommended.I first bought the game media DVD days after it was relased and reached my region... however, due to various reasons, I could not play it until now... those reasons were mainly language barrier (not native English, or good English at that time), so I could not understand much of the game back then... also my first encounter of the bloodsucker :D it made me jump on my seat... (I'll never forget that moment :D), so I thought: this is not the right time to play this game...I kept it in the shelve collecting dust, ignoring it, and I thought I wasted my money on it...Now, I got it on steam, and finally I could understand English well, so I thought, why not give it a try and see what is this game really is?I installed the 3 games, and started with SoC 2 weeks ago, and I just finished it...This game is now my number one game and I loved every single moment of it while I was playing... I lived with the main character through every single corner and place of it, and I will not forget my time playing this game...I will replay it, and I will make different choices through the game, again and again... I will not get bored of it I'm sure of this...This game has everything, RPG (of course), action, horror, mysteries, stealth and sneaking, and even some drama...This series (the 3 games Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat), made me feel really sad for that there will be no STALKER II of it... and I really hope that a day will come and I see this got a ""II"" after its name...I definately recommend this to every single gamer who want adventure and all types of game play mixed in 1 game...This should get more hype and more known over some ""big"" titles out there.

												The word that can best describe this game is 'gritty'.I've beat it twice now, which makes me barely an amateur. The first time I didn't invest into the story and barely scrapped by the (suddenly very difficult) end game area. I didn't see it much more than an FPS with more stats to worry about, so I uninstalled it.Years later I gave it another try, but instead invested more into the story and gameplay, and I ended up really liking what the game did offer. STALKER definitely offers a unique 'gritty' experience that many other games won't ever aim for. Its a neat cross between something you would see in a more realistic tactical shooter, but has some of the exploration elements that you would see in more open-world games. Definitely worth checking out.			"

Between the vast swaths of abandoned structures that you can explore, and the wonderful dynamic weather system, Stalker is a game that truly and deeply immerses you in a terrifying alternate reality.  Truly, I cannot say enough about this bona fide classic.  PS:  And don't let its age scare you away.  Get the easy to install Stalker Complete mod, and this game looks and runs just fine on a modern rig.  Also, be sure to read Roadside Picnic, and watch the movie Stalker, for a better idea of the origins of the Zone.			"

												The only game I can compare this to is Fallout, but I know that is wrong. Fallout does not come close to what Stalker presents. The level of immersion, not to mention paranoia is the best I have experienced in any game. Stalker feels like a more serious and realistic Fallout, meaning that survival is THE most important thing. You always need to keep your eyes open and your ears listening or you could end up walking into death. You never know who is enemy or friend. And don't get me started about the mutants...I would buy this game, as well as the other Stalker games, for every one of my friends if I could!Worth the purchase!			"

												One of the best games I have played.Extremely immersive, very tactical, incredibly fun overall with lots of things to do.BUT, if you're gonna get this game, for the love of C'thulu, get the Stalker Complete Mod. The game gets even better with it, realistic time, you can sleep, the accuracy is improved (the first weapons in the game have the worst accuracy known to man without this mod), and the world is completely dynamic, meaning that bandits can come from other regions and settle in abandoned houses in the area, etc.Get this game!

												Shadow of Chernobyl is a fun and expansive game set in ""The Zone"", an area of Ukraine that was directly affected by the Chernobyl Plant disaster. With that out of the way, I'd like to get down to why this game is so incredible. Atmosphere. You wont find a game that pulls you in and holds you there quite like a Stalker game. The game has a way of simply including you in the zone, making you feel as if every encounter is life or death and the moments in between are a sweet breath of fresh air. I tell you, there's nothing like coming in from the clustering darkness to an old railway station after fighting off hordes of obnoxiously intelligent (and I'm being serious, STALKER ai is frightening to fight against, and is rumored to be able to complete the game on their own) bandits to find a group of fellow Stalkers and rookies huddled around a trashcan fire, speaking softly in Russian, knowing in here, around friends, just for tonight- You're safe.Shootouts are frequent and heart pounding. It's recommended you play on Master difficulty with the crosshairs disabled. You and your target are likely to go down in a few hits. As I said before, the Ai is frighteningly intelligent. They will actively move towards you if they can, flanking and moving from cover to cover, plunking shots all the while. This makes choosing your cover very important, and forces you to keep a close eye on who your fighting with. All too often I've damn near ♥♥♥♥ myself because I let a bandit come up behind me while I was trading shots with a few of his buddies in a run down far. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oneself, The Zone is not only populated with bandits, but monsters as well, all of them designed and built around fear.STALKER is an RPG of sorts. You've got an inventory system, weight system, you need to eat every so often, there's an economy, weapons and armor to pick from, factions and reputation- It's got it all. Will I tell you it's done well? Not all of it. Don't expect to level up or pick our perks. That can somewhat be accomplished by recovering artifacts, but it's certainly not the same. Still, that's no reason to not check out the game. STALKER in the end is a fun and terrifying game, one that makes you feel like a rugged post-apocalyptic Ukranian artifact hunter and full time bandit/creature slayer. Shadow of Chernobyl comes highly recommended, and once you've done a vanilla play through, there's an abundance of mods to try out. Then go on to pick up CS and Call of Pripyat. Good hunting, Stalkers.			"

												This s probably one of the most amazing FPS i have ever played, yes it has its bugs like ""multiple spawns"" NPCs without collision,one or two missions broken..The atmosphere is fantastic and unlike any other game out there. it was in development for years and even though they didn't manage to include everything they wanted, what they did is still incredible. this is no Console shooter or port, if you want a simple run and gun don't buy it and play for 20 minutes and complain when unlike Crysis you can't kill everything in 10 seconds with your hitech gun and invincible p0ssy suit.,Gameplay is about doing quests, roaming around the Chernobyl zone, avoiding deadly ""anomalies"" and radiactive area and battling with bandits, military, mutants and aggressive wildlife.Zone represent area around Chernobyl with forests, plains, city of Pripyat, nuclear plant...The game is mostly FPS but RPG elements are very strong.Models and textures are a bit outdated but light and shadows are very impressive.

												Stalker may be the crown-jewel of Slavic post-apocalyptic games, surpassing even Metro 2033. With beautiful environments, a haunting ambient soundtrack, and vicious monsters, Stalker sets a dark tone for this survival-horror shooter. However, you will find that, unlike Metro 2033, humans play as great as threat as the monsters, perhaps even more so depending on how you play. With dozens of weapons, quests, and characters, you will be well prepared to discover all of Chernobyl's secrets. What is more, compared to Western post-apocalyptic games such as Fallout, Stalker possesses a much deeper and more intense story, especially towards the end, when the truth is revealed. Normally I would never recommend mods for a game, but in this case, I believe that Stalker Complete is well worth it, removing/fixing multiple glitches, and thus contributing to a smoother game. Overall, despite the savage nature of the environment, one cannot help but be impressed with how beautifully the developers strung together the story and characters. Overall Score: 10/10			"

												You're not going to find a better example of a flawed masterpiece in gaming.You'll being able to read the very minds of the creators of this game if you play enoughWhat you can't find out will abuse your curiosity, in this game every piece of cut content has a backstory. The atmosphere outshines all the graphical problems. You'll be damned to experience the feeling of being back into society than when you arrive back to the bar after a long day hunting. The final run onto the CNPP and the 7 endings will challenge conventional FPS abities that have been dormant since the first Far Cry. The music, between MooZe's atmospheric score and Firelake's action music will set in more than just fear, proving this superior to an ordinary horror game. Thiis is Fallout 3 and the kictchen sink. Few games have made me more relieved to find an AI controlled ally when I'm low on health. Also what other game allows you to steal a gun from a dead Gordon Freeman?10/10			"

												Strongly recommended.I first bought the game media DVD days after it was relased and reached my region... however, due to various reasons, I could not play it until now... those reasons were mainly language barrier (not native English, or good English at that time), so I could not understand much of the game back then... also my first encounter of the bloodsucker :D it made me jump on my seat... (I'll never forget that moment :D), so I thought: this is not the right time to play this game...I kept it in the shelve collecting dust, ignoring it, and I thought I wasted my money on it...Now, I got it on steam, and finally I could understand English well, so I thought, why not give it a try and see what is this game really is?I installed the 3 games, and started with SoC 2 weeks ago, and I just finished it...This game is now my number one game and I loved every single moment of it while I was playing... I lived with the main character through every single corner and place of it, and I will not forget my time playing this game...I will replay it, and I will make different choices through the game, again and again... I will not get bored of it I'm sure of this...This game has everything, RPG (of course), action, horror, mysteries, stealth and sneaking, and even some drama...This series (the 3 games Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat), made me feel really sad for that there will be no STALKER II of it... and I really hope that a day will come and I see this got a ""II"" after its name...I definately recommend this to every single gamer who want adventure and all types of game play mixed in 1 game...This should get more hype and more known over some ""big"" titles out there.

												Whoever praises Fallout 3 and New Vegas, should have firstly played this game.I'm not saying this game is better than Fallout 3, I'm just saying that this title is the real post-apocalyptic FPS experience.So many years have passed and now I've played this game also on Steam, and I must say that even if time passes by, this game never gets old.Let's start with the main point of this game: gameplay.Not considering the RPG style inventory and quest system, the ballistic of weapons is something you don't see often so well made in an FPS.After handling well a weapon, you acquire the skill to use it right, and every weapon feels different.Enemy's AI is another great point in favor: they always know how to catch you the right way, disregarding of the place, and their movements are always smart and unpredictable.I think this AI is smartest than F.E.A.R.'s one, and probably the best I've ever seen in an FPS.Graphics are very good, even if a bit dated. The entire zones are fully explorable and they are wonderfully designed.Sounds of weapons feel like having a gun in your hand and when you get hit, you can feel it on your skin.The overall experience is something very unique considering standard FPS games on the market.For the bad part: the game lack most of the fundamental tweaks, like fast travelling (yeah, this is pretty boring, especially because enemies respawn), the possibility to repair your equipment, time limited side quests and a fixed and low limit for carriage (I know it's ""realistic"" that your character can carry just 50 Kg, but it's a videogame and it's boring).The very bad of this game is the plot [SPOILER ALLERT]:Yeah, there may be some cool moments and twists, but the story is pretty stupid (go there, then there, then I need you to take that and carry it on there...) and the only narrative value is the way it let you know the story behind the catastrophe, but as a character based story, it's not so interesting.Probably, the ending is the most disappointing thing of this game: almost all the endings have a pretty stupid horrifying theme and they really don't satisfy the great work that the player have been done to accomplish all of this.I think this is one of these games that should be definitely be played by every FPS lover, after Half-Life and F.E.A.R.

												Mutant mayhemThe STALKER games have a reputation for being tough, and it’s well-deserved -- this is probably the most challenging single-player game I’ve played. Both the open world and the AI are very unforgiving. There are constant dangers not just from the wide variety of enemies but also from high levels of radiation and strange spatial anomalies. The Zone is a large place and during the course of the game you get to visit a diverse range of environments and encounter many weird malevolent forces. The combat is always demanding and requires a good deal of strategic thinking given that you have to deal with other health-depleting factors at the same time. The story, although it does suffer from the usual lack of focus as a result of non-linear gameplay and some uninspiring side quests, is still reasonably strong and engaging. Graphically it’s quite impressive, although I should point out that I installed the STALKER Complete 2009 mod from the get-go, which (as I understand it) improves on the vanilla game in this area. It’s true that there are some annoying bugs, but they didn’t dampen my enjoyment of the game too much. And even though the weapons and armour deteriorate (a feature I’m not overly fond of) the speed with which this occurs is more realistic than in many RPGs so it didn’t bug me too much. Overall the game scores very highly for its outstanding atmosphere, which is one of the most engrossing, and idiosyncratic, that I’ve encountered. Highly recommended. 4/5			"

The gameplay throughout the story is intense action and fun at the same time. The game has a realistic fighting system with bleeding effects and radiation. There's also the mutants that you can fight with. If the story isn't good enough for you, there's tons of side missions and free roam exploration. You can even win favor from different factions in the game and get special weapons and suits from them only. The only problem is in this game you can't join factions and control them without mods. So if you like large free roam survival games, then get this.			"

												I installed and started this game on 4 different occasions and hated it... on the 5th time i do no know why i kept going back (kept hearing that i would like it) i did it with stalker complete mod to polish up graphics and game play. and found a amazing world that existed whether i was there or not. the AI in this game is truly amazing for all of it s problems. but the atmosphere is the real winner having grown up on military bases in CA it gave me a strange familiar feeling that was very welcoming to my exploratory nature. the story felt... broken... but was still unique. it is an fps with rpg hidden inside of it. the real reason for exploration new artifacts and gun/ gun parts. i really enjoyed being able to put silencers and scopes on different weapons i think that made the game much better than other shooters. it also requires thought for survival it will not hold your hand at all.

												STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the most atmospheric games I've played. Unlike many devs, the devs of STALKER paid ridiculous attention to small, near meaningless details, which together add up to a very immersive game. With fun gunplay, decent difficulty, a great story, and excellent exploration, this game deserves more than it's current ""cult favourite"" status.Protip: If you're going to play, play on Master difficulty, as on Master all weapons deal more damage (yours included!) and enemies have more advanced AI (flanking and such), leading to extremely fun and interesting firefights.Also has an absolutely brilliant modding community. I'd recommend trying out Zone Reclamation Project for a first playthrough, and AMK (difficulty), Zone of Alienation (Difficulty + immersion), or OGSE (Loads of new content) for a second/third/fourth/etc, playthrough.

												This game is amazing, seriously. The base game is fun, but where this entire series shines is its modding community. If you get the base game, put on some mods to improve the buggy nature of the game, and maybe throw in an overhaul mod of your choice this game is completely unique. Imagine sitting down around a campfire, the night pitch black around you, as a rookie S.T.A.L.K.E.R. plays a guitar next to you while you check over your magazines and load them with some of the new bullets you bought. Suddenly, shots ring out and all of the rookies spring up as the military soldiers down the road finally decide to clear out the camp and you have to fight back decently armed soldiers with shotguns and submachine guns.This game can be incredibly immersive if you allow yourself to be drawn in, and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid of a difficult game and a realistic FPS.

												Genius. One of the best and most atmospheric open-world FPS games I've played. This isn't really an RPG like The Elder Scrolls or Bethesda's Fallout games -- there are no levels or stats, no character creation, no classes or races to choose from... you are simply the Marked One, and your adventure is a bleak, lonely voyage around the mysterious and often hostile Zone. I would still like to see a game that approaches Tarkovsky's Stalker and its ideas a bit more subtly, but there's enough familiar stuff here to make things interesting for fans of that film and other sci-fi...

												STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl was one of those games where if you didn't know what it was about originally, you would have passed on it. STALKER provides an exceedingly interesting set of gameplay purely with the unique and realistic takes on accuracy and survival.  Rather than having each weapon be pin-point accurate, each have their own charactaristics. This makes finding one you like, and learning it's characteristics leaving the player feeling as if he is actually learning how to use these weapons, and not just picking them up and instantly being proficient.

												Completely brimming with bleak atmosphere, STALKER is a very immersive game. The wasteland feels very harsh and unforgiving, and many of the creatures that will be encountered are quite unnerving. Inventory management is always a concern, but does not feel like too much of a chore. Gunplay requires precision, and on the master difficulty you can ambush and kill enemies just as effectively as they can ambush and kill you. The game starts with the player feeling very weak, and this can be frustrating as going into every fight at a large disadvantage is rough, and requires liberal use of save files. However, once better equipment is obtained, the tables are turned! The player ends up being much stronger than most of the dangers of the Zone. This relieves a bit of the tension, but it does not trivialize the game's difficulty. Unfortunately, the story is a bit weak in this game, and many important plot threads are left as side-quests, which could cause a lot of important details to be skipped over unintentionally.			"

												This is probably my favorite game of all time. The game has an amazing story. If you enjoy Russian/Ukrainian science fiction mixed with urban legend wrapped up in a big, beautiful plot twist bow, then this is the game for you. Although the story may feel patchy at times, I enjoyed it the whole way through. There are about 7 different endings, two of them being very special. This game effectively incorporates horror, action, and survival tactics into one large environment. This is a very immersive game; the audio is spectacular, the lighting system is top notch, the enemies are terrifying, and the combat system is well put together and feels good. There are plenty of enjoyable mods for this game which does increase the replay value. If you get this game, I highly suggest playing on the hardest difficulty. The game will be much more enjoyable. I never got into the faction system very much, but if you enjoy factions then it's a feature of the game. I did not experience very many bugs or glitches while playing this game, yet it seems that others have had a lot of difficulties with bugs and glitches. I believe the bugs and glitches in this game are hit or miss. Overall, this is a well made game with a superb story and I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys RPG-FPS style games.			"

												STALKER is a brilliant FPS that blends RPG and horror elements.What makes STALKER stand out is, hands down, the atmosphere. It's a semi-open world game where you can explore areas to find stashes and run into other stalkers and their respective factions. The stalkers are those that roam the zone, the area within and surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. As you can imagine, the zone is infested with pockets of radiation that can cause severe harm, strange monsters roam about, people fight for survival, ecologists are simply trying to study, and you're at the center of it all.In the game, you play as the ""Marked One"", a stalker that was left for dead on a 'death truck'. Luckily for you, a fellow loner/stalker finds you and takes you to Cordon, where the gameplay begins. Because you're rescued by a fellow stalker who is employed by the local trader, you're tasked with a few missions and he also helps you set up your PDA where your sole mission that was already there is to ""Kill Strelok"". Who is Strelok? Well, play the game and find him, dammit.The story is really intricate, but let's shift away from that as it really boils down from going to area to area and accepting missions, sidequests, fighting in an arena for money, trading and selling goods, collecting weapons, ammo, etc. The story is really good by the way, but I just wanna talk about the gameplay. It's an FPS, duh. It's not like other FPS games, though, as it's more open in your choices, there are dialog options, albeit limited, and you can swap armor. It's not exactly an RPG, however, as there is no leveling system employed. And it's not a full on horror game as it's not terribly scary, there's just some really bizarre creatures that you run into. Most of the time, however, you'll be shooting other humans.The atmosphere is grimy, grey, and at some points, yellow, but not in a filtered Fallout 3 kind of way. It's natural lighting. Well, technically artificial, but you get the point. Buildings are destroyed, people speak about staying alive, playing guitars around a fire pit, smoking, laughing, drinking. The atmosphere is really cool with both the characters and how they interact and the world, itself.Pripryat shines in this game, the devs clearly took the time to research the city, the blueprints of the city, and I believe they visited the city as well, considering the devs are Ukrainians. As the devs are Ukrainians, that means the spoken language is accurate, the facial designs are accurate, etc. These guys knew what they were doing and they also did the scientific research as far as radiation pockets and possible effects of an expanding radiated zone. Very good game.9.2/10			"

												If you ever wanted to feel like your ballsack was made of hardened leather - Play S.T.A.L.K.E.RIf you ever wanted to truly experience an atmosphere that could give you shivers so hardthat your grandkids will feel it too - Play S.T.A.L.K.E.RIf you want a game to be as hard as you junk when you play it - Play S.T.A.L.K.E.R!This game will truly make you feel really cheeki, when you constantly quicksave and rip your ♥♥♥♥ off in terror and rage whilst managing to eat sausages and drink vodka to avoid starvation and radiation!I can only recommend this game, and those who does not have the balls to pick it up, should just try to grow some by playing it!

												i can't stress to you enough how good this game is. if you like fallout or post-apocalyptic game settings this is the game for you. i played vanilla SoC all the way through then decided to try the SoC complete mod. i never would have fully appreciated that mod if i'd not have played vanilla version all the way through. Bottom line, cram this game into your brain through your eyes immediately!! Best russian prey simulator out there! Would hunt russians again 10/10			"

One of the very few games I've replayed. The only game I replayed thrice. Outstanding mods have been released for the title as well. "

												Similar quality to Fallout 3/Fallout New Vegas except with a plethora of gopniks with guns instead of ghouls.  More bleak/harsh atmosphere than Fallout.  Practice your Russian as the npcs tend to blather on about I-Have-No-Freaking-Clue (but I can guess by tone).  At first the difficulty level and bullet registry will be challenging for even the most tempered fps adventurer.  Everyone is disposable, there are no women or children, no moralistic mantras being force-fed.  You're literally tossed out into this harsh environment to fend for yourself.  In soviet Russia toilet uses you.  Use your PDA -a Lot of information is there.  Don't know what this strange/weird symbol or thing is?  Search for Zone Survival Guide.  I typically like playing un-modded games however I highly recommend Zone Reclamation Project mod as an exception here.  It removes the idiotic quest time limits.  As an example:  you'll get an automated quest to save some stalkers in various areas from bandits.  You do that.  Your PDA says go pick up your reward which is 100 kilometers away, possibly in some area you've never been to before, all on foot -there is no fast travel/vehicles.  So you're supposed to hike all the way to wherever just to have some npc give you 2 bottles of vodka and a few rubles.  I play games for Fun, not time constraints.  Not like I was disarming a bomb.  So I removed those time constraints.Additionally, I tweaked the grid size for my inventory so I didn't have to scroll way, way, way down just to eat some bread.  ZRP with minor tweaks to the vanilla game makes this Excellent.  I would avoid all the other Complete/invasive mods that totally change the game.  It will likely sap the fun out of it/make you too overpowered.Graphics: pretty decent for when it came out  Sound/Music: really immersive/excellent  Gameplay/controls:  ASWD and very responsive  Area loadtimes/stutter:  some minor waits  Glitches: Haven't had too many occur -really stable and I'm nearing the end.  Bottomline: If you want a linear, story-driven game that holds your hand -this ain't it.  If you want an apocalyptic, Russian-themed game with tons of replay and choose-your-own-adventure, this is it.  A hidden gem worth the learning curve/difficulty.			"

												Install it, stick ZRP on, set the difficulty to Master and play it all the way through to the true ending. Then, when you're done I suggest you tell your friends about it and do Call of Pripyat, then Call of Pripyat with the MISERY mod, followed by Clear Sky.

												CHEEKI BREEKI I V DAMKEbut seriously, it's a story about a dude (played by you) who falls off a truck, and has amnesia, with only one note on your PDA: Find and kill someone named ""Strelok"". You are in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, now mutated from the effects of the 1986 disaster. Explorers from outside the Zone have come in to find a new life, riches, to unlock the secrets of the Zone, and find out what's really going on in the center of the Zone at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself. People are paying money for STALKERs to recover strange artifacts from the hazardous anomalous areas of the Zone, so the eggheads can maybe find something to benefit humanity as a whole.Try to regain your memory, explore the Zone in a sandbox-style environment that lets you go where you want, without being shoehorned into linear corridor-style level progression, discover who you are, where Strelok is, and how he fits into all of this.♥♥♥♥ call of duty, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is where it's at.

												This game is an incredible journey through the outlying areas near the Chernobyl Powerplant. The story is wonderfully crafted, the weapons get better as you progress, and you will always find a fight that is quite enjoyable. That being said, the game is buggy. Well, it was for me. But that didn't stop me as it was so amazing. The atmosphere really did wonders and the creepy dark noisy hallways and bunkers where you knew mutants were was just terrifying! This game is an FPS game with RPG mechanics. It is solid and didn't need DLC because the developers released the game complete and it was long enough by itself. If you want a more updated game, there are mods to make this game look brilliantly amazing considering what its limits are. All in all, great game.			"

												The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are the most immersive games ever. If you haven't played them before I strongly suggest you play Shadow of Chernobyl. For the first playthrough I suggest playing vanilla (no mods) or with Stalker Complete 2009 mod. On lower difficulties the gunplay is not so good. You will miss when your crosshair is on an enemy because the enemies also miss when they should hit you. I suggest you play on the highest difficulty for the best experience.			"

												This is defintitely one of my favourite games. Once you disable the annoyingly shaky headbob, it's very easy to get absorbed in this wonderful world. The gameplay is great, the atmosphere is great, the story is... okay I guess, and the graphics really aren't that great, even for 2006. But graphics really don't matter at all. This game is GREAT. It definitely makes my top 10 list, maybe even top 5. However, if you are new or not very good at games, I wouldn't recommend this to you. It's VERY hard even on the easiest difficulty. Or maybe it's just because I'm playing it on a laptop. I DON'T KNOW. Again, great game, highly recommended, possibly the best atmosphere presented in ANY game, and if you care it's also easily modable. So yeah. I think it's worth the $20 and a MUST for any true PC gamer.			"

												A classic RPG/FPS hybrid that has yet to find an equal in regards to atmosphere and gunplay. A must-have if you're a fan of shooters, but if you have a low tolerance for bugs you might want to look elsewhere -- vanilla STALKER has a lengthy Crime and Punishment-sized list of glitches, crashes, and game-breaking issues, but there are mods that minimize or fix most of these. Speaking of mods, there are a ton of them available for the game, and they do anything from restoring cut content or improving the aging graphics to adding whole new storylines, weapons, and areas.STALKER is an adventure game hidden in a first person shooter. Highly recommended!			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a refreshing shooter in a world of mindless copy & paste shoot em' ups. It's enemy AI is still better than most modern day games even a decade later and the atmosphere is remarkably well done. While it has clunky or annoying aspects to it's design, such as weapon inaccuracy being a bit too exaggerated, enemies being somewhat bullet spongey (go for headshots) and the occasional bug, it provides a unique experience that may not be for everyone, but is worth checking out. Just remember to quick-save often. :)			"

												(Just a note: I played this game on the highest difficulty and WITHOUT MODS and don’t come crying to me saying that you need to use mods for a better experience or something along those lines) Stalker shadow of Chernobyl is a free roaming fps game. Stalker takes place in what’s known as the zone after the nuclear incident in Chernobyl which has ruined a lot of the landscape, turned most animals into monsters, and poisoned a lot of areas with radiation and has created what are called anomalies which are murderous whether effects in one small spot, you play as a stalker (which stands for scavenger, trespasser, adventurer, loner, killer, explorer and robber) known as the marked one, you have amnesia and you are left with a PDA saying to kill some guy named Strelok, the story is almost non-existent but that doesn’t matter because a lot of games I play the story takes a huge backseat and doesn’t really matter that much. Stalker’s gameplay revolves around exploration, combat and completing quests and side quests which will give you rewards given to you by various people you’ll come across which will be marked on your PDA. In stalker you have an inventory system very similar to resident evil 4 where it’s a grid and each item will appear as a diagram and will take up space on the grid only you can stack all items, there’s weight limit with the inventory system: once you’re above the weight limit your stamina will drop extremely quickly if it will let you sprint. You have various suits and artefacts that you can find which all have different effects on the player such as resistance to radiation, reduction to how much you’ll bleed out when you are shot, an increase in stamina etc. You have a hunger and thirst system which you’ll need to use drinks and food when an icon appears on the right side of the screen, you’ll have to drink vodka or use certain medical equipment for when you have radiation poising and you’ll have to use bandages and med kits to stop you from bleeding out which both of these are notified by an icon that will appear on the right side of the screen. You can also trade items with various NPCs. There are also various enemy factions which you’ll come across in this game. It’s extremely difficult to say what’s to like about this game but one thing I can say is that this game is strangely compelling but it comes with a few glaring issues and problems.Stalker has some of the worst gunplay I’ve ever seen in any shooting game, most of the time you can’t hit what you’re aiming at, regardless of the distance between you and what you’re shooting at, regardless of whether you’re stood still or moving, regardless of your posture, regardless of whether you’re spraying or using burst fire or single shots and for the most part regardless of what weapon you’re using. However if you turn on the crosshair, unless the gun has a scope, hip firing is significantly more accurate than using iron sights,well when you put it on paper you are more accurate firing at a wall using iron sights from a distance but this magically disappears when shooting at an enemy, and hip firing is generally more effective against enemies and it also doesn’t help that the iron sights are horrible in this game and seriously get in the way. Even if you are going for the “realistic” way: DON’T, because iron sights are useless in this game (they’re better in the two sequels though)  The combat is just far too inconsistent in this game. In most games the enemies can hit you most if not every single time and the damage output is consistent and varies game to game, in Stalker the enemies have a completely random chance of hitting you, they also have a random damage output, so sometimes you’ll get just a scratch but others you’ll die instantly. A perfect examples of this is where I had to defend an area from a bandit raid, I was about 50 feet away from the enemies, they seemed to be unable to hit me until one of them suddenly and randomly did and I died instantly. You can go from an enemy noticing you and killing you instantly in one shot, then reload a save but this time that enemy might not be able to hit anything even when you are banzai charging towards them with the knife, which I have done before. Your success all comes down to retrying until you succeed because you got lucky, it doesn’t ever feel like skills matter in this game, and it’s, not like reaction time matters or anything in this it’s just ridiculous. There is the argument of “it’s trying to be realistic” no game is properly realistic, none, not even something such as Arma 3. I guess quite a fair bit in reality with wars can be down to luck but nothing like in this game. when you reload a save, the enemies go back to their starting positions and sometimes their starting positions are behind you and you’ll get killed right away when you’ve loaded a save.The movement in this game is almost headache inducing it does this really sickening head bobbing when you move, it sways to the bottom left and right really quickly. I’ve had an extremely difficult time deciding whether to recommend this game or not, I guess it all comes down to whether you think you can put up with these problems and I’m only recommending this game because I don’t hate it enough to not recommend it. Though after several playthroughs I like it significantly more than the first time I played this game. I have played this game with some mods but to be honest, you should just play the vanilla game because the mods don't really make much difference or properly improve the game, they all pretty much update the graphics, improve one or two features, overlook some of the issues and then add new ones on top, a lot of people say “oh it fixes all of the bugs”, well I can tell you I’ve played quite a bit of the vanilla game and I’ve NEVER come across a bug. There’s also a trend that’s been going around for a while with games such as the Stalker games, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and onward, where people think playing it with mods is better and they become complete elitist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and have a massive go at people for playing the vanilla game and look down on them as if they are sub human. You can’t just ignore all of the problems with the vanilla game and say “oh but with this mod it’s great”, that’s like taking some really crappy games such as Ride to hell Retribution and that claiming playing it with mods is good, and the vanilla game matters the most. ♥♥♥♥ this trend, and all of the elitist people who support it.

												Quite a fun game, well worth a play, but be warned it is SO easy to break the sequence and cause the entire story to be broken. If you do the wrong mission at the wrong time an entire group of people you need to talk to in order to continue the story will attack you on sight, and this is not a fixable problem.You also have to travel to different regions quite often, so the effects of this might not be completely obvious to you until it's too late.Aside from that, the mechanics are spot on, the survival requirements are real, the feeling of satisfaction when you get new gear or conquer a new area is awesome, and the mods available are damn cool as well.

												SoC is hard to describe. It's both the best and the worst of the series. It's a lot like Lost Planet in that regard.Let me start by saying it's as buggy as maggots in cow ♥♥♥♥. If you can't deal with that, I can't recommend the game. You're going to have at least one crash. In my experience, I actually had to heal manually-- using items on bodies crashed the game. I'd look past the bugs though. Stalker SoC is the perfect mix of story, combat, world-building, and atmosphere. It tells the best over-arching story of all three games, and has a mixture of good combat and good atmosphere. Stalker Clear Sky has my favorite combat and gameplay of the series, but it seriously lacks purpose and meaning. It DOES have atmosphere, but not in the lonely, horrifying way SoC and CoP focus on.Stalker Call of Pripyat has the best atmosphere, focusing more on side-missions and powerful events, but it doesn't feel like anything massive is going on. You're a guy in the Zone who has a hard life and sees bad things. The atmosphere here is perfect BECAUSE you aren't important, but the sense of scale is toned back. Stalker SoC doesn't do combat or agency as well as Clear Sky, and it doesn't do gripping side-missions and stories like CoP, but it DOES build the world for them to exist in. Without SoC's worldbuilding, Clear Sky and CoP wouldn't have as much oomph as they do. You wouldn't feel as connected to the Zone. You wouldn't be a stalker. Which is why you're here anyways, right? Buy SoC and play it first. Get connected, have some feels, get cheeki breeki. Play Clear Sky and operate with other stalkers. Feel cool. Rage at the bugs. Then buy CoP and play it last. Let it translate all the feelings you've developed into one concise experience. It'll make a lasting impression on you. Then get ready for the memes. If you've gotten through the first, you've essentially branded ""im a dank slav"" on your chest. Have fun. You're in the cool kids club now.			"

												Fantastic Gem of a game that somehow I missed.  Picked this title up on sale and its really great.  The scary level of immersion, genuinely creepy atmospheres and tough difficulty (challenging not frustrating) make this a win in my book.There are a few bugs in the game, but nothing ive encountered that has been totally game breaking in any way, and there is a large modding community out there that removes these bugs and does other things as well.The story is decent, and there is a fun quest system that will have you up and running in this game in no time.8/10 (FPS / RPG)			"

												This game was phoooking pwnage for its time! What makes it great is not what you get whilst you play it, but rather  the eerie industrial feeling you get after you've completed it.It's definitely a 35 hour game. And you'll know whether you like it within 8 hours. It's definitely not a game where you can stop for a few days, play some other game and then resume it. You have to play it in one go.There are several endings. I think 5 wishmaker endings and 2 real endings to the game. The wishmaker endings are based on how you played the game right from the start.A lot of reading, but I reckon it added production value. I couldn't imagine S.T.A.L.K.E.R with characters speaking directly to me. It just wouldn't have been the same.Memorable moments:- Some invisible monster in a dark underground tunnel.- Some area where the whole screen goes yellowish and you see apparitions.- Chernobyl, obviously ... and the abandoned city that surrounds it.- The end talk about C-Consciousness.

												Amazing game. 9/10Graphics are all right, and for a game made in 2007, they're pretty good. Gameplay is good, combat is phenomenal and so immersive, AI is good but can't take cover, throw grenades and so on. Story is great, multiple endings. Music is fantastic, sounds are beautiful, but limited. Not much voice acting, except for combat, where it's hilarious cause they speak russian and I don't.Great storyline, and immersiveness. Has proper multiple endings, including 3 endings which you can fail in and obviously this ends the game earlier. Super immersiveness, great environment, ambient sounds and okay stealth system. My only major problem is no fast travel, so if you wanna go back to earlier areas you have to walk there, which takes like an hour if you have reached the Duty base.Another problem is that you can't fix items, so if your weapons starts jamming or your suit is damaged, you can't repair 'em and you have to buy new ones, and that's super expensive.Lovely game. Spent well over 400 hours playing it.Never tried multiplayer.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a first person shooter survival game. The description is accurate if not complete, because this game is a lot more, I would add sandbox and exploration to the mix at least. I will come back to this a bit later in the review. You start the game in a rather nondescript way, you were left for dead in a field and wake up in the fringes of the ""zone"" with no memory. By investigating and exploring the ""Zone"" , a large exclusion perimeter of roughly 30 sq kilometers around Chernobyl which have been sealed off by the Ukrainian army, you hope to regain your memory and discover the place secrets. The ""zone"" is very dangerous, not only because of all the bandits , trigger happy military, mutants  and mercenaries roaming the place, but also the ""natural"" phenomenons called anomalies that will shreds you to pieces, burn you alive or electrify you depending of the type if you step on the wrong place. There is offcourse the radiations areas you must avoid in order to survive. The zone contains lot of treasures to find however , mysterious artifacts that can be very valuable and ""caches"" of gear left over by other lesser fortunate stalker which you have to find. Those treasures and caches give an incentiv for you to explore the «zone» desolate landscape with it's abandonned factories and villages following the 1986 disaster. The people behind the game made a really good work depicting the zone and people who grew up in the 80's and 90s and have seen reports from the Chernobyl disaster in the medias will recognise several landmarks , like the famous  wheel of Pritpjat or the Chernobyl plant itself. The SGS Gameworld team did an excellent work at rendering the place in a very realistic way and at time I marveled of the landscapes of the ruined area in all their sadness. All in all the atmosphere in this game is topnotch and it makes even the most mundane generated quest an experience as you get to explore all those places , abandoned villages and ruined factories with the leftover of old trucks and cars there and here , a sad but beautiful reminder of the madness and destructiveness of human civilization. The inhabitants of the zone are no less fascinating, and not all are enemies bend on killing you. many are stalkers like you or mercenaries hoping to find the mysterious but dangerous riches the zone has to offer. At night you might you might encounter small groups gathering around small fires telling stories , laughing (in russian) or playing the guitare. This gives an human dimension to the people of the place, stalkers like you trying to make it. The story in the game is also very good if not always very clear, especially in those days when we're  tea spooned feed in other games plotwise, S.T.A.L.K.E.R let you do a lot of guesswork on what is really going on, and the answers you get from the plot usually set up more questions. Even the discoveries you make in the game are up to discussion about their meanings. Having finished the game which has no less than two distinct ending, and several versions of those ending depending of your gamestyle and decisions, I personally loved it but it's probably not everyones cup  of tea if you desire a more traditional tale with a “everybody lived happily ever after” end.  It must be said that the game has been partly inspired by the Sovietic art film directed by Stratovsky, Stalker taking on question as existentialism and human potential ,  you will find many elements from the movie in the game although it goes less into philosophy . Just like it's cinematic counterpart S.T.A.L.K.E.R isn't easy to gauge, let's just say it's a great experience gamewise.The gameplay in S.T.A.L.K.E.R isn't very varied, but what it does, it does well. We've gone into the sandbox and exploration part of the game, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a competant first person shooter in it's own right, I found the enemies to be challenging and at time rather smart, hiding from me and trying to flank me or throwing grenades at me when possible. During the game you discover many different guns and rifles, both of Russian and Western fabrication. Although I'm not a gun specialist, I found the weapon system to be rather realistic and entertaining, with the weapons themselves true copies of the originals, mostly weapons dating from the 70 to the 90's, something you'd probably find if you were stuck in a postsovietic zone in the near future. The quests , especially the generated ones,  can be rather bland but the great atmosphere of the game saved it from being a shore. While the main story was quite entertaining and really catched my interest through the game. It must be said the game could be rather creepy if not directly scary at time while you explore abandoned depots teaming with dangerous mutants and hidden enemies in the dark. I was a bit annoyed toward the end of the game when I was rather suddently forced to change my gamestyle from “crawling and shooting” which I had done in the majority of the game to “running and shooting” as I had helicopters shooting at me , leaving me no chance to challenge them. Other annoyances would be the bugs, although I played the “complete Mod” which eliminated many of them , I had a few crashes , but nothing gamebreaking. All in all I can only recommend this game (which I would recommend to play with a Mod to eliminate the bugs), a competant shooter with a good if a bit convoluted plot  and a great atmosphere than very few games can measure themselves with. This game is quite old (from 2003) but has a vibrant community who deliver new mods and addons to improve the original product to this day.   "

 Originally posted on January 28, 2009 When I first heard of STALKER, it was the graphics and spooky atmosphere that impressed me. That was over 5 years ago. Since then it has undergone a convoluted and long development process, which left many to believe the game was dead. Well, the finished product is pretty good, despite some bugs and missing features.You play the role of marked one, in a subtle and chilling story about genetics and radiation experiments in the Chernobyl disaster zone. The place is full of mutants and warring bandits, loners, and factions, and is one of the most atmospheric games I've played.Graphics- The technical visuals are quite solid, as the engine was updated since they originally started development. Shadows cast during storms and by lights stand out in particular. The draw distance is decent enough to make you feel like you're actually in the world, and the animations and effects are quite good.Sound- The sound design in this game is top notch, you can hear every clap of thunder or rustle in the grass, but the gunfire is what really stands out. You can hear every distant shot fired at you and the sound of bullets whizzing by inches from your head.Gameplay- This game has some really incredible survival mechanics. You are forced to scavenge for ammo, food, water, and other survival essentials, or buy them at inflated prices from the few merchants in ""The Zone"". Your inventory allows you to carry a reasonable amount of supplies, but you will get tired quickly if carrying too much. The game does not rely on any traditional RPG stats, but you can improve your chances of survival by finding, stealing, or buying better armor, from simple kelvar-cloth hybrids to full military exoskeletons. You can also obtain a wide breadth of real world guns to fit your playstyle, and they fire a variety of ammunition types, adding another gameplay dynamic. Finally you can find ""artifacts"" out in the zone's many radiation anomalies which can reduce the damage you take from radtiation, boost your health, and increase your stamina, among other things. They also sell for a pretty penny, if you prefer not to be irradiated by artifacts.The zone itself is an interesting and varied wasteland, with some interesting characters and fedgling game dynamics like random bandit attacks on stalker camps (which you have no obligation to assist) and faction alliances.However, the game world is rather linear and segmented, it is a far cry from a true open game world like in the elder scrolls series. Also, the while the main quest and random encounters and factions battles are compelling enough, the minor quests given to you by traders and others feel really generic, like an after thought to the game. They are entirely random and never run out, unlike other games, in their defense. The factions feel like a remnant from alpha- they hardly ever leave their bases and go on raids (except the military) and they have very limited reactions to your actions beyond friend or enemy.The game has been patched and is no longer the buggy release I was told about a while ago.Value- The game can take anywhere from 25-40 hours to complete, but I would advise you to take your time, and explor to find the really rare weapons and gear, and meet all the interesting people. I probably spent closer to 65 hours playing it, which is not bad for a game i got for $5 on steam. It is a good deal even for the current going price of $20.Overall, I would say try this game if a spooky survival shooter with some really original ideas sounds appealing to you. I am excited to see how clear sky plays in comparison, and what else GSC has up their sleeves.			"

												A pretty neat game made by a small Ukrainian studio that only made RTS games prior. It was stuck in development hell from 2000 to 2007, mostly in part because of the fact that an entire new engine had to be made for it that Quake or Unreal couldn't do.This game is noted for its very good ambience and portrayal of environments, being very detailed. While the textures are not exactly great and you can tell the game is dated by playing vanilla, there are mods out there to improve on what's already there.			"

 Originally posted on January 28, 2009 When I first heard of STALKER, it was the graphics and spooky atmosphere that impressed me. That was over 5 years ago. Since then it has undergone a convoluted and long development process, which left many to believe the game was dead. Well, the finished product is pretty good, despite some bugs and missing features.You play the role of marked one, in a subtle and chilling story about genetics and radiation experiments in the Chernobyl disaster zone. The place is full of mutants and warring bandits, loners, and factions, and is one of the most atmospheric games I've played.Graphics- The technical visuals are quite solid, as the engine was updated since they originally started development. Shadows cast during storms and by lights stand out in particular. The draw distance is decent enough to make you feel like you're actually in the world, and the animations and effects are quite good.Sound- The sound design in this game is top notch, you can hear every clap of thunder or rustle in the grass, but the gunfire is what really stands out. You can hear every distant shot fired at you and the sound of bullets whizzing by inches from your head.Gameplay- This game has some really incredible survival mechanics. You are forced to scavenge for ammo, food, water, and other survival essentials, or buy them at inflated prices from the few merchants in ""The Zone"". Your inventory allows you to carry a reasonable amount of supplies, but you will get tired quickly if carrying too much. The game does not rely on any traditional RPG stats, but you can improve your chances of survival by finding, stealing, or buying better armor, from simple kelvar-cloth hybrids to full military exoskeletons. You can also obtain a wide breadth of real world guns to fit your playstyle, and they fire a variety of ammunition types, adding another gameplay dynamic. Finally you can find ""artifacts"" out in the zone's many radiation anomalies which can reduce the damage you take from radtiation, boost your health, and increase your stamina, among other things. They also sell for a pretty penny, if you prefer not to be irradiated by artifacts.The zone itself is an interesting and varied wasteland, with some interesting characters and fedgling game dynamics like random bandit attacks on stalker camps (which you have no obligation to assist) and faction alliances.However, the game world is rather linear and segmented, it is a far cry from a true open game world like in the elder scrolls series. Also, the while the main quest and random encounters and factions battles are compelling enough, the minor quests given to you by traders and others feel really generic, like an after thought to the game. They are entirely random and never run out, unlike other games, in their defense. The factions feel like a remnant from alpha- they hardly ever leave their bases and go on raids (except the military) and they have very limited reactions to your actions beyond friend or enemy.The game has been patched and is no longer the buggy release I was told about a while ago.Value- The game can take anywhere from 25-40 hours to complete, but I would advise you to take your time, and explor to find the really rare weapons and gear, and meet all the interesting people. I probably spent closer to 65 hours playing it, which is not bad for a game i got for $5 on steam. It is a good deal even for the current going price of $20.Overall, I would say try this game if a spooky survival shooter with some really original ideas sounds appealing to you. I am excited to see how clear sky plays in comparison, and what else GSC has up their sleeves.			"

Mean Mr. Mustard's short S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl review 1) Essential - buy it NOW 2) Recommended - buy it on sale 3) AvoidTime to complete – 15-20 hours (played through on the non-Steam version)Played multiplayer? NoWorth revisiting? Yes, plenty of mods which enhance the gameBest part – Unnerving atmosphere and punishing gameplayWorst part – Quite unstable but nothing a few mods can't fix			"

												10/10 no qustions get game with a good story i recomend this for hardcore FPS players that like Horror and free exploation. i recomed you play it though with the copleate mod from Mod DB if you get any bugs as Compleate will remove them but not change the game play.			"

												One of my favorites. Not totally unforgiving, but challenging. Tense as hell in dark corridors and the sounds literally make me jump out of my chair. Fighting against a squad of 8, took out 3, and im listening/looking for them. Most of them sounded or look like they've run off to re-organize, before I move on, I suddenly hear an AKM-74/2U  directly to my right and ""Game Over"". Forgot to check my right, and a soldier ambushed me.Scariest. Thing. Ever.			"
