												Cinders is a pretty fantastic visual novel, full of strong female characters and decisions that have consequences. It's a darker, more mature take on the classic Cinderella fairy tale, but with some clever twists. The artwork and music are really gorgeous and add a lot to the story. It's also worth noting that this is one of the rare visual novels that uses an art style other than anime.The game's a bit short and even going back and playing several endings won't take much longer than a few hours. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of replay value. While there are a lot of different endings in the game, things become a little tedious after you've played through a couple of times. Other than achievement hunting, there's not much payoff for getting all the endings.Even though it's brief, the story and characters are engaging and it's an enjoyable experience while it lasts. It's also a visual novel that's a bit heavier on the novel part than straight-up dating sims; several different pairings can occur, but the focus isn't entirely on romance.I personally think that the $20 price tag is a little steep for such a short game though, so look for sales or bundle deals.

												What an amazing game. Not sure I'm entirely qualified to write a review since this is the only visual novel I've played - but I love the game so much, I have to gush about it. Let's see:Pros:- Incredible soundtrack. It's too bad they don't have that as DLC because if they did, I'd buy it in a second.- Lovely graphics. The artwork is gorgeous in a perfect fairytale way.- Very interesting story. A good thing too if you're going to play over and over for multiple endings.- Rich characters. Their dialog was well written and I cared alot about what happened to them.- Choices really make a difference. The way the story flows is very much up to you. Choose wisely.Cons:- Some of the dialog between characters can get a bit preachy.- As with most ""choose your own adventures"", they don't always give you the choices you'd like.     All in all, if you have any interest in the Cinderella story or a well written book-like game with pleasing artwork and music, I highly recommend this. And with all the many ending variations, there's lots of replay value. I've 100%ed the achievements but there are still 2 endings I really want to see so I'm not done playing yet. What a great game!			"

												Pros:Art MusicGeneral plotCons:A LOT of redundant dialogue, the developers of this game clearly made some unflattering assumptions about their players intelligence. ex. Cinder witnesses two characters talking, then one leaves, Cinder asks the remaining character what they were talking about, remaining character then rehashes the conversation you just read.  It's painful and you start pressing enter rapidly to move to the next scene.Mouth animation that doesn't fit with the otherwise wonderful character art.Every single character in the entire game will lecture you more than once on the evils of making assumptions and stereotyping people.  It is my suspicion that the developer wants you to play Cinder while subverting all the tropes of the Cinderella fairy tale.  I chose options that were more in line with the original story for the first play through, could be why almost every conversation I experienced contained a lecture on stereotypes, but it felt very heavy handed and preachy.

												I'm really interested in visual novels, particularly ones aimed at women, so I've been trying to make a point of everything available in English. I have to say, this is probably the best one I've seen so far.The aesthetics of this game are amazing. The art is beautiful, as you can see from the screenshots, but something they don't show is how everything looks in movement. The backgrounds are subtly animated and the text appears on the screen in a magical shine of color. It's mostly small touches, but it makes the game feel very unique from a lot of other indie visual novels that originally came out in English.Another thing that makes Cinders really stand out is the way they show you how your choices are affecting the game. Every time a line is changed due to one of your choices, a chime plays and a symbol appears in the corner. Once you reach certain goals (which you gain achievements for on Steam) the starting menu will change to show your awards. And after you reach an ending, there's a screen that shows you all the possible variables in the ending you achieved. I'm impressed to see that it looks like there's a LOT of variables in the ending I got, which makes me really interested in what other possibilities there are! (It should also help the game have lots of value as well--my first playthrough was probably around three hours or so, so I'm expecting to get a good amount of playtime in to complete all the endings and branching paths...10-15 hours is what I'm estimating right now.) I was also impressed by the number of choices present in the game--they happen frequently, and never feel pointlessly shoved in. I don't know how well the illusion of choice will hold up in further playthroughs but at least in this first one I really felt like my choices had an impact, which makes me very pleased.As for the story--I loved it. Nearly all of the characters are interesting and have different layers to uncover from what I've seen in the game so far. I particularly like what's been done with the stepsisters--the game doesn't quite make excuses for them, but does a lot to make it make sense why they'd be so cruel to Cinders. Finding out more about Sophia in particular (who is probably my favorite character) is something I'm looking forward to trying to uncover in later playthroughs.If I had one complaint, the only thing I could come up with is that at times the game's dialogue clashes with the tone they seem to be going for. They're trying to make the story feel like it's in a historical place--one where there are elements of fantasy, but that could otherwise reasonably exist at some point in history. But a lot of the dialogue feels oddly modern and even occasionally slang-y. I don't think this is exactly a problem, but it does clash at times with their attempts to make things feel 'historical.' But honestly, that's a nitpick, and one I gave partially so this review wouldn't be completely glowing. Otherwise, this is probably the best Visual Novel I've played, hands down. I'm glad it's finally showed up on Steam.			"

												As far as visual novels go, I have to say that CINDERS is my favorite, thus far.  The game takes the player down a very mature path within a classic children's fairytale.  The player has complete control over the decision making process of the main character.  Thus, with each choice the player makes for Cinders, her personality changes as the game progresses.  There is a large number of outcomes for this character based on those decisions she is presented with throughout the game.  For instance, with the decisions the player chooses for Cinders, she could become very evil or good, very sexual or timid, and/or anywhere in between.  I honestly couldn't believe the number of outcomes this game presents the player with!  The replayability is enormous.  The artwork is absolutely gorgeous.  The music is beautiful.  I applaud how the devs implemented the 'fast forward scene' ability within the game as even though this is a VN, thus a lot of reading, it allows the player to choose whether to read through a scene over and over if they wish OR fast forward through a scene that they have previously experienced.  Please remember, there are NUMEROUS outcomes to this game and over 300 different possible decisions to be made (at minimum)!  The player can also choose the rate of speed that the dialogue is presented, which gives the player a chance to choose either the slower paced dialogue which visually allows 'emphasis' placed on certain words or phrases 'spoken' by each character OR to speed it up and read at the players pace.  I literally just finished the very last outcome for this game before writing this review.  I sat back and just said ""WOW!""  (yes, it's that good!)  I highly recommend this game to any VN lover --- and would really like to see others at least give it a shot.  It truly is a very well thought out game!!!			"

												The artwork is gorgeous, and the ability to skip anything you've already read before makes multiple playthroughs MUCH less of a hassle than youd expect.  It's a retake on the classic fairytale, and I very much enjoy the multiple directions it can go! If you ever loved storybooks as a child (and you can set aside a few character flaws...) it's worth the time to indulge in Cinders' world.			"

												Remember when your grandma used to read you Cinderella and you were thinking: ""what's wrong with her, why she never stands up to those nasty sisters and horrid stepmother, at least, she could drop some flies in their soup, get some ants to their beds and some giant spiders to they rooms"".Well, Cinders doesn't do all those childish things, but your childish dream can be more than fulfilled in this game. Cinders can do things and go places and be mean if need be, and there is need, as we all know.Another great thing about Cinders, we see motivations behind actions, nobody is evil just for the sake of making somebody else look pitiful.This VN is satisfactory on many levels. It looks nice too, dialogue is good and great at times.There are many endings and some heavy choices. Choices are most of the time too obvious, though, but it's hard to expect otherwise when we are talking about so well known tale.I recommend it for all VN fans out there.			"

""Rook di goo, rook di goo! No blood's in the shoe. The shoe's not too tight, This bride is right!"" - Cinderella, Jacob and Wilhelm GrimmAs the first of Moacube's visual novels, Cinders is a roaring success both for its genre and as an example of literary deconstruction. I've been meaning to play this game for years, and now I did, I cannot stop myself from taking new playthroughs to unlock all ending variants, to see what else this game may have in store for me. This unconventional interpretation of the classical folktale Cinderella breaks all stereotypes and social generalizations, presenting an in-depth analysis of all its characters and probable intervening dynamics. Kudos to the developer upfront!At this point, everyone with a semi-European cultural understanding is familiar with the story of Cinderella. Poor, golden hearted young woman who is treated like a slave in her own home by her ambitious stepmother and evil stepsisters. All her kindness only meets with mistreatment until a fairy godmother appears to bless her with a magical dress, a pumpkin carriage and glass slippers to attend the ball of the Prince. There, she is to steal Prince's heart with a glance and become the queen of the kingdom after a short pursuit involving those glass slippers. There, happily ever after, right? Nope, not so much. The original story was a brutal one compared to the Disney-fied version anyhow, and with Cinders now, we are in for a more realistic version of the old fairytale.Here, our protagonist' conditions are more or less the same with the original story. Her father has passed away, and now she is living with her stepmother and two stepsisters, whom treat her little better than a servant. She wishes to change her life, take the control of her future and decide the outcome of her own story though, rather than waiting for magic to happen! Sure, waiting for magic to happen is still our option, but just one of our options nonetheless. We are to live through a week of Cinders to witness the events just before the guard captain of his majesty knocks on our door. What happened to present such a necessity? Now, that is gonna be our choice. We will create a Cinders of our own. We'll make various choices, pick how to act towards whom and what to pursue in the way we chose. Eventually, we will meet one of the various endings appropriate for our personality.In this glamorous visual novel, every single choice sincerely matters. Our actions determine our romance option - yup, we don't have to go happily ever after with the prince - , our character and eventually our own ending. Every single character involving - whether their role in the original story were small or grand - are reimagined into actual people, with their own personalities, background and aspirations. Did you ever think why the stepmother treated Cinderella the way she did? Just because she was evil? Or did you ever take a second glance at the captain of the guards? Why the fairy actually aided our girl the way she did? Because that's what fairies are supposed to do? Definitely not! Here, you are presented with a decent analysis of the story, stripped away from its embellishment and take a realistic approach to the situation, wrapped in genuine medieval context. The result is an incredible story with layers of characterization and perfect narrative with philosophical value.The display is topnotch. All the artwork - both characters and the environment are fitting for a fairytale alright. Yet, this is not the strongest suit of the display. All character CG are presented in a way to maintain noteworthy body language and facial mimics, fortifying the narrative furthermore. Add a breathtaking soundtrack with various instrumental pieces of folk and epic music, and voila: here is a display environment you wouldn't grow tired of playing over and over again.Now, I've already noted that endings are various. There are mainly 4 endings: one fairytale, one lady of the house, one “whatever, I'm out of this place"" and one ""not so happy"". All these endings carry their own varieties within themselves however. According to the romance you pursue, the way you treated people and the amount of information you managed to gather by the end, you'll get a different variety of these endings. Every one of them can be tracked and re-read in the menu too.At the end, Cinders is one of the most imaginative, deep and successfully displayed visual novels that I've ever played. Even if you are not a fan of the genre, you may enjoy this one thanks to its narrative quality, depth and even sense of humor! At this point, I'll be looking forward for any VN that Moacube would throw my way.

												With some regret, I have to say that I do not recommend this game. I really wanted to like this game; the premise was promising and the art style is beautiful (though the scenes are limited; don't expect much variety). This visual novel has the makings of a great novel--great artwork, interesting characters, a wealth of different options, the ability to skip scenes easily on a second playthrough (viewing only the new content you haven't seen before), and most importantly to me, your choices change the outcome of your story. Every choice matters. The only real fault I had with this game was the atrocious writing. It was painful--unrealistic language, blatant foreshadowing, laughable and sometimes downright confusing conversations. The makers of this game went so far into making sure that the player was aware of the nuances of each character that they beat you over the head with them, and then beat the horse you rode in on too. I like subtle, complex characterization, and character growth should be something developed over time and with a touch more realism. Rather than creating nuanced dialogue the game screams it at you, and then has the main character repeat it to herself in her alone time just to make sure you didn't misunderstand anything.I paid $4 for this game via Humble Bundle , and spend roughly 3 hours doing two playthroughs (with numerous bouts of getting up for pizza and tea). If I had paid $20 via steam, I suspect my review would be that much more vitriolic...if you go to the effort of making a well-crafted game, you should spend some time crafting the text with the same dexterity shown elsewhere.

												If you would like to try a visual novel, but anime is not your cup of tea, give this title a chance. This game is (very losely) based on the story of Cinderella, but it's up to the player to decide what Cinder's ""happy ending"" will be. Shall she really just marry the prince? Maybe she should kill her stepmother and take hold of her estate instead? Run away and start a new life elsewhere? Marry the prince but, screw him, rule alone? (Who needs men, anyway?) Of course, if she is not careful, her actions might just blow up in her face.			"

												There’s many things that I like about this game so I’ll do a list:>>>GENERAL STUFF:-The art gorgeous. There are even small background animations as well which makes the scenes livelier. I’m so in love with the art is almost hurts!-If we make a decision and it affects the story differently, a flower appears on the top right of the screen. It’s kind of like the Walking Dead’s “____ will remember that”. Personally, I like the instant feedback on my decisions.-The dialouge between characters can feel a little stiff and awkward at times. Maybe it's because the characters aren't that close with each other and that's why it gives off that vibe.-I love how when we get achievements, the title screen updates and things are added as we discover more things. What in the jellybeans, that’s AMAZING!-The music is gorgeous. There are times when I stop and listen and go “whoa!” one of the conversations got pretty tense and the music followed suit.-I like the attention to detail when the words roll onto the screen. It is as if each word was cast into existence by a small fairy as little colourful sparks burst behind every appearing word.We know when a person is speaking hurriedly, maybe even angrily since the text appears very quickly. When words are spoken by characters with emphasis, the text emerges slowly, and there are pauses at key moments to create tension. I’m usually the type of person who clicks twice to see all the text appear all at once since I’m an impatient reader, but Cinders has made me stop and enjoy watching the text tap happily along the screen.>>>STORY:-The story has a lot of variations (player choices and endings). One ending may have small, but still significant changes that shows up in the epilogue depending on the choices we made.-There is a convenient skip option as well so there isn’t a big pain when replaying for different possibilities.-I personally loved bonding with Cinder’s sisters. I love them and easily got attached to them, problems, flaws and all. If we bond with them a certain way, they react differently to us, differently to others, and maybe even towards themselves.>>>OVERALL:It’s a great game, with a great story, amazing music, stunning art, and the list goes on! It allows us to make choices as we read making us more invested. There are many paths and endings to discover.You may not be too into it if you’re not a big reading fan. But if you enjoy reading or visual novels, Cinders is a MUST GET! Even if you aren’t into visual novels, give this one a go, maybe your tastes will change! There is a demo on their main site to try out at MoaCube.			"

												It's rather unusual to see a visual novel coming from somewhere other than Japan that doesn't attempt to merely emulate those that do, but instead takes hold of the genre and carves a unique path for itself that shows VNs have a lot more to offer than we've thus seen. In the case of Cinders, it also manages to update a classic fairytail into a far more mature and modern story, turning Cinderella into a newly captivating adventurer that eschews many of the originals childish elements for mystery and intrigue. It stumbles a bit along the way, as if walking in its own pair of undersized glass slippers, but on the whole amounts to something unexpectedly enthralling and maybe just a bit magical.I can't imagine anyone is unfamiliar with the story of Cinderella, so I'll skip the introductions. The vile mother and sisters, sad girl living as a servant waiting for the world to change, glass slippers and prince charming are all here as you'd expect, but where Cinders differs is in taking a simple fairy tail and turning it into a mature and intriguing story that is wildly different than how you remember it. Character interactions are full of personal dialogue and emotion, turning the original cliches into actual people you can relate and empathize with. Cinders sisters might be cold, but once their reasons are explained it's hard not to feel sorry for them despite their cruelties. The prince may appear to live a life of carefree amusement, but on the inside his constant questioning of his actions is tearing him apart and making him question his own motives. There are certainly moments when it becomes overly self indulgent with some of its writing, and a few endings feel a bit hollow (though that's to be expected with how many there are), but these moments are overshadowed by the majority of the dialog, which is hugely engrossing and when compiled with the element of your own choices becomes even more compelling, as you shape the outcome to any number of different paths.Which brings me to one of the few areas Cinders slips up a bit, at least in the view of someone who wishes to see more than the one ending they arrive at. Throughout the story (which should take you around 2-5 hours depending on your reading speed) you encounter a myriad of choices which change the story and eventually decide your characters fate. The issue arises in the sheer number of decisions that can have an impact on the ending, and the very limited number of saves you are given, which means you are required to skip through huge amounts of text again and again as you reload and make minor alterations to your choices in the attempts to see a new ending. It all becomes greatly repetitive and takes far more time than it otherwise might had you been given more freedom in the number of saves you have, as well as making it quicker to skip through dialog you've already read before.But ultimately it's a somewhat inconsequential complaint as for those not obsessed with seeing every ending, the first run through the story isn't the least bit affected and just as captivating as ever. Least I forget Cinders is also remarkably pretty to look at, with fantastic art and a ton of minor details bringing the picture to life, from background objects to character expressions. It's a bold new direction for visual novels, a genre that's been stagnant and underrepresented outside of Japan for a long time, and a brilliant first attempt by developer MoaCube which I hope is but the first of many more to come.

												Cinders is a visual novel solid in every way and that's rare.First of all, it's gorgeous. I'm not teaching anything if you already glanced at the screenshots but it needs to be said because it's actually pretty important. Many visual novels have a cheap look, and I personally feel that it has a really negative impact on my enjoyment of the story. In Cinders you want to move forwards just to see the next picture.But it's not just window dressing either. The writing is also great, and I do mean it. All the characters and situations are believable, the premise was enough to hook me in and the world is an interesting place to discover. It's nice for a change to play something that you never did before when many visual novels are pretty iterative.Finally, the choices. Nothing to write home about, but they are there and they are significant. I actually prefer something that really allows me to put my mark on the story rather than thousands of endings for the sake of it. It's good and having the opportunity to twist such an iconic story is a great pleasure.To conclude, this game is amazing. Maybe even one of those niche games good enough to be enjoyed by someone who usually don't play them.A little caveat nonetheless: despite all my praises, I think the price is too steep. Wait for a sale.			"

My opening statement:Cinders is pretty good visual novel.I think this is all you need to know at this point.I like when familiar stories are reimagined, authors and creators give them they own flair and taste, and it worked in Cinders. Story feels fresh, you can like (love would be strong term) and hate characters, and for 3 hours it grabs you and you want to see how the story ends. Happily ever after or miserable till death.Art is simply fantastic, i am big fan of it. Music could have been better. There is nothing specific for what you can be harsh on this game and if you want me to cherry picking some stuff; I was surprised when i saw 16,99€ as a price for Cinders. Holy cow! If i didn't get this game in bundle, i would never ever buy game like this, for price this high.Awesome artwork, good storytelling were reasons to play till the end; but one end only.Grade: CP.S.

												First of all, if you aren't into visual novels this isn't for you. But on the otherhand, if you are then i garuntee you will love it if you play it all the way through. PROS:This game has four different main endings each with a couple different epilogues you can get through the choices you make. I've seen some reviews on here that say the choices don't matter, which i have to disagree with. Every visual novel game will have choices that seem meaingless and pointless and may not exactly contribute to the main story, but they are there to give you a sense of control. Other choices will be vitally important like the first choice you make. It can change the whole story depending on what you choose. Some people are bothered by no voices or terrible music or any other thing that falls under that category, these people will be so pleased with the musical choice the creators went with. It is beautiful and one of my favorite soundtracks of any game i have ever played. It makes the game 10x better in my opinion. Like i said before, there are four main endings each with their own epilogues; if you are one of those gamers that like to get all they can in a game but hesitates because it takes too long, you will be pleased to find that you can skip through all the dialogue so it makes the replay value go up. Another thing to add would be the artwork for this game. It is amazingly beautiful. Most visual novels have static(stay still) artwork that changes when you move forward in the conversation, but this game has dynamic artwork that moves. Granted it is not much but fires flicker, and dust particles in the sunlight are visible. CONS:Saying all this, there are some faults. Not many, but they are there. Some characters seem useless and very unnatural along with some situations. Sometimes the words lag behind if you are running something in the background. There, that's all the cons in my opinion. Time for the assessment.ASSESSMENT:Story: 8Replay Value: 10 Music: 10 Characters: 8Artwork: 10OVERALL: 9.1If you like visual novels, you will thoroughly enjoy this game. "

Cinders is a colorful, emotionally-vibrant Visual Novel, starring Cinders, a wide-eyed, fiery-red, female protagonist. Cinders is about to embark on a journey—a journey of choices. The story will most certainly bring to memory another classical tale of romance, intrigue, betrayal & the pursuit of happiness.Choices are the core gameplay element in Cinders. The choices you make really do matter. The world will unfold around you according to the decisions you make—and you will always be aware of how they affect what occurs next. The gameplay mechanic for this is that a budding branch will emerge from the corner of the screen to denote an event playing out that has been mitigated by previous decisions. This conspires to make a living world, where you’re not an observer but a participant.While choices are at the core of Cinders, they dance around the diverse characters. The characters are complex, disturbed, scarred, & much more. None of the characters are simply good or bad. They reach out and play with your emotions as if they were flesh & blood. The artwork in Cinders is colorful & vibrant. You’ll oftentimes find yourself looking at the background scenery, to catch a look at the swaying shrubbery, or the flickering fire. The soundtrack is diverse & emotionally fitting to each scene as it unfolds. It’s easy to get lost in the simple background melodies.Cinders has a full screen option, with the option to choose screen ratio. The game looked great on a 30” screen at a 16:10 ratio playing in full screen mode.In conclusion, Cinders is loosely based on one of the classics, & most certainly worth a look if you’re interested in the Visual Novel genre. It will make your heart tingle & your nerves race as you take an emotional journey with Cinders.9/10				"

												Such a breathtaking game - the music is lovely, fitting and not irritating, the backgrounds are just beautiful, and the characters are highly detailed and very striking to look at. The dialogue is good - and the choices meaningful. It's a game to simply enjoy - admiring the artwork, the storytelling and the music. This is a visual novel - so there is a lot of reading, but no walls of text, all short dialogue that is easily read without feeling like a chore. It's a great introduction to visual novels as the re-telling of Cinderella, it's a story that most will be familiar with - and one that breaks away from the more common Japanese based visual novels which can be a bit heavier going. Worth full price, definitely worth grabbing on sale or in a bundle. I can't wait for the next game from this publisher to appear.			"

												I admit I'm new to the visual novel scene, but as a starting point, I found Cinders to be very satisfying. The art is gorgeous (especially backgrounds!) and chock full of effects. It also makes me happy that the relationships between the female characters are the crux of the story - the stepmother and Cinder's sisters are complex characters, neither good nor evil; Cinder's behavior towards them brings out other sides to them, and lead to different futures. It also pleased me that the endings aren't entirely depended on whom Cinders falls in love with - they're about her choices for her future and who she wants to be in life. A hot guy can come along if he wants, sure. But Cinders is more than just a vehicle for player romance, she's a young woman looking for her path in life, for better or for worse. It was a pleasurable experience with lovely visuals, and I'm really looking forward to the team's next game, which looks like it will be even better.			"

												Although it is a retelling of the classic fairytale Cinderella, the new approach makes it seem like another story altogether.Genre: Fantasy/AdventureDuration: 2 to 3 hours for one ending; 10 to 15 hours for all endings.Developed by: MoaCube, 2012By playing as the namesake protagonist, you are introduced to a fantasy world in which you must deal with your stepmother and stepsisters at first, later meeting nobility, fairies, salesmen and townsfolk. You do so through choices and map movement intermissions in the narrative. So as not to leave you confused, the game flashes a wooden branch icon on the upper right corner of the screen everytime a previous choice is showing its consequence.Cinders is structured so as to give your choices an aspect of freedom: there are not correct choices and you will always reach a satisfying ending that reflects your behaviour throughout the story. This means one single playthrough will last for about two hours, but one ending is just a glimpse of the stories Cinders has to offer.The greatest strength this visual novel has is probably its characters: no character is completely redeemed nor degraded. They are complex, round characters with motivations and goals that you can relate yourself to, enhancing the moral aspect of the choices: each and every character has a lot to be explored, making for a consistent world with strong characters - and many strong female characters - and a sense that you are free to make your own judgement. This groundedness, however, doesn't stop the game from sporting a most pleasant fairytale atmosphere. The art and the music, through coherent design and stylistic choices, gives Cinders a fine identity and a unique feel down to minute details, such as small animations on the background and on the sprites. As such, it's easy to get used to the art style even if it's not commonly used in visual novels. Such attention to identity helps in the establshment of an emotional link between you and Cinders' world.If only fow how bold it is, Cinders is a must for anyone who appreciates story-driven experiences with complex characters and a lot of room for the player to decide what happens next.Positive:*Great fairytale impression*Many choices and many endings*Fleshed out characters*Music is comfortable to listen to and the sound design is adequate*Consistent art and worldNegative:*Short playthroughs. You might not feel the need to see other endings/epilogues*Though the game shows when a choice is reflected on the progress of the story, some choices are still lost in perspective*It's expensive			"

												Despite the idea and the setting, Cinders is NOT a fairytale story about mistreated girl getting her happy love ending  with the help of fairy godmother. Sure, there is a fairy, there is a ball, there is a Prince, there is a lost slipper (altough it's not a glass one, and she didn't really lose it...).What you get here instead, is a story about dealing with your broken family. Both, your Stepmother and your Stepsisters have developed troubled personalities hidden under masks of the roles they trying (or are simply forced) to fullfil, and it's up to you to chose what kind of ""happy ending"" do you want to get, not only for yourself, but also for your family. Will you try to work things out together and help them develop? Or will you destroy them, to get what you want? Or maybe you'll run away from everything and search for your Happy Ending somewhere else? Or maybe you'll become someone you used to despised yourself? Even though the story is set in stricte fairytale world, it portrays MODERN issues of many dysfunctional families out there. And that I find the biggest attraction of this game, along with very beautiful aesthetics. On the downside... The game felt like it lacked some more individual panels to look at (as this is what the gameplay is all about- to look at lovely pictures and read a story you can influence with the choices of your own ). Possible romance options could have been developed much further ( 'cmon! You give us 3 handsome dudes and make us lick the window instead of touching the shinies >.< ! ). And unfortunately,  there is no voice-acting, at all. All this makes me feel that 15,99€ is way to expensive for the content it offers. Even though, I still give Cinders thumbs up \o/. "

												What initially drew me to Cinders was the combination of the female protagonist, visual novel category, and the lovely artwork. From the looks of it, Cinders seemed like it would be a wonderful game, and it definitely delivered! I just started my second playthrough, and I have been loving every minute of gameplay.First, I absolutely must rave about the gorgeous art by Gracjana Zielinska! The character designs were unique and stunning, and the backgrounds were lavish and interesting. I loved how little details would appear or move in the background - that gave the graphics a ""little something"" extra to catch the eye! I could not get enough of the beautiful visuals and tried to research if she had done work on other games. I found out about Solstice, a mystery thriller visual novel coming soon, and Phantasmat, a hidden objects game. I am much more into visual novels, but the artwork alone is compelling me to give Phantasmat a chance also!Second, the gameplay placed player choice front and center, and especially in a visual novel, I appreciated this greatly. Choices were frequent and truly affected the story; the ""Rewards"" section from the game's menu lets you see how many of the variants you've explored to the ending, and in my ending, I've only explored 25% so far, so there is still a lot for me to experience! I did do some saving/loading to see what would happen with certain choices and was very pleased with the level of difference I discovered. In addition, certain choices add adornments to the menu page - this made game progress even more exciting because I wanted to see what else would be added where. :) ... and it brought out the completionist in me! I am excited to unlock all the endings and as many variants as I can.Third, the characters were unpredictably rich. Coming into a fairytale-inspired game, I expected the same character tropes, but while the characters were similarly-situated, they were far deeper than the superficial Cindarella cast I was used to! Cinders, for example, can be played to be quite pragmatic, or pig-headed, or honest, or devious, or a mix of the aforementioned, and based on my ending, I think the choice of these traits truly affects the outcome of the game. Madame Ghede was a favorite character of mine - I wanted to know so much more about her! She was enigmatic and wise, revealing a hint of the effects of what seemed to me a very detailed life. The stepmother (Carmosa) and step-sisters (Sophia and Gloria) were also multi-faceted, and there was more than meets the eye to Captain Perrault, as well.The game's soundtrack suited it perfectly -- it was not overbearing, but rather complementary. Chimes indicated decisions, and subtle pieces (like at the Lake) would round out an enchanting experience. I wish the soundtrack had been included in a bundle because it would be a wonderful way to relax. :)If you like visual novels, female protagonists, gorgeous artwork, fairytales, lots of choice that affects the ending, and a hint of romance, I highly recommend this game. If you adore Gracjana Zielinska's artwork (like I now do), you should also check out the upcoming visual novel from the same developer (Moacube) Solstice and the hidden objects game from Big Fish, Phantasmat. Enjoy!			"

												I originally had this game on my wishlist based on the art style alone. Turns out, it's a re-imagining of the tale of Cinderella. And it is a visual novel, where your choices have an actual impact on the story.Graphics / art - 5/10Let me get this out of the way since this is what first pulled me in. Mmmm ... not that impressive at the end of the day. Most of the characters look a little weird, and there's just not much animation. I know it's a visual novel, but it feels like they could have done a little more. So it's not bad, just not quite up to its potential in this area.Story / characters - 8/10The story itself is slightly adapted, and I have to say the developers did a great job. The wicked stepmother and the two evil stepsisters are actual characters with personalities, and through the story you can understand some of the reasons why they behave as they do. Truly a tremendous spin on a stale old tale.The developers also get into why there is a ball, which is pretty interesting.The most annoying character is probably Cinders herself. In some ways she behaves like any normal person in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation would. However, other times she's a bit whiny and preachy.My favorite character was actually the stepmother. She's less of a demon when you get to know her reasoning and motivations. And her drive is impressive.The side characters beyond the main ones (Cinders and her step-family being the core characters), are less interesting, and it seems like there are some interesting mysteries into their backgrounds that unfortunately don't get fleshed out. Like what the relationship is between Cinder's mother and some of the other side characters. What happened to Cinder's mother?Gameplay - 10/10As with most visual novels, it's mostly reading. However, at key points you get to make decisions. I wish I had read about the game before playing to better appreciate the impact of decisions. It would have let me know how important it is to use all of your (I think) 10 save slots so that you don't have to restart the story from the beginning to find all the endings.Basically, you can be good, neutral or evil based on your decisions. And your decisions impact your route to the ball, which suitor you end up with, and whether you're even happy at the end. I overwrote a lot of my old saves as I went along, so I was really limited in my endings. However, I think there are a total of about 12 variations.Pretty incredible, eh? The game itself isn't amazing, but when you realize how the developers freshened up the source material, you can't help but be impressed!8/10			"

												I consider Cinders to be a much mature and enhanced version of one of our most beloved childhood fairy tales, Cinderella. The story is not predictable at all, in fact Cinders has multiple endings and a large number of possibilities. Your decisions affect the gameplay and throughout several playthroughs  you discover different facets of the same idea: your life is a story which only you are able to write.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

												Out of all the VNs I've played on Steam, this one takes the cake. It has a lot more content, variation, and depth compared to most other titles and it's an interesting take on Cinderella. The choices are not limited to A or B and the multiple variations per ending add a nice twist for those who enjoy somewhat specific/customized paths. The art is also very beautiful. That's a huge deal for some people so I'm glad that it was the first thing about this game to captivate me.5/5. It's a solid VN.			"

												Cinders are basically just Cinderella story that you know it well.However, in this game, it tell another different story and it all depend on you to turn Cind to be.Mean Cind that want her house back from Stepmother, Or just a normal girl who just show up at the ballroom and Prince just like her opinion and want her to be the Queen. It never be like an old Cinderella that we know, Anastasia and Drizella are not be like the old one, here they more friendly and reasonable, which I really love it. There nothing more than just a book story that need you to read, but the good one is that you can choose what in the end that you would like it to be. Recommend, if you love Cinderella story :)			"

												Cinders is a realistic retelling of the classic Cinderella story. It's like a visual novel with a whole lot of reading (obviously), but it also gives you a choice from time to time. Choices that affect the story. As a result there are several endings to be unlocked, and a single playthrough can take anywhere between 3-5 hours I think. The art is done remarkably well, even if the faces lack of bit of character and the whole thing feels very polished. Except for a few typos, that is. I would recommend it to everyone who knows the story or just likes reading. But please note that it's not so much a game, but more of an interactive book. There's very little input required. And let's not forget about the price which is absurdly high. So for now I suggest waiting for a sale.[Rating: 73/100]			"

												This game was a delightful surpise! After reading the reviews before purchasing I was unsure about what to except!What I got!:Beautiful graphics!Intriguing and depth filled characters!Alot of options and replay value!Some people comment that they don't like the complexity of the options, but I find this a refreshing change to many visual novels that have romance options. Not only is Cinders a very unique twist on the Cinderella story, it also dives into intense topics like human morality, duty and fate. We truly get to decide for ourselves what we want in this story and choose how we wish to behave right till the end. There is a lot of philisophical discussions taking place and all options are never shown as being 'right' or 'wrong', but simply different. It's a very realistic and humble way to portay the ways in which we actually make decisions.I had a great time and plan to replay it a few more times to get different endings (have only played once through as I'm writing this).Excellent game and balanced options!After playing multiple endings:My review still stands. If not more so! The variances in the different endings are very satisfying and not cookie cutter or cliche in the slightest! Definitely worth a few different playthroughs.			"

												Do you want to pay money for a game with an underlying narrative about how abusers are kinda right and abuse victims should feel bad for taking appropriate action?  No amount of witty dialogue could cover up the inherently bad-- and at times disturbing-- game writing.  The game promised to add character depth to a familiar story, and it did-- to a point.  The stepsisters have a dynamic consistent with being raised by a manipulative, abusive mother who plays them against each other.  Lady Carmosa, the stepmother, is emotionally abusive in a realistic way.  Like many abusive people, she makes sure to micromanage the people that she's abusing, put them down, and try tell them constantly that they need her to treat them this way because of how pitiful/stupid/etc. they are.  Cinders mentions in the dialogue that she believes that Lady Carmosa is capable of killing, and it's implied in Carmosa's dailogue that she may have killed her second husband, so she represents a physical danger as well.There's a point in the dialogue where Cinders is speaking to someone who knew her late mother.  It has already been established that her stepmother is abusive.  Cinders explains that she believes that she-- not her stepmother-- is the legal inheritor of the family estates.  I chose the option for wanting to get an attorney to get my house back.  Mom's friend promptly gave me a guilt trip about the ""consequences"" of such a harsh act when my stepmother was just keeping the family fortune together.  You know, the family fortune that wasn't even legally hers that she's only using to benefit herself.  Given the more realistic take on abuse dynamics that the writers had so far, I figured that this was intentional.  Abuse victims often hear similar things from third parties about why their husband/parent/etc. isn't such a bad person and they should be grateful.  I waited for the protagonist to have an opportunity to confront this clearly inappropriate behaviour.Nope.  Wasn't happening.Every time the option for getting an attorney to get my (expletive) house back came up, I clicked it.  Every time, I got an NPC guilt trip and dialogue to make sure that I knew that-- although there are officially no wrong choices in this game-- I had made a wrong choice.  Bad, BAD player wanting people to get stolen property back from their abuser through appropriate legal channels.  How could I!  No matter how many times you choose that option, you will not have the opportunity to seek legal assistance to get the family house which you believe you're the legal inheritor of back.  There's also this little bit of talking to herself that Cinders has about how she's materially better off than most of the women in town so maybe she should be grateful for the life that her stepmother has given her.  You know, because if an abusive person takes our stuff we should be grateful to the abuser for what they've deigned to give us.I played through the game just to be sure that there wasn't, you know, some upcoming branch in which the game would deal with the mess it made.  Nope.  It's sure as hell not getting a second play through.			"

												Cinders is one of my all-time favorites.  I've played it a few times over the past couple years - whenever I feel like being whisked away into this magical, yet very realistic, fairytale world, and it never fails to make me smile.  It's always the first game I recommend to my friends that like choice driven VNs or fairytales.The scenes are beautifully drawn in a sort of pastel style with vibrant colors to help set the mood.  The music is good too and very immersive.  Most importantly, the story is well-written.  The language can be a bit over-wrought at times, but that just adds to the old fairytale/literature feel.There are quite a few ways the story can go, depending on your choices, and it's not always clear which choice made the diffference, but that's part of the charm for me.  It's not necessarily about where you wind up (it's definitely possible to get an unsatisfying ending), but about the journey of how you got there.  Each time I play, I feel like I learn something new about the characters and the world.  There were actually whole storylines I didn't even know existed on my first playthrough that made it pretty fun to play again.  Most of the characters are pretty intricate and more than willing to give you their soliliquy on life if you prod them the right way... or offer you a brutally scathing retort if you don't.  A few of them are really funny too!  Best of all, Cinders, herself, is a pretty relatable and empowering character with her own quirks and insecurities.  I could definitely see myself in her shoes (or glass slippers) if I lived in her fairy world.  Thanks to this game, I can imagine that I really am for a little while.			"

												I'm not usually a fan of visual novels but this is pretty neat. There is beautiful art and the characters are engaging and fully fleshed out - you don't really think of one as a jerk they all just have different motives in life like human beings. Choices matter and there are several different realistic endings. The only negative I found is there wasn't a 'skip' button I could find. Which made achievement hunting a bit tiresome. But buy it, it has replay value at least twice through. If you replay it a lot of the dialogue will be the same but, the endings are so different.			"

The various endings for the game were quite interesting, though I would recommend to save before choices as in any VN, to avoid  having to repeat some dialogue. The characters were well defined and their interactions were quite interesting, especially Cinders and Sophia. It's a breath of fresh air especially seeing Cinderella not being portrayed as a Mary Sue.  In short, it's a gorgeous game that really can be considered as beautiful piece of artwork.			"

												Cinders is a visual novel that is based on the fairy tale we all know, Cinderella, and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of playing it. It's certainly no fabricated Disney setup though, as it has a more mature take on the story, some of which involve politics, psychological wounds, social discrimination, etc., but still retains the light-hearted feeling of fantasy from the original.Pros: The lovely, rustic art style, one of the first things to catch my attention: a right mix of dark and heavy, as well as stunning, colorful fairy tale scenery, which creates the perfect atmosphere for the story's theme The music is a masterpiece, from the sound effects to the background music that plays on each scene: lovely to listen to, yet not too overwhelming to distract you from your immersion Beautiful dialogue you wouldn't want to skip, with just enough suspense that can't make you stop reading The subtle animations, from the way the flowers would sway to the wind, etc A handful of amazing characters, well-written so you could actually sympathize with them, even the antagonists The variety of choices given to you, and the many, multiple endings you could choose to unfold with them: high replay value because of this, you could be a charming and innocent Cinders in one playthrough, and a deviously cunning one the next As with most VNs, involves romance options, but is written so well that it makes said options neither a necessity nor the main driving force of the story, but only as a 'side quest', and focuses more on heavier themes More than enough endings: you are left with four main endings, as well as many different sub-endings under each one Provides you with a hefty amount of hours to complete, or read from start to end Has a feature wherein you can skip through parts you have already read, to explore the different outcomes Easy to obtain achievements, got to 100% in no timeCons: Some of the dialogues are... For lack of a better term, awkward, and a few moments are too cringe-worthy cliché Lack of, or rushed character development: pacing feels off somehow, and it gives you a feeling that everything is happening too fast Typos in some dialoguesThis is the first visual novel I have played, finished to the very end and tried to get all possible endings I can. For people like me who are not that fond of anime VNs, and have a particular interest in similar themes, this game is definitely worth trying out. Can't wait to try out other VNs from MoaCube~Overall Rating:8.5/10			"

												I have a pretty soft spot for Cinders. It’s one of the few games I bought after extensively… “Researching” whether it was worth the money. As far as western visual novels go, this one is simply great. It has believable, likeable characters – even the “villains” can be sympathized with, a great main character that evolves with your choices, and an overall plot that manages to provide meaningful choices despite being seemingly linear. It might be a bit pricey for the amount of playtime available, but it’s certainly quality playtime.  "

												This is a very short VN. I paid 1/2 the normal price and was still disappointed with the amount of content. I have several hours on this game because I don't shut down games while I'm doing other stuff (I get distracted easily).There are 8 main endings with various insignificant changes to those endings (such as whether your sisters like you or not, etc.) That being said if you can get it in a deal or bundle it is visually very high quality and an interesting take on the fairy tale. I would highly recommend at a much lower price only due to amount of content not the quality of content. "

												I love this game... I bought it in the Summer Sale and haven't stopped playing it since. I'm trying to play it until I have unlocked all the endings ... and there are alot of endings you can achieve (check out Cinders Wiki for a full list of the endings but warning spoilers) I have even gone as far as to create an excel spreadsheet that has every choice that I have made in each of my games so I can work out what I have already done in simular games to make sure I can unlock a different ending each time I play it... I know, anal right? But I'm loving this game at the moment. As you can see from the images previewed for this game, the art work is really beautiful, unlike some Visual novel games you see on the market that are drawn badly. The writing is really good also...havent found any spelling errors yet. The music in this game is really good too... so good that I had to purchase the download for the OST of Cinders and I love it... really good. It all works really well together and a lot of fun re-playing the game to try and get the different endings and achievements. This is the best visual novel game that I have played and I would love it if Moacube could create another fairytale Visual novel game like this one although they have just annouced a new game called 'Solstice' on Greenlight so if you like Cinders you should vote on Greenlight for Solstice.

												10/10Everyone knows the story so it's unique in the way that you have have a vague understanding of what's to come and this has a big impact on how you play the game. I can't quite recall playing a adventure game before where you know already what is going to happen. End result is a surreal experience - It's like replaying a game you have already completed in your mind and then the end result and journey there is something entirely different. Nice details on the main characters are worthy of special praise: Stepmother and sisters being the best characters in awhile in just about any adventure game. Disney pictured them as monsters. This game gives them a much more humane form. High production values and good graphics and soundtrack ensures a smooth game experience. Multiple endings for replayability and you get a whole new perspective to the other main characters in the original fairy tale. Best in it's genre this far.			"

I should mention that I purchased it directly from Moa when it was first released and they kindly gave me a Steam key when it was released on Steam.  The story is a familiar one: you are Cinderella and you have to decide how the events play out.  How will she/you react to your stepmother's machinations?  Will you tell her off or be meek?  Do you love the prince for himself or do you just want to increase your social stature?  Do you fall in love with a childhood friend instead of the prince?  Do you choose no one at all?The graphics are flat-out gorgeous.  The art is lush, vibrant, and full of life.  Replayability is high due to the vast number of choices you can make.  I've finished one playthrough and am currently playing again to try some of the other options.  In the original version I had some issues with crashing and saves not actually saving and in one instance I had to completely restart, but these issues seem to have been fixed in the Steam version as I have not experienced any crashing/lockups/etc.Take a look at the screenshots and if you're even remotely intrigued, get this game.  You won't be disappointed.			"

												Now this is a VN worth paying the full price: the art style, BG, BGM were simply amazing. I can’t stress how much I liked, it’s just so good. I hope that the developers can make a DLC of the soundtrack someday too.I really liked the “mature” tone used on this fairytale. I’d like to see more stories like that, definitely. The story was good, and the characters were nice. A few scenes were a bit silly in my opinion (like Carmosa’s death lol), but it’s ok.10/10. Keep up the good work!			"

												I'm not much for Visual Novels, or multiple choice.  Never really found them very fun to play.But for some reason, I actually quite like Cinders.Not even sure what it is that makes me like this game.But it is indeed a very nice VN.  I can certainly recommend this game.			"

												The good :-Animated backgrounds-Good overall character design-Work has been done on the story branchingThe bad :-The writing feels uninspired-Same for the character design-Nothing really memorable in the soundtrackThe ugly :-The character animations are uncanny,i'd rather have no animations than that.I got this in a weekly bundle.If you are interested in a light novel to read in the train or something,it might interest you,but it is in no way a masterpiece.I appreciate the effort on the story branching though,it really is something that has been lost in videogames long ago.

												I recieved Cinders as a gift, and it has become one of my favorite visual novels of the year. The story follows that of Cinderella in a more mature light. The art and soundtrack is stunningly beautiful. It has an overall touching story, and I found myself able to eventually understand each of the characters despite the limited interactions. I can't possibly say that there are any cons.			"

												Amazing game, and I say that as someone who doesn't normally play visual novels because: a) they are usually drawn in the style of anime, and b) they are usually dating sims -- I find neither of those two things particularly appealing. This game, however, is not even close to being a dating sim (although there are different romance options you can choose to pursue) and the art style is miles away from anime and very beautiful.The story is a retelling of the Cinderella fairytale with a lot more depth, featuring well-rounded characters, complicated familial relations and meaningful choices. It emphasizes the extent to which characters' personal choices are limited by/the product of their circumstances and surroundings. The wicked stepmother and stepsisters are not simple archetypal chracters but complex figures with motivations and agendas that arise from their life circumstances. The main character Cinders, the young woman who lives as a servant in her own house, is trying to take destiny in her own hands and break free from her current circumstances, but cannot do so without outside help. The game makes a point: despite her desire to be independent and have agency, her available options are nevertheless to some extent the product of particular conditions that are outside of her influence (of her father marrying as he did, of her mother ensuring Cinders gets help when she needs it, etc). The writting is very good and the choices in the game are meaningful; I found replaying the game to explore different results very interesting. The first playthrough takes about 3 hours, while subsequent playthroughs can be made a lot shorter as there's an option to skip through dialogues that you've read in previous playthroughs. Definitely recommended for people who love good stories and don't mind reading a bunch.			"

												Игра не для фанатов экшена, шутера или что либо в этом роде, в игре ставка больше сделана на сюжет и на решения которые влияют на сюжет, и которые влияют на то как рассказываеться. Похожа на TWD но с разными концовками и без экшена, картинки в половине-2D/3D но не  сильно статическиеThis game is not for fans of action or FPS or something like this. In the game, the main bet is placed on the story and storytelling and on the decisions that you make, which do change the story and storytelling. Simillar to the TWD but with different endings and without actions, pictures in half 2D/3D but not very static 10/10			"

												I have played games similar to this one so when I first saw it I was very excited! I have tried it and I have to say that I'm slightly disapointed with the experience. I mean, don't get me wrong, the game itself is quite nice, it has wonderful artwork, the characters and scenario are very well made but, to me, it just lacks a few touches that would make it even more special. One of the things that really bothered me right from the start was the awful sound you get when the text is being shown. After awhile it almost feels like needles in your brain! Since I couldn't take it I turned it off and to my surprise there wasn't a single alternative other than pure silence. Like I mentioned before, I have played similar games and most of them have someone reading the lines, which makes it less boring and easy on the eyes. I mean, lets face it, having to read several lines from beginning to end can get extremely boring after awhile. Especially since most people will have to do multiple playthroughs and the game doesn't offer a proper way of skipping the lines you already read. Yes, you have the option to re-read the previous line but you can't skip to the next. You can click several times to make the text appear a bit faster but imagine doing that, pretty much, from beginning to end...I believe the game should have other small touches such as background noises. For example, when we have the outdoor scenes it would be nice to have the sound of birds, wind, etc; when attending the ball at the palace we could have music playing, people talking or when Cinders is at home, in her room the sound of the fire in the fireplace. Those little details, apart from having different people reading the characters lines would make this game better and interesting than it already is. Plus, I believe it would help justify its price. To be completely honest with you, and even though I recommend it, don't buy it unless you can get it cheap.			"

												I have 16+ hours on this 2 hour game, so I guess I enjoyed it. :PCinders is a very thoughtful and breathtakingly beautiful visual novel. The characters are a bit more self aware and philosophical than people are in real life, breaking the immersion a little. However, I am a drama geek who is a huge fan of monologues that don't sound exactly natural. Fiction lets us bend the rules a little. Get in characters head on a deeper level. So I enjoyed the game and all of the thought bubbles it triggered. Definitely life changing if you let it get under your skin.A quote from Mattie Brice which explains why I'm so in love with this game and this team: ""There’s such little material out there to help me reflect on certain aspects of my life, both to feel heard and then responded to, providing catharsis or temporary motions for healing.""

												This game got my attention since the moment I started playing it. I fell literally in love with it. The art is simply beautiful, present screenshots can't give it justice. You have to experience it yourself; the atmosphere is so immersive you feel like you are part of a fable. (Fullscreen suggested) Awesome aesthetics, relaxing gameplay, amazing characters. Fairy tale-like, yet so realistic. Cinders is based upon Cinderella, yet, well written characters will result easily relatable. Each personage is accurately described and presents interesting personality. In this game you play as Cinders; a young lady sharing roof with her stepmother and two stepsisters. Due to circumstances you find yourself in an inconvenient situation with unhealthy lifestyle, but it won't make you bring yourself down. You'll be reminded of how real life actually is and if you want to achieve something you need to stand up for yourself. No matter how sad your circumstances are, it's just another challenge that you can overcome.I bought this game during Steam sales and I am really happy with my purchase. I wish there would've been more background story coming to side characters, but that's just a small whim of mine. Nothing to complain about. 8.6/10			"

												Oof. I know that I bought this on sale, but I can't remember what I paid for it -- regardless, it was too much. I'm into story-rich, choice-driven, female-led games (e.g. Life is Strange), so this one kept showing up in my recommendations. I finally pulled the trigger. I'm immediately filled with regret. I'm an obsessive completist, and I can't even bring myself to finish this. The gameplay feels so passive and slow, and the writing is so terrible -- *especially* the dialogue. I can't even imagine having the patience to get through a single playthrough, much less the several required to experience all potential storylines. The only thing I can recommend here is the graphics -- they're gorgeous. Sadly (maybe because I'm on Windows 10), the game kept on hanging while transitioning between areas, meaning I didn't even get to enjoy those gorgeous graphics without a couple of force-restarts. What a shame. The idea and the look is so great -- the execution just didn't pay off for me.			"

												I've only gotten one ending so far, but this is definitely one of the best games I've purchased on Steam and probably even one of the best games I've played all year. I was intrigued by the synopsis on the game's page, and it definitely lives up to all the lofty goals its set for itself. This game isn't just a spin on Cinderella - it's much more than that. The story seems to take a lot of interesting turns no matter what you want the outcome to be. The variations on endings depending on the choices you make is really cool; I wish more games used a system like it. But, even with an interesting story, this game may have been pretty bland if the characters were just ripped from the fairy tale. Luckily, that's not the case. All of the characters are more than they appear at first glance; they all have well-defined, complex personalities.I would have gladly paid full-price for this game, and I am definitely going to explore it more.

												Originally I thought this would be another 'click around' yawnfest of a fairy tale. It's surprisingly not.The plot is different and more grown-up, the decisions are more complex and are not obvious 'good' or 'bad' ones but shades of grey. On the downside, since all games have downsides, if you are a fast reader like myself you may get frustrated at the amount of time text takes to get on the screen. I've clicked through hundreds of text windows to finish this game.It's not something I'll return to often, as it *is* an interactive book, but the next time Skyrim crashes on me I'll give it another go.

												Gorgeous VN, providing a nice variation from the mainly anime style VNs available. The character designs are beautiful, they are also pleasingly expressive for the amount of detail on each of them. (I'd gladly buy a poster of madame Ghede or the fairy to hang on my wall, if one were available :L) The backgrounds are wonderfully atmospheric, particularly around the fairies' lake, perfect for the fairytale story it's based on. The music also attributes to this atmosphere setting the tone for each scene.The characters are enjoyable, the opportunity to work with Cinders' step-family was a nice variation to the original story. Cinders also stood out as she was a very likeable protagonist, with a lot of personality. The major con of this game is it's length, there are relatively few endings, it would have been nice to see more possible love interests/lifestyle paths for Cinders as a lot more of it is based on who is allied with her at the end and whether she is good, or bad. You can finish most, if not all, endings in one sitting, so it, unfortunately, has little replay value story-wise.Overall, I'd recommend Cinders as a beautiful and atmospheric experience, utilising it's game qualities to enhance the events taking place. My only wish is that there were more events.TLDR: atmospheric & beautiful art, with interesting characters, but is relatively short/has fewer endings than most other VNs.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game — although it would perhaps more accurately be described as a 'choose your own adventure' novel, of the kind I loved when I was a child. You are given enough choice to influence the game and feel as though you have control over your own fate, but not so many choices as to make each individual choice feel meaningless or to ruin the narrative structure.After finishing it the first time, I loaded a little while back and tried to try out some other choices, and was initially very disappointed — it felt that no matter what I chose, there were very few endings open to me, and they were virtually identical. It wasn't until I started again from the beginning that I realised this wasn't because my choices were meaningless, but because all my previous choices and developed the world in such a way that those outcomes were the only realistic consequences of the character I constructed in the situation I placed her in.On the whole, if you don't like Virtual Novels, you won't like this one. If you're looking for something a bit more 'gamey', like Long Live the Queen, this will probably be too simplistic for you. But if you like reading, even if you were never into 'choose your own adventure' stories, this is probably worth picking up.Game-play aside, the game is ~gorgeous~ and the music lovely. Several of the backgrounds are in my desktop wallpaper rotation they're that pretty.			"

												An excellent visual novel with an interesting re-imagining of the Cinderella fairytale. The story's short, but it does give you plenty of chances to alter the way that story unfolds. And however short it may be, the story really cannot be complimented enough for its quality. There aren't any CGs, which is to say unique graphics illustrating special moments, but the general artwork is more than good enough to make up for that.All in all, if you're a fan of visual novels, this is definitely worth playing.

												Cinders is very much an interactive novel more than it is a game. By biggest gripe is that whilst you do make choices that can alter the storyline and the ending, there isn't much variation aside from a few scenes playing out differently and a different set of text showing up for the ending 'cutscene'.But other than that it is a well crafted title. The art work is good and unlike similar games the characters have some (albeit limited) animation. Since you will probably play through the game multiple times there is a very useful function that allows you to quickly skip through dialogue you have already seen, stopping at anything that is new and at any choice you have to make.If you are a fan of reading and fairy tales you will probably enjoy the game. If a wall of text sends you in to a fit of rage then you should probably avoid this one. Overall I'd give it a thumbs up.			"

												This interactive adventure caught my interest, initially because it did not have manga graphics; It has enough different choices to provide for some different outcomes or at least tweaks/versions of the handful of coded outcomes; the storyline is overall romance driven. Situations and consequences end up lacking some shades of grey, but then, which choice based game is not a bit black and white? Whether you like fairy tales that blossom in royal weddings, hopeless romances that overcome social judgement and class differences, arranged marriages brewed in cynical logics and fueled by a drive for advancement, you are likely to find a natural flow of answers that fit your virtual inclination. There is replayability to satisfy curiosity, though it comes encumbered by some medium lengths carved in stone events and dialogues, so that will eventually dry out. For the time curiosity lasts, a very enjoyable chose your path game, well worth a first try and a couple more run throughs.So why play this game?: you d like to see the face of the cinderella in you who does not speak her name.

												MoaCube* has broken an arm, leg, thigh--heck, let's throw in hands too while we're at it. Praise to the writers in this project. Because of them, my expectations for visual novels have been a little more quenched.  The writing is ridiculously good compared to all visual novels.  Great quotes. A lot of time has been put in each choice point. Most of the time, the ""better choice"" is not clear or possible-there may be more than one. It's pretty fast pace.  The story quality is on par with Jisei/Kansei/Yousei in that aspect. A bit slow towards the end though. FYI This is NOT a game stressed as a dating sim. Your choices will give you an ending that doesn't really stress on the ""person"" you are with but rather, your final situation.  Finally, a huge applause to the art, music, and animation (lip/eye movements to background animation).  MoaCube* has really outdone themselves on this project.  A must play.			"

												PROS- Cinders's personality is up to the player via dialogue choices--> Consistency is rewarded, while random personality choices don't serve as well- The art is beautiful, from the backgrounds to the characters- Morality is ambiguous, unlike what you expect from fairy tales- 4 different endings, all with many variations- The dialogue flows well and is interesting to follow- The stepsisters and stepmother are relatable, vulnerable people with real problems- Branches in the storyline feel like they matter for the events that happen no matter what- Two different forces of magic can help Cinders for the ball--> Both have a connection with Cinders's mother and provide different background info respectively- All the characters have issues to work out, the relationships Cinders makes from the player choices feel like they develop in a realistic way; nothing feels forced, like in the fairy tale- 3 different goals for Cinders, not just marrying the prince and living happily ever after- 3 different love interests- Can re-watch endings and variations after you unlock them, very high replay value- Skip function for dialogue you have already read- No tedious stat building!! :)CONS- Cinders's name... It's a bit difficult to take a scene seriously sometimes when characters call her ""Cinders""- The game doesn't tell you what personality you have stacked or what progress your relationships are...so sometimes it's hard to know how to progress and confusing if a certain dialogue option doesn't work--> Leads to lots of trial and error- Failing to get the variation you want can be a bit frustrating for completionists- The music isn't too memorable- No homosexual romances, all 3 love interests are male- No customization of how Cinders looks- No voicesThis is a wonderful, extensive visual novel and possibly one of the best I've ever played. I've always criticized Cinderella as a character for being one of the most passive protagonists in the history of fairy tales, but in this game you can make her to be the woman you always wanted her to be. She also doesn't always have to marry the prince and sometimes the ending isn't going to be happy. You could even die and have no one mourn over you. The possibilities are vast, giving it lots of replay value. All the art is gorgeous to look at as well so oftentimes I just stop reading and take in the scene.The developers were right in advertising this game as a ""mature"" take on the fairy tale, as all the characters are ambiguous. You can never truly figure each of them out and most of the time, they will surprise you. The game does a wonderful job of consistently claiming that no one is so simple as ""good"" or ""evil"" and even the kingdom is going through a metamorphosis if you pay attention to the Prince's plot. Speaking of which, the writing is downright brilliant and atmospheric since it is a western visual novel. There are unfortunately no voices, but little nuances in what the characters say give your imagination plenty to give the characters voices of your own.If you enjoy visual novels with emphasis on dialogue choices, protagonist identity, relationships, and no stat building, definitely buy this game. I hate tedious stat building myself and much prefer making decisions through dialogue. All relationships are accessible provided you have made the choices to develop them; they don't rely on you being ""cute"" enough or ""intelligent"" enough. Despite my glowing recommendation however, Cinders is by no means perfect and I eagerly await anything else the developers have building off of this amazing genre.			"

												Western VN. The writing is terrible: none of the characters talk like real people; main character not only has no personality, but is bad at assuming the motivations of the player choices available (it sounds like someone is telling her what to do and feel through an earpiece, and she forgot to read the script); weak plot motivations. Also, for a game that seems to be trying to tout strong female characterization, the female characters in here sure are huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Not one of them is likable. Issues elsewhere include: only 8 save slots even though you get prompted for a choice every two minutes (filled all my saves in less than 20 minutes), protagonist's dialogue arbitrarily switches from outward conversation to internal narration with absolutely no visual or audio indicators, backgrounds have perspective completely wrong (for it to be right the camera POV would have to be at thigh-height, at least 15 meters away from the characters, which is absurd), no volume adjustment, only 3 text speed settings. The only good things about it are the menu and background animations, which are pretty great, but it's unfortunate that they're wasted on this game.ps: The wandering eyes and some of the expressions are really disturbing sometimes. http://puu.sh/idvkg.jpgpss: Typos. Sometimes even two typos in a single sentence! In a 3+ year old game commercially sold for 17 euros, I remind you. http://puu.sh/ieWDU.jpgpss: Strong independant woman durr http://puu.sh/iduip.jpg http://puu.sh/idu8n.jpg http://puu.sh/ieww1.jpg http://puu.sh/iexiY.jpg http://puu.sh/iexke.jpg http://puu.sh/iexFG.jpg "

												The background art is very pretty, and the story has an interesting 'not everything is black and white' moral - or at least it's interesting until it's been stated over and over and o...ve...zzzPerhaps purchasing 'Cinders' immediately after 'Hatoful Boyfriend' was unfortunate. The 'Cinders' script feels much less elegant in comparison with somewhat clunky, repetitive dialogue with reletively few flags.  'Cinders' is not a terrible VN, but please consider your age and life experience before purchasing!			"

												I like visual novels in general, but this one was pretty lackluster. The part I enjoyed the most was the music. The art style was also quite enjoyable. But the dialog was petty and juvenile and the characters were boring. I won't be playing through it again and would not reccomend it.			"

												'Cinders' is a take on the classic Cinderella story. You decide what direction the story is going by choosing between different options Cinders have in different situations. The game has tons of different endings, I've replayed it five times now and have still not discovered them all. Original characters, beautiful artwork, replayability value - this game is definitely worth your time.I will say, though, that it is not worth it's price. I'd pick it up on a sale. Yes, the game is great, but I don't feel like the price is worth the amount of gameplay you get out of it - even with all its endings. If you like storygames you can steer in your own direction you'll love this game. If you hate reading and have a hard time getting into storylines you'll hate it. It's definitely not a fast paced action game, but it is interesting.			"

												I enjoyed this game and got a number of hours out of it between multiple ending playthroughs (free flow and some with a guide to finish a few missed options).  My one caveat is that you should snag this game on sale or as part of a bundle, as I'm not sure most people will find it justifies its full price.First, you should know that this game is a lot of reading relative to the interaction time.  As the game warns you about in the begining, this is more like a book where you can make some choices to change the ending, rather than a typical point-n-click story where you are making choices constantly.  Luckily, it has a very nice ""fast forward"" option for skipping dialgoue you've already seen on playthroughs, which is something that is lacking in many similar games and is amazingly wonderful if you're hunting down other endings.I like the concept of this game; building my own Cinders' personality and making my own choices and creating my own ending.  I also liked the take on the stepsisters as more than just evil sadists, and actually was fond of Sophie in particular.  It is a nice retake on a fairy tale in a less black & white perspective, especially since you can deivate significantly from the classic tale by making Cinders ""bad"" or reject the prince, etc.The art is also beautiful, although I wish there had been more than a few backdrops, and a few characters whose faces and arms where animated.  I do like that there was some movement and facial expression over static art, just to keep things interesting through a lot of dialgoues boxes with otherwise identical visuals.  But like anything good, I want more than just a small taste of it!The dialgue can be repetative, cliche, and predictible, but I didn't think it was totally awful (there was even a joke about the Captain's belts that genuinely made me laugh out loud).  Could it have been better?  Sure.  Did I find it turn me off from the game?  Nah.  Another review also complained that the writing was too blatant and the foreshadowing too obvious, but I find this preferrable in these types of games, otherwise it is too challenging and uninuititive to guide the story in the direction you desire.  While the choices are not always clear how they will affect the ending and you don't always get exactly what you were aiming for in this game, some opacity makes the gameplay more interesting.  There is a fine balance and I think the game gets it decently well.The one change I would have made to this game would have been to add more frequent interactions with more choices.  They could have been additional conversation selections that were meaningless as far as the outcomes were concerned but valuable in terms of increasing replayability and creating more dynamic character personalities.  I think adding a number of trivial dialogue choices in between the ""important"" decisions would make players feel more engaged, break up the large amounts of reading, and make Cinders feel more realistic to each individual's vision of her.  There are already a huge amount of possibilities in terms of the endings, so I'm hesitant to wishlist for anything that increases those, but it would have been nice to have more options to influence the fates of more people in more ways.Overall, I quite liked this game and am glad I bought and played it.  It might not be the most amazing game ever but it was some hours of enjoyment, which is all I wanted or expected out of it.			"

												Overall, Cinders was a joy to play. Some loveable characters, incredible art, charming music, and a fun retelling of Cinderella.Game Elements: First and foremost, Cinders is a game. It offers many choices to influence the outcome of the game, and the outcomes themselves are varied enough to offer plenty incentive for multiple playthroughs. The skip mode is nicely implemented, as it stops automatically on text you haven't seen before. However, it doesn't really do anything unique for its genre.Story and characters: It's good, but not great. Some fantastic character development with the sisters, but the love interests and the stepmother could use work. ---------------Spoilers Ahead!Carmosa, the stepmother, as you could imagine, treats Cinders deplorably, but we aren't provided with much of a motive as to why she acts this way. Yes, Cinders is not a biological daughter, but that does not preclude Carmosa from treating Cinders with respect. What's more obnoxious about this is that the game writing hints to the player that we should understand Carmosa's actions and respect her for it! It's little things, however, that make this a contradictory stance for the game: Carmosa could have fed her daughters smaller portions of dinner rather than feeding Cinders cold scraps; Carmosa's daughters could wear cheaper dresses so Cinders could wear something other than rags. It does not make sense for Cinders to respect Carmosa in this game unless she forgets the way Carmosa has treated her, and so the Carmosa as advisor ending makes no sense.Gloria and Sophie, however, are excellent characters with natural growth through the course of the game. Gloria is seemingly cruel but just trying to live up to her mother by copying her, and in the way loses herself; Sophie is bitter and cynical because Gloria and her mother constantly criticize her and so her self esteem is ruined. Cinders has the option to help both of them grow in the game by encouraging Gloria to explore her interests and encouraging Sophie to be proud of her intelligence and intellectualism. I was also impressed by their complex relationship with Carmosa, since they loved her for what she's done for them (climbing the social ladder so they could have a better life), but they also resent her for not letting them to be free to do as they wish. It culminates in the Grand Ball, where Sophie ultimately decides she doesn't want what her mother wants for her, and Gloria doesn't know if she wants it, either.Now the love interests. Let's start with Tobias, the childhood friend. He's got plenty of enjoyable one-liners and pleasant dialogue, should you interact with him. However, I never learn to trust him quite as much as Cinders does in his romance route. He puts his business ethics before Cinders's trust, worrying that she might ruin his reputation as a merchant. This is not a good start to a loving, trusting relationship. He wants to run away with Cinders in order to help her out in the traveler arc, but it would have been nice for his character development if we knew of some reason that he would want to run away from it all, much as Cinders wanted to run away in the Perrault traveler route. Maybe Tobias couldn't stand living in his hometown anymore; maybe he's actually not as honest as he appears, and he has some shady business he's running away from. I think my favorite route for him is Cinders as a noblewoman that marries her, as it seems totally believable that he would lend her a lot of money for social events and later marry her since they're in the same town. I do not like him as a lover to Queen Cinders, but that's because I'm trying to piece how they would stay in contact at court before he becomes a count.Oh, Perrault. So many conflicting feelings. My absolute favorite ending is Perrault as the lover to the Machiavellian Queen Cinders, as it is incredibly believable that she would continue to see him after she becomes queen. He's an interesting character, indecisive on whether he likes killing and duty, but he would be improved by being more human and less tropey. I believe the true happy ending is Cinders adventuring with Perrault, btw ;)And the Prince. So much could have happened! He was a good character with lots of potential! But then he focused on Cinders's looks at the ball... I would've liked to see him spy on her after the ball to determine if she was truly smart, if he was so committed to personality. He just needed more. And he doesn't deserve any ending where he isn't happy. He has to have at least a few flaws!I think the rest of the cast is sufficiently likeable, with the exception of Shady Character. He baffles me. Where'd he come from?And finally, we have.... Cinders!! I love that she's so moldable depending on the player's actions. She can be aggressive and a trail-blazer, or she can be docile and simple. And the text is sufficiently clear that I know the outcome of my actions on Cinders's personality before they're revealed to me. A+.-----End Spoilers----Overall, Story is 7/10, and Characters are 6/10. There's a bit too much going on in plot and not enough going on in character reasoning/development for why they act the way they act.Visuals and SoundThis is where the game shines. The art style is stunning! The characters are all beautiful, and the landscapes are all engrossing. For the average person, there's not much more to ask for. Now, from the perspective of an artist, there is more that could go into the art design. The characters suffer from what I like to call ""Same Face Syndrome"": they all have the same face and differ in how they dress. What if Perrault had a hooked nose? Or Sophie's lips were super thin and had no cupid's bow? This isn't a huge deal, but it is something that I would like to see addressed in future releases. And for a bonus: Tobias's left hand looks super weird. The soundtrack is really fun and fitting, but there could be more sound effects to provide immersion.Overall, Visuals are 8.5/10 and Sound is 7/10.EnjoymentDespite its flaws, it's still a very enjoyable game and a gem in the visual novel genre. I went and replayed it for all the different endings! I'd give it a total 7/10.			"

												Is the classic Cinderella a victim of her stepmother and step sisters, or is she a victim of her own inability to change her circumstances? Do faries steal people's agency in a literary sense as well as literally? Is the self immutable, or can it change in response to circumstance? If it changes in order to better survive difficult times, is that an improvement, or the shameful death of something precious? Is a democratic government merely an excuse for people to lie to each other all the time? In addition to offering a chance to ponder the above questions, Cinders is a fantastic exploration of both self-empowerment and self-destructive tendencies within the context of a classic fairy tale. It also has some fantastically witty lines and some good meditations on romantic love and its strengths and limitations.  For its message of empowerment, ambtitous themes, and fascinating characters, 10/10, cannot wait to play again.			"

												I bought this game on Humble Bundle since it came with a bunch of visually pleasing looking games. Out of sheer curiosity I tried this one because I loved the artwork and figured I could use a change of pace and just play this Visual Novel on nights I just want to relax. Who would've thought I would enjoy this game so much! Which is strange because it is incredibly repetitive since it is just a story, but I love just unlocking all the endings and seeing all the variations within the game. My sis and I have played this for hours now and we haven't tired of it yet. Incredibly unexpected from a Visual Novel, but definitely a pleasant surprise.  If you're looking for something casual and fun to play as you relax, I definitely recommend this game. My only big issue with this is that the dialogue can feel really preachy and didactic, to the point it gets a little pretentious. Certain characters aren't as fleshed out as others (i.e. The Prince, The Fairy, etc.), and then I feel the dev really pushes you to like and respect certain characters when in reality they're still quite awful no matter what choices you make in the game. But all in all, there are plenty of dialogue gems within this game that out weight the cons, and I've been hooked since day one.			"

												Basic Premise: Shape Cinderella’s character, attitude, and reactions to her upbringing and choose how she escapes. The many character trait and action choices that actually impact the story’s end make this visual novel stand out. I’ve played through it several times and still have not found all the paths.Music: Most visual novels’ and sims’ soundtracks have me hunting for the mute button, but this one is gorgeous.Visuals: Gracjana Zielinska’s art has a detailed, ethereal quality without becoming prissy or cutesy.  It’s beautiful.  I’m so pleased she’s returning for Solstice.Programming: I appreciate the ability to quickly skip through already viewed scenes with one button press.  All visual novels should implement this.Writing: *thunk**thunk* *thunk*  That noise, dear friend, is the characters’ dialog and the insights into their behavior being delivered with all the subtlety of a frying pan to the back of the skull. The reader is never left to infer anything. Cinders’ inner monologue or other characters will spell it out. During the first long conversation between Cinders and Sophia, they tell their back-story and motivations to one another without the reservation and self-protection that the back-story would naturally have bred.  It drove me crazy until I remembered Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov. Yes, the two works don’t seem to have much in common but bear with me. Like Karazmov, Cinders uses characters to represent a consistent type of person rather than how you and I would interact on a day-to-day basis. Once you go with it, they both deliver a good story and observations on human nature.  Boom. A 2012 visual novel saved by Dostoevsky.Writing: The banter between characters usually makes me smirk (Sophia and Gloria should have their own spin-off). The only exception is the romantic dialog. Excuse me for a moment, game, while I fetch some nachos to go with all this cheese. Fortunately, the game has many endings with no romance whatsoever.Writing: The grammar, spelling, and word choice are nearly perfect. Kudos to the editor.Female Characters: The writers clearly spent more of their effort developing the women. Cinders, Carmosa, Gloria, Sophia, and Madame Ghede all have distinct personalities and goals. Sophia’s snark is always welcome: “The only things missing from this picture is holding hands and singing. And dancing. Possibly in circles. In the middle of a flowery meadow. I think I might throw up.” I want an ending in which she and Cinders escape together.Male Characters: The men aren’t bad, but they lack the depth and care the women received. I won’t dwell on them (particularly since the developer has already addressed this), but here’s a brief run-down.  Tobias is a childhood friend who tends to deliver motivation speaker advice with the aforementioned frying pan; I want to like you, Toby, but you have to stop thwacking me over the head.  Perrault is a guard captain caught between duty and ethics; he is my favorite of the three.  Prince Basile is he least developed of the three, though the conversations between him and Perrault are good. He and Cinders discuss Levia Malich’s work in a scene ripped straight from Ever After, but other than that I enjoy their interactions.Bottom Line: I recommend this to anyone (not just women) who wants a strong, competent protagonist and enjoys tinkering to discover different endings. If you happen to have a snarky sense of humor, even better.			"

												The premise follows that Cinders acts as a retelling of the classic Cinderella legend, except that, in an attempt to actively subvert what is known as the ""Disneyfied"" 1950's animated film that can in many ways can be considered nothing more than glitz with a bit of a moral, this game allows not only for very distinct and non-black-and-white player choice options but fleshes out each character in new and unexpected directions.And I *love* it.Gone are the cookie-cutter Step-Mother drones Anastasia and Drizella and enter their respective counterparts Sophia and Gloria, and while Gloria does questionably attempt to enact her mother's will on the other two sisters, Sophia constantly snarks, talks back, and even actively rebels against both Gloria and Lady Carmosa, this game's (not-so) Evil Step Mother. This visual novel is all about giving us reasons to understand why these characters act the way they do, and obviously I don't want to spoil anything, but contrary to the popular notion that the antagonists (or anti-heroes in this story) are in cahoots, *nobody* likes each other. And despite her cruelty, even said step-mother has her issues, where most of her actions are explained, understandable, and sympathetic. (In my playthrough, I never got a good answer for why she treats Cinders like an old rag, though.)Of course, what to do with this information is for you to decide. If you feel like disregarding any understanding of these characters' own personal plights and personally attacking them whenever they get in your way, you are allowed this option. Maybe you want to pick a side in this sisterly conflict and get close to Sophia or Gloria; this is something you may do as well. In fact, participating in the subversion of this fairy tale is entirely up to you. You may wish to ask the fairies for help, marry the prince at the expense of your sisters' and step-mother's chances, and live Happily Ever After The End, assuming you can even reach that point. You can also be like me and revell in the story's subversive qualities, actively trying to understand and unite the sisters against their overbearing mother. It's all up to you, and no matter which path you take, the game's story never ever falters, because it's the story *you* want to make. It helps that the game's writing and story are (mostly) beautiful in each path and never fails to at least be interesting.Also, if you couldn't tell by the video and screenshots, the visuals and audio are top-notch. While the somewhat sparse and somewhat static character models can be a bit stiff in their animations (Cinders herself seems to be placed in a perpetual slouch, which, when you think about it, is kind of the point), the backgrounds are always stunningly gorgeous, with details that come alive despite through their hand-drawn aesthetic. The BGM makes up for its limited selection by being amazingly well-produced, even while synthetic (nobody would have expected a full orchestra from an indie studio anyway). The design here is elegent in its subtlety, with slightly differing text sounds for different characters' speech and dim auras surrounding the current speaker.I only take small issue in some of the design choices. For instance, I wish that the game wouldn't notify me whenever a consequence of a certain past decision is being played out. Every time I make a choice, its resulting difference is noted by a small plant symbol that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. Often these are made up of small speech alterations that have little effect on the main story except for alterations in the character's dispositions and their own personal decisions, and sometimes I couldn't tell how a certain sentence would have differed had I made a different choice, or what choice with which that particular piece of text was even associated. Regardless, I'd much rather the mystery of how my decisions change the story be left to my own intuition.Also on the subject of choices, I wish the game wouldn't limit the ability to rewind through decisions made to see all of their immediate effects, especially if the feature's primary marketability involves important and lasting changes that won't necessarily take affect until much later in the story (and at that point, who wants to rewind that far back?). If the game wants me to shape the story the way I see fit, then there's really no need to limit this feature. I understand that certain decisions are meant to be important, lasting, and heavy, and perhaps a rewind feature would take away from this heaviness (there was a moment late in the game where I was confronted with a decision that would essentially determine the ending I'd get and I had to think very hard about my decision), but there are just as many conversational choices that have exactly the opposite effect of their perceived intention. I found myself in a conversation with Gloria on Day 4 during which I said some things I wish I hadn't, and, given the option to take them back, I probably would have. Perhaps this is meant to reflect the weight of real-life decision-making, but this game isn't about that. It's about player choice, and if I'm given a choice that, when chosen, results in the opposite of its intended effect (e.g. Cinders says something rude and condescending when I meant the comment to be compassionate and understanding), then I'd like the option to take it back.Finally, and least importantly, some of the writing in the game is a bit off. Cinders often goes about psychoanalyzing literally everybody she meets, and while this isn't chiefly wrong, since it supports the game's concept of fairy-tale subversion by revealing very real character traits in the people she encounters, it is a bit heavy-handed and perhaps a bit too obvious. Sometimes I wish I could figure these things out for myself without necessarily having Cinders tell me (and the character) directly, and there are other ways for Cinders to handle the conversations and actions she engages. There are a couple of blatant (but necessary) exposition dumps, but this isn't too horrible. There is also some questionable grammar, like the use of -t instead of -ed (e.g. ""spoilt"" instead of ""spoiled"") but this may be era-specific, or the use of a ""than"" in place of a ""then"" or a ""where"" in place of a ""were.""These are minor complaints compared to the quality of the game. If you want to play through it four times to unlock all four endings, it's definitely worth $20. Each playthrough will last you about 5 hours, depending on your reading speed. If you only want to play through it once, it's in the current Humble Bundle (as of writing this), or you can wait for the next big sale.			"

												This game falls under interactive fiction and anyone who is not a fan, or perfers actual gameplay, will not find this paticular game interesting. Now I'll admit that the replayability of this is not so great; it's a bore to play it again. But that's just me and my tastes. I can hardly rewatch a movie because I already know what happens and how it ends.The art style is elegant, beautiful, and all together pleasing and whole. The dialoge is swift in some places, boring and lengthy in others. The beginning is an example of this. Another thing I was a bit iffy about was the limited choices that the game provided. All in all I enjoyed the game the first time, but everything after that was boring as heck - again that's just me - but the characters, endings, art, and story outweighs all those bad things for me.If you're a fan of visual novels, interactive fiction, or something beautiful than please check out this game.

												Just beat this game, and I found the story to be very well-done and robust. The artwork, atmosphere, and music are all great and flow very well with the theme of the game. There isn't much motion, as it is more of an interactive story, but the subtle movements by the background are nice.If you like choose-your-own-adventure style books (I read those Goosebumps ones in my childhood) and reading in general, then you should like playing this game. The choices are very interesting if you can really immerse yourself within the story. The themes centralize around things like freedom/duty/oppression/etc, and I think dystopian-lovers might find some elements here to suit their tastes (although the game does not take place in a dystopia).I got this game in a bundle, and I think the price may be a bit too high (if you don't like reading that much), so maybe wait for it to go on sale if the price is too much for you.

												I bought this game on Humble Bundle since it came with a bunch of visually pleasing looking games. Out of sheer curiosity I tried this one because I loved the artwork and figured I could use a change of pace and just play this Visual Novel on nights I just want to relax. Who would've thought I would enjoy this game so much! Which is strange because it is incredibly repetitive since it is just a story, but I love just unlocking all the endings and seeing all the variations within the game. My sis and I have played this for hours now and we haven't tired of it yet. Incredibly unexpected from a Visual Novel, but definitely a pleasant surprise.  If you're looking for something casual and fun to play as you relax, I definitely recommend this game. My only big issue with this is that the dialogue can feel really preachy and didactic, to the point it gets a little pretentious. Certain characters aren't as fleshed out as others (i.e. The Prince, The Fairy, etc.), and then I feel the dev really pushes you to like and respect certain characters when in reality they're still quite awful no matter what choices you make in the game. But all in all, there are plenty of dialogue gems within this game that out weight the cons, and I've been hooked since day one.			"

												As other reviews have summed it up: Interesting premise, characters, plot and presentiation. Heavy-handed, sometimes preachy dialogue. I found it compelling despite this (admittedly big) flaw, and I think that with that one warning, I can recommend it.			"

												Basic Premise: Shape Cinderella’s character, attitude, and reactions to her upbringing and choose how she escapes. The many character trait and action choices that actually impact the story’s end make this visual novel stand out. I’ve played through it several times and still have not found all the paths.Music: Most visual novels’ and sims’ soundtracks have me hunting for the mute button, but this one is gorgeous.Visuals: Gracjana Zielinska’s art has a detailed, ethereal quality without becoming prissy or cutesy.  It’s beautiful.  I’m so pleased she’s returning for Solstice.Programming: I appreciate the ability to quickly skip through already viewed scenes with one button press.  All visual novels should implement this.Writing: *thunk**thunk* *thunk*  That noise, dear friend, is the characters’ dialog and the insights into their behavior being delivered with all the subtlety of a frying pan to the back of the skull. The reader is never left to infer anything. Cinders’ inner monologue or other characters will spell it out. During the first long conversation between Cinders and Sophia, they tell their back-story and motivations to one another without the reservation and self-protection that the back-story would naturally have bred.  It drove me crazy until I remembered Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov. Yes, the two works don’t seem to have much in common but bear with me. Like Karazmov, Cinders uses characters to represent a consistent type of person rather than how you and I would interact on a day-to-day basis. Once you go with it, they both deliver a good story and observations on human nature.  Boom. A 2012 visual novel saved by Dostoevsky.Writing: The banter between characters usually makes me smirk (Sophia and Gloria should have their own spin-off). The only exception is the romantic dialog. Excuse me for a moment, game, while I fetch some nachos to go with all this cheese. Fortunately, the game has many endings with no romance whatsoever.Writing: The grammar, spelling, and word choice are nearly perfect. Kudos to the editor.Female Characters: The writers clearly spent more of their effort developing the women. Cinders, Carmosa, Gloria, Sophia, and Madame Ghede all have distinct personalities and goals. Sophia’s snark is always welcome: “The only things missing from this picture is holding hands and singing. And dancing. Possibly in circles. In the middle of a flowery meadow. I think I might throw up.” I want an ending in which she and Cinders escape together.Male Characters: The men aren’t bad, but they lack the depth and care the women received. I won’t dwell on them (particularly since the developer has already addressed this), but here’s a brief run-down.  Tobias is a childhood friend who tends to deliver motivation speaker advice with the aforementioned frying pan; I want to like you, Toby, but you have to stop thwacking me over the head.  Perrault is a guard captain caught between duty and ethics; he is my favorite of the three.  Prince Basile is he least developed of the three, though the conversations between him and Perrault are good. He and Cinders discuss Levia Malich’s work in a scene ripped straight from Ever After, but other than that I enjoy their interactions.Bottom Line: I recommend this to anyone (not just women) who wants a strong, competent protagonist and enjoys tinkering to discover different endings. If you happen to have a snarky sense of humor, even better.			"

												The premise follows that Cinders acts as a retelling of the classic Cinderella legend, except that, in an attempt to actively subvert what is known as the ""Disneyfied"" 1950's animated film that can in many ways can be considered nothing more than glitz with a bit of a moral, this game allows not only for very distinct and non-black-and-white player choice options but fleshes out each character in new and unexpected directions.And I *love* it.Gone are the cookie-cutter Step-Mother drones Anastasia and Drizella and enter their respective counterparts Sophia and Gloria, and while Gloria does questionably attempt to enact her mother's will on the other two sisters, Sophia constantly snarks, talks back, and even actively rebels against both Gloria and Lady Carmosa, this game's (not-so) Evil Step Mother. This visual novel is all about giving us reasons to understand why these characters act the way they do, and obviously I don't want to spoil anything, but contrary to the popular notion that the antagonists (or anti-heroes in this story) are in cahoots, *nobody* likes each other. And despite her cruelty, even said step-mother has her issues, where most of her actions are explained, understandable, and sympathetic. (In my playthrough, I never got a good answer for why she treats Cinders like an old rag, though.)Of course, what to do with this information is for you to decide. If you feel like disregarding any understanding of these characters' own personal plights and personally attacking them whenever they get in your way, you are allowed this option. Maybe you want to pick a side in this sisterly conflict and get close to Sophia or Gloria; this is something you may do as well. In fact, participating in the subversion of this fairy tale is entirely up to you. You may wish to ask the fairies for help, marry the prince at the expense of your sisters' and step-mother's chances, and live Happily Ever After The End, assuming you can even reach that point. You can also be like me and revell in the story's subversive qualities, actively trying to understand and unite the sisters against their overbearing mother. It's all up to you, and no matter which path you take, the game's story never ever falters, because it's the story *you* want to make. It helps that the game's writing and story are (mostly) beautiful in each path and never fails to at least be interesting.Also, if you couldn't tell by the video and screenshots, the visuals and audio are top-notch. While the somewhat sparse and somewhat static character models can be a bit stiff in their animations (Cinders herself seems to be placed in a perpetual slouch, which, when you think about it, is kind of the point), the backgrounds are always stunningly gorgeous, with details that come alive despite through their hand-drawn aesthetic. The BGM makes up for its limited selection by being amazingly well-produced, even while synthetic (nobody would have expected a full orchestra from an indie studio anyway). The design here is elegent in its subtlety, with slightly differing text sounds for different characters' speech and dim auras surrounding the current speaker.I only take small issue in some of the design choices. For instance, I wish that the game wouldn't notify me whenever a consequence of a certain past decision is being played out. Every time I make a choice, its resulting difference is noted by a small plant symbol that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. Often these are made up of small speech alterations that have little effect on the main story except for alterations in the character's dispositions and their own personal decisions, and sometimes I couldn't tell how a certain sentence would have differed had I made a different choice, or what choice with which that particular piece of text was even associated. Regardless, I'd much rather the mystery of how my decisions change the story be left to my own intuition.Also on the subject of choices, I wish the game wouldn't limit the ability to rewind through decisions made to see all of their immediate effects, especially if the feature's primary marketability involves important and lasting changes that won't necessarily take affect until much later in the story (and at that point, who wants to rewind that far back?). If the game wants me to shape the story the way I see fit, then there's really no need to limit this feature. I understand that certain decisions are meant to be important, lasting, and heavy, and perhaps a rewind feature would take away from this heaviness (there was a moment late in the game where I was confronted with a decision that would essentially determine the ending I'd get and I had to think very hard about my decision), but there are just as many conversational choices that have exactly the opposite effect of their perceived intention. I found myself in a conversation with Gloria on Day 4 during which I said some things I wish I hadn't, and, given the option to take them back, I probably would have. Perhaps this is meant to reflect the weight of real-life decision-making, but this game isn't about that. It's about player choice, and if I'm given a choice that, when chosen, results in the opposite of its intended effect (e.g. Cinders says something rude and condescending when I meant the comment to be compassionate and understanding), then I'd like the option to take it back.Finally, and least importantly, some of the writing in the game is a bit off. Cinders often goes about psychoanalyzing literally everybody she meets, and while this isn't chiefly wrong, since it supports the game's concept of fairy-tale subversion by revealing very real character traits in the people she encounters, it is a bit heavy-handed and perhaps a bit too obvious. Sometimes I wish I could figure these things out for myself without necessarily having Cinders tell me (and the character) directly, and there are other ways for Cinders to handle the conversations and actions she engages. There are a couple of blatant (but necessary) exposition dumps, but this isn't too horrible. There is also some questionable grammar, like the use of -t instead of -ed (e.g. ""spoilt"" instead of ""spoiled"") but this may be era-specific, or the use of a ""than"" in place of a ""then"" or a ""where"" in place of a ""were.""These are minor complaints compared to the quality of the game. If you want to play through it four times to unlock all four endings, it's definitely worth $20. Each playthrough will last you about 5 hours, depending on your reading speed. If you only want to play through it once, it's in the current Humble Bundle (as of writing this), or you can wait for the next big sale.			"

												A visual novel based on the story Cinderella. This game really presents itself well; it's probably the most polished visual novel I've played, with the only real issue being a typo I found. Simple things like the effect of text appearing on the screen look really great.The art style is colorful, beautiful, and detailed. There's some animation effects on the backgrounds which adds a lot more to the feel of the game than you'd expect. Just small things like water of a lake shimmering, fire moving, sunrays, and things like that. The only character animations are really facial expressions, and sometimes they'll shift poses, but that's more of a rare thing... though the characters will change outfits or poses for different scenes.The music is really well done and there's a good variety here, but nothing I really focused on much.There are 4 endings, but multiple variations of those endings based on how you treated certain characters and things like that. So there's some replayability here, but the story still plays out mostly the same, with just some extra scenes and dialogue peppered in based on some choices you make. A lot of times I felt like the banter back and forth may not add a whole lot to the story, and doesn't create that much extra character depth... ultimately leading to longish periods of time between choice branches. This could also limit replayability, but there is a button to fast-forward through the dialogue that will still pause when there's a choice to be made, or when you reach a new scene you haven't seen before. A really awesome feature. Even though you can skip through quickly using this method, it still takes a LONG time to fast-forward through everything. The story is kind of that long... I think when I started a new story to get a different ending, it still took me an hour to play through even though I fast-forwarded through the majority of the story.The choices in this game can affect a lot, I think. Even though the majority of scenes STILL happen no matter what, the differences in the story with how the characters treat you (and even how your character treats them) provides a more personal feel... rather than picking options that feel out-of-place of your character, your character changes with your options. It's pretty nice in this way.Another really awesome detail this game provides is when you unlock achievements (which relate to the story and in-game decisions.) With each one you unlock, a change happens to the main menu screen... most of the time an item gets added to the scene. It's really a nice detail and just goes to show how much attention was put into this game. There's also a ""reward"" menu where you can see all the unique things you've unlocked, which is nice.Overall, the game is plenty long... I think my first play-through took around 3 hours... which is fairly typical. The long-windedness of some of the dialogue is the only thing that started to fatigue me. There are a lot of choices to be made to keep the interaction up and keep you engaged... the pacing is pretty good overall. When I first started playing the story seemed to throw in your face the fact that the story is Cinderella, which I found a bit annoying and obnoxious, but after that was over with I really enjoyed it. It's Cinderella, so don't expect anything crazy with the main story... you're able to personalize it a bit with your own choices, but all the major plot-points are always hit.I'm definitely keeping an eye out on what this developer puts out next. I hope it's a new, unique story with the same love and care put into it that this game had.			"

												I can say this game was a  treat to play. It takes the story of Cinderella and puts more control for Cinderella's character (in this case Cinders) to make her own way. It even allows a bad ending if you play extremely Genre blind. It is a visual novel and reads like some classic literature where there are long dialogues that are more banter than plot advancement, which may not appeal to some.That said, the art and music is positively beautiful and it does a good job of making characters attractive without overly sexifying them. Though I do wish that Cinders would ♥♥♥♥ing stand up straight. Which does not really matter except for certain late game events where her posture hurts the effect she's supposed to have. It does suit the early parts of the story and is positively nitpicking on my part.There is some discussion on whether the game really promotes independence, as a lot of the independence options are tracked as evil or morally questionable. This is a legit complaint, but I question if it's to fit the time period rather than our own sense of values.Anywho, good game.			"

												Moderately interesting - certainly more so than the original fairy tale. However, the tone is quite preachy, as others have noted. It's more of a digital novel than a game - all you every do is click through a lot of dialog and character's thoughts, while occasionaly making choices as to the next step to be taken. There are a huge number of possible variants to the story, depending on what choices you make through the story.  I played through once, and have not yet decided whether it's worth the effort to do it again for the sake of finding other story variations. I would recommend it at $5, but not the $10 that I paid.

												I had a lot of fun with this visual novel. I've only played it through one time, so obviously I've only gotten one of the possible endings so far, but I had so much fun playing it. I ended up playing it through in two days. The artwork is beautiful (SO BEAUTIFUL!!) and it really is a pleasure to play. I probably could have stopped to stare at each scene for a long time - if I hadn't been making an LP of my play through I may have done just that (that would have been weird even for me!) - because it's just that pretty. I really wish I'd picked this up sooner, but then I probably would have gone a little bonkers waiting for another game from this developer (I'll go nutty after I finish Solstice and have to wait years for another VN from these guys instead I guess. HA! ;) )			"

												This is my FAVORITE STEAM GAME EVER!!! The choices are meaningful, it explores the complexity of family abuse, child raising, sibling rivalry, classism, reputation... it's the most REAL exploration of a ""fairy tale"" I've ever seen! And there aren't any excuses thrown around to justify having only-white characters- there's actually people of color (well, Madame Ghede, who is amazing) and every. single. character. is made real and given life. After a few play-throughs you really get a feel for WHO Cinders is, who her sisters and stepmother are, even who her dead mother and dead father were, PLUS all the romance options, AND the prince, and even side characters who are just townspeople! I would scream with joy if this company/group made an entire serious of games just like Cinders, but exploring the other fairy tales... Snow White, Rapunzel, the Snow Queen by HCA, AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. Then they could start bundling them and selling them as packs. Just a suggestion... or more of a heartfelt wish.Normally $20 is too much to pay for a game, but I ASSURE YOU that this game is WORTH IT!!! I played it for hours and hours and hours and I still never got every single ending! And the game is NOT just a dating sim- who you make Cinders, her values, her beliefs, her choices- these all have long term implications for the nation, the ruling family, HER family, and her life. But the dating is pretty fun, I gotta say!			"

												I came away from this game irritated and insulted. It's preachy, pretentious, and worst of all, it's bad at it. The art is gorgeous, and the level of polish makes this game a pleasure to look at, but the writing is absolutely awful:Every character speaks with the same tone, style and vocabularly--a flat, boring style that is NOT fun to read. What's worse, though, is that the majority of the characters spend the entire game spewing faux-philosophical thoughts, narrating their own motivations and introspection, and reminding each other that everyone should have compassion because everyone else has problems too. What's worse than that, though, is that the writer treats the player like an idiot, and spells out everything--and I do mean everything--over and over again. There were at least 10 different times that the game reminded me that the stepmother has had it rough and deserves a little credit. There is not a single thing that the game lets you figure out for yourself, or at the very least, muse over for a bit before the game reveals it to you. The game actually starts by telling you that the stepmother and stepsisters aren't all that bad and that you need to have compassion for them--something that the player should have been able to figure out for him- or her-self.As a huge fan of visual novels, I bought this game with the intention of playing it through multiple times to explore all the possible endings--but after suffering through it once, I'm never going to touch it again. Don't waste your money.			"

												Having never been a fan of visual novel type games, I took a chance on Cinders because of the ""choices matter"" aspect. Having now finished my first play through, I can heartily recommend this game for purchase. The artwork, the writing, the making of choices all add up to a fun game that can be replayed multiple times to find all the different endings. Having met a less than rosy fate in my first play though, I must play again as it obviously was not the fault of my stellar choices...or was it? Nah, not my fault.			"

The story is based off the fable of Cindarella, however the characters and the way you navigate the world help to make the experience different. The game is well written and balances humour with drama. Each character has their own distinct personality, which you can sometimes change based on your choices.

												Now this is the kind of visual novels I love! You get to choose your own personality and make your own choices as you play the game and the characters adjust their attitudes towards you based on your previous choices. It's a very mature and complex version of the Cinderella story. The writer turned the ugly stepsisters and evil stepmother into surprisingly realistic characters. They all have reasons for being the way they are and actually some fairly decent redeeming qualities. You don't end up hating them by the end. The game leaves you really feeling for them and trying to understand what they're going through. My only regret is that the game was not longer and that there aren't more games like this out there. This is the perfect example of my favorite type of games. It has epic artwork and music; good, quality characters and is just wonderful in every aspect. If you like visual novels then I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												Now, this is a fantastic game. What really stood out for me was the stunning art. The visuals are very well-done and they really help set the tone for Cinders. The characters felt alive; they're not shallow like the ones in the fairy tale. A lot of thought had definitely been put into the dialogues as they're engaging and witty at times. They really speak to the characters. The storyline follows the generic one of the Cinderella, with many interesting variations thrown in to make Cinders stand on its own and speak to the players.There are four endings to the game, with some variations which are shaped by your decisions. In theory, Cinders has very high replayability due to the sheer number of choices and branches that it has. However, I lost interest before discovering all the ending variations. For one, I found the variations to be minor. Two, it was tedious to have to go through the same events and dialogues over and over again, even in fast-forward. After a certain point, it was just not worth the effort to go through the motions to see how else the conclusions could vary, especially since I was quite satisfied with the ones I did get already. I think a contributing factor to my eventual lost of interest is that I feel the choices I made reflected my values and overall outlook. You could find that some decisions really speak to you and there's just no desire to choose the alternatives; it's likely that you'll like the first ending you got the most. And that's the case for me.			"

												Cinders is a choose-your-own-adventure style ""game"" (an interactive novel) based on the story of Cinderella.  It is fairly well written and manages to take the classic characters and make them seem like actual people with depth and complexity.  The protagonist Cinders is not simply a victim for the reader to root for as the story lifts her out of her misery to make her live happily ever after and the ""evil stepmother"" is pitiable and puts up a good argument for her actions as is the case with the stepsisters.  I've only gone through one variation of the story but there seems to be about 16 endings.  I really enjoyed it for the interesting choices and how the characters' motivations clashed without devolving into a struggle of good vs. evil.			"

Sometimes the dialogue is stilted where it shouldn't be, but for the most part it's funny and full of character. And as a bonus, your choices feel like they really matter, with visual feedback when you change the story in some way. Highly recommended for fans of story-driven games (though this is interactive fiction more than anything) and visual novels.			"

												Played it more than I should have, tried out different outcomes and was more than pleased.A really decent example of non-linear storytelling. While the barbie-like aesthetics do take some getting used to and are unnerving at first, the music does add a great deal to the whole fairy-tale atmosphere and the characters do the make the experience a compelling one.

												An enjoyable take on the Cinderella tale, with sufficient twists and tweaks to continue making everything interesting. The plots' decent enough, the characters are relateable, and the artwork is simply gorgeous. All in all, quite enjoyable.			"

												This is a beautiful visual novel. The backgrounds and art are stunning. Also enjoyed the twists on the traditional Cinderella story. If you are not into this type of game, you will probably not enjoy it, as it is not a typical ""game"" and could be a boring experience for some people. But if you enjoy visual novels, then give it a try! The dialogue is mostly entertaining, although I found a few parts too preachy or otherwise a little cheesy. Plenty of endings so definitely re-playable. May not be worth the full price considering it is still a pretty short game, so I'd suggest getting it on sale like I did. Also, the skip option was a nice option for dialogue that you don't want to read through all over again (especially if you're shooting for extra endings/achievements).			"

												I bought this game after watching a few YouTubers play it, which might affect my view on its replayability. While it can be replayed numerous times, some of the choices felt like they gave the same effect. Of course, this is to be expected sometimes with this genre of game. I really enjoy ""choose your own story"" games, so I did like this. Cinders is beautifully illustrated, it has a fascinating story, and some cool achievements. I think I have played it through completely around eight times total, and everytime I did enjoy it. However, I am glad you have the ability to skip chunks of text, as a lot of them end up being the same.			"

												A more cynical and real-world approach to the fairytale. Entertaining as a visual novel with some choice elements, if that's your poison. Some of the dialogue is a mixture between colloquial and old-world language, which was humorous to say the least. Skip option for scenes you are replaying was definitely well utilized when picking up all the achievements. Safe to say there are a good lot of endings to choose from.Worth picking up if you're into this kind of thing.			"

												Game: CindersStyle: Visual NovelLength: 4 hours for 2 play throughsOverall impression: Meh.*** Spoiler Free Review ***Cinders is a visual novel which means plenty of reading.  There is no voice acting so if that isn't your thing you should pass.  As the game's title suggests this is a different take on the classic fairy tale Cinderella with several differnt ways to end the story.  The biggest question in this style of game is usually ""How much does my decisions throughout the game change the story?""  the answer to this question is the usual amount.  The decisions you make for the vast majority of the game seems to replace one piece of interchangable diologue with another.  It seems that if Cinders acts in a largely uncarictaristic manner the supporting will seem to forget previous conversations and act accordingly which kind of killed the mood for me.  Ultimately only a few decisions actually change the ending but an unexpected surprise is that the decisions you make add some nice flavor to the endings which is a really nice touch.  Often times in Cinders characters make social commentary this may rub some people the wrong way considering the political nature of video games at the moment, so, be prepared for that. Astetics and music: The game is illustrated by Gracjana Zielinska and the influence is there in spades and this gives the game an amazing look.  The music is nice and enjoyable but knows its place in a background role so if you are a slower reader the music doesn't get annoying which I think is important for this style of game. Is it worth the money?  The game is currently $19.99 on steam although it was recently a part of the humble eye candy bundle.  I can't reccomend this title at the current price tag.  If the games goes on sale for under $5 or if the bundle returns it will be well worth a play through.			"

												Cinders is seriously one of the best visual novels you will ever play. I got sucked into this game and I've absolutely loved it. I have some critical feedback for it, but that by no means negates the magificance of this interactive story.Pros+ The writing is definitely the best I've ever encountered in a Steam visual novel. If you're a story-motivated gamer who appreciates a solid piece of high-quality writing, this game will be a breath of fresh air. + Characterization goes above and beyond. No longer do you see the flat, 2-dimensional characters you've come to know from Disney's Cinderella. All the characters, even the ""bad"" ones, are more than what meets the eye. You also have a hand in tailoring Cinders's personality to your liking, which is fun. Cinders can be passive, manipulative, friendly, sensual, rebellious, responsible, romantic, family-oriented, or murderous... whatever floats your boat.+ The story gives you a feeling of control, which is imperative for me to enjoy VNs. Your choices *do* make a big difference, even if it seems like they're not really doing anything at first. The choices the story presents you with open up different paths and will give you different endings. Some choices create vastly different outcomes, others give more subtle changes.+ The artwork is stunning. Not only is it a unique style, but everything from the backgrounds to the characters looks polished and detailed. + The characters are animated beautifully. Their expressions change, their postures change, and even their eyes move! I thought this was a nice touch.+ The soundtrack creates the perfect ambiance and it is simply exquisite to listen to.Cons- It's not that long (I think my first playthrough was maybe 5 hours? but I read fast), especially when you do replays to get achievements and epilogues. A lot of time is spent skipping over scenes during replays because, depending on your choices, it's possible that only a few lines of text will change.- All relationship stats and personality stats are hidden, so you don't see how your stats are changing when you make choices. This makes it harder to see if you're on track with what you're wanting to do.- I wish there were more routes that could further deviate from the traditional Cinderella tale. For example, I wish there were options to not go to the ball, to choose no ""fairy godmother"" to help you, to gang up with your step-sisters to overtake Carmosa, to romance some other unexpected people (the Shady Character maybe? hahaha) or... the possibilities are endless! Basically, even though this game is already amazing, it could have been even cooler if there were some other creative pathways you could take.Overall, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. It's earned a special place in my heart. Though I can definitely find areas for improvement, this game is too much a great experience to pass up.			"

												Cinders is definitely a departure from what you normally find on Steam. A stunning and interesting adaptation of Cinderella, Cinders is a visual novel and Choose Your Own Adventure story that captures, in a grown-up way, the spirit you had and the magic you felt reading as a child. The only two things creating this world are artwork and music, as the dialogue – the heart of the game – is all text. Surprisingly, I did not come across many grammatical errors, and being the English major I am, I was certainly looking. Editors have done quite the job. The storytelling was thoughtful and well-crafted; the writing was intelligent and contained more adult humour than I expected. In the short period of time it took to get through the first playthrough (roughly five hours), the writing delved into the pasts of a few characters and built them up to be more than just one-dimensional. Though most of the art is static, the odd flicker of the fireplace, shimmer of water or subtle eye and lip movements somehow bring it entirely to life. Though more colourful and detailed, the artwork does remind me of that which you would find in old hardcover fairytale books. The ambient music is absolutely beautiful and changes with each scene, though because it was the only auditory element it did have me longing for even more variety at times (as the songs are repeated); I wish the soundtrack contained even more. Though based on a traditional story with a subdued and passive female protagonist, this modern adaptation takes some unexpected and satisfying departures and shines more light on the complex relationships between the characters and Cinders’ struggle for independence and thirst for freedom. There is a focus on family and the conflicts between taking care of others and taking care of oneself. The heart of the story is finding one’s own path in life and understanding that each choice you make has a consequence, either immediately or in the future, for both yourself and those around you. In this way, the replay value of this game is pretty spectacular: it has four possible endings. And in all honesty, I think I am actually going to play through to see all of them.If you enjoy reading and visual novels, Cinders is absolutely with a playthrough (or four!).			"

												Cinders starts off as an interactive version of Cinderella , but quickly gains a large amount of depth. The multituide of different choices and how many different results branch off the beginning are astounding. The art style is lovely and the narrative progresses in an intriguing way. The different characters are each interesting in their own right, and watching the way that they develop and help or hinder you throughout the story is fascinating. For some people this sort of game (text-based adventure) could be a little too slow and possibly boring, but this is a prime example of a good T-B-A. It's not overly long (2.5 hours per playthrough depending on your speed and choices), and gives you hints as to how diverse the story could be on multiple playthroughs. This diversity of narrative is suggested through a collection of trophies that correlate to particular plot points that you unlock through role-playing in different ways. I've played through the game twice and have still only unlocked 3 of the 8 possible tropies, and definitely plan on playing through this game a few more times.4/5 - Would thoroughly recommend to any fans of this genre of game, but also to anyone contemplating trying it.

I love how you can shape Cinders' character through some small actions and the story is a brilliant, mature take on Cinderella. I found it really interesting to see the different characters and hints of their backstory, giving the impression that you don't know whats going on and why they act in a certain way - the characters felt very realistic. I really like the reward system and how it displays it; it was a small touch but I loved it! On the rewards page it also shows you different paths and how much you have completed of each which really makes me want to play this game until I unlock every option it has. So far I have played through the story twice and noticed a few subtle changes in dialogue that made it feel like I was making a new character both times.			"

												Cinders takes a classic fairytale and returns it with a much darker, more entertaining twist. You /could/ be sweet and marry the prince, or your choices could take you down an entirely different path. The endings all have variables, so who helps you get to the ball, who you decide to pursue as a love interest, or various other factors on Cinders all affect the ending you see. As a personal note one think I love about the game is that the romance isn't necessarily the focus. Instead the focus is how Cinders decides to take control of her life and change it. You could do that via romance, or you could do something else.None of the characters are just stock characters. They're all developed and have real personalities and reasons for acting the way they do. Even Cinders has a base personality that you affect and develop through your choices, but she never feels like a blank slate. If ever there was a visual novel where the choices matter, it's this one, a fitting trait given the focus of the game.Other factors about the game feel obvious. The art's gorgeous, even more so than the screenshots suggest. There are subtle movements in the background to enjoy that give Cinders that magical feel fairytales ought to have. Cinders is well written and well developed. Any fan of visual novels should pick this one up, and if you're interested in the genre this is definitely the game to start with.			"

												I played at this game really fast.The artwork is beautiful, the settings have a magic atmosphere. The plot deviates from the classic fable, thank to psychological traits, also. When you're playing, if you have a lot of immagination, you can feel relaxed. The soundtrack helps this magic atmosphere to make you feel good.Lastly, the main characters are well planned and, during the game, they don't lose their original attitude.			"

												This is a brilliant game. Cinders is so different from the typical fairytale, she talks back and is not afraid of telling it like it is. The art work is fantastic and the graphics from the sunlight coming through the window to the dust mites dancing amongst it are very detailed. The characters are really interesting and I loved how you get to sympathise slightly with the step sisters which you would never think of doing! Loved this game so much, thank you!			"

												I picked up this game after never having had much of an interest in interactive novels, and can say that this game is very easy to pick up for those new to the genre. Having not played or researched many games of the genre, I can't really comment on how innovative this is within the context of its genre. I was thinking of postponing a review of Cinders until after I had played more of the genre, but I doubt I will do this in the near future. So here is a review, to be returned to if I do ever have something to add.A pretty great interactive take on a classic tale, the large amount of well thought-out endings based on choices made through the game lend well to the feeling of coming of age of the heroine, Cinders. It is also a refreshing take to give Cinderella more agency and control over her life, though she as a character may not realise how much influence she has. The endings closest to the original fairytale really felt well-earned as you really felt like you had to push Cinders to making responsible decisions despite the temptation to let Cinders be snarky and dwell on revenge.All-in-all the decisions felt quite organic in how they impacted the story despite the fixed events throughout the story and the number of game-influencing variables which is remarkable in any game. I thoroughly enjoyed replaying to find all the endings and the variants therein, and the eight save slots, fast-forward function and the flower indicator for branching story moments were a great help in this. It would have been nice to have an even faster way of scrolling or even skipping to the next decision, but what was there worked well.The music was great and perfectly suited to the mood of the game, and so were the beautiful painted-looking environments.  The touch of movement and change in lighting was also well done, present but subtle. The character design is very solidly well done, such that the few trappings of anime and manga in the style are not off-putting even to those who they do not appeal to.It is great to see this smart and well-made interactive retelling of Cinderella come to Steam where sales will hopefully help it reach a much greater audience.

												This is a beautiful visual novel. The backgrounds and art are stunning. Also enjoyed the twists on the traditional Cinderella story. If you are not into this type of game, you will probably not enjoy it, as it is not a typical ""game"" and could be a boring experience for some people. But if you enjoy visual novels, then give it a try! The dialogue is mostly entertaining, although I found a few parts too preachy or otherwise a little cheesy. Plenty of endings so definitely re-playable. May not be worth the full price considering it is still a pretty short game, so I'd suggest getting it on sale like I did. Also, the skip option was a nice option for dialogue that you don't want to read through all over again (especially if you're shooting for extra endings/achievements).			"

												I walked away disappointed by this game, which I had high expectations for. Cinders has the basics of a good game - beautiful artwork, interesting chracter design, and a multitude of different game paths. The writing is where this game/visual novel fails. All characters ""sound"" the same in their thoughts and speech. Details about the characters are repeated over and over in the dialogue instead of developing the characters over time. This made the characters very flat and lacking necessary dimension. The same points kept being repeated over and over: even horrible people deserve respect and second chances, we never really understand a person's stance because people are so terribly complex, father and fairies blah blah, the witch is hated by the townspeople, and so on.

												I've been wanting to try this game for a while but found the price tag a bit too steep to risk it. Bought it on sale for $6 and thought it was worth it. Pros: Graphics are lovely. A few hours of game play.Interesting take on the cinderella story. Ctrl key can skip some sections you've already played through. Cons: Some of the dialogue and story pacing is a bit slow and awkward or stiff. (Some sections are very good though!)Some romance options seemed a bit rushed through or sudden.Although the sparkly text roll out is cute, sometimes it gets a bit slow and I wished the text would roll out faster. (Hitting enter didn't always work). Lots of repeated dialogue and some pretty serious railroading happening though much of the book which limits replay value. So if you can get it on sale and like visual novels I'd say get it and give it a try.  "

												+Lots of choices+Well-written dialogue+Beautiful artwork-Controls seem a little off-Girly theme might not appeal to allOverall score: 8/10To begin, let me start off by saying that Cinderella is my least favorite fairy tale princess. Why? Because Cinderella cries and her Fairy Godmother magically fixes everything for her. Seriously? A crybaby princess? I think I’d prefer narcoleptic Sleeping Beauty over that.Thankfully, Cinders is not that story.Instead, Cinders is a game where you need to decipher the motivations and secrets of the people around you. You want a Fairy Godmother? Of course you can have one! You just have to work for it. You have to use logic to figure out what the best choices are, and, unlike some other VNs, the choices you have to make actually do make sense when you think about it. There are also many choices to make (I counted 47 on my first playthrough), so the game has plenty of re-playability if you want to get every ending. In addition, I found the artwork to be beautiful (or at least charming) and the dialogue was very believable (and funny at times).The two critiques I have of this game were easily overlooked by me, but I figured they were worth mentioning. First, the buttons are a little off. Intuitively, you would think that you would hover over the words for each button in order to make your choice. However, you actually have to be about half a centimeter above the buttons in order to click things. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it’s slightly annoying. Second, you’re playing as Cinders. Therefore, the game has an obviously girly theme. Even as a girl, I always thought that fairy tale princesses were too girly, and I never cared for them that much. I can imagine that, as a guy, this game might be a bit much. However, I would like to say that you can definitely still enjoy Cinders if you’re a masculine guy, as long as you’re an avid fan of VNs. If you think it’s still too girly, wait until Moa Cube releases Solstice.Overall, Cinders is a very good VN and if you’re fan of the genre, you should definitely give this one a go.			"

												Cinders is my favorite gateway visual novel. A.) It’s a familiar story and has fairly simple mechanics. B.) It’s not anime/Japanese flavoured, so it isn’t plagued with some of the *ahem* odder tropes that can be off-putting to people who aren’t already familiar with that media. Those alone are enough for me to recommend it to most people, but the art, writing, presentation, and replayability all elevate the game from good to great in my eyes. The only real flaw I think is the small number of save slots, which makes for a bit more work if you’re going for all the ending variants.			"

												Cinders is an amazing reinterpretation of the Cinderella's Tale in the form of a Visual Novel, where we don't necessarily have a naive protagonist and no one is entirely good or entirely evil. As in life, this game grants us many more options than the ones who will led us to the childish ""happy ever after ending"", after all. The writing is as great as it's unique artwork. All the characters are well-developed and all small choices are significant and influence the plot. Should Cinders really just marry the prince, loving him or not? Marry the prince but, screw him, let's rule alone? Maybe she should kill her stepmother and take hold of her estate instead? Run away and start a new life elsewhere? You decide!A must play game for everyone who likes Visual Novels.			"

												A very well written take on the classic Cinderella tale. Part of what made the game for me was how three dimensional the characters are. In the original tale the step mother and sisters were such evil caricatures that they are as realistic as any pantomime villian (i.e not at all). In Cinders, while still mostly despicable, they are fleshed out and given realistic motivations for their actions and that helps the whole tale resonate much more. There are quite a few paths through based on what descisions you make during conversations so there is some replay value, though you will have to sit through quite a bit of the same text and dialogue if you wish to see them all, as often the variations aren't major until the end. All in all a fantastic visual novel with a story that will continually surprise you with the turns it takes while at the same time making you laugh with its witty dialogue and gentle pokes at traditional fairy tales.Pros:Excellent writingFull of twists and surprisesWell realized charactersAwesome soundtrackMultiple endingsCons:Getting all the endings can be a bit of a chore			"

												This game is incredible. If you love twisted fairy tales and the ability to manipulate the story, then you'll have a ton of fun with it. The story is such a good twist on the original and you have so many opportunities to change the outcome. I still haven't been able to figure out how to achieve all the endings, although if you play enough of it you'll see easily how the decisions diverge. I wish there were a complete walkthrough for each of the endings, but unfortunately I haven't found one yet. Before I bought the game I had no idea just how many endings there were; there are four main ways to end the story, but each one of those endings has four or five different endings as well. It's incredible how easy it is to get sucked into the game. And, fortunately, if you've encountered a line of conversation before, the game will let you skip all the dialogue until you hit something new. I love the art style and although there isn't any voice acting involved, the music is soothing (and can be turned off if you're not into it). The game developers have done a great job with the characters as well. Cinders herself can be incredibly devious or a pushover, depending on how you play her.

												Cinders is a story that takes start on a classic fairytale, but quickly becomes something much more mature, realistic and interesting. It's a story about women, their choices, motives and personalities and how all this lead to very different lives and consequences. But more than that, it's a story about Cinders - smart, brave, kind and ambitious girl, who doesn't want to sit and wait for her happiness and prince who saves her, but rather takes her fate into her own hands. The game is really replaying and roleplaying - all your choices have their consequences that may not appear now, but take place later, when you almost forgot about them, so chose wisely. You have many possibilities to turn story in your favor, every ending has many variants and sometimes its change the tone of an ending completely. Your Cinders can be kind and modest, wise and bold, egoistic and rude - all this changes the story that you'll see. I really recomend you to try and play, especially if you fan of visual novels or choices and consequences games. Cinders really worth a shot. And it has marvellous strong female characters, something that we don't see often, sadly.			"

												Keeping in mind what this game is, it's beautiful, intriguing and keeps you wondering what would happen if you chose any other path, which is what games like this are supposed to do as that keeps you playing them.Now, if you like freedom of movement, freedom of character development or freedom of customizing your experience, I can't recommend that you would enjoy this game. Cinders, for all the beauty and wonder of her world, is very firmly set in it. Despite getting to know all these little things about the world around Cinders, at her core she stays the same person, which is a little difficult to believe considering how drasticly each of her paths can change. Not only is Cinders fairly grounded in her ways, but also everyone around her. Not to spoil anything, but none of your decisions are going to make anything truly amazing or drastic happen. You will simply be able to examine this story from all possible angles and, as was common with oral-passed stories in the past, determine which moral or characteristic is more prominant in the success or failure of the story.It's fun if you like that sort of thing.

It's an overall fun, mature (but *no nudity!*)  twist on the Cinderella story. The characters have great depth (depending on how you play the game), and there's several differnet paths and combinations you can take that maximize the playthrough value. One aspect that might be frustrating is that the game does not make obvious what the different personality choices are coded as. For example, is the choice you picked ""good,"" ""bad,"" or ""naive?"" The lack of labelling makes the game a bit more challenging to get all the endings. If you are looking for a quick playthrough for 100% completion, you may have to go online if you don't want to do it through trial and error.Overall amazing game with great relationships, story, and visuals. Highly recommended for those who like VNs or those who are looking to get into the VNs.			"

												A short game, roughly 2 hours the first playthrough, Any new ones after that will have ~5-10 minutes of unique content as you try out different paths. There are a lot of endings yet it doesn't feel rewarding striving for them since they are only a few lines of text, often just ~3 rows different between endings.The first playthrough is fun and makes you consider what the best answers would be since they are set against each other. The second time through all that tension is gone since you now have a set goal and know roughly what each options does.			"

												A beautiful branching visual novel that suffers from spotty writing. Cinders is a fairly short but mostly entertaining affair if you go through it once, but the number of paths is commendable and the outcomes can vary quite a lot. The writing does come off as a bit amateurish, and I found myself shouting ""NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT!"" to myself on occasion. That said, I would recommend this at around $5 or so.			"

												I absolutely love reading, so for me, this made the game all the more interesting. While the story of Cinderella has never been one of my favorite fairy-tales, this isn't the typical Cinderella story. While there are elements of Cinderella, I believe they took her story and twisted it to be what it should REALLY be like. My boyfriend bought me this game as a Christmas present, but I've honestly played it more than some of the other games in my list. The replayability is phenomenal, although you'll eventually get tired of answering the same questions over and over. There are several different endings, and I mean SEVERAL. I've gotten all of the achievements and even went back over and over to try and get the different endings. If you don't make a strategy to follow the line of questioning to lead you to a certain ending, you may not get it..so try, try again! AND SPAM THE CTRL BUTTON IF YOU RE-PLAY. It gets tedious reading the same stuff over and over. But the story is absolutely stunning!Replayability - 10/10Achievements (Some are tough to get if you don't strategize..fair warning) - 10/10Story - 10/10Price - Try to get it when it's on sale. I love the game, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $14 + that they're asking for. No offense to the company. Determination to get EVERY ending and EVERY possibility - PRICELESS <3 "

												Cinders, a twist on the classic Cinderella fairy tale, is all about its characters. It has all the elements of Cinderella: A ball, a prince you can pursue, evil stepsisters and stepmother, and a fairy godmother. However, Cinders herself is a strong, optimistic, and self-reliant woman capable of taking her future into her own hands. Her stepsisters and stepmother are well developed characters that you can get to know and maybe even understand. The fairy godmother isn't perfect and neither is the prince. Add to that the Captain, the town witch, and Cinder's old friend the merchant, and you have a variety of extremely interesting characters with their own stories and complicated relations to you and each other. Throughout the game, your interactions with them and your decisions for Cinders helps her decide which path to freedom to take. Each broad ending has a variety of unique and lovely sub-types.If this hasn't told you this game is worth playing, then add to that the lovely artwork with small background animations and very realistic and expressive character art, the beautiful music, and the tiny fact that the dialogue speed matches the speed of the character speaking. This last fact really helps you mentally hear how people are speaking. Honestly, it's as close as you can get to voice acting without actually having voice acting in it.tl;dr Go play Cinders. It's amazing. 10/10			"

												I just finished this story for the first time. It was beautiful and extremely well written. I enjoyed it immensely and found the story very moving. I was often crying because of its wonderful twists and turns. Already I am wondering how things might be different, what if I romance a character, choose a different goal, or a different method. There are so many obvious ways to change the plot, and yet the beatiful branches that appear suggest that there are many subtle ways to influence it also. I'm a person who will reread a book over and over if I find it good enough. This is no different, I would love to read this again even if it would be exactly the same, knowing that I can make it different each time only heightens my desire to read this again.As you can probably see, I'm reviwing this mostly as a story. This is because that is what it is. I am glad they didn't try to put a thin veneer of game onto this story because I think they focussed on what was important, and that is a part of what makes this so good.			"

												Cinders is a lovely and charming game. I'm a sucker for fairy tale retellings, and this one really does do it for me. The variety of endings you can get based on your choices makes this extremely replayable, and none of the endings or paths are directly linear. Of course this does mean you'll have to revisit a lot of conversations again, but luckily there is a Skip function that will glaze over scenes you've already seen. Needless to say, the art is beautiful. So much love and care went into the details of the environment, as well as making sure the characters properly emote. Writing is pretty good, with my only complaint being that the dialogue for Cinders felt a little out of place from the setting. (Possibly an attempt to be more relatable to the player?) It's a small nitpick in a sea of praise though. I loved this game, and would be all over another fairytale retelling from the developers.			"

												Much like a choose your own adventure book, Cinders makes you want to go back and choose all the possible options once going through the game once. Skeptical of the replay value at first, the way Cinders delves into complex human relationships and decisions that aren't always cut and dry keeps things interesting for multiple play-throughs. The storyline is rich and entertaining, and the artwork is a perfect compliment to the style of the game. A wonderful take on the classic Cinderella tale that takes things on a much deeper level of abstraction. You'll find yourself really struggling with your own morality and logic while trying to navigate this small yet immensely detailed world.			"

												Playing this game reminds me of the interesting module GAT330: Interactive Narrative and Character Creation that I took in USA. Basically this is a story of Cinderella, whereby player take control of the mentioned character and make choices in the thinking and dialouge process whereby it ultimately makes the ending that can be very different from the old school fairy tale. As for the choice I made, I choose to elope with the Prince Charming's Captain Guard instead because after all, I wanted a different twist to the original story and if I am closer to the Captain Guard, why not?Excellent story visual novel telling! I wouldn't mind playing again months later to see how my other choices can adversely affect the outcome of the original story. Excellent artwork with subtle but powerful transition as well. I definately want to create a twist to an original fairy tale/game in the near future as I am quite inspired by the execution of the entire game in terms of the direction that it is going.Highly Recommended to everyone!

												Wonderful game! I have only played it through the once, but I will definitely be playing it more and more so that I can get all the different endings and so on :)To be more formal in the review format, I'd say this game reminds me a lot of Long Live the Queen by Hanako. It is a visual novel, and choice is the most critical thing. I haven't even glossed the surface of what the various choices can lead to, but the game is definitely good at making your choice be valued.The visuals are adorable, if a bit simple. They work well for the story they're trying to tell. The story is based on the Cinderella fairy tale (it took me way too long to make that connection) but it takes that structure and story idea and really makes a fascinating pathway through. I got attached to the characters and their situations in a far more detailed way than I would in a typical story following Cinderella conventions. I believe I got this game on a Humble Bundle deal, however given the depth and whatnot, I'd say it is well worth the price. My first playthrough took me about two and a half hours and I've still got many an ending to unlock and various achievements to get. If you like female protagonists and stories that involve strong female leads you will like this. If you're a fan of the visual novel genre, you will like this. And if you like literary subversion, I'd say you'd like this. Grab it!			"

												If you enjoy a visual novel style game, this modern update on the story of Cinderella will delight and amuse. With a great sense of humor, the writing references numerous fairy tales and pokes fun at their tropes. The eponymous character, Cinders, is interesting, witty, and strong, no matter whether you choose to make her choose a more naive path or one taking a great deal more effort and self reliance. The romance element is nicely worked in such that you can entirely avoid having it be a big part of Cinders' life and future, or you can carry on multiple affairs at once, allowing them to shape that future. Although it was nice to see the ""evil"" stepsisters represented as a bit less two-dimensional, I can't help but feel an opportunity was lost in not giving them more of a role in the story. It would have been great to see endings in which Cinders assists one or both of the sisters in acheiving their goals. On the whole, though, a solid game with some replay value, especially if you save at key turning points in the story so you don't have to go back to the very beginning each time.			"

												A very nice surprise and my favorite from the Humble Eye Candy Bundle, and eye candy it is, with gorgeous artwork, enhanced with animation and visual effects timed with story events. The music is wonderful, with synchronized changes and leitmotif cues.I'm new to visual novels, and the concept and writing drew me in. Choices are presented frequently and sensibly enough, with a flower appearing in the top-right corner to note when your choice impacted your playthrough outcome. The nonlinearity of the choices provides multiple interesting paths to four basic outcomes with multiple permutations based on your relationships with other characters, as well as your protagonist's personality. Subsequent playthroughs are easy, as dialogue can be skipped (super fast-forward), automatically stopping at new dialogue or choices.The writing is generally solid and engaging, with very few spots that are slightly clunky but easily forgivable. Character development is deep for the four women, and amusingly and probably intentionally, the supporting cast of men are somewhat one-dimensional. The concept of a reimagined Cinderella itself is quite fun and more contemporary with an emphasis on female protagonist agency, with some very helpful friends to retain the fanciful nature of the original story.If you're new to visual novels but like things like Joe Dever's Lone Wolf saga, RPGs with deep character development, and Telltale's Walking Dead series, and consider the possibility that games can be art, you would probably enjoy this.

You could get caught up in just looking at the visuals of this game.  Just wow.  Amazing good.  I wanted to screenshot everything, it was just so beautiful to look at. - There are four or five different endings which are pretty interesting and give it a good playback value. - If you take your time, Cinders takes about four or five hours to complete per round.  - Very fitting soundtrack music.  It's nice and relaxing - which says a lot because I normally have to turn down or turn off the music because of getting annoyed.  I didn't have to in this game. - It's a great game to play before bed since it's a visual novel - it's very relaxing and doesn't take a lot of energy to play.  You can just read and make some choices here and there.  - It's very different from ""Disney's Cinderella."" It's a complete retelling of the story, so you won't get bored reading it likely and it's fairly decently written - it's entertaining at least and some fun options by the end and cool characters.  They are not completely one-dimensional.			"

Cinders is so far the best experience of that genre (edit: now ""Eden"" is). The multiple endings aren't as creative is I was hoping for originally, but they were fun all the same. The choices given mid game are actually more interesting then the end much like in Soul Gambler. The story is done very well and the characters are well developed. The only thing I would have wished for was more shocking outcomes... after all with these women I expected to feel the drama at the end more.			"

												By far the most beautiful visual novel I've played.  Worth it for the art alone.  But the rest of the game is also excellent - the story is the right mix of classic and something fresh, the characters have been fleshed out magnificently, and the presentation of the writing is easy to read and feel involved in.

												I really loved Cinders from the very first moment I picket it up. The style is incredibly beautiful and bursts of colours and details. But don't get fooled by a nice dress. This fairy tale has all the depth and psychological weight to complete the Grimm madness of a fairy tale into a believeable family drama.I highly enjoyed every scene and line of dialogue and love the twists and choices the MOA CUBEs come up with. Your favorite fairy tale excellently crafted with your choice of ball room dress. Can't wait to play more from those guys!			"

												Cinders is a visual novel that retells the Cinderella story. The user does get to make choices a long the way and there are a number of endings, but the choices aren't as deep or as often as a choose your own adventure type of story. I've never been  a fan of the original Cinderella story, but I did enjoy this. The writing was very well done and the characters had depth. I'm actually tempted to replay the game and discover some of the other endings.			"

												There are many things to like about this game, and not much to find fault with. There is a lot of text to read, but the pacing is very nice, and is written like an interesting book. The illustration is fantastic; the artist makes stunningly attractive people which make the game very very easy on the eyes. The story is familiar, but has enough of a spin to keep it fresh. There is not action, per se, but there is drama. Enjoyed it, and I intend on re-visiting it so that I can explore some alternate endings. The only complaint I can find with this game at this moment is the price. at a $20 usd price point, it does not present a good value. [ 7 / 10 ]			"

												I have really, really enjoyed Cinders. It feels very real, and I really appreciate the work that has gone into developing the theme of self-determination (or maybe that's just the theme of my first playthrough). I'm amazed that it's supporting my efforts to build relationships with Cinder's sisters and it seems to be ""paying"" off.This is one of the games that really, really hits the spot. It's not ""Gone Home"" yet, but at the same time, I haven't finished it.Must buy, especially during the humble bundle.

It's easy to replay to get the general ending you're after, and I'm not inspired enough to tweak my choices to see if I can get certain things (friendship with one or both sisters, running off with the shopkeeper, that kind of thing). It's very good, though, even if it's not quite great.			"

Small things like an open window swinging in the background, or the characters' eyes moving as they're on screen adds a lovely dynamic to the game. The choices also have substance, changing the story in subtle ways.

												This is a gorgeous, polished, thoughtfully-written visual novel that walks a nice middle ground as far as complexity goes - it's hard to ""break"" the narrative with one's choices (which is a problem a lot of otome games run into), but there are still lots of those choices and you can really see their impact on how the game unfolds and resolves.  The endings are broken down into four main categories, with a lot of room for variation within those categories that makes for a high replay value.  Art is unique and beautiful, and the writing is consistently clever.  Pacing is excellent.  I finished my first playthrough in 2-3 hours, which felt just about right, given how many more times I want to go through it.Really my only disappointments were the lack of F/F romance potential, particularly in a so wonderfully lady-centric game (forget the prince; I wanted to marry the fairy!), and what felt like some untapped narrative potential regarding one of the major story branches (without getting into spoilers, there's a lot of vague but explicitly called-out foreboding around that branch, implying interesting and not necessarily pleasant consequences that don't seem to show up in the actual endings).

												I wouldn't say I LOVED this game but I liked it quite a bit so it's enough for a postive review.  -  The artwork and backgrounds were just stunning.  You could get caught up in just looking at the visuals of this game.  Just wow.  Amazing good.  I wanted to screenshot everything, it was just so beautiful to look at. - There are four or five different endings which are pretty interesting and give it a good playback value. - If you take your time, Cinders takes about four or five hours to complete per round.  - Very fitting soundtrack music.  It's nice and relaxing - which says a lot because I normally have to turn down or turn off the music because of getting annoyed.  I didn't have to in this game. - It's a great game to play before bed since it's a visual novel - it's very relaxing and doesn't take a lot of energy to play.  You can just read and make some choices here and there.  - It's very different from ""Disney's Cinderella."" It's a complete retelling of the story, so you won't get bored reading it likely and it's fairly decently written - it's entertaining at least and some fun options by the end and cool characters.  They are not completely one-dimensional.			"

												If you like visual novels, Cinders is definitely worth checking out. Not only are the visuals astounding, but the writing is solid.  It's an overall fun, mature (but *no nudity!*)  twist on the Cinderella story. The characters have great depth (depending on how you play the game), and there's several differnet paths and combinations you can take that maximize the playthrough value. One aspect that might be frustrating is that the game does not make obvious what the different personality choices are coded as. For example, is the choice you picked ""good,"" ""bad,"" or ""naive?"" The lack of labelling makes the game a bit more challenging to get all the endings. If you are looking for a quick playthrough for 100% completion, you may have to go online if you don't want to do it through trial and error.Overall amazing game with great relationships, story, and visuals. Highly recommended for those who like VNs or those who are looking to get into the VNs.			"

												A little gem of a visual novel with fairy tale roots. The art is gorgeous and the writing is usually good, although sometimes dialogue slips into unintentional hilarity.

As far as faults go, there are a few typos -  somewhat jarring in a text-based visual novel. A definite thumbs-up overall, though. "

												Cinders: 8/10.Cinders is a Visual Novel game, telling the tale of Cinderella. I'll be honest, I don't know much about the original story, so I can't say how close it follows that story (all I can say for sure is that there are ""evil"" stepsisters and stepmother, and the whole ""glass slipper"" part, everything else I'm not familiar with), but the story presented in Cinders was very well done. During my three and a half hour playthrough, I had to choose between one of four endings, and many other side plots (such as romantic interests, how you interact with with your stepsisters, etc.). While most of your choices don't mean much in the grand scheme of things, I did appreciate the fact that you are presented with a fair amount of choices, and multiple interesting choices for each (for example, do I want to lower the price with the shopkeeper by haggling, being seductive, appealing to friendship, or just pay full price? And then, if you do get to lower the price, do you spend that money (which is your stepmother's) on yourself, or give it to her?).One thing that I really enjoyed, that I haven't seen in my limited experience in VNs, is that the game tells you (visually, with a flower that is displayed in the top right of the screen) when you view a conversation that can have different outcomes. This, combined with the fact that you can super fast-forward through text you've already seen, means that it gave me a big enough incentive to replay the game multiple times. With four different endings, and multiple other minor differentiations, I ended up spending about eight hours total.While not important, the graphics are very impressive. Not only this, but characters are animated as are minor background pieces. This game definitely delivers in the ""Eye Candy"" department in the Humble Bundle I got it in.I can't think of anything negative about the game...it is a VN, so this game won't be for everyone, but for what it is, it does it well. I would recommend this game, if you're into stories and/or VNs.			"

												I wanted to like this game. A visual novel retelling of Cinderella, with beautiful graphics, the opportunity to come to see the characters in a new light, and a rather rewarding UI innovation that tells you whenever the dialogue snippet you're seeing could have gone differently had you chosen differently at some earlier juncture, making the game feel much more interactive.Alas, I couldn't, for the game had too many things that broke my immersion. The protagonist, like the classic Cinderella, is supposed to be living in a small medieval village and have been working basically as a servant for her family for the last several years, yet when she speaks to her stepsisters, she sounds as if she had been reading several books worth of modern pop psychology. At one point she even tells one of her stepsisters, ""you are the unknown variable in this equation"". Just how did she and her stepsister (who seems to understand the expression just fine) have the chance to learn algebra?Furthermore, although the process of Cinders winning over her stepsisters and allowing us to see them as people who had their reasons for treating Cinders badly could have been an enjoyable subversion of the original story, things seem to happen much too easily. At least with one of the stepsisters, the process starts with a conversation where Cinders basically asks whether the stepsister has considered that it would be nicer for everyone if they could be friends, and the stepsister goes ""oh, you're right"". (It's been a little while between me playing the game and writing the review, so I might misremember the details slightly, but even if they're a little off, this is still a good characterization of how sensible the conversion came off as.)I finally stopped playing in a dialogue when a conversation with one of the stepsisters seemed to be going well, but suddenly she started lashing out at me for no reason. That could have been intentional, but it looked more like a bug. Ordinarily that wouldn't have been a game-killer and I could have just gone back to an earlier save to see if I could get around it somehow, but with this game, it was the final straw.			"

												Cinders is a beautiful visual novel with so many different variations through the story. Furthermore you also have the choice to choose her personality instead of typically leaning towards the good girl fairy tale archetype. It appears that little decisions you make actually have an impact on the story. The scenes and characters are also beautiful and amazing to look at as you're playing the game. Re-playing through it can open up slight variations of dialogue depending on what you're choosing and how that differed from other playthroughs.			"

You, acting as Cinders, would face consequences by the choices and decisions you’ve made throughout the narration. In comparison to the classic fairy-tale of Cinderella, it’s more reflective, serious, and more mature in approach.Pros:*For the most part, the game has carried out the fascinating fairy-tale of Cinderella*Story rich game play with nice graphics/art style and with excellent soundtracks*The twist of the story is clever and unpredictable, especially with it’s ending (haven’t expected such finale wew!)*Great choice for those gamers who also takes pleasure in storybooks as a child*There is wisdom in some sorts of story line...Cons:*Repeated background and environment*The dialogue seems too monotonous*You can’t replay your decisions haha!*At odds, the romance is not that enchanting as anticipated from the bookMoreover, t’was a pleasant game!

												OVERALL - 8/10. First note this is after completing all paths, and alternate endings/etc. So this is a full review on the entire game and my personal opinion/s.I'd suggest the game to others but I have played better VN's for the same price with artwork that was just as well done, which had voice acting and a longer story. Cinders feels short but it does have a good story/alternate endings.Artwork - 9.5/10.* Cinders' facial anatomy is uneven in an unnattractive way and some expressions make her eyes rotate which uh they don't do in real life. Also the prince has a lazy eye.* Overall graphically the game looks great. It really does, it has a french painting type feel to the entire game, and it has wonderful coloring/shading Though the ballgowns were lazy recolorings with different lace/necklaces. Boring. Where's the creativity!?Story/Gameplay - 8/10. * The story does change depending on what choice you make, but without looking up the wikia page of Cinders, there's  no way of knowing what skill you gain or didn't gain by choosing that option. It isn't always obvious what the smart/bad/good choices were. * Having a meter on the left side of the page would be super helpful as there's a lot of unused space there. (Spoiler following.) (Getting the ""fair"" queen ending especially, as well as the Machiavellic Queen endings. First playthrough I had the Evil queen four times before figuring out what I was doing wrong. :/ Not fun. It made things extremely frustrating for me. * Half point loss for me is lacking the ability to go back and see moments such as the (spoiler)Ball gowns and dancing with the prince at the end of the game.. For me collecting the extra scenes/memories is half the fun in VN's. Cinders lacks this.* Half point loss also goes to the fact that the game controls are NOT the same as -most- other VN's, Having skip be keybound to left CTRL is a major annoyance, as the windows key is right beside it for my computer. :/  plus due to the location of the windows key on a US based keyboard. left control is not optimal.[/spoiler]Music - 6/10. * The music does not loop seamlessly and it is quite noticeable, not to mention there is NO IN GAME VOLUME ADJUSTMENT OPTION. The game's music by default is -too loud.- This game lacks voice acting, so I did expect more out of the music in the game. Possible Bugs and updates to think about? - * When in the options menu, right clicking in attempt to return back to the game. causes the screen resolution of the game in windowed mode to switch resolution, which might be intentional but is very annoying especially to those of us who play many other VN's and right click normally exits menus/enters them no matter which page you're on. * The steam overlay is missing the ability to resize itself to the size of the window, meaning that it's rendered entirely useless the user is playing in full screen, which some may do, but I personally dislike doing as I often have friends in other chat clients, and as such may need to alt-tab to a different window. There's a fix for this although I'm not sure how, I do know that it does resize in other games however.* The text speed is uneven at times or lags and suddenly slingshot-text superspeeds across the UI screen, which made me skip several lines while on autoplay in Normal. AND I could not scroll back far enough to re-read/ There's no actual Script page with the full scene. As such - had I not already played Cinders once, I would have been entirely lost on the story. There's a limit to how fast a person can read, even on the Normal speed it would randomly speed up. Also the auto  play option did not last long enough/went past long paragraphy sentences in the same amount of time for a short sentence. Again made me miss some text. This isn't new to the steam release either. It's been there since I purchased the game originally. Pleeaaaase at the very least fix this.* If you attempt to skip text by pressing control once or twice the dialogue box disappears entirely, which obviously skipping text so whatever. But - when doing so sometimes the UI text box would be -gone- which also made the text-skip for that part of the game super quick. Bug methinks.---As a final note:I'd like to mention that the Cinders for letting older users get Cinders on Steam instead of having to repurchase. :) That is  awesome.			"

												Absolutely beautiful twist on the classic Cinderella tale, for once you can choose to not be the pretty princess, you may end up as something completely different. The characters all have different personalities and will truly act on your interactions with them.  Also the art and soundtrack is just great, looking forward to play this again for another ending soon.			"

												Grabbed this on sale a while back, just started playing it last couple of days. It is TOTALLY worth the full price, I am so excited for Solstice to come out. Gorgeous art, atmospheric music, impressive depth and complexity to (most of) the characters and the story, loads of replayability and while you can skip stuff you've already seen by tappin' ctrl, I found myself wanting to see how stuff flowed into new choices and held off on the ctrl a few times on my way to the achivements as a result. I even ended up doing a couple playthroughs after I'd earned not just all the achievements but also 100% on all the options for every ending, just to see certain specific combos play out in the story instead of just selecting what the ending slide would look like if I'd done that particular combo (altho maybe that's just me, YMMV). tl;dr no brainer purchase on sale, nothing to lose/rich inner worlds of suffering, healing, cruelty and compassion to gain...but you shoud buy it anyway			"

												This VN definitely is one of the best I've played. Ever. The art is wonderful, the music top-notch, and the story fun. I have always enjoyed new takes on fairy tales, and I really like how this lets you put your own spin on things. Want to imprison the evil stepmother and take back the house (and NOT marry the prince)? You can do that. Marry the prince and have the stepmother as an advisor? You can do that, too. The various ways this can go are a bit of a balancing act of inter-character relationships, which keeps things interesting. A lot of experimentation yeilds all sorts of ways to make or break relationships. Definitely fun, with lots of replay value!			"

												I've played through a majority of the game by now (and would like to continue until I'm all finished) and I must say it's quite engaging and unique. Some parts seem a little boring but that usually changes pretty fast. All the characters are quite interesting, especially Sophia, who is probably the most fun to speak to, and also the shady character, who I wish we knew more about. I don't agree with all of the characterization that is done in this game and all its paths, but I can appreciate them nonetheless.I do wish there were some other options for Cinder (maybe less of some and more of others) and that it was perhaps a little longer, and I don't like every part of it, but it's a good game, I'd rate it a solid 7/10 or 8/10, depending on what path you choose. The art is brilliant, as well as the music, and the atmosphere the game itself creates is very inspiring! I enjoy reading, so this was pleasant, though I could see some people getting more bored, more often, than I did. It does have its faults (I spotted one or two spelling errors), but it's got quite a few hours of fun in it.(Sidenote: I bought this when it was on sale, and I'd recommend others do the same if they get the chance.)

												Cinders is an amazing visual novel. It’s based on Cinderella, but you have a great amount of control over how the story progresses. Fairy godmother? You have more than one option, or can forgo help altogether. Want to kill your stepmother? Go ahead! Of course, it also depends on how you go about it - just because you try doesn’t mean you’ll succeed! Even if you choose to mostly follow the original story, there are subtleties that will result in different endings.The art is also spectacular. It’s just so pretty! I’ve actually used a wallpaper from it on my gaming PC for over a year, and still love it. And, unusual for visual novels, it isn’t anime/manga styled art.I just can’t say enough good things about it. I’ve played it so many times and gotten most endings and permutations, though I still have a few left. I highly highly recommend checking it out, even if you haven’t played a visual novel before.

												Pros:-As everyone has said before me, the art is beautiful. The music is pretty good too. No problems on the technical side--skipping and transitions always went smoothly. -The characters are very fleshed out and put together well. I found the step-sisters to be my favorite. The love interests are rather stereotypical, but not always predictable. -The story is fun and intriguing. Definitely a mature telling of the Cinderella story. I feel like you could enjoy it regarless of interests and gender (mentioning as several guys seem to worried this game is too ""girly""). -Decent length. Can't remember my exact time of my first run, but I think it was somewhere around 4 hours or more (my on-record-hours are off by several). Neutral-Many of the game's choices change character personality rather than storyline--which is an interesting decision. The result is different flavoring in the endings. -The replay-ablity is decent. I'd say you could get 3 pretty solid play-throughs before too much of it starts to repeat. -Writting is better than it is worse. Though some converstation is too drawn out (see below). Cons:-Cinder's posture is TERRIBLE. Stand up straight, gurl. I caN'T STAND IT.-As mentioned by several, the game does get preachy at times in conversation, making is feel tedious. However, I can appreciate WHY I assume the creators have done this-- its a genuine attempt to created character and relationships. Is it successsful? Not completely, but most VNs I've played just throw you headfirst into relationships with little to no development; so I'm glad they tried, even if it didn't totally work out that way. All-in-all: A good visual novel. The asking price is a tad steep, but I wouldn't hestitate to pick it up if it goes on a sale.			"

												Cinders is a visually appealing modern take on the Cinderella fairytale.  It did a great job of including occasional social commentary without detracting from the overall flow of the narrative.  I enjoy anime but hadn't delved into visual novels, until Cinders.  The slight changes in movement and expressions of the character portraits, music, and the overall storyline kept me engaged, without feeling like I was trudging through a glorified illustrated book.  The decisions that you make actually change the storyline and the interactions between characters.  Choices in the game also come up often enough that you’re not reading for extended periods of time and sitting as a passive observer, but rather as an active participant.  Although the option to “fast forward” through text made completing alternate storylines a relatively quick process, I would have preferred the option to “skip” text and scenes entirely or the ability to move directly to bookmarked decision points. I consider this a fun and endearing introduction to visual novels because of the familiar, yet engaging theme.  It also created a spark of interest in other visual novels. The inclusion and portrayal of characters derived from African/Afro-Caribbean  traditions and beliefs was a very pleasant suprise.			"

												An awesome game! Probably the best graphic novel/dating sim that I've ever played. I like that all the characters in this game have depth, even the supposed villains. And while there's a number of people you can ""date"", you have to be very clear on your path with them to get the best endings. There are also paths where you don't end up with anyone at all. All of your actions really do have consequences. The game is extremely well made. The graphics are stunning and the background sounds work well. The game runs very smoothly and so far, every storyline I've played has been enjoyable. There were a few times in the game where I felt the dialogue got a bit preachy. The writers obviously really wanted to push the idea that Cinders was strong and independent, but at times it was like they were beating you over the head with it. Don't get me wrong, I love this game and I LOVE the fact that it actually has a strong female protagonist and that the goal of the game isn't necessarily to end up with a man. I think a little bit of subtlety would have gone a long way. "

This feature didn't work at all after coming out of a skip sequence.The skip feature would stop at scene changes. There's a lot of those.The ""this could be changed"" flower was obnoxious and unclear during skip sequences.I found a lot of the men's fashion to be unappealing and boring; those dudes just weren't that interesting to look at but that just might be my preference.That noise that happens during scene changes with the flute really gets annoying.

The many different paths and endings you can achieve give the game a high level of replayability, along with the the ever so hand ""skip"" button (which stops automatically whenever you encounter a new scene or piece of dialogue you haven't seen before.)This is a visual novel where your choices really do matter. Every component of your relationships with other characters and personal character choices influence the ending you receive. My only complaint is that the price is a little steep, and I was lucky to have gotten this game while it was on sale.10/10 I would reccomend this to all lovers of visual novels, fairy tales, and dark stories. This isn't your average fairy tale :)			"

												For me, making decisions in conversations and having those decisions affect the rest of the story is the best part of RPGs, and this game/genre takes that mechanic from that genre and cuts out everything else, including the boring grinding.  Add to that the beautiful artwork, and this is just an excellent game.  I do wish it were longer though.  It took me 3 hours, has little replayability, and I spent $10 on it.  $3.33/fun-hour is not a great ratio.			"

												If you've never played a visual novel, and you're interested in doing so, this isn't a bad option to start with. The artwork is stunning, and the secondary characters well rounded and nuanced if you delve into their stories. I didn't care that much for the protagonist, and was generally more interested in the secondary characters, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the game overall.I played through a number of times within 8 hours, unlocking all the achievements. However, I only got 1 card drop in that time, and have had to run the game since then to get the remainder of my cards.			"

												Overall this is a great game!The artwork and overall style is fantastic.The interface is simple and intuitive.The sound effects were above average. I muted the music, but tend to do so in every game. Other sounds were excellent with the exception of the tavern. It is a rather short loop, and becomes repetitive.Your first game can take ~3 hours to complete. Subsequent games go quickly as the Ctrl key allows portions of text you've previously read to be skipped.My two complaints:One - The writing. The writing is not bad, it just needs improvement. There are quite a few typos; you can easily discern what is meant, but they are a distraction. To the developer's credit, there is a discussion in the community hub where typos can be submitted, but this game was released a few years ago, and more than enough typos remain to make me wonder if a patch was ever applied. Where is the game text stored? I'll edit typos for a reasonable rate.With typos removed, I find the readability level directed towards younger readers. You won't find many big words, or stretch your vocabulary. This is not bad, as it makes for an easy read, and likely makes for a larger audience. I would have preferred the text to be geared more towards an adult audience.Two – Some of the Choices / PathsOne that stands out to me is Cinders relationship with her younger sister Sophia. In one playthrough I felt I made some real progress in rebuilding a normal relationship between the two. But come the next morning when Sophia actively seeks to spend time with me, I have to tell her that I was planning on some alone time in town; maybe next time kid?... We were just getting somewhere!

												Overall, I would recommend this game. The art style is absolutely beautiful. Cinders provides an alternative to the manga/anime style visual novels. Plus, it revolves around a tweaked version of the classic fairy tale Cinderella. Fairy tales and their various retellings are interesting. This game allows you to take charge of that retelling.  However, the writing is not always great. I think at 19.99 the game is a bit overpriced, but not drastically so.			"

OK, it's a little stilted in places, but that's fine.  It still feels right.There are a reasonable amount of choices to make and the outcomes are varied enough to make those choices meaningful and interesting.I'm fully intending to go back and play through this multiple times to explore the other endings and dig deeper into the lives of the characters.  This is a sweet morsel of deliciousness.			"

												Cinders is a storybook style game aimed towards a person who can appreciate a fairy tale experienced through the eyes of a woman.The presentation is wonderful, and the decisions feel as if they have enough weight to them so that you'll want to play through the story several times to experience everything.The game is very short, only a few hours long.  I purchased it on sale and I personally had no issues with the cost, but I can see how others may be put off by the short game when compared to price tag.Cost aside, Cinders was my first storybook game and I was pleasently suprised by how much I enjoyed the experience!

												This game takes a well-known story and transforms it by taking a nuanced and humanizing approach to every character, and by allowing you to work towards an impressive variety of endings. Replaying it to unlock every variation can start to drag even with the skip function for dialogue you've already viewed, but the fact that I was immersed enough to want to unlock them anyway counts as a positive in my opinion. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys visual novels with a bit of depth.			"

												While the whole thing is absolutely for women, I'm not one to shy-away from trying something that could be interesting for me too. It's basically a graphical novel with branching paths based on your choices. It has tons of endings and that gives it its replayability, although having to go through scenes that you've already seen before means you'll be probably be replaying by just constantly mashing the skip-button. Still, the story's mature and makes sense, it definitely won't wear you out. Unlike some *cough* Final Fantasy *cough* games.			"

This visual novel also goes deeper than typical ""girly"" ones, as not everything is all about being ""liked"" by a romantic interest or another, but also understand the people evolving around you, because, maybe even the evil step-mother actually has goals and aspirations that might not be that far from yours.

They could easily switch some dialogue to choice prompts even if those choices wouldn't 'make a difference' per se, it would still be something to look forward to. In the whole time I played (3ish hours) I made about 10 choices and honestly it felt like less. I can't be certain about the number of choices because I just can't remember - I cared so little one way or another.I wanted to read it, I really did, and I hated putting it down but with 3.2 hours of play time down I just can't bring myself to finish it. It reads like a long winded childrens book. I don't know what age group they are going for but it's too dull for tweens and too juvinielle for adults.			"

												It seems like most visual novels are about being a guy and trying to romance the women. Flipping that mechanic on its head was kind of interesting. This game had some weak writing at points, but the characters felt real. Like they were written by someone with world experience. Villians don't have to be viillans because they wear a black cape and hate people. Maybe they're not really villians at all. But it was a fun story and it has a wide variety of highly different endings, so that your choices during the game actually make a very big difference. You can shoot for the traditional Cinderella route, or you can chart an entirely new course and run off into a different lifestyle, or more. However, in any case, I am content to read about the alternate endings rather than actually redo the entire game. I wouldn't mind playing another game from these people if they could edit out some of the slow points.			"

Evil step mom, wicked step sisters, princes looking for marriage.  It doesn't take long for 'Cinders' to reveal itself as a retelling of the classic Cinderella story.  Only this time the player is the one putting on the shoes of the main character 'Cinders'.  Drawing from a well known source is a great boon to players new to visual novels allowing them to start off with a foundation of understanding for the core characters.As a visual novel players will be required to do a lot of reading between choices which in cinders happen about every 5~10 minutes.  The game notifies you when you make a choice the causes a branch in the story which is very appreciated.			"

												A more mature and realistic take on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella.  Ever wonder why the stepmother is mean, despite  being  a single aging noble trying to keep her house together?  Ever wonder why the Stepsisters are cold and bitter? maybe they don't have it so great either!  No, this is not disney where everything is black and white.  This is a great take on Cinderella, where if you really want to you can try to live the classic fairy tale and marry the prince at the end, but why do that when you could fix the relationship with your stepsisters? or screw the prince, go for the ruggedly handsome captain of the guard instead! your call.  Very enjoyable experience, with characters who act realistically and a great style of art.  (I especially love the Scoundrel's hat!!)			"

Cinders is a very well written game with absolutley gourgeos character and background art. It really stands out from the herds of anime-esque visual novels out there. The story is a refreshing take on Cinderella with complex characters and situations that will have you questioning the choices you make. And with its many branching paths, there's a lot to discover by going back and choosing different options. Give this game a chance, you won't regret it.			"

												I loved the art and music in this visual novel. The family characterization makes subsequent play throughs interesting. I could not have cared less about the love interests in this game. However, better skipping between choices after replays would have kept the completionist in me happy. I couldn't bring myself to play through every ending. I also wish I wasn't forced to go through the ball every playthrough. As it is, I didn't finish all paths.			"

												Not quite was I hoping for, but if you can catch it on sale, I'd recommend it.Cinders is not the typical Cinderella and seems a bit bitter with life.The art in this game for the female characters is excellent, though the males seemed a bit stiff and lifeless in my opinion.The step family seemed the most interesting to me, cold but not entirely wicked, I would have liked to explore their stories more.

												Friends of mine were showering this game with praise a couple of years back. I wasn't interested in visual novels, so I had passed on it at that time. I'm glad I picked it up now! Cinders is a very well written game with absolutley gourgeos character and background art. It really stands out from the herds of anime-esque visual novels out there. The story is a refreshing take on Cinderella with complex characters and situations that will have you questioning the choices you make. And with its many branching paths, there's a lot to discover by going back and choosing different options. Give this game a chance, you won't regret it.			"

												Cinders was a neat take on the tried and true Cinderella story. The art was unique and good, with the exception of the male characters who were... unsettling.

												TL;DR: Beautiful game with a lot of player agency but not labeled correctly by the devs and 'flat' romances.I really liked playing this game and I would warmly recommend it to any VN fans out there. That's not to say it's without faults but it's a very good take on the genre.Pros:- The artwork. It's gorgeous, it's original, it's great.- Player agency. You have choices and they matter (GASP!). You get to see the consequences of some choices soon after making them, other later on but it's so rewarding to have a story that can go in so many different directions.- Endings. No 'secret' or 'true' ending, your choices can lead to an ending that fully reflects the kind of character you wanted Cinder to be and that ending can be good or bad depending on your actions.- The NPCs. They are more than one-trick ponies whose one-sided personality is the end-all be-all of whom they are.- Info. The information you get from certain actions can be used later on, if you choose, leading to a lot of branching in how you play.Cons:- The labels. It's NOT an RPG. Labeling it as such is misleading to people who are looking for RPGs in the store. It's a visual novel, do not be fooled. (Yes, you take on the 'role' of Cinder but then EVERY game is an RPG and the label loses its meaning, not helping anyone anymore.)- The romance. If you're gonna add romance options, make them good. There could have been more depth to this aspect of the game as a lot of it was not as fleshed out as I could have wished.- The variation. With so much variations there's a lot of aspects of the story that are simply introduced and then not really explored, this is a real shame as some of them are really interesting.In conclusion: I don't have a lot of gripes with this game as I truly enjoyed it. There's a lot of consideration for player input and choices and if you enjoy visual novels, I definitely think you'll like this.			"

												This is a very unique take to this fairy tale, if the story and character interactions weren't enough to make this one of my favorite visual novels to date then the artwork would certainly keep it up there, it's beautifully done characters and background are also some of my favorite that's why I'd give this a 10/10 if you like visual novels or different takes on classic fairy tales then give this a shot I doubt it'll disappoint you.

												Altogether this game was kind of a disappointment. I found it difficult to navigate the choices in order to get a happy ending that I was satisfied with. I was forced to go online and look for a guide, but even then it didn't really help. Spoiler(?):Also, if you wanted to go for the more traditional Cinderella ending, there is no interaction with the Prince until the finale of the game at the Ball which I found it highly disatisfying. The only point I can say in the game's favor is that the artwork is unique, but it doesn't offer much beyond that. Bottom line, I would not recommend spending mone on this game.			"

												I was surprised with how good the story ended up, compared with how much I dislike the source material. It made the story of Cinderealla actually make sense. For the most part, it is well-written, and there are multiple endings. However, I think the full price (around $20) is a bit steep because there is limited replayability, and the overall story is fairly short. But considering the quality of the game and not the price, I would say the game is a solid 8/10.Pros:+ Great story, and above average writing.+ Memorable characters, each with their own agendas, problems, and personalities.+ Good graphics.+ Plenty of choices to make the game feel interesting, and enough endings to reward your choices.Cons:- The price. I'd encourage waiting for a sale.- It's a Visual Novel. I happen to like VNs, but if you are looking for a 'game' as opposed to a story, you will be disappointed. "

												Cinders is a very beautiful game, probably one of the most gorgeous games I have played.  It is not only an amazing visual novel with a dark, mature take on the story of Cinderella, but also contains elements of dating sims and roleplay as well.  I really enjoyed the wide ranges of decisions to make along with the variations of multiple endings.  Not to mention the dialogue is very well written, with very deep philosophical tones and also some comical moments as well - especially with a few fourth wall breakings.  All in all, this is a very good visual novel and certainly won't be disappointing.Pros:- Beautiful artwork - every character and background is absolutely gorgeous- Nice subtle animation - it really helps bring the novel to life and draws more attention - Amazing soundtrack - I would purchase the soundtrack if they offered it - Interesting Storyline - has a nice, dark twist to Cinderella while also including elements such as identity, self-empowerment, independence, decisions, and more.  It's not only a story, it's plenty of food for thought as well.- Variety of Decisions - there are so many to make and it really helps drive the story in different directions, which makes things all the more interesting.- Great Character Development - all of the characters have a distinct appearance and personality and it really shows not only visually, but in their dialogue.  It's fascinating to get to know them and it also helps them feel very real.  This part was truly amazing.- Replay Value - you get different achievements from different decisions and different endings, so there's a nice challengeCons:- The dialogue can get a little repetitive at some points.  There's some parts where a character will emphasize something and then it will be emphasized again and again.  This part makes the subject they're emphasizing a little too drawn out.  - Replay Value can feel tedious if already played through trying to get the achievements.  - Personally, I wish it was longer.  Overall, this is a very charming visual novel with many great qualities in terms of aesthetic artwork, intriguing storyline, and heartfelt character development.			"

The music is perfectly suited to each scene, and the choices you make have an effect on later events and character relationships (which is cleverly indicated to you by a symbol that discreetly appears - a function that I think all VNs should have).

												Good VN in the ""realistic fairytale subversion"" genre.Pros:+ Art. Nice to look at, although lip animation sometimes crosses the uncanny valley+ Music. Matches the tone perfectly. While not much on its own, it really adds to overall presentation.+ Story. Let's just say it's interesting.+ Choice. Multiple branching paths. You won't see all the game has to offer even after several playthroughs. Replayability is high.+ Characters are believable, for the most part.+ Strong, if a bit Mary Sue-ish, female protagonist.Cons:- Protagonist is a little Mary Sue-ish. It's expected, but may be a turn-off for some.- No voiceover.- Some choices, while seem important, don't affect much at all. This is more of a nitpick though.Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys branching storytelling.			"

												I have just reached the first outcome in the game. I liked it. I do intend to play it again. My wallet is not a land of abundance, so the price kept me away. Recently there was a promotion, however, so I bought Cinders and Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines for around 15 euros. I do not regret it. While playing Cinders, my view of the characters changed. This isn't easy to do while keeping a plot consistent, but the author did it. What I liked the most is how Cinders's personality was influenced by my choices. I cannot tell for certain, as I have only gone through 1 path as of now, but in restrospective, the outcome seems quite fitting for the choices I made.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As you can see, this review has been edited. As of now,I have played Cinders long enough to have seen most of the outcomes (and I have every achievment except for one), and my opinion of the game is still the same. It was worth every penny.

												A more mature and realistic take on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella.  Ever wonder why the stepmother is mean, despite  being  a single aging noble trying to keep her house together?  Ever wonder why the Stepsisters are cold and bitter? maybe they don't have it so great either!  No, this is not disney where everything is black and white.  This is a great take on Cinderella, where if you really want to you can try to live the classic fairy tale and marry the prince at the end, but why do that when you could fix the relationship with your stepsisters? or screw the prince, go for the ruggedly handsome captain of the guard instead! your call.  Very enjoyable experience, with characters who act realistically and a great style of art.  (I especially love the Scoundrel's hat!!)			"

												Overall rating: 9.5/10To anyone who enjoys visual novels/choose your own adventure stories, I cannot recommend this game highly enough.Story:In terms of story, they did an excellent job weaving a narrative that places the story of Cinderella in a context that makes sense. Your stepmother and stepsisters are more than just villians, they are characters/people with lives and motivations that you can choose to understand/learn about or not. The other characters you meet in the story also have histories and distinct personalites. Cinders' relationships with other characters are also affected by choices you make. References to the past/history are very fluidly revealed in conversations with people. The game does not just dump a bunch of backstory on you for seemingly no reason. The game is also filled with some excellent dry humor, and amusing banter.Gameplay:If there is a game where literally every choice has an impact, big or small, this is it. There are multiple personality types for Cinders (I've discovered three) that are shaped by the choices you make. Cinders' personality type will affect certain dialogues, the availability of certain choices, and the consequences of certain choices. Certain scenes or dialogues with other characters will also change depending on previous choices you have made. There are multiple endings with several variants of each, and it does not come down to one or two ""big choices"" at the end or anything simple like that. Whether or not you succeed in achieving your desired specific ending is dependent upon the cumulative effects of choices you have made throughout the game. That being said, the replay value is very high, in my opinion. I have enjoyed replaying it to find the different endings/variants and get the achievements.The only downsides in terms of gameplay are minor, but still exist. There is no good ""rewind"" function. If you missed a line, or want to return to read an earlier part of the conversation, you are limited. The game is divided into ""scenes"" probably for program/design sake. However, you cannot scroll further back than the first line of your current ""scene."" This could be several lines back, or just one. Fast-forward is sub-optimal. It just cycles through dialogue at rapid speed until you come to a scene/line you haven't viewed or a choice. You can't ""skip to next scene"" or ""skip to next choice"" which is disappointing on replays.Presentation:The artwork is pretty, from the character portraits to the backgrounds and facial expressions change over the course of conversations. The music is good, and fits the scenes quite well. My only gripe was that introducing a character meant briefly interrupting a scene to focus on the character on a leafy-flower design background and a change in music that felt a little out of place.Pros:+ Story+ Characters+ Artwork+ Choices & Consequences+ Replay ValueCons:- Limited/sub-optimal fast-forward and rewind functions- Awkward character ""introductions""			"

												I'm not very impressed with this game and while parts are nice or ok, I think the story and characters - something visual novels rely on a great deal - are very poor. The art is quite nice, music is nice but gets repetitive quickly, the dialogue works at times but has a lot of bad moments and repeats a lot of things unnecessarily for example. The story seems to be trying to push this ""strong independent woman"" theme in such a ham-fisted way I cringed, it's laughably badly written in parts and there is nothing subtle from characterization to foreshadowing and plot.The characters aren't conceptually bad, but end up unlikable and uninteresting in how they are used and, primarily, how they are written with dialogue that makes them entirely 2 dimensional. The choices you make for the main character don't seem like her choices but something someone is forcing her to do. I don't play a lot of visual novels but I've played some in the past and don't have anything against them, in fact liking some a lot (like Steins;Gate and Katawa Shoujo). This is not one of them and I do not recommend you play this unless you like being told what is right and how you should live your life by almost every character in an extremely preachy way - and what they preach is not exactly morally justifiable even; other reviews detail how the game consistently tells the player/main character that the abuser (the stepmother) is in the right and you should feel bad for wanting to rebel against her and take the house that is legally yours.To clarify on my play length, I stopped playing after an hour and looked up videos to see if it got better, and from the conversations and scenes that I saw, it got worse so I didn't return.

												The Quick: Became Clicker Heroes for me fast. Click, click, click.  Where's the perspective???? Overall Ranking: 6/10DETAILEDPros:+Visually looks appealing.+A good amount of characters.+4 different themed endings.+ Nice color palettes.+Characters fit in their environment stylistically.+Appealing music.+Sometimes more than two choices to go through.+Some choices impact story well.+Achievements easy to get.+ Don't have to end up with the prince, can be with two other male characters.+Have Cinder being  independent, endings.+During Steam Sale, game was cheap.+UI Design was nice.+Liked the trophies that would appear in main screen.+Can choose between the Fairy or Madam Ghede path.+Like that Stepmom and sisters aren't always seen as bad, depending on path taken.+Movement outside windows to give some life to setting.+Nice textureCons:-  38 Variations of the 4 styled endings, which end up seeming repetitive except for the last few parts of that version of the story.-Some character's body proportions seemed fairly off or disturbing. (Prince's head to body ratio, ""Shady Man's"" thumbs are tremendously long.-Clothing is weird on ""Shady Man"". Looks like it is really tight by his parts.- Some character's body alignment is off. Cinder's neck and some of chest is facing right, but then her lower torso is facing leftwards and then her lower clothing suggests she is to the right which makes for awkward twisting in the body. Many other characters have that issue.- Background has no atmospheric perspective. Everything looks sharp when farther away it shouldn't.-Perspective is off. Things would be way too big if moved to where character is standing. - Not enough saves for being a game with more then one styled ending. Usually with visual novels they have more saves then necessary but this one lacked!- Cannot name saves to keep better track of what is what.-Always have to go to the dang ball. I'm running away who cares!!- After two playthroughs, story becomes bleh and nothing new or interesting to the plate. All stories still have same structure and path to go on regardless of ending you are choosing to go towards.- Creepy eye movement from the Prince.-Carmosa's folding her arms looks very off in perspective, her left arm is not done right.- Needed more variation in poses. Only arm position or facial expression changed. Body stayed the same.-NO SKIP BUTTON. This was so annoying when trying to go back to get other endings.-Regular price is so not worth it. Payed $9.99 during Steam Sale and that was more decent based off the issues this game has.- Seems to drag in conversations where you don't get much say in.Based off of more cons thans pros would not recommend. The art may seem pretty at first but after playing it for awhile you start  to see all the mishaps making it less appealing. Story became bland after a couple playthroughs and dialogue rarely changed. If you want to experience this yourself go ahead but it is not as enticing as it looked. "

												Man, I really was looking forward to playing this game.Instead, I'm just glad I got this in a bundle and didn't pay full price. :XIt's... it's just really boring. There's only three romance options, and most of the story/dialogue takes place between Cinders and her stepsisters. Hardly any time spent with the romance options. Some decisions are also not as important as the game makes them out to be.			"

												If you are here because of the RPG tag then best move on as this game have nothing what differs a RPG from a Adventure.Cinders is a pure Vissual Novel with nice graphics but if you expect some kind of character system as some other VN have then there is nothing.The RPG flag was for me the main reason to upvote this game in greenlight but if developer consider games that have some choices that influence the ending already as RPG then over 50% of all games can be considered be a RPG.

												While there is an interesting story and beautiful art there aren't very many choices for the player to make. It feels like 75-85% of the time you are just clicking through dialogue that you have no control over and then suddenly the game is over. The game was alright and I'm sure the different endings will be interesting but considering how much the game costs and the lack of control you have over the story I wouldn't reccomend it.			"

												Basically a choose your own adventure story with very little emphasis on actual choices. The main focus of this tedious game is the copious amount of bland dialogue between completely boring characters. I hated EVERYONE in this game. Cinderella, her step-sisters, the guard, the merchant... everyone is either obsessively self-involved or completely dim-witted.  Actually the only halfway likeable character is the thief.  The dialogue is never-ending and very poorly written.  The choices are few and far between and I found myself desparately hitting ""enter"" to get through all the meaningless drivel just to finally click on some stupid decision like ""go on a date with the merchant or rush home.""  And yes I could have a completely different experience by playing the game again and making different choices, but the dialogue is SOOO bad that I can't imagine another 2-3 hours reading it.And for a supposed mordern retelling of an old fairytale it is remarkable sexist. Cinders is completely obsessed with shoes! I'm just glad I bought this in a humble bundle for cheap. Save your money and go read a real book.4/10 "

												I got this game in a humble bundle a wile back and I haven't even played a half hour of it. The reason for not having any play time is that this game is extreamly boring. The artwork it self is very pretty, but the animations are lazy and the story is slow and failed to capture my intrest what so ever. Not to mention that this game is $20... $20!?! are you fricking kidding me? I paid maybe $0.20 for the game and I still feel like it was a waste of money. Hell, I think I got more enjoyment playing Depression Quest.3/10 for Interesting artwork			"

												For a Visual Novel I expected something better than just a retelling of Cinderella, it was also a bit short for a visual novel. Though getting it from a bundle wasn't that bad of a deal and it's probably unfair for me to compare Cinders to Japanese visual novels.			"

												This is a tricky game to write a review for. I'm not giving a thumbs down because I believe this is a terrible game. I give it a thumbs down because I don't feel a lot of people would enjoy it and as such, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Personally, I had quite a bit of fun playing this.As a kid, I got the least-involved RPGs called Choose Your Own Adventure. You basically read a book and at the end of a page there will be a decision and another and so on and so forth until you have 20+ different endings. This game is basically that with some very pretty drawings to boot.			"

												I hated it. It's like a hidden objects game without any hidden objects or puzzles, and tons of talking with NO VOICE-OVERS. I know, I know, that's what it is: and interactive novel. But the interaction is so minimal that I felt like falling asleep in between each ""interaction""... I thought maybe it would be like those books where we're the hero, picking our way at every corner, but no. It's talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and talk some more... zzzz... Oh! Do I get to make a choice?! Let's see: ""Ask to know more about him?"" Uh... no, thanks. I've heard enough already... After only 20 minutes I already didn't care one way or another.It's not that it's bad (although it's WAY overpriced for what it is). The graphics area beautiful, but there aren't that many scenes -- actually a LOT less than in your average hidden objects games -- but I found the ""game"" boring, the story boring, and, like I said, there's not even voice-overs to keep you awake. I see we can play it again to get a different ending. I'll pass, thank you very much.			"

												Im all for narration based games, im all for beautiful artwork, i love adventure games(one of my fav genres), and even some hidden object games (top of the lazy genres), but this? You will click for hours, and hours, reading with barely any form of interacion beyond a dialogue choice or two...So even if your decisions do matter, how much? since you will just stare at still illustrations regardless...What im trying to say, this barely qualifies as a game, from any angle, yet is with the rest of the games. Nice story, nice art, hardly any game to speak of.Cattered to either a very niche or lost audience, i cannot recommend this to most of the world. Specially for the full on insane baseprice, and just because this is one of the most technically low effort game i´ve seen on steam. All presentation, very little gaming substance. Just youtube some gameplay footage, to experience the excitement...I guess i have to point the sarcasm.(Don't pay attention to the low agree %, spineless defenders of the ""game"" can't see objectively, cause someone's being objective about a product they like a little too much).

												Where did I get this? Is this a game? Why did I install it? All these questions and more are left without an answer. Anyone who actually paid money for this game probably was trying to buy something else. I can safely say that after 10 minutes of gameplay I was thoroughly satisfied with my decision to uninstall it forever. Left only as a never leaving stain hiding in a bin of games I labeled garbage so I wouldn’t have t look at it in the library.			"

												This was a horrible game with very old graphics.  Steam ssys release date is in 2014 but the graphics are like games from the 1980's.  I feel I was  misled. I spend a lot of money on Steam, and about 1 in three games are junk like this one.  There is no phone number to call to complain or get a refund.  I believe they should put the true dates the games were released, this is false advertisement.  Steam owes me a lot of refunds, but alas they conveinientlyy have no phone number, nor even a place on their website to direct you to the right place.  I am very unhappy with this sneaky way to sell people outdated, unwanted games.			"

												This is a great visual novel game with multiple endings and a variety of different paths to choose from as you play.The artwork is gorgeous, both the character designs and particularly the background scenery are very impressive.The soundtrack is great too with a wide range of pieces that draw out a variety of emotions suited to each scene, from tense moments to quiet peaceful mornings.The dialog is pretty solid and well written, I've definitely seen a lot worse in these kinds of games. The plot of the story is great, holds a lot of mystery and introduces a variety of interesting and distinct characters. With the varied endings, multiple playthroughs can be drastically different depending on the choices you make.I've only finished the game once and am on my second playthrough at the time of writing this review, but there are at least 3 possible ""romantic interests"" for Cinders to end up with that I can see, perhaps more that I have not realized yet.The dialog choices are interesting because it really feels like you get to shape the kind of personality that Cinders has, whether you choose to make her defiant and rebellious or more meek and complacent, or something in between. There is a lot of variety here and it helps create greater depth and adds to the replayability.Even if you haven't ever really played visual novel games before, Cinders would be a great choice to break into the genre. It has a lot to offer and does a lot of things well.			"

												This is a cute game and I really like the art.  It's basically a choose your own adventure book, not to be confused with the more interactive Telltale Games style.  My one complaint is that sometimes the conversations go on FOREVER.  With no action and nothing to do but click the screen so the next bit of dialogue comes up, it gets hidiously boring.  I keep playing because I do want to know how it turns out and how my choices change things but lord.  I feel like when I replay this with different choices it'll be about 75% shorter because of all the stuff I'll be fast forwarding through.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game because I've been waiting since it came out to get it. I downloaded the demo and I was ecstatic today when I finally bought it, but when I was downloading it my laptop died, and when it finished the game works(ish) but it doesn't fit everything onto the screen, I can't change the screen orientation, and when I click new game it doesn't even load the first set of choices after the dialogue. There is also no music and the tips at the beginning are cut off. I deleted local files and reinstalled it but the problems haven't been resolved. Help!			"

												It's not bad. Sort of like a text based adventure game. I didn't mind the changes to the original story, and I love the fact that you can make Cinders into a complete b*tch. Fun times. The art is fairly nice also, especially that of the backgrounds, sisters, fairy, and Ghede.Not sure if it would appeal to many people, but I'm one of those that must try to get all endings.3.5-4/5 maybe. Depending what you're into. I recommend to play this game at least once, assuming the fondness for these sorts of games.			"

												This is a lovely little game. Well, it's not really a game - more an interactive story. You click through listening to dialogue between the main characters and Cinders' thoughts, and, like a ""Choose your own Adventure"" novel, make choices at key points. That's pretty much it, as far as action is concerned.But it's such a nice experience that it doesn't matter. The dialogue seems a bit trite to begin with (and to be fair, is a bit stilted at times, with the odd sentence that sounds like it's been badly translated) but you soon grow to like it, and the story can go in one of several directions based on your choices. There aren't that many backdrops or characters altogether, but the art and music are so wonderful that it's really a pleasure to play through.Overall, I'd highly recommend this; it's just such a nice experience. Don't buy it, though, if you're expecting action, or puzzles, or a game - it isn't really any of those things. It's more like you're in the audience for a mysterious and beautiful piece of theatre that makes you feel like a little child listening to a storyteller.			"

												Cinders quenched my thirst for a fairytale story with characters who have depth and for the option to change how a classic story ends. Would you prefer to end up with this person, with that person, or on your own? Would you rather take charge of the kingdom, take back your home, or run away? You get to choose how this well written and beautifully brought to life story unfolds. During my first run, I chose to go with my first instincts on how to go through the game. It's fun to see how others go through the game as well. The friends I've sat in front of this game have all chosen very different paths for the sassy, independent main character in this Cinderella story.Overall, if you enjoy fairytales with a twist, try Cinders.P.S.By looking at the achievements I haven't yet gotten, it looks like you can choose a dark path. So, if you're not into the usual, happy trajectory of fairytales nowadays, there could still be something here for you.			"

												I love everything about this game, from the art style, to the storyline, to the amazing characters! I love how this game brings a new life to the story of Cinderella in a more mature way. I really liked the story progression and how you got to make a lot of decisions to help move the story along.And the art style, omg, the art style is beautiful! It's like nothing I've ever seen before!My only complaint would be, playing the game back to try get the different endings is very time consuming and a bit unncessary.To conclude, if you like reading, good story telling, a twist on a classic fairytale, and amazing art then this is the game for you!
