												It's hard to describe why Dark Souls is so, so good.Yet, it's so incredibly easy.Why? We just need to look at the core attitude of Dark Souls, from a design-to-player perspective.Dark Souls is challenging. Yes, that much is clear. But it's not to laugh at you or to discourage you.It's hard because it knows what you're capable of, and it believes in you. It doesn't want you to give up.Despite killing you all the time, it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard. Dark Souls wants you to succeed, and this gives it the framework to do so many things right.In that regard, Dark Souls does absolutely no hand holding in almost every aspect. The story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you don't take the time to read item descriptions, examine the world, and talk to every NPC you meet. You will be torn apart if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield. Most of all, if you don't take your time, you will be seeing YOU DIED a lot as well. The game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses: it wants you to slow down, weigh all of your options, experiment, and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive.Combat is slow, but weighty; everything about the fighting is spot on. Small weapons swing fast like they should. Large weapons swing slow, and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying ""clunk"" sounds. Every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina. It's a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player. You can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can, but you won't be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina. All of this goes double for the intense boss fights - most of the bosses won't hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything you've learned thus far. You will die, a lot, but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment, because YOU DID IT ALL WITH YOUR OWN SKILL!The world of Dark Souls is completely open. There are very few loading screens, there are no transitional airlocks between areas; everything is seamlessly connected to each other. At times, the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places, suddenly everything feels natural. Dark Souls' atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention. At times you'll be exploring dark, moody caverns, other times you'll be wading through a dense, moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you. Sometimes you'll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress. Make sure you always have your wits about you and you're actively paying attention. The world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive, and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that ""adventure"" experience I've come to miss so bad. The world is yours, and you're free to go wherever you please. At times, you might feel like you're a bit lost, and I do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction, but there are subtle clues and hints. Are the enemies too hard in a certain area? Is there a locked door? There's probably another way you haven't explored yet.The world is also home to many NPCs. I mentioned before that if you don't take the time to talk to the NPCs you meet and try to piece together who they are, what they're doing, and how they got where they are, you're going to miss out of a lot of Dark Souls' story. This is where I feel Dark Souls' thematic focus comes full strength. The entire game is about overcoming, and fighting through your own struggles. In that same sense, all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something. Something they thought was important, or something they hold dear. Really, take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well. You won't know where they go next if you don't listen! With that said, if you make the effort to witness each of these stories, you'll watch them struggle along with you, fighting their own battles. Yes, Dark Souls is rich with lore and backstory, but I think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in, while you yourself are fighting your own battles too.Dark Souls also has a very unusual multiplayer system. At all times, your character will be in either one of two forms: hollowed, or human. You spend a somewhat uncommon item called ""Humanity"" to turn from hollow to human. This enables you to partake in jolly co-operation! If you're in an area where you haven't beaten the boss yet, you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area, as long as they're relatively near your soul level. Sounds good right? Just like the combat, there's another consequence you might have to face when you turn human. Dark Souls allows players to ""invade"" the worlds of other human players. They will appear as red phantoms, and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight, essentially marking this game's version of PvP.Now, this is where I feel Dark Souls' biggest community strength comes from. You see, once a player invades you, all bets are off. They might be insanely twinked out. They might be a fair fight. They might want to honor duel you. You might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out. Some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of ""honor"" code when it comes to PvP. They like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling, with no help from other players or no healing, stuff like that. Some players agree with doing this. Some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places, not knowing what either party will be up against. Some players are firmly rooted in the idea that PvE and PvP should not intertwine. They'll even go as far as to never turn human. What ""honor"" or ""etiquette"" should be included in Dark Souls' PvP, if any, is still being debated today. I feel like there will never be one solid answer but I think that's okay. It allows for more discussion and I think there's something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an in-game mechanic should work. Bottom line: try, at least a couple times, to play through the game in human form. The invasion mechanic is a part of the game, and even though sometimes you'll get ganked, it's an experience quite like no other.Dark Souls is challenging, but not unfair. To be honest, the difficulty this game is notorious for isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of obstacles you'll have to overcome and at times it'll feel like you're stuck. But don't give up. Never give up.In today's world of modern game development, it's very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think, perceive, and act. Dark Souls is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design, and it stands as one of my all time favorite games. Highly recommended. Well, now you know... and I can die with hope in my heart.			"

												I've had a love-hate relationship with this game for years. My first three attempts were miserable failures, and hardly stretched beyond an hour of gameplay. It took a fourth attempt to understand where I went wrong.This game is not a bully or a menace. It is not unfair. Dark Souls is a father that wants to play catch with you in the backyard. Sure, he tosses you a few practice pitches, gets you warmed up, makes you feel like you're in the big leagues. Suddenly, you eat a screwball to the temple. You cry at first, moan, maybe fuss a little, and then get up to catch another. The stinging welt on your face reminds you to keep your glove up. Throughout this process, your father slams a fastball into your gut, sails a slider into your genitals, cracks your skull with a curveball, and he'll throw a second ball just when you're barely figuring out the first. Now you can give up whenever you want. Make a big deal about it, about how Dad is cheating or he's being mean or that it's all just a big waste of time. Your father will patiently wait while you throw your tantrum, slowly turning over the next hidden threat in his worn glove. The truth of the matter is that he wants you to succeed. He's teaching you by showing, not by telling. He's preparing you for something much, much worse that lurks ahead. Don't fight it. He wants you to succeed, but he's going to make you work for it. Take your lumps, say goodbye to your precious souls, and above all else: Prepare to die.			"

												Dark Souls is hard. That's the first thing people probably hear when the title is mentioned. I think that people have become spoiled -- or maybe weak or complacent are better words to use. We've become used to pressing A for awesome or quick time events flashing across the screen. We're used to hand holding and tutorials that overstay their welcome. We're used to winning and not having to work for it because challenges are usually designed to be beaten without the threat of losing or death. If Dark Souls is a difficult game, then it's because it actually respects the player. I know that I find the typical style of hand holding in games to be patronizing, no doubt from being developed for the lowest common denominator. If you die (and you will), then it's because you lack necessary information and must learn it through experience, or it's because you're not paying attention or being too careless. Dark Souls rewards adaptability and experience. If Dark Souls is difficult, then it's not because it is unfair, but because we are weak and need to shape up.Another claim I've seen bandied about is that Dark Souls is light on story, but I do not believe this to be true. The story, like the difficulty, treats the player with respect. We're not going to be fed exposition from an eye dropper. The majority of the lore we gather is embedded within item descriptions or world and enemy design. We approach the game as an explorer, travelling to the cataclysmic land of Lordran to sift through its relics and best its challenges. The way the lore is delivered reflects this. Does this mean that it is light on story? Only if we assume that deep story necessarily means being beaten over the head with it via heavy handed narratives. Dark Souls is/was a bad pc port. It is internally rendered at a fixed, low resolution, can't really be played without a controller and, the worst of all curses, uses Games for Windows Live. DSFix is a third party modification that alleviates the former graphical issues. There'll be a patch released this month to remove GFWL, so that takes care of another issue. Honestly, the game is such a masterpiece that it's worth recommending even with the above porting issues, but it's nice to know that the two main gripes (I don't mind using a controller, personally) are not issues any longer. Subtlety is an art that seems lost in the medium of video games. Games are treated as if they are amusement park rides with all the flash and noise one should expect from such a distraction. Dark Souls is not an amusement park ride, but more like a long forgotten, dusty tomb that we disturb at our own peril; it thusly responds to our disturbance in kind. I played Dark Souls to completion around six times with three characters when it was released on consoles. I didn't hesitate to purchase it again when it was ported to PC. I've since played through seven more times with another three characters. I suppose you could call me a fan of the series. I obviously recommend it.			"

												I'd recommend this game under one condition: Take the advice in the title, and prepare yourself.  Death is not failure, but it is common.First, a bit of background: Coming into this game, and having never touched either it or a controller before, I actively disliked a lot about it.  I hated the Vancian cast limits placed on the magic (still do, in fact; I'd prefer nerfed magic and a bloody mana bar).  I also expected to be able to play it immediately, but instead was advised to get DSFix (no, seriously, get it immediately) to ensure that it worked well the first time around.  I had to buy a  controller just to PLAY the game, since the M&K combo didn't work out.  The only reason I even got the game was that a friend wanted me to try it, and it wasn't all that expensive.  All in all, I was more than ready to hate this game and everything about it.And then I actually PLAYED the game.And it's amazing.Let's ignore the setting for a minute, because it's awesome on its own.  Let's ignore the depth of the lore, and the subtlety behind it, for the same reasons.  Let's look at the combat, and the exploration, and the GAMEPLAY of the game.   I have never seen a game so dedicated to making it YOUR FAULT when you die.  It's not that hard to take about ten extra seconds and think it out before charging in, and if you do that, you instantly double your chances of survival.  Trying out a weapon and learning its quirks BEFORE fighting the enemy is absolutely vital, so that you know how to time your hits.  The attacks the enemies use are, for the most part, very easy to read if you just WAIT a minute and figure it out.  It's not hard to figure out which enemies are tough enough that you should just leave them alone for a while, and if you attacked them, it's on your head.  Once you understand the basic mechanics, the game becomes downright refreshing.I don't know about you, but I hate it when I die in a game and it WASN'T my fault.  I need to be able to see where I screwed up, and fix it.  This is the game that lets you do that, and if you're not willing to do so, of COURSE the game is super hard.  Of COURSE you're getting punished.  If you're not willing to learn and get good, you deserve punishment.In summary, though, this game is not for casuls.  This game is for the player who is willing to accept constructive criticism both from the game and from the player base.  This game is a trial by (bon)fire, and passing through will temper you into a better gamer, and possibly a better person.  Git gud, stay warm, praise the sun, and kill the dogs first.  Good luck out there, and don't you dare go Hollow.			"

												I was always afraid to play dark souls. I've heard the horror stories, I've heard of people spending hours on a boss, I've heard of people raging and almost quiting the game. And I went through all of that. And I'm glad I did, because I experienced one of the best games I've ever played. And dispite looking at guides and getting help, I'm proud that I was able to beat the game.I could go on about what the game is and what it does, but lets be honest, everyone whose played games before has heard of this game. I'm basically writing this for the people who where in my shoes before I played it. If your worried about the difficulty, about getting upset at the game, you will. Its almost a guarentee. You will have to look up guides to figure out what you're supposed to do next, but the games level design and combat more than make up for the frustrations of the game. And after you realize that death in this game isn't a punishment, but more of a learning experience, you stop getting so frustrating and you realize that you have to learn how the world works. There are definitely some frustrating elements that I think are way too unfair, but the game makes up for it with the combat and level design.I think everyone should play this game through at least the first 3 bosses. If you decide it isn't for you after that, that is prefectly fine. But a lot of people play for an hour, die, and say it was too frustrated. And admittedly I did that for a long time. But if you give this game a fair chance, I think you'll realize that it really isn't as frustrating and hard as people think.Dark Souls turned me from thinking it was a frustrating mess of a game to being one of the best games I've ever played, and I'll definitely play it again at some point. You owe it to yourself to give a fair shot to one of the best games of last generation. Buy At Full Price  "

												It's like being married to a woman who is attractive and charming and funny and intelligent and you are soulmates and everything is perfect, right? She is the perfect woman. You could not ask for a more better woman in the world. You love her, and she loves you. Only, she has one flaw. Every 5 minutes, she punches you in the face... For no reason, she just punches you in the face every 5 minutes. Even at night, you wake up, she punches you in the face. You recover, get 3 minutes 38 seconds of sleep, then she punches you in the face again. And you love her.Source: http://www.twitch.tv/theurbanorb/c/1581619

												By far the best game I have ever played. Dark Souls is NOT even close to the hardest games out there, contrary to popular belief. It is just a wake up call from the standard industry games where everything is handed to you. You actually improve at the game as you go, as opposed to just getting equipped with better gear only. This is a perfect 10/10 for me. Also don't use the drake sword.			"

												In this review I'll try to be concise but deepening the major aspects of the game. (°ロ°)☝♦ The difficulty♦ The graphics♦ The gameplay♦ The lore♦ The difficultyFirst of all, and probably the reason why this game is so famous (or infamous), is the difficulty.This game ain't that hard, it punishes every single mistake the player makes, often with death.I often read people complaining that this game is so hard only becase it's artificially made so with bad programming or ultraoverpowered enemies. It's not true. This game forces to learn (sometimes killing you 5 billion times in a row) the mechanics, but once you have learnt them, you can ""easily"" kill almost every single boss (made exception for 3 or 4 in which one you will just need patience or luck).I said that this game punishes mistakes. But not only the player's ones, even the one made by the AI: there is always a easier way to kill stuff than running onto them (because 90% of the time it will end with you respawning at the last bonfire).It's a challenge. No more words needed.♦ The graphicsThe graphic comparment of this game is simply beautiful.Maybe is not that pumped, but it's so cured that literally gives the feeling of running in a world made of chaos and beauty.The textures are a bit gross and at a closer look, ugly.But the way they are implemented in the world, with every collapsed building, grass growing in the wild or every strange liquid in the deepest areas of the world, the textures are just perfect.The light is not that well done but when it's dark, for God's sake, it's really dark. Not dark like ""meh, i can barely see stuff"", dark like ""Where the hell am I going? Where the hell is the road? Am I still alive? Was that a damned arrow?"".♦ The GameplayThis game is definetely not indicated for people who like the classic RPG game with quests, NPCs and maps.It gives only two directed suggestions:-""In Lordran, level up and kindle at bonfires"" -""Ring two bells and GTFO""STOP. No more instructions. no one will tell you where to go or what the hell is happening. You're alone in this dark and shattered world. People will trick you, people will invade you from their world, people will ♥♥♥♥ your game up killing NPCs. The only way to know where you have to lead next, is reading everything. On every item there is a description that tells you everything you need: where to go, where to look and what are the weaknesses of the bosses.Every single weapon has a unique moveset that goes well against certain enemies but against others are better other weapons. And i'm not saying that every weapon class has a moveset. Every. Single. Weapon.Don't ever try to do a 3v1 in an area (unless you're overleved), you will probably get rekt, or finish without estus (potions).This game is divided in areas, at the end whereof there is a boss fight. Until the final boss is killed, people can invade your world trying to kill you for souls and humanities. In the other hand, until the area is freed, you can convoke players.Last but not Least, when you die a blood stain will appear on the floor, cointaing the souls and the humanity you had.You can pick them up restoring everything you had. But if you die again trying, sayonara souls.USE A CONTROLLER.♦ The loreSome people complains that this game has no lore. This happens because just like what you have to do, no one says what the hell is going on. But items, ambientations, enemies, will scream out loud what happened and what is going on.Quoting the director of the game: ""A well designed world could tell its story in silence.""Watch THIS video. NOW.Like a moth, fluttering towards a flame10/10 "

												Dark Souls isn’t an especially hard game, it’s just a lot harder than most mainstream games today. I like to say it’s an early 90’s action RPG with modern 3D graphics and controls, in every aspect.The central thing that sets Dark Souls apart (as well as Demon’s Souls before it) is that it actually tries to respect the player’s intelligence and resilience by avoiding many of the practices today’s mainstream games adopt. It doesn’t hold your hand. It doesn’t constantly prod you in the right direction. It doesn’t spoon-feed you the storyline. It won’t try to make sure you constantly know where to go and what to do. The developers at From Software aren’t even worried about you possibly overlooking content in this game. Dark Souls provides you only with what you need to eventually figure out what to do.In terms of overall difficulty and its approach to the player I personally would say Dark Souls is about in line with most Super NES games. It actually feels like it takes a philosophy similar to that of the classic Mega Man and Mega Man X games. While playing you have to accept the fact that you’re going to die and retry a few times before you work out a strategy for beating a particular boss or getting past a certain situation. Most developers today are too worried players will get frustrated during that process and drop the game, but From Software doesn’t care.Dark Souls is definitely a punitive game. When you die you lose “souls,” a resource representing both your experience points and currency, which you get one chance to retrieve. Checkpoints are specifically placed throughout the game. Though you can save and quit literally anywhere, the game auto-saves after pretty much any action, so every single decision you make, big or small, is final. Many people have called Dark Souls the ultimate example of “tough but fair,” in video games.Even the tutorial manages to be at once smooth, enticing, and a bit challenging. The first time I tried Demon’s Souls it took me literally around 30 seconds to figure out the core combat controls (which are basically the same in Dark Souls). It’s a very intuitive system based on the left and right bumpers each representing a hand, (on an Xbox 360 pad) the B button representing dodge, and the management of a stamina meter. The rest the tutorial conveys with messages on the ground, immediately teaching you to read messages left by other players in the game proper. The tutorial section is basically a miniature version of a normal level of the game that doesn’t ever stop you to talk your ear off.Dark Souls even manages to stand out among action RPGs by nailing a unique balance between RPG stat-building and action game skill. It’s not a twitch game at all -- its action combat is rather slower than most games, requiring good timing, patience, and attention to enemy patterns (a lot like old school game but in 3D). As an RPG Dark Souls is about watching equipment stats (your gear is arguably more important than your level in this game), resistances, and a few other base stats, but attaining a high level does not at all negate the need for the aforementioned action game skills. In fact, with the right gear and enormous attention to enemy behavior, it’s possible to beat Dark Souls with a level 1 character.Another part of Dark Souls that feels tough but fair in a somewhat old school way is its level design. It takes many hours to realize it, but Dark Souls is basically a 3D Metroidvania. Its world is just as vertical as it is horizontal, each area containing shortcuts to other areas that show off real ingenuity in the level design. Oftentimes a “checkpoint” in a level is really just the activation of a shortcut you didn’t even know was there.One of my favorite things about Dark Souls though -- what it manages to do that too many games have forgotten, is carry a dark sense of mystery. Its environments make me feel cautious but simultaneously provoke my curiosity. It’s a feeling very akin to dungeon crawlers like Ultima Underworld. From Software manages to accomplish this with a combination of minimalist atmosphere and storytelling along with a pure yet baroque sense of art direction.Dark Souls pretty much constantly surprises you with what you find in each new environment whether that be unique enemies or the environment itself, never really giving you much of any clues as to what you’ll encounter next -- only just enough warning for ever-vigilant players. At the same time paying attention to environments, item descriptions, and NPCs starts to reveal what’s going on in the story as well as some of the game’s lore. Things like this are pretty much the game’s only storytelling devices.Those environments show Dark Souls is a strong case for art over tech in video game graphics. The game runs on a very modest engine that in many ways resembles PS2-era games, but is saved by superb art design in the environments and enemies. It’s all medieval fantasy, but it manages to nail a medieval look and a fantasy look that are more pure than most fantasy. Dark Souls obviously doesn’t pull its looks from other RPGs, but rather straight from actual medieval architecture, clothing, armor design, and fables.Dark Souls isn’t a terribly difficult game to run but unfortunately does require some modding on account the PC port’s rushed development cycle. Unless Durante’s DSfix is applied, the game is locked to 720p and 30 frames per second, and its keyboard controls are absolutely not recommended. Furthermore, your performance is highly dependent on your CPU’s base clock speed. If it’s under 3.0GHz you’re going to have trouble regardless of how many cores or threads you’re running.Dark Souls and its predecessor have gained an intimidating reputation, but if you’re tired of AAA games treating you like an idiot and you want a game that actually let’s you figure out how to play it on your own for a real sense of accomplishment, Dark Souls is just about the best you can do without going down to indie production values.

												Dark Souls is an incredible experience that challenges you in many ways. It can be difficult, but outside of one mid-game boss fight, it never seems ridiculous. Dungeons are extremely well-designed. I have played a lot of RPGs in my life, and this seriously has some of the most interesting, huge, incredible set of crafted dungeons I've ever seen. In addition to this, the game is beautiful, and the boss battles are intense and memorable.For the uninitiated, Dark Souls is a combat-oriented RPG. The world is beautifully designed and rendered. The aesthetic of the game ranges from gorgeous, breath-taking vistas to eerie, haunted locales. The sparse NPCs are laconic, have their own agendas, and come and go despite your desires. There are no random, unimportant NPCs in this game. The world of Dark Souls is dangerous, mysterious, and lost. The game designers leave a lot of details unspoken and allow your imagination to fill in the gaps.That said, this game can be very frustrating. I die a lot. I have fallen off cliffs. I have lost encounters with monsters much stronger than my character. I have been killed by other players repeatedly. I have been poisoned. I have been ambushed.So is it fun? Yeah, I think so. There is something exciting about exploring your way through a booby-trapped fortress that would give Indiana Jones a run for his money. It is rewarding to fight a near invulnerable opponent until you find his weakness, beat him to a pulp, and walk away with his magic ring. It's exciting to truly be worried about what is around the next corner when you've come way too far to go back, but don't want to dare fate and push ahead. It's exciting to sneak through the dark hoping you hear the monsters before the monsters hear you. This game has lifted my spirits and brutally dashed my hopes.I recommend this game to ANYONE, but especially those who like to become fully immersed in their gaming experience. This isn't just a game where you go from start to finish in a linear fashion; this is a universe of its own, with vast landscapes and beautifully crafted worlds and characters and weapons and spells and dialogue and narrative. You could play through this game a thousand times and never have the same experience. Things are constantly evolving, and with such multi-faceted quest-lines, the number of different character builds and tools available to each player, the replay value is HUGE.I really recommend that you visit the Wiki and follow a walkthrough so that you can get the most out of each level; it'll make things a lot less frustrating also. I mean, you'll still die regardless, walkthrough or no walkthrough, and you'll die a lot, but at least you'll know what to expect (kinda).			"

												I was a bit afraid of trying this game because of its reputation of being difficult. After 200+ hours of playing, I think that yes, it's challenging and it will test your patience (first time in Sen's funhouse Fortress) but it's not as difficult as some people make it seem.What I liked:- Melee combat - I usually prefer playing ranged but the melee combat in this game is so fun.- Gameplay - The pace of the game play is on the slower side, and involves a lot of trial and error.  You'll die quickly if you try to play it hack-and-slash style.  The more you die, the more you learn.- Level design - Interconnected areas, hidden areas, shortcuts.  Sen's funhouse :p- Loading screens - Only a few loading screens (when loading your save, when you die and respawn, and when using fast travel).- Skippable cutscenes - Most cutscenes are skippable.- Visuals - It doesn't have the best graphics but some areas look beautiful.- Weapons - There are a lot of weapons in this game, with different movesets for each kind of weapon.- Armor design - This is usually my pet peeve in RPGs. I was surprised that a Japanese game had practical-looking armors, and none of the chainmail bikini or boobplate nonsense in many RPGs.  There are ridiculous-looking armors too but they look ridiculous regardless of the sex of the character wearing them.- Jolly cooperation :DMeh:- The trek from bonfire (spawn point) to boss area felt tedious after dying from the same boss numerous times.- No pause (probably because of multiplayer). Not really a problem outside boss fights because you can just quit the game then load your save afterwards.  During boss fights, if you have to take care of something for a short while, you can't pause so you'll have to repeat from the start.- Lag during invasions (fixed by Alt+F4 :p )Other stuff:- Using a controller is highly recommended- Use DSfix to fix the resolution, remove 30 fps lock, use texture mods, etc.- If you've seen ""Edge of Tomorrow"", that's basically how Dark Souls plays like.

Do not go near skeletons, they don't want to be your friends, not do they want to stay down long.The merchant can be killed for a nice sword. unlike the rest of the dead in undeadburg he doesn't respawn, nor does his item stock, leaving you temporarily up♥♥♥♥♥♥creak without anywhere to buy a paddle when, you badly need said paddle.Never play chicken with a taurus demon. They always win.Dragons do not fight fairRats are truly pests.After the first bell. Everything you thought was hard was just a warm-up. Get used to poison and toxins.This game is so fecking hard.

												Short version :One of the best RPG games EVER made, that's coming from a gamer who's played over a hundred RPG titles in his life. Dark Souls - 9.5/10[I myself put in around 400+ hours on my PS3 version until people stopped playing Dark Souls on the PS3, that's when I bought the PC version and the rest is history.]Long Version :Darks Souls..... so much to say about the title. It's not your average day game, that's for sure.The game throws the player in a very difficult world, not just by gameplay standards, but plotwise as well. The narrative is played in such a way that it's never speaking to the player, but rather to your character, it never breaks the 4th wall by directly telling the player what to do and how to do it, only the basic attack move buttons are given to you at the begining, and from then on, you're completely on your own for the rest of the 50+ hour journey. Unless you get a co-op partner or go through some guides on the internet.Dark Souls boasts a great online system that originates from it's spiritual predecessor Demon Souls, one that was revolutionary when it came out. You can invade other people's world, like literally, their own game world, just like they can invade yours, but invasion can only happen on certain circumstances. You can also allow other people to summon you to their world, so you can help them fight tough bosses, or protect them from other players who invaded their world. Dark Souls has covenants, which are ingame clans. Different covenants has different attributes, you can level up your covenant level to get bonuses, abandoning covenants has penalties and make you regret it. Dark Souls' online system is great, but it's connectivity issues are still poor as of today, but it works usually and can give you jolly good fun!The story of the game won't be told to you directly, you won't get cutscenes where NPC's tell you stuff and action scenes occur.... no, that's now how it is. You'll learn the story through character dialogues, item informations, the appearence of an area and boss battles. Yes, boss battles gives you a great deal of story, you learn why their fighting you, aside from demons, no enemy in the game is actually a villian, they're fighting you for their own reasons.Dark Souls in my opinion is technically one of the best games ever made in terms of gameplay. A lot of people say that the gameplay is broken, but if you play it for some time, you'll understand how beautifully crafted it really is. You can perform so many movesets, no other game that I've played has such a thing. To kick, to jump attack, to jump, to parry, backjump, to roll, to attack with your right or left hand, to heavy attack with your right or left hand, to block, to equip your weapon with both hands which changes your attacks and increases damage, to backstab, to use bows, crossbows, magics, apply magical effect on your weapon and many more. So many elements, it's literally the perfect gameplay for me, it feels so real, and so technical. When you defeat a tough enemy or a boss, you feel like the best dude there ever lived, like you've achieved human perfection. That's how satisfying the gameplay really is.It's simply magnificent, totally worth buying, truly worth playing.			"

												- Personal Rating - ""Must own Instant Classic""- Traditional Rating - ""9.5/10""This game... currently sits at my absolute favourite experience this generation and Video Games in general. Dark Souls, storywise is what's considered a minimalistic game in terms of it being a ""Find it Yourself"" and the experience itself hails back to classic games of old in it's design, it drops you in a huge expansive world, where you, as the ""Chosen Undead"" are tasked to braving the world of Lordran to either save or destroy an age.I personally think this is one of the greatest experiences found in any video game ever, and is one that's mostly all about self satisfaction than rewards. The game starts you out at an Asylum as you escape from it, the game immediately drops in a huge boss enemy that you must run away from (at the time being) as the game teaches you how to be cautious and watch out for traps ahead, enemies and ambushes as well as eventually give you the weapons of the class you chose at the Character Creator. What you do with this information here will carry out through the ENTIRE game. As soon as you defeat the Boss and escape the Asylum, your are thrown at a completely new area with no set path to go, you're given a goal - Ring two bells, and that's it, it's up to you to find out why and what for.The game is based around traps and enemy types that will undoubtedly down you the first time around until you figure out their patterns and weaknesses (this also holds true to bosses). There are a multitude of different enemy types around the game that will test your mettle as every enemy encounter feels more like a duel than actual fodder as you are learning them. After you kill an enemy, you collect their ""Souls"" (that save as the game's style of currency) that is used to not only level up, but to buy items, weapons, etc as well - enemies may also drop weapons or armor depending on who they are and how rare the drop may be. The world is also pretty expansive with areas that are highly varied that each tell their own stories and further re-inforces the ""Figure it yourself"" type of story; pretty much every area and detail is important to the story and what is actually going on, from villages, to rotting bridges, to an area mostly populated by dragons, to a fortress filled with death traps to the brim - there's no shortage of level design to be found here, and everything is fully explorable and is encourageable to do so, as you can find the rarer armour or weapons this way - as you make your way to the nearest bonfires (checkpoint system for the game).The leveling system itself is a bit cryptic if anything. What the game won't tell you is that after a certain number is reached per stat (50 generally) those stats stop scaling in very meaningful ways. These stats are essential to building a certain character, similar to an MMO. By leveling up a stat like, Intelligence for example, you'll be building up a Mage, like building up a stat like Strength or Dexterity will most likely build a melee style character. There's no limit to a character you can build which is what kept the community for the game going to this day.As far as the Online Multiplayer goes - this game has one of the most inventive systems in place. If your character is undead, you cannot summon other people (or NPC Phantoms) to help you out in combat and you cannot be invaded. Invasion is, in my opinion, what makes a game like Dark Souls the game it is. Invasion is when another player (and in some cases an NPC) comes into your world sporting a dark red aura (in certain other cases a Dark Blue aura) and attempt to kill you, as well as you can invade another player's world and attempt to kill them to steal their humanity. Humanity is also a key feature for the online portion of the game and the game in general. Humanity is used to revive your character at a bonfire, while ""Human"" is when you can be invaded or invade others, and summon other players or NPCs.There's a bunch more details to this game I could go on and on about, but if you're reading this, you're most likely either looking to continue supporting Dark Souls or buy it. If you haven't bought this game, and you enjoy tough games that reward perseverance, get this game. It sits as my absolute favourite video game this generation for a multitude of reasons, it's a game that harkens back to days of old and it refuses to hold your hand in any way throughout the whole adventure.A+++			"

												Dark Souls, perhaps more than any other game on the market, is preceded by a reputation. From its ultra-imposing, ultra-intimidating bosses, to the alienating community mantra of ""git gud"", to the game's own subtitle of ""Prepare To Die"", the message seems clear: this game is hard, and you're going to die. A lot. The reality is, thankfully, quite a bit more complex than that. While Dark Souls seems destined to make an appearance on nearly every ""most difficult games"" list ever compiled, to place a disproportionate focus on some sort of perceived insatiable sadism is to sell the game far, far short of what it truly has on offer. Consider the whole picture, and it's little surprise that the Souls series has essentially spawned an entirely new subgenre unto its own.At its core, Dark Souls is a game that demands to be respected. Every step you take, every swing of your sword, every swig of life-giving Estus is subject to an assessment of risk. New players quickly learn that while sharp reflexes don't hurt, it's caution, calculation, and preparation that make the difference between ""VICTORY ACHIEVED"" and the infamous ""YOU DIED"". Button-mashing and face-rolling will only see you sent back to the last bonfire, but with a bit of patience and a cool head you'll realize that towering demons and seven-headed serpents aren't quite so scary after all.For as much respect as this game requires of the player, it returns it in kind. Save for a select portion or two of the game where it seems to momentarily forget that it's not actually part of the Uncharted series, fights are fair and frustration is shockingly minimal. While I won't go so far as to suggest that ""no death is ever the game's fault"", I will say that this game emanates a general ethos of measured punishment. Believe it or not, Dark Souls honestly does want you to succeed. It goes to great lengths to ensure that with enough observation, adaptation, and perseverance you will always have at your disposal every tool necessary to do so, even when your situation initially looks hopeless.In addition to its punishing-yet-rewarding gameplay, there really is a lot to love about Dark Souls. For a game of few conversations and fewer cutscenes, its lore is surprisingly deep. While some exposition does exist as a more direct means of world-building, much of it must be pieced together through a combination of lore-bearing items and reasonable inferences made about the world around you. Much of the game follows a similar philosophy of content delivery, where there is always something new for particularly-astute players to discover. To this point, the game is perfectly content to allow even entire portions of the game world to be passed right by if a player doesn't happen to stumble upon them by chance (or by wiki).Level design (for as much as ""levels"" exist at all in this game) is another area in which Dark Souls stands head-and-shoulders above the competition. Whereas many games seem to be satisfied with horizontal expanses of isolated chunks of content, Dark Souls has crafted an intricately-interconnected and startlingly-vertical world. During the course of my own playthrough, it was not uncommon for me to be suddenly taken aback at the realization that the passage I had just discovered had opened up an alternative route back to a previously-visited location, often in a surprising and pleasantly unexpected way.Enemy design is varied and interesting. Few games have so effectively inspired within me such a mixture of wonder, awe, and intimidation as this game has with its enemies, especially with its area bosses. Combine this with the fact that each boss has its own dedicated (and often hauntingly-beautiful) audio track playing in the background as you take them on, and boss fights tend to be as mesmerizing as they are terrifying.The way that Dark Souls implements its multiplayer is particularly interesting. Rather than a discrete mode of play, multiplayer is integrated directly into the core game. Players broadcast messages to the greater community by placing them into the environment, like graffiti on a wall. Through certain actions, with the aid of specific items, a player may even find themselves directly crossing paths with other players themselves (for better, or for worse), without even leaving their own play session. As far as I'm aware, all of this is (or at least was at one point) completely unique to Dark Souls.Now, because I feel as though I've done nothing but gush about this game since my fingers hit the keyboard, I must note that there are, of course, flaws. As I mentioned, there are a few encounters in this game that feel rushed and cheap, and some that feel as though they would be more at home in a ""high-octane"" action-adventure game. A number of enemies are obvious near-carbon copies of one another with differing coats of paint. Some latter segments of the game suffer from level design that just doesn't stand up to what you've come to expect of it by those points. While the game's systems are generally refreshingly hands-off with regards to mechanical indoctrination, they can at times feel unnecessarily opaque, to the point where you'll be tempted to keep your web browser open to the Dark Souls wiki in the background while you play.Finally, because no Dark Souls PC review would be complete without this mention, some light third-party modding is borderline-necessary here. The ubiquitous DSFix is such for a reason, as the game constitutes a pretty lackluster PC port. Frame rate improvements, a wider array of video resolutions, and a number of other graphical and performance-related options are likely to add immensely to one's enjoyment of this fantastic game.What else can I say about this game? What else has already been said a thousand times over? If this game sounds at all intriguing to you, especially if you're somebody who has shied away due to its menacing persona, I'd urge you to try it anyway. With a bit of ""can do"" attitude, you may surprise yourself at your ability to push through a steep learning curve to uncover an experience that makes you feel rewarded in ways that most other games seem almost afraid to do. Play this game, and you may find that most other games just don't quite do it for you anymore.If you've found yourself on-the-fence about purchasing, give Dark Souls a fair shot - believe it or not, it'll do the same for you.To anybody who enjoyed this review, consider checking out the following commentary video by Matthewmatosis. It's six-and-a-half hours long, but I found it quite informative and insightful, and it inspired my own review pretty heavily. If you're a big Dark Souls fan like myself, you might find it time well-spent.

												Dark Souls is an action role playing game, developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games, releasing in 2011 on the console market, and 2012 on the PC.  This is the second game in the “Souls” series, the original game “Demon’s Souls” was never released on the PC format.  The series is set in a dark fantasy universe. Game play in Dark Souls is something which a lot of people will have seen from online memes and articles depicting it as an extremely hard game to play.  Whilst this is true, the game’s difficulty is also fair at the same time, with the game relying primarily on the player’s skill, rather than how they are geared and what level they are.  At the start of the game you get your character creation segment, you can go as in depth or as basic into this as you like – choosing options such as sex, appearance, name and class.  You play the game in a third person perspective, you have access to tons of different weapons, and each has their own unique style and even their own attack animation to add to the variety.  Weapons require a certain amount of skill points in certain areas, which can be improved by levelling up your character through collecting Souls; this is the game’s currency system as well as experience points.  The combat system in Dark Souls is one of the game’s most positive features, with system that is easy to grasp, but pretty hard to become a master of. With a lot of enemies having different attack routines, you are never quite sure how you should react, should you dodge this attack? Should I parry this attack? Am I just outright dead? Dark Souls has a huge learning curve and as you may probably already know, you will die….a lot. Graphically, Dark Souls upon released looked like your typical PS3 release. By today’s standards it would be considered very dated.  Thankfully with the game being on PC, we have options to a plethora of mods which increase the visual appearance of the game ten-fold. If you aren’t a fan of modding games, then the graphical side of Dark Souls may be something which puts you off a little, with low quality textures, and an even worse resolution cap in place.  With mods not only can you make the game look beautiful, but you can crank the resolution up as high as you want, as well as increasing the frame rate to 60 fps.  Dark Souls has some really good sound tracks too, and whilst the game has voice acting of the majority of characters; something just doesn’t sound right about them. Whether that is the style the developers were going for to make it seem very eerie; I am not sure, but there is something very different about the voice acting in Dark Souls. The game is essentially an open world playground to adventure in. There are no loading screens, or “levels”. If you have the balls, you can actually go where ever you want from the very start of the game, that’s one of the games really difficult parts – making the player work out for themselves on where they need to go in the right order. Throughout the world you will encounter tons of different enemies, equipment vendors, and loot. The game feels very vast in the amount of content there is to see with plenty of paths to take you off your main route. As you can see from my play time on Dark Souls, 73 hours is a lot. In fact that is probably about 1 and a half play throughs of the game. Your first play through Souls will probably take you about 30+ hours, depending on how you are with the combat system. Beating this game is no easy feat, and when you finish it, you will have a real sense of achievement because not many people have done so.  Achievement hunters amongst us will also have a huge task on hand, with an estimated 130 hours needed to complete this game fully. There is also a large amount of replay ability factored into Dark Souls.  You can simply start the game again with a different class and have a whole new experience, as the tactics you used to beat bosses last time will no longer be viable depending on your class. Technically, on PC Dark Souls released in a poor state; thankfully with the help of mods all of these issues were able to be fixed. First of all, don’t even attempt to play this game with keyboard and mouse that will really take the difficulty level to all new heights. The most important mod you will need to make Dark Souls playable on PC is DSFix which can be downloaded here - http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/? – The mod is very easy to install and configure, and there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube that will help you get the absolute most out of this mod. Dark Souls is a real test of a gamer’s skill and patience. It is difficult, but fair at the same time. If you want to test yourself on one of the most difficult action games out there, Dark Souls will be for you. I had so much fun playing through this game and am thoroughly proud of myself for actually managing to beat it.  If you want the full experience of struggle, try the game without the use of wikis or guides! Dark Souls will not be for everyone, and that is fine, but I strongly urge anyone who even has a passing interest in the action RPG genre to attempt to beat this game.  The game’s regular retail price on Steam is £19, 99 – whilst this is still pretty high for a game that was released in 2012, you are getting a monster of a title.  Sale season has been known to bring Dark Souls down to less than £5 though.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Dark Souls has a reputation for difficulty. Git gud, they say. But it's not that Dark Souls is necessarily difficult, more that it has a steep learning curve. It can be intimidating for newcomers, as it was for me when I first played it. I got as far as Gaping Dragon and hit what I thought was a brick wall. So I shelved it for nearly two years.With the release of Dark Souls 3, I thought I needed to give the original another chance. Boy, am I glad that I did. This time I had encouragement, and some determination. Again I struggled at the beginning, ""f*ck this game!"" being uttered on more than one occasion. But then it suddenly clicked. I don't know what it was, perhaps I genuinely started to get better at the game, perhaps I upgraded my first weapon, but I know that by the time I encountered Gaping Dragon again, I knew - this time - that I would succeed. First attempt. Fist pump! That feeling when you beat something you'd considered a massive difficulty spike, there's nothing quite like it, and Dark Souls serves them up on a regular basis. It gives you such a sense of achievement, it's like a drug.But it's not all about combat. Dark Souls rewards exploration. Not just with trinkets, but with real, tangible benefits. Those ""holy crap, I can't believe I just found this awesome thing!"" kind of benefits. It's a remarkable game, the level design is inspired (ok, there are a couple of exceptions late in the game which seemed a little ""tacked on""), the enemy and particularly boss design is excellent, and it grabbed me so hard I could think of little else for the few weeks I was playing it.Absolutely grab dsfix, which improves the textures dramatically and improves the feel of the game unquestionably at 60 fps. It's easy to implement. And don't be afraid to ask people for help, it's almost a requirement, that sense of community encouragement in overcoming the challenges you face. Even now (May 2016) there's still plenty of multiplayer activity, people willing to help, messages to guide you, and the occasional invader to challenge you. It just feels right.Gush, gush, gush, yes I know, but I don't care because Dark Souls really is that good... once it grabs you.What? Oh. Yeah, ok. I should, shouldn't I? Ok, just because it's you, Dark Souls...Praise the Sun! \[T]/			"

												For the past year or two, gaming lost it's touch to me. I found myself starting up games, and getting bored within 10 minutes, even new games I just recently purchased, I thought the gaming phase of my life was over at 20 years old. But still, I continued that search for a game that would spark that feeling I had when I was 14. The feeling of deep immersion, losing myself within the game, wanting to find out more, and improve myself. Then, this game happpened.I heard about Dark Souls first about 1 year ago, mid 2015. Nothing about it seemed interesting to me, I heard it was incredibly hard, the story was confusing, and I felt like gaming was past me. So about 6 months pass, and I hear about the hype of Dark Souls 3, something about this series now seems intriguing, I still pass it off as something I'm not going to ever play though. Then it comes out, I see all these youtube videos about it, people going crazy about how amazing it is... alright I've got to at least try one of these games, where do I start?$60 for a game I don't even think I will like? No thanks. Alright lets see number two, $55 for a game I'm not sure about? No thanks, once again. Ah, lets check the first. After a few minutes of pondering, I decide f**k it, I'm buying it, and here starts my journey.I'm new, I don't know what the hell is going on, but this game, something about it, every time I die, I want to go further, figure out how to fix what I did wrong last. It's not Skyrim, it's not some boring repetive game, it's just... different, nothing like I've ever experienced. Then after a while, a few hours past, wait what? I'm actually... getting into a game again, I want to play more. I want to improve my character so I can kill that Black Knight and get whatever is behind him, I want to finally find a new cool piece of armour, I want to figure out what the f**k is actually happening in this world and where the story is going.This, is a f**king game done right. Just buy it, try it out, you wont regret it. Ignore all the♥♥♥♥♥♥about people saying it's insanely difficult scaring you away, that is exactly what makes this game fun. It's a breath of fresh air to me, I'm only 5 hours in, and can't wait to keep playing the rest of this series.			"

												Dark Souls is the great misunderstood game of this generation. There’s a wildly prevalent belief the game’s extremely hard. People presume the developers, From Software, sat down and looked at the history of videogames, cherry-picking specific titles to place in their drawer of inspiration, only to cause perspiration for others. Ghosts ‘n’ Goblins and Battletoads would likely be in there. In there so the devs can look at them and exceed those levels of difficulty and cruelty and position their game to be harder than, well, than anything you have ever played before. This just isn’t the case. It’s just misunderstood. You see, dieing hundreds and thousands of times as you make your way from the relative comfort of Firelink Shrine through Darkroot Garden and onto Blighttown is part of the game mechanics, part of the game design and the basis of the learning curve. You move a few feet, meet a foe and are vanquished in the fleeting moments between letting loose a flash of your heavy blade and the connection of their harder and faster attack with your torso. You try again, make your way back to the location of your vanquishing and collect the souls you had before that failure, this time with a little more awareness of what is about to befall you. You think to yourself a quick attack might be the better option, or maybe a long-range effort if so endowed. You’ve learned what not to do. Now you teach yourself what to do. It probably still isn’t enough. A third, fourth, thirtieth time and you eventually get past that particular villainous creature. Each time you died you were that little bit wiser, that little bit stronger. Regardless of it all the compulsion to continue was unbearable. There was no stopping, no waiting. Just the desperate need to keep on trying, learning and eventually succeeding. It was incredibly hard work and around the corner there’s more to do, different baddies to beat and extra secrets to uncover. You have no idea if you’re going in the right direction, the wrong direction or even in a direction you have no right going until tens of levels stronger. The compulsion is there though. It’s not a hard game, see, it’s just a game with a deep, long-lasting and incredibly compulsive mechanic with death part of the process, rather than the end as in the majority of titles today. Dark Souls is essentially a third-person Elder Scrolls game for the self-hating. Like Bethesda's masterful series, Dark Souls offers you a fantasy tale with dragons and other mythical creatures to meet, classes to choose from, factions to join, magical spells to learn, a huge world to explore, and a bunch of awesome medieval gear to find. But unlike the Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls doesn't reward your failures with generous helpings of EXP and leveled-up abilities, and its combat is nuanced and unforgiving. Dark Souls kills you over and over, and then punishes you for dying. If you want to make the game a little easier, grind to improve your character. If you don't like it, go play Skyrim with all the other wimps.At its core, Dark Souls is a game about animations. You need to keep a close eye on what your enemies are up to, and you need to remember that every button you press commits your character to a full motion. If you begin an attack animation after an enemy starts swinging at you, you'll probably get hit. If you want to take a swig from your health flask, you need to know that your character will take his sweet time, leaving himself vulnerable. And when you get knocked down, your character won't scramble back to his feet; he'll lie there for a second, just tempting bad guys to move in.You need to take each enemy type, dissect their patterns, and figure out what works through trial and error. It might be as simple as blocking, strafing, and attacking when you get the chance. Or, you might need to deflect their blows to stagger them, or somersault away to avoid a powerful blow your shield can't handle, or use a certain type of magic. You're prevented from button-mashing by your stamina meter, which is not particularly generous unless you pour a lot of effort into leveling it up. The upside: When you finally get a hard part right, you feel… well, not good so much, but relieved.Of course, there's more to an action-RPG than just the action. Killing enemies earns you souls, which you can spend (if you don't lose them first) to improve your many attributes—and RPG progression is the only way to make this game less difficult. You'll want to find and improve the best weapons and armor. You also earn a resource called ""humanity,"" which makes you a little less undead, allows you to return to your human form, and offers a variety of other perks, such as the ability to ""kindle"" a bonfire. (Bonfires are this game's checkpoints, and they refill your health flask; kindling the fire doubles the amount of health the bonfire gives you.)The visuals are well-crafted, for the most part. Dark Souls offers impressive environments, detailed and frightening enemies, and fluid animations. The creepy music and decent voice acting add to the atmosphere, too.As for the controls, they're easy to get used to, but you'll definitely want a controller. There is a default keyboard configuration, but it's incredibly clumsy, and the developers don't even pretend there's a chance you might use it—all the on-screen instructions pertain to the gamepad. (No, you don't ""Press A"" to pick up items when you're using a WASD movement setup.)There's ten hours of new content in the ""Prepare to Die Edition"" as well, making it the definitive version of Dark Souls There's a new chapter of the story, including fresh areas, bosses, enemies, and NPCs. As I said above, most players probably won't finish the game—which was up to 100 hours long to begin with—so it's not that big of a deal that this version has more of it. But if you're a hardcore Dark Souls fan, or if you're confident in your ability to wring every last cent of value out of the game, the Prepare to Die Edition is the way to go.A Must Play "

Dark souls...whew, I just finished, and I'm ready for a review now.I was one of those people who knew that Dark Souls was supposed to be a pretty hard game and that was it, until the DS3 hype came in. I tried a friends' DS3 and I loved it, however I felt that something was missing, I felt I was missing much of the rich ""Dark Souls"" culture. So I said thanks a lot for letting me play DS3, and bought the DS1. Best, idea, ever.GraphicallyFor some reason I did not expect much for all being ""old game"" & stuff of the like, however I was a quite surprised at how beautiful the environments looked, if you like looking around at the panoramas like I do, oh you're in for a treat. I loved the style. But then I wondered if it could get better anyway, well it can! With DSFix (mod) + HD textures mod it will make your retina soothe a lil bit while playing. Game mechanicsIf this game is thought to be pretty hard, it is because you have to actually ""git gud"" as they say. Getting used to the hitboxes, judge where should you roll to, understand how to choose your setup, analize the boss and see what is the best approach, etc. That takes time, in fact, that is pretty much the hard part. As you progress, you will find (or at least I did) that the TRUE empowering comes from all those tricks and tips in your Dark Souls journey, not so much from leveling up your character or your weapons. So what really makes you stronger is not the +15 weapon you'll be holding at some point, but knowledge (but the +15 weapon helps a bit anyway).Curiosity winsI thought this was quite interesting. Sometimes perhaps one is way too linear, making it so that you might be focusing on being able to handle gracefully your inevitable thousands of deaths, and overcome the impression of some scenarios, monsters, bosses, clinging to the last second as to safeguard your hard earned souls. However, this game WILL punish you for being linear, apart from being vigilant for your health, you need to be able to have a keen eye for secrets and items lying around. You have to be curious and say ""Oh, look, a freaking dark hallway! Probably there will be a thousand monsters but perhaps I find something!"" and so you may...The item descriptions, the tricky environment taking advantage of your camera angles, illusion magic, and what not. You need to make Dora the Explorer be freaking proud of you here, else you might lose tons and I mean TONS of items, upgrades, CONTENT! Not all the content is there for you to gobble at plain sight. Also, if you are getting your gluteus maximus handed over to you, you're probably not where you are supposed to be yet (according to your strength) however, you can technically access almost all the main areas from the start, if you discover how...This game comes from a console, is it good for PC?To be honest, the thought of using a mouse and a keyboard for this game was discarded after the first 60 seconds. If you plan on getting this game, I STRONGLY recommend to use a controller. There are some bosses/monsters there that I seriously doubt that you will have a nice time with M&K instead of a controller. So if you don't have one, you might want to have that in mind. Stress factorI believe this is a game far more enjoyable for those able to keep a serene focus on everything that needs attending. If your ragemeter fills up fairly quickly, this is not for you. If you are expecting greenlands and rainbows, this is not for you. If you tend to be rapidly stressed by demanding situations, this is not for you. You should not suffer over a game either for a hype or because your want the achievements, or who knows why, only enjoy. Those with a serene focus will be able to adapt better their responses to the always-changing situations that the game will place you in. LoreAs of today, you are probably used to quest markers everywhere, a minimap, perhaps a little dot trail for you to follow. Well, this game has none of that, you are thrown out of the blue, with a few character control indications and it is expected of you to figure everything else. Everything. This not only includes how the game works, but what the hell is actually going on. The background story is not spoon-fed to you as you go here and there, you have to fusion your archaeology and anthropology skills. Collecting here and there some items, reading descriptions, very very carefully listening to what the few NPCs might have to say about anything, oh yes, that is of outmost importance, if anyone (or anything) opens their mouth to say anything to you (which they won't except for one because they use like telepathy or something) pay special attention to every syllable.MultiplayerIs this game dead? No, to my surprise. I actually bought it with the hopes of having buddies from around the world to come and join me in my treks. Well, actually this was my first and perhaps my biggest negative experience, you will find that some people just simply want to see the world burn and will on purpose try to wreck your experience, so you have to be smart. Not just with a message saying ""Jump here"" where you'll fall to your death, no, that is actually part of the fun of the game, I don't enjoy tricking people, but sometimes it make me chuckle when I saw the blood spots near one of those or saying ""Oh hell no I'm not dumb man!"" after reading it, etc. No what I mean, is people using cheats or the ""namebug"" just to get your game to crash, I was so excited when I saw the first summon sign ever, and when I activated it, my game crashed, and I was terrified it might have corrupted my save or something. Which is why I recommend to setup the watchdogs and the DSCM mods, which will boost up positively your multiplayer experience. Be wary of those invaders *chuckle*! I dislike PvP, so I can't really say I had much success at invading as to provide you with accurate experience on how balanced the matches were, etc. (must git moar gud). However along your way you'll find not a few phantoms ready to help you (humans or NPCs alike).   My experienceThis game was absolutely overwhelming for me. I fell in love. The level design (expect for Blighttown, god I hated that, and you will too, you will too...), the music, the bosses, the armor designs, the not-so-obvious storyline, the not-so-obvious mechanics, everything. This game has taught me what distrust is though, but I sort of liked that, made it fun, I would never open anything before hitting it (you will find out why), randomly hitting walls (you will find out why), watch my back from times to times, etc. And while this world is certainly an unforgiving, blackned, eerie, devastated, hell, there are times when it will make you smile and laugh. When I finally got to the last boss and managed to beat him in my, like, 7th try, I was shaking. It has been long since I deeply enjoyed such a masterpiece.Now I have to wait until DS3 is way more affordable, sometime in the future...Time to hop on to DS2 while that happens.If you plan on buying it, just remember: patience, curiosity, and serenity.Praise the sun! :D			"

												Once I was in Kansas City and stopped in at a restaurant called The Hereford House.  I ordered a steak.  It was 24 ounces and about 3 inches thick.  It was perfectly cooked...somehow not bloody and not over done.  It was perfectly marbled.  It was absolutely delicious.If video games were steaks, then Dark Souls would be the one I described above.Even after all the years and all the newer (not better) souls games, and all the immitators, there's nothing like the original Dark Souls.  It lets you choose different paths of advancement and each path is - maybe not equally powerful - but equally viable.  There are many ways to kill the bosses.  Any of them which result in a dead boss is the correct way.  And it is very satisfying to play one of the hardest games ever made and still find new and different ways to make it look easy.Its not going to be easy your first play through.  Don't care who you are or how many games you've played.  But after the 5th time you've done it all, you'll start to understand what mistakes to avoid.  And you still won't be bored fighting the same bosses you've fought at least 5 (and probably more like 20) times before.Pros:  It's really a unique game which pits you against tough bosses and even random trash mobs that can ruin your day if you aren't on your game.Cons: I can't really think of any except to say that the console port is a console port.  You really must use a controller.  Yeah, you can configure mouse and keyboard... but use a controller if you don't want to hate life and burn your own house down in frustration.Normally I review things in a more clinical way.  But it wouldn't do this game justice.  If you want to see if you've really got what it takes to play a game designed to be hard, play this game.  Other games use the 'look hard, play easy' design paradigm.  That's fine.  Not every game should make you want to cry in frustration as a 250 pound grown man.  But if you  have to know if you're good enough as a gamer - there's no where else you need to look than Dark Souls.One last thing - Prepare to Die has extra content. It's not really as good as the original.  It's good, don't get me wrong.  But the bosses drift more to the 'cheap' side rather than the genuinely hard side.  So if you need to save a few bucks, skip Prepare to Die and you'll still get the experience.			"

Dark Souls changed me, as a player and as a person. But changed me a lot more as a gamer. I want to review this masterpiece but I'm afraid mere words won't do it justice.Dark Souls is an RPG based on a world where humanity lost the right to a final rest, as they become undead when death is upon every and each player to adventure itself out of the Asylum.There are plenty of information about the lore and such around the web, but I still feel the need to say that each story has a side, and between legends and fables, it's up to the player to uncover the truth... But what truth can be found, if not within our selves? This is the perspective that I have, and I'ts remarkable that to each, their own. Each player must accomplish his own journey to his own path and conclusion. Dark Souls is an open game, not only in design, but in the path's of the lore, where there are plenty of clues and perspectives to guess upon.Even with such rich detail and character personality, it's very unique the way you'll enjoy them, therefore I must focus on something that everyone share as common belief; The amazing level design, worthy of genius appraisal.The areas, from Undead Burg - a city collapsed by despair and plague, to Darkroot Garden - a fearful and mysterious woods, to even the glorious Anor Londo - A beautiful large city covered by the incandescent sun. Among many other's where the design remains bound to a rule of commitment: All areas must be connected, and they generally are through a well placed shortcut.All levels look like a new challenge, but they end up making a certain sense where the player can only admire how well done they are. Such a logical and practical path makes advances in the game so much fun and entertaining.Each area is covered with a atmosphere that marks the player, and it marked me in ways I can't entirely describe... It's an overwhelming feeling acquired by the details of light, flora, and even sounds.As everything above wasn't enough, we have another well common appreciation; the gameplay.Dark Souls is in my opinion, the game with the best character movement of all times. I know it's pretty arrogant to claim this, but I never experienced anything so complete, so responsive, so detailed, so so good. Of course, there are issues at times, but this is a game after all, it's not a science. Dark Souls is an abstract game when comes to in-game beliefs and theories, but it's almost pure science when moving and fighting. The controls feel natural and extremely responsive.Attacking, blocking, parrying, casting magic, everything makes me feel so special... even more when enemies are down.Anyone that enjoys defeating Boss's will love Dark Souls, and those who don't will start to!The game being hard isn't a lie, it's tough, but I found it to be more obtuse when come to use specific items. I believe this is no issue, as old games use to be like this, especially a game made for consoles where players use a controller. It's not an issue to me like I stated.Using the correct set up and leveling up on the right attributes can make you extremely strong and break the game, but even so, I found this to be the real challenge.Enemies are vast and committed to making you suffer, but this brings me to another important thing that make Dark Souls one of the best games ever... The community. I never in my life experienced such a strong, loyal and helpful community, like the Dark Souls fans. It's impressive, how steam forums are filled with such kind users and ready to help everyone. This to me is fascinating, because I don't think Dark Souls can be hard anymore, not when there are members dedicated to help and assist others. Marvelous!To end, I must say Dark Souls really changed me, it made me earn resistance, patience and made me respect my foes, but mostly, my own problems and life struggles. I made friends which I still talk to, and overall I feel I earn so much from this game... I can't stress enough how Dark Souls really are one of my favorite games of all times.Thank you From Software,and thank you, everyone that helped me improve in this fantastic game, and teach me the ways of the sun!

On the way you'll make new friends, drink a lot of whiskey, risk liver failure and even celebrate obesity through the lost art of cosplay. Not suitable for children over the age of 18.			"

												It's no secret that Dark Souls has become an emblematic symbol of the whole separate genre — brutal, distressful dungeon crawler with tricky challenges, gloomy setting, and unusual narrative form. The blurred contours of the new gold standard in dark fantasy RPG began to take its shape starting with the King's Field series and its spiritual successor — Demon's Souls. But the final master image was formed precisely after releasing Dark Souls.Beware! All things in this game can kill you. Even cute little mushrooms strive to gather in a flock to tore you apart. All the environments are deadly — danger is everywhere. It arises from the darkness, lurks in the muddy water under the feet, descends from the ceiling behind you, oozes into your consciousness. Despite the grim and dismal ambience, the game gives an unforgettable feeling of the immense triumph after each of your victories. It transfers you to an awesome, mysterious and fearsome wandering you'll never forget. If you do decide to play Dark Souls, prepare to die. And may the Black Knight Halberd be with you!			"

												Dark Souls is easily one of the best games I’ve ever played. Although advertised as a game for “masochists only”, I believe anyone can enjoy this game once they gain a good understanding of how the game works. It doesn’t hold your hand, it doesn’t give you many breaks, and it tries to punish you in every way possible. But pushing through the difficulty is well worth it, trust me. Underneath all the pain is a great and engaging game, that relies on good awareness, and patience above all else.The fantasy setting is one of a kind, rich with history and characters that made me feel part of the world. From very early on, I wanted to discover everything and travel everywhere. I always had choices of where I went, and what I wanted to do. Whether it be farming for weapons/souls/crafting materials, or continuing with the normal progression.The multiplayer of Dark Souls is perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the game. Relying on temporarily working with or against other players for short periods of time. Your single player adventure could be interrupted by an invading player, or aided by a friendly player at almost any point. It makes things particularly exciting as you never know what to expect. With comparison to the sequel games in the Dark Souls series, this first game is much less user friendly in terms of fast travelling, inventory management, and general multiplayer features, but it’s still a solid foundation from which the next games were able to grow from.Overall there isn’t much I can complain about Dark Souls. It’s a game I will always come back to because it’s just that good. Don’t be put off by the difficulty because once you know how to overcome it, I promise you’ll fall in love with this game.			"

												Dark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition is the latest installment in a series of family games by critically acclaimed developer From Software. In it, you take on the role of a young Italian painter by the name of Adriano Abato, on his quest to restore color to the world and solve the mystery of why it was lost to begin with. Adriano is joined by his talking pet dog, Francesco, who brings some much needed levity to their journey with his many hilarious puns. Francesco has more to offer than just his sense of humor, however, and his tail doubles as a magical paintbrush to help Adriano return color to the world.Gameplay (8/10)The goal of the game is to obtain colors and then use them to return color to a monochrome world with your paintbrush. The more of the world that is restored this way, the closer to solving the mystery Adriano gets. While it is not necessary to repaint 100% of the world, there is a special secret in store for players with the patience and dedication to do so.The gameplay is split into four phases. In the first phase, Adriano and Francesco must travel to an area that has lost its colors. It's up to the player to decide where to go first, but some locations have a higher difficulty level than others. Decide for yourself what you feel capable of, but try to challenge your creative spirit!In the second phase, Adriano must find the Three Prime Colors of the area in question and convince them to aid him in restoring color to their surroundings. The three different Colors are Yellow, Blue and Red. Yellows will usually aid Adriano willingly because of their desire to return color to the sun, but in some cases Adriano will have to solve a riddle or prove himself first. Blues can be troublesome, particularly if Adriano hasn't restored a lot of churches yet. In most cases they will give Adriano a puzzle to solve, the difficulty of which depends on how much of the world's color has already been restored. The most troublesome Color by far is Red. The Reds will often say mean-spirited things to poor Adriano and try to ruin his paintings. They can be difficult to deal with, but with a bit of cunning and a hysterical joke from Francesco, Adriano will eventually be able to prevail.In the third phase, Adriano has to apply these colors to the canvas that is the monochrome world. Here, accuracy, speed and the number of colors collected is important. If Adriano gets careless he might not be able to properly restore color to the world, and if he is too slow the Colors might get impatient and escape again.The fourth phase is only unlocked after Adriano has restored a sufficient amount of the world's color. I won't spoil the details of this phase, but it's quite intense!There is also a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players where you compete to color a monochrome landscape as fast and as accurately as possible. There are some connectivity issues on the PC version, but with a bit of patience it shouldn't be hard to gather players for some creative painting fun.I give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay, which is both fun and addictive. The competitive multiplayer mode is particularly riveting, and many an evening was swallowed up in endless sessions of painting masterpieces with my fellow art enthusiasts from all over the world.Story (7/10)Prepare to Dye does not have a very complex storyline, but it doesn't need one, either. It's a family game for casual painting fun, and the plot reflects this. It's simple enough that a child can grasp it, but even adults will appreciate the tale of Adriano in the monochrome world. The twist at the end will also likely surprise most players, even if there are some clues to this twist scattered throughout the game. This is only obvious in retrospect, however.I give the story a 7/10, because while the story is not particularly advanced it does get the job done. It suits the game, and does not get too ambitious or take itself too seriously. It's a story anyone can jump into and enjoy.Characters (6/10)The primary characters are Adriano and Francesco. Adriano is a cheerful young artist with a knack for making those around him smile. His optimistic and carefree nature allowed him to avoid the influence of the monochrome world, and he now wants to restore color to the rest of the world. Francesco, his talking dog, is similar to his owner in many ways, but has a knack for clever wordplay that sometimes goes over Adriano's head. Nonetheless, the player won't be able to stop laughing at his wonderful jokes.The personalities of the Colors are not particularly complicated, and are mostly covered in the section about gameplay above. There are certain characters later in the game worth mentioning, but spoiling the nature of these characters would not be fair to would-be players.While the characters are quite endearing, I can't give this section more than 6/10. There is little in the way of character development, and there isn't a lot of character variation.Controls: (4/10)Dark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition was ported from the Nintendo Wii to PC, and as a port it does have some issues. The original game relied heavily on the Wiimote's motion control for the painting parts of the game, and this was only awkwardly replaced with a system using the mouse and keyboard on PC.It's difficult to play the game as intended on PC, and many blame the rushed release of the PC version for this. There are mods to fix the controls, but, despite this, I can't really give the game more than a 4/10 for the controls as they are by default. While the developers did have a difficult job porting a motion control game to the PC, they should have taken their time to properly implement the controls, rather than rushing the port like they did.Graphics (7/10)As I already mentioned, the game was ported from the Nintendo Wii, and the port is less than ideal. This can also be seen in the graphics, as the game doesn't support resolutions a PC player would consider acceptable. While this too can be fixed with mods, it should still be considered a problem with the port.Resolutions aside, the game itself is absolutely gorgeous. The haunting and simplistic beauty of the monochrome world is only surpassed by the gorgeous and vibrant landscapes that result from restoring color to the world. While the designs of the characters are significantly more simplistic by comparison, they suit the overall atmosphere of the game. In many ways they resemble characters from a children's picture book.Despite the issues with resolutions, I give the graphics a 7/10. The low resolution makes the game seem significantly older than it is, but even with this handicap the game looks gorgeous. With mods it might be one of the most beautiful titles on Steam.Sound (8/10)From Software is well known for its upbeat and catchy tunes, and Prepare to Dye is certainly no exception to this rule. In the monochrome world, the music is somber, but as color is restored to the world, the music grows livelier and more colorful as well. Once color is fully restored, the music gives you a happy sense of accomplishment. It's like an auditory representation of the canvas Adriano restored to life.The voice acting is a bit cheesy, however. The stereotypical Italian accents of Adriano and Francesco get more endearing once you get used to it, but the fact that the Colors and the other NPCs have standard American accents is a bit off-putting.That said, the voice acting can't pull down the overall sound score too much, as dialogue is not very important in Prepare to Dye. The music speaks more for the game than the voices do, and so I give the game an 8/10 for sound.Conclusion (7/10)Overall I give this game a 7/10. While it has many issues, it's a gorgeous classic made by a beloved game developer. I highly recommend giving it a try if you enjoy painting and art in general.			"

												I have to admit that I avoided Dark Souls for an unhealthy amount of time. Rarely playing games above the normal difficulty, the appeal of it being a really hard and unforgiving game wasn't the most compelling. I'm glad I changed my mind though, because I may have had missed out on a game I now consider one of the best of the decade.The gameplay is fun and engaging. The art, hauntingly beautiful and original. The soundtrack, breathtaking. But what really makes Dark Souls a masterpiece, by perfectly uniting all its elements, is the world of Lordran. Its cohesive design made me question every videogame world I'd experienced up to that point. From the wastes below the very backbone of the land up to the very top of the tallest tower of the tallest castle, the world's vertical and intrinsic design never fails to maintain its authenticity and unimpaired flow. After transversing the map not too many times, I could - and still can, months after actively playing the game - definitely draw a convincing transcription of it, with all its shortcuts and intersections. In a journey through Lordram, rarely does it feel like an area is forgettable or unused.Dark Souls has no narrative. There are no quests, maps, or journals. What it has is the world of Lordran. The story is presented to the player through unusual elements. Item descriptions. NPCs - that have their own agenda. And most importantly, through the other main elements of the game: music, visuals, gameplay. You are never given a codex or anything like what most RPGs have. You have to pay attention and intentionally pursue the story elements to make any sense out of it. Or you can ignore that and go slay a wide array of creatures and superbly designed bosses - it's just as fun. As is taking part in the clever and unique co-op and PvP elements. To top it all off, the atmosphere through most of the game is unmatched. But that comes as no surprise after praising the world and its cohesiveness for so long.A must-play if I've ever seen one, Dark Souls is as a fresh experience as it is a throwback to a kind of fun recent videogames seemed to have forgotten.

												The first and arguably the best.Pros+ Great replay value+ Good DLC included in the game+ Complex and rich storyline+ Solid character progression and progress rewards+ Still provides a solid challenge at most levelsCons- Still requires dsm fix and other external addons to allow for proper gameplay with a keyboard- DSM Conectivity Mod still basically a requirement for online play- Some covenant acheivements are now very difficult due to either long farming or slow online grinding with a low player baseKill the dogs first.

												Dark Souls is a hard game at first. It's oppresive, it's relentless, it's punishing and it won't hold your hand. You will be confused, and you WILL die. So prepare to die.Yet, as you progress through the game, you'll get the hang of it. After dying time and time again you'll learn how to tell if an enemy is going to attack you and how powerful that attack will be. You'll learn faster routes to get to your objective. And you'll learn to detach yourself from the souls you get. You WILL lose them. The point isn't to constantly grind - the point is to learn. And while a couple hundreds souls will be an awful lot during early game, by the end you can farm tens thousands of them in a couple of minutes.Take your time, be patient. It's mostly about the journey, and the elation you'll feel when overcoming the obstacles - the insurmountable odds against you, the unbreakable barrier. You'll die and then you'll learn and then you will achieve victory.So Praise the Sun!			"

												Don't let the game's sub-title scare you away. This is a very fun and most importantly fair game with great combat and exploration. Yes, the port sucks, but with mods like PvP Watchdog, Wulf's Dark Souls Connectivity Mod (DSCM), and DSFix, the game looks great and plays even better. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys RPGs with no player handholding.Edit: I would like to refer anyone who wants to get started with those mods I mentioned to this guide:

												Let me tell you something you already know. This game ain't no sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. Not you, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as Dark Souls. But it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can GET hit and keep moving forward, how much you can TAKE and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done, but you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying ""I can't beat this game because of Gargoyles, Capra Demon or anybody! Cowards fo that and that ain't you!Now go beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game.			"

 Prepare to die This game took me nearly 60 hours to complete it  once ...This game is pretty hard but the award is hella great! I love how the game treats you like garbage and awards you like a King.This is definitely a game for the patient. It is hard, but fair and requires that you LEARN from your mistakes, instead of running in and hoping for the best. The entire area is a potential advantage or disadvantage depending on how you use it, so it requires that you think about what you're going to do before you try to fight. It isn't for everyone, if you like hack and slash, run for the hills, if you want a challenge, dish out the cash and buy Dark Souls.*RECOMMENDED*			"

												What's there to say? This game is legendary!This is a masterpiece of our gaming age.It's certainly not for everyone. It's a love or hate. More like: you hate it but you grow to like it, even though you still hate it often. And it's bloody hard. At first ;)Let's start at the beginning, even if there's already a new niche made-up game genre called ""souls-like"", essentially this game is a 3D metroidvania fantasy adventure arpg game. It really is just that.What's so unique about it you ask? Well it takes ""not holding your hand"" concept to the extreme, freedom in its true sense, meaning - you don't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥and you don't know where to go and what to do! A true adventure!It's hard and unpredictable, it's pure exploration in its base meaning, you explore how world works, what's around the corner, what the heck is that giant thing is (followed by ""You're dead""), what happens if this and ""OH SHI.. I shouldn't have done that"". Unfortunately it makes the plot ""hard to get"", it's weird at first to milk NPCs for dialogues and discovering the world through... spells' descriptions?... but it gets addictive after you're hooked, trying to find out why that boss is like that and drops what he drops or noticing the link between some enemies present in different locations etc. Exciting for those who like that kind of thing.And what about the main thing here - Combat?! Well it's AWESOME!The combat system is what makes Souls games so great. At first you hate it so much, you can't survive simple enemies, not mentioning the big bosses (the small ones are even worse).But then you learn it bit by bit and start to enjoy it. And there's lots to discover because: Lots of weapon types, different move sets Unique and Boss weapons with unique perks Weight and Poise system, which seriously affects battle Parry and Riposte system (also backstabbing), hard to master but rewarding Shield or Roll. There's no evasion stat or random chances, you learn to roll or leash out your (tower) shield, IF you can wield it ;) Lots of rings, each greatly affecting various aspects Mix and match left and right arms separately and several slots/sets to switch between Magic, Miracles, Pyromancy: wide array of magic skills to specialize or add to main buildAnd that's only combat, add these Pros to the bunch and you got yourself a prize: Non-linear gameplay, no hand holding if you don't want it Unique co-op and pvp system Various covenants (you can call them guilds or alliances for better understanding) for PvE rewards or PvP action & else Unique style, world and enemies. Environment is freaky but interesting. Somewhat unique levelling system and skills system Skill based. It's a common challenge in Souls games to beat the game without levelling a single time.It still has it's own cons of course, some harsh ones, because it's THE legendary Dark Souls ;D You will die a lot, but it's not the end. Be prepared to fail and get up. Your nerves will most likely be tested and even messed up. A lot of adrenaline too. Story is hard to find and hard to follow at times. Invasion system is a big turn-off for some in an already unforgiving game. It's an interesting system but it ♥♥♥♥s you up often. There's always offline mode though. You don't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥ Trial and error approach. It's a debatable pro-or-con. Hard to get hooked from your first session. Many of us have started this game multiple times before really getting to love it. It's this game quirk and a part that makes it great in fact.So there you have it. Dark Souls. Such a game, it's a love-hate relationship in it's bliss.I call it a BDSM of gaming sometimes. It's a queen dominatrix at that. But it's greatness obliterates any unnerving breakdown you will have while playing. You WILL start it up again even after ragequitting. Believe me :)So if you're not afraid of challanges and tough games, if you are ready to test your gaming skills and not just relax and sit back while playing after a hard day. This is worth it!P.S. the community can be harsh with comments like condescending ""git gud"" and ""this is dark souls"", but be sure there are lots of us who likes and wants to help by word and co-op on the forums/discussions, lots of friendly people.  P.P.S. what's more interesting the online in this game is still very much alive and kicking! "

												You won't like this game. Don't buy it. You will die repeatedly. The game will actively punish you for every misstep, forcing you to swim upstream, suffer, and learn from your failures. It will eat your soul, and spit it back onto your mangled, decaying corpse. Over and over again. And then it will sit back on it's throne, waiting for you to come back for more.It's also the most rewarding, challenging, and hands down the best game I've ever played. This is a masterpiece that only a fortunate, and patient few, will ever get to fully experience.Praise the sun!			"

												After 48 grueling hours of playtime, I had finally beaten Sif, the Four Kings, Seath The Scaleless, and Nito. I climbed down past the bog, in my noble sorcerers cloth, with boots and gauntlets of gold metal salvaged from Ornstien's soul it's self. Lighting the path in front of me with only the glint of my estoc and the afterglow of magic, when the path before me lighted up by it's self, a orange, firey glowIN FRONT OF ME, sat OVER FOURTY kangaroo/dinosaur hybrids, a field of lava that could only be traversed by walking on it, and no bonfire in sight for over 5 minutes of travel time through the ruined city. I had to lose some weight to travel at my fastest, and I took off my gauntlets and replaced my boots with common shoes. I put on my lava ring, and snuck across the side of the monsterous area, constantly having to find a dry rock to heal myself on.And then promptly got sat on, instantly died, and had to restart, having lost all my experience points and money. This finally broke me, and all of my normal senses vanished, and my stubbernness was replaced, not by greater determination, but conceeding to follow the rules of the game instead.I got entirely naked, put on a hat bigger than my already barreled chest, a dinky knight's shield I had picked up 8 levels back, and ♥♥♥♥ING SPRINTED AS FAST AS I COULD. This morphed in to twenty minutes of speedily scouting the area ahead, then using it to formulate a plan to continue going fast enough to dodge every enemy attack. At one point, a friend messaged me with a simple link that lead to a mashup between ""Escape the City"" from Sonic the Hedgehog, and the ghostbusters theme.This proved to be a great theme, and I pushed forward, eventually finding the bed of chaos.This lead to two more hours of sprinting with nothing but a gigantic hat, my naked fat black body slapping across dinosaurs as I body'd them out of the way, and sprinted in to the boss with my magically enchanted shield, and then eventually killing the main boss by doing 6 damage to it by hitting it with my staff. I literally jumped from my desk, raised my hands in the air and screamed ""YES!"", as my headphones ripped out of the jack and my speakers came alive, in the middle of a solo between the ghostbusters theme and sonic the hedgehog yelling in his ever so annoying voice ""FOLLOW ME, SET ME FREE, TRUST ME AND WE CAN ESCAPE FROM THE CITY""Would I recommend this game?I can't imagine how to describe the experience. It was wonderful and yet I truely wish, hope, PRAY, that I never experience it again. My thumb rating would be 4 out of 2 thumbs cut off.Since steam doesn't abide by this, thumbs up for solaire. He's a pretty cool guy.			"

												tl;dr --> game good. game not hard. game punishing. you like punishing? get game.This is a very poor port of a very good game.Luckily there are a couple of fixes around that make it play like an actual pc game; check the pinned threads on the game's discussions to find everything you need.By now you probably heard of Dark Souls only through statements like""omg dis gaem is like so hard i died liek 50 times in teh tutoriel lol xd""and thanks to that the sequels have been advertised with difficulty being the main attraction, but the game never really focuses on being hard for the sake of being hard: it just doesn't hold your hand, at all, and that's why it feels so good to overcome the obstacles the game throws at you, because from start to finish it is entirely your own victory... unless you read a walkthrough, then shame on you, you filthy casul.So what can you expect from this game?Well they don't call it the ""Prepare To Die™ Edition"" for nothing, lolPrepare to die a lot, not because of the game, but because you suck at it; dying punishes you putting you back at the last bonfire you rested at, respawning all enemies, and taking away all your precious souls you have in possession at the time of death (you need those to level up). You have one chance to get them back at the spot you died at, but if you die again before recovering them, they're gone forever. But as long as you don't lose your experience, your patience and you don't give up, dying matters very little: no matter how many souls you lose, each time you go back you're stronger... not your character, but you as a player.Prepare for an excellent combat system with a very good feel to the melee combat in particular, forget Skyrim and its hundreds of weapons that are all reskins of the same one, here weapons have all different movesets, range, properties... and most of all they still hit the enemy even if you don't point the crosshair at them (yes I'm still looking at Skirim smh); all attacks have an animation that you can't cancel (unless you get hit) so you're committed to every strike, you can't treat it like a hack'n'slash and start hacking'n'slashing left and right, that will get you killed fast.Prepare to have no map... so you better remember how to get back to that door you skipped because you had no key to open it. You will almost never feel the need of a map however, thanks to the clever level design and the fact each area looks unique.Prepare to have no story spoonfed to you... as in, little to no cutscenes showcasing big events. Nothing much happens in this ""story"" because the ""story"" already happened: all the epic fights, the shiny castles, the people smiling... they're all gone. You have no idea what happened when you arrive here, but you can piece together information from item descriptions and locations and NPC dialogues to get an idea of what it was like before and how it's come to this. Or, you can also not do it if you don't want, and complete the game without really knowing why... up to you.Prepare for silence... only boss battles and a few very special places have music, and it's 100% Motoi Sakuraba goodness.Prepare to be alone... but not quite... multiplayer works in a very interesting way, blending together singleplayer and multiplayer seamlessly. In short, coop is temporary and limited to an area, you can ""summon"" other players into your gameworld and fight together, until the area boss dies... or one of you dies.Prepare for pvp... yes, in the same way you can summon players, other players can also enter your world without your consent, and really ruin your day. Before you get scared, don't worry, there are areas where multiplayer is restricted, and playing in hollow form will prevent any multiplayer interaction anywhere.Prepare to hate the game at first... but expect to sooner or later fall in love with it... they all do in the end...Prepare to Praise the Sun... you'll know when you meet him.

												Family friendly game that's forgiving to newer players of the Demon Souls series. The cheerful tutorial NPCs guide you through the very first stages of the game. The campfires that are discovered among the way give you some breathing room from the complex puzzles such as how to log into Games for Windows LIVE. 10/10 Recommended to people who have low tolerance and patience levels for some easy, light-hearted puzzle gameplay.This game wants to make me kill my self.

												Dark Souls is a game I avoided for years based on reputation. I'll admit it, I was afraid of a game this challenging. I started and gave up on Dark Souls a few times, but my most recent attempt had me falling head over heels in love. This is one of the best RPGs I've ever played, and one that offers so much more to it than simply difficulty. In a sea of games that assume you're an idiot, this title wants you to explore, fail, and succeed in ways never spelled out directly. The PC version needs several mods to bring it up to the standards one would expect performance wise, but in spite of the glitches and oddities Dark Souls is one of the premier titles available, and a game that is well and truly timeless.

												If you like casual games like Dora The Explorer and Peggle, you're gonna love Dark Souls. After playing through 4 times without dying, I can say that this is the most casual game I've ever played, I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't play for the challenge, but for the story.Remember to hit every single NPC you see on your way, for extra fun, ofc!

DISCLAIMER: I have never played Demon Souls, and I play Dark Souls 2 (See my review) before I played this.  I was waiting for GFWL to be gone.Onward.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: After playing DS2, my first thought on DS1 was ""Wow this game looks bad"".  I thought it was grainy and ugly and honestly had a hard time.  A friend recommended I get DSFIX and some other tweaks and the game looked and ran much better after that.This game is NOT DS2, I learned that pretty quickly.  I was a cheesy ranged magic user in DS2 and in this one, I hated magic right off the bat, it was so slow.  I was forced to learn melee play more than I had before.  Man did I start to finally learn some mechanics I missed even after an entire play-through of DS2.  I learned how to properly roll and dodge, how to properly parry and back-stab.  Fun stuff.  I mean I had done it before, but then crutched out on ranged combat so never had to master it.Not to say I did not use ranged in this game.  I just used a Bow to pull certain enemies and kill others.  More fun than magic.CONTROL: Again, I am doing this backwards since I played DS2 first.  Once you have it down, the game controls well.  It seems a lot cleaner than DS2, tighter.  I did not seem to get ""cheap"" shotted as much.  If you played DS2 first like me, you'll be fine.COMBAT: Fluid, scary!!  The enemies hit HARD, all of them, and as I said above, the control is key to getting good at the combat.  Ranged piercing hits are kind of overpowered so get a weapon that does that to ease things up a bit if you are having problems.The bosses in this game I had heard were hard.  Some of them to be honest simply kicked the living crap out of me so often it is embarrassing.  I am a slow learner but I don't get frustrated.  Watch the boss mechanics, move around a lot, and be SMART with your blocks and stamina and all bosses become much easier.  I HATED the Stray Demon and all things like him (@&^*%#@&^% those things).STORY: As with DS2, I did not follow the story much.  This game is all about fighting for me.  I thought DS2 had more interesting characters that followed you through the game more though.  Quite possible I missed something though.WORLD: Holy hell did I get confused by this world.  I had no clue where to go first, what to do, etc.  I felt less hand held and directed than I was in DS2.  I frequently went to areas that were WAY too hard for me (hollow Catacombs and Tomb!) way before I should be there.  I found myself repeating areas over and over to just practice combat and build up souls for weapon improving more that anything for a long timeEventually I learned how the entire world links together VERY well, and it is all connected and loops together brilliantly.  The fact that you can't warp around right from the start (You can later... way later for me ;P) is actually a blessing in disguise.OTHER: I put 120+ hrs into this game before I finally beat it.  If this review is anything like my DS2 one.  Someone will tell me how much I suck.  Well, so what if I suck.  I had 120+ hours of fun and have put in 20+ more since.I would love to see a ""Collection"" edition that had Demon Souls so I could play that one.  Bloodborne will make me buy a PS4 simply because it is a ""Dark Souls"" type game.I loved this game, I loved part 2 (I play to play a melee only DS2 run now ;P)Go play it.			"

												PREPARE TO BE ROYALLY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF EDITION  Is what is should be called... This is my first time going through this game and must i say the emersiveness and skill base meant for this game is mindblowing. I'm playing with a keyboard and mouse and i truly feel i need a controller with this game. The game has some intense action based attacks and realstic movements. I have to say this is one of the most intuitive and intense games i have ever played. As much as i die in this game shows how much i want to play more and more in this game.    This game will test you, psychologically, cognitively, and embark you in some many challenges you'll finally know what it's like to actually play A GAME! This isn't one of those story driven easy to play games you normally play on playstation or Xbox. This isn't the typical pc game that you play to push competitive play... This is a game that challenges YOU on how fast you can adapt, how fast you can learn and how fast anticipate your oppoent and survive. This game has survival base to it, it has strategy to it and it puts you in the mentality to want to win, want to survive, and want to finish it and kill those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that killed you and stole you 3000 souls.... STUPID DEMON PIECES OF ....... *whew* sorry lost myself there..... Anyways i recommend this game... Expect to be challenged.... Expect to die.... and Expect to come out being a better gamer with this game. Enjoy it... Live it.... and Survive it!			"

												Dark Souls is one of my absolute favorite games of the generation.It features a giant interconnected world with tons of hidden areas to explore. The game is challenging but not overwhelming so. Dying is a necessary aspect of learning the game but once you get the hang of it, progression can offer a very strong sense of accomplishment. The combat is rock solid and skill based with each of the weapons having their very own unique move-set. Dark Souls has RPG elements and an extremely unique multiplayer component. It's set up as a single player game but you can occasionally see the ghosts of other players which can offer hints on where (or where not to go). Players can also leave notes for one another and can be summoned to help with the many bosses. On the other hand, they can also invade your world and attempt to kill you. Dark Souls also offers plenty of replayability. It's not uncommon to spend 50 hours or so on your initial playthrough and once you complete the game, it has a New Game+ where everything becomes increasingly difficult. I've played through the game four times on Xbox and it never gets old.Just make sure you play the game with a controller as it isn't very keyboard and mouse friendly.For a more indepth and thorough review, check out my video:

												This game is Nito. It really made my friends and me Gwyn. It Taurus apart, but we kept asking for Smough; it was a Ceaseless Discharge. It did a good job to Manus up, so we didn't blame Quelaag. It's Artoriasly hard, but it's not that bad once you Sif through it. It left Ornstein on my life. Just know you're getting into a Bed of Chaos.Did you Seath what I did there? (Capra)			"

												I used to have a favourite game. I can't remember it anymore. This brutal son of a game took my heart the moment I killed Taurus Demon. Is the game hard? Yes. Is it cheesy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ instant death-hard? No. Every single time you die, you die because you did something wrong. What a wonderful challenge to play. Even after five years it's the pinnacle of gaming for me.All the areas in the game are so distinct and well-crafted. Almost everything in this game just clicks. And then there's the ♥♥♥♥ing amazing score. Every boss has their own theme and I remember every single one of them. The story is told by pieces.

 Difficulty Let's get the obvious out of the way. Is this game challenging? Yes. Is this game hard for new players? Yes. Is this game impossible? Absolutely not. This game has a reputation for being a very hard game, sometimes being dubbed ""The Hardest Game Ever."" I will tell you right now that while the game is hard in the beginning, especially for new players, it can easily be learned. It is just another game in which the level designers introduce escalating challenges for the player to face. The game starts off showing you the basic controls (attacking, dodging, healing etc.) but those who pay attention can notice that the game is slowly introducing the player to how certain challenges must be approached (fighting one target, fighting multiple target, fighting ranged targets etc.). The golden rule is to watch your surroundings, and watch your enemies. You will be able to figure things out for yourself, because though the game may not tell you outright, it does show you the ropes before it throws you into the fire. Of course you may get stuck in some parts and there is no shame in looking at a guide. I did as well in the beginning. But before you do, look around the world and look for places you have not seen before. If the area is new, and the enemies are not too hard to fight, then you are going the right way. Gameplay This game is very satisfying. If you are new to Dark Souls then you will die, very often. But that is the whole point of the game so do not feel discouraged. This game will be hard in some parts, and you will come across an obstacle that seems impossible to defeat. But when you accomplish the task, and you will, you will feel amazing. You are also given a wide variety of weapons and armor to use. Each weapon has a specific move set that fulfills some task. When you find the armor and weapons that fit your play style, upgrade them and have fun. Weapons are another aspect of this game that are very satisfying. The weapons, ranging from practical to ridiculous, all have a weighted feeling to them. You don't just blindly swing a sword around like Skyrim, there is timing involved. When you get a hit in and you watch the enemies health go down, you will feel like a million dollars. Story Along with the difficulty, the story also has a reputation. Much like the gameplay, the story is left up to the player for the most part. You are given an intro cinematic which lays down the history of the world. But once you are in the game proper the story is really only told through NPC dialogue and item descriptions. This makes the story a little bit of a mystery, you being the one who takes in information and clues to piece together the more in depth history of the world. Even when you have finished this game you can spend days watching videos of people explaining what happened in events before the game, and events that are happening in the game. Something as simple as armor next to a bonefire, or a suspicious item in someones treasure chest can open up entire stories. Levels The entire world is seamlessly connected. Except for a few areas that require special passage, the different areas are interconnected and it is possible to walk from each and every one without having a single loading screen. This helps  make the world seem more alive and grand, especially when, in some cases you are able to see one area from another. The visuals are also amazing. Whether it be from the top of a mountain peak or through a lush forest the atmosphere will certainly drag you in. However in some parts of the game, the framerate will go down drastically. Multiplayer I don't believe Multiplayer was the main focus of this game, however it is present. Online play shows in the form of covenants, different groups that fulfill some role. Some covenants like the Warriors of Sunlight are available to help you out, while others like the Darkwraiths will join your game with the main goal of killing you. These days, the Darkwraiths are the only ones around, and connecting with people to COOP is nearly impossible. It has been patched but in my experience, online play is not very common. DS Fix DS Fix is a mod that I highly suggest players to get. One of the biggest problems with Dark Souls for some people is the fact that the game is locked at 30 FPS. This mod unlocks the framerate allowing one to reach 60 fps and solve some of the visual issues that people experience. Cons I highly suggest this game and I find it Overwhelmingly positive, however here are some things that one should keep in mind.-Framerate is locked at 30, and in some places will go even lower making the game hard to play. Use DS Fix and this problem should be remedied-Near the end of the game, some areas seem rushed in their design. One major boss in particular is notable for being rather lazy, and requires more luck than skill in order to fight. This is something the entire community will agree is the lowest point of the game-Online play is not handled well. Though it is unique, you will have a better chance of being invaded by an enemy than you are being able to play with a friend. Though the strongest element of Dark Souls is it's single player so this should not be a problem-This game can really only be played with a controller. If you do not have one I suggest waiting on buying this game until you can get one. There is a keyboard and mouse setting but it is very difficult to play with. Final Word Dark Souls is truly a unique experience for any player. I've seen people put off by the difficulty at first and then eventually return to it hooked (This happened to me). If you are a fan of story and lore, this game is rich in it's atmosphere, world building, and unique presentation. Gameplay fluctuates from a fast panicked pace to slow anxious one. There are a variety of weapons that one can pick up and use to fit their play style. Overall this game is an experiment in determination. Every challenge can be completed and every enemy can be defeated. If you have learned the elements of the game, and have adapted to its rules, you will succeed. I highly recommend this game.Good Luck, and don't you dare go Hollow.			"

												It's insane how much content they could fit in the game. Sure, the texture quality might not be the greatest (but take note that the game itself is from 2011) but the level design is TOP NOTCH. In some areas you just need to take a breather and take a look around. For example in Anor Londo, the view is gorgeous as the hints on the ground suggest.This game has an incredible way to tell a story through the environment. You won't be bugged with long cutscenes of certain incidents, you'll just hear of them through the NPCs, like merchants.The game creates an atmoshpere that you'll find hard to drag yourself out of. I myself found it difficult to stop thinking of the new areas I could find in the future, hours after closing the game. And so, the game kept luring me back in.Sure. The game is difficult to someone jumping into the specific playstyle-genre for the first time. But still, after a lot of trial and error, beating a single boss fight after a half an hour learning its attack patterns, success feels rewarding.In conclusion this game is a gem worth the praise it gets. I myself would rate it a solid 9/10 (would've given 10 if it wasn't for the clumsy pc port, which could've been improved a bit).			"

												Easily one of the best games I've ever played, Dark Souls is a fantastic challenge for those up to it. Yes, it's advertised as brutally difficult and has a reputation as such, but really, if you take your time and play with strategy it's actually incredibly fun. You should know by a couple bosses in, excluding the asylum demon, if this game is for you. 10/10, fully recommend.			"

												As long as you use a controller and the DSFix mod, this is the definitive version of Dark Souls.Dark Souls is one of the richest, most rewardingly deep RPGs of all time to ever grace any system, and now it's available on the trinity of gaming:  PC, PS3, and Xbox 360. You have no excuse not to buy this game. This game is worth purchasing a controller for, and I've logged more than 1000 hours on the game amongst the three systems I play it on. No matter which system you buy it for, you will not regret it.Dark Souls will challenge you. Perpare to die.			"

												Don't get greedy. This is the golden rule of Dark Souls, and the key to your success or failure playing it.Story-wise, the game is deceptively simple. At first appearance there is little information given, you are told almost nothing and given a surprisingly large world to fight in. But this is what a lot of people love about Dark Souls - you get out of it what you put into it. Dig a little bit below the surface and there is actually a vast lore with tons of information, detective work and speculation for you to piece together if you are perceptive and observant. Item descriptions tell an entire world's worth of details, occasional lines of NPC small talk reveal facts that can expand the lore by surprising amounts, details in the landscape give inferences to greater world events. The only times you are directly told something important you can be sure as hell the tellers have an angle they are pushing and it probably isn't the full picture.World design-wise, you have a surprisingly large stage to explore and, most importantly, it *feels* like you are exploring a massive land in a fading world rather than a set of different levels. Just about everywhere in the game is interconnected and criss-crosses with other areas in some way, you can walk from one area to another and then look back and see exactly where you came from and look forwards and know you'll eventually get there (and sometimes even see tiny orange player messages in the distance, which is a nice touch). The shortcuts exemplify this, it genuinely feels like everything is one large castle.Mechanics-wise, see the first sentence. This is a game of patience and cat-and-mouse baiting. Lure enemies into one-on-one combat, don't get flanked, learn when to tank and when to evade, plan your attack movements, use everything and anything to your advantage. Death has little meaning as everything lost on death can be infinitely regained, so it becomes a learning mechanism rather than a punishment. Sometimes the lesson may be 'go elsewhere' or 'try a different method.'Character building can vary greatly. Do you want to be a heavy knight with a massive weapon, or a dexterous archer, or a tactical mage? The beginning class choice is essentially meaningless in the long run, it just determines what gear you start with and gives you some stats you'd have even with a different class (eg you'll probably end up putting some points into faith so for the heal miracle regardless of your build). You can effectively beat the game with almost any playstyle or build, though some are definitely easier than others.Use humanity at a bonfire to un-hollow yourself and you can summon other players to help you fight areas and bosses at the risk of being invaded and killed by someone else. There are also NPCs who can be summoned and even invade you, which is nice if you're offline, though there are sometimes conditions for summoning them such as them having been in the previous boss fight or them invading you and defeating them.There are some spots it suffers from poor design, let's be honest. These are generally not so much in terms of enemies or player options but in terms of terrain and meshes - the Great Hollow is a good example of this, sometimes you will go flying down and to the side to your death because god forbid you touched the wrong angled mesh despite having had an apparently clear angle to your destination. The Bed of Chaos is especially obnoxious with this, but the less said about that the better. The Painted World doesn't mesh with the rest of the game very well, it's more or less where the devs put half-finished ideas that they didn't want to throw out, which is a pity because information on the stage itself and boss are very interesting but rather undeveloped and could have been expanded on much more (I was especially disappointed that I couldn't return the doll to its owner). Most of the game has excellent level design, however, the exceptions to this are only exceptions and not the rule.I am not skilled enough at pvp to really go into it, look elsewhere for an analysis on that. I will say that in my experience pvp has been annoyingly full of longer-range bleed weapons and little else in terms of variety, lag is also very much present and will lead to you missing when you clearly connected and getting hit or backstabbed when you were clear across the area.All in all, brilliant game that you will probably quit the first time you play it then come back to much later and eventually enjoy. Takes time to 'get it' which can be considered both a major weakness of it and a massive strength to it. Just about every bit of progress you've made (both in-game and in understanding/learning the game) is a result of your own effort and accomplishment, very little is given to you so again you get out of it what you put into it.Note that due to the devs self-admittedly being inexperienced at PC porting, there are some native issues. These are mostly fixed by getting DSfix and configuring it for whatever needs to be tweaked for your setup. Edit: since it was updated to run off Steam directly some parts of the DSfix may need to be altered or disabled to get it working properly.			"

												I like Dark Souls, it's not for everyone, but you might like it too. You probably don't need me to tell you that Dark Souls has a reputation for being balls hard, and while it's not an unmerited reputation it has more to do with the game deciding that the player can do without certain conveniences rather than dicking you over. The new XCOM is a game that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you over by letting your squadmates perma-die, roguelikes often♥♥♥♥♥♥you over by starting the game over when you die. Those are features added to make the game harder and while I have nothing wrong with either if they're implemented well, Dark Souls uses subtraction, which is a subtler bouquet. So modern gaming conveniences that are generally thought of as necessary for smooth gameplay have been thrown aside. So while I don't think the bosses in Dark Souls (which are generally regarded as being brutal) are tougher on paper than any other third-person action game of this type  (they don't take a ludicrous amount of damage, attack patterns aren't hard to learn) the game doesn't do you any favors in getting past them. When you die you don't immediately respawn at the start of the battle and have to work your way back, you can't load up on enough health items to forgo learning the boss's patterns.Playing Dark Souls is like giving up your smart phone for a day. ""Oh wow, it is possible to exist without being connected to eleven different social networks while being in perpetual contact with hunderds of people!"" I'm not saying I want every game to wantonly cut the fat like Dark Souls, but it's nice to know that I don't need my hand held, that I can be expected to figure out a crafting system on my own, that I can be expected to discover things without any prompting. It's all very empowering.I also think Dark Souls makes some smart choices to distinguish itself from similar RPGs. First off it doesn't feature an open world. I'm not a huge fan of open worlds. I think it's more challenging to craft a small gameworld where every step is deliberately placed, every nook and cranny there for a reason, than to make a big♥♥♥♥♥map and then scatter a few waypoints even across it. Every thing you find and every where you go in Dark Souls feels like you figured out and uncovered rather than just being something you stumbled upon. Plus, if you get stuck in one direction and feel like exploring you know you're always going to find something new if you push along that path you were stuck at before. You're never going to waste your time because the developer didn't drop something cool where you decided to explore.Dark Souls also handles weapons and armor brilliantly. There are very few inately bad weapons and none that so completely out-class others that they make other options pointless. You find a weapon with a moveset you like and then, with upgrades through the crafting system you can take that weapon all the way to the final boss. It's a perfect way to defeat the RPG trope of, reach new town, buy new weapon/armor set, fight boss.Of course Dark Souls is a game that requires dedication and patience. Not everyone will have the time and attention to dedicate 80+ hours to get through. If you do though it's a unique and satisfying experience.			"

Posted: November 30, 2015
												Heads up: this is not a review on the actual content of the game, this is a review on how good of a PC port this is in comparison to the original verison of the game.This is a very good game, but unfortunately I can't recommend it because this port is the absolute worst port I've ever seen of any game in my life. The main problems I notice is that the keyboard controls make absolutely no sense at all and that the button tutorials at the beginning are actually for an Xbox controller, which I was not using so they did not help me at all. I can understand that it's highly recommended to use a controller, but since I'm playing this on a PC I should be able to use a keyboard if that's what I prefer or if it's all I have. The keyboard controls could have easily been done better. I pressed every single key and not a single one of them opened up the main game menu. I had to force quit the game just so I could get back to the title screen and the options menu. And again, it just looks extemely lazy to reuse the tutorials from the Xbox version when someone is playing with a keyboard on a PC.The other main thing I have to complain about with this port is the performance issues. I experience constant framerate drops while playing that make this game almost as unplayable as the controls do. However, I have heard that basically everyone who buys this game for PC has the same problems, and as a result there are mods out there that fix these problems and--I have to admit--actually seem to make this version perform better than the console version. But am I the only one who thinks that it's a major flaw when a game needs to be modded just to be playable?All I can end with is: if you own a Playstation 3 or an Xbox 360, you would be saving yourself a tremendous amount of trouble by just getting the console version of this game. I have played this game on 360 and the controls are great and the performance is flawless (with the exception of the notorious Blighttown framerate).TL;DR  This game is unplayable without modding it to improve performance and using a controller. If you don't own a controller and/or don't want to mod the game, then you're better off getting the console version if you own a PS3 or 360.EDIT: Calling this port unplayable may not be entirely accurate and a little harsh. I personally went out and purchased an Xbox controller and spent an entire afternoon modding the game, and now I have to say I find it better than the console version of the game. But I still have to say that this game will be VERY difficult for anyone to enjoy in its default state. I still cannot for the life of me set up the keyboard controls in a way that is comfortable or at least not confusing (also still never found a key for the menu in the default controls). Also, I don't know if I'm in the majority or the minority with the performance problems. Most people I've talked to or heard talk about this port highly recommend the DSfix mod to make the game run more smoothly. So this is a common problem but not a problem that every single person who downloads the game experiences.After tweaking the game myself I think I can say that if you're someone who doesn't mind using a controller and possibly going out of your way to install a mod or two, then I recommend this game to you 110% (assuming of course you know what Dark Souls is and what you're getting yourself into). But I am still going to leave this as a negative review, because what I'm reviewing here is how the game is in its present default state, not how it is with a controller and a bit of modding. And frankly, in its default state this port is just...bad.			"

												Nominated for the ""Just 5 more minutes"" award.What can I say? The whole game is based around just five more minutes. Whether it's just five more minutes until I get back to the boss, just five more minutes until I get to the next bonfire checkpoint, or just five more minutes(hours) until I give up.Dark souls is both a challenging and methodical approach to the modern day dungeon crawler, and plays similar to an action RPG. Areas are intricately crafted with beautiful scenery, and every enemy and item has a purpose and reason for being there. So whether it's because you decided to walk the wrong direction at Firelink Shrine or maybe dealing with the archers of Anor Londo, there's always something there to make you hate yourself a bit more in this game, just because you know that the mistakes are all on you. The 'Open' world is also a nice change of pace from its PS3 predecessor Demon Souls, and feels atmospherically better than its sequel, Dark Souls II, despite a several flaws such as a 30fps lock.There are many who enjoy a challenge, but even more who are turned off by it. However, with some effort and habit breaking, even an unexperienced gamer would be able to enjoy this game. The game has gone on sale as low as 5 USD, but it is well worth the full 20 USD price.			"

												*Refunded*It's not a bad game... I am just bad at it. So bad in fact that it is not even remotely fun for me. I basically would die, learn the strat a bit more, die again, learn the strat a bit better just to die again. I understand this is a game of pefect timing and masterful skill, I just apparently lack either. I AM NOT SAYING DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. I am just saying I personally did not enjoy the trial and error formula. I actually see the value and complexity to a game like this. It simply isn't for me. I am actually going to still give this a thumbs up, not because I enjoyed it but rather because I respect what the game accomplishes. Tight gameplay, a smart story, a beautiful atmosphere and of course a good challenge. Long story short if you like trial and error games that offer a high ammount of reward/accomplishment then you will likely love this. If you are looking for something you can pick up and play through with no hiccups then try something else.-Casey			"

Don't get too attached to any one weapon; Many enemies have resistances and weaknesses to exploit.4.) Kalameet is a fatty.5.) Praise the Sun!26.) Sometimes, walking away from one boss fight that's killing you and cleansing your palate by visiting another boss who wants to kill you can make you appreciate the first boss more. Some of the 26 boss fights are optional, but that's just Dark Souls being coy; it knows you want to get the whole set.216.) …I wasn't prepared to die that many times…Edit: Turns out I missed a secret boss.

My experience on Day 1  - This should help you decide if you want to play!Today I played my first my first 5 or so hours of the game and I have to say.. it was a great experience. I purchased the game on the idea of a challenge and a skill cap that I would want to pop but that proves to be harder than I first thought.A friend starts talking to me on steam just as I see the first boss and tells me the joy that can come from Dark Souls. I listen and I quickly see what the game has to offer and I also notice that my friend will be my mentor through this experience. After just under 10 lives I manage to kill the first boss and arive at Lordan. After speaking to a guy who seems to know more about myself than I do, I realise that the goal of the game is to reach a destination of some sort.I then go forward and find that I must defeat pairs of skeletons... who are overpowerd and after 10 or so lives I realise I need to do something different. I go down there and rush.. without even looking at the skeletons and see a shield. I die quickly after and the go back down to look for other items. By now I have realised how the soul system of the game works and that if I die I must retreve my souls from the spot I have died. I level up my dexterity because that seems to be what I need and go for many more runs with each life teaching my more about the combat of the game.I start to give up alittle bit but then my guide (friend) replys after being afk. My question is ""Am I doing something wrong"" and proceed to tell him about the skeletons. He then replys with a quick tip, ""Try seeking a plan B route"". It hits me. I have been going the wrong direction the whole time. I quickly find a stair route that have much weaker enemies in it. My new weakness... grouped up enemies that attack shortly after one another while you are downed and/or recovering. Quickly I begin to realise that they must be seperated and try just that.2 Hours pass and countless lives go along with them. Keeping calm and learning from my mistakes and such. Finally I get to a tower-ish area, do you go up or down? I go up and walk along a bridge area. BOOM, a boss... much to powerful for my equipment and I. So I die... go back and choose to go down and am met with a boss. You know what happened... don't you?!~Day 1 - This game... its hard to believe it was made so long ago for something that wants to challenge you in such a way... and I love it!			"

												At this point you have probably already heard of this game, but i want to write review for this game just because it deserves it.Game relies on your skills ( reflex, timing and good execution of your plan if any), this game doesn't hold your hand at all which is pleasant change.Best boss fights if i dare to say so myself, they are huge, interesting and never same, all bosses are unique, well designed and just freaking amazing.I would highly recommend this game to you if you are bored of games, yes that's a thing and it happens and game like this which is quite different from usual ones might be just the thing you need.Only thing i disliked was online, it did worked at times but now always, i had to use 3rd party programs to improve online, and Dark Souls has amazing community, didn't have any summon signs but found help through forums.Amazing game, amazing community, lore of course and skill.Git Gud and Praise the Sun.

												£20 for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition? That's what I thought while shopping in Asda one day, and so I picked up the phsyical edition of the game. After installing Microsft's DRM service, Games for Windows Live, and discovering the game didn't want to link to my Steam account, I started playing. While Dark Souls is an incredibly fun game, I just can't recommend it while it still has Games for Window's Live attached to it. After the service managed to delete my account, meaning I couldn't save my game, I decided to buy it on Steam in the sales so as to be able to actually have a save file. And guess what? The game still makes me use GfWL, and now the service is refusing to let me log in at all - meaning it will be impossible to ever save my game. Unless this is fixed, I'm going to have to wait until June 2014 (when Live is shut down - hurrah) before I can play a game I've bought twice. This is incredibly disappointing.			"

												PRAISE THE SUN!If only I could be so grossly incandescent!Jolly co-operation!^^These quotes will be part of your life forever.The Demon's Souls and Dark Souls games are my favorite series this gen. They changed the way I look at ARPGs with the fantastic combat and the open worlds you can play within. The combat is just amazing with every weapon having different mechanics and animations so you can try tons of different styles of  gameplay from big swords to daggers to dual wielding to being a pokey turtle with a spear and giant shield.  Not just melee, but Pyromancy, Sorcery, and Miracles are available too with their wands and gloves and can all be used by every player if your skills are good enough. Don't forget to use the items too for some fun ways of attackign enemies like poison arrows and darts. This game is an RPG with a story that isn't spoon fed to you. This series tells a story through item descriptions and other obscure places. It is a world of lore that is found through reading items and very few cutscenes. You awaken in this world and everyone is just as crazy as you will feel. You upgrade your levels by collecting souls to increase your attributes, which allow you to wield more weapons and cast different magics. STamina is important. Very important. Don't skimp on it. This series introduced a fascinating online mechanic. While I like the messages and the blood stains more in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls still has them. Messages can be left from other players that can either help, or trick you into a death. These are all pre-written messages and you choose from a list for obvious reasons. Blood stains allow you to view how other explorers have died! Sometimes these are hilarious.The big online aspect , however is the PvP and the co-op it provides. If you have used Humanity to get into human form you can be INVADED by other players on the server at any time as long as you have not killed the area boss. ""XXXXXX Has Invaded ....."" starts the heart pumping immediately as you play cat and mouse while you search each other out. Ultimately one of you finds the other with a sneak attack, or you just make a friendly bow and start to circle each other for a one on one fight to the death! You can even have summoned phantoms help you out if you find their summon signs first to fell these invaders.The Co-op aspect works like the messages where summon signs are placed upon the ground and you can summon Blue Phantoms (other players) to help you through the area and ultimately defeat the boss. Dark Souls also introduced Covenants, which allow you to join mysterious groups within the world. Each group has different benefits for members. They will put you in a bullseye for more invaders, allow you to team up easier for co-op with friendly players, give you extra powers, and many more things. Several of these are available and can be joined when found and leaving another Covenant. While the online aspects are intriguing this game is at its heart a single player game. One that can be played with the threat of invasions by staying in Human form, or completely alone by playing offline, or as a Hollow. This game isn't a PvP game, while many will try to make it one. This edition does offer an Arena, however with the new DLC to play PvP as much as you want without having to search for players to invade in the world itself. The main way to play this is to think of it as a single player game with online elements. These online elements add to the difficulty as there is no AI that can give you the challenge that a human player can. These invasions are to put a kink in your exploration and make the world even more dangerous.The PC port graphically isn't the greatest, however. Most players have downloaded the mod named DSFix (search google) to help with some of the technical aspects of the game. Dark Souls has its own Nexus site and is completely compatible with the Nexus Mod Manager like the Elder Scrolls and Fallout games have, but these are mostly cosmetic as adding anythign that could impact other players would be illegal for an online experience. A bunch of other graphical upgrades are available as well as the ability to replace the gamepad buttons like to PS3 buttons for those of us that use a PS3 controller, and many other controller buttons are there too for peopel that like Logitech.This series is one that you should not miss. If you have a Playstation 3 try getting and playing Demon's Souls first, however as this has changed some of the gameplay a bit. My best surprise in gaming ever was Demon's Souls buying it on a whim the first week it came out. It is an epic adventure. I believe that the servers are actually still Live as well so you should be able to play online last I checked.			"

												Dark Souls is like a love/hate relationship.When I started playing it, I found it rather quite stressful and hopeless. This was not only the beginning of my Dark Souls adventure but also the beginning playing with a xbox controller so of course I had to get used to that too.I died countless of times in the very first area and the very first boss ""The Asylum Demon"" was a really pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to defeat.I did kill the boss after many attempts and reached the second area ""Firelink Shrine"". This was the part were I completely lost all my hope since small enemies like skeletons and hollows were able to kill me pretty easily. Then I decided to give up, because I felt stuck and lost in this universe. Therefore I quit the game for a few mounths.Then a friend of mine started to suggest that I should go on with Dark Souls. My friend had an interest in Dark Souls because he watched Dark Souls 3 videos and he new that I used to play Dark souls 1.With his help by my side I learned the Dark Souls basics and gave me advice in boss fights or other situations. This boost of hope restored my power of will to continue and as I played the game, my character became stronger and I had an actual clue of what I was doing.I finally managed to beat the game and all the bosses after many ours of victorious happiness and miserable defeats.As long as you ""git gud"" and ""praise the sun"", you can enjoy this game.

												Dark Souls™: Prepare To Spend 3 Hours Modding And Troubleshooting Errors To Make It A Decent Port™ EditionBut after that, this game is delicious. It feels like the developers have been isolated from society for several years while making this game, and never had any idea of the standards that have been set in modern game development.The standards where button mashing is always a legitimate option, where the player's hand is held with constant instruction and navigational aid (even to the point where games play themselves), where there is no consequence for dying.This game is oblivious to all of that. The combat is extremely satisfying; complex and risky, without being overly convoluted. Button mashing WILL get you killed right away. Every weapon has its own moveset, handling, and attributes. You will die a lot. Success comes from learning the mechanics, attack animations, enemy AI, physics, and reasons behind your mistakes. It becomes the most fun thing ever and oh mah gawwwwd the boss designs are wicked intense, and environments are gorgeous and seamlessly intertwined. It's an open world where you can get lost and discover places ""early"", but there is no such thing as being underleveled. Your level means nothing, and you can complete many areas whether you upped your damage or not. It's all about what you can handle.I give this a Yes out of 10 rating. play play play play play play play play			"

I'm hoping to catch some of the people that are coming from Dark Souls 3If you're thinking about buying this game, I say go for it, but there are a few things you should know. This game is sitting on the edge of unplayable without Durante's DSfix /http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/? (API MOD) The combat is slower, especially if you start the game with full armor. It's not nearly as pretty as Dark Souls III, even with every mod out there.This game was released in 2011, and it was highly innovative for that time, much like DS3 or Bloodborne is today.Just keep in mind that you're playing a piece of Fromsoftware history, and with that, your expectations should be in the right place.The lore is just as deep, the items are just as confusing, and the bosses are just as daunting. I think I am finally retiring from this game now, and at the end of this week I will be flying to Japan to give Miyazaki the blowie he deserves.			"

												This is the game guys. Along with its predecessor Demon's Souls this game has become my favorite game of all time and even rivals games like The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Metal Gear Solid, Okami and Mass Effect. Games that I hold dearly in my heart because they are special to me. If you have played Demon's Souls you will feel right at home. Like Demon's Souls, Dark Souls is an incredibly rewarding game.The story and lore is fascinating and deep even though the game is not very good at telling you these things.The combat in this game is top notch and the vast amount of unique weapons, armour and spells give you plenty opportunities to experiment with them and pick the one you like the most.I wouldn't say that Dark Souls is a hard game. It just doesn't hold your hand like most games do today and I think it is a nice nod to the unforgiving NES/SNES era. The difficulty of this game lies in the skill of the player. Also to get the best experience out of this game. Play this game with no guide or anything whatsoever.Now you may ask yourself, does this games have flaws? Yes, it does. The PC version has a large amount of framedrops (You will especially notice this if you have played the console version too), online matchmaking could be done better and a controller is almost required to play this game smoothly.But do these flaws stop me from enjoying this game? HELL NO! I say go get this game if you want a deep action RPG/dungeon crawler that will entertain you for hours.Praise The Sun, Sunbros!!  \o/			"

												Before anyone jumps down my throat, let me say this.  The difficulty of the game was NOT the reason for the thumbs down.  yes it is hard and it is really damn annoying at times, but it is extremely rewarding to finally make it through whatever boss or section of a map that you are playing.   The reason that I give it a thumbs down is largely because of how bad of a port the game was.   The graphics could have been enhanced more but they were good enough to get the job done, so that's a very very minor reason.   The issue with the port was the learning curve on what keys from the Xbox controller were corresponded to the keys on the computer.   I tried so hard to figure it out and got most of the things down but it was so frustrating.   But the worse part, was the mouse.  I used mods to fix it but it kept turning at 90deg turns and made it annoying to stay still.   And then finally, the ""focus on enemy"" feature, whatever it was called, was so bad because even when you would focus on one enemy, your mouse would grab another one and thus leave you wide open and in this game, that can cost you dearly. If they only cared enough to have changed the controls (especially the on screen buttons -.- then it would have been better to play, but they didn't.   I think this is better to just play on the console, rather than the PC.TL;DR  The game itself, is great, although tough, but the PC version of is a really bad port  UNLESS you use controller, which makes it much much easier to play.   As for KB&M users, use the mods made by players, or just get a controller.			"

												As the ""chosen undead"" you embark, spurred by a prophecy, on a pilgrimage that'll see you traverse the whole world of Lordran and ultimately decide its fate: it'll be a long, arduous journey that'll test the player character- and you as the player- several times.I agree with the notion that Dark Souls can be considered a flawed gem: it won't be for everyone, there's some questionable design decisions and it feels a bit clunky at times but when everything clicks the game is very fun and extremely rewarding.PROS:-when modded it looks quite nice considering its age-great soundtrack and sound design-a sprawling, interesting world to explore with some truly nice vistas-great combat system rewards skill, strategy and patience-the difficulty might be frustrating at times, but gives a great sense of progression as you slowly become able to tackle stronger foes and is immensely rewarding once you beat a difficult area or boss-bosses and minibosses are, for the most part, tense and engaging affairs: most bosses are also quite menacing due to their size and/ or art style-tons of different weapons, armours and spells to suit basically any playstyle-the multiplayer aspects are interesting, it's fun to see player ghosts going around their business and die: invasions can be a bit annoying at times but there's no denying they're fun and keep you on edge-very long, expect around 40/ 50 hours, plus you get DLC and New Game Plus modesNEUTRAL:-story is a tad muddy overall and its easy to get confused if you don't examine objects or talk to missable NPC (some of which can be missed)-inventory/ stats screens work but feel cumbersomeCONS:-blurry, muddy graphics when unmodded: also lacks most graphical options-problematic camera can really get in the way and lead to unfair deaths-some drawn-out sequences with no bonfires can get aggravating-if you die to a boss having to either clear the whole path to it(or try to run through mobs to quickly reach it again) simply gets dull -the lack of handholding and tutorials, apart from very basic ones, can leave new players stumped on what to do, how to spend their points and what build to aim for


Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition 
A Screenshot of Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition
By: stranger1982




Dark Souls will be intimidating for most when you start, heck it took me a few tries to just get to grips with combat against basic enemies: and the first bosses were messy affairs where I just ran around trying to roll/ parry just to be cut down in two hits. But persevering in the face of hardships yields results soon enough nad going back to a boss the next day only to beat it on the first try gives an huge sense of accomplishment. And that's really the whole game in a nutshell, bashing your face against difficult zones, strong enemies and huge bosses to eventually come out victorious once you get the hang of it.The difficulty that made the series famous sadly stems, in part, from the camera: it works decently most of the time but while fighting huge bosses/ mobs or traversing cramped spaces it can act up badly: and when it does you might not see an hit coming or simply become disoriented and die with little to no way to react. A few encounters are also designed in a purposedly cheap way...have to traverse a thin strip of stone over an huge chasm? We'll add ranged mobs just to ensure you might die a cheap death. These encounters feel outright annoying rather than challenging...same goes for having to walk over invisible platforms or fighting in almost pitch darkness, I did it and eventually made it but I felt relief rather than accomplishment in doing so.But even with all its flaws the game is a memorable experience, for me it was about going against overwhelming odds and persevering even in the face of multiple defeats: to try until you succeed, to know that there's always a way to come out on top, eventually. And it was also a story about sacrifice both in its plot and the actual game mechanics.Is this a game for you? Maybe, maybe not...it's not as difficult as certain people make it out to be (and if you're really frustrated or scared to tackle it, just read a guide to have a slightly easier experience) but it surely demands quite a bit of skill and lots of concentration to go through. And even if you can't beat it I feel even just a few hours with the game could be worth it even just for the cathartic experience it's able to provide.			"

												Unmatched Difficulty!/ Navigate a labyrinth of FAQs and forums as you take on the ultimate test of patience in trying to get your game to launch./ Engage in tireless trial and error as you attempt to smooth out your framerate and improve graphics and performance with 3rd-party mods./ Measure the true extent of your PC elitism upon realizing just how trashy the keyboard & mouse controls are.Hardcore Role-playing/Life Simulation!/ Select a class, meticulously customize your appearance, then play through the game unsatisfied with the final results. In fact, spend 95% of the game looking like your own corpse. Be reminded constantly of your own mortality and question the long-term merits of your purchase decision as you gaze into the lifeless eyes of your broken, decrepit avatar./ Sit at bonfires, refill flasks, wander off, pick fights, lose, black out, reawaken at bonfires... Lordran will help you prepare for your own future with this poorly-disguised alcoholism metaphor./ Shuffle forward like a real-life Mondoshawan as you put on increasingly heavy pieces of armor while believing the added pseudo-protection is actually worth it. Each another burden. Each a regret./ Continously fight the urge to access the wiki for information that will save you from dozens of wasted hours and disastrous mistakes. Go ahead. Go ahead and play God, you weak coward./ Stave off those suicidal thoughts by piecing together the lore and making up your own story as you're stuck fighting in the same area, against the same enemies, for entire sessions or even days.

Don't skip out just because you think it's too hard. You will rage, but it's the good kind of rage. The kind you used to get playing NES games 25 years ago. You will learn from your mistakes, improve and move on.Do yourself a favor. Play this game, die a lot and enjoy every minute of it!			"

												So.. Dark Souls III just came out. And here I was... thinking that I could try Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition again. Although I never really did try it for real before. For some reason it had huge performance issues on my former PC - which was not bad in any regard. Anyway my new high-end PC and the community-patch I've installed made it a smooth ride so far.When Dark Souls II came out I tried it.. and almost immediately ragequitted it. It made me think that I would never ever like a Dark Souls-title. Well.. I was so wrong. It took Dark Souls 1 just a few hours to hook me and really get me into it. I found myself on several occasions during the last few days feeling this urge and thought: ""I want to play more Dark Souls... I want to get into the next area, find another cool weapon, fight the next boss and more..."" It really took me by surprise that a game - I thought I would hate & ragequitt after the first few deaths - could get me so invested and leave me with a desire for more. I want to experience more of this world, it's NPCs and often harsh and unforgiving fights.It's just an awesome feeling to backstab, plunge attack or parry & counterattack an enemy!			"

												It's certainly novel for a game's subtitle to boast of your impending slaughter, but Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is unusual in most respects. Its combat is abnormally precise, its narrative is largely embedded within optional NPC interactions, and its multiplayer features are unconventional and initially largely hidden. While the PC version is a shabby port, there is simply no other action RPG out there like Dark Souls, which is so good that it adversely affected my opinion of how all previous RPGs handled combat. However, I must start out with a warning: the PC port is a disappointing wasted opportunity to technically improve on the console version of Dark Souls, and it lacks many features you probably expect as standard. The resolution is locked at 1280x720 (aka 720p), the framerate is locked at 30fps, and there are no high resolution textures. There's a mouse & keyboard control option, but control is so bad that it's not practical, so you'll definitely want a gamepad to play. Fortunately, there's a must-have unofficial patch available that improves the rendering resolution. With it, everything looks much crisper, although you're stuck with low-resolution textures.That said, Dark Souls is still an amazing game. There's no hand-holding - to succeed, you need to invest time diligently exploring, learning the combat system, and developing your skills to overcome challenges. The open-world design makes it likely that you'll wander into high-level areas that'll mercilessly slap some perspective into your character. It's a tough, but fair experience. Deaths aren't cheap, but success needs to be well earned. Dark Souls – likes it predecessor – is a third-person dungeon crawl at its core. In the almost overbearingly gloomy realm of Lordran, a sizeable open-world that you’ll explore high and low, threats loom just about anywhere you look. From a few established hubs in the world, you’ll expand outward, constantly facing adversity in the endless gnarled faces of ever-dangerous creatures that stand between you and ending the calamotous period called the Age of Fire…or, if the tone of the world sucks you under, to usher in a different calamity entirely. The game’s plot is purposely minimalistic and tells its story through the limitations of its sparsely populated world. Like most everything else in the game, the flavour of the game’s lore and plot is largely left with the player’s curiousity and interpretation, which suits it just fine. Dark Souls is a game focused squarely on combat that demands precision, smarts, and persistence.Most action-oriented games place you in frenetic fights that move swiftly, and although fluidity is very much a key to success in Dark Souls, the combat here feels weighty and deliberate. Your character’s movements, burdened with heavy armour and weaponry, feel appropriately strained. You can’t make a last minute dodge out of harm’s way or just mash on the attack button, either. Every action in the game is methodical yet extremely powerful if used judiciously and properly. Each blow you land and fatal swipe you dodge is the result of skilled observation and timing, of knowing your characters strengths and limits and exploiting each to the fullest. Know your character and pull your punches wisely, and you’ll slay the toughest of foes. Attack wildly and evade flippantly, and you’ll soon find your enemies taking advantage of your every misstep.Death is swift and common in Dark Souls, though it’s never an end. In fact, your character will likely be dead – or “hollowed” – for much of your play time, complete with a decayed and eyeless face. Each time you die, you’ll lose all of the souls you accrued from enemies – which serve as both experience points to upgrade your stats and currency to purchase items – and respawn at the last bonfire you visited, which serve as sigh-relieving points of rest in the game world. Bonfires refill your stock of estus flasks – the game’s healing item – as well as recharge uses of your spells. Yet even these points of safety come with a catch; use a bonfire, and all enemies excepting bosses respawn, ready to make an attempt on your life once more.The game’s death mechanics also introduce yet another unique aspect to Dark Souls – the importance and privelige of being alive. Although your character handles the same way no matter their state, using valuable Humanity items at a bonfire to turn your character back into a living being opens up a ton of online connectivity features. Although you can’t play Dark Souls in a multiplayer setting or set up matchmaking with your friends, each individual player does slightly connect to all others. You may see ghostly images of other players appear around you, real-time feed of where they are and what they’re doing in their own game. When you’re alive, you can find and use items to summon players into your game temporarily, using them to help you clear more difficult sections. Ultimately, you get out what you put in to Dark Souls. There’s a dizzying amount of nuance and detail in the game’s setting, level design and combat, and it only gets more engrossing as you sink your teeth in further. The more you change up your fighting style and take risks, the more you learn about what makes the enemies tick, and brings possible methods for felling them to the surface. There’s no easing you into play mechanics or tips popping up on screen to give you a hand in Dark Souls. You not only need to take chances and be proactive in your approach to its many challenges, you need to remember everything that works and apply it skillfully. Equipment choices can have more than one impact - heavy armor not only blocks more damage than lighter equipment, it also makes your character less likely to be thrown off balance when hit. Large shields have great stability, which allows your blocks to use less stamina, but light shields allow you to better land devastating ripostes. Some weapons inflict damage dependent upon attributes such as Strength. If you've neglected the attributes that modify weapon damage, you can instead use elemental weapons that don't rely upon attribute modifiers, or chaos weapons that scale with consumable Humanity points. If you find it difficult to get parry timing down, ignore it and use heavy shields for blocking or rely more upon rolling. Enemies and items don't scale in strength as you level, so if you become skilled enough at combat you can complete the storyline and grab the most powerful equipment as a very low-level character. The Prepare to Die Edition also adds three new areas that provide some new insight into the setting's history: a crumbling cityscape, a forest, and an area of the Abyss that's haunted by Humanity ghosts. The cityscape is the only one that impresses, as the others feel too redundant next to the original content, but the new enemies make them worth playing, including some misshapen humanoids with headstalks that can be seen in darkness and some tough stone guardians who slam their hammer so viciously into the ground that yanking them out causes an explosion of turf. The new bosses include the fallen Knight Artorias, a key figure in the lore, and a ferocious Dragon which is so tough that he's an optional fight. All of the new bosses are frenetic and extremely aggressive combatants, making them at least as tough as those in the original areas. One of those original bosses also makes a very welcome reappearance, in a manner that both fits well with established lore and gives a different tone to the original encounter.With its high difficulty, punitive checkpoint system, and trial-and-error gameplay, Dark Souls isn't for everyone. But with the Prepare to Die Edition, PC gamers finally have a version of Dark Souls to call their own, and longtime fans of the game have some new content to work with. Graphical hiccups aside, that makes this port a success.			"

												One of my favourite games of all time.I originally played Dark Souls on the Xbox 360 back in the day and i absolutely hated it. The combat was punishing and i had no idea what most of the items did and i would die over and over again and eventully i said something like ""♥♥♥♥ this!"" and gave up on it.A few weeks later i tried the game again and something just clicked. The combat was still punshing, i still had no idea what most of the items did and i still died over and over again but i learnt that Dark Souls is the kind of game that you have to play by it's rules. Running around trying to be Rambo like you would in any other hack and slash game will do nothing but encourage you to smash your desktop in to little pieces.Pros:- A huge detailed dark fantasy world to explore and die in.- So many different character builds. Do you want to focus on using heavy weapons and pyromancy? You can do that. Want to be a fast moving wizard who can also use a samurai sword? You can do that too. How about a naked man armed only with a broken sword and wooden shield?- Weighty and responsive combat which makes you feel like a badass.- Dozens of cool weapons which all have unique move sets to suit your play style.- Unique online features where you can either choose to help other players or invade their world and ruin their day.- Massive scary, screen filling bosses to get killed by.Cons:- The PC port is hot dog♥♥♥♥♥♥but there are fan made patches which are very easy to find and install.- Blight Town exists. I won't spoil anything but you probably won't like it much either.			"

												Dark Soul is a combat oriented rpg, maybe the best i've ever played.It's a very immersive game, you explore multiple areas in a non-linear order, where you decide helping or killing any npc, it's how an rpg has to be, game is always auto saving, yes you undestood correctly GAME IS ALWAYS AUTOSAVING that means when you run out of arrows, or kill npc's you can't just load previous save game, this itself gives the game lots of replayablility and it's what makes this game so great. Maybe is not a game for everyone but is a game everyone have to play. Is challenging is terms of difficulty, uses and abuses of trial and error, but when you just don't rush, look every corner and go slowly the difficulty decreases, but on bosses... on bosses...

												If you're considering buying Dark Souls, you should ask yourself how much you really appreciate a good challenge. Dark Souls is a game that embraces difficulty, and not in a monotonous grind-y way like Ninja Gaiden or I Wanna Be The Guy. Dark Souls does not spoonfeed you victory like so many modern games: it expects you to learn from your mistakes and hopefully prevent them in the future. Persevering through From Software's epic may seem daunting, especially at the beginning, but if you open yourself to it, Lordran can be a fascinating and emotional place. Dark Souls is packed full of monstrosities and deities alike, and although its numerous bosses are not easily felled, triumphing over them will be one of the most rewarding victories you'll likely ever experience.

The level design allows so many different experiences if you know where to go.+ Fair and satisfying combat, but it requires patience and every input has to be intentional.+ Very fun and well designed bosses (except a few, see below).+ Every level is intricately designed and detailed (except a few, see below).+ Expert enemy placement.+ Fantastic atmosphere that ranges from comfy to nerve racking.+ A great variety of weapons and armor combos.+ Stats and levels offer a lot of play variety.+ The deepest of lore, you just have to put effort into appreciating.+ Excellent voice acting for what little there is.+ The greatest DLC I've ever played in my life. - The second half (after Anor Londo) feels a bit rushed and notably weaker than the first half.- The Demon Ruins and Lost Izalith are absoulte sh*t in every way compared to the rest of the game.- The Duke's Archives are lackluster as well.- Capra Demon boss is too claustrophobic and a lazy way of creating difficulty.- Moonlight Butterfly boss is boring for any melee only character.- Pinwheel boss is laughably easy.- Seath the Scaleless boss is annoying and very shallow that makes you fight with the framerate more than the boss itself, even with DSFix.- Ceaseless Discharge boss is lazy and has a stupid cheese way of beating it.- Demon Firesage boss is literally a reskinned Asylum Demon.- Centipede Demon boss is unfun and an eyesore with all the lava.- Four Kings boss is nothing more than a DPS rush where you can't even dodge some attacks.- Bed of Chaos boss is one of the worst designed bosses in any video game ever. It's like they didn't even playtest it.Other than almost half the game feeling rushed and 9 of the 26 boss battles being either lame or stright up horrible bosses, the game's positives greatly outweigh the negatives, but they should not be glossed over. Still one of my favorite games and even at its worst it's still better than most games released today 8/10.			"

												Dark Souls will be one for the ages to me. This is the kind of game that is completely brutal but rewarding at the same time. I raged, and raged hard at some encounters, because this game holds nothing back, but it forces you to also think on your tactics as you progress through the game. It will give you all the tools you need to get through it, you just need to think and plan accordingly. And they are completely right, the feeling of accomplishment you get upon beating a particularly hard section or encounter is unlike any most games out there can give you. I especially enjoy how big monsters actually FEEL like big monsters, as in, they can easily crush you if you're not careful. It was a thrilling and challenging ride, but I loved it and it is now easily one of my favorite games of all time. Highly replayable as well, there are tons of secrets to find here.Elaborating why I liked this game though, hell, even discussing the minimal detail on this game would actually derail and spoil you the experience, in my honest opinion. This is one of those games you're supposed to pick up and play, while going in completely blind. You'll be shafted many times, count on that, and you'll probably seethe with frustration, but you'll adapt, improve as a player, and maybe even overcome the challenges ahead. This is definitely not a game for everyone though, the difficulty is up there.The port wasn't the best, but I did just fine using an Xbox 360 gamepad and DSFix, an unofficial fix that fixes many of the problems it has - http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix. I was able to go through the game quite well, barring one single crash, and some minor framerate issues here and there. That's better than what any Bethesda RPG can really claim in terms of performance, and I love the hell out of those games too.Bottom line, if you have this game on Steam and didn't play it yet, I URGE you to finish this review, and go install it and play it right now. You may end up loving it or hating it, but either way, you won't come out indifferent to it. Even better, now that Steamworks has finally been implemented, you have no excuse. Go die lots of times, go curse that one boss who keeps kicking your♥♥♥♥♥ it'll all be worth it once you finally manage to beat him down, I promise.Praise the Sun!			"

												In a world where games are designed to give you kind of power fantasy feeling for doing jack squat, this action RPG is unafraid to punch you in the face. With an iron gauntlet. Spiked. Repeatedly. Telling you to toughen up, learn to dodge, block and/or parry, and above all, fight back.But it's fair at that - when you do learn how to block, dodge, fight back, then you truly know you do deserve that power fantasy feeling. Or deserved to die for failing to dodge or misstepping that ledge and plunging into ever so eagerly welcoming embrace of gravity.Come here if you want to know what a game designed ground up to be challenging, but fair, means. As opposed to misnaming♥♥♥♥♥♥easy difficulty as ""normal"" and then making ""hard"" just by halfheartedly upping sponginess and numbers of enemies.Beware though, this game really does not hold your hand in any way and you barely get any pointers what to do or where to go, or what various things mean or do - you may end up needing to do some research on wikis etc.The game has interesting take on multiplayer, creating peer to peer network of game worlds (citing temporal anomalies in game lore) that enables various interactions between players. But that, in terms of PvP, I wouldn't call fair, as the game is min maxer's and twinker's paradise and you *will* get totally funked up by relatively overpowered real human adversaries, which, unlike PvE enemies, will give no room to breathe whatsoever. Unless you become one of them, or play majority of game in ""hollow"" state which doesn't let you summon help but also prevents other players from invading your world to kill you.But yeah that summoning of help, letting willing players help you kill bosses - or trying to help others yourself - is part of multiplayer experience as well, along with getting that feeling of shared struggle, seeing various messages left by others or just their apparitions as they hang out by the bonfire or fight in their own world.. and die.The world design is really great (though I think designers had some fetish towards flying buttresses which suspiciously often feature as the only bridge forward). All in all the world is not too huge, and not too open, but is very interconnected, like a tree becoming a graph, opening up more and more, where completing one segment allows you to open a shortcut to places you already visited. It's always a great feeling, recognizing some place you've already been to, now approaching it from a different side... Or even remembering that this ruin up on the hill you've seen the other day, now you're in it, looking down at the ruins you've been into a few days back. You get this sense of adventure, exploration, cohesive but diverse world, dread, desperation, death, misery, sublime, wonder, having to decide on your own which branch of the world to explore next, until you meet a dead end, temporary or otherwise, or the local boss to defeat (and sense of accomplishment once the deed is done), and then repeat, explore, fight, git gud.Praise the sun!

												This game is literally all about you dieing over and over again until you know what in the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing. It's not as hard as people say but playing through the game for the first time can be really frustrating. This game doesn't hold your hand, but it doesn't try to cut off your wrist either. The story is very vague unless you take the time to dig through every description of every item or if you bother talking to the NPCs. You aren't told where to go but what you must do, its up to you to figure out what works best for you, how much you want to engage in the online play (which on this PC port it takes forever to connect to anyone without the use of mods), and how you wish to take on your enemies as you progress. There are quite a few optional places to go, lots of loot to find, and many enemies to kill along the way. Take your time and absorb all of the information the game throws at you, enjoy your first experience through the game. I recommend playing with a controller as the keyboard and mouse controls are just terrible without mods, if you want to play with a very active online community you should aim for one of the console releases of the game, though there is still a bit of a PC community for this game.

												One of the most brilliant RPGs of recent years, a legitimate heir to Severance: Blade of Darkness[en.wikipedia.org], Gothic (by Piranha Bytes) and Rune. Dark Souls makes you re-evaluate your understanding of gaming process, challenges all your skills and nerves, and gives you a rare sense of deep immersion on that very special and rare scale. Not recommended for casual gamers and kids. World of pain, tortures  and death ahead. And strange sun cults, and demons, and big snakes, and spiders, and skeletons. And Mushrooms. And lots of strange and crazy stuff.  Still, get the game and play it already! It's a rare gem you're missing. And remember - it's only possible to learn through death. TLDR: 10/10 brilliant\О/			"

												What is the best part about playing a video game? Is it the thrill of watching the visual effects of a plane crash through a building and the amazement of the graphical destruction caused by the building crashing down to pieces? Is it the Hollywood style action sequences which keep the adrenaline rush going till you eventually want to jump out from the window to try and catch that ledge? Is it the thrill of racing or playing in a football game which one might not be able to achieve in real life? All of these can qualify as perfectly valid reasons for playing video games. But for me, they’re a bit too superficial. My reasons for playing games are much more basic. For me, its all about failing and trying again to correct myself. The possibility of death and the chance of life after it really intrigue me. I love a challenge, and i love to be rewarded for playing well and punished for being stupid. And in that regard, i feel Dark Souls is one of the best games i’ve ever played.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: FromSoftwarePublishers: Bandai Namco Entertainment Initial release: Aug 2012Genre: Action, RPG, Dark#Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationI really like this game. It's punishing but boy is it rewarding. I never played Demon Souls so this is my first ""Souls"" experience. (Lets just pretend the GFWL and DSfix stuff never happened, it runs great) Going through this blind the first time, it was literally one of the most nerve racking and scary games I've ever played (scary in the sense of losing everything you've earned thus far in a single instance.) What I really enjoyed about it was that it feels similar to how rogue-likes are played but within a over-arching game. Every death you learn something new. The game never feels like it cheating you. It's always telling you to be more patient, more cautious and punishing you when you fail to heed to the lessons you hopefully learned. The in depth lore that has to be searched for and interpreted has pros and cons. I personally found  the digging to be well worth it. You could say that it could use a minimap but I would argue that having to remember the maps, item locations, and enemy traps are what gives it the essence of ""Souls"".I continue to mess around and play with diffirent character builds. Very satisfying experience.Follow my curation for more "

												I was particularly stressed out because of work, exams at uni and issues in my personal life when I started to play this game, so this was my little island of peace where I could calm my nerves after a long day... I don't understand what's the big fuss with this game, I've only broken 2 keyboards, a table and my arm in outbursts of rage.Ok, jokes aside I've bought this game in 2014, played it for 15 minutes, got killed by the Asylum Demon, uninstalled the it and I didn't touch it for 2 years. I'm not sure why... usually I'm not a whiny little b...ch when it comes to a challange in games but I gave it another shot a few weeks ago and oh boy... I was an idiot back then. I probably still am but that's another thing.This game is an absolute beast! The scenery is diverse and jaw-dropping even by today's standards (at least for me), the gameplay gives a solid challange, and the boss fights are epic. Yes, it's hard, yes, you'll die a 1000 times (I sure did) but as you play more you'll get better and the joy that you feel when you kick a boss'♥♥♥♥♥after failing so many times will compensate you for the pain/anger/despair etc that you've felt after every failed attempt.The only downside for me was the ""lack of story""... I'm a sucker for a great plot in games (normally for me the story matters the most) but here It seemed like the story is not an organic part of the game, maybe I just didn't pay enough attention but it was pretty hazy and uninteresting to me. The other thing that I missed was a badass soundtrack... especially at bosses. There are a few good scores but for most of the time it's pretty forgettable. I had to put in some rock songs during boss fights to get myself in a pumped-up state in order to beat the s..t out of them.Overall; the game is fun/hard like hell and I'll definitely pick up the sequels as soon as I can!

												This was it, the game that ruined multiplayer for me forever.Playing through Dark Souls with a friend was one of the most rewarding and greatest experiences I've ever had in a video game. And since that time, no game has even come close to delivering such an addictive story and fun time. I've been given suggestions, Borderlands 2, Gears of War, Torchlight II, but none can compare. Unfortunately the same holds true for Dark Souls 2, which did not deliver as enchanting a story as it's precurser.  The truth is, this game was just too good. And I feel robbed of my appreciation of other games because of the standard this game has set for me.Not but really, this games amazing, go buy it and play it. Now.			"

A blaze of fire carpeted the path from the door, and seconds later, the wooden obstacle was blown from its hinges. The Legend had arrived.Without even breaking a sweat, Giantdad grabbed the hacker by the head in mid-swing, twisting him so he looked at the face of No-Mercy right in the eyes.""Wt rings u gt, bicth?"" it asked, without really caring to hear the answer.The hacker squirmed under the intense grip, swinging his Crystal Greatsword madly. ""You only live once, ♥♥♥♥♥,"" it continued, impaling the hacker with its Chaoshander +5. ""Unless you're a Legend.""Then, the Legend falcon-punched the hacker, slicing his head from his shoulders in less than a second. Giantdad surveyed the scene, pleased with his work, and began to walk away.Then, as if forgetting something, it turned back around, and strode up to one of the only still-functional cameras in the room, and held his arms out wide in a gesture that it could pull off successfully. Finally, it whispered something so powerful, one would need an oscilloscope to appreciate it properly.""THE LEGEND NEVER DIES!""			"

												Dark Souls is easily one of my favorite games ever made. The gameplay is sophisticated, but it isn't too complicated once you understand the stats and what they mean. Controls are tight, and everything works as it should. The world is deep and rich with an interesting lore that isn't shoved in your face. You basically have to read item descriptions and pay close attention if you really want to understand the world From has crafted. Or you can just do what normal people do and kill stuff and move on. The story of the game is very implicit, but the direction is clear if you talk to NPCs. Multiplayer is a big part of the game, with coop existing by summoning friendly phantoms to assist you in your world. There is also Player vs. Player, which is the main draw for me, and it's fantastic aside from the occasional lag and balancing issues. One of the main problems with the game was that it used Games for Windows Live, but that's gone now and the multiplayer is better than ever. The PC Port is just god awful though. It's locked to a low resolution and framerate and the keyboard controls seem to have been designed by a monkey with half a brain. This is all fixed by Durante's mod DSFix, which is very easily installed. Once everything works as it should, the multiplayer of this game is phenomenal. The game has a reputation for being brutally difficult and unfair, but that's not really true. The game's difficulty comes from its punishing nature. If you make a mistake, you're gonna get messed up. Playing carefully is the best way forward (read: get good). Nothing about the game is intrinsically unfair aside from gravity being overpowered.The community in this game is fantastic as well, but it has its fair share of tryhards that will send hatemail at the slightest infraction of their self-imposed moral code. I've gotten death threats for not bowing before a fight before. You learn to move past these people, and you find some seriously funny and dedicated people that make this game's community great. Youtubers like VaatiVidya, Iron Pineapple, and formerly OnlyAfro (Rest in Peace good Afro) make pretty great videos that also add to the community of the game.In summation, this game is a must-play for anyone that doesn't mind fixing a small amount of issues. The game is punishing, but never unfair and the multiplayer is to die for. Get it? Also, Git Gud  "

												At times I found myself at my wit's end, hours of endless failures had taken it's toll on me, I was about to give up on this game and consider it a waste of money.Then eventually I got past GFWL and I could play the game. It's pretty good.			"

												Welcome to dark souls, prepare to die. This will be a review of the full experience including DLCs. You play by freely walking around in third person with full jumping abilitys, even over low railings and with them often..well death. Enemies will have a certain aggro range and once you reach this they approach you, you hit the enemy by having them be where your attack lands, akin to Skyrim for comparison, only third person.Dark souls adds a lock-on mechanic on top of this, meaning you then permanently aim at the enemy when using it, allowing you to control where you attacks are directed to, as well as making dodging a lot easyer by being able to focus where ""away"" is.In its essence dark souls is like other action RPGs but it doesn't hold your hand or mess around. There is no map, dying makes you lose a decent chunk of progress, ""savepoints"" are few in between (but you can quit and come back anywhere) and saving brings back all enemies and most importantly all enemies are OP and kill you in barely any time. This is mostly fair though once you get used to the fact that you dont slay mass amounts of enemies and level up but rather fight for dear life constantly. And pretty much all enemies are just a matter of skill, if you master the controls and learn their moveset you will barely take any hits anymore and thus the fact that you die so easyly will matter less. Speaking of controls, for the love of god do this with a controller, even on pc, it makes things a lot more managable. Also they are a bit clunky, which gets improved upon with later parts, for example you can only dodge in 4 directions, even though often you would have needed a couple more.Mastering is easyer said than done though, especially when you choose to fight the enemy close up, you will have to dodge every attack perfectly and in the right direction, know when to attack what to block etc. etc. and the game will punish mistakes by allowing the enemies powerful strikes to get you. This is where all the difficulty comes from, dodged too early twice? Often this means you are dead. This is actually even part of the charm, so a giant monstrosity successfully smacks you with a club, well you should be dead. And look at that you are. It makes you get to learn how enemies behave and to respect them. Once you are done with this you will probably never forget any of the bosses and most of the enemies will remain with you forever, their moveset, how to fight them. And that's not something most slightly more greyish orcs in other games can claim.And o boy the enemy design together with the places you find them in is probably the games strongest point, it makes monstrosities look truly twisted and evil, dragons and giants fearsome and the enemies always fit the locations, knights in castles, killershrooms in forrests, and have a reason for being where they are what they are as well as for trying to kill you. Allthough speaking of looks the game looks even older than it is, obviously no modern standard but I'd say still good enough to be very enjoyable.And once you succeed, once you get into the flow, it feels incredibly rewarding, because all together this means said giant looks like it will just rolfstomp you, and it WILL stomp you so you take all of your skill and roll away right as his giant weapon approaches and attack in the moment of breath his opening leaves for you until you have finally worn him down to death. It just feels like a ""realistic"" boss fight would and should play out.Also the game usually hints at danger, even though it is subtle, for example with burnt corpses, animating you to run for your life.Now a couple of difficulties are unneccesary though. For example as I said there is no map and of course that would break the immersion to a certain degree but you get so damn lost so easyly and until very late in the game you always will have to find your way by foot no fast travel and often not even obvious paths. I believe having a largely reduced map to at least help you out a little would help so much.The cameraangle can also sometimes be your downfall, luckily though this isnt common.And the worst part about the game in my opinion is a lack of guidance about what to do. Again obviously there is reasons not to hold hands and give door by door directions, however, let me just give you an example:right after the tutorial you are at a crossroads. there is many paths to choose and all look like a neat adventure. WRONG all but one of them kill you and there is no real way for you to know except for kind of not being able to beat the enemies and constantly dying. But it is dark souls, perhaps you just need to improve! No, just no, you are running against an impossible wall and dont even know it yet. This goes further with how ridicoulous the things you need to do to advance get. It is basically talk to NPC A then go back get item B at location C and then and ONLY then you can advance in a place that is nowhere near any of this and seems to have absolutely nothing to do with any of it. This is some hold the red orb and jump in a tornado type of how are you supposed to know that.Also some of the bosses are just absolutely hard even for Darksouls standards, requiring pitch perfect reactions even more than other enemies and coming at you with incredible ferocity, basically forcing you into a 3 minute cycle of perfection or death. Most of these are optional though. There is actually a lot of extra content, new enemies places bosses etc. both via DLC and just in the game in general for that extra touch of everything that makes Dark souls what it is.FInally the story: it's complicated. Aside from an absolutely amazing introduction there is no cutscenes to establish anything and while you know your general world and goal kinda, there is such an incredible hidden amount of lore. Like you kill a boss and its eh whatever, though it looked neat, but in reality this was person X responsible for event Y and major player in the history of the world, but you will never know that, because tidbits are hidden in item descriptions of all places, NPC dialogs and most importantly piecing together piece by piece and theorizing. Oh and the music is pretty neat, subtle, underlining the emotion rather than setting it and just great tracks.A final key note: multiplayer. At this very moment a revival event is happening and you can actually find people again but thats like once a year and only a few days. At all others times there is a chance you are literally the only person in the game and this kills a lot of gameplay, though not key experiences they are a defining part of what makes this game. For example in certain areas of the game another player could choose to jump into your world to fight you, because things arent already hard enough. Or the fact that there is a certain selection of texts applyable anywhere in the world for all to see. (and this is usually used to write ""treasure"" at the edge of a cliff) there is ""covenants"" basically factions in the game with their own items places rewards concepts etc and there is a LOT of them. All pretty much useless without multiplayer. So if you check this game out see when the next revival event is and then see how the entire experience changes.Tl:DR:amazing setting and design, brutally complicated, buy if you love piecing together a great story fantasy action RPGs, fast reaction based challenges.Got eaten alive by a lootbox 10/10			"

My Personal Score: 4.5/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: This is a very unoptimized port. Visit the PCGW page before you click the purchase button.DLC: None. Prepare To Die Edition comes packaged with the Artorias of the Abyss DLC from the consoles.Microtransactions: None.Dark Souls is a very difficult game, yet my experience with it can only be described as gratifying. It consistently challenged me and appropriately rewarded my efforts for taking risks, never treating me like a child that requires constant hand-holding, but as an adult who can assess and adapt to the situation at hand. The game forced me to be patient and calculating, testing my limits, and mocking everything that I knew about games, but all of the challenges that I came across were worth it in the end because it gave me that satisfying sigh that one gets after overcoming an obstacle which kept you in place for minutes - even hours - on end. It will be jarring at first, but if you're prepared to die (a lot) and willing to take challenges which the modern gamer would quickly deem intolerable, I'm sure you'll be rewarded with the same satisfaction that Dark Souls gave its players.And there you have it.

												An excellent and highly deadly way to waste your life. But seriously, if you're the sort of person who gets frustrated by dying a lot, or likes game mechanics explained to you this game is -not- for you. Also, the storyline appears quite late in the game and is somewhat hard decipher, so heads up if you can't deal with vague plotlines.			"

												I love Dark Souls old school style when it comes to difficulty. They don't hold your hand by giving you tutorials, practice runs, etc. 10/10 and 1 of my top 10 favorite games. Yes, it's a really hard game but that's what makes it so awesome! It gives you that sense of accomplishment when you do manage to beat that boss, clear that area or whatever the game throws at you.Edit: This game is a ""bad"" console port so I highly recommend that you get DSFix to get the best PC experience. You can find it on Nexus. Edit 2: The 60 FPS unlocker in the .ini file for DSFix is a little wonky. It can lead to issues with the games engine like falling through the world or getting stuck while sitting at a bonfire.Don't forget to read the desription!!! DSFix Download[www.nexusmods.com] "

												+Cool art design and lore that goes together.+Good combat.Slow and steady gameplay. Helps you focus to the fights and think before acting.+Good level design.+Nice enemy&boss variety.+Challenging but not unfair. It's not trial&error but rather being careful and patient enough to avoid mistakes. And trying to learn from your mistakes if you failed.o PVP and Co-op are features but they're not polished at all.o The lore is there but it is too subtle. I wouldn't mind at least some dialogues from all those characters you talk to.o The shields are too good. If you can't use them you're bad and if you have a better shield you're better.o Backstabs are too powerful. But it is not like the game is easy. You don't have to abuse it if you don't want to but this will not stop the game from killing you. A perfectly balanced game would make a dull game anyway so why not.- The port is beyond bad. It is dreadful. The resolution is low, fps drops, keyboard&mouse support is bad, you can't play with your friends. You gotta find some mods to fix those issues and they don't fix them completely. (There are mods for resolution and connectivity with your friends. FPS is still an issue and don't know about a keyboard mod.)- Netcode sucks for PVP, get backstabbed from front.- Some builds are not viable at all. You can choose to be a sorcerer but it is really easier to just go strength.- There are times where you will be frustrated because of bad AI, a weird platform that you can't stand on. But the game is about observing before acting and learning from your mistakes so it is not that bad.This game is hardly perfect, but it is a game. It let's you do your thing, find your way through challenges, it does not hold your hand. Like a game should do. This game is all about the game and nothing more. It knows what it is, it does not pretend to be a good PVP experience or a Co-op game. You have to go out of your way to use those features anyway. The good part is: This is a difficult game right? So You don't feel guilty when you can abuse the game, use your items, upgrade them, try magic, try ranged battle min/max. It is fun when you try to find your way around the game. The game is your enemy, you beat it as it beats you, but you still love it.This game is perfect in its imperfections. There are good builds, bad builds, good items, bad items, good bosses, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies, and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But the joy you get from prevailing after all, that is a treasure.			"

												Dark souls, My favorite game, my favorite series. I own 5 copies of this game. Why you ask? well Ill tell you. Demon souls started this new genre. Its an action rpg yes. But its more than that. It is something so new to the gaming world that was desprately needed. A game that you actually playSo many games now hold your hand so much that you are not even really playing the game, you are just clicking a series of actions to keep the game progressing. There are not many games that actually require you to learn the world, the system, the enemies and Much, Much more. Dark souls just does that. it throws you into this unknown world with nothing more that a few scribbled notes on the ground to get you started. Has you killed over and over within 2 minutes of the game, just to give you a hint on what is coming. Yes dark souls is a challenge, But you know what has kept me coming back after nearly 1200 hours over multiple consoles? The reward. The insanely gratifying feeling when you kill that boss after so many tries, Get through that area to that fog door, Finally kill that Hacker who has invaded you 30 times. Nothing, and I MEAN NOTHING   compares to that feeling, Especially no other series. Dark souls holds a special place in my heart, It has been there in the hard times in my life to take my mind somewhere new. Get my head strait. It may have an incredible reputation for being super difficult and you will probably hear someone say it is unfair. It may be difficult, but it is not unfair. Any time you die, it is your fault it is something you didn't do, maybe you did not understand it yet. But that in its essence is what dark souls is. A game to help you understand. A game to help you overcome its challenges and make you better prepared for life. Cause thats really in an essence how we deal with life, LIke a moth Flittering towards a flame.			"

												Bought it after hearing it was challenging and well designed. Within 5 hours I could definately see the two shine. After 110 hours I realized I was either overpowered or just better at the game. (Bosses started dying on try 1 or 2)After 138 hours I realized this game was just simply really bumping good. (I've never played anything that does half of what this game does) The developers weren't afraid of trying very different fights later on (which I appreciate)The sparce soundtrack that is almost purely contained in boss fights is thoroughly stellar. The game really knows how to make a guy feel as bad as possible for killing things/people that didn't need to die.Before even finishing I was thinking about the build I would try for my next playthroughAfter beating this with mouse, keyboard, and scythe, I wonder if difficulty is different with a controller :/And Don't Get Me Started On The Lore			"

													I really wanted to like this game, I really wanted a hard game, What I got was a confusing mess. Dark Souls sets of to be an “Old School” game, where the term old school means confusing, unclear, vague, and downright purposefully clunky. 	I knew what I was getting into, a game that is suppose to be tough at first, but over time has solid mechanics that keep you coming back in the same way Ninja Gaiden (Xbox) was. What this game is, is a complete miss an all cylinders.	The game starts off dumping you into a jail/keep where you have to escape from. During that about 20 minutes are very very basic tutorials. Right bumper = swing, right trigger = heavy swing. Which is good, but right after if gives you the button assignments, nothing. Oh and the stats system and leveling up good luck on that, nothing helpful is said about it. It's worth noting that any time your user has to look up a walk through to understand something as central as what stats do what to an RPG game, the developer should really take a step back and ask “How and what information am I communicating to the user?” If what is needed to be conveyed is central to the understanding of the game system, and is purposefully or negligently concealed you have already made a huge mistake. Dark Souls takes this mistake and makes it a central game mechanic.  	I get the sense that at some point the developers wanted to make a fighting/hack and slash system that was consistent, in that there was no slicing through enemies (because you missed the hit box) which is a good idea. Again though the game comes to a crashing to a halt when you consistently die without any understanding of what you could have done differently to result in a better outcome. Again Dark Souls hides information from the user, you'll get combat pop-up bars that are conveying information but what that information is you are never told. Is that meter something positive or a negative? You won't know because at no point does the game ever clue in the player to what their avatar is dealing with. 	I could go on but I have a feeling I'll be drowned out by people telling me I should have played longer then I did. I'm not a teenager, I have a full time job and I get precious few hours of free time. I do not want to use them dealing with a game that seeks to make itself more challenging by keeping information from me.			"

												With the fan made patches to fix resolution issues as well as other tweaks the PC version of this game is hands down the best.  I've played both Demon Souls and Dark Souls on the PS3 and enjoyed each of them.  Replaying this title on the PC was just as fun as the first time I went through it.  While some people have encountered issues with people implementing hacks to clone items and inflate skills I've yet to run into anyone who was doing this myself (Your mileage may vary).The game is hard, the game is unforgiving, and it's fun as all hell.

												""This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."" This was my first thought when Asylum Demon wrecked me for the 6th time... Then I saw that door there. And it took me 1 hour! Yeah I wasn't good in this game, so as other newbies, but instead of giving up I countinued because I was curious what challenges await for me. Then I spent another hour finding out that the skeletons don't want be my friends in the graveyard. *Travel in time* Ornstein and Smough (or Pikachu and Snorlax as I call them) was the first boss fight where I felt that now I need help I won't get through here without help. Then I saw a magnificently glowing sing and with that sign I saw promises for the future. Yeah Solaire got wrecked after we took down Pikachu. But then the reward was beauty and *cough* big ""melons"" >.> what I later found out it was a lie. Okay my review is getting longer so must short it.In short this game was painfully, hard, and sometimes I felt it unfair. Yeah we all know that feel, but it never was unfair, everytime when I died I was about to ragequit but no because then I was thinking ""I'm so stupid bc I did this instead of that"" the game is rewarding, the reward is that you can survive more, get better, and if you take a time you can figure out the story too. I had this dark feeling every locations in this game like in the Painted World, it was so terrifying seeing those corpses as crows biting them (and the surprise crow people was gave me shiver).And now let me talk about the community and PvP. When I first encountered a fight with another player in my second playthrough I was so scared, I ran to Queelag with my phantom and guess what? I got killed because I didn't watched my back and took a chaos stormin full. But then again community is still helpful and after that the ""enemy"" helped with the boss. There are a lot of player still doing PvP, there are honourable players, and there are Darkwaiths and Darkmoonblades. If you don't study your enemies they will kill you PvE experience which needs to PvP.I'm not too good  to short things but finally I can say what's wrong with the game. The only thing what it bothers me, that's the summoning faileds and failed to invade nothing else.I would praise this game untill my death and after that too, If only I could be so grossly incadescent.

cons:-Areas left unfinished like Lost Izalith.-Heavy framerate issues even with dsfix, really really bad port in general.-Areas with even more framerate issues.-In a game that encourages different builds, too much value is given to the endurance stat. Also resistance is futile.-DEX makes casting spells faster, which makes no sense-Reusing a really bad boss multiple times.-Durability is a joke.-Gravelord covenant is a messy mess that could have been very entertaining.-White Way covenant is virtually useless.-Good luck invading as a Blade of the Darkmoon (even when this game was at peak population).-Badly designed platforms in Crystal Cave, your character slides like its buttered-covered teflon in some parts.-The Bed of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-Some rings are unbalanced, allowing to stack multiple benefits to one statistic, flippy ring is still silly.-Most spells are unoriginal, boring stuff (like the multiple soul arrow spells and fireballs).-Camera lock-on clunky at times.-Camera auto-adjust can make you fall from a platform if you're not careful.-Clunky, bad designed interface for the inventory, very limited in options.-Misleading marketing from bamco in the difficulty of the game when that never was the intention of the director.pros:-its a really good game			"

												As far as the fun goes, it's the best game in Dark Souls series and one of the best games I played in general.Things I liked the most:- Amazing if not the best world design out there- Breathtaking boss fights that can leave you both amazed and frustrated at times- The whole combat mechanic is very well designed & developed- Very deep lore. You can spend hours just reading what this game is all about- One of the rare games with good Co-op- High learning curve. Even after beating the whole game you will still find yourself learning/trying new stuffThings you should look after:- The graphics are bad, but this didn't affect the overall experience for me- PC optimization is bad. During some boss fights FPS can get as low as 10.- Literally unplayable without a controller (unless you are willing to try out some mods)There is no reason to skip this game if you liked any other from Dark Souls series. The newcomers will have a hard time (that's how it goes with any other Souls game) but at the end it is definitely worth the struggle. You will hear someone saying Git Gud :)If I had to rate this game, it would be 9/10 with optimization issues being the only downside. "

												This game has an incredibly cohesive and immersive world, with great level design and enemy placement. It also features a very responsive combat system, and a wide range of possibilities in character design to add replayability. Unfortuntately, its pvp system features bad netcode and no cheat prevention, but it's still fun at times. The game gets called hard because it refuses to hold your hand and no one knows how to deal with that, but it's not really that difficult--it just has an incredibly steep learning curve. It does require the extensive use of a wiki to fully understand, which is very unfortunate, as there are some mechanics that the game only gives you hints for when in reality you need a textbook, for example, weapon upgrade systems. Luckily, such wikis exist, though at times they get things wrong. Overall, a highly engaging and enjoyable game with a very deep background lore. 8/10.Bad PC port, though.			"

												Dark Souls, the game everyone recommended me to play, the game I tried to play a few years back, the game I couldn't play because I went in the wrong direction when I started...A year or two later I decided to give it a shot one more time. This time, I took some time to explore every bit of Firelink Shrine (starting location) and found the ACTUAL easier/do-able sarting path, with ennemies that won't one-shot my character.It's hard, very hard. Especially during the first couple of hours. The learning curve is steep but is also super entertaining. Getting your build right, upgrading your weapons and gears, fighting difficult ennemies and epic bosses, progressing through a fantastic storyline, all of these are the reasons I came to love Dark Souls. I died a lot, I sill do, but learning how the game works and how to defeat every ennemy by learning their patterns and their weak spots really helps a lot.PvP in 2016 isn't like it was back then but it still works. I recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs for their storyline and games with a difficult learning curve.--------------------------------------------------------------Single Player: 10/10 Amazing lore, goergous ennemy design and patterns, stunning landscapeMultiplayer: 7/10 Co-op and PvP both included in the game. Could be betterGraphics: 9/10 Amazing dark theme with beautiful landscapes and interesting locations. Not the most polished graphics but still amazingCommunity: 9/10 Streamers, nice wiki and many videos--------------------------------------------------------------0 Comments	 Subscribe to thread  (?)

												This game changed my life.The combat system is FAR superior to other action RPGs.This is a modern classic.It is, however, a broken PC port. You MUST install DSFIX in order to play the game with a decent experience.It's locked to 30 FPS.If you're frustrated with the poor quality of this pc port, try Dark Souls II. It's a native PC game, not a port, and it runs great.However, you should still play the first Dark Souls. It's an unique experience. Even with all the bugs and glitches and locked FPS.WARNING: You will never be able to play games with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system EVER AGAIN.Also, big fathers.			"

												Dark Souls™: Prepare to Die™ Edition (With two ™'s, it's probably trademarked) is the port everyone asked for, but no one really wanted.Prepare to die is a major tagline for the game, and is the last thing your computer will ever hear, because Dark Souls is so hard, it has the ability to manifest bosses in our world inside your machine, to destroy it from the inside.You start off by making your hero with a powerful character creator, rented straight from Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion team, allowing you to create any type of potato you wish.After you finish your vegetable appearing character, you can finally start the game. Owning a game controller will allow you to skip 3 of the bosses: Lord♥♥♥♥♥♥Camera, and the mentally handicapped siamese twins, Keybohd n' Mawz.The gameplay is ripped from Super Mario 64, with platforming and hopping into paintings to fight bosses, with Metroid and Zelda thrown in for good measure. The soundtrack is actually composed completely by Finnish metal band Apocalyptica, who also designed the whole game, Keeping the frames at a crisp 30 frames per second. It also takes advantage of Microsoft's revolutionary service: Games for Windows LIVE, which brings the power of Xbox LIVE right to your PC! I hope you hate playing video games, because Games for Windows LIVE sure does.Trademarked Souls™: Prepare to Trademark™ Edition is a fine edition to steam, and will compete directly with Valve's first person shooter action sidescrolling point n click adventure game DOTA 2.Awful/5			"

												This game is not for people with thin walls. This game is not for people with quiet neighbors. This is not for people who can cause significant damage to their surroundings when 'lightly' tossing their controller. This IS for people who dont care who hears them scream. This IS for people who love to slowly exhale while muttering every curse word there is known to man after losing 1.3m souls because of narrow walkways. 10/10 and I don't even meet minimum requirements.

												Dark Souls: Prepare To Die.Oooohhh, Dark Souls. You know, I actually avoided playing this game at first (but still nabbing it in a pretty good sale, but let it sit for a year or two in my library...) because of the famed difficulty of the game. I just passed it off as something that it didn't really follow it's tagline.Why did I pass this game up?I completely missed it's prime. What do I mean?This is a single player game that combines multiplayer in it's world. But how? Well, you're given phantoms of what other players are doing at random times, being able to make pre-written messages and warn others (or trick others) about the future obstacles. Some are even more friendly, extending their hand to help escort you through a zone, and even fight bosses with you! Some...will invade your world, in a attempt to take your experience points.Everyone's moved onto DS3, so this game is quieter than it should be. Invasions are rare, co-oping with random players is a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥..most of the PVP groups you can join in the game is rendered useless by the quiet of the game. Thankfully, there almost always seems to be at least a handful of people on, playing the game, at any time of the day.I'm counting this against the game, as, in it's current state, the community playing it has mostly moved on to DS3. Onnnn the other hand, those who prefer to avoid the multiplayer aspect will have a alright time knowing that invasions will be far and few. But it's still something that deters from the experience.Let me adress the tagline, ""Prepare To Die."" Yes, this is a game where you cannot take combat as a joke. If you're unprepared, you will die. Nearly every single time I've died, I've had to blame myself for the mistakes I made. However! There are areas in the game that made me scratch my head in utter confusion and anger when I died. For example, deep within the catacombs, there's a hole you can drop down. However, before you even reach the hole, a creature under it already has locked onto you and is aggro'd against you. So, when I dropped down, there was a high chance I'd be immediately killed IN MID-AIR. While you're in mid-air, you cannot perform any actions. So, you can very well be screwed while falling down. However! There's only a handful of hiccups this game has in it's level design. Such as the example I've personally dealt with. Perhaps I'm just bad at those segments, but there are times when my deaths are constant.A fair warning to you. If you find dragons sittin' around on a bridge, multiple small dragons, do not take them as a joke. No matter what level you are, they will still pose a very serious threat.The combat in this game is satisfying. Oh my. Out of all the games in my library, Dark Souls has the absolute best. Performing Backstabs and Counters for the first time is just badass on every level. And even now, 120 hours into the game, I still find them satisfying and dropping little one-liners to myself with certain weapons. Pure magic players will find a little harsher experience than those who fit magic into their repritoire, but Pyromancers will be fine. Miracles and Sorceries will have to work harder to stay on top.The less you know about Dark Souls, however, the better. Contrary to popular opinion, I actually kinda liked having to figure out the systems and Humanity on my own. So, try to be careful and avoid spoilers if you somehow already have. I say, get this game, and praise the sun! Even despite the fact that one of the biggest aspects of the game is a quiet one now, with DS3 having came out recently...it's still worth your time and money!			"

												I'll divide this review into two sections: Game Review & PC Port Review then you can decide for yourself whether you would want to buy the PC version or look for a console copy.Game ReviewIntro:FROM Software's Soul Series first started by Demon's Souls on PS3. At the time of release, that game revolutionized the concept of difficulty. It was truly a challenging game that needed mastering. Dark Souls is no different, it is indeed very difficult and offers little to no help along the way. Tutorial is nothing more than explanation of controls and a few gameplay basics, nothing more. Dark Souls is not for the faint of heart, it takes a dedicated gamer to finish the game.Pros (+12):- Achievement through struggle, unforgiving difficulty which is very rewarding- Minimalistic plot that's open to player interpretation and fan theories- In-depth character customization and lots of equipment to choose from- Multi-player is uniquely integrated into single-player- Beautiful art design and breath-taking sceneries, visuals are great- High replay value which stems from the NG+ system- Inter-connected world and amazing level-design barring a few rushed locations- Each single step you take has permanent consequences, the game is auto-saved every moment- Epic boss and enemy designs- Even the weakest enemy can kill a careless end-game character, there is no true safety- Teaches real life lessons and is full of metaphors- No quests, no mini-map, no guidance, you are truly alone in a hostile worldCons(-4):- Audio and sound effects are boring and dull, soundtrack is uninteresting- Persistent network issues which will never be fixed- Intentional ""easy mode"" provided by some items or play-styles- Lousy English translation and occasional incomprehensible textGameplay = 10/10 ; Audio = 7/10 ; Visuals = 10/10 ; Story = 10/10Verdict: 9.75/10 - Almost PerfectDark Souls is truly a gem and one of the finest RPG titles of this generation, it is a game with a point to prove, lessons to teach and controllers to break. This is a must-play title for any true gamer in this generation.PC Port ReviewThis horrible monstrosity called a PC port is truly one of the worst ports in all history if not the absolute worst. This game is literally unplayable without a controller, if you're looking to play with Keyboard+Mouse you're going to be deeply disappointed. The game always displays X360 Buttons on the screen. Apart from that, the game itself is locked to 30 FPS and unlocking the framerate with mods causes several issues such as broken ladder animations and extremely short jumping distance.The port itself is borderline broken without the help of various fixes and modifications such as DSFix & PVPWatchdog. This is an utterly terrible PC Port with countless issues and problems that will never be officially fixed. If you have access to a last-generation console, I would highly recommend buying a console version instead because the PC port is plain broken.However, if you insist on playing the game on PC, use of modifications and fixes is mandatory.

												TL;DRI've been playing games since the DOS era, I really lost count of how many games I had played. If my lifespan permits, I would like to experience all the great games ever created, new or old. Dark Souls, is one of the brightest diamonds in history, easily in my top5 of all-time. But 10 years from now, what will happen to the online aspect of Dark Souls? Nothing lasts forever, even all things good will eventually come to an end. Before that happens, if you are a true gamer, do yourself a favour, overcome your own Dark Souls, and you will never be the same again. Put simply, to emerge victorious in this Trial of Mentality, you have to become a stronger person than you are today.9.7/10IF YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO READFor those of you sitting on the fence due to reviews of a bad PC port, worry not. I am playing this on Windows 7, without any controller, without any 3rd party fix, and it works just fine. My guess is they had released a recent patch to fix most of the complaints. You can always change the key bindings to something you like. My only issue is that sometimes the camera is too near, but that is more of a small annoyance since you can't really zoom out.THINGS I LIKE:+ Level up mechanic, reminds me of Diablo 2 but more extensive and better+ Choose the level of online interaction you want at any time, you can play it like Single-player, Co-op or PVP! It's like half an MMO. At minimum there are still some subtle ""interference"" between you and other online players (players can leave messages on ground to warn other players; bloodstains show a ghostly playback of how a previous player died; occasionally see ""ghosts"" moving around which is another real player)+ Variety of weapons & their associated combat moves+ Upgrading system of equipment+ Checkpoint system wil restart you at latest ""touched"" checkpoint when you die+ Epic Boss Fights+ Looting is easy because there is a shiny bright light over anything that is lootable+ No lengthy towning explorations or NPC conversations, just pure adventuring & combat+ 1-slot save system of no regrets+ Unlimited inventory space, take everything you want !+ Most importantly, this game makes you want to play it, you wake up everyday looking forward to your Dark Souls, and honestly, I haven't experience this kind of enthusiasm in any game for a long time			"

												The game humbles you.I know of no other game series that puts you in your place better than the Dark Souls series. The only thing responsible for your deaths is your own stupidity because there is no element of randomness. It's not the AI's fault you died. You failed to predict the actions of an easily readable computer. It's entirely up to you to understand your mistakes and correct them.It's not only difficult; the game reveals itself to be a truly immersive and expansive universe. The way the maps interconnect and the atmospheric lighting and sounds make you feel as if you really are the chosen undead with the world stacked against you. The characters have interesting storylines and perspectives, and the items you pick up come with a description explaining some of the lore that would otherwise go unsaid.Well, what is it? Muster up some patience and begin a fantastic adventure.			"

												This game will make you feel either like a powerless ant or a mighty god. It's just fantastic. Do you like that feeling of being so very close to victory and failing or making by a mere 10 hitpoints? Do you like esoteric game mechanics? Every step is a new discovery and it brings back memories of games from yore that didn't really feel the need to hand hold you all the way to victory. The road to being a god is a tough one, but worth travelling.			"

												Once the annoying GFWL piece was removed, I purchased this game on sale.  I enjoy challenging games so I wasn't afraid of the rumors I heard about Dark Souls' difficulty.  Having never played Demon Souls, the spiritual predecessor, I was completely new to this series.  What I quickly learned is that the game is very overwhelming to new people and seriously lacks adequate in-game tutorials.  Many questions people start off with is ""What character should I be?"", ""Which weapons should I use?"", and ""Which skills should I spend souls on?""  The makers of the Dark Souls seemingly want you to experiment in the game to figure this out and some say this is part of the charm.Since the game can easily take at least 40 hours to complete, I simply didn't feel in the mood to play a difficult game AND not know what the heck is going on.  So what I did instead was to read a few beginner guides to Dark Souls (spoiler-free versions), and I really feel this helped the game be much more enjoyable.  Even several hours into the game I would have to go look up what a certain item is used for on a Dark Souls wiki page as well, for example.As for game play, there isn't much more for me to say that hasn't already been said 100x over.  I definitely recommend the game for those who enjoy challenging RPGs with emphasis on action fighting.  The large amount of big boss battles will give plenty of satisfaction.  The story and sense of adventure will also make you incredibly curious with each new area you enter.  When you are new to this game, it will engross you to the point that when you aren't playing, you'll be thinking about what is next and/or how to defeat a boss who has already killed you 10+ times.  This is one of those games you'll never forget.			"

												This is a HORRIBLE port. You have to use mods to even get it to be even slightly enjoyable. You are pretty much screwed if you do not have a gamepad of some sort because it is pretty much impossible to play without one. Don't get me wrong, this game is amazing on console and if you actually get it working correctly on PC, but I just can't recommend it.			"

												One of the best Co-op Games out there and the best Dark Souls Titles.Since Dark Souls Prepare to die Edition has been ported completly to Steam, it now has Steam Achievements which could off been ported over from the GFWL Version but you didn't have to. This Game is probably a the only Masterpiece in the Series. Why is that? Poise. Poise funktions and the game was not made to be difficult, it was made the way it should off been to be a game. Whilst other Dark Souls Games will Cheese you with the same copy + paste enemy, this games enemys are actually different from each other and have different attacks. This Game turned out to be difficult but fair. Unlike other Dark Souls titles that were made to be difficult and not fair at all. This Game is by far the best one they ever made and I think everybody should try it out and give it a little bit time. I took me 65 hours to like the game and 80 hours to find myself not dying around every corner, but all the struggle was worth it, since this now one of my favourite games that I play to this day.Since this Game is a bit older then the other Dark Souls Titles, the community actually made a connectivity Mod and a PVP Watchdog mod, where you can simply kick cheaters out. You also can install costum textures without getting banned.I can recommend this Game to anybody that loves challenges and Metroidvania Games for its full price, as you might spent more then 100 hours on it, however if you unsure whether you like it or not just grab it on sale or buy a cheap key.

												God damn, I love this game! I will admit that the biggest reason is because it finally showed all the garbage that's been infesting my beloved hobby for the last decade that they ain't worth♥♥♥♥♥♥(and made them beg for an easy mode which they never got), but also because the game itself is simply fantastic. I will warn you now though, the PC port is functional at best. You're most likely better off playing it on PS3 or 360 but if you're dead set on the PC version then  make sure you get DSfix, Dark Souls PVP Watchdog, the Dark Souls Connectivity Mod and a gamepad! These will make your time with the game a lot less headache inducing. STORY  This game handles its story very well. I won't go into details, but I will say that the story and lore of Dark Souls is pretty damn good, HOWEVER the majority of it you'll have peace together yourself by talking to people and reading item descriptions, so if you're one of those babies who ""plays"" games for the story, but also expect everything to be given to you on a silver platter, this game isn't for you. On the other hand if you don't care for story at all then you don't have to worry as you can skip every cutscene, every piece of dialogue and aside from very few exceptions you aren't technically required to talk to anyone to progress through the game.Hence why I said this game handles its story very well: If you care for story there's plenty of it, but if you just want to play the game there's nothing stopping you from doing so. muh grafix  This game came out in 2011 on consoles, so don't really expect mind blowing grafix, however from an aesthetic standpoint it looks amazing. I may get some flak for this but to me DS1 looks ten times more pleasing than both its sequels. MUSIC  Dark Souls has little in terms of music, but what little there is was composed by JRPG Jesus himself: Motoi Sakuraba and it's all fantastic. I wouldn't say its his best work, but every track fits perfectly with the place or event where it plays. Would you remember it for years to come? Eh, I don't know, that really depends on what kind of music you like. I prefer Sakuraba's rocking soundtracks so this one won't stick with me till the end of time, but that's just me. GAMEPLAY  I won't bother explaining the gameplay basics of this game, thats what the tutorial is for HOWEVER I will get this out of the way right now.Dark Souls requires you to use your brain, pay attention and plan things ahead. Going #YOLO#SWAG#SuchANerd here will only get you the YOU DIED screen over and over again. You won't believe how many times I've been called a masochist or being asked why I hate myself by people every time I launch the game, which always leaves me scratching my head. I then proceed get completely disregarded when I try to explain why the game isn't balls hard like some memers make it out to be or end up hurting someone's fee fees when I tell them they are just♥♥♥♥♥♥Now I'm not saying this game is perfect, there are things I like and things I don't like just like every single game in existence.What I like the most is how the game absolutely lets you tailor your own playstyle, because many of the weapons have their own unique movesets which makes them handle differently. You want to swing a massive greatsword like Guts: you can. Want to be a rapier thrusting♥♥♥♥♥ you can. Want to fight from a distance with a spear: you can. Become the ultimate edgelord with katana and fedora: you can. Go ranged with bow/crossbow or become the ultimate nerd (Mage): you can do it. The starting class you pick really isn't all that important as you can become something completely different by the time you reach the end.Another thing I really like is how the game handles its multiplayer component. While you're alone for the majority of the game you'll sometimes see the ghosts of other players as well as bloodstains (which indicate they died there, touching one of those lets you get an idea of what happened to that player which in turn might give you some knowledge in advance). Once you restore your humanity at a bonfire you automatically go online. While human you can be invaded by or summon other players for either Co-op or PVP, you can also invade or leave a summon sign yourself (note that co-op and PVP work only in areas where the boss hasn't been defeated yet, so for example you can't summon people or get invaded in an area where you've already slain the boss, but you can invade or be summoned by people who haven't killed him yet). There are several covenants (think something like a guild) you can join if desired. Some are focused on Co-op, some on PVP and others have PVE uses. Leveling up your rank in whichever covenant you belong to will also gives you neat rewards, so it's definitely something worthwhile. My personal favorite is the Forest Hunters aka gank everyone who dares to set foot in the forest.I also love the world you get to explore. I went in completely blind for my very first playthrough and ended up having to draw a map on paper just to keep up with all the interconnected areas. I haven't done something like this since the 90s.For things I dislike: There are a couple of moments in the game that are just cheap and while the majority of the bosses are fun to fight there are several of them that are just reskins and some (like the Bed of Chaos) that are just badly designed and are not enjoyable to fight at all. Some areas of the game can also get on your nerves: Blighttown is the most famous example of that. The zone itself isn't THAT bad but the massive framerate drops is what kills it. I really wouldn't mind if the zone was optional but sadly you have to pass through it to progress through the game. Multiplayer wise on PC you're bound to run into cheaters and sadly the PVP watchdog can't get rid of every single one of them. However 14 year olds with no skill who have to resort to cheating isn't exclusive to this game (it always makes me smile when I beat them at their own game though).Overall though, these cases are few and far between and don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game. TL;DR Dark Souls is a game that takes me back to the good old days when both eastern and western video games were good, when games required you to work for your satisfaction instead of spoon-feeding you constantly in order to avoid hurting your fee fees and I love it for that. It's far from the perfect game but the few shortcomings it has I can overlook simply because it does everything else so well. It is in no way, shape or form a game for masochists, nor is it the hardest game ever made and to all those who keep spouting this crap, please stop playing video games and go back to facebook or whatever, you'll be making the rest of us a massive favor.

												I had heard quite a lot about Dark Souls: Prepare to Fun Edition before I went ahead and decided it was time I picked it up. I had actually heard about enough to give me the impression  that buying it would end up being a mistake because I would find myself quitting before I managed to get so much as a quarter of the way into the game because of the 2hard4me. Ironically enough I couldn't put it down because of the♥♥♥♥♥kicking I was getting initially being a lot different from the lackluster wins it seems every other game throws out.  Albeit that Dark Souls is just about as far as one can get from a walk in the park with a title made in recent times (save for the most irritating of indie games) it's nowhere near as bad as most will set it out to be. There are almost no situations where I felt that what was happening was just plain unfair and the deaths were anyone's fault but my own. Every challenge presented could be easily overcome by taking things slowly and getting the timing right. If you're used to the hand-holding of modern day pewpewbangbangbang games like I am then maybe you'll have a little (or a lot) more trouble than you should be having with whomever (Carpa, stop plis; it hurts). The animation quality is to die for, I have never once played a game where I sat in an area toying with weapons just to see what the attacks looked like before but I've spent hours doing so here. Regardless of if I planned on using it or not when I got a new weapon different from what I had seen before I was excited to see what it was like. I've now gone as far as making builds just to try weapons I didn't get to use in combat before due to stats. Voice acting is another point of interest, most characters were unique enough to actually want to talk to. On the down side the story could have been portrayed a lot better in game, I myself had to watch a countless amount of Youtube videos to get in on what was happening beyond the basic outline. If you decide to go ahead and do so then chances are you'll realize you missed quite a lot of the plot while playing through. The dreaded four letters also take a part in Dark Souls, GFWL (best system 10/10); on top of that connection is P2P so without DSCfix good luck summoning anyone, really. Although I've met a decent enough amount of people who have adapted to playing with mouse and keyboard I would still have to put down that playing without a gamepad is rather difficult. Dark Souls easily places in my top five favorite games and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next one. Praise the Sun, praise the sun, praise the sun praise the sun, praise the sun. TL;DR Gaem is gud, buy.			"

												First off let me tell you that this isnt a ♥♥♥♥ing game, its a MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING NIGHTMARE BRO! 5 Minutes out of the Firelink shrine i find myself greeted by what i call ""The Welcoming Comitee"". Composed of rotted flesh and stanky♥♥♥♥♥bones, this rag tag group of miscreants may seem like nothing more than trash mobs before the big boss, but dont be fooled. These conniving, conspiring, crestaceous mongoloids will utterly skull ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥to no end with their insane knowledge of gokus ability to falcon punch you a thousand times within the window of a few seconds with their daggers forged in the fires of mount go♥♥♥♥yourself. It took me 30 hrs to master the ways of the welcoming comitee, and since then i feel ive accomplished little to no tasks in my life that have been more gratifying. Although i did come across a foe i fear has been created just to spite me. In the cave of the giants there lies a string of beasts that no man should dare to seek. They thrive in the darkness and live only to bring you to the brink of shoving your controller up your♥♥♥♥♥ I call them RA-RA-RA's. Beware the giant skeletal canine-like beasts that will endlessly tear your character several new asses. As i reached the end of this game and entered the final room to the final boss. I felt as if my journey had been one of a kind. I had spent days, weeks, traversing this land, uncovering its secrets, and now it all ended here. I entered the room and suddenly i was blown away by the saddening music and atmosphere before me. It was almost too late to notice my foe mid air flying towards me. I set the controller down. Took a deep breathe. It was over. I won... i felt relief, then happiness. Then sadness. BUT WHY SADNESS THIS GAME TORCHERED ME TO THE BRINK?! Thats when i realized that this is more than a game, its a nightmare and nightmares become part of us, part of our souls. They define aspects of our lives, this game was the embodiment of my DARK SOUL. 100/10 would dark soul again.			"

A beutifully designed, unfathomably deep, and truly rewarding odyssey that feels intensely and brilliantly alive in nearly every conceivable respect.*Please be aware that Durante's 'DSfix' is an essential mod for this lacklustre PC port, so be sure to install it before even attempting to play*When industry pundits make reference to a ""hardcore"" game, this is exactly the kind they're talking about. Dark Souls is the game that brings roguelikes bang up-to-date, and with what style it does so.Touting a brutal learning curve and an equally chilly approach to player tutoring, Dark Souls is a ruthless RPG of peerless satisfaction once you master it's deceptively graceful combat and giddy sense of exploration.As 2010 rolled around I found myself lamenting the current state of RPGs; searching in vain for a setting and approach that would get me excited again. It turns out that this game was just the cure I needed as the failings that spoiled my experience of Skyrim were nowhere to be found in the cursed world of Lordran.Every choice in Dark Souls is a meaningful one; the game is constantly updating your save file so there's no reloading and trying again if something goes wrong. If you lose all of your hard earned souls (the game's currency) then you're out of luck. If you kill an NPC by accident or fail to save another from assassination then that's just too bad. In this game you must live with those mistakes and what a refreshing change it makes for you as a player.I instantly appreciated Dark Souls for its gritty feel, hard as nails gameplay and the simple fact that it made you actually want to go delving into the usually derivative crypts, dungeons and even sewers!The magazine reviews that extolled a huge, connected world with foreboding areas, minimal loading times and a new 'ambient' style of multiplayer seemed too good to be true. To my surprise however; they were dead right on all counts.To me Dark Souls is the game that has finally done difficulty (for established gamers at least) in the right way. Yes it's hard as it can possibly be in the beginning; the game makes no concessions for your initial ignorance or pleas for clarity, but a lot of persistence and a little experimentation goes a long way in this cut-throat realm. All the tools you need to be great in this game are there- the transparent combat is intuitive, simple and easy to get to grips with if you have patience and the tenacity to stick with it and learn the little nuances that soon become second nature.This is one of those rare titles where other games are now being compared to it. ""This is Dark Souls"" or ""it's like Dark Souls"" are things that I catch myself saying regularly, even about games much older than this one. Although it's firmly engrained in the roguelike sub-genre, Dark Souls has such a unique and identifiable feel to it that the new term ""Soulslike"" is starting to gain serious traction for describing any game that bears intense similarities to it.If there was ever a torch-passing moment in modern video game history then this has to be it; from Rogue to Dark Souls, the dream of an uncompromising RPG with depth, complexity and intense satisfaction has been realised all over again. And for a game to accomplish that whilst maintaining such a broad appeal across the industry is a feat that is impressive beyond measure.

TLDR VERDICTDark Souls is an innovative experience that provides challenging, yet extremely satisfying gameplay and a unique twist on multiplayer. Backed up with an intriguing narrative; absolutely stellar world design; all-round fantastic gameplay driven and atmosphere. An absolute must buy or at least try, as I believe everyone should experience this game, even if it doesn’t sound like your thing.FULL REVIEW BELOW”What is bravery, without a dash of recklessness” - Hawkeye Gough You are cursed. You are destined to die, again and again. You will keep dying, until you have lost your purpose and you become nothing but a hollow mindless husk. However, just maybe, there might be something different about you.This review is written from the perspective of a fan of story driven RPG games and games with well-designed open worlds, with an emphasis on player discovery and experimentation.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNDark Souls has fairly straightforward gameplay mechanics that are simple to understand but are supposed to be adapted to your playstyle. Contrary to popular belief, Dark Souls isn’t what I would call an especially hard game. Sure it has difficult moments, but it’s just completely different from what you might expect from an open world RPG, which throws a lot of people off. The game essentially punishes you for relying on what might be the norm in other games of its genre. You need to rely on a more practical way of thinking to get a grip of how the game plays. For example: heavy armour is hard to move around in and big swords are hard to swing.The game introduces its fundamental mechanics very concisely and they aren’t anything you haven’t seen before. You have a health bar, a stamina bar, basic attack mechanics and so on. So if the game has such a simple and unoriginal sounding framework, why does it have such a massive following and a notorious reputation for difficulty? There’s a few reasons. The first is the enemies. Every new enemy in the game is different from the last. You need to observe their movements, their weapon and their body type to find an opening. The enemies are very firm, but fair (for the most part). They all have attack patterns and every pattern is avoidable, with a weakness you can exploit. Gauging what you attacks you can dodge and block and knowing when you can get hits in is all a part of the learning curve. Mastering bosses feels extremely satisfying. There are a few bosses that are arguably pretty “cheap” that might have you fighting the camera controls or jumping mechanics, but these are blemishes in otherwise fantastic array of enemies.Weapon and item variety is also fantastic. Whilst the stats and levelling system may seem overwhelming at first, you get your head around it very quickly and start experimenting. Almost every weapon has different move sets and they all feel unique. Just like studying your enemy’s vulnerabilities, you’ll need to look out for your own and they come from the type of weapon you use. There’s a massive selection of pretty much every fantasy melee and ranged weapon you can think of, with varying designs. If you replay other RPGs for alternate morality choices, you’ll replay Dark Souls for alternate weapon builds. Different weapon types require you to employ different tactics and can make entire playthroughs seem completely fresh even though you only changed your weapons. There is also a very intricate weapon upgrade system, which adds even more depth to the game.Dark Souls also has one of the best implementations of multiplayer I’ve ever seen in a game. The multiplayer is essentially built around the idea that we’re all screwed, but we’re all in this together. You can leave notes for other players that provide hints and sometimes good laughs. You can summon in other players to help you out with tricky areas. You can also invade other players and kill them in PvP combat if you feel really mean.The world design in Dark Souls is seriously genius. A lot of the areas interlock like a maze with shortcuts in logical places that actually make sense within the space of the world. No two areas occupy the same space within the world, everything fits together perfectly and you can see areas in the skybox of other areas. The amount of detail that actually went into the world design is jaw dropping. You navigate the world by walking around and looking for bonfires, which equate to checkpoints. These allow you heal up and bank your hard earned souls, which is basically currency. You lose all of your souls when you die and need to go back to where you died to pick them up. If you die again before getting them, you have lost them forever. This naturally can lead to a lot of stressful moments, especially when there is an invading player standing between you and hours of progress. The stakes just makes triumph all the more rewarding.STORY AND NARRATIVEDark Souls adopts some very subtle story telling techniques. You get a big grand cut scene at the start, that sets the scene for the world, but all the lore after that is pretty much hidden. You can interact with quite a few NPCs, but they only offer small snips of information at most and say more about themselves than the world around them. The other main source of information is item descriptions which can reveal information about specific events or people. This is quite good for people who like to piece together the story based on hints and clues. If you prefer storytelling to be more overt and involved then you might not be a fan.Personally, I am a fan of involved and cutscene/conversation heavy storytelling, but I didn’t mind the Dark Souls approach. It essentially makes the story optional for everyone who wants to ignore it. The main downside is that those hungry for more story may not necessarily want to dig for it and will come away feeling unfulfilled. I initially felt that, as I was constantly discovering awesome looking areas and enemies and kept thinking “what happened here?” and there wouldn’t really be a proper explanation. Of course, the game has a great community and the story explanations are all on YouTube (lookup VaatiVidya after playing the game) but the fact you have to go to YouTube can be a detracting factor.GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEDark Souls is a really rough PC port. It is essentially a complete copy and paste of the console version. It runs at 720p capped at 30fps and used to have GFWL. GFWL has now been patched out and the game now uses Steamworks which is a huge improvement. The bulk of the issues are fixed by an absolutely essential mod called dsfix, which uncaps the framerate and offers better graphics options amongst other fixes. The multiplayer elements also had some serious connectivity issues whilst on GFWL. In my experience, the Steamworks patch works well when playing the game normally. You get a good amount of multiplayer play, but may have issues trying to play with a specific friend.Dark Souls has absolutely stunning art direction. All the environments, equipment and enemies are really uniquely designed and definitely emphasise the variety of locations you’re exploring throughout the game. It also does an excellent job of conveying all these completely diverse environments, which are still seamlessly interconnected. The boss enemy designs are especially well done. Almost every boss evokes some kind of emotional reaction, whether its terror, pity or respect. The actual graphical fidelity in the vanilla game looks passable for the time (2011), but the aforementioned dsfix mod really makes the game a lot prettier, despite a pretty hefty performance cost.

Pros+ One of the most original and unique games I've ever played.+ Tough, yet rewarding gameplay. Never know what to expect. Always feels fresh. + Amazing atmosphere and a great soundtrack to compliment it.+ Addicting and immersive. + Level design is incredible. I love how everything is interconnected.+ Game is packed with content, lore, secrets, and places to explore. High replayability.+ Wide variety of settingsCons- Some elements of the game are just plain Tedious (Curse, some platforming sections, running back to certain bosses after dying, ect.)This is a game I think everyone should experience. The constant feeling of mystery when walking into a new area and not knowing what to expect at all, the feeling when stumbling across a bosses lair for the first time and wondering how to deal with it while under an immense amount of pressure, the feeling of coming across an NPC and wondering what they're doing there or what their story is, I could go on and on and on. It may take a bit for some to get pulled in by this game, but once you do good luck getting away, as you will constantly be starving for more. This game does of course have minor flaws, but even with them it managed to completely shattered my expectations.Final Score - ★★★★★ "

												One of the best and most challenging games i have played so far. Not only is the game setting pretty dark and scary, Dark Souls is also pretty hard so you will most likely always fear whats behind that door or fogwall, creating a similar atmosphere to horror games.Concerning the difficulty of this game: You can beat the game pretty much naked, and without getting hit a single time for the most parts, but at the same time even with the best gear you can die in a few seconds to some easy monsters if you're not paying attention or do something stupid.Learning from your mistakes is what this game is all about. You will die because you didnt know there was someone lying in an ambush. You will die even knowing there is someone behind that door, but you havent figured out what to to. You will die even knowing a good strategy to defeat a certain boss or clear an area. The game is fair, so dont blame anyone but yourself, just try it again and try harder, you will succeed eventually.If you're searching for a nice action RPG, a dark fantasy game or just a challenge, Dark Souls is the perfect match!

												I've always enjoyed this game, let it be the exhilerating moments of being in CQC, or the deep lore this game is based upon.It's frustrating, but most of the time it's your fault. MOST of the time, anyway. An area by the name of Lost Izalyth was rushed, so the boss you find there (Bed of Chaos) has a lot of artificial difficulty. There was one time, when I jumped a gap to get to the boss, the GIGANTIC arm the boss slaps you around with knocked me across the arena to my death (the developers didn't do this on purpose, they just rushed the boss). The floor also crumbles beneath your feet when you reach a certain point in the boss fight. Any unsuspecting noob can fall through, since the game doesn't warn you ahead of time.Then there's the Capra Demon, though to a lesser extent. When you walk into the arena, the space you fight in isn't that big, and most noobs die before they can react in time to the dogs and the boss. After that, the boss fight isn't that bad.This is the most artificial difficulty I remember, though some bugs are out there that can spoil the fun at times.                            TIME FOR THE GOOD STUFFThe game is open world, but in a semi-linear way. It's not the GTA V open world you're thinking of, but instead it's an open world because you can go into areas if you have the skill or equipment. It's not a level requirement, but instead a skill requirement. That's probably one of the best things about the game.The combat is done quite well. You have a light attack, a strong attack, a block, a parry (if you're not two-handing your weapon), you can two-hand your weapon, and you can roll. This means you're able to endure a fight without getting hit. When you roll, you have a part of the roll that makes you invulnrable. Don't expect to land the roll perfectly every time. It takes practice and patience to learn when to roll, and when NOT to. When you parry, there is a part of the parry that can slap aside the enemy's weapon. After doing a successful parry, you can repost the enemy for a large amount of damage. This also takes practice to land, so don't quit the game after not being able to parry successfully. When you two-hand a weapon, your strength increases by 1.5x the amount it was previously. This also adds some extra damage, so it's worth it.Most of the bosses in Dark Souls are okay. Some of them are annoying, some are just too easy. I'm not going to spoil any more bosses, since they're better when you don't know them very well.The lore in this game is extremely deep, and you can piece it together by reading item descriptions. If you need help figuring out the lore, check out https://www.youtube.com/user/VaatiVidya . He has a few videos on Dark Souls 1.That's it, I don't want to spoil the areas, so play the game yourself.			"

												Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition is a fantastic game. I have never thought that I will enjoy this game that much so that's why I am going to share my experience and information about this game with you.The main element of this game, as you can imagine by reading the name of the game, is DYING! You will die very often and if you are not prepared to die, do not play this game, because otherwise you are going to rage-quit or delete this game.If you are ready to die, let's continue with reading this and let's say something important about this game.DS:PTD is, in my words, single-player game mixed with multi-player. The thing is, that you feel like you play single-player, however, in a moment you realize that your world is connected to other worlds and you are kind of linked with other people. If you use your humanity (in-game item) to become a human as you were before you've died, you will ""enter"" the multi-player. It sounds hard or maybe I can't explain it that well, but once you are human, you can invade other worlds - it means going PVP with another Online Player, you can be invaded - somebody will come to your world to kill you OR, you can summon a player who would like to co-op with you. That's why I like this game so much. Are you bored of killing NPCs, monsters, bosses? Just invade other world and feel the power of real Player-versus-Player. Is it hard to kill the boss in your world? Try to find summoning symbols on the ground and summon player to help you and kill that big as*hole together!! If I wanted to sum up everything this game offers, this ""review"" would be super long. This game is in open/closed world (it means that nobody tells you directly where to go. Everything is up to you. Where to go, where have you been,(there is no map, ok? you must use your brain!) where would you like to go, which area you choose first to go to or what to use/level up. However, those areas are connected together that perfectly that you can't get lost unless you are completely brain-dead. ), containing lvling-up, modifying your weapons, learning spells and having super great time with your character. PS. Very important to say! This game IS VERY CHALLENGING and DOES GIVE YOU great REWARDS!I would hardly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play challenging/rewarding game and likes this genre of game. (I would compare it with Skyrim or games like that, but don't blame me if you feel that you can't compare Skyrim with Dark Souls, because it is completely different. Maybe..it is :D, haven't played Skyrim long enough yet )Also, I would not recommend this game to players who are used to do ONLY what they are being told, to players, who likes playing games on ""easy-difficulty"" (in this game, there is NO difficulty to choose. It is ""Hard""-difficulty, so get used to it) and to players, who are not ready to DIE! :)If you liked my ""little-review"", please, rate it up or comment below to let me know if I can improve something for next time!Thanks for reading it.Kubusta			"

												Before you read any further let me make one thing clear- this game is very, very good. Exceptional even, so many elements of it are masterfully designed to give a totally different and amazing gaming experience. So, lets get the elephant in the room out of the way- Difficulty.Yes this game is hard- especially the start. In fact you will probably doubt that you'll get to the end of it after the first hour or so, however, it is vitally important to stick with it. You will improve your skills massively in time, things that seemed nearly impossible will become almost trivially easy, this is part of the charm. You feel yourself grow in ability so much, relying only on your sharpened skills to take on truly overwhelming challenge and succeeding. The way difficulty works in this game is masterful. The gameplay is great, what feels clunky and unusable at first becomes very smooth and responsive in experienced hands, this game above any other I've played has one of the strongest connections of your wits to your performance, which is invigorating for tough fights.  The world in which it all takes place is despiringly bleak and desperate, the story is not told to you. Instead you are placed in a world and have to make your own conclusions about it's denizens and their motivations, the events that transpire and what it all means. This again is quite different to most games and triggers the curiousity in you much more than the standard formula, it has a feel almost like the old 'Myst' on PC (although it is not puzzle based).Having the hindsight of multiple completions and nearly 300 hours play, I would rank this game as a modern classic. So much of it is a fundamentally different and richer experience than most games around these days. The more you play the more you realise the genius and originality of the design.***As an aside- one word of warning. I would research online as to how to build your character and how to make strong weapons, it is not at all obvious and the game could be made much to difficult if you don't do it correctly.***As a second and vitally important aside- Get an xbox controller for your PC if you are buying this. Mouse and keyboard was unplayable. They are fairly cheap and can be used for other games that work best with controller too. I already had one for use with a gamecube emulator.			"

												A soothing adventure game set in the peaceful Kingdom of Lordran, from Firelink Shrine to the Depths you'll have an interesting world to explore as you come across its kind inhabitants who will help you learn of how this once great land came to fall. Experience places like; Sen's Fortress where you will feel safe and comforted by its many guards and defenses, the shining city of Anor Londo and the vibrant and cheerful Painted World of Ariamis. Meet the ever-helpful characters; the Bell Gargoyles (be careful one lies and one tells the truth), the Capra Demon (he's more friendly than he sounds), the Dragon Slayer Ornstein and his best friend Smough. Then, before you leave don't forget to gaze upon the wonderous creatures; the Moonlight Butterfly, the Gaping Dragon and the Great Grey Wolf Sif.☼ Praise the Sun! ☼			"

												Despite its marketing, Dark Souls is designed to make you feel something. Rather than likening it to other games – most of which are purely about sensory stimulation – I prefer to compare Dark Souls to an album. More particularly, an extreme metal album. Like an extreme metal album, Dark Souls is incredibly inaccessible. It has no desire for mass appeal. In fact, it thrives on alienation. It wants only the dedicated, the people who will strive to understand what it is trying to convey.Also, like an extreme metal album, Dark Souls has an emotional agenda. It has one united vision. It wants you to feel isolated. It wants you to feel empty. It wants you to feel like you are nothing, and that everything around you has more right to exist than you. It succeeds. The monster design, the level design, the sound assets, the silence – all these things combine to unnerve and depress you. More than anything though, Dark Souls wants you to prove it wrong. It wants you to prove that you have a right to exist in its world, despite everything it throws at you. It pummels you to the ground, yet it gives you hope. It gives you a reason to press on, even when everything seems lost. It wants you to go in as one person, and leave as another.			"

I myself am not one of these people over 20 hours of playtime into the game I gave up this game is for people looking for a serious challenge.  Just like the name says prepare to die cause you will die a lot.  I plan on going back to this game eventually and sitting down beating it but every time I look it I get so mad because other players can invade your realm and kill you on top of the challenge this game presents.   Its not for the casual weekend gamer at all its for the “hardcore dedicated have to beat it gamers”.  Two of my friends have beat I have not :(  Anyone who beats this game deserves your praise even if you have never played it or never intend on playing it.  That’s how much of challenge this game is.

												Pfft, you really think you're ready for this? You think you're pro-MLG enough to handle this one? Maybe you should turn around and go back to Skyrim or Terraria or whatever other CASUL ""game"" you waddle around in. If you really think you're ready to step up your game and try your hand at Dank Souls, lemme give you an accurate depiction of your fate:- You will die.- You will die a lot.- You will die for basically most of your time playing.- Death will befall you.- Your life will be ended.- Your shirts will be colored red in your blood, which will ironically make you die even more.- Imagine one of those games where you estimate the number of candies or rat testes or some other small things that've been put in a jar. Now imagine all of it has been replaced with instances of your death. Okay? That's a pretty accurate description, I think. Yeah. It'll do.Basically the game is hard, or at least it is to CASULS like you. Don't even pick this game up unless you already know every enemy attack animation as well as every parry frame and weapon moveset in the game with some side knowledge of every misc item in the game and all the secret passages.Or you could learn as you go. I mean, that'd be okay I guess. I mean, that's probably what makes Dank Souls so great is that you learn as you go, no matter how many times you die. UNLESS YOU'RE PRO-MLG LIKE ME, IN WHICH CASE YOU NEVER DIE BECAUSE I NEVER DIE EVER.In PvE you will face off against BALANCED and 100% QUALITY enemies such as the ""bed of chaos"" and ""torch hollows."" The combat in Dark Souls is directly tied into user and enemy animations, so the player will have to be forced to learn patterns AS WELL AS the patterns the player will utilize and change via weapon choices, since all weapons basically have their own unique moveset and sets of strengths/weaksauce weaknesses...except for the CHAOSHANDER, which only has strengths.In PvP you will be butt-devastated by a gigantic flurry of backstabs the like of which you will never have thought could exist. Take every game in the Assassin's Creed series and then add up all the backstabs players could possibly execute at any point (possibly an infinite value due to respawning NPCs?) and then multiply it by five.Okay.Good.You're still not even close.The combat is still tied into animations, except now it's entirely based on PLAYER movesets. This means PvP is primarily dominated by those who learned the strengths and weaknesses of (at least most of) the gear in the game.AKA THEY LEARNED HOW TO ABUSE THE SYSTEM AND GET FREE BUTTSTABS.FREE BUTTSTABS!!!IT'S A TRAVESTY.Basically the backstab system in Dar- I mean Dank Souls isn't all that quality-laden. Dark Souls II (notice how I didn't say DANK SOULS II) attempted to fix this, and it did a fair job of doing so. Except for how Dark Souls II isn't as good as Dank Souls, and should be avoided.Just saying.I'm not going to go into the lore because you can just do a google search (""DANK SOULS LORE FUNNY CAT IMAGES"") and see 999,999,998 ""people"" go ""OH YES IT'S SOOOOO DEEP AND MEANINGFUL BUT SUBTLE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE OMGGGG YOU HAVE TO DISCOVER IT FOR YOURSELF.""They're right, of course. It still doesn't need another reiteration though. You get the point after a while.In conclusion, Dank Souls is an amazing triumph of the game market and is more akin to an interactive work of art THAT HATES YOU.If you have any disagreements then I'll have to ask you to 1v1 me. Watch out though 'cause my zweihander don't play no games son.10/10			"

												You're basically a detective picking up the pieces of what has happened in this world. It presents you a world that has gone to ruin. Whether you play this game actively or passively is up to your intellect as a human. Engage with the world and with your mind. Look at the world, observe the clues presented to your subtly. You have to think about what you're seeing as well as reading and listening dialogue and text. You could simply just play the game and ignore everything that's being shown to you. Killing bosses, enemies, and people mindlessly--like other RPGs. The problem with modern RPGs is that you're just doing what they tell you and va-la: exp, loot, and more quests. Some people would play DS once, but like someone stated, ""It's not a game, it's a experience."" People have overcome real life issues through this game. The world of Dark Souls is filled with tragedy. Love is corrupted and turned rotten, cities fall into ruin and war, kings embrace madness and fear, the Gods--forsaken, great heroes overcome by true darkness, even Solaire: forgotten and only vestiges of his exsistance remain. Dark Souls reflects our world. The greatest people are forgotten, no matter how much joy they bring to an indivisual's life, overtime, such happiness has evaporated. Nations rise and fall. The people swept away--then brought back. ""Humans assuming a fleeting form."" People that give up are left on the side of the road and pillaged for what they were worth.

												Dark Souls is not a game for everyone. It will torture you, punish you and laugh at you, all at the same. But it will never be unfair. It will always play by the rules. Any mistakes you make are entirely your own. This game is hard. Maybe not all the time, depending on your build, but you will die. Not once, not twice. Hundreds of time. And you'll probably keep playing. Because the world of Dark Souls is something that needs to be experienced. I've rarely seen a world this detailed and this well executed. It reminded me a bit of a Metroidvania game, where instead of searching for upgrades you decide what to upgrade, thanks to the souls you'll collect from killed enemies. Before moving on to that part let me say that the textures in this game are simply amazing.As I said, souls allow you to upgrade your character. But only at a bonfire. If you get killed before reaching a bonfire, you lose your souls. You'll resurrect as an undead (again) and get another chance at collecting your lost souls. But the enemies will have respawned and if you die again before reaching them, you'll never be able to recover them. It's tough and frustrating.Enemies will attack you from all sides, there's danger everywhere. You have to remember when and how your enemy attacks, detect their patterns.With humanity you can become human again. This allows you to summon NPC's or friends. These allies are extremely helpful in tough situations. The only consequence of being human is the fact that other players can invade your world. This is frustrating if you haven't saved at a bonfire or/and the other player is simply too strong. Defeat them and you'll gain plenty of souls, though.It's a choice you have to make, but just remember that humanity is hard to come by, especially in the beginning, so summoning someone isn't always the proper solution.As of today I still haven't finished the game. It should take you at least 60-80 hours to beat, and that's a first playthrough. You'll never be able to see, do and collect all the stuff you want in your first playthrough. It's simply impossible. There's so much to take into account.Dark Souls is a brilliant game that only the strong will be able to finish. It's one of my personal goals, although I doubt I'll ever be able to finish it. It requires a lot of dedication. If you're one of those persons I strongly suggest you play this game. You'll not be disappointed.(Use the Dsfix to improve the graphics and performance of the game. Don't start your first game without it.)EDIT: I managed to finish this just a few days after posting the review. I'm not going to rewrite the entire thing as I still agree with most of what I've written. Dark Souls has entered my personal top 3 of favorite games ever so it doesn't need any further explanation.[Rating: 96/100]			"

												If you wanted to give this game a try because you heard it was challenging, I would advise you to look elsewhere. That's not to say it's ""easy"" even if you know exactly what to do, just that it's the extremely cheap sort of ""challenge"", like playing rock-paper-scissors with three fingers sawn off while the other guy plays with both hands. The short version is that most of the enemies have access to powers/abilities/outright hacks that you most certainly don't and you pretty  much have to look up guides and wikis to get through areas, moreso bosses, in a timely fashion. There is a bit of fun to be had here, but I feel like the game should have a South Park-esque warning label: ""All combat is made to look more difficult than it rightly should be... Poorly. Due to shamelessly fake difficulty the following game should not be played by anyone.""You can enjoy the game, but less so as you notice the many, many ways it plain cheats.Starting with the obvious and thus possibly taken for granted; enemies have infinite ammo and spells to throw at you. You have no such thing. Those arrows, bolts, spears, magefire, and the rest can hit you from distances the player can't even target from. Even if you could lock onto things from the distances they apparently can, your magic dissipates into nothing at what can be insultingly short ranges and projectiles lose impact before too long. Enemy fire always seems to do full damage. Finally, enemy projectiles of all sorts will arc mid-air to hit you. I can understand magic doing this, as it's magic, and the player's Soul Arrows can curve a little bit as well, but ordinary arrows fired by you do not.Speaking of curving in mid-air, most humanoid enemies seem to have some kind of leaping lunge attack that can track your position and hit you by changing the direction of the attack as they're flying, weapon raised. Once more, the player cannot do this.Quite a few foes have unblockable one-hit kill attacks, usually in the form of a grapple that can kill you from full health if you aren't pouring points into Health from the start. Some enemies (Silver Knights in Anor Londo especially, in my experience) can block damage with their shields when not blocking at all, but your weapon touches the shield before touching their bodies. The player has no such ability, even with the most powerful tower shield in the game.Fair's fair if we could do everything they could, I could understand calling that a challenge to use the AI's own tricks against them. However, they're all advantages that monsters will hold over you forever, which is pretty close to the definition of unfair. Certainly, you can strike back on some of the bosses with unfair tactics, but is that the sort of gameplay you were hoping for here?A general limitation on the combat is the inability to move while firing a bow or crossbow, because if you could there would be no reason not to kite pretty much every boss to death. Challenge lies in overcoming an obstacle, be it in the form of the environment or an enemy. It is not being told you just can't walk around it because that would be too easy and the powers that be were too lazy to place different obstacles for those that pick a different path instead of great big walls. That is to say, ranged combat is not a viable means of getting through the game for most people because there wouldn't even be an illusion of challenge if it were.Now, there's an obvious reason for these things, ""It wouldn't be challenging otherwise!"" That there, I think, should say everything that needs to be said about the game, without these cheap tricks, it's not challenging at all, and as challenge is not defined by cheap tricks, it follows that Dark Souls is not a challenging game as much as it is a cheap, frustrating one. I've played for over 300 hours, (cutting out what might mostly have been grinding for items or standing around waiting to be summoned as a phantom while doing something else outside the game) and in that time I found ignoring the broken difficulty more of a challenge than any of the bosses, the only remote enjoyment I derive anymore comes from helping other people kill bosses in the now-legendary feat of Jolly Cooperation. Even that wears thin when you're only getting called maybe three times an hour in the highest-traffic summoning spots.None of this is even taking into account the Invasion mechanic, in which players likely more experienced than you can jump into your world under certain circumstances and kill you for a laugh, or completely subjective things that might have just been me, like randomly slipping off cliffs when standing a good few feet away from them.I have two ideas of challenge in a game, God of War and Saint's Row. The former features some difficult combat that can be overcome through skill and determination. The latter features a bunch of rat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with rocket launchers that you're more likely to overcome through dumb luck or even cheat codes. Dark Souls falls on the Saint's Row end of the spectrum, fake difficulty taken to an artform. If all you'd like is a big, dark world to explore, peppered with bosses to kill in a romp of medieval fantasy violence... Then I'd recommend a Castlevania game instead.			"

												Playing Dark Souls for the first time harkens back to how we played games as children. I often found myself lost - not knowing where to go, or what to expect from enemies past the bonfire. The beautifully designed enviorments, the punishing nature of the combat, as well as the little tidbits of lore scattered throughout the game all do a phenomenal job at immersing the player into the gameworld. Dark Souls is far from perfect, but it's the quintessential action roleplaying game. If you still haven't played it for whatever reason, now is as good a time as any.			"

												I sadly cannot recommend this game. It's an Xbox port and it’s a horrible port! In game you get hints like ""Press (A) to read document"" but you have no idea what the A button should be on the keyboard. (by defaults it's Q instead of E) In the options there is no comparison to a controller, so you have to know what button does what on the Xbox version. I tried to play it with an Xbox controller but that thing's not working and there is no option to enable or disable or at least change key mapping of a controller. Oh and did I mention, that the default key to open the game menu is END not ESC?Graphics are pretty bad depending on the standard 1024x726 resolution that is just stretched to 1920x1080 but there is a patch that increases internal resolution and adds some fine shader-effects like more realistic lightning and so. I really recommend that patch if you want to play that game on a PC.I really wanted to give this game a chance but there is sadly no way to play it. Mouse sensitive is way too high and you cannot change it without a patch. I mostly have no idea what to press because the game tells me only the button I should press on a Xbox controller and like I said already: My Logitech Xbox controller which works in EVERY other game, does not work in Dark Souls.

												I can easily call it the best game of this generation.It has a beautiful story, which YOU have to figure out! It's not like a movie, where you see everything happening, you only experience the story from your point of view. The game offers you two endings, but neither of them are ""good"" or ""bad"". Their morale depends on your understanding of the story. I highly recommend trying it out if you have the chance.			"

												Someone tells you to ring some bell and something will happen, so naive undead that you are, you just start wandering around to see if you find it by chance. You fight some little guys, and it's alright. Then you reach a big guy. He'll be less alright. So he pulverises you once or twice (I lied it was at least 25), but you are starting to figure it out. On your way to finally beat him, and something new pops up on your screen: Phantom NastyWasty69420 has invaded. A haunting voice, deep and coming from everywhere and nowhere at once booms ""HELLO"". You freeze and look around. There, a glowing, naked, red man is running towards you, holding a club the same size as you. He stops in front of you and gives a wave. So you wave back. Then he runs in circles a few times. You're concerned, but he hasn't done anything hostile yet, so you don't attack. What comes next in such an interaction? You don't know, so you wait. A glowing patch appears beneath him, an item! You pick it up, and find a set of armour that looks comedically fat. You equip it to humor him, only to find when you exit the menu, he is also wearing it. He then throws down some glowing things on the ground in a circle. The two of you stand for a moment in the circle, then he drops something and the booming voice returns, ""I'M SORRY"". This can't be good. You lock on and raise your shield, backing up. Can you beat him? You doubt it; that's one biiiig club. He waves once more, and runs in a little circle. You've backed perhaps 5 meters away, yet instantaniously he is behind you, his preposterously large club winding up, clipping through the preposterously fat armour. You try desperately to move, to escape, to attack, pressing every button on your controller. To no avail, his club crushes you, killing you instantly. That's not so bad, you've died plenty of times before. What really hurts is the betrayal. His fully upgraded, monstrous club could never do the damage that he has inflicted upon your heart. You spiral fast. Fueled by revenge, you destroy every enemy and boss in your path, beating the game. Then New Game +. Finally you've mastered it. Every dirty trick and cheese in the book. You start a new character, and play through the entire game at a low level. One day, you're invading pathetic newbs in the undead burg, parrying and backstabbing to your hearts content. You start lowering their defenses by giving them humanity and tossing prism stones down. One day, the terrible memory of what NastyWasty69420 did to you resurfaces. You've become that which you hate most. It becomes clear that the humanity that you give to these poor lost undead is because you no longer have use for yours. This is the downward spiral of the chosen undead. This is how dark souls will break you down. Embrace the Dark. Embrace the chaos.10/10, an emotional journey like no other.(My playtime is messed up, it's actually at least 3 times this)			"

												TL;DR: A game infamous for its difficulty, but for those with the time and patience to overcome the steep learning curve, they will find themselves in a deeply detailed beautiful game with one of the most competent combat systems in gaming. Though poorly ported it is still well worth playing with a controller at the ready.Dark Souls is a game that I spent a large amount of my time with on console. Moving over to PC and experiencing it all over again, is time I don't regret spending. The fun from dark souls can be found in many different forms, though difficult as you progress through the game you can see yourself getting better and more powerful. The satisfaction of winning a boss fight, after they have crushed you countless time before is a feeling I have not found elsewhere. Though suffering from some issues such as the framerate cap and poor options this is a part of gaming history you can't miss.Positive features:-In depth combat and weapons variety that can be changed at any time-Beautifully rich and detailed world with varying areas and enemies-Difficulty harsh but fair-Unforgettable boss fights-Clever online system with active PVP community-DLC comes includedNegative features:-30 fps cap-Requires a controller for best experience-Lack of graphical options and settings-Confusing navigation at timesTo conclude Dark Souls is not a game easy to summarise. On console it was amazing and although considered poor for PC, it is still the same game only better and one that is well worth your time, a lot of your time.			"

												There is no game I played in the last few years - probably since N64 times - that fascinated me as much as Dark Souls did (and still does). If you are capable of being patient, like to observe your enemies before attacking, like to suck in the atmosphere the world offers you, like NPCs who laugh a lot ( ;) ) and don't bother about using a controller or get yourself a couple of fixes for the mouse controls, then you're free to go to play one of the best games I've ever played.Stuff you want to download before playing:- DSfix- DSmfix (in case you wanna play with keyboard & mouse; let's be honest, you're probably better off with a controller)- Wulf's Dark Souls Connectivity Mod (in case you wanna play with friends)- PVP Watchdog (in case you wanna be able to kick cheating invaders)			"

												Dark Souls™: Prepare To Die™ Edition is quite an easy game, perfect for kids, people with ptsd and people suffering from some sort of rage problem.The gameplay is quite simple, you have to find the hidden cookies in the bushes, but WHATS THAT? Its Grandma, You have to hurry to find all the cookies fast before grandma catches you. Once you finish finding the hidden cookies the real battle begins.So then you visit a war torn city and help out the nice but sad people who live there, maybe help an old man cross the street, donate some money to the homeless and talk to the head honcho of the neighbourhood.After a nice conversation with him you keep moving towards the religious area of this war torn city and meet many nice people, a nice little piggy and even a trusty smith, you then move towards the chapel and talk to the nice priest there, he explains that the bell has not been rung in ages because the priest's back is not that well and he cannot climb the ladder anymore, so he sends you on a quest to ring the bell, and thats about as much as i want to spoil about this lovely and simple game.Perfect port, Recommend playing with a keyboard or Racing Wheel + Pedals.Score: 6 - Perfect Score.

												The problem is not to defeat the boss, the problem is to rush the zone and get to the boss with enough Estus Flasks!This game is wonderful, and i've played it for only 16-17h. I was a noob like you when i first bought it, i was worried like you are that it was going to be extremely brutal and frustrating, but it isn't for me. Well, it has been for the first 5-6 hours, when i actually thought: ""why have i installed this game, why? It's terrible, it sucks; why should i use a controller, it's not fair; why the ♥♥♥♥ should i download mods for it to play at the ♥♥♥♥ing 60 fps and 1080p?"".In those first hours i kept dying also to the worst skeletons of the tutorial, but going ahead with it it became understandable what the game wanted me to do: learn from my silly mistakes and make up a strategy on my own. The combat system is the best i've tried in my life, and it became understandable the difficoulty from the developers to create good keyboard keys to reproduce it. You'll have to block at a right timing, attack at the right timing, fall back at the right timing and dodge the hit AT THE RIGHT TIMING. You fail at one of these? You're dead, simple as that. The IA is very very clever, but it's not OP at all, you just need to ask yourself ""what does this boss want me to do?"" and you'll get it, after 20-40 times you try it. I actually found myself dying at the same boss for more than 20 times, but each time was better, untill i finally understood WHAT i was doing wrong. The good thing is that after these 20 times i wasn't bored at all, because the possibilities you have during a fight are infinite, and you'll never get tired of trying them all out! The comparison between DS and Skyrim is stupid imho: they are both epic for what they have to offer. Skyrim for its great graphics, open world, storyline, quests, MODS and a lot more; while DS for its difficoulty, replayability, combats and strategy. What is really missing on DS are strange mods like skyrims (that couldn't even be isntalled without DSfix!).I have to admit that having to install DSfix and other graphic mods to make it AT LEAST enjoyable at 1080p and 60fps is baaahd, but come on, you'll have to work on it 20 minutes to enjoy your gameplay for ever!Come on, little newbie, buy it, enjoy it and remember to NEVER EVER look on the internet cheap ways to defeat bosses, you'll feel soooo bad after having done that, trust me! :)			"

												Dark Souls is the new action role-playing game from the developers who brought you Demon’s Souls, FromSoftware. You exist in a land where the bad guys have already won – society is in terminal decline and everyone is turning into undead ‘hollows’. That’s how you start the game, but some trick of fate allows you to keep your human mind. You can even transform back into a person by obtaining ‘humanity’ from dead enemies – although it’s a rare commodity and, as you may have heard, dying is a very frequent occurrence in Dark Souls.I've played the game for around 250+ hours in order to complete all the achievements and characters' side quests. It is truly a masterpiece with an incredible story, stunning atmosphere and many gorgeous views. The world is masterfully designed, the soundtrack is amazing and the boss battles are outstanding and memorable. On top of that, one of the best features in the game is the online play - I found defeating the hardest bosses while cooperating with a friend very fun. The PvP system is really well done and I was usually able to find active players who were ready to fight - despite the game coming out 4 years go, the community is still very active and friendly. The first thing you may hear about Dark Souls is how hard it is, and while it is a very challenging game indeed, the reward for completing it or for even beating a boss is the best and biggest sense of achievement you will get out of a video game. The only reason why I wouldn't give it a perfect 100/100 is the PC port which is frustrating at first, but with a couple of downloads and mods you can fix it.In conclusion, this is one of the best and most replayable games I've ever played. If you like challenging games and are prepared to die, this is the game for you. I would recommend you play it with a controller and look through the community forums for guides if you find the game too hard for you.			"

												Dark Souls is a beautifully crafted experience in a dark fantasy setting that will challenge the player to adapt and learn from their experiences rather than be spoon fed like many modern games.The level design often creates a game of risk versus reward with the careful playcement of bonfires which serve as checkpoints where you can rest and level up your character. The question many new players will be asking themselves is weither to play it safe and go back to the bonfire and lose their progress, or to push on and risk losing their souls in hopes of finding another bonfire. Being the open world that Dark Souls is, each area connects with another logically and physically often through shortcuts opened up by the player. You can stop and look around at your distant surroundings and think to yourself, "" Ah yes, I've been to that bridge before."" and realise that each area of the game was perfectly placed with each other area in mind. This also serves the idea of experienced players being able to quickly build whatever character they want without being railroaded into a single path storyline creating replay value.Speaking of storyline, there practically isnt any. Dark Souls is a lore rich game which often will be missed by first time players creating an atmosphere of hopelessness as you go around and around not knowing where to go. This aids in the player exploring the world on their own with little direction, but can be frustrating at times for the new player. The NPCs you find are primarily venders and story tellers, but will come and go with their own agendas further showing that the world doesnt revolve around you. Dark Souls offers multiplayer in a few forms. Players can frequently see messages written by other players wishing to aid or hinder others as well as seeing ghosts and blood stains giving the impression of how others have died giving you a warning. Dark Souls also has optional co-op and pvp by recovering your humanity. Players needing help can summon phantoms to their world to help them progress and take down bosses, but this also invites enemy phantoms to try and stop you. The co-op and pvp however is totally voluntary and is not forced apon you at any time, however you cannot have one without the other excluding playing the game offline and summoning NPC phantoms.Dark Souls is an absolute must play for anyone looking for a challenge.

												We all know that this game is famed for being 'difficult' or frustrating so instead of justifying this or telling you to suck it up, I'll write about my experience of the game so far.'You Died'But in all seriousness, Dark Souls: Prepare to Die is a game I think everyone should play at least once. It is reminiscent of old style RPG top-down dungeon crawlers in it's atmosphere with the level design allowing you to cautiously make decisions in which way you want to explore. 'Left or right? What if I miss a shiny by going this way?' you know the feel. It's really refreshing to see a more modern game handle this so well.The combat however is what makes it really shine. You can't charge in and hope to obliterate everything by mashing a few buttons. Combat in this game, even against the 'trash' mobs, needs to be carefully planned. It's not forced like an RTS or turn based combat but if you don't think carefully about where and when to move, dodge and strike you will meet a bloodstainy end very quickly. While this probably sounds like less of a selling point, as you play the reward of overcoming a foe is that 'Awwyes' moment. Again, something a lot of modern games lack. It's also worth noting the class system is classic RPG style, with attributes that you level up so you can play the way you feel suits you. The threat of dying is always there and the game does a good job of keeping you on your toes. Death is more of a learning curve in Dark Souls and half the fun is running into unexpected situations or biting off more than you can chew, each encounter (and subsequent death) asks you to take a moment to think how you could have handled that better. A boss may take more than a few attempts to overcome but when you do, you are equipped for future areas of the game. At first you'll probably be resistant to this, as many games treat defeat as the final stop, not a fully integral part of the mechanics. Once you accept this though, death is pretty fun. The world, lore and atmosphere of Dark Souls is also some thing to mention. Without spoilers, the world is a dark medieval fantasy, which sounds cliche but it keeps a pretty unique feel and adds to the doomy storyline and mechanics. The creature and character design are also refreshing.Now for some not so good things. Firstly, this is a port to PC. A lazy one. It's so lazy even the tutorial messages reference Xbox controller buttons *searches keyboard for RT button* While I've been playing with keyboard for the time being I'd suggest you buy an Xbox controller. Keyboard is okay, but I spent a fair while in the starting area mentally mapping what key did what. They aren't intuitive. You'll have a better time with controller.The resolution can also be horrific on larger screens, which is a pity because the graphics are interesting. To remedy this there is an easy to install mod on Nexus, DSMfix. Almost a must have in my opinion. Overall Dark Souls is a brilliant game worthy of time and attention. It has that old style feel that many games lack and is almost worth it just for that. However, if you are the sort of gamer who gets easily frustrated or doesn't like to be challenged in a game you should probably look into it more before buying. "

												I kwnow it could a bit pretentious, or even arrogant, but i have to say: ""EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THIS GAME"" Why? Because this is what every game should be:The whole PVE gameplay is perfectly balanced (except for a single boss battle) even without a ""difficulty selector"", so no, there is no ""easy difficult""; and yes, you'll die a lot, but only when you actually deserve it,(if you find it much too hard probably you are just missing something: try to explore or try another route; or you are playing with mouse and keyboard: buy a joypad).Arts, graphic and engine good enough to make this game really good-looking, but ""light"" enough to work smoothly in older machine: a mid tier notebook is more than enough to make this game run(even though it WILL fall to 15 fps in particular circumstance, whatever configuration you adopt)In addition to the two previous consideration, you will have HUGE selection of weapon and magic, every single one of them has unique appearance, moveset and effect, making almost any playstyle peculiar AND potentially successfull in the game (except for some, obvious, joke and trap: SPOILER: don't use the dragonsword at your first playthrough)Multiplayer is very well done, except sometimes for latency in PVP (especially when players come from far different region).Except when you play offline mode and/or disconnected from the internet, you are actually playing in multiplayer, *always*, this mean: communication from and for other player (in form of orange message written on the floor), ""ghost"" appearance of other player in the same area at the same time, blood of dead players (and if you interact, you will see HOW that player is actually dead).But, before you can actually do PVP and COOP, you need to perform another operation, this secures you against unespected grief AND, at the same time, if you need external help you'll have a counterpart (BUT, if you want to HELP another players you can do coop even without ""activating"" the PVP, you only have to be patient)The only real downfall of this game is its PC-port: it is not so good (""awful"" is the right term, to be honest),BUT the community did a set for excellent workarounds for this, the only thing you need to do is: go to ""discussion"" panel read the 4 pinned discussions (especially   this one ) profitPraise the sun!

												The thing about this game is that it has ruined other games for me. You know why? Because other games don't feel as engaging or...fun. The challenging bosses and sometimes brutal ordeals isn't what defines this game-- its the cryptic storytelling, the atmosphere, the music that truly is the gem that is Dark Souls. For me this game is a testament to life itself, as it describes the countless failures (like dying in Dark Souls) one has to endure to finally hone one's skills to achieve success (like experiencing the euphoric feeling of seeing ""Victory Achieved"" after defeating a boss). So, don't be afraid to die my...son.			"

												When you first start playing this game you might want to just give up and quit. Don't. Just keep going. If you start to get mad just take a break and come back in ten minutes. This game is meant to be hard. If it was easy why would we play it? You will die....a lot. Once you get the hang of it the game is VERY fun. Still challenging but fun at the same time. This game is now number 3 on my list of favorite games. BUY IT NOW!!!!!! So with that said...prepare to die. Have fun!10/10			"

												Simply put: One of the best games I have ever played, alongside the Elder Scrolls series. The art direction, lore and player interaction are masterfully done. The amazing artstyle alone should come as no surprise from the individuals that have been creating numerous-but-unique mech designs for over a decade.The game mechanics are simple, but satisfying. Allowing you to block, parry, dodge, light attack and heavy attack your enemies. What I like about the way the game handles itself with the combat system is how methodical it forces the player to be in unevenly matched fights. A lot of the enemies can be ran past once you understand the layout of the areas, but it can still be a rather tricky endeavor because of various environmental hazards that you'll find along the way.The only true complaint I can lodge against the game mechanics are the absurdly generous input buffering for actions that usually do more harm than help. Also, be warned that since this game uses a peer-to-peer system for its multiplayer component, establishing sessions with friends or other people can turn into a frustrating ordeal.The game itself is not nearly as diverse in terms of character creation/input as something like an Elder Scrolls game, but this is more than made up for with the gripping and unique world that From have managed to create. Obscurity is a major game mechanic theme of Dark Souls, and is what makes it so much fun to play. The joy of exploring areas that you previously had believed to be thoroughly searched, only to discover a new secret hidden within its crevices. It is this sense of exploration coupled with the very macabre atmosphere that make Dark Souls a truly wonderous experience.			"

												I'm not sure I've ever spent so much time on a game I've enjoyed so little. There are some silver linings, but they all come with big black clouds attached.There's something compelling here - it's vaguely Metroid-like in how you really do feel like you're venturing into the unknown. And Dark Souls passes on the common flaws of modern cutscene-laden action games, which is nice to see. But in doing so it draws on the worst parts of old-school D&D, then adds in a few terrible design decisions on top. So at the end of the day it's just a disappointing dungeon crawler, albeit one with an sometimes-rabid fanbase.			"

												Without a doubt the most dreadful PC port I've ever seen, this should have stayed console exclusive. If you don't have a controller, there is no reason to ever buy this game, and I'm not buying an XBOX controller just to play this game. Without a controller, menus are horribly irresponsive, mouse acceleration is all over the place, and the game never looks more than 1280x720p, regardless of effects, only options are motion blur and antialiasing. Gameplay is, again, dreadful without a proper controller, developers don't bother with mouse sensitivity, so any turn will turn you 90 degrees regardless without mods and even then the game is a chore to play, you can't rebind mouse keys, game doesn't even show the computer keys, just controller keys.Even ignoring the necessity for controller (which is, frankly, inexcusable considering the game could have been much more well implemented for mouse and keyboard), the PC port is still awful, since no changes were made to accomodate PC, a painful lack of graphical options, an extremely obtuse control scheme that makes no effort to change for a PC title and instead rebinds every button in a jumble across the letter keys, badly optimized graphics, no quality change, etc. Now, the elephant in the room: Windows Live. Since June 1st, it has been impossible to go online play or save your game at all, which is, again, an inexcusable oversight for a PC port where save files can be saved on the computer. Don't trust any review before June 1st in regards to functionality, it's no longer relevant.There is no way such a slapdash port should be seen as excusable compared to a console exclusive, regardless of developer of quality, period.

												Dark Souls is a fantastic and unforgettable experience with an immersive world and innovative multiplayer components. Brilliant level design and combat mechanics are what make this game great.The difficulty in this game is often exaggerated. The game is challenging, but always fair. Whenever you die, its always your fault, not because of some cheap game mechanic. The game is not so much hard as it is punishing. Choosing to give an extra greedy hit against a boss can mean the difference between life and death. Unlike most RPGs, power in this game is more than just a numerical value, actual player skill plays a bigger part. The immersive atmosphere and the feeling of overcoming challenges are great.This game is the most incredible gaming experience I have ever had. I can remember every moment of my first playthrough, from my naive first steps, to what I felt while the credits rolled. I have never before seen a game with such thought put into it.HoweverAfter spending over 200 hours on the console version of the game, I decided to buy the game on steam. I was disappointed, the PC port is a joke. The graphical settings are extremely lacking, the vanilla game won’t run in full resolution and is capped at 30fps. The store page isn’t kidding when it says that a controller is recommended, the keyboard and mouse controls are horrible.  On top of all that, the game uses Games for Windows Live, which doesn’t let you access your save file if you are not connected to the internet.   Edit: The game has been ported to steamworks, not sure how this affects the online just yet, but at least you don't have to go through all of the GFWL account nonsense Fortunately, some of these things can be fixed with mods, DSfix does a great job of fixing most of the problems the PC port has, and DSMfix fixes the problems with the controls (I still recommend a controller though).I could go on and on about what makes Dark Souls so amazing, but this review is long enough already. If you are willing to install some mods to make it work, I would recommend this game to anyone, even to those who don’t like difficult games.			"

												Countless hours of fun and difficulty that remains even on your thousandth playthrough. I'd call it the DARK SOULS of video games for sure.Plenty of surprises for you to find, little gimmicks to avoid noob traps, and ways to hone your playstyle. Learning to parry is an absolute must in order to enjoy the game properly.Easily a 10/10 game for me.			"

												10/10This game seems to be too hard or even unfair at first, but after a few hours and the first bosses it turns out to be super fun and it rewards you for for learning its combat. + amazing combat system+ world completetely connected+ can be played multiple time due to different possible ways/ covenants+ skill-based pvp system, almost no lucky wins+ coop play gives you the opportunity to summon help if you have trouble with some areas+ great lore, although in the background (room for interpretation)+ NG+ gives you the opportunity to collect a lot of the items- almost unplayable with keyboard (only gamepad)- VERY hard to play coop/pvp with a friend, needs up to 2h to summon each other, even then no guarantee- pvp works with p2p, meaning that heavy lags can occur (lagstabs...)All in all an amazing game, completely worth buying, challenging but never unfair, hard beginning but huge learing curve!

												Dark Souls is clearly the pinnacle of storytelling in all forms of media out there. With deep, varied characters who openly express their interests and backgrounds to you without having to prod them for any information whatsoever. You play as a strong independent creatue known as Cho-Zen Ahn-Dehd, and youjust kiddingit's pretty good, doesn't hold your hand, has a vague story that you'll only gather glimpses of if you read item descriptions and talk to everyone with dialogue, and has a whacky multiplayer with horrible net codedon't read guidesdump everything into resistanceamazing chest ahead7/10 "

												Dark Souls is that one must play for any hardcore gamer (or even average gamers) for several reasons, one of them being challenging yourself to go as far as you can into this game before quitting in rage or frustration, except the game still has fine design like to make you come back.This is surely one of the hardest games out there, and simply playing it without focusing on cheesing the heck out of the game would be brag worthy.Both the PvE and PvP for this game are really good, it has always had an active community even after further installments (3 other installments, 2 if you don't count Bloodborne). You'll always find people to do co-op with or PvP against. Of course, keep in mind there's the malicious players at very early game that abuse the Soul Level system for matchmaking, and would stay at a low enough level to where they would be able to invade newbies, while they have mid-game gear, solely for the sake of picking on the newbies.More onto the PvE, this game's bosses aren't the only difficult thing, even the weaker enemies are dangerous if you think you can just rush through everything without proper gear or knowing what you're doing. The atmosphere gives you a feeling of being alone and maybe even helpless in this dark setting. Overcoming the dangers Dark Souls throws at you gives an extremely satisfying feel, for good reason, as you have managed to become good enough to just push away what used to destroy you, even if you may not have the gear to do so yet and you manage either way.Skill and patience is everything in Dark Souls. Taking the strongest weapon you have available early game through some gimmicks will not help you win. Finding a good weapon with a comfortable moveset (and is atleast the strongest or second strongest of it's weapon type) is what you need instead, so that you can kill enemies without worrying about messing up, specially since you've gotten attatched to your weapon.Replayability is also something big in Dark Souls: you'll always end up coming back at some point, and have between dozens of builds possible for your character, all dependant on what you'd prefer your playstyle to be like. All character ''classes'' can be anything in this game, the classes only determine your starting gear and stats to give you a headstart for your build. There's just a few things bad about this game and it's the networking. The game used Games For Windows Live up until some point, and has been updated to use Steam instead for the connectivity, roughly a year ago. Even then, there are clear issues with the online play like suddenly losing connection with all other players, making you unable to see other players' blood stains (death points), or not even be matched for PvP at all. There's fortunately a mod out there to fix this, and I'll provide a link for it and a few other things to improve the game's rough spots.Recommended Mods:DSFix:http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?You *need* to get this mod if you wish to improve your framerate (even unlock from 30 FPS to 60), resolution, and overall graphics level for Dark Souls. You should get it even if you do not wish to upscale the graphics, the built-in FPS lock for Dark Souls is actually unoptimized, and simply unlocking it but then using this mod's own FPS Lock on 30, grants a major performance boost. Be aware that unlocking to 60 FPS will cause animation and hitbox issues.DSCM: Wulf's DS Connectivity Modhttp://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1047/?Will improve, as the title says, the connectivity in dark souls allowing you to not simply lose connection with other players and give you the ability to connect to someone in specific like a friend of yours for co-op.Dark Souls PVP Watchdog:http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/849/?This mod will improve the matchmaking in a way that it will make sure you do not get matched with people that cheated their way up into the game, like being at Soul Level 5 but having 99 in every single stat, making them insanely overpowered. Those players will be blocked out from your connection with this mod.Another thing you could look for is SweetFX, but be warned that most presets for this kind of graphics mod mess up brightness in a way that places that are already dark will end up *pitch black* and give you a lot of trouble just to try to see what's there. And there are a lot of already pitch black areas in Dark Souls before this mod, so keep that in mind.Overall Rating: 9/10:Gameplay Rating: 9/10Music Rating: 9/10Graphics Rating: 8/10Replayability: 10/10- Nominated for ''The Test of Time'' Award. -			"

Verdict:Buy now!Buy on saleSave your money Overall Score:8.5/10Summary:I feel like Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition has been taunting me for 4 years - waiting for me to play it. I'd heard a lot about it and the hype so thought I'd experience it first hand.To critique this game is not so straightforward. There are major issues. It's a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port and you will spend your initial time downloading the DSFix 'mod' just so you can get it into a reasonably playable state. Forget about playing it on Keyboard and Mouse, unless you like extra punishment, a controller is a MUST (Steam controller worked well for me as an aside). The graphics are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (even for 2012, but remember at its core this is a last-gen console game). The absence of a tutorial or tooltips will have you alt tabbing and searching YouTube just to try and find out even the most basic of info that will be crucial to your game.Yet despite all that the game rises to be head and shoulders over the sum of its parts. Once you accept the basic premise that you are there to die and learn from your mistakes (the game even has a mechanic where you can watch other people’s death, via a ghost, by clicking on their bloodstain to help learn from their mistakes). Then you will practice and practice and finally get it right - rewarding you with extremely satisfying moments, a feeling not often found in today’s games. There is something to be said for taking on a boss 6 or 7 times then finally defeating him. It's not just a matter of doing the boss fight, it's clearing the trash every single time, occasionally losing your XP in the process, which will serve to both destroy your soul and have you punching the air in triumph when you are finally successful.Overall the game is akin to flawed genius, you know something is not quite right, the game will brutally punish your mistakes and yet it is almost because of it that you will find yourself coming back for more. I'm pretty sure this is the only game I have actually Rage Quit in the last 5 or so years.I've recommended picking up On Sale because the game has been around long enough and on sale enough times that you can save your money, add it to your wish list and then grab it at the next sale (unless of course you have a burning desire to play straight away).The Good:Brutal and satisfying gameplayCommunity support Good old fashion boss fightsSound is greatThe Bad:Can feel lost as a new player, with very little information to go onThe graphicsYou need to fix the off the shelf game (DSFix) before playing it to avoid a suboptimal experienceThe Ugly:A terrible console port, NOT supported after releaseCamera can be frustratingPro TipAlthough you may need to go to the Wiki / YouTube to get some of the basics of the game, I highly recommend you stay away from watching boss fights and reading guides - the most satisfying experience will be making your own way through the game.

Genre: Hardcore Action RPGGame Time: 60~70+ hoursThe PC port is passable. The game itself however boasts a solid combat mechanic ahead of it's time, which even in 2015 is one of the best on the market. The dialogue is minimal and the story itself isn't presented like traditional RPGs but the atmosphere just reeks of heart-crushing despair and helplessness. You can genuinely feel the fall of a civilization as you progress through the levels and see the destruction of monuments and countless fallen soldiers turned hollow.The level design is a brilliant display of craftsmanship although in the later levels you acquire the ability to warp through specific checkpoints.The colorful bosses will repeatedly destroy you until you get good to the point of not needing to rely on cheesy exploits. Fitting music too. You will scream in terror at your first encounter with the Taurus Demon while the orchestra and chorus enhances the fear of being crushed to death.Dark Souls has a crazy amount of content and great ideas executed perfectly, if not for the age of the game the full-price of $20 is a massive steal. It's multiplayer and co-op despite being released on the PC in Q3 2012, is still well alive. Of course not as lively as what it used to be but not dead to say the least.Sometimes the player count can exceed what Evolve got on average during it's free-weekend, and that game came out this year.There are so few criticisms for the game I would be nitpicking if I were to make one up. Besides it's obvious that the game had a limited budget and time constraints, but the fact that FromSoftware managed to create a game of this magnitude, is just inhuman. Seriously amazing job guys.Oh, and don't forget to install DSfix![www.nexusmods.com] "

												I don't know what to say about this game, so let's start from the beginning.I bought this game on a humble bundle just for fun and I kinda wanted to play the game for a long time.Bought a cheap controller and started playing. When I got stuck at the Gargoyle Boss, I just stopped playing for a while.Then, when I beat the bosses I had this overwhelming feeling of power and I wanted to play it more and kill more bosses.Then the game got harder and harder, but I had a system of killing bosses, but I wasn't really smart when it comes to NPCs, Blacksmiths etc... because I killed most of them without even realising the consequences.When I realised that I was ♥♥♥♥ed and I couldn't upgrade the weapons more then 5+ I thought to my self: ""Meh, ♥♥♥♥ it, I'm gonna keep playing.""But when you get further in the game, bosses really seem just like a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and they're not really that hard anymore.I just wanna say that this game is really addictive and one of my favourite games of all time ( My personal Top 10) even though I don't really play RPG games (I'm more of a FPS Guy), but I'm glad that I made an exception for this game and I'm glad that I finished it.Overall great gameplay,graphics are solid (but I don't care about that), good and challenging boss fights and well made combat gameplay.10/10			"

												This is without a doubt one of the laziest and most poorly made PC ports I've ever seen. I have a little over two hours of playtime on this port and the entirety of that time was spent trying to get it to run above 15 FPS. And that's indoors - once it gets into an open area, the framerate drops even lower. I don't have the greatest machine, true, but neither do many people - and this game isn't pretty enough to justify the demands it makes on your computer.That being said, Dark Souls remains an excellent game. Having played through the first two games I can without a doubt recommend it - just not the PC version. If you have a high-end PC with a strong CPU and don't have another system that can run this game, then maybe this is for you. Even so, you'll definitely want to get DSFix just to make the game's resolution worth it.9/10 game, 1/10 port.			"

												""It's not hard, but hard to get into"" - VaatiVidyaIs Dark Souls a hard game? Yes. Is it unfair? Mostly not. Is it impossible? Not at all. The main difficulty is how it is unfriendly to new players. You may have troubles understanding where to go, what to do, how to defeat some tough enemies, how to upgrade equipment, etc. Not gonna lie, I consulted some guides once in a while. But if you actually listen to NPCs, look at your environment, and use other players' help, everything gets much easier. The reward is astonishing. Dark Souls features unforgettable action-RPG experience, a grim but beautiful world, violent combat, unique designs, original online features (both coop and PvP), an excellent soundtrack by Motoi Sakuraba and high replayability. There are still enough players online, so you won't feel alone. The story is not a main point in the game, but it still has some great characters and side stories, however you need to look carefully not to miss them. Framerate issues at some locations and bad mouse/keyboard controls may spoil your gameplay, so a mod called DSFix and a gamepad are indispensable.Overall, I liked the game very much. To tell the truth, it took me several attempts to get used to it, but it was worth it.9/10			"

												This game is good in the same way in the same way that aloe is good after a sunburn: you enjoy brief periods of respite between the annoyance that is most of the actual game.I will agree that the game is well designed and the controls are actually pretty crisp, but that doesn't make up for the rest of it. Or maybe a better analogy would be that it seems like the game designers don't like the people that play their games and they are metaphorically spitting in their faces by making this game.Start the game walk in any direction...dieFigure out where you're supposed to go...dieMake it super far into a new area, meet boss. Die immediately. Spend 7 minutes and 20 seconds (actually timed) getting back to the same place that you were at. Die. Repeat. Die. Repeat. Win. Move on to next area.Find new type of enemy. They cursed you. Die slowly.Before you get back to new enemy. Get restless and sloppy with easy enemies. DIE (even the average enemy of your level can 3 or 4 shot kill you within the space of maybe 2 seconds). Lose all you souls.I wouldn't be so bothered by this game, but I was expecting it to at least be fair. If you mess up you pay, but the majority of your death is just guess and check. OH this enemy has some move that I couldn't have predicted without dying that can one shot me. That happens over and over and over.All of that stuff being said, the game is relatively fun, but I usually can't stand to play it for more than maybe half an hour before it bothers me too much to continue.

												So, recently I bought this casual game called ""Dark Souls: Prepare to Lag"" edition. But when I tried to play it, I suddenly heard the low voice behind me, it whispered something like: ""oh hey buddy, you wanted to play? No, first you should install the ""Windows Live"" or you won't be able to save the game"". ""Yes, my lord,"" - I answered, and did what the voice asked. ""Good! But I see LIVE doesn't work on your Windows 8, try to get some updates."" So I did. Then I launched the game again, but the resolution was quite low and only on the half of my monitor. ""AHAHAH! poor PC-baby! - the voice was laughing on me, - Well, don't worry, you'll just have to find another fix, it's nothing so hard, isn't it?"". I googled some stuff and started Dark Souls with it, but it crashed. I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, while the voice continued, this time in my head: ""Oh boy, you just forgot to turn off the AA. Also, if you don't wanna play with 30 fps, you should get another patch. And don't forget to install a few more fixes for mouse and keyboard. Plus, you should..."". THAT'S IT, - I screamed, - ENOUGH! THAT'S THE HARDEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED, I CAN'T EVEN LAUNCH IT. SHUT UP ALREADY, YOU HEAR ME? LEAVE ME ALONE, I DON'T WANT TO  PLAY YOUR STUPID GAME ANYMORE, PLE.... The door in my room opened. My mom found me screaming on the floor without pants, crying and fapping at the same time. ""You're just like your father,"" - she said. A strong cold wind was gently touchung my butt, I smilled and fell asleep. I was finally happy.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. Almost everything is perfect, but port is not. Although, it's fixable with a mod(dsfix), luckily.Anyway, beautiful, challenging, with an awesome atmosphere, really cool fighting system and neat rp mechanics. If you wanna something more challenging but still as exciting as, let's say, Skyrim, you SHOULD definitely play it. (also much more awesome dragons)Sorry for me english, me no speek London "

												Making list of reasons why ds was so ♥♥♥♥ed up this big is too hard so instead you get this.SPOILER ALERTSolaire of Astora can't find his ""sun"", his only reason to not go hollow so he puts on a fancy shining maggot hat and laughs like a madman.Siegmeyer of Catarina loses his only reason to keep his humanity, slowly loses it and finally gets killed by his own daughter.Sieglinde of Catarina travels half of earth only to kill her father second time.Sad warrior is sad. (loses all his hope and does not like big snake so much that he goes hollow)Rhea of Thorolund gets betrayed by Petrus of Thorolund, loses her escort, maybe even then get killed by Petrus and finally gets abducted by Seath and goes hollow, while struggling to find her place in the world. Queelag of Izalith tries to save her sister by killing and getting humanity off every intruder of her domain and gets killed by main hero.Fair Lady sucks poison of her servants so they don't die, suffers in agony and slowly dies herself after that.Dark Sun Gwyndolin have both breasts AND mans bazooka.Anastacia of Astora gets killed by Embraced Lautrec than gets revived by chosen undead, hopes that curse will break if chosen undead uses himself as a firewood, but that is not the case.Shiva of the East is pretty much like Solaire, but he finds what he seeks (chaos blade) and than goes mad.Witch of Izalith tries to replicate the First Flame but instead gets consumed by the fire, thus creates demons and becomes Bed of Chaos (these shining balls is her daughters and one of the demon bosses in Izalith is her son).Pinwheel is a creature made of family, literally.Artorias tries to stop Abyss spreadingin Oolacile but fails to do so because he protects his friend, puppy Sif and gets devoured by the Abyss.Great Grey Wolf Sif - saved by the main hero he then protects the ring of Artorias so no one will die like him only to get killed by main hero.AND MANY MORE. I will add reasons to the list when i will come up with any anything new (i probably won't)			"

												On your hero's journey to become a better gamer, nay, an objectively superior person, Dark Souls is your personal '80s training montage. It needs no tacked-on Achievements system, because every bit of meaningful progress you make is an achievement in itself. It needs no difficulty levels, because, like any rewarding video game, it starts on Very Hard, progresses to Insane (or, in Touhou parlance, ""For Weird People"",) and then smooths out to Hard mode once you've gotten the hang of it, which comes with the satisfying moment in which you realize you're ready for whatever comes ahead.You either outsmart the game, or you take a break and come back swinging after you have one of the many eureka moments you'll experience. You'll initially have a hard time figuring out how to be a smart♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and beat the baddies of Lordran at their own game, but in doing so, you will unleash the inner fighting spirit you had all along. Dark Souls is not just an inventive and engrossing game that makes a strong case for the evolution of games into an art form. It's not just a brilliant marriage of East and West game design values. It's also a teaching tool. Dark Souls will teach you to be cautious and aware of your environment, and the consequences of failure (namely through the Humanity system and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ basilisk curses.) Dark Souls encourages cooperation and compassion for your fellow players. You can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and leave false post-its for other players, and/or gank them mercilessly to rob them of Humanity, but you really get a ""we're all in this together"" kind of feeling with the way the game rewards cooperation, assistance, and hunting down merciless invaders. It plays great, makes you feel like a badass, contains Berserk references, and is a brilliant example of environmental storytelling. And damn, those environments. What a gorgeous view.If you don't give Dark Souls a fighting chance (at least 10 hours of tryhard playtime,) you're an overgrown, stinky, pouting, grimacing, liliputian, whiny, poopy, little velcro-sneaker-wearing tyke. If you've given it a fair shot and don't like it yet, don't worry. You've proven you have the Guts to rise to the challenge. When you're ready. But harden your heart. You will get there, but it won't be easy. Prepare to die.A+			"

												One of the greatest games of this generation (one of my favorites). Despite playing almost 1000 hours and doing more than 20 playthroughs, i still keep coming back to it. Most of the fun is trying new builds, using diferent weapons and armor, which makes the replay value very high. The RPG elements are very good and combat is great (buy a ps3 or 360 controller). With the mods that can be installed for pc it's even better (especially graphics mods). This game is a must buy and it's still time to pick it up. If you didn't buy it on flash sale by now, you should've. To finish off: i don't want you go to hollow.			"

												Prepare to die over and over again. Prepare to lose all your progress, and sometimes your will. But also prepare for a journey through a scarred and forgotten land, of figures from a past guiding you forward on what seems to be your destiny. You have the choice in this game to give in to death, and hollow. Or to fulfill your destiny as the chosen. If you enjoy thrilling combat with punishing but fair difficulty based on your own skill as a player then this game is for you.			"

												Wow. Just... wow. This game has become one of my favorites of all time. It's not without flaws, though. I seriously reccomend having a controller, downloading and installing DSFix and DSCFix, and keep your PvP builds in summon/invade range of level 125. Buy this game ASAP, the fun and difficulty will have you engaged for days.Edit: While DS2 feels like a better experience in some aspects, this game is a much better entry point than 2 or Demon's Souls.

												Dark Souls.Spiritual successor to the Playstation 3 exclusive Demon Souls, with a well deserved reputation for being a brutal game. Dark souls is often touted as being ""NES hard"" compared to the hand-holding games of the modern generation, by the way the game implements hard but fair gameplay. The 3rd person fantasy RPG features a plethora of weapons to cater to a varity of different playstyles and a large world to explore.The game opens with a cinematic that gives the player a history of the first flame and souls, but the rest is left to the player to interpret and discover.Throughout the inter-connected world of Lordran you will find bonfires that restore your healing items (Estus Flasks) whenever you rest at them. The implementation of limited heals creates this 'risk vs reward' aspect to adventuring, where if you run out of your charges, you can either press on towards a new bonfire, or return to the old one to give it another go. The Bosses in Dark Souls are brilliantly crafted and offer both test of the players combat knowledge, figuring out the attack patterns, timing your attacks and healing, as well as the crawl back to the boss from bonfires testing your knowledge of the level.One minor gripe with Dark souls, is that lag can heavily effect gameplay in certain areas causing annoying deaths and damage. This happens rather rarely, as to not majorly affect the games otherwise good controls.All in all, Dark souls is an amazing game that is tough but fair giving a rich fantasy RPG experience to anyone who picks it up.Praise the sun!

												Renowned for being difficult and for good reason.  This game will test your patience as it throws you into a dark, dying world with little explanation and almost no equipment.  You will die.  You will die a lot.  But out of all the death comes understanding of the game.  And with understanding comes satisfaction.  Eventually the bosses will start to drop.  And someday you may understand what all the numbers in the menu mean.  Don't feel bad looking up guides to help you if you're super confused.  Better than quitting I say.  But don't let it do the work for you.  And don't spoil anything!  Discovery is the name of the game!This game has an excellent setting and even better enemy design.Praise the sun!P.S. Subpar port to PC.  There are several mods out there to help make the game run better.  Please PM me if you need help.  Absolutely worth it.			"

												Preaching to the choir a bit, but man, this game is pretty great.I'm going to save time and just give the cliff notes since I think everything has pretty much already been said otherwise.+ Lots of content. So many puzzles, weapons, spells, monster types, upgrade paths, shortcuts and secrets, everything! The game is ♥♥♥♥ing /packed/.+ Lots of variety. So many interesting locales. I'm almost wondering what they'll do for the sequel to spice it up since so many ideas have already been used. Maybe a blizzard area or a desert.+ It feels like a fantasy come to life. Interesting lore, fitting dialogue and voice acting. It's all so well realized.+ A very small number of reskins. Game feels fresh from start to finish.+ Rewarding. The boss fights are each like a puzzle which often trouble you the first go around but even simply give 1 retry and you can feel how you've improved. - Some things are a bit obtuse. Like, it's not clear why one would want to stock humanity points without looking it up. It feels safer to just keep the humanity items pocketed.- Wish there was better item management. You get a lot of items. For instance, I think identical weapons and armors should stack if you have multiples. Looking forward to Dark Souls 2!			"

												I'm going to write a serious review because I'm sick of seeing the ""11/10 there was a butt"" nonsense.It's a good game but it has it's flaws. I'd recommend it and I rate it 8/10. If you are looking for a challenging RPG that doesn't require grinding or deep deep levels of thought towards stats. If you enjoy hard boss fights that act as an exam on the game mechanics and enemies that will put up a fight, then this game is for you.Good:+The difficulty is not only offers a sense of challenge but also a sense of fear that any enemy can kill you if you dismiss it. It is mostly fair with one or two instances where it just gets silly, but that rarely happens. The feeling inside when you see a new type of enemy is a strangly good sense of fear and dread, wondering if they'll just up and one shot you, or explode or eat you is a weirdly great feeling.+The atmosphere is pretty depressing and dark which fits perfectly for the game.+World design is very good, the world not only is well connected but it aesthetically seems well connected. There is a vast array of areas that are extremely different, yet feel perfectly connected to each other.+Majority of the boss fights are fair, but only some are extremely hard (IMO). If you don't mess around and be serious you can smash most bosses. When you defeat a boss that you are having trouble on it is one of the best feelings leaving you wanting to play more.+Combat is very well designed. It's simple and easy to understand and once you get into the zone you will love just going from A-B because of the fantastic combat.+The multitude of ways to play makes the game replayable and diverse. You are also not locked into one class, you can level up into any stats you want leaving it open for unique play.+Story is interesting but quite shallow, it just left me wanting more of a story and I guess that's a sign of a good story that wasn't fleshed out enough.+PVP can be fun but it's too heavily affected by lag making it unfun and obtrusive, but this could just be a personal problem with lag so I'm adding it as a plus.+The RPG elements are easy to follow and understand, making it easy for you to get the most out of your character.Bad:-Controls can be a bit clunky, making the roll and jump the same button is terrible design, especially when there is no move    assigned to L3/Left thumbstick.-The port and GFWL make it pretty annoying to use, but this can easily be ignored-As for story, it's interesting but it's pretty shallow. Dark souls fans will always make note of how the story must be found and searched for, this is true. If you look for story and lore you will find it, but, when you do look into it you hit a brick wall quickly. There is a very small amount of background information in the game. Through the game I was super interested in the story, wondering who is this guy and what's his story, and I'd be met with 2 sentences about him. Also, too much of this lore is speculation and it's extremely vague. It's good to leave some things up to interpretation, but god. Not this much.-Bad possibly even the worst fanbase. This fanbase enjoys talking down to every other RPG over the casual pastime they enjoy, they refute any claims of bad game design (major or minor), claiming that it would literally ruin the game and they are just generally mean spirited towards anyone who doesn't like the game or has a genuine criticism. It's best to just avoid them and their elitism. "

												For those whom haven't ever played a souls game before, then please read this. For those that have, and haven't played Dark Souls PTDE, then it's imperative you read this.Firstly, for those that don't know, Dark Souls is the first in a trilogy of games that boasts ever growing popularity as they are released, and is the best introduction into Souls games you will receive - gritty, bitter, soul crushing disappointment... followed by frustration, determination, perseverance and eventually insatiable lust. Yes, this is not a nice game, but it has the potential to be the best.Now, whilst you may have heard of the spiritual predecessor, Demon's Souls, and spiritual successor, Bloodborne; know that while they share similar mechanics, these game are not part of the Dark Souls trilogy, and shouldn't wholly determine whether you'll think you'll like this game - which they haven't otherwise you wouldn't be reading a review to make up your mind...START HERE IF YOU ONLY CARE FOR THE WORTHWHILE STUFF ::I'll start out by saying, this game isn't for the feint of heart. If you don't like difficulty, or you're not patient, or you think Skyrim can be hard... this isn't for you. I can tell you, I've played that crap with survival mods on legendary difficulty and all it does is bore me. Dark Souls brings difficulty and mixes it with ingenuity to create a whole new kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tearing experience for the new player. But, it is a game that can be mastered, and within no time it shall be the player tearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... of newbs... using twink builds - because we're all sadists at heart.Since we're on that topic, let's talk about combat. Dark Souls has one of the best, and most advanced combat systems of any RPG out there - easily combating that of Dragon's Dogma and other such games. FromSoftware has placed heavy focus on a mixture of tactical and reactive combat. One can win a fight using reflexes alone, but the game punishes you for not planning ahead. The player whom prepares properly, and learns their enemy, will find themselves breezing through most areas and bosses in no time.Stamina management is a key feature in Dark Souls. Stamina, shown as a green bar on the top left corner of one's HUD, determines the players ability to dodge, attack, block, parry, sprint, jump and at times can even affect the speed and damage of one's attacks. It is infinite, in that it recharges over time, but poor management can lead to a temporary loss of stamina, leaving the player wide open, and 90% of the time will result in death, or something close to it. Always be wary of your stamina.That aside, the combat system in Dark Souls is very complex. From 'sweet spot' attacks, which alter damage dealt depending on which part of your weapon strikes the enemy; to differing types of critical attacks, and the various damage types the game has on offer. One of the 'unseen' but easily recognised features of the game are enemies' weaknesses and resistances. While certain enemies will be weak to thrusting or slashing damage, they may be resistant to striking attacks... and vice versa. This same rule applies to the elemental types available in the game :- Magic- Fire- Lightning- Physical (which splits into Strike, Slash and Thrust)And on top of that are status effects :- Bleed - Poison- ToxinThis complex and diverse combat system allows almost infinite variety to every combat situation. Of course, certain things will work better against certain enemies, bosses, or even are better suited to the area (for example, using a smaller thrusting sword in a confined space yields better results than accidentally hitting the wall with your two-handed skyscraper)'I don't want to pour out a wiki full of content on a mere review, so I won't go too into detail about everything that I have mentioned and chosen to omit.Now, aside from basic combat, Dark Souls PTDE boasts some of the best boss fights in any game to date. This that have played other souls games can be prepared for on par and better boss fights than many of the best fights encountered in the Souls games, and Dark Souls 1 is home to the most renowned and notorious boss fight in the whole series (and one of the biggest souls memes) - so that should persuade you a bit.For those that haven't played a souls game... well, prepare to die. It's in the title. Many of the bosses in this game will kill you. Many times over. It is the player's responsibility to learn the boss - their move set, their weaknesses and strengths, and to learn to be patient with it. Greed, impatience and thoughtlessness are the biggest enemies of the Dark Souls player. As I said, if you aren't patient, then it isn't for you.Saying that, I do not wish. To imply, at all, that any boss in this game is boring and just a grind to do. Quite the opposite. Every boss, to me, in their own unique way is a fight to behold. Each will get your heart racing, as you battle epically against bosses a varying size and shape, from humanoids the size of you, to beasts the size of buildings, all accompanied by an astounding soundtrack - it will not disappoint... well, maybe one boss fight will, but we don't talk about that one.Though it was the first thing I spoke about, Combat is not the most important thing about Dark Souls (well it might be to some), but to me, the defining aspect of this game is the design. Set in a dark, fantastical, medieval setting - Dark Souls sets the player in one of the most flawlessly designed worlds to be seen in an RPG. The interconnected world, which intertwines on itself, with twists and turns at every corner leading to new and exciting areas as often as the well needed relief of realising it was a shortcut back to your last bonfire (effective checkpoint), will leave most in awe of just how flawlessly created this masterpiece is.The world itself is fully connected, with each area having a realistic and very visible geographical relation to one another. Most often, that place you see in the distance is somewhere you will travel later; and there's a peculiar sense of satisfaction in seeing the place you earlier surpassed off in the distance, and realising how far you've come since.Disregarding that, the area design (each area is interconnected, but have their own names and environments) is absolutely top-notch. With various paths in each area, and an abundance of verticality almost everywhere you travel, the player will often find themselves stumbling upon surprises of both the good and bad variety... good usually comes after defeating the bad surprise though. Sorry. No reward without sacrifice. Alongside this, Dark Souls puts heavy focus on both the sense of relief and sense of accomplishment, and it's area design is something that does this very successful. Bonfires, a place where one may rest and replenish Estus, level up, and later use to fast travel (plus more), are scattered about the world - though scarcely. Areas focus on these bonfires, using shortcuts to provide the much needed relief to the player after their gruelling trek through an area. Some, however, are well hidden, so ensure you always fully explore every nook and cranny... but don't let your guard down. Dark Souls rewards exploration, but it also has its fair share of methods to stop you getting all its loot for free - watch your back, and shield up when rounding corners.Now, with both combat and design vaguely covered, the next subject is narrative. Often the biggest complaint about Dark Souls is its lack of a compelling story, and lore. Well, to those that believe such lies, I slap you with a dirty dishcloth and tell you to roll up hill donning the Catarina Armour until you are dizzy enough to warrant thinking such things, at which point I will still say you are a fool. Dark Souls has an immensely complex, emotional and amazing storyline. I freaking ran out of space, so you'll just have to believe me. \[+]/			"

												\ |T| /Metroidvania-like exploration. Easy-to-learn, hard-to-master, not-too-bad-to-get-fairly-okay-at combat. A world with a complex history and obfuscated fate, and characters with more depth than they let on.First, the good.Dark Souls is known to be ""hard"" or sometimes even ""unfair"". I strongly disagree with the use of those terms. Challenging, yes, certainly.A lot of modern games featurea hell of a lot of hand-holding. Lengthy tutorials, excessive hints, storytelling like you're listening to teacher read from a book.Dark Souls has none of these things.Dark Souls respects its players enough to let them figure out how the world works on their own.People who are used to the handholding may find themselves utterly lost in the world of Lordran - this is a perfect opportunity to get back into the old-school 'explore places and try things' mindset.The key to getting through Dark Souls alone is a matter of keeping to a mindful approach. Keep an eye out for items. Always be prepared for combat. Listen carefully to what the NPCs have to say; they drop subtle hints about where you can or need to go, what the backstory is about, and it is important to note that they do NOT repeat the more important things they say.Don't worry though - missing dialogue won't stop you from advancing. Not at all. The dialogue is merely there to aid your understanding of your purpose and the world you are in. None of the lore is forced upon you, save for the single opening cutscene which explains little but hints at a lot. In fact, the lore is carefully hidden away, waiting to be discovered and puzzled out by anyone who would seek it.Gameplay-wise, it feels clunky to start with, as all the unfamiliar options and weapons are open to you to be found, and/or left strewn across the world without ceremony. Soon enough, though, the controls will feel nothing short of intuitive, and this *includes* the option of playing with keyboard only (look up the keyboard controls in a guide and give them a go. Dark Souls does not *require* a controller, as such).Dark Souls respects your ability to learn how to deal with the obstacles it presents, and that applies to every detail. The greater part of advancing in Dark Souls is less about leveling up and more about your own personal skill, which you'll find will naturally develop as you play the game. When you beat a boss, or even any minor foe, you'll feel the satisfaction of knowing it was your own skill that overcame it. The fact that you happen to be level 258 or so is merely a small aid, and adds a side dish of a sense of personal progress.It is in fact entirely possible to beat the game whilst being level 1.Don't try that for your first run.On the whole, the positive aspects of Dark Souls outshine what I have previously called the pinnacle of my gaming experience by a long shot. If you adore adventure, exploration, skill-based combat, atmospheric environments, deep story, and RPG elements, or any combination of at least two of those, this game is for you.Next, the bad.Uh.Well, the tutorial's just a little bit cruel to less experienced gamers. Not too much so, though. Again, learn from things and you'll be fine.Sometimes it is possible to get lost or stuck somewhere, if you missed a door or a key for example, and you may be forced to bring in either the help of spoiler-riddled guides, or a trusted friend. Though Jolly Cooperation is in no way a bad thing; you might even find it enhances the atmosphere in some cases.The voice acting is merely passable. Barely even that, really. Dark Souls features a good lot of talented voice actors, but what may have been poor direction has left a lot of their lines sounding a bit.. theatrical. Not that it matters so much; there's all too many things to make up for that in the feel of the game itself.Also, some storylines pertaining to some of the characters nearly brought me to tears. That was unexpected. But a good sign of immersion!On the whole, Dark Souls definitely has some rough edges. But then I've never found a true work of art that didn't.Come for the challenge, stay for the delightful immersion into the strange, unusual world, and in thine exodus from the Undead Asylum, thou better damn well Praise the Sun.

												Reminiscent of old-school gaming, Dark Souls is brutally unforgiving. It's fair though and 99% of your, frustratingly frequent, deaths will be due to your mistakes. When you clear one of the diverse and sometimes breath-takingly beautiful sections, another of the crazy and imaginative boss fights or find a secret area or piece of lore (of which the game hints at and can be delved into quite deeply if you so wish) you feel an immense sense of satisfaction and achievement. Interesting and exciting multiplayer opportunities (shame about Windows Live though), done in quite a unique way is thrown in too.Most modern gaming has automatic transition. Dark Souls is fully manual and you'll stall many times. But once you can smoothly drive you will feel like you're king of gaming.BUY THIS GAME.			"

This games requires that you have ability and persistence, and if you have those, you will be rewarded with a pure and perfect gameplay and exploration.Dark Souls is a MASTERPIECE, a game that has challenge, atmosphere, gameplay, exploration, all this, on the perfect dosage.

												You're going to hate it for about an hour, then you will realize the following:The game is punishing, but rewarding.  You die a lot, but you lose nothing.  Every death is meant to be a learning experience.  After you get over this you can see that the combat is beautifully in depth.  The game world is amazing and seemlessly connected.  The atomsphere is amazing.  Everything about the game after getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you a few times is amazing and created beautifully.  Yes its hard, but the difficulty is rewarding, and everything you do in game feels satisfying.  Some tips:1.  Use a controller.  Sorry KB+M purists its just better.2.  Until you get good at abusing invuln frames on rolling use your shield liberally.  A good shield can block all but magic damage.3.  Weapon Upgrade >  Character levels.  A halbred + 5 will get so much done whereas 5 more levels are marginal at best.			"

												Well, the title says a lot. You will die: a lot. However, you will savor every death as you struggle to improve your own abilities and survive in the oppressive world that From Software has created. The greatest achievement of Dark Souls, to me, is that it treats you like an adult. It does not hold you hand, it does not force endless tutorials or make you follow some generic NPCs as you mow down waves of unnamed brown dudes. No, Dark Souls let you jump into the action rather quickly and teaches you everything you need to know from the getgo in a very unobtrusive manner. Combat is a struggle as you try to read the enemies' attack patterns and react accordingly with your own moves. If you play it like a traditional hack and slash, you will die and go nowhere. Therefore, everything becomes a game of balancing aggression and defense as you learn when to engage, how to engage, when to evade, and when to block. If this sounds complex, that's because it is. Dark Souls will suck up numerous hours of your time with all of its nuances and secrets. But the one glaring blemish on an otherwise fantastic experience is the PC port. To be blunt, it's just not very good. It's a very barebones port that utilizes very little of the aspects that we love about PC gaming. However, DSFix largely ameliorates many of these issues, allowing you to play the game at a higher resolution and higher framerate, making it the definitive version of the game. Games For Windows Live, unfortunately, exists in this game and is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ You'll be disconnected from LIVE in the middle of an epic boss fight (it happened to me on the Bell Gargoyles the first time around) and kicked back to the title screen or have save data deleted because GFWL uses a primitive patching system that serves as a massive inconvenience. The keyboard controls, while functional (especially with community fixes) are far from optimal. You'll definitely want a controller for this game. Finally, the game can chug at times even on a high end rig, so don't expect a perfectly smooth experience.However, despite all of that, Dark Souls is a fantastic game. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best games I've played in a very long while. The sense of accomplishment you feel as you claw your way through its brutal world or fend off hostile monsters that can easily kill you is practically uncontested. Most importantly, Dark Souls respects YOU as a player and does not baby you or insult your intelligence. It's a truly refreshing experience and one that most gamers should pick up, provided they're willing to overlook a lackluster port.			"

												This game is REALY REALY HARD. You wont be able to keep your sanity without a walkthrough so here it is:First off, when you launch the game, nothing happens, so you have to download a fix for it. Then when you try to install the fix you fail because you have 3 instances of the game running in the background due to your previous tries of launching it. Close the game running in the background and install the fix.Ok So, you now have the game running, well, ♥♥♥♥you because this game requires Games for Windows live and if you dont have it the game will not save for some reason. Now go on and download the gfwl setup from the microsoft website and install it, go far enough until you find an error saying that you have no connection to the internet. Now go to properties and run the setup in compatibility mode and also as an administrator even though you are already the only user on your personal computer. You are now able to go a bit further in the instalation but then a wild error apears... To use gfwl you need the live sign-in assistant, so there you go again to the microsoft website to download the assistant. After you run it, go back to the gfwl instalation. Since you are dealing with microsoft software, you will get the same error. You are now trapped  in a labyrinth of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ software and bad pc ports so you will have to find another way arround. After some google searches you realize you wasted too much time with this♥♥♥♥♥♥and you give up. In the final cutscene you see microsoft and namco bandai collecting all the souls of gamers (along with their wallets).I wanted a hard game to play, and thats what i got.9 steve ballmers out of 14 skyrims			"

												Great game, worst... port... ever.... I feel ripped off. Don't even consider buying this game on PC unless you enjoy massive lag all the time, a visible mouse cursor in the center of the screen, hyper-sensitive camera and a games for windows live overlay. The game itself doesn't mention it, but it absolutely requires an XBOX controller, otherwise it's simply unplayable (unless you use some of the fan made patches, it helps a little bit but not enough to save this poor excuse for a port) Later I bought this game on PS3 and it was one of the greatest games ever! Do yourself a favor and don't ever get this game on PC.One of the first issues I encountered was during the tutorial. I couldn't do something as simple as looting a body that was lying on the floor.

												I honestly wanted to like this game. At first it seems like a refreshingly tough action-RPG. However, the elements that make this game so hard aren't great enemy AI and challenging gameplay, but repetative and frustraiting mechanics that seem like they're creating just to make this game so difficult. There's a reason modern games have adopted frequent checkpoints - restarting areas again and again is more  annyoing than fun. Losing what you'd spent the last fourty minutes farming because one enemy managed to pull off a suprise combo just makes me wondering why I'm devoting free time towards something that feels like work. Watch some of the boss battle guides on youtube - most of them direct you to use some kind of exploit to win instead of describing a strategy to use to actually beat the boss fairlly. That's because most of the fights consist of blocking/countering again and again...that's it.			"

Dark Souls no matter the platform you play it on suffers from major frame rate issues alongside other graphical problems, the pc port being no exception. The game is tough to run and the frame rate gets terrible in some places (Blighttown) .. but!You can download a unofficial patch that's totally safe for steam that fixes these issues called dsfix (disable anti aliasing)DSFIX link here - http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?It basically gives you access to a more advanced configuration settings (ini file) removes the frame limiter (normally 30 || <30)Its an absolute must for Dark Souls.If you're getting Dark Souls for PC, it IS the definitive version of the game, provided you patched it.

												Great game. It's not really the kind of game where you join up with a bunch of people and fight waves of monsters, it's more like you're one of the last people on the planet, everyone else is either undead or becoming undead, and every once in a while you can have the opportunity to join up with another player like you.The game is locked at 30fps, but you can unlock it with a mod. Supposedly it's a bit buggy at 60fps, but I've never bothered to try it. Dark souls is an RPG, you level up as you collect souls, you choose what stats to level etc. The contols are simple and within an hour or so you should have them down. This game shines in the customization department. There are tons of weapons and pieces of gear that can allow you to play whatever you feel like, even if you feel like playing some sort of green-skinned monster, you can do it. The game world is lots of fun to go through, because it's all interconnected. There are no loading screens as you walk from one place to another, the entire world is essentially a labyrinth, and it is quite satisfying to discover all the connecting points and shortcuts throughout.Personally I think what sets dark souls apart is the feeling of intimidation you get when you see a monster 10 times your size, and realize that you have to find a way to kill it before moving on. It's a challenge, based largely on trial and error combined with skill, it is not for those who want to be spoon fed an interactive story. As frustrating as dark souls can be, it matches it and sometimes exceeds it with the feeling of accomplishment.			"

												This game is the most satisfying game I have ever played to date. I highly recommend it to people who like games that will immerse you in the games world 100% and make you feel like your characters success is your success. When anything and everything can turn out to be an enemy or trap you will be kept on the edge of your seat for your entire play through. Throughout the course of that play through you will encounter next to imposable boss battles and relentless environments that will test your wits and sanity. However every time you conquer one of those ‘impossible’ boss battles the sensation is next to imposable to describe but the sound you’ll make may be something like this “gaaAAAFFFF-aahhhh-YES!!” as you either jump out of your chair throwing your hands and flailing your feet or slump back in your seat and let out a sigh of relief. Either way you will have felt like you’ve leaped over Mount Everest 300 thousand times over and high-fived the heavens. The environments in this game may seem like an impossible feat at times, and maybe a little unfair if you don’t watch what you’re doing or where you step, because that thought will always be in the back of your mind like it was mine when you only have 25% health and but a single estus flask left. “I have to fight a boss after this!?” But worry not future warrior for once you embark on this journey the one thing that will raise your spirits possibly more than conquering the bosses, avoiding booby-traps, exploring enormous landscapes and finding rare loot. “What could be better than all those things?” you may ask. I have but two words for you. The Bonfire. The bonfire is the light at the end of your monster filled tunnel, it is what keeps you going and what keeps you sane, it is your savior and your home, it brings relief and peace of mind in a chaotic world. This is a journey that in my book ranks above all others because it is a real ‘do it yourself’ kind of game that does not walk you through the game like a diaper baby, oh no. In this world you may enter as a naïve wanderer but you will leave a seasoned veteran who feels like they have the world in the palm of their well armored hands, that “this game wasn’t so hard, I bet I can do it again no problem” as you chuckle to yourself. Well Dark Souls will take you up on that, several times over in fact. Conquering this adventure once was by no means and easy feat but should you have the resolve and will for it, have another go at it, only this time lets amp it up and make every single thing two times stronger and seemingly a thousand times more deadly. Every time it gets harder but simultaneously more and more satisfying. Dark Souls will take you to the brink of death and then shotgun you to success if you have what it takes. If you think you do, than dive into the madness and delight. Just, press, start.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. A flawed masterpiece, but a masterpiece none the less. It does not hold your hand at all, and is brutally difficult.  But that is not what makes this game so amazing. The atmosphere, lore, and tragic characters combined with great (but flawed) gameplay makes for one of the greatest games of all time. If I had to vote for a game of the generation, the only other game I would consider besides this is its sequel. The feeling of struggling through a once great kingdom fallen to ruin is something that only the Souls series has excecuted this well. This game will be remembered as one of the few that can truly be considered art. 10/10.			"

												This challenging fantasy action RPG throws you into a world where little can be taken at face value. The story is told in small conversations with NPCs and in item descriptions & placement. Incredible detail has been put into everything about this game which has a large community that regularly put out additional content (lore videos) that help expand a player's perception of characters. The combat is responsive and hinges of a huge variety of weapons, armour, and spells which really shines when you start playing online (and seeing all the crazy builds other people have come up with).There are some technical hiccups however, with the biggest being the GfWL DRM causing some issues with the innovative co-op/PVP aspect of the game. GfWL is also set to go down at some time in 2014, so hopefully the game will be patched to use Steam to handle the multiplayer in the future.In summary: this is a brilliant game, but a terrible port. If you can see past the technical issues, install the DSFix, and have a controlpad to hand, you may just fall deeply in love with this game.			"

												Dark Souls; the game with an infamous reputation.When it first released, I was skeptical as to whether I wanted to buy a game that had a reputation for being harder than trying to break into Fort Knox. So, as a result, I avoided buying it. However, in the summer of this year (2015), I decided, why the hell not?  During the Summer Sale I bought it for roughly £7. (I forgot the specific price.) I can safely say now, after clocking up almost 300 hours on Dark Souls, and counting, that the purchase was absolutely worth it. So, let's get some context shall we? (There's a lot of context, so be warned!)[Also! Dark Souls likes to follow the story-telling method of not telling you the story; if you want to know the lore, you've got to go research it!]~Set in a pseudo-medieval fantasy world, the game explains that long before the present time, the world was grey, ultimately rocky and dusty and covered by huge 'Arch Trees'. This world was ruled over by the 'Everlasting Dragons' ; aptly named because they were immortal. At this time, there was no light or dark; no life or death in the world, only the Everlasting Dragons.~At some point in this world, Fire was born (The game doesn't really explain how, so run with it) and from this flame was born four 'Lord Souls' (Souls in the game, act as a sort of power source for magic and the like, as opposed to being a representation of one's personality.) Three of these souls were found by the 'Lords', a race of humanoid creatures that would later become the 'Gods' of the world, while the fourth was found by the 'Furtive Pygmy', who is widely believed to have been the ancestor of Mankind/The first Human. (I'm not going to explain this story arc; go look it up if you wish to know more.) ~The Lords rebelled against the Everlasting Dragons, and using their one weakness (lightning-based magic), peeled apart the stone scales that gave the Dragons their immortality. (Without their scales, the Everlasting Dragons are not immortal) The Lord's succeeded, The Dragons were wiped out (supposedly) and this ushers in an 'Age of Fire'; where light and dark, life and death are brought into the world.~Now, in between then, and the game start, there's a lot of lore that I won't go into (Again, go research the lore; It's really worth it), but it's safe to say that the Age of Fire began to dwindle and the power of the 'Gods' began to crumble.~Fast forward to the present, the world is but a shadow of its former self; with both Kingdoms of the Lords and Human Kingdoms lying in complete desolation. This is because of the 'Curse of Undeath', a condition that replaces death with a form of immortality. However, the reason why it's called a curse is because those who are Undead with no purpose and no motivation/will to live will 'go Hollow', wherein they lose their minds and become reduced to mere husks. These husks are then plagued to wander the world forever; as nothing but shadows of humanity. They are hostile: attacking whoever gets close to them.~This, is where you come in. You are a cursed undead waiting to go hollow in an asylum. However, you are freed from your cell to fulfill an ancient prophecy to 'Re-kindle the Age of Fire' (Again, go look it up). And from there on, your quest begins.(Big nutshell I know, but this game has metric shed-tonnes of lore!) So! With that explained, what's the actual game like?~Well, the game does have a reputation for being very difficult, and whereas I didn't really have too much trouble with the game myself, I understand that it can be quite hard to get used to. The game could be said to be a hack 'n' slasher, but also an action-adventure game with RPG elements. At the start of the game, you pick a class to play, (classes include pyromancers, knights, sorcerers etc) and you then play through the game, levelling up and gaining new items to fit that class. The classes can be blended, so don't think that if you pick knight, you're stuck to using melee for the rest of the game; you could do a knight-sorcerer blend, or a knight-pyromancer etc etc etc. ~The combat (which is basically the core gameplay mechanic of Dark Souls), is very well polished and rounded. It's dangerous enough to maintain a high level of challenge, but balanced enough to be (relatively!) fair; if you die, there's a 90% chance that is was YOU that screwed up, not the game. This balance means that whenever you die, you don't become exasperated, you simply grit your teeth and go at it again. (Not always, but you rarely get to the instance where you might ragequit from the game) In addition, the game carefully avoids being artificially difficult (enemies with ridiculous health bars or stupid amounts of DPS etc), and is instead naturally difficult; with the difficult relying on how well you play the game, not how high-level you are. (It is entirely possible to complete the game without levelling up at all!) ~The game also includes a unique game-mechanic called the 'Humanity system'. I shan't go into the lore, but basically, humanity can be picked up from monster drops as an item, and absorbed from fallen enemies as 'liquid humanity' (Humanity picked up as items can be used to increase the amount of liquid humanity you possess). This 'liquid humanity' is used to kindle bonfires (basically more health kits at checkpoints), and also to reverse the hollowing process. When you die in Dark Souls, you lose your liquid humanity, and also your 'Souls' (ingame currency for BOTH purchases and levelling). You can go to recover them from the last safe place you stood before you died, but if you die on the way there, they are gone forever. ~This is due to the constantly moving world of Dark Souls, and that you can't simply revert a save in Dark Souls; a choice made is a choice made, it cannot be reversed or altered for the rest of the playthrough. (Again, another way the game is naturally challenging.) ~You can also transition from two separate player states within the game; Human and Hollow. When hollow, you cannot interact with other players of the game, and you cannot summon NPCs to help you with certain boss fights. When Human, you can summon both NPCs and other players into your world for co-op play, but you also run the risk of being invaded by hostile players who seek a duel to the death. Therefore, it is recommended that you traverse most of the world as a hollow, only converting back to human when you need help with a boss or an area.All of these factors combine to make the challenging, yet highly entertaining, odyssey that is Dark Souls.ALL IN ALL, DARK SOULS IS A FANTASTIC GAME.I sincerely enjoyed the time I spent playing this game, and I intend to play it for many, many more hours to come. It's tough, engaging, and ultimately, barrels filled with puppies and kittens of fun. This game is definitely worth you buying it! "

												First things first: if you buy this game, get the fan-made DSFix patch to sort out the visual issues in what is a truly awful console port.Okay so: I still can't figure out whether or not I think this is actually a good game, but it's certainly the most fascinating one of the last console generation. The good things about it are stupendously amazing (combat, sense of place and immersion, Metroidesque world design) but the weird stuff about it is kind of crazily ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (opaque RPG mechanics, boss resistances/weaknesses that cannot be logically deduced). The barrier to entry is absurd and I would argue most gamers - not most people, most *gamers* - would need to take a look at the game wiki before even attempting the first level if they want to get any enjoyment out of it at all. I would also argue that half the reason for the fanatical cult following is that it's the exact opposite of all the boring lead-you-by-the-nose design-by-committee perpetual-quest-marker ♥♥♥♥♥♥-cutscene-riddled tutorial-fests that dominate AAA gaming at the moment. Like modern games are so scared you might get a widdle bit stuck somewhewe, so petrified of the rollercoaster stalling for a minute, that they've sacrificed the satisfaction you feel when you discover stuff for yourself and overcome real obstacles in exchange for an experience which is kind of okay fun the whole time but completely unmemorable afterwards. But boy oh boy is this game a crazy backlash against all these tendencies.I recommend it because I think it's utterly fascinating and totally fantastic that it exists, and that anyone who likes games should give it a go at least once because if you're the right kind of person for it you'll probably love it so much that it will ruin other games for you. But by the same token, The Legend of Zelda games conjure a lot of the same good feelings, without the trade-off of all that dread and fear and frustration. So this is a recommendation with a caveat I guess. I dunno. This is probably not a great product recommendation. I'm really bad at selling stuff to people. The only thing I could sell when I worked at a phone store was an iPhone most of the time, and that was because people would literally just come in and say ""Hello, I want an iPhone"".EDIT: After an investment of a good 25 hours, here is my revised review: this game is amazing. Buy it. Buy it now.			"

												This is one of the best games of this generation. What makes it so? A formula very close to the one present in games called ""Metroidvanias"". In short, the idea is that we have a game world almost freely explorable. Almost, because some elements require certain things of the player, be it an item, skill or practical knowledge. The design tries to not implore the one right way, leaving an aspect of creativity for the players. This, in case of a Metroidvania game, Super Metroid, allowed to form a strong community focused on sequence breaking and optimizing playthroughs in the means of tool assisted speedruns. Dark Souls seem to acknowledge such efforts and provide players with tools to unite in cracking the game open. Bloodstains, messages, summoning and on the other hand, PvP, makes you feel being a part of an interesting and mysterious endeavour.While Dark Souls does not have as flexible game world as Super Metroid, it adds its own fresh element in form of eeriness. There is no holding hand so present in 99% of modern video games. Hints are obscure and subcutaneous, in form of item descriptions and vague stories told by NPCs. In fact, most of the plot-meat hides there. One would think this equals to weak lore or story, yet quite the opposite happens. Remember 8-bit games and how you wondered what this sprite really portaits, or imagined details beyond what was shown to you? Remember the feeling of reading your first books? This is what Dark Souls brings: the canvas for you to draw on with your imagination while the game provides brushes and inks.Dark Souls has one important gameplay aspect: you can be killed as easily by the boss as the weakest enemy. This effectively works as a kind of intimidation - you want to be cautios and situations can get tense. At the same time, your mistakes are almost always costly and the landscape also works against you. All of these create a tremendous immersion effect and often make you reconsider your approach, all the while instilling humility into you.What really makes the game fun at the core is the fighting system. The animations are detailed, attacks have the feel and power to them, different weapons have vastly different animation styles. Parry and backstab mechanics are plenty rewarding and never get old.RPG fans can find huge amounts of customization and variety of playthroughs, but what's important is that the game is fairly balanced in terms of equipment. A weaker gear can be just as much viable, because movement and attack style are equally important with damage dealt.Lastly, you have huge amounts of satisfaction coming from won boss fights and clearing areas, but that's only the resultant of coherent design which allows you to learn, improve and fight with your weaknesses.If you want to play a modern video game which does not insult your intelligence and does not constantly put a carrot on a stick in front of you, by any means, check it.

 Positive + A high learning curve for the gameplay, illustrating how important game knowledge and skill are in order to persevere through the numerous difficult parts of the game, truly encapsulating the rewarding feeling of beating a certain dungeon or boss; the game is rarely (if ever) unfairly difficult+ Beautifully rendered environments and intricately detailed enemies makes exploring the world of Dark Souls simply breathtaking+ A ridiculous amount of content to get stuck in to: with many huge areas to explore, bosses to defeat, and items to collect (personally, the game took me almost 55 hours to unlock all of the achievements, one complete runthrough of the game will take roughly 20-25 hours). The included Artorias of the Abyss DLC will add another 2-3 hours on top of that. Negative - While the gameplay is the main focus of the game, the story could do with some more fleshing out; the characters met along the way and their backstories only add so much to the experience. Worth Mentioning • When the game was ported to PC initially, certain technical limitations constricted the game, essentially making the game not run optimally (courtesy of From Software not having experience on PC architecture). Luckily, a member of the community created “DSfix”, which essentially optimises the game for PC and greatly improves performance, nullifying many of the problems that plagued the game on release (low resolution, no anti-aliasing, frame rate cap etc.). Verdict “Possibly my most engaging and memorable gaming experience to date. Dark Souls is simply one of, if not the best, action RPG I’ve ever played. With difficult gameplay that only sets out to weed out the weak gamers from the best, you would be a fool to want to not challenge yourself and beat this game once in your life.” 9.5/10 TJBs  "

												Took me about 10 hours worth of frustration to finally get into the game and start enjoying it. Mostly because so little is explained in-game. I'd recommend watching a few beginners videos on youtube if you feel stuck. Once I got into the swing of it, I fell in love with this game.It's the type of game that is so rage inducing, yet so satisfying. You actually fear for your life in certain areas because you are between bonfires, or deep in some unknown area exploring and trying not to die. The boss battles are great, particularly the design of the bosses themselves. I have found myself just appreciating them for a moment...and then they beat me to death in 2-3 hits...lolThe PvP and summoning are also great elements. I really hope that they switch it to Steamworks soon though, so that the game doesn't lose that aspect of the gameplay, or just die.... The combat in general is awesome. This is my first run through and I have just went for a strength/endurance build for the most part.It's one of the only games that I have played where I am actually happy to go and check out things on a wiki page, while also trying to avoid any spoilers.Anyway, it's a fantastic game and very satisfying...and it has also made me facepalm hard, swear at the TV, and temporarily quit the game to calm down, but when you beat the boss or area you are stuck on, and get to grips with the subtly of the combat, it is hard to top.

												The ultimate action RPG. This is for people who can enjoy trial and error and have the patience to learn from their mistakes. The game isn't ""hard"" like the hype says, but rather gives the player a fair challenge and punishes them for making mistakes. There is also an exploration element since the world is semi open world, by which I mean the map is a cobweb of pathways. The plot is very vague as well which adds to the mystery of the world. The gameplay is heavily based on learning attack animations of enemies and the weapons you use. There's also thematic online multiplayer. This is where you can have jolly co-operation or invasion where either you or someone else are going to be killed.Also here are my tips to newbies:* Use DSfix* Use a PS3 or Xbox360 controller to play* Only look up a guide if you get stuck, because looking at a guide from the start hinders your ability to learn the game* If you're going the melee route, keep in mind that the stat Endurance is very helpful* With armor, mobility is important but Poise is helpful as well* Go human once and awhile, you're missing out on the unique multiplayer experience if you don't!And for when you inevitably get stuck, remember this: Explore everything; if something doesn't work try something new! Experiment!			"

												Dark Souls. The name alone sent shivers up my spine when a friend recommended it a month ago, notorious for it's sheer brutatlity and such little attempts to hold your hand or guide you along the way,I went in expecting to get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me...i was correct xD Luckily i emerged victourious and haven't felt so majestic about a game in my life BAHAHA! I don't know what kept me going, but just that feeling of evolving from a scrawny, half naked, low level wanderer, desperately attempting to defend off simple hollows while wielding a striaght sword hilt...to an almighty force to be reckoned with wielding a Black Knight Greatsword battling Taurus Demons in the lava plauged wastes of Lost Izalith...was immense! This game also brings along a sense of strong entitlement upon completion, having beaten one of the most difficult games out in todays world, you can deffinitely call yourself a true gamer <3Please have a go at this game and don't give up, The start is a challenge then the rest of the journey is amazing fun and rewarding, with a few major highlights that left me sitting in pool of tears and banging my head agains the wall! E.g Blight Town those pesky little s**ts with the toxic darts! at first i was like wtf hit me and how did i get toxic...OMG IM LOSING SO MUCH HEALTH SO FAST!!!!!....then i saw the tiny specks they call ""toxic darts""...Anor Londo, Silver Knight Archers and those f**king walk ways..haha, ORNSTEIN AND SMOUGH! oh my god never have i enjoyed such a hardship of a fight the best (and most straining) boss battle in the game in my opinion! (Basically just anor londo in general LOL!) Dukes archives sucked a bit with those damn channelers and archers :P Crystal Cave with those invisble walk ways and damn clams!!! Still think they are the hardest regular enemies xD Then the final fight of Gwyn Lord of Cinder! I went in not knowing wtf parrying even was LOL once i trained for hours how to parry and could make my way all the way to his fog door past 5 Black Knights without taking any damage and parrying the whole way, i could finnaly stand a chance!This game is like the Mona Lisa of art, everyone should play it. Bring on NG+- 10/10 GG Praise the Sun!			"

												Truely an incredible game. I had in steam library over a year and a half before I got into it. I was never able to beat the intial boss so it always turned me off. After watching some gameplay on twitch I forced to give another legit shot. And holllly♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ Skyrim, this is 10x as better more challenging. The dark obscure storyline,. that your meant to peice together on own is a refreshing change. The combat... Well its Dark Souls. lol. Highly reccomend!! 10/10			"

This ember burns down low... you hear the song ringing in your head. You grip your broken sword as you plunge it into the head of the Asylum Demon barring your way to the Firelink Shrine, the tutorial of this game a vicious boss fight.I would give it all... you realize you aresinging to yourself to maintain yoursanity.DARK SOULS PREPARE TO DIE EDITIONThe giant raven airdrops you into theruins of the game's first area, and thesense of senselessness, dread and pureatmosphere of the game beckons youwith the sight of the Bonfire, the way inwhich you respawn after death andenemies reset, your currency of soulsredrawing to zero.It was not always like this. And a game,a world the likes of DARK SOULS is notone for the faint of heart, the man withsomething to live for, the casul. Onceyou had a promising future, bright andlit after Ms. Novocaine left you and theGoddess of the Sun, Summer-Rain cameinto your life. But it has been six months since that May,since she was gone. The sickness hadravaged her, and videogames were heronly refuge from the pain eating away ather body. She sought refuge in the loveof the controller, the keyboard and mouse,and in you.You were in denial at her loss for six months,and at long last, in November, the month offate, is when you were shaken out of yourstupor and idleness. You having withdrawnfrom the world and your friends moved onor given up, graduated. In the end, it wasnot your friends who saved you then, butyour enemies.""Coldheart."" The terse voice states, like acommand from the Keepers, serpents ofDARK SOULS who have guided and chidedmankind.Killer's Conscience, leader of the Trinity ofHollywood, your enemies, leans against thedoor, looking at you while you explore thegame's worst and infamous area, the talland poisonous ramshackle swamp ofBlighttown. ""Starboy. It has been months.""""Yeah."" You manage, entering a mountainmade of pure cobwebs, which itself morphsinto a church bordering on magma. Thedesign of DARK SOULS is varied, entwinedto a meticulous degree and populated bycreatures sparsely, giving you a viciouschallenge with their relentless A.I.""I'm sorry."" Killer's Conscience manages,as you fight the strangely attractivehalf-spider witch Queelag. You ring thesecond bell to gain access to the game'sprimary draw, the area of Anor Londo,a beautiful gothic expanse which is emptysave for the enemies which bay for yourblood.Killer's Conscience is livid, but impressedat your progress, marvelling at how farand how efficient you have become atkilling, at blazing through the horde ofmonstrosities keeping you from yourobjective, reigniting the heart of anepoch, the First Flame, to prevent theage of Darkness from consuming all.""You're pretty good."" Killer's Consciencesays after awhile, seemingly meditatingon your progress as a silent, almostnonexistent observer. ""Thanks."" yourreply comes without thought, as younow enter the antechamber with thetwo posterboys of pain, DragonslayerOrnstein and Executioner Smough!You grunt a response, as you finish offOrnstein. Smough absorbs his power,but then Killer's Conscience steps nextto you as you finish off Smough, andyou collect his loot and souls. You lookat him expectant, guessing he will tryto fight you as some next boss fromDARK SOULS itself like you both usedto, when Summer-Rain was alive.""You haven't touched the DLC? Theone with the lost land of Oolacile andKnight Artorias?"" You shake your headwithout a word, walking towards thedouble doors of Queen Gwynevere,whose chest is the stuff of legend.""Haven't even fought Black DragonKalameet... I need to retrieve-""You are about to finish the sentencewhen Killer's Conscience presentswhat you seek in the game.

Killer's Conscience replies.You look back at him, your owncharacter static in DARK SOULSitself. Your eyes flash, and Killer'sConscience knows the look youhave... after all, he had it once as well.""Is it true? Can it..."" You begin, your voice cracking, images ofSummer-Rain inexplicably glazeover you and overlay with yourvision of Killer's Conscience andthe present. ""Yes."" He begins inresponse to you, gesturing as theempty Lordvessel, a teleportingartifact of power beckons beforeyour eyes. ""It cannot bring ourSummer-Rain back... but not yet.""You blink once more in utter disbelief.""What...?!""

												The game itself is not bad..but the PC port...omg.The game's difficulty is a lot increased by the mouse/keyboard controls.I could not play it longer to really enjoy it...Not recommended for mouse/keyboard controls.It screams so much console, that even the action buttons are still console like ( the X is not the X, is some button from the console). Really confusing and annoying.Edit:I have added a short gameplay video...P.S. The mouse arrow is visible in the game...

												F#cking Dark Souls, God damn it. When the game came out years ago, I was tasked to make a review of it, and I bashed the game so God damn hard. However, over the time, some of it's issues got fixed, while others seem more or less forgetable. Is the game good? Well... It's more or less a ""flawed master-piece"". As usual though, I'll start with the bad stuff of the game.The biggest issue on the game, something that has stayed over the years, is the fact that the PC port is a piece of crap. Now follow me on this, it wasn't a piece of crap before, but rather an ENTIRE crap. After a few years of the Games  For Windows Live release, the devs FINALLY NOTICED how bad it was, and since GFWL sort of died, they ported it fully into Steam, and fixed SOME of it's issues. However, the game still performs badly in some PC's, while playing with a keyboard is a sadistic experience. You NEED a controller. And it also doesn't help that all text and tips ingame show Xbox360 controller buttons. EDIT: I also forgot to mention Blight-Town, an area of the game. F#ck my #sshole sideways, that place still has insane frame-rate drops and plays like crap today. Avoid it at all costs. You can infact avoid most of it by getting the Master Key at the start AND I SERIOUSLY SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME. IT EVEN HAS SOME FPS DROPS ON CONSOLE FOR F#CK SAKE!The second issue on it, is the multiplayer. Now, if you have played this game, I will ask you to read this to the end before bashing this review. It's fun and inmersive, but it's also broken as hell. To begin with, there's quite the amount of hackers roaming arround the game, some of them are nice and only modified their character in a cosmetic point. Others though, have unlimited HP, unlimited stamina, and even broken items that are not supposed to be used, like the infamous Instant-Curse sword. Of course it's fun when you manage to kill them, like I did already a ton of times (will put one of my videos about it under this text), but most of the time you'll die because of the hacks.

			Here we can observe and study the wild-life of Lordran. Here's a link for his Steam account, report him for hacking: http://steamcommunity.com/id/dabl_kill/ There's some lag with the audio, but I'm...		

The other part of the broken multiplayer is something that I've also decided to exploit, and study how broken it was. There is some sort of level system when you invade, meaning that if you're level 100 it's not possible to invade someone of level 10 in normal ways. However, you can play the entire game at low levels, get insane gear and then come back to low level areas to EXTERMINATE other players in literally one hit, even through their shields because of their low stats. I literally started as Pyromancer, leveled up to lvl13, went through the game like that, farmed Giantdad set (except double Black-Flame, haven't yet gone NG+), and went through the Undead Parish killing people (and a ton of hackers) for days. And I was not the only guy doing it. For what I know, it's sort of fixed in Dark Souls 2, but the devs did nothing to avoid that in DK1, so you should AVOID multiplayer at low levels, or get ready to get completely annihilated. EDIT: I also did a video on that as well, forgot to put it here:

			Ever wanted to be a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? To be the cheapest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in an unbalanced game? Then this is the perfect guide for you. Start as Pyromancer.		

Another issue I have is more or less with the community. Guys, let's sit down for a minute here and talk about this: Dark Souls IS NOT DIFFICULT. It's not. It's a fair game with fair difficulty. The issue is that most OTHER GAMES are TOO EASY, hold your hand too much. If you trully want difficult games, there's way better ones than this one. Dark Souls is a game where you are supposed to think before you act, not another of those casul games where you just run straight ahead, eat lead and then hide for 8 seconds until the blood of your screen cleans up. If you die, it's 90% of the times YOUR fault, the other 10% being unpatched bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC controls, broken multiplayer or bad network.The last issue is something that a lot of people will sadly experience, and it's the fact that while it's cool that the game does not hold your hand at all, once outside the tutorial area you will NOT know where the f#ck you're supposed to go. The game doesn't trully give you any direction (except for the Firelink crestfallen NPC, but his hints ain't really that helpful and he will move from there midway the game anyway). That means you'll have to explore, and most likely you will go the wrong way, and face enemies WAY tougher than the enemies you're supposed to be facing at the moment, which will utterly f#ck the living sh#t out of you. A map could've been cool, and it wouldn't kill the inmersion of the PLAYER ITSELF (or the character) was the one drawing it.That being said, the game is quite fun, once you go over those problems. It's really inmersive, and it's one of those kind of games were you can find a ton of different ways to get over a problem. The amount of variety in weapons, armor, spells and items is quite great, and seriously beats other games such as Skyrim, where most items are the same  but with slightly higher stats and different graphics. Here, most weapons feel unique, although some of them like the Pickaxe really suck in all kinds of ways. You can also upgrade weapons into different kinds of stats and even upgrade them into new, special weapons, most of them from fallen bosses.The gameplay, ignoring bugs and such is solid. You trully feel like it's a dangerous place, and trully feel in control. You can build your own character, your own playstyle, and even go through the bosses in whatever dumb order you feel like.The lore is there. It's explained through item descriptions (something I find dumb, but it kind of works out) and NPC's, which are GREAT.The multiplayer, ignoring the fact that it was some huge flaws, is also quite fun. Is the game being too difficult on your casul butt? You can summon random players from other parts of the world into your game, to aid you through the area and beat the boss. However to do so, you need to be human, and being human also allows other random players to INVADE your game, and hunt you down. There are different covenants based upon the multiplayer aspect, although if you're playing alone and leaving the multiplayer aside, you won't give a crap about them.The character creation system is also hilariously broken, allowing the player to, if you so desire, create some seriously disgusting abominations as your character.In the end, it's a good game, and I do recommend it. However, you should only play it if you enjoy a fair challenge, like RPG-Action games, AND HAVE A WORKING CONTROLLER. Without a controller, the game is literally unplayable. I ended up picking it up for 5€ on a sale, and for that price it's a solid purchase.Just remember though, THE LEGEND WILL NEVER DIE.I also made a video time ago about my first serious playthrough (the first one was in PC at release and I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, a year later I played it on Xbox360, where I had fun), showing that the game ain't really that difficult and it's actually a ton of fun, highlighting the best moments. It's filled with spoilers though, be aware of that.

												Originally, many years ago in a distant land. I had purchased this game for PS3, as its cover (and back of it) had reminded me of 'Monster Hunter FU' for a whopping 70 AUD. Turns out it barely resembled 'Monster Hunter', unless you can call it a dark and medieval variant of it. Aaaanyway, I got the game and got p*ssed off by the first boss (patience wasn't my strong point) and didn't play it for months. Then I came back to it after awhile and passed the first boss quite easily as I had decided to roll between its feet instead of in its attacking range. From then on I was hooked by it. Did a couple play throughs and cursed my way happily through the game.Then one day I decided I'd buy it for my computer too, I couldn't be bothered loading up the PS3 anymore, so here we are. Since DS1: Prepare To Die Edition on the PS3 I moved onto Dark Souls 2 which was fun, but it was great to play the this one again after a fair while.This game is fun and addictive, however you can get easily frustrated and p*ssed off by it too. Dark Souls can be a bit vague at times and you'll feel like you have done the same thing for the past eternity if you get stuck...but this game is very much worth buying and playing!			"

												One of the best games of all time, hands down. Like a mature Legend of Zelda/Castlevania mashup. One of the most immersive games in existence, and one of the most straightforward, fair yet challenging ones too. The areas don't feel like levels in the second and third games, either, which is nice. ♥♥♥♥ it if it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥port with♥♥♥♥♥♥KB/M controls- get a controller and plug that♥♥♥♥♥♥in! And a little extra side note: Demon's Souls and Bloodborne are also excellent, arguably just as good/arguably better than Dark Souls, give them a try! Demon's Souls is a much different flavor, weak at some points and stronger in others; a prototype. Bloodborne is a fast-paced Lovecraftian that is more immersive than Dark Souls, and looks nicer, too... if only it were longer!			"

												ORIGINAL REVIEW: Well, this game might be god. It could be the greatest game of all time. But you see that ""Strongly recommended to have a gamepad"" message? Yeah, I bought a controller specifically for this game, and it doesn't work. The controller works with every single other game, but this POS PC port is god awful. I've tried every bug fix, re-installed, and contacted support. Still doesn't work. I'm not going to play it without a controller, and the game's unplayable without it. Yeah, I could mod it to make it more bearable, but if you port a game to PC without making the game at least half decent, you don't deserve the money. If I could refund the game, I would.CURRENT REVIEW: The games alright, finally found a mod to make the game think that my XBOX 360 CONTROLLER is an XBOX 360 CONTROLLER. Called x360ce, works well.

												THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is the funniest movie that I have seen in years. I initially had passed on watching it in the theater because I thought it looked childish, but was convinced to give it a try now that it was out on video. Boy, was my initial impression wrong.The story revolves around a selfish prince who is turned into a llama by one of his subjects. With the help of a kindly peasant he attempts to regain his throne, and in the process finds there's more to him than he previously thought or wanted there to be. While the moral is a good one, it really plays a secondary role to the comedy, which is literally non-stop. GROOVE takes the rapid-fire humor that Disney perfected in Aladdin and combines it with cartoon-style hijinx, the wit of David Spade, and a hilarious lack of reverence for the traditional Disney animated genre. Spade plays his role to perfection, and luckily never crosses the line into being obnoxious. Seinfeld fans are in for a treat, as Puddy plays a very special side-kick role. You really can't take your eyes off the screen for a minute, because you're guaranteed to miss a gag of some sort. The humor works mainly on an adult level, even though kids will be rolling from the funny visuals and some of the more obvious jokes.The DVD itself is a good one. The digital transfer was excellent and the sound quality is top notch. The commentary track is one of the better that I've heard, with interesting and funny insight from all contributors. Animated menus. There's a deleted scene that was probably best left out, but is interesting to watch anyway, plus a few other fun features.In the end, this is one of the best Disney flicks to come along in years. Hardcore Disney fans will eat it up. But even if you're not a fan of Disney's usual animated features you should give GROOVE a shot. Cast aside your pre-concieved notions and you just might be in for a very pleasant surprise. I was. FIVE STARS.			"

												Seriously, this is one of the best games I ever played. Maybe /the/ best, so far. Why? I have no idea, I started playing, but I gave up, rather quickly, it was just too damn hard.  But then, I tried again and I made progress, where I failed the last time. What a satisfying feeling. And there the fever got me, I wanted to keep playing, to level up, to get the best equipment, or to just see how the next level looks like.But on my way to the End, I cried, I danced in joy, or I was just happy I survive, with my heart racing like I've been running for miles. No game, I ever played, got me so tied up and made me want to play again, no matter how often I died.Some people say, this game has no story, well. On the first glance, there is none. But one of the strengths of Dark Souls, is also it's Story Line, it's hidden. You need to find piece of a puzzle, that you never will truly complete, it gives you hints and you have to make your own story from it. You are in a hostile world, you against everybody else, this just get's underlined by it. Seriously, who can take to die some times and is willing to play a game, where you aren't the Literal God of War, slaying everybody after a while without any problems. You should give Dark Souls a try. This game is really a jewel in the RPG scene and a title, you shouldn't miss.			"

												If you are prepare to die this game is for you. You will die alot but each death will teach you something, If you like the challanging gameplay this game is one of the best. This game is hard when you first play it because lack of instructions for beginers but as you go on game will become easy.Pros:- Lots of unique enemies. Each area has its own type of enemies. I should say these normal enemies will kill you more than area boss. Great Level Design. All the areas in the game are interconnected.  Some of the best boss fights I ever seen. It feels very satifying to kill some bosses.  Great sound design. Ambient music when you fight with boss feels great. Sound when boss hit their weapon and you block it with your shield feels real. Lots of weapons to choose from. Every weapon has its own unique move set. You can build your character anyway you like. Great DLC content. Coop and PVP battles.Cons:- Pyromancy feels over powered. Most of the bosses in dark souls are weak to fire, Even some of them are good against fire they still die easily with fully upgraded pyromancies. Very bad PC port. One of the worst port I ever seen. Frame rate some times drops at certain areas not much but you can feel it. Although game's art style is great graphics doesn't feel that great.This game is not perfect. It has its flows. I give this game 8/10.			"

												This is obviously a very late review of Dark Souls so why review it now? Well to start things off simple, the big sales are coming around so if you feel the urge to buy it from Steam but not sure about it? Well here's a review you may or may not find helpful. The other reason is...Dark Souls II is just less than four months away and what better way to prepare than to review its predecessor for newcommers! Combat:The combat in Dark Souls is very basic, you have your left hand equipment for blocking and right hand equipment for attacking of two types, standard and strong attacks. Keeping this in mind that it can and might apply to all classes you may use, there are different classes you can make so you might be a sorcerer, cleric, strenght, dexterity, or mix. Also keeping this in mind, each weapon has a certain stat that scales and is required to use. This adds to the combat of what you can and can't use. Now onto the actual combat sequences: the actual combat is well designed and very fluid. Any time you die it is always your mistake of how you approached an enemy. It's no hack and slash game that's for sure, that is how you get yourself killed. Combat in this game is all about timing and approachment and it's glorious.Story:Now I will not get much into this, not that there is much surface story for you to absorb from just plowing through but, the story starts you off in a place called the Undead Asylum. After you escape you learn of these two bells and from there on out your journy continues There is a bit more of the surface story that can be hand fed to you but like I said, not going to spoil much. The lore or backstory of this is what links everything that may seem confusing together. Through From Software's brilliant design they have made it like a broken puzzle to find it all out. You learn everything through item descriptions, dialgogue, and even some times just by the looks of the area if your observant enough. It's hard work but the results will not dissapoint. Bosses & Common Enemies: To start this seciton off, we're going to start with common enemies, yeah those guys. The enemies in Dark Souls are of interesting nature, unlike in games like the First Person Shooters where they stand around like lost children, these enemies are aggressive and persistent. They are stupid enough to beat but smart enough to punish. Now when I say stupid I do not mean fit the shapes stupid, I mean they are trimmed down just enough to where they are not some diety sent form the gods to punish you, they are very much beatable. Some enemies may be smarter or tougher than others but all are beatable. The trick is they all know how to punish you for screwing up. Mistakes in Dark Souls are not forgiven. This paragraph will all be for the details of the most epic fights you will face, even if the boss seems...eh. Okay, skipping the obvious known fact of Dark Souls being known for its intense boss fights, lets discuss WHY they're intense.  Music only plays on very few occasions outside of boss fights but when these boss fights do ensue, music starts that captivates the feel of your character's challange ahead of them, the terror that they are fighting. With that included you can even tell by the way the boss fights. If it's sad or depressing music, it is a story of tragedy or sorrow. Vice versa if it's loud and fast, you get the feeling the boss is  full of rage or beast-like properties that knows no mercy. These boss fights are something that are more than just a challange, they have a story behind them and are masterpieces, each and every one of them...except Bed of Chaos.Graphics & performance:Now this is a subject I usually leave alone but in Dark Souls's case, it must be adressed. Not because it truely matters if you played it on PS3 or Xbox 360 but because of how atrocious of a port this game was. Locked in at 30 frames per second with a very poor graphic quality locked in that wasn't even 720p made it look terrible on the stretched screen of the PC. It was an exact copy paste of the Xbox 360 version, no modifications to optimize this baby. Now before you start getting freaked out and shy away, there is a mod to fix this. It is called the DSFix mod and it unlocks the frame rate and graphics settings. If you don't got the mod the game will look muddy and not play smooth, with it installed you got a pretty, dark atmospheric game and have a smooth frame rate that doesn't murder your frames in the cruel area of Blighttown.Final Verdict: I know this review seems a bit short and very rushed and it is, 2:36 in the morning is not the ideal time to do these things. I am going to give it 2 scores, one w/o the mod and one with it. This is being done so you can get an idea of what  experience you will get. WIthout the mod:  6/10. This game is nearly unplayable without the mod. The keyboard bindings are not so hot, the frame rate is locked in at 30 which for a PC game is not the ideal setting to be playing at, and very muddy, stretched graphics from the locked in graphics setting of something less than 720p stretched out onto a monitor. With the mod: 9/10If you got the mod installed you will not regret it at all and you are in for a masterpiece only obtainable by the skills of From Software and the publishing efforts of Namco Bandai. After notes:-It is highly recommended to use a gamepad for this game. Keyboard bindings like I said are not that good and this is a straight up console port. -Installation of the mod is easy, follow the files in the order below in whichever program x you haveSteamSteamAppsCommonDark Souls Prepare to Die EditionDATANow drop the files you have extracted from the DSFix compressed into here and follow any remaining instructions.Find DSFix and edit the game settings there.

												This game truly is a masterpiece!That said, let´s begin with a more ""reasonable"" review.Dark Souls  is a hard game, not always because of the cruel, hard enemies that will let you scream ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!""more than once, but because of the lack of direcrion.But because of that dieing isn´t a shame but a mean of progress. It shows you your enemies move sets and potential traps so that you can do better with your next life.That might seem like a bad thing in an RPG, but for this RPG it really sets the dark feeling of isolation and beeing ""lost"" in the very hostile world of Lordran. The world is nearly completely free to explore right from the begining, yet you won´t progress much if in the wrong areas. There even are areas that aren´t needed for the story at all, which is a thing most games don´t do anymore.All this may result in a playtime of 60-100Hours on the first playthrough if played blind. (I admit, i didn´t play completely blind :( )Also lore is handled very differently than in everything i´ve seen so far, there´s an intro video telling you a tiny bit and the rest is up to you to find and combine through conversations and item descriptions. That may mean that you really have to ""work"" to feel immersed, but it weirdly doesn´t make the lore any worse but  better since your imagination takes a Huge role.Gameplay wise Dark Souls  is one of the best games I´ve played so far, it doesn´t have any complex or fancy combos, but it has a wide variety of weapons, shield, spells, pyromancies and miracles to fit everyones playstyle in some way.Added to that is the harsh management of your stamina that is more than limited, a great counter and parry mechanic, sneaky backstabs and a working, yet a bit unfair and broken PvP and Co-op mechanic. The multiplayer sadly is a bit hard to manage because of the GFWL.Did i mention GFWL? That brings us to the bad sides of this version of Dark Souls.It is a bad port, like REALLY bad. You need to install a mod called DSfix to make it work, and even then GFWL could cause some trouble, which really is a shame.These are severy problems that can be fixed easily though. There are a ton of Videos on Youtube that show you how to install DSfix and the steam forums are always nice if you ask there too, so don´t be scared even if you´ve never inbstalled a mod before.When the mod is installed the game runs well and even looks far better than console versions, and that really is worth the modding.All in all this concludes to me telling you that this is probably the best ActionRPG you could (and should) buy.And as always:Prepare To Die!

												While I dislike consoles and most games that are tailor made for them, this has been a pleasant surprise.Even though the control scheme is a nightmare without a controller, it can be mastered.The game itself is very interesting, the graphics are nice (even today they are impressive) and the settings are truly grand. At its core it is an action rpg, where you get to fight overwhelmingly powerful enemies at all turns. Even at higher levels you can end up dying to monsters that seem trivial, when careless. The bosses are all powerful, some to the point where they seem impossible to beat. Don't despair, there is always a way... unless you attack something totally out of your depth (haven't had the experience yet). Having said the above, don't be mistaken you have to die over and over and over to figure out the tactics and hone the skills that will be needed to dispatch of certain enemies.The plot line is ok, nothing tremendous, but it is supported by a setting of such grandness, that ends up lifting it to great heights.For me the true strength of the game is the freedom it gives you to explore your own play-style and build your character the way you want. I have heard that this can lead to some unplayable character builds, however I don t see that happening past 1 or 2 characters (I abandoned my first character too - however after going further with my next character I realized it was more a matter of inexperience and lack of knowledge, rather than character abilities).One thing that is both a strength and a weakness is the lack of information... it is so easy to miss things (important things mind you) that it can become frustrating. If one thing is for certain, it is that the player needs to be very alert and explore all corners of each area. The main problem with searching everything, is that there is very little to find (extra/semi hidden stuff), but still it is there to find and you should look for it.In terms of openness, it does have a slight linearity at first, but soon you get the choice to explore at your own leisure. Now a warning... (this falls under the no information problem) you may be exploring an area where you have no way of continuing further (with very little indication that there is anything further) without first completing something in another area and while at the end of the day it may seem logical and aligned with the plot, it is extremely easy to miss it (one thing to keep in mind is always pay attention to the npc dialogs and talk to them often).While dying is a integral part of the game, which you get used to after a short while, it can still be frustrating... mostly when you die because you fall of an edge, or get pushed off one or you press the wrong button... at the end of the day anything in the world can kill you, not just the actual enemies.I play this on my (older) laptop, which kind of sucks (the laptop), but it still can cope, thus anyone with a decent rig can play it.The multiplayer aspect of the game is a bit peculiar, where (under specific conditions) other players can invade your world and attack you (you have no choice in the matter), something that can be frustrating. On the other hand you can call other players for a bit of coop or be summoned (if you are willing) to help others.Overall its a great game (not just good) even with all the minor problems and frustrations - it just consumes you... so be careful.

If one thing is for certain, it is that the player needs to be very alert and explore all corners of each area. The main problem with searching everything, is that there is very little to find (extra/semi hidden stuff), but still it is there to find and you should look for it.In terms of openness, it does have a slight linearity at first, but soon you get the choice to explore at your own leisure. Now a warning... (this falls under the no information problem) you may be exploring an area where you have no way of continuing further (with very little indication that there is anything further) without first completing something in another area and while at the end of the day it may seem logical and aligned with the plot, it is extremely easy to miss it (one thing to keep in mind is always pay attention to the npc dialogs and talk to them often).While dying is a integral part of the game, which you get used to after a short while, it can still be frustrating... mostly when you die because you fall of an edge, or get pushed off one or you press the wrong button... at the end of the day anything in the world can kill you, not just the actual enemies.I play this on my (older) laptop, which kind of sucks (the laptop), but it still can cope, thus anyone with a decent rig can play it.The multiplayer aspect of the game is a bit peculiar, where (under specific conditions) other players can invade your world and attack you (you have no choice in the matter), something that can be frustrating. On the other hand you can call other players for a bit of coop or be summoned (if you are willing) to help others.Overall its a great game (not just good) even with all the minor problems and frustrations - it just consumes you... so be careful.

												Though it seems a poor framework game at the start, with a little tweaking, you are thrown into one of the most challenging and satisfying games you will ever play. Not for the faint hearted or those who give up easily, but those who like to smack giant demons around with weapons larger than your character and triumph over seemingly impossible odds. No other game cries out manmode like this one. This game cries out versatility in almost every aspect be it customizing your character, fighting style, appearance and even how you wish to play the game and progress. There are nearly no boundaries to stop you, only your skill and knowledge. Not to mention a fun pvp system that could be highly improved. 9.5/10 for offline play, a little less speculation of the story would be nice and a bit more concrete lore. 8/10 for pvp play. The online needs much more regulation to stop all the cheating. Otherwise, I would probably give it a 10. I haven't had this much fun duelling other players in a long time.			"

												This game, if you're thinking about getting this, then I have a few things to say. This game is EXTREEEMLY difficult. I've wanted to smash my controller once or twice. You need lots of patience if you want to do well in this game. With the co-op, it's rather different than most games because you can't really play with friends. You're meant to get help from strangers. You also can't go through the entire game with a co-op partner. (At least I think you can't) It's a very good game, but again, it's very difficult. And you're also going to want to use an xbox controller of some sort because the keyboard controlls are horrible.			"

												So i guess what they say is right. This game is not for the masses. It's hard in its own way. You have to master your character's every ability to go on. As an old-school RPG player, i found this difficulty ""weird"". It's not about riddles, puzzles or tactics. It's about consistency. You have to perform good every time you lose and start anew. And you'll lose a lot! So from my point of view, i found it boring instead of challenging to dispatch EVERY time 20 ""weak"" enemies in order to reach and fight again the boss that just kicked my♥♥♥♥♥(boss fights are a whole different story, they are fun). Most stories that you 've heard about broken controllers/keyboards are exactly because of getting ""salty"" and not really of the original difficulty. Also another thing that made a great (negative) impression on me was the TOTAL absense of lore! Never before in a so-called RPG game i have searched on the internet to find clues for even the basic plot! Anyway, i finished it, i enjoyed it but it's not what i expected. Nevertheless i strongly reccomend it.			"

												In 1987, my older brother and I asked for only one thing for Christmas - The Legend of Zelda.  Ok, fine, we also asked for TMNT action figures, but that's a separate review. In any case, I can still remember tearing open the packaging and pulling out the magical golden cartridge.  As all younger brothers, I took the instruction manual as my brother got to play first.  The game starts, of course, with the story of Hyrule and Zelda's abduction.  You then name your character (a first!) and are dropped into Hyrule with nothing but a tiny shield and three measly hearts of life.  Except for finding the wooden sword in the nearby cave, nothing was obvious.  You could travel any cardinal direction, monsters attacking at every turn.  My brother wandered west, a big mistake.  Somehow surviving monsters far above his life/equipment level, he found the third dungeon.  What kind of twisted, depraved game allows a brand new character to enter a high-level area?  The monsters assailed poor Link and his nano-shield. His feable wooden sword only aggravated most monsters and split the chu-chu into more pieces.  Badly wounded, game beaping (still gets my pulse up) we stumbled out of the dungeon, bewildered. After exiting, and breathing a sigh of relief, the nearby tektite promptly killed us. We choose to continue, but our character now had a scarlet letter (number) by his name. With each death, and there were many, the number grew, a grim reminder of how many times we had met a horrible demise.  With persistance (and yes, a bit of help from Nintendo Power), we eventually defeated Ganon.  This was the greatest accomplishment in the first ten years of my life (judge me if you will).  The victory was richly rewarding, and I continue to replay Zelda to this day, trying to win the game in under 90 minutes with all items and no deaths.  My point, beyond reminiscing, is that Dark Souls is the actual sequel to The Legend of Zelda.  Yes, Ocarina et al are technically the sequels, but they have betrayed the essence of the original game.  Zelda has become cutesy, easy, and the amount of hand-holding and tip-giving led me to stop playing the series altogether.  Dark Souls, on the other hand, drops you into a deeply engrossing, unforgivng world with measly weapons and no direction (sound familiar?).  Fine, they tell you to find two bells, but in my original game, I somehow ended up in Drake Valley on my first foray after leaving the asylum.  I walked up to a drake, thinking it was a cut-scene, and he torched me into ash.  I could only think of my brother wandering into the third dungeon.  And like Zelda, the game punished my character with shame for dying, returning me to humanless form.  I'm half-way through (I think), and find myself completely absorbed.  Like Zelda, victory will be sweet and replay will be wonderful.  I hear some people can beat it in a couple of hours. I can't wait to try. "

 DARK SOULS: Prepare To Die Edition  More like ""Prepare to Cry"". But Seriously this is a great production with an amazing atmosphere and history. The game is set in different locations after which you can move around freely, because the game does not hold us by the hand. Locations that we will explore is large and visit such places as the catacombs, dungeons, castles, dark forests without any loading but also painted world or sent back to a past of world of Lordran. The currency is the souls of fallen enemies. Thanks to them, we can improve our character and weapons and buy armor from merchants, however, with every death we lose souls but still you can retrieve it if you get back there and notif you won't die a second time. The game also has a great sound design. Optimization instead is broken so much that in some locations the game is just not playable and the finish it was torture for me. This game has a great climate but it also offer a very high level of difficulty. The fight is an arcade, we have light and strong attacks, blocks and dodges and magic items. Each location has a boss that you will be forced to continuous attempts to change tactics. With this production I had a lot of fun, the game has its flaws but it have something in itself that attracts us. "

												If you're looking for Skyrim move on. This game doesn't let you easily go through it. There is no restarting, you leave off where you exit and death restarts at your last checkpoint. The game saves everything you do and every action you take so you can't cheat around it. When you defeat a boss, you will have a great feel of accomplishment.Your playstyle is very customizable. You can be all sorts of things such as an archer, warrior, mage, or even a jack of all trades all based on how you wish to level up your skill.There is also a multiplayer aspect of it. You can help others by leaving a summon sign and wait for them to summon you to help their world and vice versa. You can also enter their world with a purpose of killing them and taking their souls (currency). The multiplayer is a great addition. If you successfully help someone, you will get Humanity, which increases your item drops, allows you to make stronger flasks(hp pots), etc.Dark Souls isn't an easy game, but if you want one that will reward you for goals that you accomplish, with epic bosses and a emphasis on gameplay (not story), then this will be for you.

В кои то веки сюжет не разжевывается и засовывается игроку в рот. Сюжет рассказывают сами локации, боссы и вещи.Мультиплеер так же уникален и что саме главное - тонко вплетен в сюжет. Пока второсортные разработчики просто пихают несколько сетевых режимов, оторванных от одиночной кампании from software разработали систему где кооперативный и соревновательный мультиплеер органично вливаются друг в друга и создают ощущение монолитного и продуманного геймплея.Конечно игра немного потеряла актуальность на фоне выхода второй части, но все равно обязательна для прохождения, ведь сиквелам никогда не удается затмить оригинал.

												Dark Souls is an 'open-world' game in the vein of 'Metroidvania' titles, which is to say it's open ended but not as open ended as Western titles tend to be. The map design is such that areas are generally linear, but paths branch out at points into other linear areas, which either lead to dead ends  or to connections to previously explored areas, or a new area altogether. This design in linearity with branching paths and backtracking is synonymous with 'Metroidvania' titles. Ultimately all linear areas connect and its your duty to explore them thoroughly and keep a mental note of places you've yet to visit due to a present task, since its completion will then lead to yourself asking, ''where to next''.''Oh right, there were those two areas that I didn't explore, time to get to it''The old school comparison goes further, as the game also has a ton of secrets. This game's secrets can be divided into three categories: alternative paths in levels (self-explanatory); illusory walls (walls that, when struck, disappear thereby revealing a path); and item-environmental interactions. alternative paths and illusory walls typically contain items behind them, sometimes unique items and weaponry not attainable otherwise. ''item-environmental interactions'' are best described as items that are used/equipped in conjunction with being in a particular area. These are fewer in number, but lead to optional boss fights and optional areas to explore. There's a lot to love in a game that has a lot to uncover in addition to just straight up exploration.Dark Souls is also an infamously difficult game, a reputation that isn't entirely merited. If you die you keep everything in your inventory minus Souls and Humanity; Souls being currency for weapon upgrades and levelling up whilst having more Humanity means better resistances and more item drops from enemies. Dying even once sounds bad, but the bonfires (which work as respawn locations and checkpoints) are always spaced apart evenly and you never lose much progress when you die since, in general, you can always get to where you previously were after death in as little as 1 minute or less. As for Souls, in general losing them doesn't matter since enemies respawn everytime you rest at a bonfire, and you can easily grind them back again. Typically if you're in an area that gives you more than a third of the souls required for a level-up with each death then its beneficial to grind the area for levels rather than constantly dying and losing all those souls. With all the deaths you could've stopped dying and levelled up a bit more rather than wasting time. The idea is to not carry around a ton of souls because you will often die, but you will also often have a checkpoint just a few seconds away from your place of death anyway.It's the type of challenge that is fair and welcolmed, but also highly overrated. There were a few spots that were difficult to get past due to enemy placement and level design, but typically if the area is hard to the point of causing rage inducing deaths, then either you shouldn't be there yet or you should but are slightly underlevelled and therefore can easily grind a few levels and upgrade weaponry and armor. Don't let talk of this being THE HARDEST GAME EVER dissuade you from trying it, because it's challenging but also fair and has levelling, which can, if EVERYTHING ELSE fails, just lead to you theoretically being level 100 with perpetual grinding and beating whatever area you're presently in. Not that grinding matters anyway, you get the majority of your damage and defense from upgrading weapons and armor. Unlike most RPG's, your stats don't matter as much as you'd like them to. Weapons generally have stat requirements to wield them (typically in dexterity or strength), so your initial points will be to meet these requirements. But weapons also scale off those stats, so that mid to late game when you have a significant number of points into whichever stat said weapon scales off of, it does a lot more damage than before. So you have a dual system whereby weapon damage is dictated by its upgrades, but also by your stats. Different weapons scale differently as well; there's a rating system from S to E, where the higher the rating a weapon has on the spectrum for a particular stat the more damage it gets off said stat. This system dictates which weapons you wish to keep and wish you'd do away with (along with their attack animations), so the RPG elements and item management make this a sort of action-RPG/Metroidvania hybrid.Speaking of 'Metroidvania', I'll harken back to the point and say that just like the first few Metroid titles Dark Souls also starts with as minimal a narrative as possible, and it's to its detriment. One of the hardest things in starting the game was giving a damn about it. You get a 4 minute cutscene in the beginning vaguely talking about Gods, and are then thrust into the gameworld with a very vague, ''go ring bells plz'' objective. It's very difficult for me to really get into something when there's no plot to it. I understand that no one wants an experience that sacrifices atmosphere for 100 NPC's and 500 cutscenes with PC's strung about the land detailing 10 pages of the game's plot in each. But it's not a scenario whereby you have to sacrifice one to get the other. Dark Souls supposedly has a considerable amount of lore but good fuc*ing luck getting it all in-game in a comprehensive fashion. It's the type of lore that was pieced together by the fanbase after multiple playthroughs and really analyzing item descriptions. I assume the rest was either in developer interviews and artbooks or stuff that came in the later titles. Some is fan conjecture. It's such a shame because you can weave a narrative that takes advantage of the groundwork laid but if, for the majority that played the game, it dwindles down to, ''I gotta google it'' then you've failed to convey a story. The game's narrative is akin to walking into a room mid-conversation with three people talking, or watching the last 20 minutes of a movie; you can understand it by the end of it if you piece it together, and if you were to view it again you could understand it all moreso but it's a REALLY bad way of relaying a story. It's one of those games that starts with the assumption that you already know what's going on, and talks about what's going on here and there. In other words, something that would require multiple playthroughs and rewatching and re-reading cutscenes/dialogue scenes to understand what the creators made. Like I said, it's a failure in story-telling and what prevents something from being damn close to perfect.Plot aside everything else in the game is awesome, and if you're into the exploratory nature of Metriod titles (old and the Prime series) and are looking for an action RPG then you can't go wrong with this game. Very few games merit the praise they typically get, but Dark Souls lives up to expectations. You'll need to google the upgrade system as it pertains to weaponry, but otherwise the barrier to entry isn't as steep as you might imagine.			"

												Totalling more than 1200 coupled hours between PC and PS3, this definitely is my favourite game.While, in my opinion, the settings and the athmosphere are slightly inferior to its predecessor Demon's Souls, Dark Souls fills the gap with efficient mechanics, deep lore and a feeling of loneliness and despair that accompanies you throughout the entire story. As for the PVP aspect of the game, the community is still very alive and populated by skilled players roaming Oolacile Township. GFWL is a big detriment, but with the Steam patch coming soon all will be forgotten.Remember kids: if you're getting front-stabbed it's only your fault for not anticipating your opponent's network latency.

												Things I had to learn from this game without being explicity told aka artifical difficulty padding to prolong it. 1) Fight bosses in the nude to dodge all their attacks OR in the bulkiest max poise armor to be slow, get hit, but not be stunned and interrupted from your attacking and healing animations. 2) A small group or even just two of any generic enemy can be stronger than any boss when their hitstuns combo you from full hp to zero. High poise heavy armor shrugs off this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.3) Since bosses will kill you frequently, you'll spend much time going from bonfires to boss fights. 4) There's a hidden bonfire at the top of seth's funhouse and somewhat close to the boss bed of chaos (hidden behind an illusory wall) 5) IMPORTANT: If you input a jumping slash attack (right bumper plus up) but can't start the animation immediately (you're blocking an attack) the game will eat your input and use the thrust attack (right bumper) with horrendous cooldown and start up. The game dropping that input killed and frustrated me more than anything by far. 6) You will get one or a couple black knight weapons. Upgrade it with twinkling titanite and it will carry you to the end of the game.You will be lost, you will learn how to die, and eventually you will learn how to NOT die.			"

												This if one of my favorite games of all time with Demon's Souls as a close second and one of the best RPG games out there it can be difficult but rewarding, i especially love the freedom in character progression, how they did the lore, and the art, graphics, and character design behind the game, If you haven't beaten this game or given it at least a try your missing out on a lot. I also love the fact that when i try a new character class/build it feels like an entirely new game (there are areas i still haven't explored and classes i haven't tried) I give it a 9.5/10			"

												This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played.Combat system works well and there are plenty of options.Well, do not expect any fancy story, but just something in the style hack and slash.For me, definitely I can say that I recommend. If you do not mind learning style as a step to death then take the game. Is definitely worth every penny.Cons?  - Missing chat  - It's hard to summon a specific player to cooperation  - Weaker graphics  - Control of the mouse and keyboard sucks  - You need gaming controller (xbox360 is best)Praise the Sun!

												The game itself is amazing. This version of it is awful. Framerate runs like molasses. Theres a well known mod to fix it, which it does, but now I've lost all connectivity with online play. Cant invade or be invaded. I also cant see any player messages. Its been like this consistently since I downloaded the mod which is practically mandatory. There is yet another mod for connectivity, but I'm personally sick of jumping through hoops to play this game the way it was meant to be played. Its been years now since this version dropped and From Software isn't doing anything fix it. They dont intend to. They're just content with their most popular game being broken on pc. I do recommend it, because it is Dark Souls 1 and we dont have a choice for playing on pc, but I'm giving it a thumbs down because this is unacceptable.			"

												It baffles me that people find this game difficult.Anyways, as someone who's neither into RPGs, the medieval setting, or even difficult games, I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing this game is. The lore based story is amazing (at least if you have the observational skills to discover it.) The combat is simple yet deep with intuitive controls, timing, and telegraphs. Additionally, this is possibly the only game I've ever played where the PvP can live up to the expectations set up by the PvE (but wow do I wish there was less lag.)There are a few common complaints I hear about this game, and here are my opinions on them.""The game is too hard."" : No, the game is not too hard, it is in fact rather easy. If you find the game difficult, then it is possible that you haven't figured out what the game expects of you yet. More likely though, you need to drop the keyboard and mouse controls and get a controller.""The game is all trial and error."" : It is entirely possible to beat this game exclusively through trial and error, but wow you'd have to be pretty dull to play through this game like that. The game gives plenty of hints to warn you about what's coming up, you just need to be observant enough to notice them.""The game is clunky."" : Well, that one's just an outright lie. Unless you don't understand the concept of management (i.e. stamina management is one of the most common things players seem to struggle with even though it's one of the most important skills for this game) or are playing with a keyboard and mouse, you'll find that this game plays beautifully.

Genre: RPG/Open World If you're the person who loves challenge, and who don't mind dying a lot and also want to try new things, then you're gonna love this game. Otherwise if you're the person who plays games at easy/normal just so you can experience the game and move on avoid this. This game takes time, and to get better you need to die a lot.Gameplay(+)Gameplay is different than in other games and it doesn't feel that smooth in the beginning. Some people find it slow at first, but that's cause Dark Souls is one of the games that tries to be more realistic as far as the gameplay is concerned. Weapons/Armors: You have two slots in each hand, for weapons or shields(you can put weapon or shield in whatever hand you want). You also have armor. You can combine parts of armor sets however you want. Game offers a big variety of weapons, armors, shields etc. There are many classes of weapons: Straight swords, Greatswords, Ultra Greatswords, Axes, Katanas, Hammers, Whips, Bows and many others. When choosing armors and weapons you need to worry about their weight and your equip load. Other than weight weapons and shields also have stats requirements. Usually you need certain amount of points invested into Strength or Dexterity, or both, and sometimes you need to invest into magic, miracles etc. Some weapons scale of strength, some of dexterity, and some of both, which means that increasing those stats increases weapons damage, and also weapons have different types of scaling. You can also upgrade weapons, shields and armors with some materials and souls(souls=Dark Souls money and exp points). Magic/Miracles: Game also offers a big variety of magic spells and miracles. They have their stats requirements too. You need to invest points into intelligence/faith to increase magic/miracles attack and defense, and to be able to use those spells/miracles. There are  additional items that improve magic or miracles attack or defense. Enemies: Enemies are very creative, there are many type of enemies and a lot of them are hard to kill at first. Boss fights are absolutely amazing, and killing a boss in Dark Souls feels like great accomplishment. Game has plenty of bosses, and many of them are optional. After killing the boss you'll get souls. Some bosses also drop boss souls which you can either eat to accuire more souls or save them for later, so you can craft boss weapons at blacksmiths. Every time you die enemies will respawn at same places, but bosses won't. Once you kill them, they're dead till the next new game + cycle.New Game +: After you finish the game, you'll automatically progress into new game +, with everything that you've collected in ng. You can play ng+ endlessly, and the game's difficulty increases every time untill you reach ng+7, where it stops increasing.Some other things about gameplay: Bonfires are checkpoints in this game. Every time you rest at bonfire, all enemies will go back to their place, and all enemies will respawn, except from killed bosses. Every time you die you lose all souls you have and you need to find that same location to pick them up before you die again, unless you want to lose them forever. After dying you'll respawn at last checkpoint you had been rested. Multiplayer(+)This is one of the things that makes Dark Souls games pretty unique. You can invade worlds of other players with special items and fight them there, or get invaded in your own world. You can also call other players from their worlds by activating signs on the floor with purpose to either fight them or play co-op with them, and you can post your own signs too. This game would be a perfect game for me(10/10) if not for instant backstab. This technique ruined pvp of this game, and it's very broken, since people are constantly fishing for backstabs. Also backstab escape bug.Atmosphere(+) One of the things that makes Dark Souls so great is dark and gloomy atmosphere, that makes you feel lonely in that cruel world. Not knowing what's behind the next corner, it forces you to have your eyes wide open all the time.Story/Lore(+) Story in Dark Souls is not told in the classical way. To find explanation of the story you must listen to what NPCs have to say, and read descriptions of items, and still after that you're not gonna be able to understand a lot of things, so you must create your own theories about what happened. There are good theories on internet from youtubers like VaatiVydia, Silver Mont, Dave Control Live, TerraMantis,etc. Bad port(+-)This is really a bad port, and it's almost unplayable without DSfix which can be found here: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=684 .You can't get banned for using this, and almost every Dark Souls player uses this. Port by default is locked at 30 fps, but DSfix lets you unlock fps, and it also makes game pretty stable with improved graphic. Still some people complain that they have dips with unlocked fps and set on 60, but I really can't help you with that since I am playing on 30 fps since beginning without any problems.Note: Controller is not necessary, use what you want. Never used it in DkS series and I am pretty good in both pvp and pve.Verdict: This is an an amazing, very challenging game, and that combined with an amazing gameplay, atmosphere and lore makes it a masterpiece. Sadly it is an awful port, but there is a mod that fixes most of the issues.Personal rating: 9.5/10 "

												--DISCLAIMER--first of all, in my review the thumb doesn't matter. I could also pick a thumbs down rating, Only the text review represents my oppinion about this game, nothing else.The other thing is: I'm not someone who purely says that the game isn't possible. I'm just pointing out, what was enjoyable for me in an objective way. If you don't agree with my critics to this game, then it's fine by me. I'm not telling you what to enjoy and what not and if you actualy enjoy the things I don't enjoy, then have it your way. But then I ask you to respect my oppinion aswell as I respect yours.--DISCLAIMER END--Dark Souls is an interesting experience indeed. It always keeps you on your toes but it also gives you a break if needed.It is a challenging game without being unfair to the player, at least overall to a certain point. It is an action RPG game to my liking but, unfortunatly, it has also alot of downsides.First of all, and I'm sure everyone agrees with me is, that this is a very poor port of a game. It is a shame that there was no effort put into porting this game or even optimizing it in general, since a constant and high framerate in this kind of game is the most important aspect (timing in general). Now luckily, I have an Xbox controller for my PC and I highly recommend a controller in general for this game, since the controls on the keyboard are messed up. Now there are mods out there which help making this game playable, but I am talking about a product the developers delivered to us, not the fix that the community came up with without the developers giving a crap about there game and doing it themselves.Now the most thing I enjoyed in this game was the first playthrough. I created 2 characters and managed to play through the game with both of them with 2 different playstyles. The first character was a more tanky character with a greatsword. My 2nd character was a high lightweigth build for pure dodge and counter with a katana. The game provided me with a decent challange and, although the game has it's frustrating moments, it never made me quit the playthrough.NG+ (New Game +) on the otherhand is something I don't recommend to anyone searching for an enjoyable playthrough, simply because the difficulty scaling is to dull. Giving them more Healh and higher damageoutput doesn't mean difficulty, it just tests your patience with the game. I'd rather have smarter enemies with different attackpatterns instead of just heavylie based ""trial and error"" enemies. This counts especialy for dodge builds. In most cases, if you happen to stagger from an attack, you will die because you'll get stunlocked untill you die. While this alone is not a problem, some enemies will be more of an annoyence because of their high hitbox detection (4 Kings for example) where it doesn't matter if you dodge their swing or not you'll get hit anyway.Another positive thing about this game is that it doesn't hold you on your hand, like most games do nowadays. The game doesn't point out, where you should go now or what you should do. You have to figure that out yourself. Now the game does have a somewhat linear pattern you have to follow, but that's only at the beginning of the game and to a certain point. If you are 1/3 through the game, the whole game is open for you to explore. You can get the idea of what to do in order to progress by talking to certain NPCs, but you have to actually listen to what they say and you still have to think for yourself where you should go to do your task. The game my have cutscenes, but all of them are skipable and are not regular at all (mostly an introduction to a certain boss or if you did something significant for the story).The combat system is great overall. It is easy to learn, but hard to master. Dark Souls doesn't make you rely on the abilities of the characters (like certain MMO's or even RPGs where you just have to spam their individuel abilities and wait for their cooldown) all actions depend on the player himself and you'll get more then enough variety to that. You can for instance do a light attack, a heavy attack, a guard break kick, a jumping heavy attack, parry, block, backstab, dive attack. Most weapons also have their own move sets, giving you a large variety to pick from for you to use to your liking.But the obvious thing is that the combat system is almost purely made for 1v1 encounters. That means, if you have to deal with alot of enemies at once without having a weapon which can hit multiple targets, then you'll notice the downsides of the combat system or rather to certain enemy/ boss encounters (Ornstein and Smough are only considered to be one of the hardest bosses purely because, if you don't have any help, then you'll have to deal with 2 heavy hitting bosses at once. if you atleast get help from Solair, an NPC character, then the boss is manageable without big problems)The good thing is, that these kind of encounters are not that often and you are most likely able to lure them out 1 by 1.But areas like New Londo with ghosts, atleast on new game+, they will be a hard time if you are not able to 1hit them because they will swarm you and they have a decent range with their attack and the fact, that they can attack you through the wall makes it unnececary hard and you'll most likely be forced just to sprint your way through this area.The bosses are both the things you will enjoy the most but they will also be the most frustrating thing in the game. The statisfaction after killing a boss is very pleasing and you will feel rewarded for that aswell combined with the combat system. Most bosses are also unique in their own way, although that doesn't always mean that it's something positive. Some bosses are very easy and don't provide a challenge at all while other bosses have a huge difficulty spike and require certain strategies to work with. And some bosses are just downright tedious. The best example for that is Gwindolin. It may be an optional boss, but if you seek to play all of the game's content, then you'll be forced to one of the most tedious bosses of the game. I'm not saying that the boss is hard the boss is in fact one of the easiest bosses the game has to offer. This boss fight in particular just stretches in it's lenght in a very artificial way (you will always have to run up to the boss while avoiding it's projectile attacks and if you are in close range, you'll be able to land 1-3 strikes before the boss teleports away where you just repeat the process). I think the most enjoyable boss fight for me was Sif, the Wolf. It wasn't to difficult for me even on NG+ and it wasn't to hard either. Overall, I say that bosses are one of the best things the game can possibly offer. It is in fact one of the only reasons to why you should play the game, atleast when you are not into pvp, that's a different story.While I like the idea of being connected to different ""nodes"" and being able to see different phantoms of players who play the game aswell, this system stands in it's own way if you consider to play this game in coop. The problem is just that if you try to play with a friend, you have to hope for you and your friend being connected to the same node. If you are not, you cannot play together. Now for that there also exists a mod to help you out with and certain configurations but, that's not an excuse for such a design for online playing. I'd rather have a traditional, more working way to play the game online rather then what it has to offer now. For me, it's not a big downside for the game but for those considering buying this game to play coop, be prepared to either do alot of things to be able to play effectivly or be prepared to be patient.OVERALL: I recommend this game to those who want an action RPG with a decent and overall enjoyable experience and for those, who dare to play the game's NG+ mode for extra frustration.

												Praise the Sun!Fantastically hard experience that offers little to no hand-holding both in and out of game.  The PC port is full of issues resolved in round-about ways by community mods.  If you don't go mad trying to get a resolution above 1024x720 (Tip: google DSFix), you'll wish you would have just bought a console instead when you try to get your mouse and keyboard to work (Tip: google DSMFix).  After you wade through a SEA of options hidden away in .txt files, and troubleshoot a dozen additional problems you may encounter, you're finally off to the races!Of course, the races are probably going to punch you right in the mouth because this game can be so hard the metaphors don't even make sense.  The game doesn't tell you much, other players tell you even less, and you can throw yourself at an impossible cemetary of skeletons for hours without the game even suggesting there's an easier path.  You need to learn from your deaths quickly.  If you don't seem to be doing much damage, you're NOT going to survive so turn back and try another path!  Once you finally get on the slow, purposeful drudge to success, you'll meet all sorts of FANTASTICALLY designed monsters, see AMAZING set peices, and discover a deeply burried treasure-trove of lore.  Just keep in mind that if you want to experience the full effect of multiplayer, you have to stay human.  You can always see the fleeting ghosts of other players, and you'll find their cryptic orange messages scrawled all over the world, but if you want to meet them in the flesh you have to be living yourself.  Summon your white and golden allies whenever they offer to help.  Be wary though, others may come as an agent of chaos, as your righteous executioner, a collector of souls, or even as a guardian of nature.At least it's not using Games for Windows Live anymore!Above all, PRAISE THE SUN.

												This is one of the best games I played so far. It's not easy, actually it is one of the (if not THE) most difficult games I played. Every step of your path must be chosen wisely, you can't undo a mistake in most situations, so beware of your decisions. Every single battle is a challange and will put your patience, skill and timing to the test. Even situations in which you already excel normally might be the end of you if you're not carefull or rush too much. There are some minor setbacks, like the fact that the controls' explanations are not adapted to the computer version. Nevertheless, the game is awesome. Unlike other games, the storyline won't be given to you, except for the introduction, so be ready to find out what's happening on your own. Time to grab a sword and face the journey that will change Lordran as you know it... that is... if you're ready to die.			"

												Atrocious port, one of the best games ever made. 'Prepare to Die' is pretty accurate: the first half of the game is brutal.GameplayPretty much requires an Xbox360 controller. Mouse & keyboard controls are incredibly bad, and feel terrible even with a mouse fix mod.DkS has the best melee combat outside Mount&Blade. Every swing has weight, every hit counts. Attacks are always telegraphed well in advance: everything can be dodged with proper timing. This works both ways, and it might take some time to get used to the player's attacks not being instant, but requiring a similar wind-up that the AI has. Excellent weapon variety, with nearly every weapon having at the very least some minor unique quirk, and most weapons having full, unique movesets. The player's equipment choices are mostly personal preference: the weapons feel different and they're all perfectly viable when upgraded. Armour variety is also great, but what you wear doesn't make a huge difference. Resistances from armour are good, but dodging and blocking are far better tactics than eating hits.The magic system is a bit intimidating at first. Highly limited amount of casts, and very long casting times. Three different schools of ""magic"", all of which feel powerful and interesting. Playing a sorcerer does make the game significantly easier, especially later on when items that increase magic damage are easily available.The player character levels up by spending souls ( currency, essentially ) to level up individual stats ( strength, dexterity, etc. ). A single character can, in theory, be a master of everything. Leveling up gets more expensive every time, so most of the time it's more advantageous to plan a build in advance and stick to it. At character creation, the classes only really determine the starting equipment: the classes don't lock a character into a single path. Incredible freedom in the character development system; encourages replayability by having a massive amount of perfectly viable builds to come up with. Enemy design is, overall, excellent. They range from undead knights to giant mushrooms and clams. They all have unique movesets, and despite the AI being very basic (run at player, try to kill), the combat feels fresh when you move through the levels and encounter new enemies.The levels are (for the most part) designed masterfully. A maze, with shortcuts available everywhere. The world feels real: all the areas are connected perfectly, and highly encourage exploration. Huge variety in the design of the levels: Duke's Archive is a huge library, Tomb of the Giants, a pitch black cave full of skeletons. Some areas, like Lost Izalith, were clearly rushed and lack the complex geometry and intelligent enemy placement of levels such as Undead Burg.StoryHighly unconventional storytelling in this one. Most of it is delivered through item descriptions accessed in the inventory. If you never read them, all you'll really know is that there's a prophecy, and you killed a bunch of dudes. The story hidden in the descriptions, environment and NPC ""quests"" is absolutely brilliant, however. Having to dig for it makes figuring things out so much more rewarding than being told everything in cutscenes. There are 'holes' in the story, and those are filled by the player, and his actions. Everything in the game exists for a reason:  nothing is randomly just 'there'. I found the main storyline and the NPC stories extremely interesting, but it definitely takes some effort to be able to really enjoy.Graphics & AudioThe graphics are terrible. Looks like a console game, because this is literally a 1:1 port from the xbox360. Locked to 30fps, 720p, relatively with low res textures. All of these can be fixed on PC, though: I run the game at a 4k resolution, 60fps and with fan-made HD textures. DSFix by Durante has a bunch of variables that vastly improve the way the game looks. Well worth installing. Weapons and armour  look pretty good, but that's mostly due to their brilliant design, not graphical fidelity. The environments range from beautiful (Painted World, Ash Lake) to hideous (Lost Izalith).Sound design is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. Very little music: only plays at a central hub area and boss fights. The rest of the time, all you'll hear is footsteps, monsters and other environmental sounds. The lack of music gives the rare times it does play so much more impact. Hearing the Firelink music after a raid on the Catacombs is very comforting, and hearing boss music gets the adrenaline pumping as you face Smough & Ornstein.In conclusion,  Dark Souls is one of the greatest games ever made. It is a terrible PC version, but most of the issues can be fixed, and the result is an experience no gamer should miss.			"

												PC port quality aside, this is a VERY well made game no matter which platform you play it on.  With that in mind, let's get down to the dirty details :)For starters, one thing I love about this game is that it is relatively noob-friendly (at least it was for me having never played Demon's Souls).  Its initial linearity helps new players learn the mechanics against increasingly difficult obstacles without necessarily having to worry about navigation *most* of the time.  While the enemies are by no means easy, for Dark Souls they are very primitive and therefore, make a good introduction for the kinds of attacks you will face throughout the game.  Enemies that are initially big bosses become plentiful regular enemies later on in the game, giving a massive feeling of personal growth and achievement to the player when the enemies that used to kick♥♥♥♥♥are getting cut down one by one.The art direction in this game is extraordinarily well done.  By this, I mean how its sound design, visual style, and character design work with the underlying themes of the game to completely immerse the player.  Much of the world is filled with hulking structures worn down or destroyed, giving the player the sense that they are scavenging a once great civilization come to ruin.  There is almost never any music in the game, save for the boss fights and one area that is so awe-inspiring that it requires fitting music.  In many of the boss fights, the music is hectic and rushed, simulating the players' emotions when they just walked into a room with a giant behemoth eyeing your supple body for tenderizing.  Everything in this game looks and sounds like it wants to tear out your intestines with all manner of sharp or blunt object and wear them as various pieces of clothing.  Many of the NPCs in the game have very subdued voices and seem to be only sometimes be aware of your presence.  As the game title states, you will die and you will die a lot.  Caution is the word of the day and not paying to the environment later on in the game will prove very deadly indeed when many of the game's traps are introduced.  The story is told almost entirely through the environment, with some details being vaguely provided by NPCs.  As the story picks up with the player's journey beginning, the world has already fallen to ruin, with many of the once great heroes and gods of the time either dead or driven insane by the coming darkness.  Many (ignorant) people claim the game has no story whatsoever but paying attention to the environment is key to discovering the backstory and motives for many of the other characters ever coming to Lordan.  Some youtubers like VaatiVidya have very strong explanations for many of the characters in the game and they are incredible.The combat in the game has a very weighted feel to it.  This game doesn't have a combat system like Call of Duty where everything happens at breakneck speed.  When the player swings their sword, the character has to quickly wind up for the swing.  It isn't slow by any means depending on your weapon of choice but it definitely requires deliberate action.  The combat is very much about decision making: when to block, when to counterattack, when to dodge, even when to run away to regroup.  Don't run into the game flailing around expecting to fight like Bruce Lee, it's just going to end with your death.A topic on everyone's mind when talking about this game is obviously the difficulty.  While the game is very hard, it isn't for the reasons many people state.  As hard as it may be to understand at first, YOU are what makes dark souls as hard or as easy as it is.  Your ability to observe your environments and predict the actions of your enemies will determine how successful you are in Lordran.  Overcoming difficult boss fights is a result of your very own hard work and determination to succeed.  The game never hands you a victory, it puts your prize on the opposite end of a room filled with traps and deadly foes and tells you to take what is rightfully yours.Don't go into Dark Souls thinking you will know how everything in the game works, even after playing for a while, without consulting online information.  While the game takes a hands off approach to educating the player about the mechanics of the game and how everything works, it isn't equipped to give *any* information on some things like how invasions and coop works, as well as some stats like poise.  This is my biggest problem with the game especially when it comes to new players.  There isn't any explanation for what being human does or what benefits you gain from consuming humanity without spending it.  Without consulting online information, your experience will be much more difficult especially later on when the level design becomes less intuitive.This review is written while Games For Windows Live is still functioning and as such, I have no idea if the online will still work after the shutdown (probably not).  The game's online component is a mess, barely functioning for PvP and almost nonexistent for Cooperative play.  Thankfully, there is a brilliant mod that branches off the DSFix mod that makes coop way better than originally and that is very much appreciated especially if playing with friends.  PvP works but the amount of lag is unforgiveable in a game where losing to an invader can mean losing all your souls (currency) and a lot of progress.  98% of the time, I don't feel like anyone bested me in combat out of sheer skill, but because the latency with the servers condemned me from the start.In short, the game is incredibly well put together and while a few things need improvement and the PC port DEFINITELY could have been made better, that doesn't make the game itself bad.  Especially with the community fixes for resolution, framerate, coop, mouse and keyboard, etc. the game is downright beautiful to play.  For sure, the game is VERY difficult, but it is by no means as hard as people make it out to be.  If you want a game that can bring you immense satisfaction as a player, you absolutely must buy this game.  One of my favorite game series of all time and I would recommend it to anyone who has the balls to overcome real challenge.  Incredibly deep and immersive, this game is a MUST BUY			"

												Great game, buy it and give it a try.There are so many things to love here. Let's get into it.The Story/Lore:Very open-ended, you have to piece it together bit by bit from item descriptions and bits of dialogue from NPCs. But the world that Miyazaki created is really cool. Each area in the world has its own story and every character has his/her own adventures. It is quite beautiful.The Looks:Each seperate area in the game has its own unique feel. Different areas are populated with different enemies and scenery, and every area does feel quite unique. The graphics are quite good, nothing groundbreaking, but will make you stop and stare sometimes. The character models and enemy design are fantastic and really help you immerse yourself in the world.The Sound:The music is very fitting and certain tracks really do stand out. But for the most part I find myself more or less ignoring the music in the game. The sound effects are fitting and immersive, and are really useful for being aware of your surroundings. Nothing really to rant or rave about here. The Gameplay:This is where this game really shines. The gameplay is very polished. The combat feels very plausible. There is a give and take, a flow to the combat. For the most part, you can't just go in flailing your sword around or spamming spells out the wazoo. You have to be careful, take calculated risks, and know when to fall back. The leveling system is fantastic. 1 or 2 levels won't really make a difference, so grinding is unnecessary. Besides hitting weapon or spell requirements, level is not a huge indicator of power. This makes pvp interesting and low-level runs possible. The wide variety of different character builds has kept me playing this game for so long. From a pure caster to a tankish wall to a dexterous fighter with the support of miracles, you can have fun with a wide variety of playstyles.			"

												The famously difficult Dark Souls has the ability to burn images into my head and conjure up powerful emotions with its carefully-presented story. It is both bleak and beautiful, and is one of the most impressive games made in recent years. Thematically, Dark Souls is about death and perseverance in an unforgiving world. This is echoed in the gameplay by a near-complete lack of guidance; for example, techniques critical for success go completely unexplained, like how to kindle bonfires (and what that even means). Thus, community involvement such as reading guides or walkthroughs is a must. The online elements within the game are also helpful, but the game is just as much fun to play offline.If the inaccessibile presentation wasn't bad enough, it turns out that Dark Souls really is too hard. I'd probably enjoy playing it more often if it weren't so repetitive (dying and repeating the same segment over and over again). Frankly, I have the most fun late in the game, when I've powered up enough to explore new territory and take on bosses with relatively few deaths – you know, like a normal game. On the whole, I still can't deny how absorbing and satisfying the whole experience is. There are so many fascinating details hidden away that are exciting to uncover. I love the powerful images, tense moments, and sense of accomplishment that comes when my perseverance pays off. Dark Souls is not for everyone – not by a long shot – but for those who can get past its steep learning curve and cruel difficulty, it can be a wholly unique and inspiring experience. (Rating: 9/10 “Great”)Notes: I played this PC version with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. It is nearly identical to the PS3 version of the game I played before, and comes packaged with the Artorias of the Abyss DLC.			"

												I bought this game out of curiosity during the last Steam Winter sales for less than 6€, after having read many reviews over the years, and I must say that it is well worth the money. Let’s get straight to business: DS – PTDE is a 3rd Person Fantasy Action-RPG, directly ported from the Xbox360 and PS3 version. The setting is a standard high-fantasy medieval world with lots of undeads, demons, lizardmen, dragons, knights in black or shiny armors of all sorts, but the lore and plot is rarely mentioned at all throughout the playthrough, as you mostly play alone (or with friends/other players in online co-op) with very rare encounters with sentient NPCs which can offer a little bit of insight on your mission and objectives. Game progression is almost non-linear: after having beaten the first obligatory “tutorial dungeon” you character reaches the first (and only) main quest hub and is given the generic mission to “fulfil the prophecy and ring the two Bells of Awakening”, with absolutely no clue on how to proceed: it is the player’s duty to start exploring the world and find a way to progress and clear a path, and this is where the real fun begins. Even if you have been living under a rock for the past 2 years and have read no other review of DS – PTDE, you will understand one basic concept during the first 10 minutes of gameplay: as the name itself implies this game is INSANELY HARD. The developers have intentionally designed it to challenge the player at every turn, with absolutely no mercy even for beginner’s mistakes (even in the tutorial dungeon you will die A LOT during your first playthrough). Some examples, just to give an idea:-          No save-load mechanic is implemented: the game autosaves your position and progress basically after every action you perform, causing every gameplay choice to become instantly PERMANENT. Did you just killed a NPC with a fireball by accident due to him being too close to a menacing skeleton? That NPC will be permanently DEAD, even if this means losing access to his wares (in case he was a merchant) or to a side quest. You will have to find another way around the locked door or find someone else to sell you those precious arrows you were looking for… The good news is that the developers have literally thought of everything, so an “unwinnable” scenario is virtually impossible to achieve (without cheats), even if you mindlessly slaughter every living and undead being in sight (including merchants and questgivers)-          Even if your character is cursed with the undeath and technically cannot die, every single hostile monster or NPC can single handedly♥♥♥♥♥♥you and send you back to the spawn point with little effort. Even the least menacing zombie, armed only with a broken sword, can AND WILL kill you a dozen time if you do not remember to dodge his attacks or keep your shield up the whole time. Underestimating any encounter, even when overgeared, will lead to the usual YOU DIED screen in few seconds-          If you are so lucky and brave to reach one of the various checkpoints placed at various strategic locations, and use it to rest and replenish your forces before proceeding EVERY SINGLE MONSTER YOU HAVE KILLED UP TO THAT MOMENT WILL RESPAWN (with the exception of bosses and minibosses), leaving you stranded in the middle of a dungeon with no way to get out without fighting your way back to the beginning. There is no turning back in DS – PTDE, sorry-          Is it also worth mentioning that being killed will result in the same effect: respawn at the checkpoint and a horde of fresh monsters to fight all around you. Oh, did I mention that spawn points are usually very far from bosses, punishing the player even more for deaths during boss fights?Although the above points could be interpreted as lazy or poor design, the reality is that DS – PTDE is one of the best balanced games I’ve played in many years of PC gaming: every encounter and situation can be easily won by using the correct strategy and taking advantage of the weakness of the enemy; if you are rushing through an area while swinging your sword or throwing fireballs without any care for the surrounding environment you will soon be overwhelmed and the familiar YOU DIED screen will be shown. A tactical approach, with perfect knowledge of the surroundings (to avoid the frequent ambushes) and the correct gear combination will increase your survival chances immensely, and some boss fights will even become trivial with the correct strategy.Of course this implies a trial-and-error process, but there is a reason why this game is called “Prepare to Die Edition”.Unfortunately this game has also blatant flaws, and the most important lies in the graphic engine: being a direct console port (made by a SW house which was specialized only in console titles with no PC experience) you can forget about HD resolution, smooth framerates and all the eye-candies of a typical PC AAA title. But it is even worse: the PC version of DS – PTDE is locked to 720p resolution and 30fps, IN 2014! You know that 3500€ gaming rig that you just bought and that runs BF4 at ultra in Surround on 3 27” monitors? It is completely wasted since you will experience the same resolution and detail of a 2005 console anyway.And what about mouse and keyboard controls? Forget about them, as all the menus and in game text refer to Xbox360 control layout and using a M+K combo will be a frustrating experience (Steam even has a warning on the store page claiming that a 360 controller is strongly recommended for this game).Luckily for you, my friends, the modding community has solved this issue since a long time with two brilliant an small pieces of software: DSFix and DSMfix (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix and http://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/864979455329386779/). After a very simple setup process you will be able to enjoy the game on your PC as it should have been since release, with full HD graphics, 60+ constant fps (with the possibility of downsampling to push the detail even further, if your rig can take it), SSAO, MSAA, FXAA, smooth mouse controls and customizable keybindings. Last but not least, there is also a co-op fix called DSCfix which improves the experience of online co-op play over the standard GFWL junk (http://sdrv.ms/128mNwY).TL;DR version:PROs-          Very challenging gameplay, but never too difficult to become unbeatable. If you die too much, it is generally your fault-          Longevity (50+ hours of gameplay for a single playthrough, with the possibility of New Game+ with increased difficulty!)-          Endless combinations of character growth and gear allows for very different approaches, all equally rewarding, to the game-          A sequel is in the works!CONs-          Direct Xbox360 port: use of unofficial mods is mandatory to make the game playable-          Awkward game controls with M+K (also fixed by a mod)-          Absurdly steep learning curve-          Some gameplay mechanics are obscure unless google is used (e.g. crafting)-          Even with mods the graphic engine does not take advantage of all the possible features of a modern gaming PC			"

												I like this game. Good lvling system, story is simple but same time epic. Lore is shrouded to mysteries. Many weapons, armors and spells. Also different kind of covenants are fine. But there are shadows in this games shining glory: Hackers, Lagstabbers and Disconnecters, not to mention IP pool system. Which will make your life very much hell. Also those player made ""dueling rules"" are not what this game was supposed to be. This is supposed to be Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition not Gentle Souls: Prepare to Bow edition.I would rate 10/10 but with ""shadows"" i will give 8/10I recommed this game to those with patience and are really prepared to die.

												This is one of the best games I played so far. It's not easy, actually it is one of the (if not THE) most difficult games I played. Every step of your path must be chosen wisely, you can't undo a mistake in most situations, so beware of your decisions. Every single battle is a challange and will put your patience, skill and timing to the test. Even situations in which you already excel normally might be the end of you if you're not carefull or rush too much. There are some minor setbacks, like the fact that the controls' explanations are not adapted to the computer version. Nevertheless, the game is awesome. Unlike other games, the storyline won't be given to you, except for the introduction, so be ready to find out what's happening on your own. Time to grab a sword and face the journey that will change Lordran as you know it... that is... if you're ready to die.			"

												The Good: Unique difficulty, unique setting, and unique gameplay.Difficulty relies on skill in combat and evironment awareness, unlike modern games that rely only on damage modifications, and, or enemies with infalable aim. The setting doesn't rely on set pieces or glorified hollywood cutscenes to sell itself. The Bad: Lackluster PC port, and Games For Windows Client requirement.Low resolution textures riddle the game, mouse and keyboard support is nonexistent, or at the very least horrid, resolution render is capped at 720p, and framerate is capped at 30fps. Conclusion: Install DSFix mod, DSCFix mod, and High-res textures from Nexus website, and I'll guarantee you'll have a damn good time with this game!			"

												PC port quality aside, this is a VERY well made game no matter which platform you play it on.  With that in mind, let's get down to the dirty details :)For starters, one thing I love about this game is that it is relatively noob-friendly (at least it was for me having never played Demon's Souls).  Its initial linearity helps new players learn the mechanics against increasingly difficult obstacles without necessarily having to worry about navigation *most* of the time.  While the enemies are by no means easy, for Dark Souls they are very primitive and therefore, make a good introduction for the kinds of attacks you will face throughout the game.  Enemies that are initially big bosses become plentiful regular enemies later on in the game, giving a massive feeling of personal growth and achievement to the player when the enemies that used to kick♥♥♥♥♥are getting cut down one by one.The art direction in this game is extraordinarily well done.  By this, I mean how its sound design, visual style, and character design work with the underlying themes of the game to completely immerse the player.  Much of the world is filled with hulking structures worn down or destroyed, giving the player the sense that they are scavenging a once great civilization come to ruin.  There is almost never any music in the game, save for the boss fights and one area that is so awe-inspiring that it requires fitting music.  In many of the boss fights, the music is hectic and rushed, simulating the players' emotions when they just walked into a room with a giant behemoth eyeing your supple body for tenderizing.  Everything in this game looks and sounds like it wants to tear out your intestines with all manner of sharp or blunt object and wear them as various pieces of clothing.  Many of the NPCs in the game have very subdued voices and seem to be only sometimes be aware of your presence.  As the game title states, you will die and you will die a lot.  Caution is the word of the day and not paying to the environment later on in the game will prove very deadly indeed when many of the game's traps are introduced.  The story is told almost entirely through the environment, with some details being vaguely provided by NPCs.  As the story picks up with the player's journey beginning, the world has already fallen to ruin, with many of the once great heroes and gods of the time either dead or driven insane by the coming darkness.  Many (ignorant) people claim the game has no story whatsoever but paying attention to the environment is key to discovering the backstory and motives for many of the other characters ever coming to Lordan.  Some youtubers like VaatiVidya have very strong explanations for many of the characters in the game and they are incredible.The combat in the game has a very weighted feel to it.  This game doesn't have a combat system like Call of Duty where everything happens at breakneck speed.  When the player swings their sword, the character has to quickly wind up for the swing.  It isn't slow by any means depending on your weapon of choice but it definitely requires deliberate action.  The combat is very much about decision making: when to block, when to counterattack, when to dodge, even when to run away to regroup.  Don't run into the game flailing around expecting to fight like Bruce Lee, it's just going to end with your death.A topic on everyone's mind when talking about this game is obviously the difficulty.  While the game is very hard, it isn't for the reasons many people state.  As hard as it may be to understand at first, YOU are what makes dark souls as hard or as easy as it is.  Your ability to observe your environments and predict the actions of your enemies will determine how successful you are in Lordran.  Overcoming difficult boss fights is a result of your very own hard work and determination to succeed.  The game never hands you a victory, it puts your prize on the opposite end of a room filled with traps and deadly foes and tells you to take what is rightfully yours.Don't go into Dark Souls thinking you will know how everything in the game works, even after playing for a while, without consulting online information.  While the game takes a hands off approach to educating the player about the mechanics of the game and how everything works, it isn't equipped to give *any* information on some things like how invasions and coop works, as well as some stats like poise.  This is my biggest problem with the game especially when it comes to new players.  There isn't any explanation for what being human does or what benefits you gain from consuming humanity without spending it.  Without consulting online information, your experience will be much more difficult especially later on when the level design becomes less intuitive.This review is written while Games For Windows Live is still functioning and as such, I have no idea if the online will still work after the shutdown (probably not).  The game's online component is a mess, barely functioning for PvP and almost nonexistent for Cooperative play.  Thankfully, there is a brilliant mod that branches off the DSFix mod that makes coop way better than originally and that is very much appreciated especially if playing with friends.  PvP works but the amount of lag is unforgiveable in a game where losing to an invader can mean losing all your souls (currency) and a lot of progress.  98% of the time, I don't feel like anyone bested me in combat out of sheer skill, but because the latency with the servers condemned me from the start.In short, the game is incredibly well put together and while a few things need improvement and the PC port DEFINITELY could have been made better, that doesn't make the game itself bad.  Especially with the community fixes for resolution, framerate, coop, mouse and keyboard, etc. the game is downright beautiful to play.  For sure, the game is VERY difficult, but it is by no means as hard as people make it out to be.  If you want a game that can bring you immense satisfaction as a player, you absolutely must buy this game.  One of my favorite game series of all time and I would recommend it to anyone who has the balls to overcome real challenge.  Incredibly deep and immersive, this game is a MUST BUY			"

												The famously difficult Dark Souls has the ability to burn images into my head and conjure up powerful emotions with its carefully-presented story. It is both bleak and beautiful, and is one of the most impressive games made in recent years. Thematically, Dark Souls is about death and perseverance in an unforgiving world. This is echoed in the gameplay by a near-complete lack of guidance; for example, techniques critical for success go completely unexplained, like how to kindle bonfires (and what that even means). Thus, community involvement such as reading guides or walkthroughs is a must. The online elements within the game are also helpful, but the game is just as much fun to play offline.If the inaccessibile presentation wasn't bad enough, it turns out that Dark Souls really is too hard. I'd probably enjoy playing it more often if it weren't so repetitive (dying and repeating the same segment over and over again). Frankly, I have the most fun late in the game, when I've powered up enough to explore new territory and take on bosses with relatively few deaths – you know, like a normal game. On the whole, I still can't deny how absorbing and satisfying the whole experience is. There are so many fascinating details hidden away that are exciting to uncover. I love the powerful images, tense moments, and sense of accomplishment that comes when my perseverance pays off. Dark Souls is not for everyone – not by a long shot – but for those who can get past its steep learning curve and cruel difficulty, it can be a wholly unique and inspiring experience. (Rating: 9/10 “Great”)Notes: I played this PC version with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. It is nearly identical to the PS3 version of the game I played before, and comes packaged with the Artorias of the Abyss DLC.			"

												I bought this game out of curiosity during the last Steam Winter sales for less than 6€, after having read many reviews over the years, and I must say that it is well worth the money. Let’s get straight to business: DS – PTDE is a 3rd Person Fantasy Action-RPG, directly ported from the Xbox360 and PS3 version. The setting is a standard high-fantasy medieval world with lots of undeads, demons, lizardmen, dragons, knights in black or shiny armors of all sorts, but the lore and plot is rarely mentioned at all throughout the playthrough, as you mostly play alone (or with friends/other players in online co-op) with very rare encounters with sentient NPCs which can offer a little bit of insight on your mission and objectives. Game progression is almost non-linear: after having beaten the first obligatory “tutorial dungeon” you character reaches the first (and only) main quest hub and is given the generic mission to “fulfil the prophecy and ring the two Bells of Awakening”, with absolutely no clue on how to proceed: it is the player’s duty to start exploring the world and find a way to progress and clear a path, and this is where the real fun begins. Even if you have been living under a rock for the past 2 years and have read no other review of DS – PTDE, you will understand one basic concept during the first 10 minutes of gameplay: as the name itself implies this game is INSANELY HARD. The developers have intentionally designed it to challenge the player at every turn, with absolutely no mercy even for beginner’s mistakes (even in the tutorial dungeon you will die A LOT during your first playthrough). Some examples, just to give an idea:-          No save-load mechanic is implemented: the game autosaves your position and progress basically after every action you perform, causing every gameplay choice to become instantly PERMANENT. Did you just killed a NPC with a fireball by accident due to him being too close to a menacing skeleton? That NPC will be permanently DEAD, even if this means losing access to his wares (in case he was a merchant) or to a side quest. You will have to find another way around the locked door or find someone else to sell you those precious arrows you were looking for… The good news is that the developers have literally thought of everything, so an “unwinnable” scenario is virtually impossible to achieve (without cheats), even if you mindlessly slaughter every living and undead being in sight (including merchants and questgivers)-          Even if your character is cursed with the undeath and technically cannot die, every single hostile monster or NPC can single handedly♥♥♥♥♥♥you and send you back to the spawn point with little effort. Even the least menacing zombie, armed only with a broken sword, can AND WILL kill you a dozen time if you do not remember to dodge his attacks or keep your shield up the whole time. Underestimating any encounter, even when overgeared, will lead to the usual YOU DIED screen in few seconds-          If you are so lucky and brave to reach one of the various checkpoints placed at various strategic locations, and use it to rest and replenish your forces before proceeding EVERY SINGLE MONSTER YOU HAVE KILLED UP TO THAT MOMENT WILL RESPAWN (with the exception of bosses and minibosses), leaving you stranded in the middle of a dungeon with no way to get out without fighting your way back to the beginning. There is no turning back in DS – PTDE, sorry-          Is it also worth mentioning that being killed will result in the same effect: respawn at the checkpoint and a horde of fresh monsters to fight all around you. Oh, did I mention that spawn points are usually very far from bosses, punishing the player even more for deaths during boss fights?Although the above points could be interpreted as lazy or poor design, the reality is that DS – PTDE is one of the best balanced games I’ve played in many years of PC gaming: every encounter and situation can be easily won by using the correct strategy and taking advantage of the weakness of the enemy; if you are rushing through an area while swinging your sword or throwing fireballs without any care for the surrounding environment you will soon be overwhelmed and the familiar YOU DIED screen will be shown. A tactical approach, with perfect knowledge of the surroundings (to avoid the frequent ambushes) and the correct gear combination will increase your survival chances immensely, and some boss fights will even become trivial with the correct strategy.Of course this implies a trial-and-error process, but there is a reason why this game is called “Prepare to Die Edition”.Unfortunately this game has also blatant flaws, and the most important lies in the graphic engine: being a direct console port (made by a SW house which was specialized only in console titles with no PC experience) you can forget about HD resolution, smooth framerates and all the eye-candies of a typical PC AAA title. But it is even worse: the PC version of DS – PTDE is locked to 720p resolution and 30fps, IN 2014! You know that 3500€ gaming rig that you just bought and that runs BF4 at ultra in Surround on 3 27” monitors? It is completely wasted since you will experience the same resolution and detail of a 2005 console anyway.And what about mouse and keyboard controls? Forget about them, as all the menus and in game text refer to Xbox360 control layout and using a M+K combo will be a frustrating experience (Steam even has a warning on the store page claiming that a 360 controller is strongly recommended for this game).Luckily for you, my friends, the modding community has solved this issue since a long time with two brilliant an small pieces of software: DSFix and DSMfix (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix and http://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/864979455329386779/). After a very simple setup process you will be able to enjoy the game on your PC as it should have been since release, with full HD graphics, 60+ constant fps (with the possibility of downsampling to push the detail even further, if your rig can take it), SSAO, MSAA, FXAA, smooth mouse controls and customizable keybindings. Last but not least, there is also a co-op fix called DSCfix which improves the experience of online co-op play over the standard GFWL junk (http://sdrv.ms/128mNwY).TL;DR version:PROs-          Very challenging gameplay, but never too difficult to become unbeatable. If you die too much, it is generally your fault-          Longevity (50+ hours of gameplay for a single playthrough, with the possibility of New Game+ with increased difficulty!)-          Endless combinations of character growth and gear allows for very different approaches, all equally rewarding, to the game-          A sequel is in the works!CONs-          Direct Xbox360 port: use of unofficial mods is mandatory to make the game playable-          Awkward game controls with M+K (also fixed by a mod)-          Absurdly steep learning curve-          Some gameplay mechanics are obscure unless google is used (e.g. crafting)-          Even with mods the graphic engine does not take advantage of all the possible features of a modern gaming PC			"

												Gentlemen, I love PVP. Gentleman, I... love PVP. Gentlemen, I so love PVP.I love parrying. I love riposte. I love backstabs. I love havels. I love buffs. I love fast roll. I love drinking estus. I love invasions. I love hosts losing.On the bridges, in the anor londo, in the archives, in the forest, in the Oolacile, in the Depths, in the Painted World, in the Lost Izalith, in the Catacombs, in the Undead parish.I cherish each and every pvp can be waged in this game.I love the thunderous roar of asses, when casuls lose to the giant dad.My heart dances when the asses of enemy troops are hurled into the air in pieces from pursuers.I love it when a Havel smashes gankers with its giant club. It left a warm feeling in my chest when hosts would jump screaming from the blazing Giant Dad only to burn down lava.I love it when the gankers overrun the enemy , while hitting him with a staff. It moves me when I remember the sight of a cheater in a state of panic, stabbing an already dead enemy over und over with infinite stamina.I can hardly contain myself thinking of hanging the scrubs. And it is superb when the enemy undeads screams in time... with the roars of infested barbarians that smash them with boulders near Quelaag's domain.And those newcomers from sales that fought us, even though they used ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Drake Sword. I even remember how I one shoted their entire group with dark bead.I love russian players thrown into disorder. It is a very sad thing when their beloved npc's they should have protected to the death are killed by none other than them.I love the English and American builds being crushed and annihilated. Their creeping about on the ground like vermin, chased by the Magic spammers, is the height of humiliation.Gentlemen, I wish to see a war worthy of one in Hell itself.Gentlemen, gravelords, darkmoons, darkwraiths... Pray tell, wat do you wish for? Do you wish for PVP as a matter of course? Do you wish for a merciless, shitlike PVP? Do you wish for a stormlike conflict which runs the gamut of blowing steel and striking flame, killing every host in 3000 worlds?""Invade! Invade!Invade, invade, invade!Very well. Then let it be PVP. All our strength is held in a chaos zweihander, poised to strike. But for we who have continued to endure a whole year in the depths of mom's basement waiting for a PC release of Dark Souls... a simple PVP is no longer enough!! A GREAT PVP!! One born of our single-hearted devotion!!We are merely one gank battalion, no more than a thousand troop invaders. But each and everyone of you has min/maxed to match hardened veterans and count as a thousand. So gentlemen, together we are an army as powerful as a million and one regular invader. Let us rouse those slumbering ones who drove us into the realm of forgetfulness. Let us seize them by the hair, drag them down, open their eyes and make them remember. We shall make them remember the taste of terror. We shall make them remember the sound of our var boots. We shall remind them that something in the interval between heaven and earth they don't even recall with their own philosophy does indeed exist.			"

												A very good game, where you will die. A lot. And it's all going to be your fault, and you will feel it, and you will be angry about it. But it pulls you back, to play more, to defeat that boss that kills you in two hits. And when you finally succeed... Well, good luck for the next one. It's even harder...			"

												Oh my god, I think I'm gona die..... Dark Souls is undoubtedly the hardest game (and in my opinion, harder than Demon's Souls) of this generation. The gameplay is great, the game involves strategy and thinking to beat the powerful enemies, taking one hit can cause lots of damage and sometimes instant deaths if your not careful. You WILL die alot, and you will have to restart on parts you have gone so far... but completing the area will reward you greatly and you will become stronger. Bosses are a highlight of the game, they are like no other in other games, they are very challenging. This game is amazing in every aspect, challenging and rewarding. I have problems with the PC version thought...First, it is a port, this game runs terrible and laggy without using a mod called DSFix. With DSFix, you can do many game adjustments with it.Second, without DSMouse fix, you can't play with mouse and keyboard.Third, since it uses GFWL, it has ENORMOUS amount of hackers, making its multiplayer features extremly risky to use.I still recommend it thought as most problems are fixed using mods and its obviously still controller compatible.Get this game if you want to start a challenge :D			"

												After playing this game whole, dying alot, enjoy it on some parts and raging unendlessly i have come to a point where everytime i meet someone new i'll ask them if they played Dark Souls, and if they haven't i'll just recommend it to them.It's one of these games that everyone is talking about, you take a look, hate a first but give it a second try and you'll treat it like a cup of coffe, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ afficionado.The first thing that you'll be noticing are the awkward controls that function awkwardly well, if you aren't playing this on the PC of course.Press R1 for light attack, R2 for a heavier strike, Y to dual-wield that may look useless at first but heck this is necessary as f*ck. Press B to roll and hold B to run.I have left Dark Souls for quite a long time, bought it in 2012 and only came to finish it in 2014 and dude, i have not forgotten what any of the buttons do.People say Dark Souls's story is crap, that it has no story, well tell that to Hidetaka Miyazaki you little piece of♥♥♥♥♥ you wouldn't trust yourself.Infact, the Dark Souls story is so well designed it gives me cancer, and look, a story has never given me cancer before.The characters itself tell the story, the bosses, heck, even the monsters do! Everything make sense if you explore further in the game, NPCs will tell stories and some monsters will be different, many secrets to be found, not something that was written on a book and making it easy to read, i'd even say Dark Souls is a interactive book where you write your own path, with circumstances if you kill an NPC or on the choices you make, they will come hit really hard later like electricity bills.The combat is realistic in its kind, it's not realistic in real-life realism level.Let's say, how do you attack with a spear in this game? you just f*cking rush with it at an enemy, i have seen a video on youtube that judges Dark Souls' combat and he tells only the truth.With many different weapons to wield, each weapon with a different skillset, different moves and abilities, it feels like every single weapon is different, let's put it like that, you are in a pet shop and can't decide which kitten to take home!The graphics are artistically beautiful, not photorealistic beautiful, with some photobumping that got my eyes stuck in amaze and how the armour is really shiny too, shields reflect light and your armour just feels like gold. The scenary is quite the thing too, but not that beautiful too, though since the PC-port was so poorly optimized, the community makes everything better, goddamit From Software i hope dark souls 2 will come out decent as journalists say.Dark souls is a one-in-a-kind game with unforgiving difficulty, if you do a mistake on combat ur dead m8. Ratings would give it a 10/10, i'm giving it my own personal score you swine, i'm giving it the 'Dark-Souls level score', that means it's good, yes.			"

												I originally played Dark Souls on the PS3 back in 2011 at launch, coming from Demon's Souls after about 100 hours or so, I was quite excited and avoided a lot of pre-release material, and all I could say was wow, and I still feel that way, if I were to add up the amount of time I've spent playing Dark Souls on PS3 and PC, I would estimate that I've put 1,000+ hours into the game, I also obtained the Platinum Trophy on PS3 for the game.Nowadays, it seems a lot of developers are getting more scared to take risks, particularly the bigger guys making AAA titles, this is understandable as these companies will either stick to a winning formula, or follow the trend of what people are buying and liking, From Software on the other hand, has strived to make games that they find fun, rewarding, complex, varied and memorable, in this regard, Dark Souls 1 is a gem, and one of my all time favourite games.There is absolutely a learning curve if you've never played the game(s) before, but once you get past this, you'll be surprised at really just how easy it is, knowledge is power when it comes to the Souls games, and as you obtain knowledge about the world, the weapons, the crafting system, the magic, general equipment, enemies, bosses and environments, you will be asking yourself ""why is this game considered so hard again?"", just as I ask myself at this point when I play through it.There is fantastic level of variety in all aspects of the game, when it comes to the enemies and bosses you encounter, the weapons you can use, the different armour sets, the spells and miracles you can obtain, the locations and environments you come across and travel to, it all adds up to make you want to push on and master the game, and once you do obtain that level of skill, you'll understand why this game has such a hardcore, passionate fanbase, and one of the most dedicated in gaming as a whole.In terms of character variety, Dark Souls has a system we calls ""builds"", basically there's different starting classes to choose from, each of which starts off with different stats and equipment, frankly, this only matters for the beginning of the game, typically I will personally start off with a Knight, and then level my stats in other areas to make a highly proficient Spellsword character, I have made other builds as well, but stat investment is VERY important, weapons in the game also have what is called ""scaling"", and as well as leveling up weapons with the brilliant crafting system, this scaling aspect will affect the damage you can do with a particular weapons based on your stats, so for example, a ""Dexterity"" or ""Dex"" weapon, like a Scimitar, will have a high ""Scaling rank"" (Like ""A"") when it comes to the Dexterity stat, meaning that the more you level Dexterity, the more damage you will do with that Scimitar, scaling ranges from S (the best) all the way to E (the worst).As far as the story goes, mainstream reviewers criticized this part of the game for being non-existent, and this is not the case, the basis of the story is explained in the opening cutscene, but the story and lore in general present themselves in a more mysterious way than most games out there do, they present themselves through item descriptions, NPC dialogues, and through emotion and general feeling, by simply paying attention to what is going on while playing the game, it's a superb way of telling a story and uncovering the rich lore of the game, you'll find yourself making connections from one item description to another, and coming up with your own theories for what may have happened, if you look at VaatiVidya or Epicnamebro on YouTube, you'll see that the story and lore are extremely deep and interesting, and we all certainly had a lot of fun putting the pieces together back in 2011 and beyond, even today, we continue to come up with new theories and we continue to discover new things about the game, which is incredible.The Multiplayer of the game is incredible and super unique, it hosts a realtime MP system which can be accessed without the need to go to another menu, the MP relies on the use of in-game items including a ""White Sign Soapstone"" (in order to place your personal ""sign"" down and be summoned to help another player in their own world), and a ""Red Eye Orb"" which will allow you to invade and attempt to kill another player in their world, there are other items in the game that allow for MP interaction, and co-op of up to 3 players can take place, the MP system can make for some extremely fun scenarios and some epic and fun battles.The general sound in the game is amazing and perfectly fitting, everything sounds just as it should, the music that plays during boss battles is incredible, emotional and very varied, I have nothing to complaint about in regards to the soundtrack, it is amazing.As far as the PC version goes, it was disappointing at launch in a lot of regards, for technical reasons mind you, it lacked a lot of the basic features a PC version of a game should have, such as high resolution and framerate support, however, a brilliant modder named Durante has since implemented a modification called ""DSfix"" which allows the game to run at higher resolutions and 60fps (albeit with a few issues when it comes to the higher fps), and also support for texture mods, some of which I use, anyone has access to this tool and it's simple to download and install.Overall, I cannot recommend Dark Souls enough, if you are a fan of Fantasy Action RPG's with a dark tone, mysterious story, incredible enemy, boss, level design, beautiful visuals, amazing art design and style and insane variety in weapons, armours and just about everything else, you owe it to yourself to play this game, continue to get better at it and master it, and just have a whole load of fun while doing so, experiencing a new world that doesn't herald YOU as its omnipotent master from the get go, but forces you to earn that spot, should you want it.If you are quite intimidated and would like a pretty understandable rundown and tips regarding the game, I suggest looking at Rurikhan's video ""Dark Souls for Dummies, 10 Tips"" on YouTube, which you can find right here -

												A game well worth the frustration. Sure, the PC port may not be that good, but with a bit of searching and some mods it'll work fine. You'll probably still want a controller though, as the STORE PAGE warns in big friendly letters.A game worthy of the time put into it to learn it, dying each time will imbue your victories with that little bit of extra sweetness. If you haven't tried it yet and if you're a fan of action RPGs or difficult games, this is well worth the money. I'm hooked for life, and I can't wait for Dark Souls 2.			"

												As the game title says, prepare to die. And when the developer says, you should really do that, because you're going to die, big time. Death in this game is like one of the main characters: you're going to encounter it as much as you possibly can imagine. The game is as straight as an arrow, but the level-design left me speechless. Bosses are hard, enemies are smart, riddles are tricky, death is around every corner almost every time. The game overall could be too hardcore for your average casual gamer, but it's certainly worthwhile. One of the best action-RPGs of the 2012. I'd give it 9 out of 10.			"

												For me Dark Souls is one of my all time Favorite RPG´s. Yes you will Die you will Die a lot but the rewarding feeling when you kill the Boss after numerous atempts is something you don´t get alot of todays Games. Anyone who is up for a fair challenge and is into RPG´s should try it.Review after my first Playtrough on PC (done multiple runs on Console before).Pros:- Unique Level and Boss Design.- Great Art Style.- Highly Rewarding Combat.- The World is very rich of Lore but not forced unto the Player. I would recommend VaatiVidya´s Lore Videos on YouTube for anyone Interested. Cons:- Graphics are a little dated.- The qualtity of PvP highly depends on both Players Internet Connection.Warning: The Port from From Software is really bad. I played it with the DSfix mod wich bumps up the Framerate up to 60fps and adds useful Keybindings. Done my Playtrough with an Xbox One Controller.Sorry for the bad Language im not a native English Speaker :)			"

												It reminds me of games from my childhood. Enemies are tough, resources are limited, and you need to be able to get from point A to point B without dying. I spent 4hrs at Capra Demon, defeating him only with the help of a kind soul (that soul later invaded me and tried to kill me, but I shut that sucker down). If you die, you have to restart at the last checkpoint and kill everything all over again. If you use a resource and you die, you don't get that resource back. Enemies are tough enough and fight well enough that you actually have to know how to fight and how to defend yourself in order to survive. As frustrating as this game is, it's extremely satisfying and fulfilling to overcome a challenging enemy. Remember that game from your childhood where you spent so much time trying to get through one area? Remember how you felt when you finally beat it? You'll get that same feeling in Dark Souls.			"

												I’m fairly late to the Dark Souls party however once I started playing the game I could not stop playing, from the clumsy yet once mastered combat, it is extremely fun. I did a lot of research into the game such as weapons, armours and so on but a lot of the discovery of the game has to come from just actually playing the game. I read that “so-so” weapon was great and “this was terrible” but learned that I loved this weapon for its ability to do this, and hated that weapon because it was too slow and so on.  The story:The Story in Dark Souls is interesting, like many RPG games the lore is very deep with a strong and rich backstory to almost everything. You have to dig for all this however, searching online for the lore is the easier way to go about doing that so that’s what I did. The main story in the game however starts with you, whatever you are, man or woman and you can choose a class of a Mage all the way to the Knight, or a poor naked scrub. These affect how your character starts and how to can effect the work around you. You start in a cell, and are allowed free by grabbing a key from a hallow. After escaping you are thrown into the jaws of Dead Souls pretty violently though if you have any experience with games like this before you should easily grasp the ropes of the game. The rest of the Story is mainly about you completing quests and overall to beat the main boss. That’s all i will really say on this however.Gameplay:The gameplay is a classic RPG structure with Dark Souls combat system that is designed to be tricky but with trickery, come mastery, and once you master the combat in Dark Souls nothing can stand in your way.Many times you will encounter enemies, countless huge bosses and even real players who invade your lands and try to take your souls, however if you beat them, you can take their souls so the game has some gamble in it. Please be aware however the game has a scaling system that in my own opinion doesn’t really work. Sometimes I was thrown against high-levels who I was skilfully better than, however due to armour and weapons were no match for. Then I was thrown against enemies that didn’t know how to block and were cut down faster than wood so the imbalance was annoying however extremely exhilarating. When a player joined my game to duel I got a very high rush of adrenalin, will he be good, will he be bad and fights were often extremely intense and amazing. I’m not a very big PvP person but this game has the perfect combat system for such a PvP system.My only issue with the game it’s self is guiding. The game is open world however that’s all you are told, you must pay attention in all cut scenes to know what to do and even then sometimes it’s a guess so yeah, I don’t like handholding, but this game is a bit like those mothers who leave there children and supermarkets and drive all the way home, make dinner and then realise, however by this time the child’s already been beaten to death &♥♥♥♥♥♥♥several times and found his way back home already. But welcome to Dark Souls is the common reply hahaha. Graphics:This is when I can start getting picky with the game. The graphics are nice however the game is locked at 30fps and I believe is still locked at the rendering limit and is upscale. Please note however you can download a mod that fixes both issues. For the experience I chose against that but I’m going to download them now and play the game again at 60fps and non-up scaled res.The art style of the game is very well done. The game is very dark however (again you can download a mod to fix that) one of the greatest things about the game is the Physics system however, a lot of destructible environmental objects is always fun for some known reason and sometimes event he buggy corpse ragdolls when you run past them and they get stuck to your foot and fly in the air as you run always brings a smile to my face.So overall, I loved Dark Souls. The game is not the hard-case I’ve been told but the game has its challenges (Just saying. ♥♥♥♥ the Crystal section, invisible platforms can die in hell. They are cheap deaths and I find them to be a very lazy developer’s way of adding difficulty to the game.) Apart from the 30fps lack, 1024xsomething up scaled res and that specific level I have literally nothing to bad to say about this game I absolutely love it so much I actually played the game for 12 hours straight.I will give the game a strong 9/10 - It lost that extra 1 for been a poor port. Mainly in the eyes of 30fps, it may not bother some, and in this game it's not a ballache to watch however more is always better. Oh and it looses points for Cheap deathts, even in very hard games, its lazy and unwanted. *puts up middle finger*Pro’s:-	Great combat system once you get it down-	Strong lore, great RPG roots-	Great weapons and armours along with designs of them are incredible -	Great built in physics system and large amount of bosses and enemies-	Good PvP system, still needs some tweaking however.Con’s:-	30fps Lock and up scaled res-	Cheap deaths-	Reused bosses (only some, I don’t mean mini-bosses either)-	The game is sometimes very confusing.

												Dark SoulsThe game Brings me nostolgia back from Playing Megaman and or Castlevania, its a taste of Mastering mechanics and levels to Progress. The world is full of lore,Misery and Despair. Every NPC you meet is either fooling you or on your side, and their stories unfold as you progress, for better or for worse.Though Dark souls is hard, you may only need to  learn mechanics to play, pay close attention to the armours you pick up, the Weapons you find and build a character that Suits you. The game does not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you, if you die you know why you have died.The Integration of Invading/summoning mechanics with Story or lore is a awesome part of the game! either summon a friend via Online to help or Invade players to duel them or Stop thier Progression...PvP is really really Fun and is a great End game.THough Sadly the Game is a bad port and DSFix is needed to fully enjoy the game along with the Online Fix and a 360 controller, But honestly it is worth it. IT IS A CRIME that the game was a bad port for the art work and imagination of the game is Wonderfull.I can see my self putting in another 300-500 hours into this game if i was not 1 year late to the party and if Dark souls 2 was not around the corner, though i will be PvP'ing to pass the time ;D 9/10 would Praise the SUN!

												wt r u, a casul?...On a more related note, with Games for Windows Live dead and this being on sale for 5 bucks, it's worth the pick up... as long as you don't count the half-dozen controllers you are liable to destroy in the process... The graphics are rather poor for 2011, but don't let that get you down. Dark Souls is a carefully crafted experience that you can only really fully grasp the first playthrough. Many players wish they could go back and re-experience their first time playing.  The replayability of the game comes in the diverse weapon choices and character builds, as poking enemies to death with a dagger is way, way different than swinging around a gigantic two-handed blade and, well, crushing them, I suppose. If you want the intended experience, I suggest starting your first playthough as the Warrior, as its a well-rounded character with a decent starting equipment set, and choosing nothing (or the Pendant... don't talk about the pendant! Please!) as your starting gift, as the items, which you can acquire in the game itself, are really powerful at the start of the game. So, what are you waiting for? We only want your precious Humanity...			"

												So I bought this game for $6 a few months ago just to see what all the fuss was about.  70+ hours later I can say this is one of the most challenging and rewarding gaming experiences I've had in a very, very long time.  The game's not for the weak-willed and can be very frustrating at times, but that's a part of the experience.  If you're looking for a game that doesn't hold your hand, that beats you down with no mercy but makes you feel like you've truely accomplished something great give this game a try.I can also say a couple of months ago Dark Souls 2 wasn't even on my radar.

												A great game that brings back a nostalgia of retro games where your not hand held or pampered with helpful tips, equipment or directions in the beginning. All you understand is to move forward and expect the unexpected. On a side note, the freaking tutorial is a boss fight that I did not understand how to beat until I saw the opening to an exit to get a sword and shield. An appreciation on not just on what it delivers, but for the players who traverse through the undead burg or  through the sewers of the depths and onwards to blighttown or Anor Londo, the experience is like no other. Each environment is a unique set piece with its own enemies and pathways to take. I remember reaching the firelink shrine the very first time and unknowingly heading down towards the New Londo Ruins only to be demolished by ghosts. This gives you a fair warning that your not equipped to travel through the area yet, but a bit sight seeing of what to expect later in the game can always help your conscience.Finally, the boss battles are some of the most exciting and frustrating thing about playing this game. Patience is key and learning the patterns and weakness of the enemy can go a long way. I've found sometimes even the mini bosses can be a handful because they can surprise you when entering a room and rush you unknowingly. Although I may have started playing this game at the latter end of its release (not even a quarter of the way through), I will definitely be looking forward to preordering Dark Souls 2 for the PC.

												One of the best games I've ever played. When this came out on the 360, I had no media knowledge of it (I recommend this for most hyped games) and came in completely blind. I got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked up and down because I thought it was a hack and slasher, obviously there is that but its much more controlled and precise. Pros:Level design - There are hardly any loading screens during the entire playthrough of this game, maybe a handful. The first 75% of the game is chock full of beautiful interconnected environments, and you will not get tired of running through them when you inevitably die :)Combat - Very visceral and precise. You will be punished harshly for using the last of your stamina and missing that risky shot. There is dodging and rolling which give you the tools to dance around your enemies if you are skilled, but even a skilled player can easily be overwhelmed by an over aggressive group of enemies. One of the best parts of the game.Enemies - Great variety of enemies and bosses, both challenging enough to not get tired out quickly.Online play - Theres nothing besides boss fights that gets my heart pumping like my world getting invaded. These invasions keep you on your toes and give you such a rush when you kill your invader as well. The messages and summoning are also great aspects of the online play, with overused and sometimes witty messages popping up to describe the levels around you. If you find an area to hard, summon a friend! Unfortunately summoning in some places is hard because there simply aren't enough players to find (especially within certain level ranges) to summon for a boss. Each boss is definitely killable via solo, but O&S boss will be tough if you cant find a co-op partner.Dying actually matters in this game as well, so the sense of riskiness is always present when holding a large amount of souls and youre trying to decide whether or not to cash them in or save up more.Cons:Framerate - The framerate can get a little bogged down sometimes, especially in Blighttown. It was way worse on the 360 though.The last sections of the game feel rushed and are not nearly as good as the rest (75%) of the game. This is not a huge con though because for the most part its great.Lack of summoning in some places due to lower player counts is somewhat of a negative, especially if youre having a hard time with the boss.All in all this game is a must buy for RPG fans, if you dont own it and youi call yourself one then please revoke your badge until its in your library :)			"

												Dark Souls is a splendid realization of an action RPG, beign well refined under both the aspects. Action gameplay includes dodging, parrying and blocking, while every weapon - and there are a lot - has its own moveset, multiplying the fighting possibilities against many different enemies.The ambientation is dark and criptic; a deep and imaginative creature design builds a stunning dream-like atmosphere, while short npc dialogues and hidden plots clothe the adventure in a curtain of indifference. The map is like a Rubik's cube: hidden connections and intricate geometries enrich every area, and at the end of the exploration, the whole path scheme is elegantly resolved. The game is hard to master and requires a high level of concentration, because mistakes and superficiality are punished, in 99% of the case, with instant death. In addiction, no kind of help nor indications are ever provided to the player, which have to try and learn by his own. Controls and camera are unfortunatly badly developed, eventually leading to some gameplay obstructions, while hitboxes needed a better precision.New game plus and lots of way to customize characters extend the game experience to hundreds of hours, as every game run might have a different evolution.Beign a true and solitary challenge, with little rewardings and tons of game over, DS is made for real gamers.90/100			"

												A great game that brings back a nostalgia of retro games where your not hand held or pampered with helpful tips, equipment or directions in the beginning. All you understand is to move forward and expect the unexpected. On a side note, the freaking tutorial is a boss fight that I did not understand how to beat until I saw the opening to an exit to get a sword and shield. An appreciation on not just on what it delivers, but for the players who traverse through the undead burg or  through the sewers of the depths and onwards to blighttown or Anor Londo, the experience is like no other. Each environment is a unique set piece with its own enemies and pathways to take. I remember reaching the firelink shrine the very first time and unknowingly heading down towards the New Londo Ruins only to be demolished by ghosts. This gives you a fair warning that your not equipped to travel through the area yet, but a bit sight seeing of what to expect later in the game can always help your conscience.Finally, the boss battles are some of the most exciting and frustrating thing about playing this game. Patience is key and learning the patterns and weakness of the enemy can go a long way. I've found sometimes even the mini bosses can be a handful because they can surprise you when entering a room and rush you unknowingly. Although I may have started playing this game at the latter end of its release (not even a quarter of the way through), I will definitely be looking forward to preordering Dark Souls 2 for the PC. A video for people who are interested in getting into the game at Dark Souls 2 -

Dark Souls: Prepare To Die EditionThis is by far the best game I have ever played in a long time, everything about it is perfect and keeps me playing for hours.  But it didn't start like that.  When I first got this game, I was bad and it was frustrating.  Death after death to the first boss made me want to stop playing, but I didn't, I kept trying and trying until I found out what I was doing wrong.  And when you finally beat a boss after 20+ failures, you get an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment, it drives you to keep playing to find out what's next.  You will spend the whole game dying, learning from your mistakes, and feeling proud of yourself once you've mastered a fight and beat a boss.  All I can say is don't get discouraged, the game will get easier the more you play, trust me.  I used to suck and now im on NG+8 and I don't suck as much anymore. :D10/10 Dark Souls Best Game "

												100% one of the best/hardest/rewarding/fun games i have played this generation. Tutorial was a harsh, But then instanly after completing it, You are tossed into the wilderness basically having to choose your own path not knowing what and where to go. Gameplay is great and Grpahics are also pretty good.It also has a form of co-op and PvP which plays a big role in this game. I would mainly recommend this game to peoplethat have stable online connection, Don't get angry and give up fast and likes RPGish games.The games Lore is brillant and the map design and boss/enemy designs and placements are done really well.I highly recommend playing this game before Dark souls 2 as its the better game XD.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 8/10Atmosphere: 9/10Online play: 8/10 "

												NOTE: Get DSFix to change the game's internal rendering resolution to whatever you like and unlock the FPS to 30 or 60. Oh, Dark Souls. The hardest game ever to hear some people talk, but in all honesty, the game's difficulty is vastly overstated. Yes, it can be brutal, and yes it's going to drop you into a big mean world full of intimidating uglies that want nothing more than to paint the walls with your warm red fluids, but NOTHING in Dark Souls is insurmountable. It's a game that merely plays on some of your worst habits as a player of games and will punish those who think they can rush things their first time through. It's tough, but fair. Combat comes down to analyzing your enemies, knowing your weapon and defenses, and managing your stamina. You don't need an overpowered build to win any encounter, just awareness and the ability to react. Nearly every piece of equipment in the game is viable and allows the game to be played pretty much however you wish. (Just don't put ANY POINTS AT ALL into Resistance. It's pointless.) This is definitely not the kind of linear stat progression and equipment system most RPGs present players with, and the game feels much more satisfying overall since you have so much of a say in how you want to defend yourself.Being dropped in fresh will be overwhelming at first since the game provides no real direction on how you need to progress, but exploring the dreary and imposing world of the undead is rewarding in itself. You'll never know what's around the next corner, but that's part of the fun. It's hard to think of many other games so focused on atmosphere and discovery these days in the same ways that Dark Souls is. I can get why the game may not necessarily appeal to everyone, but those who can tough out those initial few hours are in for an immensely rewarding experience. One of the generation's best, right here.			"

												Easily one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. Challenging, but well worth it. Every victory feels extremely awesome. Some pretty interesting customization in fighting, play style, magic, weapons, armor, etc. Really incredible lore - if you manage to pay attention. Every item/area/piece of equipment/enemy/boss builds on the lore in the game, none of it is just spoon fed to you. Definitely 10x better with a controller. All in all it's an amazing, well worth game that will have you pushing yourself to beat each new boss. Also, the open world is pretty awesome - you can do the game in almost any order you want. Great graphics as well, especially if you download the free DS Fix mod.10/10 for this game.			"

I'll parrot what countless others have said before me: This game is really reward in the sense that you'll feel an immense satisfaction once you figure out how to overcome the various obstacles you'll meet. You will be challenged, but the feeling of completing those challenges is exactly what this game thrives on.			"

												This game is dated, slow, and can't run properly without installing a mod. That being said, this game great. It's a fun ARPG that puts your skills to the ultimate test. Yes, this game is hard. Yes, you will die. Yes, it's kinda the point. Every death you learn about the game. That boss that dunked you with his buttslam attack you didn't know he had? Now you know he has it. That well-hidden boulder trap that rolled down the stairs to crush you? Now you know where to find it, and when to run. The challenge is there, but so is the knowledge and learning to overcome it with your own power.Any RPG character you want to make, you can probably make it here. Poison Fist Monk? Spell slinging Magic Knight? Zweihander Champion of the Giants? Fire breathing, ninja flipping Dragon-Ninja hybrid? Check, check, check, and after grinding to get Dragon Scales, check!The visuals in the game are awesome. The enemy, level, and boss design feels unique and original in each area you visit. Blighttown is a toxic swamp of gloom and despair, Anor Londo is as prestigious and clean as it is controller breaking. The lighting bolt spitting snake people in Sen's Fortress. The greataxe wielding Taurus Demons of Lost Izalith. Gravelord Nito is terrifying, Ornstein and Smough are badass and powerful, and Artorias of the Abyss is one of the best bosses I've ever fought in a video game. They're all there to kill you and look cool doing so.The game rewards exploration as well. There are tons of side paths and secret areas that lead to weapon upgrades, new spells, and extra souls to level yourself with. If a boss is too hard, try another path in the area. Grind up some souls, maybe you'll find a new weapon to bash their brains in with!If the game really is too hard, try some Jolly Co-operation with a friend! I actually find the game more fun (and less brutal to my blood-pressure) when I tear down a naked-demon-spider-queen together with a friend.I've finished three playthroughs of the game (two co-op, one solo). My two major complaints are the lack of dual wielding and the game not running at 60fps (Dark Souls HD Remaster Fromsoft please please please). You CAN dual-wield weapons, but it's not very good in this game. Thankfully the sequel fixes that.TL;DR: Game is hard. Game is fun.			"

“I just wanted to see the plot” - kasuparuBRIGHT SOULS: Prepare to Smile Edition1. I am a casualI don’t play games because they are challenging. I want games to have the plot, thoughts or feelings for me. After 100 hours of play I discovered that Dark Souls is about overcoming own inability and impatience. Player character power depends on player’s ability and skill. You learn to be calm and try again. This reminded me of the race mission in Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven before the patch came out. I learned how to drive in 2 weeks. The patch lowered the difficulty, and added the Skip button. Casuls.2. “Do it with a RockBand controller, then we’ll talk”I played using mouse and keyboard. Developers of DSFix and DSMFix made it possible, huge thanks! It is much more comfortable for me, and allows to control the camera at the speed and precision I want to. I almost never used camera lock-on on an enemy. Lock-on makes you move slower, and the camera messes up if the target dashes or jumps. If there is anyone telling you to use the controller, disregard, and play the way you want.3. Check or FoldI did not like how the game increases stakes by promoting to be human. I was hollow most of the times, soloed all bosses. On the bright part, I was never invaded. I used guides a lot. Did not spoil anything for me, the game is still challenging.Top-3 hardest bosses (NG): Capra & Dogs, Ornstein & Smough, Artorias & RNG.Top-3 locations I hate: Tomb of the Giants, Blighttown, Duke’s Archives.I blazed through New Game+, enjoying New Game++ or another run.

												So I was walking around the burg when a van drove up next to me.  The driver stopped the vehicle and spoke to me, asked if I would like to earn some souls through what he called 'jolly co-operation'.  Being new, and in desperate need of the SL, I graciously accepted the offer.  He gave me some white key and told me to go around to the back of the van and unlock it.  Upon doing so, he suddenly burst out and attacked me.  I jumped away, trying to strike back, but the man easily parried my blow, riposting back with a hard fist to my gut.  Crumpling to my knees, he then kicked me down and rolled me onto my stomach, then proceeding to backstab me over and over again with his estus flask, arms outstretched above his head, shouting out PRAISE THE SUN! between ragged breaths.  It was the worst experience of my life.10/10			"

												Much have been said about this game's difficulty, and while it is hard, it's not impossible and is rarely unfair. It has a deep combat system that's precise, easy to pick up, but takes time to master. It's set in one of the best designed worlds in video games; Lordran. A mysterious and often beautiful world that at the same time can overwhelm you with fear. How the areas in this world interconnects is just mind-bending genius. There are so many ways to play this game that it never gets old no matter how many times you play through it. A masterwork.			"

												I played this game all the way through the first non-tutorial boss. this includes a big detour fighting some skeletons in a graveyard for about an hour before my friend told me that those things should have been killing me and I was supposed to go the other way. Basically the whole thing is a giant patience test, where the only way you ever die is by being greedy and wanting to end an encounter sooner by getting more hits in. When the only way you can lose is if you're anxious for the central gameplay to be over with sooner, there's something seriously wrong in the game's design.If this game is challenging, it's after the first boss, who I beat on the first try because he telegraphed everything like mad.If this game is atmospheric, it's after the first boss, because I just had generic medieval castle to go through.If this game is rich or deep in story, it's after the first boss (and an NPC who talks to you a while afterward), because I still have no idea what the series is about or how anything is supposed to work (including a lot of gameplay elements, for which there is no written information anywhere - wiki walks are fine for sandbox games but just annoying in a beat 'em up).If a game doesn't give me a reason to play it by the end of the first real area, then either it has nothing to offer, or it's stringing me along instead of respecting me as a customer. Either way DS1 was a huge letdown and I really don't get all the hype.In a word, the game is ""tedious"", and I'm amazed at how many people seem to confuse that with ""difficult"". It's difficult to force yourself to play in a way that will win, because you'd rather play in a way that seems fun but gets you killed. This is not the kind of difficult that a video game is supposed to be.Pick it up on sale as a casual time-killer but look elsewhere if you want a game that actually wants you to have fun. If you're looking for a challenge in the same general genre, I recommend Rogue Legacy.			"

												Before I begin, I would like to point out that I bought this game originally a couple years ago on Xbox 360, before I decided to get into PC gaming. I easily have over a thousand hours in this game on Xbox, and although I come back to this game often on PC now days, I have played it SO much that there is nothing new left for me. This game is, in my opinion, probably the BEST aRPG ever made.......EVER!There are many amazing things about this game, that I will list here:* The amount of character customization is staggering.* The fighting mechanics are arguably unmatched by ANY other game.* The story is very deep and full of lore. It is in NO WAY thrown in your face, in fact it's quite the opposite, in that you will need to literally search through every item description and NPC conversation, in order to figure out what is happening in this decrepit land known as Lordran.* Monster Design is arguably unmatched by any other game* After you have played through the game multiple times, Dark Souls' PvP adds a whole new layer of replayability to the game, easily adding many more hours of enjoyment to the game. * PvP is actually mixed in with PvE, in that other players can 'Invade' your world if certain conditions are met, and this greatly adds to the feeling of hopelessness and despair that the Developers have masterfully crafted into this game. There's so much more about this game that is literally too hard to put into words. I just ask that if you give this game a chance, (you better!) that you ACTUALLY give this game a chance. It will seem awkward, or hard at first. You will die, but if you can push through the first couple areas in this game, you will become addicted, I guarantee it. The only Cons that I see PC gamers taking issue with would be:* KB/M controls are broken, making a controller strongly recommended. However, there are mods that help fix this. * If you buy and install this game, it will NOT run correctly on any PC unless you also download and install DSFIX. [www.nexusmods.com] You MUST download and install this, and the 5 minutes it takes to do so fixes the game. * There are not many options for graphics in the game itself, however, exploring the .ini files included in DSFIX will provide any PC gamer with many of the graphics options that we are used to. Please do not take these cons as a reason not to buy and play this game, you would literally be missing out on the BEST aRPG ever made. Seriously, just buy it already! :D "

												Dark Souls will be remembered as a masterpiece that dared to go back to gaming’s roots and doing so perfectly. Away with regenerating health, minimaps and other forms of handholding. Lordran is an unforgiving world that wants you to take risk and learn from its brutal nature. The game will kill you… a lot. But as you die you will learn and eventually die a little less and overcome its obstacles giving you a fulfilling feeling of accomplishment. In other words Dark Souls is a hard game. But that’s due to its unforgiving nature that punishes every mistake if you don’t play by its rules. I played it on PS3 and even though the port has some obvious issues, I have enjoyed it just as much. This game is still a gem, and I can only encourage anyone to give it a fair try.  "

												One of the most intimidating games that i played so far. Dark Souls is an interesting game that its praised for its difficulty, but thats what makes it a great game, since overcoming those obstacles that the game puts you constantly makes you feel overwhelmingly satisfied. The most interesting thing about this game is its meaning since its very similar to real life and it has very interesting philosophical concepts. Its hard to pinpoint what truly is since every player experience it differently and its open for interpretation, and the story is hidden. Though the most common philosophy i can find is existentialism. By that i mean that not everything has meaning in Dark Souls. The player starts as a hollow, which is a state that a being is cursed and will not die and the Undead slowly lose their mind and consciousness. In order to become human they need humanity or else they delve deep into madness and pain. Humanity makes you into a human form but every time you reverse the hollowing you lose some part of your self (existence). For me the hollow-human state resembles a lot with Albert Camus ""The Myth of Sisyphus"", since how much you try to escape or in this case to die peacefully you can't, and then comes the realization of the absurd. Just like Sisyphus you are destined to progress through the world (Lordran) and discover some kind of meaning if there is any. Another thing about hollow state or rather Dark Souls itself is an allegory for depression. Dark Souls in general is a very depressive and sad game but the hollow state is a resemblance to it since the more you go hollow (feel pain, sadness, sorrow, misery and not doing anything about it) the more you lose your self in depression. The game makes a good example on how you should progress and fight this state of mind just like in real life to overcome all the difficulties and hard times that we are faced.The NPC's in this game have all really sad stories(and most of them die and you are unable to save them) which makes you feel very compassionate, and understand their suffering. To dwell more on my interpretation a good example is a NPC called Solaire which has a quest to find the Sun(The Sun as a metaphor for hope and meaning), but the more you progress in the game you will see that Solaire is losing his hope and will to fulfill his quest to find his Sun and slowly becomes hollow(you can save him but he is still affected). The story is hidden in Dark Souls and you have to read item descriptions to learn something about the lore of this game. The design is one of the best aspect in this game since everything is interconnected and that makes it to be a more immersive experience. Also the game has a PvE and PvP aspect hence becoming a human will activate the PvP and you might get invaded more often in your game world, but another interesting thing is that by playing the game your character feels lonely and everything is against you, helping someone in PvP for a boss or from an invader is very satisfactory and the game encourages cooperation more. Though the most interesting aspect i find for this game is that it doesn't make you important(rarely for a video game to do that), rather you are there like many others who ventured in that unwelcome world to find their meaning or to simply don't go hollow.This game was a present surprise and i really enjoyed it, i recommend it to everyone who wants to play a meaningful game. In short:Pros:+Gameplay +Design+Immersion+Difficulty+SoundCons:-Capped 30 fps (Needs DSFix)-For those using mouse (Needs dsmfix)			"

												Dark Souls brings back the toughness in games. Remember playing Zelda on the NES? Remember how hard it was to find everything as a kid? Remember dying and going all the way back to the beginning just to start over and have the determination to finish? That's what Dark Souls brings back. It's not like your typical game like Skyrim where you can save 4 seconds before dying and just come back to life and fix your mistake 2 seconds later. You die, you cry. Everywhere you go, you're absolutely terrified and nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself at the slightest change in atmosphere. But when you achieve whatever it was you were trying to do, you seriously ♥♥♥♥ your pants and punch your baby in the face in joy. You scream at your wife and tell her you want a divorce.

												Dark Souls is probably one of my all-time favorite games. It's challenging but fair, features immersive gameplay, interesting lore, a deep combat system, and there are so many viable combat styles that you could play through this game over and over again without it getting stale.This being said, it's not a perfect game. There are some bosses and areas in the second half of the game that are blatantly unfinished, and the netcode can be iffy when it comes to latency, however the good aspects greatly outweigh the poor ones.

												You will loathe yourself for playing this game. Let me explain: it is the most sadisticly addicting games ever created. Let me furher explain: This game will test your skill as a gamer and you patience as a human being. Its challenges are numerous and seemingly endless. You will die and die and die again then, probably, hurl your remote (or keyboard, I'd highly recomend a remote though) across what ever space you are playing in and swear that you will never play it again... But then like Rihanna you come crawling back begging for more. The worst thing about all of this is that even though it will make you want to rip your teeth out, you'll love every second of it. The feeling of finally figuring out how to beat a challenge is so amazing at times you might feel like throwing a small party in celebration, and the rush you get when beat the game (your tormentor for the past many hours of game play) is even more so. You will be hard pressed to find a gaming experience as thrilling and rewarding as sDark Souls, as soon as you start playing it will become your most hated addiction.			"

												One of the ""harder games"" in recent years that was put into limelight. This is not atypical easygoing role-playing adventure. Your health means little, your armor and weapons can break, and death comes real easily if you careless. Learn to defend, dodge, and parry to protect yourself against dangerous enemies that will stand in your way as you travel through the dark world of Dark Souls.  If you plan to go online, others may invade your world and hunt you down, but you can do the same as well. You may also meet up with friendly strangers to engage in jolly co-op, if you are into it.8/10 Will die again.			"

												I deleted my old review because I gave it unjustly more than likely due to rage. I've played a good amount, the part i was stuck on was the Tarus Demon and the part after that where it involved a knight and some random hallowed in a pincer attack. After taking a break for many months and then retrying it. I've progressed to the first bell. I don't know what the other reviews state when they ran into bugs, problems and etc. I have an unmodded version and it runs just fine. Sure the mouse/keyboard should be fixed but to be honest I don't mind using a 360 controller. Regardless here is my review.The game will in fact not hold your hand. The will game anally ravage you over and over again over a picket fence. The game is unforgiving. The game will destroy you.But do you know what the good thing about it? Every time I finally over come my rage, calmed down adn thought about it. Thought about how I could improve. Thought about how I was doing something wrong. The more times I tackled it. I got better and better at parrying especially when I went to kill Havel. I felt pride and joy. I feel so happy and better than I even got to the first bell. Now supposely that was the ""easy"" part of the game as my friends have stated but you know what? I am waiting for the challenges. I played all day on 12/16/2013 perhaps I only made it pass the butterfly moth, the belfry gargoyles and even rang the first bell.I will tell you the game is very hard but can easily overcome with patience and it pays off. You'll feel very accomplished at every victory. If you like a challenge then please get this game and play it. I await for DS 2.The only part I don't get is why you have to follow the laws of physics(aka if you use a long sword and hit a wall while attacking your sword bounces off and your attack doesn't land) but yet the AI can ignore it. Sure it makes it difficult especially since the AI for basic minions can be very stupid and I can see why they would set them to ignore it but perhaps they'll make better AI and you can use your terrian to stop a black knight from swinging while you keep prodding at him or even that he choses not to swing but prod at you rapier style instead of full blow swings. But regardless this part doesn't matter because I usually get a spear and one sword on hand so I can switch as needed rather it's a narrow hallway or not a narrow hallway.Beat the game.... Kinda disappointed at few bosses and kinda disappointed at the ending.... Still a good challenge and I still enjoyed it.			"

												It may be tough, and it may make you cry, but between the scenery and the difficulty, it is a beautiful and challenging game. The detail on the buildings, Anor Londo specifically, is to die for (since the things in the place might kill you anyway!). It is a tough game, for sure, and should not be sat down with while in a mental state that says ""I will be good at this, better than anybody else, and I will beat it."" You will more than likely end up frustrated in the end. The pc port is iffy, albeit playable (but makes the game a lot harder), but with a controller it's equal to playing the console version of the game. The major downside to this game is that when trying to either invade or summon, it is a hit and miss. You can either get lucky and summon/invade on the first try, or anything that isn't lucky, and be sitting for 30 minutes to an hour trying to summon your friends. (I'm not sure if this also happens when trying to invade.)Overall, the game is great and I can't wait for the second one, which will have better ports!			"

												I like this game because it lets me be the adventurererer that is going to save the world by lighting things on fire and backstabbing people in the face feels good because when you are fighting somethign for a relay long time and they have too much hitpoints its unfair because they do more damage and when you die in the game you die for real because the game keeps telling me YOU DIED so I should be dead but im not dead because when you die you are hollow and when you are hollow that means you are empty inside but I dont feel empty inside because i am not crawling in my skin because that would be stupid and edgy and those lyrics really dont mean anythign at all but so grimdark and emo and that genre kinda sucks but so are most 90s kids so when you light all the fires you save the world of Darke soulse because you are the chosen undead but i dont get why youre called undead when youre still alive but i wish i didnt have to kill laurentis or lose solaire because they are nice people in a really sad place and its sad because when you help the onion guy be a hero he realizes that you are a better hero than he is and i was sad that the sad painted world hurt so much because of all the terrorists holding this dragon giant cute girl but maybe they were freidsnd all along so its not fun killing them because can you smell what the rock is cooking.

												Dark Souls.... doesnt the name just make you cringe?! Well, it shouldn't! People will play games forever, whether it's marbles or Dark souls, but either way, somebody is gonna rage quit! some people will play a video game just to 'Beat' it. However, this game does it a little different.... instead of giving you a choice of beating it or not, it decides for you - and it's never in your favour! This game beats you.... to a pulp.... then runs you over in it's car.... and gets it's mates to help beat the crap out of you.... not even exaggerating a little bit! But why should that scare you off? It's just a game right?Wrong, ♥♥♥♥♥♥!This is more than a game, it's an achievement, an accomplishment, a challenge and a test for all gamers out there!This game is not reccomended for those who are prone to rage quitting, and it's definately not for the faint at heart!'But what's the point if im just going to die all the time?'Shut up, you're adopted! let me tell you what's in store for you!The rewards may be a few souls and a weapon.... but thats in game! Inside your head you have just played the same part of the game about 500 times, and you've died equally. You were about to walk away when you gave it one more shot! finally, you got the SOB down to its last bit of health and you stabbed it right in the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You stood with your head held high when you finally killed that boss and you made it known that you owned it and you had intercourse with it's mother while shouting at the screen. The satisfaction levels are over 9000, and you could even say that you smiled after so much anger and frustration.... and trust me when i say that THAT very smile feels amazing!this game will take you a LONG time to finish..... the first area..... let alone the whole game! but it's not about time, its about how much you want it! it's about your desire to accomplish something! You can say to your weaker friends 'Hey look noob, i finished Dark Souls! what did you do in the last 600 hours of your life?'having said that, this game IS NOT a waste of time at all! if you play for an hour and dont even get to a new bonfire (Checkpoint [Very Rare]) dont decide it's no use, just keep trying.... there are more secrets in this game the illuminati dont even know whats going on!! Look for shortcuts, try new areas dont get caught in a rut!So yeah, thats what i think anyway! please consider playing this game (If you can get it working on steam [Need a games for windows account]) Dark Souls..... You are worthy of nothing less...9.3/10Dylan Burton			"

												I deleted my old review because I gave it unjustly more than likely due to rage. I've played a good amount, the part i was stuck on was the Tarus Demon and the part after that where it involved a knight and some random hallowed in a pincer attack. After taking a break for many months and then retrying it. I've progressed to the first bell. I don't know what the other reviews state when they ran into bugs, problems and etc. I have an unmodded version and it runs just fine. Sure the mouse/keyboard should be fixed but to be honest I don't mind using a 360 controller. Regardless here is my review.The game will in fact not hold your hand. The will game anally ravage you over and over again over a picket fence. The game is unforgiving. The game will destroy you.But do you know what the good thing about it? Every time I finally over come my rage, calmed down adn thought about it. Thought about how I could improve. Thought about how I was doing something wrong. The more times I tackled it. I got better and better at parrying especially when I went to kill Havel. I felt pride and joy. I feel so happy and better than I even got to the first bell. Now supposely that was the ""easy"" part of the game as my friends have stated but you know what? I am waiting for the challenges.

												Can be unforgiving at times but is never unfair. Feels pretty rewarding when you beat it and has very good armor and weapon design. If you like non-linear and challenging games that don't constantly hold your hand and allow for many secrets to be found through exploration then this is for you.One of the best games I have ever played, wouldn't recommend it without a gamepad though, it controls horribly when played with mouse and keyboard.

												Dark Souls is one of the greatest games ever made.  The game manages to excel in terms of mechanics, atmosphere, immersion, lore, design and replay value.  All of this is achieved through tense dungeon crawling impressive enemy encounters, a seamlessly intertwined world, extremely rewarding challenges, complex weaponry and magic, and the flexibility to play the way you want through character customisation.  The online component is an improvement over its 'spiritual' predecessor Demon's Souls, though perhaps at the expense of the dread and feeling of loneliness that Demon's Souls provided.  You are able to aid or hinder other players as well as take part in a thriving community of duel based combat. The world is massive and seamless.  Doors open shortcuts to areas you previously visited hours before and the further you explore, the more hidden areas await.  The game encourages deep exploration with challenging gameplay simply being a consequence of the setting instead of a focus (something the sequel simply failed at understanding). The game is not perfect though and I do still believe that Demon's Souls is better.  The game requires some modding to improve performance and despite an impressive online system, it simply fails to work 100% of the time and can be frustrating.  I still highly recommend the game.

												   Lots of people complain about this game being hard. Some of them even say it's too hard, but this game is like any other game in terms of dificulty. The only job you have here is learn the game: you need to learn enemy movesets, and your own, parry times, when to dodge or when to tank, if you can tank, and you need to learn enemy placements. Never just run into a place thinking you can dodge and speedrun first time.    I've played this game on the 360 for a lot longer than 140 hours, and my time on PC just adds to it. The game developers knew just where enemy placement would be perfect, and in what amount so that when you lost it was your fault. Not all areas and bosses feel this way, ""Bed of Chaos"", but the majority of the game is fair. I've personally seen people get stuck at the tutorial boss. It's not unfair difficulty, it's just a lack of Dark Souls skill.   Thanks to steamworks the multiplayer is a lot [less confusing than GFWL's, ]albeit a little bit slower.Most of the time I can connect to my friends with little to no downtime, but there are those times when it feels like you are in offline mode.   This game has PvP, and it's everywhere. There is a forest where invasions are a regular thing, and there is an arena in the DLC area. Red Sign soapstones are things for honorable physchopathic murderers.  Almost any place you can encounter a boss you can get invaded. PvP is really great in this game because it requires all the knowledge i previously mentioned. If you get invaded, never underestimate your opponet, or you will not survive for long.     People really like the story of this game. I do as well, but it's not just told outright to your face. It's scattered everywhere, from item descriptions to NPC dialouge. Descriptions and NPC dialouge is also a great way to discover the lore about bosses or enemies.   I definitely recommend this game. It's got all the things I love. Great PvE, great PvP, and most of all it allows you to either make new friends or meet hiliariously bad trolls.			"

I definitely recommend this game, so get this game, and prepare to die.Controller is a necessity for this game "

												Dark Souls é um RPG Dungeon Crawler Hardcore de Hack and Slash de uma jobabildade excecional. O design e arte dos inimigos e masmorras bem como o seu combate são as estrelas deste jogo. Que é díficil mas justo, com um ambiente de fantasia medieval profundo, encantador e mortal. Onde a morte nos espera em cada canto mas que mesmo assim nos convece a ficar lá. É um dos melhores jogos do género. Possuí também uma história mistoriosa e complexa mas coerente e muito bem feita (que tem uma ligação forte ás sequelas). E também um modo de Multijogador (Co-Op e PvP) bastante divertidos.Simplesmente um clássico e uma peróloa de jogo.Dark Souls é suberbo, profundo, encantador, perigoso, dícifil, justo, poderoso, glorioso, coerente, inesquecivel, indispensável e épico!

												Dark Souls will always be near and dear to my heart. I've put in nearly 1,000 hours on the 360 version. The PC version has free online so I'm in for that ... you will run into hackers at some point but over all a great game. One of my favorites! If you're planning on picking this up, please have a controller; the port isn't the best but it's still worth playing if you haven't tried this in the past. (Waiting for Dark Souls 2, I hope the port will be better this time around!)			"

												Dark Souls.... doesnt the name just make you cringe?! Well, it shouldn't! People will play games forever, whether it's marbles or Dark souls, but either way, somebody is gonna rage quit! some people will play a video game just to 'Beat' it. However, this game does it a little different.... instead of giving you a choice of beating it or not, it decides for you - and it's never in your favour! This game beats you.... to a pulp.... then runs you over in it's car.... and gets it's mates to help beat the crap out of you.... not even exaggerating a little bit! But why should that scare you off? It's just a game right?Wrong, ♥♥♥♥♥♥!This is more than a game, it's an achievement, an accomplishment, a challenge and a test for all gamers out there!This game is not reccomended for those who are prone to rage quitting, and it's definately not for the faint at heart!'But what's the point if im just going to die all the time?'Shut up, you're adopted! let me tell you what's in store for you!The rewards may be a few souls and a weapon.... but thats in game! Inside your head you have just played the same part of the game about 500 times, and you've died equally. You were about to walk away when you gave it one more shot! finally, you got the SOB down to its last bit of health and you stabbed it right in the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You stood with your head held high when you finally killed that boss and you made it known that you owned it and you had intercourse with it's mother while shouting at the screen. The satisfaction levels are over 9000, and you could even say that you smiled after so much anger and frustration.... and trust me when i say that THAT very smile feels amazing!this game will take you a LONG time to finish..... the first area..... let alone the whole game! but it's not about time, its about how much you want it! it's about your desire to accomplish something! You can say to your weaker friends 'Hey look noob, i finished Dark Souls! what did you do in the last 600 hours of your life?'having said that, this game IS NOT a waste of time at all! if you play for an hour and dont even get to a new bonfire (Checkpoint [Very Rare]) dont decide it's no use, just keep trying.... there are more secrets in this game the illuminati dont even know whats going on!! Look for shortcuts, try new areas dont get caught in a rut!So yeah, thats what i think anyway! please consider playing this game (If you can get it working on steam [Need a games for windows account]) Dark Souls..... You are worthy of nothing less...9.3/10Dylan Burton			"

												I haven't gotten this deep into a game in years. I HIGHLY this game to anyone. It takes a few deaths getting used to, but once you see that's what makes this game great and is how it teaches you, you'll always want to play more.Unfotunately the games main downfall is the lack of time the developers put into finishing this port to PC, so it's VERY IMPORTANT that you install DSfix to resolve the graphical and game issues. You'll be very glad you did. DSfix doesn't affect any capabilities of the game besides improving just about everything and even the delevopers even recomend it. Get it now!			"

												Dark Souls is a very difficult 8/10. The underlying game is genius, truly wonderful that eggs you on to discover what lays around the next corner. The fusion between Fighting game, Adventure, RPG is almost magical. But it is let down by it unforgiving personality. Some of the bosses I beat first time round (so it's not a skill problem), and nearly all of the bosses (up to the Lordvessel) were destroyed within a handful of attempts. However, this game really shouldn't take 50-60 hours to complete! A lot of that is wandering around trying to figure out what to do next, or trying to figure out the game logic. This game would be 10/10 if it was designed so that the same content (main) would take the average user 30 hours at most to complete. The first 30 hours were amazing for me, but it just became a plod and some of the later bosses felt like boring trial and error until something worked. Some of the challenge was not real ""challenge"" either. It was bad level design (even though overall the level design was rather superb), bad bonfire placement, glitchy and unpredictable collision boxes. I wanted to just love this game, and although I do truly see the brilliant glint in Dark Souls eye, it's still a Diamond in the Rough. Sort out all those shoddy hitboxes, clipping and dodgy bonfire placements and lessen up on the bulking up game time via over repetition.Stop allowing AI to hit through stone walls, where my blade fails, but then on the other hand let a dragon be shot slowly to death by an arrow because he hasn't detected you are slowly killing him. it feels cheap because it is.Still I can recommend this game to anyone that loves Dark fantasy, a deep challenge, and very wonderfully created world (even if thin to non existent on plot). But that kind of makes it even more mysterious.			"

												Dark Souls, like Demon's Souls before it, treats the player to hostility not seen in video games since players started expecting to see the end. Dark Souls is not hard, simply fair - it even lets you come back an infinite number of times to try again. Enemies and their location decide the tactics a player should use, infinitely adding to their survivability. The game does not want you to win.When you win however, it accepts defeat.There are no Resident Evil style ""IT SURVIVED #OMG fight it AGAIN"" moments.They even held back the JRPG ""You gotta die"" thing, with one exception. They replaced them with ""You're not going to survive if you don't pay attention"" tests.Atmosphere-wise Dark Souls is a Survival Horror pretending to be a Fantasy RPG. Sure, it's got Fantasy elements, but they're all warped into a world where you, an Undead (marked with the ability to return to life at the last spot he sat down for a bit) are charged with deciphering a unreliably narrated world filled with plot and counter plot, where metaphors are blurred with reality. You're even perpetually attacked by alternate versions of yourself who hunt you for sport.On the negative side, the PC port was put together by taking the Xbox disc, grinding into thin paste and feeding down an ethernet cable. The button promts are still Xbox! PC controls are so badly implemented it's like they only playtested with the 19 fingered Chernobyl Bloodsucker that designed it. Get a controller, it does not matter which kind. You'll need a third party program to use a PS3 controller though.You'll also need ""DSfix"", a program that allows tinkering with many settings, and even helps the game run better. Optional are ""DSMfix"" for diehard mouse and keyboard battlers, and ""DSCfix"", which is fairly crucial to co-op with buddies.Multiplayer is woven into singleplayer with ""Humanity"" which turns your Undead self into a Human form fit to call living. Then people can kick your door down and take your stuff.Co-op is done through White Summon signs. which people leave around the place hoping to be summoned to your world. They will help you until you kill the area's boss.PVP is done through several methods, the basic is Invasion. One player will use an item in their own game, which will allow them to invade your game world in an attempt to kill you. Since all parallel undead are the same person, this guy is an alternate you who wants you-you dead. Fight. Overall Dark Souls is a game that will pretend it hates you until you realise it just wants an equally skilled opponent. It will make that opponent of you, or you will quit the game.Papa Nito loves you all.			"

There are a wide variety of spells, weapons, armors, and techniques at your disposal; and there are unique pros and cons to each. The game also looks great, especially if you are using DSfix.The storyline is pretty fantastic as well. There are several sub-plots as well and they will differ based on your actions.Gameplay is absolutely wonderful. Truly a skill game, there are very few points where you feel like there was nothing you could do, or that you got cheated by the game into dying.			"

												You awaken in a prison cell, hollowed and stripped of all humanity. You are an Undead, a cursed being trapped within the purgatory that is the Undead Asylum. Who you are and what brought you here are a mystery. The curse makes one forget it seems. As you break out of your cell messages written with soapstone start to appear. Slowly you will make your way through the Asylum, heeding the cautionary tales written by those who came before you. You will seek comfort in the warm embrace of the bonfire, an oasis amidst the rubble and death. Before long however, you will be faced with insurmountable odds in the form of the Asylum Demon. This is where you will most likely die. However death isn't the end of things, you're an Undead after all. Soon you'll feel the warm embrace of the bonfire once more. At this point you will try again, again and again. Until at long last you slay the beast and are liberated from this place. This is where Dark Souls starts and your journey begins. That journey will be beautiful and engaging. The world you'll explore, the characters you'll meet are all lovingly crafted and will stick with you until long after. The gameplay is brutally unforgiving and exceptionally rewarding. Every bit of progress you'll make in this game will be a personal victory. It is incredibly captivating, challenging and simply put fun. If you are looking for a lengthy hands off narrative with compelling, tense action orientated D&D style gameplay. Then do yourself a favor, pick this game up and praise the sun!That being said, it is not without it's faults. The port of this game is sloppy to say the least. Natively it runs at sub par resolutions and has it's gamelogic locked at 30fps. This means that out of the box this game is practically unplayable for most PC gamers. Luckily there are ways to fix these glaring issues in the form of DSFix. (V2.4 at the time of this writing) It is a third party injector created for Dark Souls Prepare To Die Edition that enables you to alter render settings at the engine level.All in all I can not recommend Dark Souls enough.Praise the sun!

												Dark Souls is the very definition of a game. It has action, it has stats evolution, it has an intrisic rich lore and universe that's there for those who wish to dwell into the story, but it also has one of the best and most beautiful level designs of all time. It's highly dificult, it's ruthlessly punishing, it's highly rewarding. One of the few games I can't get enough and keep replaying over and over again,  and even doing countless attempts of (utterly failed) speedruns. Possibly the most perfectly structured game of all time. One of my all time favorites.Always remember:1. Be patient.2. Don't get greedy.3. Study your enemies and surroundings.4. Persevere.(PS: ♥♥♥♥ Bed Of Chaos. Just ♥♥♥♥ it.)			"

												This goes high on the list of games that are truly my favorites, and that surprises me because I have yet to defeat the whole game! Endless deaths and trial somehow push me through wanting to collect my souls for a level up and move on through a tough boss battle. The game is very punishing but rewarding in all the right ways, making me come back for more each time. If you like a challenge, are prepared to die many times, and enjoy unique level designs then this is the game for you. I don't just recommend this game but i highly recommend it. I've become addicted to it and I am an overall BAD player. I suck. If I can do it so can you. I can promise that its well worth your time. Practice makes perfect in a game like dark souls. The lore is rediculously interesting and the amount of replayability is high as well. There is a lot to do in this game and every time you move forward you will feel relief and happiness before the despair of realizing the next area you are about to go to seems to be an even bigger trial than before. Its all part of the fun!			"

												Dark Souls is fantastic blah blah blah, I get sick pleasure from pain and am a complete masochist, etc.  If you want a real review, there are plenty of them available.  Rather than a true review, this is a wakthrough on what you need to do to get Dark Souls working on PC.  When From Software ported Dark Souls to PC, they felt it was too easy to get into the game and decided to screw up the graphics and controls so that the player would have to do a quest before they even opened the game (/sarcasm).  The reality is, From Software had no idea what they were doing in regards to PC programming and game design, and only ported the game because there was large fan demand (so don't hold the crap state of the vanilla game against them).  The result was the game can't display HD resolutions and the keyboard and mouse controls are awful.  Fortunately there are some fixes available.  (One more thing: If at all possible, use a gamepad.)First off, after downloading and installing Dark Souls, right click the game in your inventory and click on properties at the bottom.  A box with several tabs will open.  Click on the last tab that says BETAS.  In the tab, there's a scroll down box with something like dspdte-2.0.  Make sure the box displays the dspdte-2.0 line and hit the close button.  You don't need an access code or anything, it just automatically downloads the beta.  What this does is it makes sure your copy of Dark Souls interacts with Steam for online activity instead of GFWL.  It also ensures compatibility with the most recent DSFix (see below).  Note: Supposedly copies purchased and downloaded after Steam integration default to dsptde-2.0 but having never tested it, I don't know if it's true.DSFix is the mod that fixes screen resolution options and rendering and less importantly if you are using a gamepad, key bindings.  DSFix can be downloaded here:  http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fdarksouls%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D19&pUp=1Just follow the instructions in the description.  If you experience crashing or FPS drops, there's a good chance that your copy of Dark Souls and DSFix are not the most recent versions.Before talking about the mouse fix, I really urge you to just use a gamepad.  The controls are pretty complex as far as keyboards go and it's a bit difficult to press several buttons at a time on the keyboard, something that will happen often in Dark Souls.  The game was designed for controllers and it really shows, especially in button combos.  If you are using a gamepad, congrats!  You can go die now!  By which I mean play Dark Souls.If I somehow failed to convince you to use a gamepad, then you need to get DSMFix, the Dark Souls mouse fix.  It is built to work with DSFix and can be found here:  http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/28/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fdarksouls%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D28&pUp=1Disclaimer:  I have not tested this mod out having never used keyboard and mouse controls, but I hear good things about  it and it probably can't make mouse controls any worse than they are.So yeah that's how you make Dark Souls playable on PC.  With any luck this will get upvoted enough to be displayed on the Steam store page.  The pain of setting it up is absolutely worth it.  The game is definitely one of the most well designed RPGs ever made.			"

A box with several tabs will open.  Click on the last tab that says BETAS.  In the tab, there's a scroll down box with something like dspdte-2.0.  Make sure the box displays the dspdte-2.0 line and hit the close button.  You don't need an access code or anything, it just automatically downloads the beta.  What this does is it makes sure your copy of Dark Souls interacts with Steam for online activity instead of GFWL.  It also ensures compatibility with the most recent DSFix (see below).  Note: Supposedly copies purchased and downloaded after Steam integration default to dsptde-2.0 but having never tested it, I don't know if it's true.DSFix is the mod that fixes screen resolution options and rendering and less importantly if you are using a gamepad, key bindings.  DSFix can be downloaded here:  http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fdarksouls%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D19&pUp=1Just follow the instructions in the description.  If you experience crashing or FPS drops, there's a good chance that your copy of Dark Souls and DSFix are not the most recent versions.Before talking about the mouse fix, I really urge you to just use a gamepad.  The controls are pretty complex as far as keyboards go and it's a bit difficult to press several buttons at a time on the keyboard, something that will happen often in Dark Souls.  The game was designed for controllers and it really shows, especially in button combos.  If you are using a gamepad, congrats!  You can go die now!  By which I mean play Dark Souls.If I somehow failed to convince you to use a gamepad, then you need to get DSMFix, the Dark Souls mouse fix.  It is built to work with DSFix and can be found here:  http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/28/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fdarksouls%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D28&pUp=1Disclaimer:  I have not tested this mod out having never used keyboard and mouse controls, but I hear good things about  it and it probably can't make mouse controls any worse than they are.So yeah that's how you make Dark Souls playable on PC.  With any luck this will get upvoted enough to be displayed on the Steam store page.  The pain of setting it up is absolutely worth it.  The game is definitely one of the most well designed RPGs ever made.			"

												This is one of the most agonizing and painful experiences of my life. Playing this game has made me Infuriated, Depressed, and soul-less. All in one sitting. I love every second of it! For how painful an experience this game is, its also one of the most rewarding I've had to date. You bad at video games? I don't recommend playing this!This is a game for those of us who are looking for a challenge, and are okay with losing a lot, if it means we get better at the game, and soon become able to deal with any situation. Its like a Roguelike with JRPG roots. Play if you dare!With dark souls 2 right around the corner, this game is a must play.			"

												This goes high on the list of games that are truly my favorites, and that surprises me because I have yet to defeat the whole game! Endless deaths and trial somehow push me through wanting to collect my souls for a level up and move on through a tough boss battle. The game is very punishing but rewarding in all the right ways, making me come back for more each time. If you like a challenge, are prepared to die many times, and enjoy unique level designs then this is the game for you. I don't just recommend this game but i highly recommend it. I've become addicted to it and I am an overall BAD player. I suck. If I can do it so can you. I can promise that its well worth your time. Practice makes perfect in a game like dark souls. The lore is rediculously interesting and the amount of replayability is high as well. There is a lot to do in this game and every time you move forward you will feel relief and happiness before the despair of realizing the next area you are about to go to seems to be an even bigger trial than before. Its all part of the fun!			"

												Dark Souls is the very definition of a game. It has action, it has stats evolution, it has an intrisic rich lore and universe that's there for those who wish to dwell into the story, but it also has one of the best and most beautiful level designs of all time. It's highly dificult, it's ruthlessly punishing, it's highly rewarding. One of the few games I can't get enough and keep replaying over and over again,  and even doing countless attempts of (utterly failed) speedruns. Possibly the most perfectly structured game of all time. One of my all time favorites.Always remember:1. Be patient.2. Don't get greedy.3. Study your enemies and surroundings.4. Persevere.(PS: ♥♥♥♥ Bed Of Chaos. Just ♥♥♥♥ it.)			"

												This is a game that any gamer should atleast try. It brings a unique approach to difficulty in modern gaming. The best way I can describe the game is that it will break you down and rebuild you as a player. It has no room for those who wish to be catered to for it has no map and gives very little hints in terms of where you need to go or what you have to do for encounters so YOU HAVE TO THINK which is always good for you. : )			"

												Dark Souls is a game that is very similar to an abusive relationship. You get hurt over and over and you just keep coming back for more. It doesn't stop until it is done with you and that is why it shines. The amount of satisfaction that flowed over me as I brutally destroyed a particular pair of bosses with my Zweihander is something that I honestly haven't gotten from a game in a very long while. Buckle up and prepare to be stomped on, impaled, burnt, and poisoned. Praise the Sun!			"

After much more attempts, you'll eventually win this game pretty easy and every other dark souls game should feel like a piece of cake. After that even in your normal life you will never rage again and conquer the patience of a yoga master.You will feel peaceful to your surroundings and never tilt again.Conclusion: You 'll either end up being friendly to others or feeling like you wanna kill everything.Should you buy it?: HELL YES ITS THE BEST ONE OF THE WHOLE SERIES			"

												I told myself I would write a review once I was done with Dark Souls. And so here it is.Dark Souls. I am late to the Souls party, since it is 2015 and this game came out... what? 4 years ago? It's an action RPG with a story hidden behind dialogue and item descriptions where you can die numerous times and come back at a nice bonfire. The RPG part mostly comes from increasing your skills and joining a covenant. The game does not really provide you much options to be a character, but that didn't stop me from being Knight Benedict of Astora, Blessed by the First-Born. Most dialogue is also just ""Yes or No, mutafugger"".The game's popularity comes from being ""hard"" or ""difficult"" with many of the fans of the game telling newcomers who are having trouble ""Git Gud"". I had to hear that myself as I was starting out and when I died a pathetic number of times to certain bosses (Here's to you, Knight Artorias), but would I say the game is hard? No. I don't believe this game is hard. I believe this game is frustrating, with a lot of mechanics that I question each time I encounter them. Questions like ""Why can this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sancutary Guardian hit me 4 times in a row and keep my stunlocked and oh god damn it no, not the lightning again"" as well as ""Wait, these ghosts in New Londo can phase through walls and floors, because they're ghosts, but I can't roll away from them? How does that make- Oh no, now I'm surrounded and they're looking at my butt.""Perhaps the only difficult part in this game comes from the early game, when bosses like the Asylum Demon and Taurus Demon can be plunged attacked but (for Asylum) you can only plunge once or (for Taurus) you can plunge multiple times, but its a fight to climb up the ladder without him killing you. Then you realize that the ""git gud"" part comes from running into a specific part of the boss and just wailing on them because they can't hit you there (under Sif's legs, or against Seath's crotch and tentacle leg, for example). So the game is not hard. It's very frustrating, especially when you first start out, and when you encounter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like the ghosts that you cannot roll through, despite them being GHOSTS.The lore in this game, however, is very good. It's not all up in your face like certain games, and you got to dig to find your answers to certain questions, though only some will be answered (Who was Gwyn's Firstborn? Was it Solaire? Was it Andre of Astora?). I'm always a fan of world building, and FROM did some great world building with this game. Not much to say beyond that. It's good. It's really damn good.The online community is small, but that's to be expected. Dark Souls 2 is out, Bloodborne is coming, and the community is split between the GFWL players and the Steam beta players. There was also the Region Lock that was only killed a few days ago. The game, for me, got -much- better once I was getting randomly invaded. Was fun. Managed to kill me a Spirit of Vengeance and Dark Phantom back-to-back before I got my final achievements today. Made me feel like I was gud, unlike the bosses, which just made me feel like I was cheesing all of them. Like the Ceaseless Discharge. He is so easy to cheese.So the game is good? Yeah, it's good. The combat is decent enough, though you should learn to parry, even though all but one boss cannot be parried. The lore is good. The online is still there, even if they can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (thanks to the two guys who left messages on top of the summon sign for the Manus fight). Is it hard? No. It is not a hard game, it is only a frustrating one, and there is a HUGE difference.Buy it if it's on sale, though I suspect I'm probably the last person in the world who got this game, and I didn't even buy it for myself. Thank you, my friends.			"

												You have to learn the moveset of every boss in order to beat him - let's take knight Artorias for example - the boss fight is so good you have to experience it to know what I am talking about. You will die maybe 4-5 times and then you start changing your tactic. After you learn every move the knight Artorias has, you can kill him if you are careful. It took me over 18 tries. I died 18 times trying to kill him, and I was HAPPY about it. The feeling of dopamine and endorphine flooding your brain after you finally beat the boss is the greatest feeling I ever had in gaming.I wish I could erase my memory of playing this game, forget absolutely everything about it (beacuse at this point I probably know almost everything, even that the Ingward returns to Firelink Shrine after you talk to him after beating Four Kings, I found this information after 3 years of the game being out) and play the game all over again. The Best game I have ever played, I have the sweetest memories about the time I first played Dark Souls.I love Dark Souls. So should you, if you give it a chance.			"

Review in one sentenceA very fun and challenging game, a one of its kind and a must-try.Gaming BackgroundI'm a PC gamer who predominantly plays FPS games, but has played a bit of MOBA and RTS too. Before I picked up Dark Souls, the only games I had ever played with a controller date back to the 6th generation consoles. I decided to give Dark Souls a go seeing as I finally got myself a controller and my friends were insisting I did.Index of this review Difficulty is Fun  Lore & Level Design A port of a console game Unnecessarily secretive Final wordsDifficulty is FunThough this game is notorious for its difficulty, it's challenging in a fair way; there isn't any RNG that determines whether you live or die. This game is hard because it's skill based.In a lot of RPGs, your character becomes stronger through leveling. Often this means you can both dish out and sustain orders of magnitude more damage than before. In Dark Souls, while you can definitely level your character to some extent, the real difference between you at level 1 and you at level 80 is raw skill. That's what makes this game so uniquely fun. You overcome the opponents not because your stats say you do; you overcome them because you've died to them a couple times and you now understand what you've been doing wrong all this time. This is where the phrase ""git gud"" comes from. Proof of this is that some players have been able to beat the game with a lvl 1 character, or without healing a single time.The always-on autosave feature in this game means that mistakes are permanent. Although this sounds hardcore, it's important to understand that dying is an important part of the game, and you lose less on death than in most games. Your ""souls"", which is both the in-game currency and the unit of XP you can use to level up and upgrade weapons, are dropped on the spot where you died.Lore & Level DesignDark Souls is made by FROM software, a Korean game developer, and it shows. The lore is akin to Asian folklore rather than the Greek, Norse, or Biblical stuff we're used too. This makes the lore unique and refreshing. Personally, the lore hasn't been able to rub off on me that much. It's hard to understand and hasn't really succeeded in giving me a sense of purpose, or part of something huge.That said, there's something uniquely captivating about Dark Souls. Its level design deserves an honorable mention, because it has somehow succeeded making 90% of the game contingent on each other. This means you can walk from the starting area to the rest of the world without loading screens or cutscenes. But it doesn't stop there; they have managed to meticulously interconnected their world in a brilliant way. Time and time again you will find yourself bewildered, exclaiming: ""This elevator leads back here!? Holy crap!""In another stroke of genius, they decided to leave music out of the game almost entirely. They mean to make the atmosphere feel solitary and desolate, which they've done a pretty decent job at. On top of all this, it looks pretty decent for a 2011 game.A port of a console gameIn this part I'll be talking about some technical downsides that I feel stem mostly from the fact that this game is a PC Port from a 2011 console game. By default the framerate is capped at 30fps. Popular community made mods allow you to bump this up to 60, but at certain costs. This is the type of game engine where the graphical framerate is linked to the game's calculations. This means that the game will behave slightly differently at 60fps, yuck.The online connectivity is can be finnicky and might require community mods to work to your liking as well. It's not the most stable or reliably built game in the world, basically.Unnecessarily secretiveMy biggest gripe with this game is how it doesn't bother explaining new players a lot of their complicated mechanics. Don't get me wrong! The fact that this came doesn't spam you with popups saying ""Press R2 to parry!"" is mostly a good thing. The game's minimalistic HUD and GUI contribute to its unique atmosphere, but this is a double-edged blade.It takes most players a good while to figure out what Humanity is, how it works, what the number in your top bar means and what it means to be hollowed. To tell you the truth I still only understand how it works, but not why it works. I could go on and on listing bits of information or entire game mechanics that remain poorly-, mis-, or even unexplained throughout the game. This would all be fine in 1999, where the kid next door would tell you how to unlock a cool sword. But alas, we're in the era where extensive libraries of this type of information is at your fingertips. Sadly, at times this game almost beckons you to whip up the wiki, because decisions are permanent and you might not want to make any mistakes.The best way to play this game is by having an enthousiastic friend you can approach for specific questions, but will not tell you all of the ins and outs of the game.Summary and Final Words- Very enjoyable and rewarding gameplay- Looks decent, with great character & level design- Unique and myserious, sometimes to a faultNo matter what kind of player you are, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not at least trying this game. If you have any comments, questions, or critiques, feel free to add me on Steam. I'll even help you with the game if you want.			"

												This game is one of my favorite games and does many things extremely well, but does suffer from some flaws that will cause many people to miss out on experiencing the game.My criticism is that the PC port of this game is awful and you must resort to outside fixes to make the game playable. The DSFix mod and the recent switch from GFWL to Steam for the online component of the game both allow you to play the game, but shouldn't be necessary in the first place. There are also some glaring flaws in the game design that are an added annoyance in the already frustrating game (looking at you Bed of Chaos).Now for everything that I love about Dark Souls. The amount of work that FromSoft put into the level design is astounding. Everything just seems to flow perfectly, your eyes are drawn to (or away from) things that you are supposed to find. Unlocking a shortcut or finding a new path can sometimes stop you in your tracks and blow your mind. The characters, the lighting, and the scenery all come together to immerse you in the world, every playthrough I find myself pausing from time to time to just stop and gaze at everything around me. You get the sense that you’re a part of something so much bigger than yourself (literally in a lot of ways). The lore is deep and rich, but you only scratch the surface in game, everything else is mystery or up to your interpretation. The frustration and feeling of accomplishment that follows. Getting stuck in an area and subsequently beating it is so satisfying.I can only recommend Dark Souls to someone that is not only willing to face the difficulty of playing the game, but also the difficulty of making the game playable.Good luck to all the Chosen Undead out there!Praise the Sun!   \[T]/			"

												I am pretty sure you're gonna be able to find a reasonable enough review above me, yet there is an important thing that is not being mentioned often enough. This is NOT a difficult game. It's not about dying all the time and not about raging all around. It is a marketing trick that worked for some reason, but you should not fall for it. Keep it in mind.Just like some of you, my sweet audience, I skipped this game when it came out. It was a weird idea for me to buy the game just because it's difficult. The one and only reason you'll be forcing this hardcore part is because the rest of them are not worth it. Right? Nah. Marketing team failed. It's not about deaths, not at all. It is the most fair game I've ever played. As long as you're paying respect to it, not trying to rush the whole location or avoid those fights in any way, you'll be going through this dark world as a hot knife through the butter.You'll die, of course, a  couple of times, but you'll know perfectly what happened. You'll adjust your strategy and try again. It's never about location being bad or monsters being strong. It's always about you making silly mistakes due to your arrogance or ignorance.  This is a thing that is capable of bringing back your thirst for gaming if you've lost it as I did. It is an absolute masterpiece in terms of making something complex with a very basic parts. It is something you definetly should try if you're fond of gaming. It doesn't even matter if you're filthy casual. Eventually you'll git gud.			"

												This game is not beginner friendly and most new players are going to hit a brick wall for a few hours. But, once you start to get a grip on the game, it's very rewarding. It's an amazingly deep and complex RPG that rewards exploraration and skill. I actaully tried this game many months ago and had really bad first impressions because of the difficulty. But, I decided I really wanted to experience this game, so I picked it up again. One thing to note is this a really bad PC port, but at least it doesn't have GFWL anymore. Now, you can unlock the framerate without getting kicked off of GFWL. I highly recommend getting at least DSFix. Lastly, please use a controller for this game. If you're not going to use a controller, you're better off not playing it all to be honest.			"

												It's not the most graphically pleasing, not the most optimized, not the best UI, not the smoothest combat feel, but it is the best Dark Souls game.The level/world design, enemy design and story/atmosphere are all top tier. The game mechanics can feel slow and clunky, but they are the most fair and balanced of the souls games.After 300+ hours with friends and alone, on new characters and in the highest levels of NG+, this is still one of my favorite games.Since they've removed the windows live stuff from this game, it's gotten a lot better. Install DSFix from the Nexus for all of your graphics/bugs/FPS problems. Use DSCM from the Nexus to connect and coordinate with friends and you'll have no problems doing full co-op runs or friendly duels.			"

												Would you even survive the Tutorial?Yes, we all know that the main thing of Dark Souls it's the difficulty, with actually a lot of game mechanics to understand and test. It will make you try a lot and it's actually not that easy for beginners. It can be quite frustrating sometimes if you are not in the right mood, as it can offer some big challenges in certain areas or bosses.The Dark Souls world is huge and quite open, will take some time to get oriented and follow the story at first. But once you get the hands on it I assure this game will give you a different experience than any other games out there.On the technical aspects you should install DSFix and use a controller to play this game smoothly, if you don't have a controller then I recommend DSMF(Dark Souls Mouse Fix) to get better and smooth mouse inputs. Forget about graphics options too, the game lacks of any important one, that's when DSFix come to save us, it offer some internal resolution and graphicals tweaks to optimize the game visually or performance-wise. I believe they had to rush the PC port due to a lot of people requests to bring it to PC. But please don't throw away this game because of that, it will take a few minutes to install those plugins.So to conclude, I would say that even if you are not a fan of medieval games like I was and as I mentioned early, this game will give you a different experience from any other game, I would say that it can even change your mind about what you see from videogames nowadays. It will actually make you live the feeling of progressionist and completionism.Totally recommended!			"

												The level design is just about one of the best from recent years. RPG-elements are minimal and the fighting, atleast as a warrior, was pretty boring. Dodge/block slash was the way to beat the game. The game has been said to be hard, but as a bad player I didn't find it that hard. Most bosses I beat with 1-3 tries(two of the lordvessel bosses fell in first try, final boss in three). Towards the end, bosses became easier and easier as the charachter got better gear. Only the ""dark"" areas gave me a lot of trouble, but they were surprisingly few for an fantasy-rpg. Comparing these to a generic MMORPG bosses, I found that these were a bit too easy to learn and bit too generic to actually make the learning part essential.The game had some frustrating parts, but I fast realised that they were frustrating because I wasn't supposed to be there yet difficulty-wise, again another nod to the level design. When approached later, those areas became pretty easy too.The game has some flaws, mostly dealing with shoddy PC-convert(fixed with mods). Also the in the game I think there was too much running through areas already ventured, better fast travel system could've been implemented earlier in the game and allow much less boring grinding.Also I didn't much appreciate the fact that the flames were always after the boss, not before. So taking 3 tries, meant that one must also beat all the minions between boss fight and the flame which usually was more of a nuisance than an actual challenge.The game gives too little information which is a quite normal for a RPG. I wonder what is the major problem actually explaining game mechanics in game instead of having to find out about the with either trial-and-error, manual or using a wikipage.Nonetheless, the game felt like a breath of fresh air that got just a bit too stale in the end. The ""difficulty"" theme didn't quite carry to the end and rest of the atmosphere was therefore lost. I still highly recommend everyone atleast try the first 10-20 hours, as one starts to respect level design in a whole new level(badum tsh).			"

												Don't get fooled by my playtime... I used to play this off steam way back when, shortly after it came out, and just now got it on Steam to have it in my collection there... playing DSIII now.This is the game that began the legendary DS-franchise. Yes, there were other games by the same company before that which were like the ancestors (Demon's Soul for example), yet this one, I think, was what got people in the West into these games.You can tell from the graphics that this is a couple of years old, but most likely, you'll soon download the popular mod that improves graphics anyway. I can't tell you whether you should start with this one and go to DSII and III from there... some people think it's important, others say you can start with any of them. What I can say is: It still can be quite challenging. Compared to DSIII, it's a bit slower-paced (the actual combat), as DSIII adds some elements of the popular Bloodbourne, so combat is faster. Still, it IS challenging, and if you're new to the franchise, you will die. A lot. But, here is the deal: That's part of the game, of the philosophy behind it. It's not like in other games, where dieing is rather uncommon or a really big deal once it happens. Dieing in DS is part of learning the game, of learning the controls, mechanics and fighting style of each boss and trash mob. Once you digest and accept that idea, you hopefully will stay calm once it happens. If you really really get ticked off when you die, yyou might wanna stay clear of this. However, for all the frustration and ""pain"" you endure, there is a big payoff - mastering the game, beating the bosses feels so very satisfying, is so rewarding. Other games afterwards might feel sluggish and too easy.Also, there IS lore in this game. Yet, it is not shoved into your face with big arrows and question marks and markers. You have to explore, take your time to look around, read item descriptions etc. Even then, things will be...dubious, but I find this mystery and the fact it's not ""read to you in a loud voice through a PA system"" quite fascinating.PLEASE take your time. Accept dieing as a big part of the learning curve. Practice with the controls. Try strategies. Don't spoil yourself too much with guides and walkthroughs. Dive in, explore, learn, and enjoy.I can't tell you whether this is the BEST DS game to get into the series as the graphics are a bit outdated, but it's a damn good starting point, so check it out, it's still a challenging, rewarding and exciting game!

												The Dark Souls series is famous for its gloomy atmosphere, the creative, sometimes grotesque, but always impressive art style and its very intense combat system. The player has to concentrate constantly, as almost every mistake might be punishable by death. In comparison to Dark Souls II, Dark Souls is a bit more welcoming to beginners because deaths do not cause the maximum health to decrease here (""hollowing""), so that the same nasty boss can be taken on without that additional disadvantage. For me, this was a frustrating turn-off in DS2, and I enjoy DS1 more. Also, unlimited enemy respawns in DS1 make farming and upgrading easier than in DS2, a significant factor for starters who prefer a lower difficulty.However, it is still crucial to study the game in order to advance. You need to know how stronger enemies and bosses can be beaten, either by your own observation or by watching tutorials. And you have to optimize your stats, at least as a new player, in order to gain some wiggle room for the inevitable mistakes. Basically, by optimizing your stats, you determine the difficulty of your game: Running around naked with a dagger and without levelling up is one of the highest ""difficulty settings"". If you want to have an easier first run, you watch tutorials and read wikis in order to - find the best locations to farm souls (= xp points and currency) in repeated killing sprees and subsequent zone resets (=enemy respawns) at a Bonfire- understand how the basic stats determine secondary stats (e.g. strength and physical damage, or encumbrance and roll speed) - get tips how to upgrade both your character and your weapons and armour- learn where to find or buy pieces of equipment that suit your playstyle and match each other.One example for matching equipment at the beginning of the game would be: - Zweihänder, a heavy and slow weapon that deals high damage and gives you a good chance to stagger enemies, but consumes a lot of stamina with each attack- Grass Crest Shield, a special item that boosts your stamina regeneration even when worn on your back, while two-handing your weapon- Elite Knight Armour, which is relatively heavy, but gives good defence values and poise, enabling you to take hits from quicker enemies while you build up your slow two-handed attack without being staggered or killed- Havel's Ring, a magical ring that increases your load capacity, meaning that you can still run and dodge roll relatively fast despite of heavy equipmentThis example should give you an idea how complex building a character can be, as there are so many interacting factors to consider.Due to the number of equippable items and viable strategies, all the DS games invite players to try out different combinations and find out what suits their taste most - not only regarding tactics and weapon movement sets that ""feel good"", but also the looks of your hero (the internet created the term ""Fashion Souls"" for a reason). I am quite fascinated by this game and give it a 9/10.			"

												Truly one of the best Action Role-Playing Games of all time.From Software combined realism and RPG elements for one of the most unique and satisfying combat systems ever created. Enemies and bosses alike based around this combat system creates the most fun I've ever had killing anything in any game EVER.Pros: Well designed enemies, weapons, bosses, armor, you name it. The world is immersive, the gameplay fun and challenging, the characters believable, and the lore interesting. Fun enough to outweigh all the cons.Cons: Bugs, faulty physics, anything below Lower Undead Burg, Duke's Archives, difficulty spikes, hackers, Windows Live, and some enemies (Bonewheels, Torch Hollows, etc.) feel cheap, the mouse controls are absolutely horrific (thank god you can use an Xbox controller, with one the controls are great and responsive).Overall, the good parts of the game completely outweigh the bad. Sometimes you just need to consider the cons a necessary challenge so you don't smash your controller. I give Dark Souls an 87/100. To put things into perspective, this is my favorite game of all time.			"

												You'll enjoy killing and dying thousand times. But you must be warned about the many bugs of the PC port. If you are aware yet and still wanna play it (tough guy, arent you?), just remember to install the patches (if really needed) to improve your gameplay. I dont want you to rage (more than you need) in this game. The armors and enemies are awesome. My favorite character is Artorias (hipsters calling it mainstream in 3... 2...). The story is awesome and you have a awesome role in the game. You can change your fate and do whatever you want as you get more experienced in battle. Remember: Even if you turn into the best warrior in the world, you'll need to die someday (Irl too but it doesnt matter right now, right?)... Prepare to some AWKWARD deaths.			"

												Praise the Sun. Honestly if you dont praise you will just die. all the time. dont buy this game. its so much fun tho, so just buy it. But you are going to immediately regret that decision. until you beat the first boss. then you love it, until you face a REAL boss. This game will rip your heart out over and over again and just when you think you've had enough, you beat a boss and lie to yourself by saying you love it. if i had 100 bucks i would buy this game like 4 more times and immediately reget it. but it will be the best 100 bucks ive spent on a game ever. 0/10 best RPG ive ever played. period.In all seriousness, who would have ever thought a game whose (EXPLICIT) plotline is basically just ""trying to ring 2 bells"" would be one of my favorite games of all time. 10/10			"

												Let's see.. are you the kind of gamer who's into... Looking for a very challenging but fair game? Something that allows you to play any class or style you want to? A game in which has amazing lore that isn't upfront about it? An experience that will leave you unable to play games like Skyrim ever again? NPCs and characters that will impact you even after you have turned off the game? Jolly co-operation? Holds a DLC that is without a doubt mind blowingly fantastic? Serves you with replay value up to several runs or completely new runs?If any of these clicked with yah, than may I introduce you to Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition as the best candidate for the job. Seriously a masterpiece of a game that at first glance... seems like a hard game. You'll probably die often which will rustle your pants, but when you really pay attention and look into the lore... my god, it's REALLY deep. Apart from games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age, along with Elder Scrolls series- this game holds a record for most hidden lore in gaming history.Mechanics are so well done, that I can't enjoy games like Skyrim anymore without thinking back to how well Dark Souls plays out with the fighting, the classes, how weapons function, ect. I must admit, the co-op needs better support for the servers lack good connection plus how the leveling system works with co-op is flawed. Apart from that, I sincerely pray everyone gives this game a chance. It's one of my top 10 favorite games of all time!			"

												If there's a modern video-game series that can be considered ""Balls-to-the-wall hard"" or ""Nintendo hard""(NES era, mind you), then most people will think of Dark Souls. That being said, after you've finished this game, you'll probably be thinking that The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is for pre pubescent girls. But let me get a little more in-depth on why you should (or shouldn't):Gameplay 8/10: A few MMO/RPG elements are involved in Dark Souls; mainly with stat allocation that includes upgrading strength, dexterity, endurance, etc. with the immensely versatile souls. However, there's quite a few factors that make Dark Souls vastly different than a standard third person hack and slash fantasy. The souls work as both a source of experience points and currency, as well as magic that oddly enough does not rely on the use of mana but rather a predetermined quality that can be used between safe points (Bonfires) are good example that there's a lot of fantasy elements that are changed to the point where Dark Souls can be its own unique thing.Covenants are also a rather unique factor in Dark Souls, as they are the only source of direct online interaction. Like weapons or attributes, covenants can also determine depending solely on your play-style. Do you like PvP and being an evil butt? Try the elusive Darkwraiths. Prefer to have jolly cooperation? Try out the Warrior of Sunlight. Or maybe you just want more honourable duels? Consider Path of the Dragon. All of these alliances play major roles within the PvP/Co-Op scene, and allows for further character customization.There are a couple of flaws with gameplay though, the main issue being the port from Console to Personal Computer systems. Though a lot of bugs with online play and other PC issues have been fixed, the usage of keyboard+mouse is almost always surpassed by using a controller due to the poor controls, making it feel like Dark Souls was never intended to be a PC game. If you have a controller (Playstation brand can work but Xbox is much more suitable), then this issue won't be a huge problem for you.Graphics 7/10: Nothing's really changed significantly between the ports, so Dark Souls loses points for that, along with the lack of mouth movement when people talk, and that Xbox controls are still used within the game (ie. press ""B"" to evade, when it's space on the Keyboard or triangle on Playstation controllers). All these little factors urk me to no end, but I'm not all negative about the graphics (I gave it a 7 after all).On the flip side, the designs of a majority of the creatures and armors are very creative compared to quite a bit of fantasy titles, yet still adds a couple of very cliché monsters (namely: rats and skeletons) to change it up. PC specs are not super demanding, so a lot of people can play Dark Souls without much lag or FPS drops. Some NPC designs are outright deceiving (Petrus of Thorolund is a great example) and it may surprise some players that silly looking characters may be very useful.. Or possibly the opposite~Difficulty 8/10: Ah yes, the most controversial topic. I'm not going to judge this on glitches/exploits or faulty controls, just full on, pure difficulty within the game. You essentially begin the first 5 minutes fighting a 30 foot demon with a broken, rusted half of a sword. That alone should set in what the game has in store for you. Dark Souls' difficulty is fairly consitant and does gradually get more hard up until the halfway point. A lot of bosses initially seem difficult, but when you know of a strategy against them, they become a lot more tolerable with your newly found MLG strats.But then, you'll come across the infamous duo, Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smaugh. Arguably the most difficult bosses in the game, these two will be the deciding factor on whether or not you can win Dark Souls or completely give up. So why mention these behemoths of boss battles? After this point, the difficulty fluctuates, but never really gets harder than this point. This is a fairly severe flaw in my opinion because of how early on this occurs, and these two should appear much later-- even second-to-last bosses of the game. After you deal with them, you can probably just take on any boss/enemy from that point on, which can be a little grating.Story 8/10: It's vague. Not as vague as say, Five Nights at Freddy's, but it's up there. This does the whole ""Chosen One"" cliché but with a little more finesse; as a majority of people in the game are simply unaware of it and you simply have no idea who to trust and who not to. This can create a sort of isolated feeling, which is very strange when it is your generic ""Chosen One"" story. People'll either treat you like dirt or as a simple friend, but nothing really outside of that with the exception of deities and alike who are aware. There's also a nice mix of personalities: You've got the Crestfallen Warrior and Merchant who's shady and pessimistic respectively, but characters like Solaire of Astoria or Siegmeyer of Catarina are a few who are jolly, humble and optimistic about their undeath makes you want to keep going or like them a lot more than most. A blend of characters, although limited, is well done in this title.Overall: I can ramble on about this game for hours upon hours, but I'll leave it as that. Dark Souls is one of those games that is truly unexpecting. You think you're going through a game that is just meant to tear your butt a new one, but has some hidden strategies, fairly good characters and story. If you want a challenge and have that special little high of accomplishing a difficult level or killing off a hard boss, this is the game for you.If you're susceptible to rage, short-patience, or hit things and hope for the best, you might want to stick with Skyrim.

Though this is a great game, it still has flaws like any other game. Here is my review:Pros:-Beautiful World and Atmosphere-Unforgiving and Challenging-Extremely Rewarding-Cryptic Story and Philosophy-PvP-Combat is well crafted -Exploration is worthwhileCons:-FPS Lock (Can be fixed with DsFix however)-Toxic Snipers (Blighttown in general)-Sometimes boss AOE's feel really cheap (Ceaseless Discharge)-Camera controls can sometimes lead to a cheap deathOverall this game is a great expreience with only minor flaws that can be fixed or controlled.

												This is hands down one of the absolute best games I have ever played. Don't let my 36 hours on the PC version fool you,I spent hundreds of countless hours on this on the PS3 originally and beat the game, but when I saw how good of a deal it was for the Prepare to Die Edition (Which includes all of the DLC and is actually cheaper than the PS3 DLC purchased alone) I couldn't resist.The combat system in this game is so spectacular that when you go back to play a more ""traditional"" rpg like Skyrim or Guild Wars 2, you almost can't enjoy yourself due to the mundane combat systems. The fluid game mechanics include great timing with stabs, slashes, blocks, and parries. Moreover, there is a great dodging system where you can perform critical hits with backstabs.  Yes, it is difficult at first, but that's an essential part of the game, the learning curve, and the sense of reward that you get once you finally beat that boss, or finally succeed in that PVP encounter. This brings me to my favorite part of the game, the multiplayer aspects. The online connectivity in this game is one of the most integrated systems that I've ever seen. Players can summon each other for help in spectacular coop play, or fight to death in exhilarating PVP battles. Moreover, they can post signs and messages to warn (or trick) other players about obstacles ahead, and bloodstains can be left so future players can see where their peers died. It is a blast to play this game online, as there are always new challenges with PVP. Additionally, there is a large replayability factor in this game, because when you beat the game, you can move onto New Game + and further, where bosses and enemies are harder and new challenges arise.I know that many people give up at first because of it's initial difficulty, but after you play for a couple of hours and get accustomed to the combat mechanics, it will be the most rewarding game you have ever played. I would recommend this game to anyone, 10/10.NOTE: Some people complain that PTD is a bad PC port, and I can see where they are coming from. However, if you use a great and simple-to-use program called DSfix, you can configure your graphics and tune them to your liking. If you have a high end PC, you will find that you actually achieve smoother gameplay and framerates than in the consoles with proper configuration. I personally have a low end PC, and have managed to play the game on very playable framerates. All of the small issues that people report are solvable, so don't let that prevent you from buying this great game.			"

You can progress through the game, have fun killing everything and moving on after you're done or get bored of it, but if you really get into it, try to comprehend what the authors are trying to tell you, you'll realise that Dark Souls is a lot more than just a game.The Bad The PC port is pretty bad. There's a framerate restriction and some other annoyances, the developers were even too lazy to remove console tags for controls that pop up everywhere in the game, Luckily, there are mods to fix this, most important one being DSFix, by Durante. There's also a common misconception that a controller is required to play this game, but seeing that I beat DS1 and DS2 with keyboard and mouse, I have to say that's simply not true. In addition to DSFix, you get DS Mouse Fix (requires DSFix), set it up and you're good to go. Adding to the previous point, the controls are pretty bad. It's something you get used to, but it gets quite annoying when you have to press ""Light attack"" and ""Move forward"" at the exact same moment, if you want to do a kick. Again, this is something you can get around in various ways, but there's still no option to simply have this function (aswell as some others, requiring similar actions) bound to a single button. Additionally, binding anything to numbers requires manually editing the key bindings configuration file and there's many keys you can't even bind anything to. There's quite a lot of ""you have to reload the game for this to work"" moments. You have to exit and reload the game every time you want to trade an item to Snuggly the Crow, you have to exit and reload the game every time a Crystal Lizard doesn't spawn where it's supposed to, but more importantly (annoyingly) - you can actually avoid certain deaths in boss fights if you simply exit the game during the fight. There's no way to re-spec your character after allocating stat points (which happens when you level up). This is probably the single most annoying thing on this list, as fulfilling stat requirements and hitting certain breakpoints is what makes or breaks a character build. I cannot stress how crucial this is in the game. If you make a mistake early on in your stat allocation, which you inevitably will, you'll be stuck with it unless you start a new character from scratch. There are several boss fights which are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, One of them is unfairly difficult, unless you bug it out and trivialise it (like 95% of people do, whereas the other 5% post threads on forums complaining that bugging the encounter out does not work for them) and the other has some basic platforming in it. That jump, that one jump almost makes the game fall apart completely. Some quests require that you have read several different Wikis / watched videos on Youtube on how to complete them, as there is literally no way you'll get them done if you rely on the game to work as intended. In fact, you most likely won't have fun getting through the game for the first time if you don't read Wikis or watch videos, or both.Closing ThoughtsIf you haven't played this game, you're really missing out. There is the hassle of getting it to work as it should, with setting up mods, dealing with the controls and whatnot, but if you're tired of formulaic games that spoonfeed you the same watered-down experience in different packages and want to get into some real action and ruin other people's lives (and yours), this is definitely the game for you. Prepare to die.			"

***Spoiler-Free Review***Dark Souls is by far, the most immersive, addictive, and well-rounded RPG I have played in many years. I recommend true RPG afficionados to play it. That being said here is a brief run-down of the most common quesions I have received from early adopters:-The Difficulty - While it is a game that is willing to punish the player, it does not do so unfairly. If you are the kind of player who expects to run headlong into an ambush of 12 undead skeletons and live to tell the tale, this is not the game for you. You gain no special status by being the player, other than your ability to learn. If you like that, you will LOVE this game. If you dislike having to learn how to play a game properly, you will dislike this game. It is that simple. The immense sense of accomplishment you gain from learning more about this game is what keeps players coming back again and again.- Level Design - Dark Souls understands something that I think Bethesda has missed with Skyrim, and that is that the immensity of a map does not equate to content. Dark souls is by no means a monster of a game, but the number of things to do and places to explore is quite overwhelming. Every nook and cranny of the game is jam-packed with new characters, invisible walls, diverse weapons, and extensions of the storyline. Another thing that is to be applauded is the masterful connectivity between areas. You may not know where you are until you find a shortcut to some previous area you had been. Learning about these shortcuts makes the map a bit easier to traverse, but also puts on display the genius of the game designers. Everything is connected and makes perfect geographical sense. The use of depth to create distance and elevators to reduce it was a stroke of pure genius. It makes it all the more satisfying to travel to an area using the shortcut you found.- The Story - There is as much story in Dark Souls as you want there to be. That is not cryptic language or market-speak either. If you so wish, you can completely ignore the story of Dark Souls and kill everything in the game. For a lore-lover like myself, that would be a travesty. Through dialogue of the NPCs as well as item descriptions, you can gain insight into this deep, rich, and intriguing universe full of betrayals, discovery, wonder, and of course darkness. Many of the NPCs who aid you in battle have motivations, hopes, and backstories of their own which give them reasons to help you along in your quest. Discovering these relationships and motivations is part of Dark Souls' charm.- The Combat - Dark Souls uses a very deceptively simple combat system. Without going into too much detail, melee combat consists of timed attacks and blocking as well as some critical attacks, while the various magics are mediated through their respective ""wands"". When you kill enemies, you acquire souls, the world's currency. These can be used for leveling up, buying items at vendors, or improving items at blacksmiths. Dark Souls rewards players greatly for specializing early, but does not punish those who choose to spread their experience points around. Upgrading weapons and armor encourages you to try many different configurations to find the one that suits you as well as the different enemies you are fighting. For example, you may want to have high fire-resistance for a dragon fight, if you intend to take the flames head on. Another major factor is that Dark Souls contains dynamic weight for your character. Want to wear 120 lbs of armor? That's fine, but you will have to accept that your character is going to move around like a sloth until they are strong enough to move around in it comfortably. All of these factors combined make battles in Dark Souls different every time you play them.- The Bottom Line - So is Dark Souls good? I would go beyond saying Dark Souls is good. It is masterfully simple, rewardingly addictive, and unbelievably rich. If any game this decade was worth full retail, it is this one. And you won't even have to pay that anymore! So buy it!			"

												Let's see.. are you the kind of gamer who's into... Looking for a very challenging but fair game? Something that allows you to play any class or style you want to? A game in which has amazing lore that isn't upfront about it? An experience that will leave you unable to play games like Skyrim ever again? NPCs and characters that will impact you even after you have turned off the game? Jolly co-operation? Holds a DLC that is without a doubt mind blowingly fantastic? Serves you with replay value up to several runs or completely new runs?If any of these clicked with yah, than may I introduce you to Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition as the best candidate for the job. Seriously a masterpiece of a game that at first glance... seems like a hard game. You'll probably die often which will rustle your pants, but when you really pay attention and look into the lore... my god, it's REALLY deep. Apart from games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age, along with Elder Scrolls series- this game holds a record for most hidden lore in gaming history.Mechanics are so well done, that I can't enjoy games like Skyrim anymore without thinking back to how well Dark Souls plays out with the fighting, the classes, how weapons function, ect. I must admit, the co-op needs better support for the servers lack good connection plus how the leveling system works with co-op is flawed. Apart from that, I sincerely pray everyone gives this game a chance. It's one of my top 10 favorite games of all time!			"

												If there's a modern video-game series that can be considered ""Balls-to-the-wall hard"" or ""Nintendo hard""(NES era, mind you), then most people will think of Dark Souls. That being said, after you've finished this game, you'll probably be thinking that The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is for pre pubescent girls. But let me get a little more in-depth on why you should (or shouldn't):Gameplay 8/10: A few MMO/RPG elements are involved in Dark Souls; mainly with stat allocation that includes upgrading strength, dexterity, endurance, etc. with the immensely versatile souls. However, there's quite a few factors that make Dark Souls vastly different than a standard third person hack and slash fantasy. The souls work as both a source of experience points and currency, as well as magic that oddly enough does not rely on the use of mana but rather a predetermined quality that can be used between safe points (Bonfires) are good example that there's a lot of fantasy elements that are changed to the point where Dark Souls can be its own unique thing.Covenants are also a rather unique factor in Dark Souls, as they are the only source of direct online interaction. Like weapons or attributes, covenants can also determine depending solely on your play-style. Do you like PvP and being an evil butt? Try the elusive Darkwraiths. Prefer to have jolly cooperation? Try out the Warrior of Sunlight. Or maybe you just want more honourable duels? Consider Path of the Dragon. All of these alliances play major roles within the PvP/Co-Op scene, and allows for further character customization.There are a couple of flaws with gameplay though, the main issue being the port from Console to Personal Computer systems. Though a lot of bugs with online play and other PC issues have been fixed, the usage of keyboard+mouse is almost always surpassed by using a controller due to the poor controls, making it feel like Dark Souls was never intended to be a PC game. If you have a controller (Playstation brand can work but Xbox is much more suitable), then this issue won't be a huge problem for you.Graphics 7/10: Nothing's really changed significantly between the ports, so Dark Souls loses points for that, along with the lack of mouth movement when people talk, and that Xbox controls are still used within the game (ie. press ""B"" to evade, when it's space on the Keyboard or triangle on Playstation controllers). All these little factors urk me to no end, but I'm not all negative about the graphics (I gave it a 7 after all).On the flip side, the designs of a majority of the creatures and armors are very creative compared to quite a bit of fantasy titles, yet still adds a couple of very cliché monsters (namely: rats and skeletons) to change it up. PC specs are not super demanding, so a lot of people can play Dark Souls without much lag or FPS drops. Some NPC designs are outright deceiving (Petrus of Thorolund is a great example) and it may surprise some players that silly looking characters may be very useful.. Or possibly the opposite~Difficulty 8/10: Ah yes, the most controversial topic. I'm not going to judge this on glitches/exploits or faulty controls, just full on, pure difficulty within the game. You essentially begin the first 5 minutes fighting a 30 foot demon with a broken, rusted half of a sword. That alone should set in what the game has in store for you. Dark Souls' difficulty is fairly consitant and does gradually get more hard up until the halfway point. A lot of bosses initially seem difficult, but when you know of a strategy against them, they become a lot more tolerable with your newly found MLG strats.But then, you'll come across the infamous duo, Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smaugh. Arguably the most difficult bosses in the game, these two will be the deciding factor on whether or not you can win Dark Souls or completely give up. So why mention these behemoths of boss battles? After this point, the difficulty fluctuates, but never really gets harder than this point. This is a fairly severe flaw in my opinion because of how early on this occurs, and these two should appear much later-- even second-to-last bosses of the game. After you deal with them, you can probably just take on any boss/enemy from that point on, which can be a little grating.Story 8/10: It's vague. Not as vague as say, Five Nights at Freddy's, but it's up there. This does the whole ""Chosen One"" cliché but with a little more finesse; as a majority of people in the game are simply unaware of it and you simply have no idea who to trust and who not to. This can create a sort of isolated feeling, which is very strange when it is your generic ""Chosen One"" story. People'll either treat you like dirt or as a simple friend, but nothing really outside of that with the exception of deities and alike who are aware. There's also a nice mix of personalities: You've got the Crestfallen Warrior and Merchant who's shady and pessimistic respectively, but characters like Solaire of Astoria or Siegmeyer of Catarina are a few who are jolly, humble and optimistic about their undeath makes you want to keep going or like them a lot more than most. A blend of characters, although limited, is well done in this title.Overall: I can ramble on about this game for hours upon hours, but I'll leave it as that. Dark Souls is one of those games that is truly unexpecting. You think you're going through a game that is just meant to tear your butt a new one, but has some hidden strategies, fairly good characters and story. If you want a challenge and have that special little high of accomplishing a difficult level or killing off a hard boss, this is the game for you.If you're susceptible to rage, short-patience, or hit things and hope for the best, you might want to stick with Skyrim.

												This game is truly an amazing experience. The atmosphere is amazing and I have never played a souls game that felt this rewarding after a boss. This game is also a lot more punishing than the others. You really have to pay attention and make note of everything that is happening which I love. Though this is a great game, it still has flaws like any other game. Here is my review:Pros:-Beautiful World and Atmosphere-Unforgiving and Challenging-Extremely Rewarding-Cryptic Story and Philosophy-PvP-Combat is well crafted -Exploration is worthwhileCons:-FPS Lock (Can be fixed with DsFix however)-Toxic Snipers (Blighttown in general)-Sometimes boss AOE's feel really cheap (Ceaseless Discharge)-Camera controls can sometimes lead to a cheap deathOverall this game is a great expreience with only minor flaws that can be fixed or controlled. I highly recommend buying this game! "

												First: yes, the port isn't really good. It's pretty much a straight port from Xbox 360 without much work done to accommodate the game for the PC. Second: modders fixed the greatest problems with it, which makes this game far more enjoyable.You are the Chosen One. Destined to save the world. You know, like always. The twist? You are undead. Dying isn't something you need to be really afraid of. You actually shouldn't be afraid of dying, because you will die. A lot.It's a tough game. Even your standard enemies might pose a threat to you.And then come the bosses. Not only can they be quite big and hit REALLY hard, simple attacking them won't do you any good.Learn their attack patterns. Learn when to strike. And after you've learned, die a lot and try again until you get it.Afraid to face the bosses alone? Try jolly co-operation! Turn into a human at a bonfire, summon a player and try to tackle the boss together! But beware of invaders! As soon as you turn human, other players can invade and attack you. And believe me, they will.You also may find some messages left by other players; warning you of great danger, pointing you to amazing chests or tell you to roll down a cliff (don't do that).Be aware that there might be cheaters around, so if you wanna be save from other players, stay undead, but keep in mind that you won't be able to do co-op that way.The story may not be the greatest, but the lore is quite extensive, albeit mostly hidden behind conversations (with some really messed up people) and item descriptions. You want to know something about the world you're in? You'll need to work for it.This also isn't your typical medival fantasy world. There are no populated towns or cities filled with NPCs, shops and quests. It's a post-apocalyptic world, where death and destruction reign supreme.You will encounter the odd friendly NPC here and there, but don't♥♥♥♥♥♥them off or they will try to kill you. Again and again.Beat the game without breaking a sweat? Try New Game+! Done that? Try New Game++! And that gets one for a while.Imo an absolutely fantastic game with a great art direction and lots of challenges to conquer.I'm really glad this game came to the PC. And it did so because of a petition! Isn't that amazing? How often does something like that work?In this regard: Praise the Sun and prepare to die! A lot.			"

												My first and favorite game from ""Souls"" series. Unique game mechanics, great character development system, challenging enemies, high replayability and well maded game balance make this game so unpredictable and thrilling. Compared to Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 there is quality over quantity:- there is no seams in game world- every location is unique- each boss provide some challenge- enjoyable PVP and PVE- memorable soundtrackGood game to start with ""Souls"" series, worth buying.

												PREPARE TO DIE.It's not often when a game's subtitle not only warns me of what lies ahead, but is in fact accurate in such words. You should prepare to die before you start playing this because you will most certainly die. Quite alot. But you probably knew this already, since this game has developed a reputation for itself for being very difficult... and very good. Both are deserved. I'm not going to dig too much into the gameplay and story for this review though, but rather just clearly lay out some things that I feel are worth mentioning:First, you do not need a controller to play this game. You do not need a controller to do well at this game. You do not need a controller to beat this game. My achievements page is living proof of this. You do need mods, specifically dsfix (get this anyway, controller or not), Mouse Fix (or dsmfix), and probably some sort of graphic thing so that you will get keyboard buttons displayed instead of controller ones (You can get all of these mods on the Dark Souls Nexus site: http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls ). Mouse sensitivity will be a problem even with it set to its maximum, but you can manage through with a mix of scrolling and good use of the ""targeting"" button that either forces you to look at a enemy or the direction your character is facing.Is it easier with a controller? No idea. Don't have one. People say it is, but for someone like me who hasn't played console games since the PS2 and therefore would probably do worse with a console simply due to lacking familiarity, I decided to take my chances - and it paid off.You will die alot, but only a few times did I actually start getting frustrated, and that had more to do with my poor execution than the game itself*. Dark Souls is hard, but not cruel. The approach I ended up taking with this game was putting my years of WoW raiding experience to use and treating the bosses in this game much as I did in that smelly MMO. Namely, to figure out what the boss can do, what patterns it might have and recognize them, then kick its♥♥♥♥♥when you are comfortable and know what the foe can do.And that leads to my last thing to bring up: the old saying 'knowledge is power' is very much key here. The more you know, the better you will do at this game. Whether through game experience, going over the excellent wikis, or a combination of the two, figuring out how to deal with the countless lethal situations you will end up in will be of great value. Really, the hardest parts of the game are in the beginning, when you still are just messing about and are not really sure how everything works just yet. Once you do, the game becomes, if not easy, then at least easier to progress through. And when you do finally beat the game, you can be happy that you took the best this ""super hard game"" threw at you and that you were able to overcome it...and then you can do New Game+. Woohoo for more madness! :DAnyway, it's good. Play it because I said so... or something.*(Except for the Bed of Chaos. ♥♥♥♥ that boss.)			"

												This game has made me rage a lot but yetis so rewarding when you go through an impossible bossThis is a game you should totally own.It's sad the fact I haven't been able to enjoy it as much as I'd likebut my problem is not my rig, is not Steam, is not the game difficulty...is GFWL.its... GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. I went through 8 hours to get this running just to be told the ""game is not available"" It's not even in my language, and I can't change it because GFWL won't let me.This, ruined the game. After 10 more hours I had to restore my computer and run my old GFWL account, link it and stuff, then I finally made it running just to be told... MY SAVE GAME WASN'T SAVED.Christ. I'll recommend it anyways, but I hope someday I can see this out of GFWL, so I can enjoy this masterpiece. Meanwhile I'll keep an eye in Dark Souls II.			"

												 With tense dungeon crawling and fearsome enemy encounters, the seamlessly intertwined world of Dark Souls is full of extreme battles, rewarding challenges, nuanced weaponry and magic, and the flexibility to customize each character to suit any desired play style. The innovative online component allows gamers to draw from the collective experience of the Dark Souls community as they either help or sabotage each other on the journey through the world of Lordran to save the land from darkness. With a massive, seamless open world design, Dark Souls encourages deep exploration and an adaptable gameplay experience.			"

												One of the best games i have ever played, period. This action RPG has everything. Including a very high difficulty level. Which is a good thing. As when you finally down a huge boss that has killed you numerous times the sense of satisfaction is immense. If you choose a ranged, magic or melee character (or a mix) the combat is perfect. Every fight is an epic battle. And the bosses are awesome. All 24 of them (give or take 1). The world is huge, varied and non linear. And the PVP/Co-op is unique and fun.Right then now the important part. The standard vanilla game looks awful. It's a straight up port and runs in a muddy 720p @30fps. AND the sound is broken!However all 3 are easily fixed by mods. The textures are so detailed when you crank the res up (you can go way up and downsample to 1080p) it looks beautiful. The 60 fps mod runs like a dream and the quick sound fix restores the entire sound to what it is supposed to be like. It really does make a difference to the atmosphere.EDIT. The sound bug has now been fixed in the last patch :)			"

												What can I say? The game was absolutely incredible. I recently beat Bloodborne when it came out, and it was my first real experience with a ""souls"" type game. I couldnt stop playing it until I finished it, and thats what led me to start seeking out other games made by From Software.So my first choice was this, dark souls. Once you get past the intimidating learning curve, the game opens up to be one of the very best action rpgs out there. My first play through clocked in around 100 hours. The reason being is I took my time and did quite a bit of PvP as well as finishing the DLC before continuing with the main story. The one thing I absolutely love about this game, is that I feel that 99.9% of the time, when you die its your fault and not the game cheating you. The more you die, the more you learn about the enemies. Its a game that requires you to learn the entire map and enemy placements like no other game. Its crazy, when I think in my mind I can map out pretty much the entire game in my mind as well as which enemies are where, and its because its a game that requires you to pay such close attention to detail. All in all, incredible game. Cant wait to get into dark souls 2 scholar of the first sin :D			"

												Let me just start off by saying that this game is amazing and probably the best installment in the Dark Souls series. Well, if you're playing it on console. This is really the worst port I've ever seen. I can't even run the game. That's not because of my hardware, either. The game is so poorly ported that I can't even access the settings or start a new game without it crashing. The time you see that I spent playing the game does not reflect the amount of time I spent outside of the game trying to fix it. Unfortunately I have to refund this amazing game.			"

												This is an edit:At first, I didn't really like the game that much, I tried to speedrun it, only killing the necessary bosses dying all the time, didn't see why that was fun. Didn't enjoy killing bosses, so I quit the game.But then, over 3 years later, I decided to give it a try once more. But this time with a different approach. This time, I would take my time exploring, but also killing every boss. Not only that, but I did some research on what weapons I should use for my style of playing, and for the type of character I created, also I found out what I should spend my souls on.This was a gamechanger for me, because first I just wanted to finish the game, therefore I didn't get the amount of souls that was necessary for me. Now I managed to get further than ever before, because I explored, I picked up items I had never seen before, I got loads of souls to level up, bosses actually became a lot easier than I originally expected them to be.I went for full heavy massive attacks, heavy armor, loads of Vitality, Endurance and Strength.Suddenly I started to appreciate the game, the world and the mood. I still don't feel anything special for killing the bosses, but I appreciate the bosses in a different way, they are actually kinda awesome!If you keep dying forever, then maybe there is something you are missing? Maybe you are rushing too much? Take a step back and observe, even do some research if that's more your style ;)			"

												This game is hard. But it's not hard because it provides it a challenge, it is hard because the game is terrible. The mechanics are inconsistent, random, delayed, clunky, and glitchy. The controls are horrendous and counter-intuitive and cannot be changed. The forced PvP feature is as ridiculous as the rest of the game. There are a lot of great concepts in the game, and they are executed poorly.If you enjoy fighting with your controls, your camera, the responsiveness of your character's actions, and the lock on system more than you enjoy fighting enemies, this game is for you.If you enjoy games that provide extreme challenge with a sense of balance, this game is not for you.

												Dark Souls has a reputation for being a hard game.  I write to clarify that.  Unfortunately, Dark Souls is not difficult because of inventive game mechanics, difficult puzzles, extremely tight hand-eye coordination requirements, etc.  This game is difficult because it is broken out-of-the-box and unplayable without some DIY patching, and otherwise generally poorly coded. Upon loading it for the first time, you'll notice some things:  Resolution doesn't match your settings, the mouse is jittery, the keyboard layout makes zero sense, etc.  God help me, is this a PC game where ESC doesn't open the menu!? Yes!  I have to push a different button to cancel out of a menu depending on which menu it is?  ♥♥♥♥'s sake, guys.  This is a♥♥♥♥♥♥pile beyond all imagining.  Let's say you fix it with some patches, push it to something resembling a professionally made PC game.  Now you get to experience the atrocious bow aiming system, the inability to actually hit a target where you're aiming (target reticle alignment is off for range beyond 25 feet), etc.  Collision is trash - don't bother trying to aim from the left side of a cover wall, you'll have arrows getting stuck in the middle of nowhere.  Backstabs?  Roll the dice if you must, but you're better off not counting on them given the inconsistent nature.  If you find a way to be cheap, you can sneak your way through, taking pot shots at enemies to kill them, resorting to cheesy techniques like abusing the poor walkable terrain mapping for AI (looking at you, crystal giants at Darkroot Basin.)  Still, you'll find yourself at boss battles which are, again, tests in your ability to abuse the poorly-refined fight mechanics rather than tactics and execution. All in all, I killed a lot of bosses and explored most of the game's areas.  Through every minute of it, the nagging feeling that I was pressing on out of stubborness rather than fun made it impossible to continue.  I quit after killing the bellkeepers and the hydra, upon realizing that there was no true challenge in this game - no test of skill, no trials of quick thinking and twitch.  This game is about banging your ♥♥♥♥ing head against the wall until you make a dent - and hoping you don't get randomly invaded by a PVPer upon finding yourself a nice cache of souls. Pass on this trash.			"

												This game. This ONE game.This game sits as a must-have for those who love a challenge. Those who want to explore any path, at any time, in any fashion, this game is built for you. It's difficult to say just WHY It's so good, it just is. From the open world freedom to the player flexibility, It's hard to tell which is better.While most RPGs will have you choose a class and that'll be that, restricting items you can use based on your chosen class, this game abolishes that. You can start a Mage character, but turn it into a tank of Rage and Destruction. The level design is Incredible, enemes are challenging and there are plenty of secrets to find, from weapons to places. The multiplayer is the most innovative and unique experiences I've played, with Singleplayer and Multiplayer seamlessly intertwined with one another. Within this game there are two states that affect your Online experiences: Hollow and Human. Whilst Hollow, you cannot Summon other players to aid you, Invade other players (unless using specific invasion items) or Be Invaded yourself, like a limited online mode. Human form allows you to Summon other players to help you, Invade other players and Be Invaded yourself, the Full Online experience.Again, if you Love challenges, Amazing Game Design and piecing things together yourself (I forgot to mention how much of a minimalistic game this is), then this game is a mmust have.Praise the Sun, and Prepare to Die...

												Dark SoulsPrepare To Die EditionGenre : Action-RPGRating: 10/10Comment : It's the best game I've ever played. It deserved a better pc port'Dark Souls' is a complex dark fantasy action role-playing game that is played from a third person perspective. It has a direct combat system similar to games like the 'Zelda' series. Unlike those it comes with a multiplayer feature: You can cooperatively take on bosses or fight other players to the death. The game is challenging and very rewarding once you achieve something. There are tons of secrets to discover be it gamplay- or story-wise. All these things add up to a high replay value.In my humble opinion 'Dark Souls' is a masterpiece and should be seen as a milestone of videogame history. Edit : Now that Dark Souls works with steamworks I played the game again. Arriving at the 'Firelink Shrine' felt like coming home and I realized that Dark Souls is my all time favourite game. So I changed the rating from 9,5 to 10 although the game still has its technical issues.			"

												It's hard to put into words why I like Dark Souls so much. Well let me just say that you're going to need the patience of a saint, fast reflexes, and the ability to adapt to any situation at any given time if you want to get through this game in it's entirety. Now moving on to the gameplay itself, it's just wonderful. To put it simply, melee combat is the base of this game. You posess a wide variety of swords, bows, sheilds, and magic to defeat the many deadly mobs of enemies that you'll meet in the game. There are many game mechanics that make this game different from other melee focused games, but for now, let's just start with the basics. For starters, there are many ways you can swing and control your weapon. You can attack in light basic swings, or you can go for more damaging and slower attacks. Either way, you'll need to figure out which set of attacks is needed for the current situation. Then there is the ability to parry and riposte. Sure, you can sit there and swing your sword mindlessly, which will most likely get you killed, or you can parry your foes attack, leaving them wide open for a riposte, or counter attack, dealing massive critical damage. Another game mechanic that changes up the playstyle of the game, is the ability to dodge. Sure it doesn't sound so impressive at first, but Dark Souls puts a lot of emphasis into dodging. You could just go through the entire game with a sheild, (wut r u casul m8?) but before you know it, enemies are becoming so strong, that they're able to blast through your sheild like it's nothing. That's where dodging becomes essential. You have the ability to roll through enemies attacks thanks to the use of invincibility frames. Dodging takes a considerable amount of skill, timing, and practice and is one of the game mechanics that really challenges your ability to memorize attack patterns and really take into account how easy it is to screw up and die, which is why I think it's a mechanic that really spices up things in Dark Souls. Anyway these mechanics and so much more really add to why this game's combat is so rewarding and satisfying. Imagine just dying over and over to a boss that you're trying so hard to kill. Then you start to memorize his attack patterns, the way he swings his weapon, how he swings his weapon, how he telegraphs his attacks. You then start dodging all his attacks flawlessly, using patterns of light and heavy swings to take him down with each dodge. The feeling of absolute victory and triumph is what will keep you wanting more. With that being said, I will move on to the environment and world itself. Dark Souls does not have a very linear path or objective, in fact, it encourages you to go in different paths and learn what the objective is for yourself. The game will not hold your hand, and if you die, then that's on you. All the mistakes and deaths are made by you and created by you, so don't blame the game if you're sucking. The most reasonable solution is to just git gud and stop being a casul scrub. Honestly, the environment really supports the vibe of complete loneliness and helplessness. You won't be having much social interactions in this game, save for a few NPC's and most of the time your only company is going to be the mobs of enemies around you. Overall, Dark Souls is a very unforgiving experience that will only get worse with your impatience and lack of skill and know how. If you manage to get past all that, however, and actually learn from your mistakes and manage to not get fed up with the amounts of death and stress you'll have to deal with, then it becomes one of the most memorable and rewaring experiences you could ever have in gaming, ever.

												This game. This ONE game.This game sits as a must-have for those who love a challenge. Those who want to explore any path, at any time, in any fashion, this game is built for you. It's difficult to say just WHY It's so good, it just is. From the open world freedom to the player flexibility, It's hard to tell which is better.While most RPGs will have you choose a class and that'll be that, restricting items you can use based on your chosen class, this game abolishes that. You can start a Mage character, but turn it into a tank of Rage and Destruction. The level design is Incredible, enemes are challenging and there are plenty of secrets to find, from weapons to places. The multiplayer is the most innovative and unique experiences I've played, with Singleplayer and Multiplayer seamlessly intertwined with one another. Within this game there are two states that affect your Online experiences: Hollow and Human. Whilst Hollow, you cannot Summon other players to aid you, Invade other players (unless using specific invasion items) or Be Invaded yourself, like a limited online mode. Human form allows you to Summon other players to help you, Invade other players and Be Invaded yourself, the Full Online experience.Again, if you Love challenges, Amazing Game Design and piecing things together yourself (I forgot to mention how much of a minimalistic game this is), then this game is a mmust have.Praise the Sun, and Prepare to Die... Alot!			"

												Three-hundred hours in I guess it deserves a review...If you just start playing this game blind without watching four or five ""How to play Dark Souls"" videos on youtube, this is a terrible game. Dense, dense, dense. It doesn't tell you how to move, how combat works, or what the game is even about. You've heard that the game is hard, and it is, but before you get over this hump it is technically impossible to play. Some say this is horrible game design, some say it's dense on purpose because it's for ""hardcore gamers."" I'll leave it up to you to decide whether not explaining the mechanics of the game is terrible or hardcore.Ok, now you know how to actually play the game. Now it's no longer impossible, it's just rage inducingly difficult. It almost seems unfair. I mean how are you supposed to fight three enemies one once? This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! Then, on the fifth or sixth time you reach that encounter you realize that if you just strategically take them out, have a plan, think it through, you can take them all out. Sneak up and backstab this guy. Parry then riposte that guy. Roll, block, then strong attack the other guy. This is starting to work. I'm gittin' gud a this!Wait! What in Zeus' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that giant thing!? It's 28 feet tall! It just one shot me!Five or six tries in you begin to see a pattern. Around fifteen to sixteen attempts you start actually getting it down near half health.  On your eight-millionth attempt you are like Neo in the Matrix, rolling out of the way of huge one-shot capable attacks. Dropping two handded attacks on it that take a fifth of it's life off.  You get it. You are in The Zone. You now understand how to play this game. It dies. A luminescent beam streams onto your silhouette as dust motes dance in the ribbon of light around you. A chorus of angels sing. You are God.Then you find the next area and you begin crying.			"

												Abandon the notion that you will  - Play this with the gaming keyboard you spent hundreds of dollars on.-This game will be easy-This game will tell you where to go or give you any indication This is something of a new game, the first of its kind for PC.To enable 60 FPS you will need to get an easy to access yet moderately difficult to optimize mod. This is an action game with hack and slash action. Now, the thing is? It punishes a simple idiot who just berserker slashes his way across the world, because you are gonna run out of energy and get cut.You have an HP bar, magic uses (depending on your job) and an endurance bar. You get tired, yoru character is vulnerable, and the weapons he can use depend on his or her stats. This game epitomizes the word ""difficult"" to newbies. It is uncompromising, unfair, and in a lot of ways it is like life. When I say it is like life, imagine this. You are going into a bad neighborhood, and you are a normal guy with a weapon. And you know what's in a bad neighborhood,  a bunch of normal guys with weapons. If these guys manage to kill you, tough. Restart from a bonfire that somehow bothers to heal you, pick up your dead corpse and raise you from the dead. The game gets harder. Soon you go up against elite soldiers : Pikachu and Snorlax, ""The man"" who is the CEO of a hoarde of ♥♥♥♥in ugly deads,  a blind dragon who is also a scientist who betrayed his own kind, an angry woman who ♥♥♥♥ed herself up, and the old grandpa who won't let go of the past because he was the warrior who built this town from dust.You have to kill them all and become the next lord of the world. Now, let me put that in perspective. You're a normal joe and this game throws you at things that are stronger than you, but you will preservere and advance. You will absorb their essence and you will become stronger than a CEO. You will build something, and you will either martyr yourself for a small change or be the next big CEO who runs this♥♥♥♥♥♥with a bunch of evil snake things bowing before you. What the hell does all of that mean? Find your own answers, fuccboi.			"

												I'm only 5 hours in and I haven't gotten anywhere. It's tough. It's addicting. I recommend it! This is coming from someone who rarely plays RPGs. It's a no-brainer to install DSfix in order to get HD resolution and 60 fps. Kb+mouse support is♥♥♥♥♥ so definitely use a 360 controller (or equivalent). I almost didn't buy this game cause of the things I read about its shoddy conversion to PC, but I took the leap. Installed DSfix, applied a texture upgrade pack, applied a nice SweetFX preset and off I went ...into the brutal world of Dark Souls. At the rate I'm going, I'll be done when I'm 50.There are reports of glitches with 60 fps, so to avoid them, I set a fps cap of 59 in Rivatuner. On a G-Sync monitor, there really is no difference between the two framerates. Smooth at all times.Alrighty then, back to playing Dark Souls...EDIT: I have given up. I'm not gonna play till I'm 50 and jeopardize my marriage for this sh!tload of föck. Neeewwwwwp! Bye bye! Dark Souls, welcome to my ""Just don't bother"" games list. :P			"

												I would describe myself as very new to Dark Souls having not played any of the sequels yet either. With almost 80 hours into DS:PTDE I can say that this would already make it into my top 10 easily.This game can be as deep or superficial as you like depending on your preference and time available to you. On the surface it is a difficult and challenging explorative action game with a decent fighting system that requires patience and strategy, and an intriguing world that provides a looming, fantastical backdrop. Dig deeper and you find that every NPC has a deep backstory and the world is dark and full of a sense of disparing melancholia that speaks thoughout the entire narrative. The level design is among the best I've have seen in recent years as every part of the world feels connected and is cleverly and thoughtfully conceived. The first playthrough (which I still have not completed by this point btw) makes this even more rewarding as you discover how the areas are linked to one another.If you've been thinking about giving the Dark Souls a try the answer is yes and the first one is - as you'd expect - an excellent place to start.*Xbox Controller (or steam pad) recommended!

												There has never been, and I wonder if there ever will be, a game that has had me so immersed and invested. Everything in this game is deliberate, and while hard as nails, there are very few occasions where you feel that the game is unfair. Going into a new area sword swinging and expecting to win will get you slaughtered. Going slow and studying ones surroundings will save you from said death.Unlike many modern titles, Dark Souls never forces the story down your throat, but there is a wide array of lore and detail that an observant eye and an inquisitive mind can discover. And while certain set-pieces are unavoidable, you can play through the game however you want.The replay value is amazing as well. A character based on strength and heavy weapons will play completely different than a nimble and fast character, and all three approaches to magic are distinguised and unique from one another, demanding different playstyles and creating a new experience every time. I have likely made over 50 characters so far, and I still find new and interesting combinations and approaches that I have yet to try, or challenges and limitations to truly test my skill.I would go so far as to say it is my favorite game of all time, and I have been gaming since the Commodore 64.

Fight your way through thick, poisonous sewer sludge until you reach an even more appalling environment.

												Firstly this is the Marmite of PC games you will love it or hate it, it will make you rage, you will get frustated and you will alt+F4 thats the game, but once you begin to realise the basic mechanics and the concept of patience you begin to enjoy it, and get into it, the sense of satisfaction of beating a boss after it has crapped all over you for hours is why you keep playing, the game doesnt hold your hand your taught basics and the rest is up to you.  To find your way around and where to go you need to read item descriptions and talk to the NPC's you encounter, which draw you into the lore and story of the world.Artistically the game looks and feels great it isnt too over the top and everything looks glorious, from the fires of lost izeleth to the sunny city of Anor Londo things look and feel different and the enemies encountered will have you saying WTF!? at points.Theres hundreds of secrets and hidden things lots of different ways to play no this is best build, this is how you beat this boss easy, you do what you want to overcome the challenge so much depth and variety in character and weapon upgrades you can make truly unique combinations, this however also has its downsides as after 80+ hours played i still dont know anything about the differnt weapon upgrades and the differences between a Raw Weapon and a Normal +15 weapon, fire lightning curse and divine are all modifiers for diff enemy types but not required to defeat them.i could go on for ages but i will just score itgraphics 9/10 DSfix makes it look glorious but loses points because its a mod u have to downloadsound 9/10 no real problems but no real stand out iconic soundtrack, its sets the atmosphere and draws you in which is what they wanted i guessCombat 10/10 once you learn what each stat means poise stability etc, and work out how to fight effectively its a realistic enough system and feels good, backstabs parrys feel extra satisfying.Story 7/10 I love the story but feel its told in a way that leaves you with too many gaps to fill in, guess thats the intrigue and why you play more to see bits you missed before or find out what happens if you do something different, I really like this way of story telling but just feel it could have been done in a more conclusive way, you are left assuming too much by the end, a little clarification of what happens and why would have been welcome. To enjoy the story, and to get it you NEED to talk to everyone and listen to what they say and read item descriptions even on armour, wepaons, and items you use they all add extra layers to your understanding or extra questions that you seek answers for, its Awesome how it makes you think, but for some i feel the lack of a conclusive ending or a Clear end may put them off.Overall a mighty 9/10 from me, you will need patience and you will get mad, but just turn it off and keep coming back, dont try to play it like diablo you cant take everything on at once, one at a time learn the enemies learn the parry points if you want to show off and feel real good but mostly just Take your time look around and ENJOY it.

												I am an avid gamer, especially for RPG's, and I must say, first time I played Dark Souls, I got brutally murdered, over and over. However, it is a major learning game that the more you play and die, and learn the environment, the more it rewards you with the knowledge from the countless deaths and time spent learning. Expect to die. Expect to die a lot, the game developer, FromSoftware, even tells you ""Prepare to Die"", but don't let that deter you from this amazing and immersive game. The evironments are rather different and will allow you to learn each one.When you feel you know the game well enough, make a new character with new fighting styles, go full Dexterity, handling fast, but light hitting weapons, or go heavy, hard hitting with Strength, or balance the two out. Melee not your thing? Make a pyromancer, mage, or cleric, calling upon the powers of the fire, magic, or miracles. Mix and match your character and find a build that feels fit for you. I say nearly infinite replayability with the sheer amount of possible builds, as well as challenge builds/runs you can set for yourself (I currently and going through the game as a level 1 character).As for tips, the best I can offer would be to explore and focus on learning everything you can from every death. Oh, and I highly recommend getting a PS3 controller or Xbox 360 controller to play this, since the mouse+keyboard controls are complete sh*t.As of right now, PvP is kind of dead in most areas, but it still can be rather active, especially with the hype for Dark Souls 2 coming right around the corner, people are coming back.To help further your online experience, I would highly recommend downloading the DSfix and DSCfix mods, for better graphics and FPS and allowing you to connect to people on your Games for Windows Live friends list much easier and faster. Do not worry however, DSCfix does NOT affect random summonings or invading, it simply helps team you and friends up.			"

												I've recently completed this game upon knowing Dark Souls III would be coming out on April 11th. Probably the best game to experience for the decade in my opinion. It has challenging boss fights with gorgeous music and unique stage designs that all tie into one area, Firelink Shrine, the main bonfire... With such a mysterious story, speaking in things such as metaphores most the time, the game is very hard to understand on a first playthrough. That being said, if you read into each item and piece of equipment you picked up, it contains minor info that you can piece together into something amazingly interesting. A very challenging game it is, not being friendly to new players and unoptimized to all ♥♥♥♥. I've successfully added HD texture mods, as well as an ENB, max settings and all, and I recieve around 75 max fps (capped, it breaks the game engine beyond 60fps most the time) and 30 at the lowest.

												Dark Souls is about much more than just getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you on a plate. It's about getting up when you've gotten you♥♥♥♥♥kicked. It's about asking why you have to do somethingIt's about deciding what to doIt's about fearing what's nextIt's a game unlike any other, where you've got to be smart and learn from every mistake you make, mistakes which are often greeted with death. But it's a game where you have to sit, observe, and think. Also the port is slightly less♥♥♥♥♥♥now that GFWL is dead so would 420blaze again.			"

												Lets get the bad stuff out of the way first. Out of the box, the game only renders at 720p, then upscales and has prety poor mouse and keyboard controls.Both of these were actually fixed by modders either right after release or shortly before. The game does look amazing with downsampling, SSAO, and SSMA after the Durante fix. And from what I hear the mouse patch is great, though I use a controller which works perfectly.With that out of the way, the game actually runs really well and plays even better. Already one of my favorite games of all time, with serious replayability.  The game is incredibly deep and has a great multiplayer online system for co-op and pvp. I get a constant 30 fps as well, which rarely dips and only about a 40-60% gpu usage even with the higher fidelity settings.I'm a first time player, but the new content was some of the best in the game. Definitley a great pickup.			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, plain and simple.However, I think the fact that it's known for being difficult really undersells what this game is about. Yes, it's got a rather steep difficulty curve. Most players that start off may only play the first hour and turn it off because they have no idea what's going on. Fewer still will power through and break the wall that is the first area. The game is hard... but that's not what makes this game amazing. Not even close.What really sells this game for me is the atmosphere and the enemy/level design. This is high fantasy at its finest, and this isn't something you want to miss if you enjoy things such as magic and swords. Each area is unique and plays wonderfully off the themes commonly found in Tolkein-esque fantasy.And yet it's something all its own.Also, the swordplay is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and the combat mechanics are really deep and involved. You'll have difficulty finding a game like this where combat mechanics actually work as well as they do without being overly complicated.10/10, come play it.			"

												Dark Souls is quite possibly one of the greatest games I have ever played, and I say this having hated the beginning of the game for how challenging it was for me. But after a while, you begin to learn the way the game works, you begin to decode its unique and mysterious systems, world, and characters, and eventually you hit a groove and everything clicks. The reward for defeating the game's various bosses and for discovering hidden items, as well as mounting the insurmountable countless times, is absolutely amazing. Dark Souls demands that you put a part of yourself into it, and it gives back so, so much because of this.			"

												Firstly, Dark Souls for PC is a terrible port, but I believe a patch solves many of its problems. You need to install a patch for PC (http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/08/24/upgrade-dark-souls-pc-version-visuals) which counters the limited resolution. Just make sure you disable anti-aliasing or the game window will not be fully visible. Recommended for fans of challenging games. This isn't achievement in the form of random steam achievements, but learning how to fight each individual enemy. The sucessful player dispatches their enemies through correct timing of blocking, attacking and dodging. Weapon types are numerous and actually matter, especially the balance between thrusting and slashing attacks. However, once you have selected a weapon or two, it is hard to change due to commiting to weapon upgrades. Also, I would have liked to have seen more variation in combat (more attack combinations). The dark, gritty atmosphere of the game with views stretching long into the distance really make the game for me. While not as open world as I expected, each zone looks flawless and varied compared to the last. The world reminds me a lot of Soul Reaver's Nosgoth. In the same way, the world is fairly unoccupied creating a feeling of bleak lonliness. You, the player, know that the only way out is defeating boss after boss. Acting as a major negative point against the game is the multiplayer. Really, it is terrible both in design and balance. As an avid PvPer used to high level WoW arena and League of Legends, I found the PvP similar to a max level player ganking a lowbie in Stranglethorn Vale, totally devoid of any skill. Whilst you are meant to be matched to players of similar level, every player coming to my world has been a twinked pyromancer (imbalanced pvp) with an array of bombs. Once they're in your world, they can and will attack you during mid-combat. You can mostly avoid the ganking but some points in the game require you to be very vunerable. If you want to enjoy a vastly difficult co-op campaign together with one of your best buddies, then this isn't for you. But as a single player title, it's fairly solid. 7/10			"

												This game. This ONE game.This game sits as a must-have for those who love a challenge. Those who want to explore any path, at any time, in any fashion, this game is built for you. It's difficult to say just WHY It's so good, it just is. From the open world freedom to the player flexibility, It's hard to tell which is better.While most RPGs will have you choose a class and that'll be that, restricting items you can use based on your chosen class, this game abolishes that. You can start a Mage character, but turn it into a tank of Rage and Destruction. The level design is Incredible, enemes are challenging and there are plenty of secrets to find, from weapons to places. The multiplayer is the most innovative and unique experiences I've played, with Singleplayer and Multiplayer seamlessly intertwined with one another. Within this game there are two states that affect your Online experiences: Hollow and Human. Whilst Hollow, you cannot Summon other players to aid you, Invade other players (unless using specific invasion items) or Be Invaded yourself, like a limited online mode. Human form allows you to Summon other players to help you, Invade other players and Be Invaded yourself, the Full Online experience.Again, if you Love challenges, Amazing Game Design and piecing things together yourself (I forgot to mention how much of a minimalistic game this is), then this game is a mmust have.Praise the Sun, and Prepare to Die... Alot!			"

												A masterpiece. This game is fabled to extremely challenging, and to any new player, it is. The difficulty in Dark Souls is masked as a lack of knowledge: Once you try something new (be it take a different route, use a different weapon style or talk to a certain npc), you gain KNOWLEDGE. As you play, you learn more and more about the game, arming yourself with the know-how and the strategy to succeed. Dark souls rewards those who are curious enough to try something new, or creative enough to solve problems a different way. If you are willing to think outside the box by learning from your mistakes rather than repeating them, the payoff is huge. That 100th attempt to kill that boss where you succeed makes the 99 times you died seem like it was not so bad, although by death number 20 you were probably ready to smash your controller. The boss fights are all unique, challenging in their own way, and most impressively of all: completely fair. If you died, it was because of your fault. Not the game. The combat in this game is clean cut and impartial. And the mistakes? You will make many. My first playthrough took probably about 50 hours (If I were to guess) and that was with help from a couple of friends giving me some minor hints along the way. You will have to put in the time, serious undivided attention, to get past some areas without external help. Getting your feet wet is the hardest part; once you start swimming (ie understand the basic mechanics of the game) it's a blast. The actual campaign, for an experienced player, does not take very long (4-8 hours, speed-runnable in under 2 hours by experts) once you're armed with all that knowledge in your first rodeo. The game has good replayability (that's a word now!). The single player restarts itself each time you beat it, allowing you to keep all your level ups+equipment, but the monsters get much more lethal. There's a great player vs player system in the game, with almost balanced combat allowing for a huge variety of PvP character builds to be explored. Let's talk about the bad. It's a port - it was made for the Xbox 360. The controls suck for PC, you'll NEED a controller. Seriously. Don't play with a Mouse+KB. Just don't. Get a PS3/Xbox360 controller and MotionJoy software to use it (it's not the greatest piece of software, but it'll do). You'll also need to download a community-made fix, for your resolution unless you enjoy calculator-quality graphics. There are a few minor to not so minor bugs in the game that you may come across. One particular section of the game is very laggy, even on a good computer. Lastly, the connectivity is horrid. It relies on Games for Windows Live, which is terrible for PC gaming. When trying to hook up with a friend to fight a boss, or trying to invade someone to fight another player, you will spend A LOT of time waiting around, failing to join. It sucks, but it does work eventually. A fix exists to better allow players that are friends with each other on GFWL to connect to each other much better, though. I would recommend this game to anyone who has the patience to stick with it and keep trying new things until they succeed, anyone who has the willpower to keep playing without seeking external help to pass an area (that's just cheating yourself; it's seriously not worth it in the end! Your first play through is your most memorable, without a doubt), or to anyone who is looking for a RPG unlike any other modern game available. All in all? The only gaming experience I can compare this to is playing an old Zelda game where you find a new item (say, Flippers) that all of a sudden opens up much of the world that was previously inaccessible to you before. That feeling is Dark Souls - only the you don't have to open a chest to get this empowerment in the form of a new item, you just have to open your mind and explore this masterpiece of a game.			"

												You'll either love it, and by love it i mean it will probably be one of the better games you've ever played and it might give you a hard time in finding satisfaction in another game for some time. On the contrary, some people don't see its greatness, some perhaps because they give up and others just might not, as i said, see its greatness . The game creates a certain atmosphere thats hard to come by in any other game. The npcs/ characters has a sort of mysterious feeling about them and the areas likewise. The bossbattles and their soundtracks are unforgettable. Overall i cant recommend this game enough but of course this is the words of someone that simply loves dark souls so make of this what you want. The game is often on sale but even at full price it's a must buy.			"

Landing a reposte, even after the thousandth time, fills me with satisfaction.+ Fantastic and rewarding combat+ Many weapons, shields and armor sets to mix & match+ Excellent use of multiplayer (invasions, co-operation and PvP)+ Gorgeous enviroments and ambiance+ Interesting enemy design, each with their own specific attack patterns+ Great level system and statistic allocation+ Deep and enticing lore once invested in+ Lautrec's voice actor ;)- Poor console port; suffers from a locked frame rate, no graphical options, low quality textures and text- Games for Windows Live (From Software has stated they will be changing the infrastructure when this system shuts down July, 2014)- Corrupt save data/no cloud storage (this always happened to me after formatting my computer)This game receives a 9/10 and should not be overlooked even if Dark Souls 2 is slated for release in a couple months.

Tho being a console port, there are somethings to expect here, poor kb+m support, you pretty much need a 360 controler or equivalant, Graphics are locked at 30 fps and 720p, increasing your resolution will only upscale the textures.  The game is poorly optimized for PC. All in all its a great game that suffers from being portly.			"

												(Before reading the following scenario, be aware that the last paragraph is about how awesome this game is and you should get it)_______________________________________________After spending 10-30 minutes crafting a unique character to portray your identity, you find yourself already dead at the beginning of the game, or undead so to speak. This is probably for the best, because if you were to start alive, the game would be more than willing to kill you as many times as it needs to until you've become a bloody conglamerate of what appears to be flesh.For the first 40 hours of gameplay, you are given these instructions; ring two bells. Where? How? Why? Well if it told you, where would the fun be? Instead of having a fluffy NPC tell you ""Oh Bob, you should probably turn around and head to undead burg"" they take the obviously more effective approach and rather place a prowling demon with 2000 health or a lake of lava containing 7 bosses to kill you, implying the message in your head ""Hm...

												I am an avid gamer, especially for RPG's, and I must say, first time I played Dark Souls, I got brutally murdered, over and over. However, it is a major learning game that the more you play and die, and learn the environment, the more it rewards you with the knowledge from the countless deaths and time spent learning. Expect to die. Expect to die a lot, the game developer, FromSoftware, even tells you ""Prepare to Die"", but don't let that deter you from this amazing and immersive game. The evironments are rather different and will allow you to learn each one.When you feel you know the game well enough, make a new character with new fighting styles, go full Dexterity, handling fast, but light hitting weapons, or go heavy, hard hitting with Strength, or balance the two out. Melee not your thing? Make a pyromancer, mage, or cleric, calling upon the powers of the fire, magic, or miracles. Mix and match your character and find a build that feels fit for you. I say nearly infinite replayability with the sheer amount of possible builds, as well as challenge builds/runs you can set for yourself (I currently and going through the game as a level 1 character).As for tips, the best I can offer would be to explore and focus on learning everything you can from every death. Oh, and I highly recommend getting a PS3 controller or Xbox 360 controller to play this, since the mouse+keyboard controls are complete sh*t.As of right now, PvP is kind of dead in most areas, but it still can be rather active, especially with the hype for Dark Souls 2 coming right around the corner, people are coming back.To help further your online experience, I would highly recommend downloading the DSfix and DSCfix mods, for better graphics and FPS and allowing you to connect to people on your Games for Windows Live friends list much easier and faster. Do not worry however, DSCfix does NOT affect random summonings or invading, it simply helps team you and friends up.			"

												I've recently completed this game upon knowing Dark Souls III would be coming out on April 11th. Probably the best game to experience for the decade in my opinion. It has challenging boss fights with gorgeous music and unique stage designs that all tie into one area, Firelink Shrine, the main bonfire... With such a mysterious story, speaking in things such as metaphores most the time, the game is very hard to understand on a first playthrough. That being said, if you read into each item and piece of equipment you picked up, it contains minor info that you can piece together into something amazingly interesting. A very challenging game it is, not being friendly to new players and unoptimized to all ♥♥♥♥. I've successfully added HD texture mods, as well as an ENB, max settings and all, and I recieve around 75 max fps (capped, it breaks the game engine beyond 60fps most the time) and 30 at the lowest. This game is really worth the time and effort if you enjoy rewarding games that are ceasing to exist in this modern era of gaming.

It must be experienced for yourself, watching playthroughs would only hinder your experience.In order for you to have the BEST experience, though, I recommend you get DSFix for graphics, resolution, and framerate.  And Wulf's Connectivity Mod for jolly cooperation or pvp.Now you too can be so grossly incandescent.			"

												Firstly this is the Marmite of PC games you will love it or hate it, it will make you rage, you will get frustated and you will alt+F4 thats the game, but once you begin to realise the basic mechanics and the concept of patience you begin to enjoy it, and get into it, the sense of satisfaction of beating a boss after it has crapped all over you for hours is why you keep playing, the game doesnt hold your hand your taught basics and the rest is up to you.  To find your way around and where to go you need to read item descriptions and talk to the NPC's you encounter, which draw you into the lore and story of the world.Artistically the game looks and feels great it isnt too over the top and everything looks glorious, from the fires of lost izeleth to the sunny city of Anor Londo things look and feel different and the enemies encountered will have you saying WTF!? at points.Theres hundreds of secrets and hidden things lots of different ways to play no this is best build, this is how you beat this boss easy, you do what you want to overcome the challenge so much depth and variety in character and weapon upgrades you can make truly unique combinations, this however also has its downsides as after 80+ hours played i still dont know anything about the differnt weapon upgrades and the differences between a Raw Weapon and a Normal +15 weapon, fire lightning curse and divine are all modifiers for diff enemy types but not required to defeat them.i could go on for ages but i will just score itgraphics 9/10 DSfix makes it look glorious but loses points because its a mod u have to downloadsound 9/10 no real problems but no real stand out iconic soundtrack, its sets the atmosphere and draws you in which is what they wanted i guessCombat 10/10 once you learn what each stat means poise stability etc, and work out how to fight effectively its a realistic enough system and feels good, backstabs parrys feel extra satisfying.Story 7/10 I love the story but feel its told in a way that leaves you with too many gaps to fill in, guess thats the intrigue and why you play more to see bits you missed before or find out what happens if you do something different, I really like this way of story telling but just feel it could have been done in a more conclusive way, you are left assuming too much by the end, a little clarification of what happens and why would have been welcome. To enjoy the story, and to get it you NEED to talk to everyone and listen to what they say and read item descriptions even on armour, wepaons, and items you use they all add extra layers to your understanding or extra questions that you seek answers for, its Awesome how it makes you think, but for some i feel the lack of a conclusive ending or a Clear end may put them off.Overall a mighty 9/10 from me, you will need patience and you will get mad, but just turn it off and keep coming back, dont try to play it like diablo you cant take everything on at once, one at a time learn the enemies learn the parry points if you want to show off and feel real good but mostly just Take your time look around and ENJOY it.

												Challenging?  Yes it is!  Will you die?  Repeatedly!  Confusing?  Sometimes.   Great game if you can handle a challenge, and are willing to research some specs for your play style.  Tho being a console port, there are somethings to expect here, poor kb+m support, you pretty much need a 360 controler or equivalant, Graphics are locked at 30 fps and 720p, increasing your resolution will only upscale the textures.  The game is poorly optimized for PC. All in all its a great game that suffers from being portly.			"

												Three-hundred hours in I guess it deserves a review...If you just start playing this game blind without watching four or five ""How to play Dark Souls"" videos on youtube, this is a terrible game. Dense, dense, dense. It doesn't tell you how to move, how combat works, or what the game is even about. You've heard that the game is hard, and it is, but before you get over this hump it is technically impossible to play. Some say this is horrible game design, some say it's dense on purpose because it's for ""hardcore gamers."" I'll leave it up to you to decide whether not explaining the mechanics of the game is terrible or hardcore.Ok, now you know how to actually play the game. Now it's no longer impossible, it's just rage inducingly difficult. It almost seems unfair. I mean how are you supposed to fight three enemies one once? This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! Then, on the fifth or sixth time you reach that encounter you realize that if you just strategically take them out, have a plan, think it through, you can take them all out. Sneak up and backstab this guy. Parry then riposte that guy. Roll, block, then strong attack the other guy. This is starting to work. I'm gittin' gud a this!Wait! What in Zeus' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that giant thing!? It's 28 feet tall! It just one shot me!Five or six tries in you begin to see a pattern. Around fifteen to sixteen attempts you start actually getting it down near half health.  On your eight-millionth attempt you are like Neo in the Matrix, rolling out of the way of huge one-shot capable attacks. Dropping two handded attacks on it that take a fifth of it's life off.  You get it. You are in The Zone. You now understand how to play this game. It dies. A luminescent beam streams onto your silhouette as dust motes dance in the ribbon of light around you. A chorus of angels sing. You are God.Then you find the next area and you begin crying.			"

												I love this game, because it's unforgiving. The feeling of screwing up and getting mad, then later flying through with ease, is the real reward. Defeating overwhelming bosses, going through beautiful environments, and getting invaded by phantoms (PvP) all give the game is notorious name. Not for casual players.			"

												A masterpiece. This game is fabled to extremely challenging, and to any new player, it is. The difficulty in Dark Souls is masked as a lack of knowledge: Once you try something new (be it take a different route, use a different weapon style or talk to a certain npc), you gain KNOWLEDGE. As you play, you learn more and more about the game, arming yourself with the know-how and the strategy to succeed. Dark souls rewards those who are curious enough to try something new, or creative enough to solve problems a different way. If you are willing to think outside the box by learning from your mistakes rather than repeating them, the payoff is huge. That 100th attempt to kill that boss where you succeed makes the 99 times you died seem like it was not so bad, although by death number 20 you were probably ready to smash your controller. The boss fights are all unique, challenging in their own way, and most impressively of all: completely fair. If you died, it was because of your fault. Not the game. The combat in this game is clean cut and impartial. And the mistakes? You will make many. My first playthrough took probably about 50 hours (If I were to guess) and that was with help from a couple of friends giving me some minor hints along the way. You will have to put in the time, serious undivided attention, to get past some areas without external help. Getting your feet wet is the hardest part; once you start swimming (ie understand the basic mechanics of the game) it's a blast. The actual campaign, for an experienced player, does not take very long (4-8 hours, speed-runnable in under 2 hours by experts) once you're armed with all that knowledge in your first rodeo. The game has good replayability (that's a word now!). The single player restarts itself each time you beat it, allowing you to keep all your level ups+equipment, but the monsters get much more lethal. There's a great player vs player system in the game, with almost balanced combat allowing for a huge variety of PvP character builds to be explored. Let's talk about the bad. It's a port - it was made for the Xbox 360. The controls suck for PC, you'll NEED a controller. Seriously. Don't play with a Mouse+KB. Just don't. Get a PS3/Xbox360 controller and MotionJoy software to use it (it's not the greatest piece of software, but it'll do). You'll also need to download a community-made fix, for your resolution unless you enjoy calculator-quality graphics. There are a few minor to not so minor bugs in the game that you may come across. One particular section of the game is very laggy, even on a good computer. Lastly, the connectivity is horrid. It relies on Games for Windows Live, which is terrible for PC gaming. When trying to hook up with a friend to fight a boss, or trying to invade someone to fight another player, you will spend A LOT of time waiting around, failing to join. It sucks, but it does work eventually. A fix exists to better allow players that are friends with each other on GFWL to connect to each other much better, though. I would recommend this game to anyone who has the patience to stick with it and keep trying new things until they succeed, anyone who has the willpower to keep playing without seeking external help to pass an area (that's just cheating yourself; it's seriously not worth it in the end! Your first play through is your most memorable, without a doubt), or to anyone who is looking for a RPG unlike any other modern game available. All in all? The only gaming experience I can compare this to is playing an old Zelda game where you find a new item (say, Flippers) that all of a sudden opens up much of the world that was previously inaccessible to you before. That feeling is Dark Souls - only the you don't have to open a chest to get this empowerment in the form of a new item, you just have to open your mind and explore this masterpiece of a game.			"

												An extremely challenging game in which i so wholly enjoy. The mere basics of this game makes it challenging with unforgiving aspects such as extremely hard bosses, aggressive enemies, and fast moving damage dealers. This game as well has alot of variety including builds such as dex (dexterity) builds, builds based around miracles and your faith, strength weapons that require inhuman strength but pays that back with overwhelming damage, and builds where you just focus all of your souls into your pyromancy flame (Straight Pyromancer Build). I have played this game and i have tried most builds. They have their strengths and weaknesses from pyromancy being almost useless against smaug and his friend. To enemies who are very vulnerable to flame. I would rate this game a straight 10/10 for how challenging, fun, and its great co-op system, i am very proud of this game and can never get bored of it.

												You'll either love it, and by love it i mean it will probably be one of the better games you've ever played and it might give you a hard time in finding satisfaction in another game for some time. On the contrary, some people don't see its greatness, some perhaps because they give up and others just might not, as i said, see its greatness . The game creates a certain atmosphere thats hard to come by in any other game. The npcs/ characters has a sort of mysterious feeling about them and the areas likewise. The bossbattles and their soundtracks are unforgettable. Overall i cant recommend this game enough but of course this is the words of someone that simply loves dark souls so make of this what you want. The game is often on sale but even at full price it's a must buy.			"

												So far, this game is my favourite game of all time. I have played over 200 hours of it and I still feel like I've only just started the game. I have to admit, the PC port of this game isn't great and you have to install a mod (DSFix) to be able to even play the game without the 30FPS cap, among other problems. Overall, the game is really well written and really well put together.I think the reason many people don't carry on with this game (Less than half of all players of the game have even beaten the first boss) is because it's hard to get into. You die a lot in Dark Souls, but it's not punishing. The game lets you learn from it and get better as you die more, meaning you get better the more experience you have.			"

												Having just completed my first playthrough of the game, I feel like I can finally review it.It's hard.Not hard in the sense of there's plenty of BS to go around, but hard because you know /nothing/.You're punished for not paying attention, or not reacting. You can't just all-out aggro or turtle up and expect to survive.PVP is incredibly fun, and etiquette is most important when facing another player.My recommendation is to learn as much about the game as you can without spoiling yourself before diving in head first.And remember, there are consequences to your actions. Trust no-one.I have tried many times to play it and I found myself not enjoying it a lot. Give it time, don't rush through it and most importantly, Praise the Sun!You will feel like this sometimes.

												The ""flawed masterpiece"" - If you've yet to play any of the souls games, this isn't a bad place to start. This game will force you to learn how to play it well... If you don't tap out first.PVP is ridiculous most of the time, thanks largely to latency between players.The game favours exposition in the form of anecdotes, item descriptions, and canny world design. A very rewarding experience for people who like to immerse themselves in the culture and lore of a particular story. Very little context is force-fed to the player, and must be sought out.Gameplay itself is very rewarding; players are rewarded for playing well, and punished heavily upon making critical mistakes.

As well as that, when you move the camera it shakes and wobbles for whatever reason.The most unforgivable is the fact that the control prompts (such as 'press mouse 1 to attack') are not properly intergrated. At all. Meaning the game will prompt you to press A, B, X, RB, LB, Move right/left analog stick etc as if you were using a controller... even when your not.Luckily you can change the keys in the option menu, but even then it's clunky.And to top it all off the game uses Games for Windows Live.

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, plain and simple.However, I think the fact that it's known for being difficult really undersells what this game is about. Yes, it's got a rather steep difficulty curve. Most players that start off may only play the first hour and turn it off because they have no idea what's going on. Fewer still will power through and break the wall that is the first area. The game is hard... but that's not what makes this game amazing. Not even close.What really sells this game for me is the atmosphere and the enemy/level design. This is high fantasy at its finest, and this isn't something you want to miss if you enjoy things such as magic and swords. Each area is unique and plays wonderfully off the themes commonly found in Tolkein-esque fantasy.And yet it's something all its own.Also, the swordplay is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and the combat mechanics are really deep and involved. You'll have difficulty finding a game like this where combat mechanics actually work as well as they do without being overly complicated.10/10, come play it.			"

												Dark Souls is quite possibly one of the greatest games I have ever played, and I say this having hated the beginning of the game for how challenging it was for me. But after a while, you begin to learn the way the game works, you begin to decode its unique and mysterious systems, world, and characters, and eventually you hit a groove and everything clicks. The reward for defeating the game's various bosses and for discovering hidden items, as well as mounting the insurmountable countless times, is absolutely amazing. Dark Souls demands that you put a part of yourself into it, and it gives back so, so much because of this.			"

												A controller will greatly benefit your experience in this game. I also recommend the DSfix Mod. This is one of those games that feels good to beat. Winning feels like an accomplishment because the game rarely pulls its punches. The world is dangerous and filled with horrible things that want nothing more than to kill you, again and again. But almost everything in the game feels fair. I never truly found myself dieing because the game was unfair. I found myself dieing because I didn't play with a plan, because I rushed in without caution, because I became impatient. It's not a game for everyone. If you don't enjoy the taste of accomplishment that comes from wallowing in defeat you may not enjoy this game. If you don't like putting the story together yourself by collecting bits of story from exploring the world you may find the narritive lacking. If you don't care to learn about the mechanics of the combat you will hit a wall in terms of progress. In terms of cost to enjoyment ratio, it's a great deal.

												This game feels EXACTLY like War of the Roses, another game that takes place in a similar medieval setting with realistic physics (meaning the jumps aren't like those videogames where you can literally jump higher than your own height etc) You roll and you feel the weight of your body as your armor smashes into the stone floor of some underground ruins. You could even say it is the RPG version of that game, since that game is only for purely PVP.This also reminds me alot of Monster Hunter, with all the big boss battles etc. Expect epic Hydra and Dragon fights. The game becomes easier by several folds if you have a party, so try to do some side line soloing too if you wish to truly enjoy the intended difficulty of the game. I tend to let my friends walk ahead of me in our parties, so that they may also enjoy the fun of being tricked into chasing a naked zombie and then realizing it was a bait to an ambush, and that all too famous black knight one-hit-kill with his huge sword as soon as my friend climbs unsuspectingly to the top of the tower stairs and pops his head up seconds before it gets split into two.

The only complaint I have about it is the PC port, which is indeed horrible, you cannot rebind keys and you will need a controller to play it, other than that it's a great game!Oh, forgot to say: people say you NEED mods to make it work, but that's not true at all, I personally never user any mods and you can see how much I played this, so don't worry.

												Dark Souls is a truly unforgettable gaming experience. Known for its difficulty, it really isn't TOO difficult once you get used to the mechanics. There are a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and three magic styles, each one having a different feel. The story, while seeming shallow at first, has quite a bit of depth if you are willing to look for it. And after all is said and done, there's still the multiplayer...EDIT: Nominated for Test of Time.			"

												-----------------------------SPOILERS--------------------------------------The Dark Souls series is probably my favorite series in gaming. I spend quite alot of time in these games and they helped me through the hardest time of my life. Most people probably try to cheer themself up íf they are depressed when i was depressed i played a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of Dark souls (Most of the time in offline mode) so i thought that i am going to play through every game i own which is: Dark Souls: PTDE, Dark Souls II, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the first sin and Dark Souls III and write a review and say my overall opinion about the Souls series probably no one cares but neither do i if someone will read this.So without talkin much more lets get to the first game: ""Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition. For me and probably most people this was the first souls game i ever played. I played it after getting hyped from seeing dark souls II on youtube but i couldn't play it so i decided to play the first game instead until it's released for PC and... i got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked. The first boss i troubled with was the Taurus demon (pathetic) to beat that boss for the first time i had to try it about 10 times. After i beat him and got to the Gargoyls and... just stopped playing after i wasn't able to beat them. So by that time Dark Souls II was released for PC and after playing through the entire game i went back to the first game. I started over and... had a rather easy time. I killed the Taurus demon and the Gargoyls in under an hour. I didn't know where to go after that tho so i ran around for 2h without getting anywhere in the game but after that i discovered that i can now open a door after the Taurus Demon which lead me to the lower area of undead burg i found the Capra Demon and i hate him until today the boss is just bad designed the 2 dogs make it more harder than it needs to be and the small arena is just not very nice to deal with but after finally slaying the beast i went further on my epic adventure. So  i could tell about the entire game but i don't have to please instead of reading this review just get this game and play it if you have a xbox controller (you really need one).The Graphics are fine for the time. But WTF were they thinking when designing the area before Seath the Scaleless... looks more like grass textures from 2000 when some of the first 3D games came out.Gameplay is just... Perfect. Thats something that is special about the first game it's so easy to be either OP or Weak. If you are going to get a Black Knight weapon this maybe is the easiest game in the series because they are easy to upgrade and do a ton of damage i can advice you... don't use them if you want the full experience. Sadly the coop is not that play able anymore because almost no one is playing this game for it, it's a buggy mess with summoning being very unreliable and most of the time it doesn't work. PvP is a laggy mess nothing else to say about it. The bosses are the best part of the entire game just forget about the♥♥♥♥♥♥fights like Bed of Chaos and tbh every fight in lost izalith is just there but the rest of the bosses are really great i will just point some of them out: Smough and Ornstein,  Gwyn, Sif and the legendary Knight Artorias.At the end of the Dark Souls III review i will say what the best Game is in my opinion and the best boss etc. So can i recommend this game? Do you really need to ask this? Get this game play it LOVE.Thx for reading have a nice day. ^^			"

												This game surprises with so many never before seen ideas in my gaming lifetime. Something I love most is that you really need to learn how to navigate and control your character, no invisible walls to keep you from diving off the edge into that lovely sunset, nope. You take a bad step and it's pahnkake(unenforceable copyright pending) status for you. And surprisingly a stroll across a small ledge over a deep chasm gives a great adrenaline rush and satisfaction when you succeed in defeating a ledge boss, also being wary of elevator bosses is necessary too. If you block or parry someones attack, you'd better time it right, because it takes perfect timing. However you will be surprised at how proficient you can become at anticipating peoples attacks with practice, and you can use regular computer controlled enemies for that. And if you parry them, it leaves them open for a riposte (meaning an undefended attack that allows for a great finishing attack) which in most cases is an insta-kill, or at least a huge hit. And the killing blow for backstabs and riposte' are always fantastic to watch.The game is for a majority of the time a Single Player experience but has an integrated PvP system divided into ""worlds"" or ""dimensions"" if you will, meaning that people can invade your world to kill you, or join your world as a cooperative help to make difficult area's less punishing and more enjoyable, but not easy. Note that the age of the game and it's use of Games For Windows Live have allowed for somewhat of a cheating infestation, it doesn't by any means make the game unplayable though.I haven't before gone into details because I'm really just that lazy, but I'm editing this review because it deserves a more clear description so that it really is helpful. I have never written a review for a game but this game inspired me to do so. I duely appoint this game to be the most likely game to prepare you for death and also a great way to prepare for Dark Souls II (and happy fun elation too! Maybe! hmm, maybe might be a slight exaggeration). Newcomers to the franchise shouldn't be too discouraged, the game won't hold your hand, and you'll improve drastically because of it. And you won't have a very hard time progressing through the game as a result of not knowing what to do next, wherever you go you can progress and you'll navigate the main storyline without too much difficulty.Updated 3/28/2014. This review welcomes suggestions and criticism so that it can be improved.			"

												Dark Souls One is my most beloved game of all time, even beating Ultimate DOOM and Metroid Prime which were among the first and greatest games I ever played. It's a Dark Fantasty styled RPG that doesn't hold your hand through the game, hell not even the story, leaving you to fill in the blanks which created one of the biggest lore communities for a video game that's ever been made. It's easily my favorite game of all time, and is a godly title, throwing you into a dark curse world that'll tear you apart over and over and is heavily inspired by my favorite book/comic series ever made, Berserk, and if you know what Berserk is then you'll see all the inspiration and love for it in this game. While you'll need the DSFix mod to even make the game playable in terms of frame rate and bugs, and another mod for the online connection and PVP to even be close to stable, it's the greatest game I've ever played. The huge variety of enemies, the level design, the soundtrack, the characters, the lore, the story, everything besides the games sadly unstable fps and bugginess is damn near perfect, and is one of the very, very few games I'd ever give a 10/10 rating too (There's only 6 others out of every game I've ever played) and the replayability for this game is at a high level as well, and that's not even including the still very active community in the PVP part of the game. The Souls series itself is a beautiful collection, and this is simply the greatest of all of them, and my favorite RPG I've ever played.			"

												This game is deemed ridiculously hard by the majority of the fan-base, but the difficulty of the game isn't unfair. If you don't immediately ragequit this game, you'll start to apprecciate how well-made it is. It has wonderful gameplay, awesome combat, a huge seamless world with a huge amount of weapons and items, and an incredible storyline (look up the lore on YouTube). I would give this game a 9 out of 10, only because of a few issues that were fixed in the sequel (get that too). I would definitely recommend getting this game on console or using a console controller, as the PC port of this game was not optimized for the keyboard and mouse at all.			"

												An extremely challenging game in which i so wholly enjoy. The mere basics of this game makes it challenging with unforgiving aspects such as extremely hard bosses, aggressive enemies, and fast moving damage dealers. This game as well has alot of variety including builds such as dex (dexterity) builds, builds based around miracles and your faith, strength weapons that require inhuman strength but pays that back with overwhelming damage, and builds where you just focus all of your souls into your pyromancy flame (Straight Pyromancer Build). I have played this game and i have tried most builds. They have their strengths and weaknesses from pyromancy being almost useless against smaug and his friend. To enemies who are very vulnerable to flame. I would rate this game a straight 10/10 for how challenging, fun, and its great co-op system, i am very proud of this game and can never get bored of it.

												A controller will greatly benefit your experience in this game. I also recommend the DSfix Mod. This is one of those games that feels good to beat. Winning feels like an accomplishment because the game rarely pulls its punches. The world is dangerous and filled with horrible things that want nothing more than to kill you, again and again. But almost everything in the game feels fair. I never truly found myself dieing because the game was unfair. I found myself dieing because I didn't play with a plan, because I rushed in without caution, because I became impatient. It's not a game for everyone. If you don't enjoy the taste of accomplishment that comes from wallowing in defeat you may not enjoy this game. If you don't like putting the story together yourself by collecting bits of story from exploring the world you may find the narritive lacking. If you don't care to learn about the mechanics of the combat you will hit a wall in terms of progress. In terms of cost to enjoyment ratio, it's a great deal. I believe my first playthrough took ~60-70 hours.			"

												This game feels EXACTLY like War of the Roses, another game that takes place in a similar medieval setting with realistic physics (meaning the jumps aren't like those videogames where you can literally jump higher than your own height etc) You roll and you feel the weight of your body as your armor smashes into the stone floor of some underground ruins. You could even say it is the RPG version of that game, since that game is only for purely PVP.This also reminds me alot of Monster Hunter, with all the big boss battles etc. Expect epic Hydra and Dragon fights. The game becomes easier by several folds if you have a party, so try to do some side line soloing too if you wish to truly enjoy the intended difficulty of the game. I tend to let my friends walk ahead of me in our parties, so that they may also enjoy the fun of being tricked into chasing a naked zombie and then realizing it was a bait to an ambush, and that all too famous black knight one-hit-kill with his huge sword as soon as my friend climbs unsuspectingly to the top of the tower stairs and pops his head up seconds before it gets split into two.

												I'm not that far yet.  But this is the most involved I've been in a video game in years.  Dark Souls recreates this certain mystery that games used to give me when I was a kid.  I feel compelled to explore everywhere and figure out things for myself, because that is the only way you can play the game.  You have little to nothing except your willpower to move forward.  Yes, the game is very hard.  But if you get used to the combat system, you feel compelled to master it.  I have only put 12 hours into this game so far, and I've only rung the first bell (not very far).  This game is worth the $29.99.  I mean, I got it on sale, but it is worth any price.  In a nutshell, play it.			"

												This is probably one of the most aptly named games I've ever played - you will die. You will swear, you'll shout and wake your neighbours, you may even break your controller (really do follow the store page advice, a gamepad is really the only way this game can be played). I bought this game having heard how challenging it was - I gave up after getting destroyed repeatedly by the tutorial boss!!! But several months later, as the buzz for Dark Souls II began to grow, I gave it another go. And it was still brutally tough.  However as may have said before, it's (mostly) fair. This game strikes an amazing balance that means conquering each area, taking out every enemy, earning each piece of equipment, is HUGELY satisfying. Seriously, the immense satisfaction derived from beating a tough boss in this game is near unbeaten by anything I've ever played. And if ever the going gets too tough, there's no shame in turning to the internet for advice, because that alone won't get you through, the best it can do is steer you in the right direction.   Adding to this, it has a great combat system, each weapon has it's own unique move set, each move recorded in motion capture to make it feel smooth. Because of this you grow a much more natural preference to weapons you feel more comfortable with, not just the regular ""Imma get the hardest hitting motherf**ker and stick with it"". I never had much use for magic myself in the game, it has however appeared very effective from what I've seen other players do.    That does bring me to a minor problem howerver - other players. I played this just before Dark Souls II came out, so the player base had emptied by then, therefore most of the time I was alone save a few NPC buddies the game grants you if you need some help (you can summon the spirits of other people you meet on your journey to help with bosses in exchange for the boss being a little tougher). The thing is though next to nobody seemed to be around to be summoned, nor did anyone ever summon me for help at any point in the game save a couple of rare occasions. It's a very cool mechanic, and is well used in the sequel, but I guess if you don't know any better you don't really miss it - and it makes it all the more fun in Dark Souls II. Also, people often mention the terrible performance of the game on PC, but that's long since been fixed through modders which make it playable, not really an  issu unless you ""MUST"" play all your games at 60fps, as I believe the fix makes the game run fine but at 30fps (basically console level)   Other than that, and the difficulty that may not be to everyone's taste, this is an outstanding challenge to play, and if you can work it out (or just watch the lore videos on Youtube) it has a fascinating story, that can add genuine emotion to some battles as you discover how the land of Lordran became so twisted.

												Don't let my ""4"" hours in this game fool you. I played this for upwards 300-400 hours back when I used to play on consoles, and another 200 or so hours on PC before it even came to Steam, so I can say without a doubt, that this flawed masterpiece is my favorite video game of all time. I may have been introduced to the series thanks to Demon's Souls (I even have many more hours logged into that game as well), but I feel like this is where From really ""got"" where to go. Demon's Souls was incredible, but also somewhat of a mess, in that it didn't really know where it wanted to be as a game. It tried to create backstory and lore, but fell short in comparison. The PVP, while great (This is where I spent most of my time with it), played a much smaller part. The bosses, while epic, weren't terribly intricate or creative (Dragon God? Cool boss idea, but super generic). Dark Souls 2, another game I love to death, is very much a mess. It tries far to hard to be the best of Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls, but falls short, capturing very few, *real* Souls moments. It's Lore is a massive disappointment compared to the first Dark Souls, and the game itself is just a mash of zones thrown together (Go into a windmill, end up in a lava-surrounded castle? Or when you go through Aldia's Keep, you end up taking a tall elevator and end up in the Dragon Aerie? Where the hell did that come from? Outside of Aldia's Keep looks NOTHING like where you suddenly end up. There are no massive spires all throughout the area around Aldia's Keep, then suddenly there are? Meh. Whatever.) Now, Dark Souls 2 does shine in one key area; the most important in fact. The GAMEPLAY. This is where Dark Souls 2 succeeds and allows me to forgive all of its shortcomings. The combat is slick, the PVP is addicting and rewarding, and the bosses/enemy designs are creative and fun to fight.Dark Souls 3 is now the big deal in the Souls universe, and while it is currently my most enjoyed game as of the last couple of years, and a better Souls game than Dark Souls 2, I can't really talk about what makes it as special as it is without first talking about the game that makes this series itself what it is...Dark Souls. Not 2, not 3, not even Demon's Souls (In my opinion, and I still love the hell out of that game). Just Dark Souls. Where to even begin? This game is HUGE, yet very compact. It nails level design, weapons/armor, enemies/bosses, and the lore especially. I'm still to this day, trying to uncover its secrets, and speculating on all manner of things within this universe. Odds are, the developers themselves don't even know the answers to a lot of my questions, but you know what? I'm fine with that. Sometimes it's better to be able to craft my own theories and formulate my own opinions about certain characters or places based off of what I *think* is true or untrue about them. It makes it feel like I'm played a gigantic, epic campaign in D&D, and I love every moment of it. Sure Dark Souls 3 is a better game from a gameplay and storytelling (but not story itself) prespective, and it's surely the game I would suggest someone play if they wanted to get into the series, as it's a much better representation of how great the series is for this modern age of gaming, there is no denying that Dark Souls 1 is where the true heart of the series lies.

												Dark Souls Prepare to Die edition is one of the best games you will have the pleasure to suffer to play it. The game places you at the end of the age of fire, in which the great lords of Lordran have begun to fade in power. You, the undead, has begun his/her journey in the Undead Asylum, were you are taught the basics of combat and given your starting equipment. You are able to choose from various different classes going from warrior to deprived (meaning with only a wooden shield and a wooden club.)The game centers around exploration and combat which is very easy to learn and apply in the different situations. You must quickly learn that you arent the superpowered heroe that you are in most other games. You can die from the most basic of enemies, and you will have to get used to this. You will die. A lot. Four things you must have to enjoy this game: Persistence, patience, perseverance and stubbornness.Controller smashing fun!! Ulcer bringing happiness!! Spincter clenching moments!! And much more can be yours for the low, low price of your sanity!!Some of the best boss fights I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing, along with solid combat and a deep system of blocking, evasion, armour, magic, and pyromacy which forces you to think ahead of the fights or be cursed to live them over and over and over again. The name says it all: Prepare to die.The story isnt told in narration or is blasted into your face like other games. The rich and deep lore from the history and NPCs is told mostly by item descriptions and sometimes in dialog and actions of these NPCsThe music is amazing. Some of the boss fights will be accompanied by some of the most beautifully crafted and immersive music that will stay with you even after you finish the game.Pros: Story, gameplay, replayability is basically infinite, weapon variety, class variety, musicCons: You will get frustrated at the beginning as you learn the gameplay and weapon varietiesgit gud 9/10Priscilla best waifu			"

												Dark Souls 1 is not an easy game, but it also isn't a game that tries to be unfair. DS1 is a game that rewards patience, curiosity, and allows the player to go through the game how they wish. The tutorial is optional, the story is optional, talking to NPCs is 90% optional, however, ignoring these optional things will make the first play through for a virgin Souls player extremely confusing and feel like this game has nothing to offer other than death.It is true that death plays an important role in the game as both a mechanic as well as part of the plot of the story. The player that will enjoy this game is one that not only enjoys a challenge, but also one that isn't afraid to fail. You will die. You will lose your Souls aka experience more than once. Each time is a chance to learn more and and grow as a Souls player and a gamer in general. I can't recommend this game enough. It has one of the best stories and game designs I have had the privilege to enjoy. You will miss a lot your first play through, but I still encourage people to play without help the first time. Talk to NPCs, read item descriptions, get lost, die, learn. But don't you dare go hollow.			"

												I'll be the first (or one of the first) to admit that the game is not without its flaws; the port has some issues, ranging from some wonky collisions right down to stuff that not only doesn't make sense, but can't be reproduced even if you try.But despite all of that, it's a solid piece of work and easily one of my favourite games on any platform. It takes a mechanic that would usually be seen as absolute BS (trial and error gaming) and turns the negatives on their head - you're rewarded for taking things slowly and trying out different ways of attacking problems. The game has its own rules and doesn't break them - just like you, the enemies you face can't endlessly spam attacks and just like you their guard will break if you hit it enough times. EVERYTHING you meet operates within the game's constraints, and so if you take a methodical approach, there's pretty-much NOTHING in there that you can't beat in a one-on-one fight.The RPG mechanic of ""Linear Warrior, Quadratic Wizard"" doesn't apply - while using magic is more or less the closest thing the game has to an easy mode, if you don't like using pyromancy, sorceries, or miracles, you can dump a few levels in your physical stats and start beating the snot out of things with a greatsword to see if that tickles your fancy. The reverse also applies - if having to get within bad-breath range of the undead cast is getting you down, scratch up a couple of levels in Faith or Intelligence, work on Attunement to open up some spell slots, and start nuking things.The most important thing to come to terms with is not that you will die frequently (and believe me, you will die frequently, especially if you're as bad at the game as I am), it is that you're not playing for the grinding hours of frustration and swearing at your screen; play for the relief and joy of finally finding the key to a situation and pushing through it.

												People will say you should play Dark Souls because it is like TEH HAREDST GAM EVA!!!111Or avoid it because it is punishingly hard.My recommendation is to ignore all those claims about the difficulty, the game is just retro-difficult and actually has quite a good challenge curve once you pass the 2-3 first bosses for the first time.And you should play Dark Souls because it is a great game. The level design is superb, as you explore through twisting paths, switching floors and opening shortcuts to where you were hours ago. The graphics are well designed (but dated) and the sound design is great. There will be moments you will be straining to hear if those footsteps get closer to you.As for the gameplay, the combat in Dark Souls is the star. This is an action RPG and it has a very responsive and precise combat system, perhaps a bit too gamey (with the occasional hitbox/animation exploit)  but once you get the hang of the game it becomes very satisfying. Control-wise, the keyboard setup is a bit awkward and the game is better played with a controller.The port is decent but poor, with too few options, some mods are almost required to enjoy.Oh, and about the difficulty: you will die. A lot. But dying is not losing, you are undead and you instantly respawn, making dying part of the game. There will be times you will kamikaze to get an item or off an annoying non-respawning enemy, making it an effective tactic. And the game will remain constantly challenging, forcing you to replay each and every segment of it till you learn how to handle it, then it will through you another, much different challenge. Most of the times the difficulty is fair, but there are some cheap bossfights (I am looking at you, stray assylum demon) and the fabled obscurity about game mechanincs that can end up becoming frustrating (unless you read a walkthrough and lose some of the fun exploring the game - but noone is perfect).Overall, a great game everybody must play, assuming (s)he can take the time and effort to master it - it is a highly satisfying experience			"

												Truely you must prepare to die... Alot.Dark Souls is the follow-up / spirtual successor to Demon's Souls which is essentially the same thing,the main difference that being it finally became a PC and Xbox title. Dark Souls places you in the world of Lordran land of lords as the Chosen Undead the supposed decendent of the easily forgotten Furtive Pygmy (or Manus if you believe the theory). You may either rekindle the flame for the new Age Of Fire, or walk away to become the Dark Lord for the Age Of Man as the Furtive Pygmy desired to have.This port is mediocre in quailty and could've easily been improved severely ( BlightTown, 30fps lock, non 1080p graphics, and crappy UI I mean it still uses the Xbox Buttons for prompts. ),Nontheless it defintely holds up to it's other more superior ports given that it still plays the same way, with the samepainful and scary invasion, and it's noted hard difficulty.This game is known for it's insane difficulty, however it really although harder than most games this kind of skill is easily accumulated over gameplay hours. One hour you can't fight a hollow, the next you just kill Seath The Scaleless.Also if you thought the challenges ended by beating the game, there is New Game + (up to 6) which essentially increases difficulty, and trust me it will make things very interesting, that first Taurus Demon might not be as easy as a few leap jabs now is it? Once you get used to getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked a couple hundred times you will almost never go back to a RPG / Game that makes you a god.(Thanks for user Gezo for mentioning this, mods are definitely suggested, DSfix is very notable for being essential on PC)			"

												You'll either love it, and by love it i mean it will probably be one of the better games you've ever played and it might give you a hard time in finding satisfaction in another game for some time. On the contrary, some people don't see its greatness, some perhaps because they give up and others just might not, as i said, see its greatness . The game creates a certain atmosphere thats hard to come by in any other game. The npcs/ characters has a sort of mysterious feeling about them and the areas likewise. The bossbattles and their soundtracks are unforgettable. Overall i cant recommend this game enough but of course this is the words of someone that simply loves dark souls so make of this what you want. The game is often on sale but even at full price it's a must buy.			"

												I would describe myself as very new to Dark Souls having not played any of the sequels yet either. With almost 80 hours into DS:PTDE I can say that this would already make it into my top 10 easily.This game can be as deep or superficial as you like depending on your preference and time available to you. On the surface it is a difficult and challenging explorative action game with a decent fighting system that requires patience and strategy, and an intriguing world that provides a looming, fantastical backdrop. Dig deeper and you find that every NPC has a deep backstory and the world is dark and full of a sense of disparing melancholia that speaks thoughout the entire narrative. The level design is among the best I've have seen in recent years as every part of the world feels connected and is cleverly and thoughtfully conceived. The first playthrough (which I still have not completed by this point btw) makes this even more rewarding as you discover how the areas are linked to one another.If you've been thinking about giving the Dark Souls a try the answer is yes and the first one is - as you'd expect - an excellent place to start.*Xbox Controller (or steam pad) recommended!

												A really unique experience that I'd recommend to anyone with a controller to play it with. Don't let anyone kid you: even with the various fixes out there, this game will never play well with a mouse and keyboard. Any USB controller with 2 sets of shoulder buttons can be made to work with Dark Souls.DSfix is also pretty essential. The game looks like♥♥♥♥♥without it, and it helps fix some of performance issues.It's as difficult or as easy as you make it, but don't look up anything on the internet unless you absolutely must; the magic of the first playthrough is overcoming the game's obstacles by yourself. Don't worry about specific builds, heavy PvP, etc. until afterwards.			"

												(Before reading the following scenario, be aware that the last paragraph is about how awesome this game is and you should get it)_______________________________________________After spending 10-30 minutes crafting a unique character to portray your identity, you find yourself already dead at the beginning of the game, or undead so to speak. This is probably for the best, because if you were to start alive, the game would be more than willing to kill you as many times as it needs to until you've become a bloody conglamerate of what appears to be flesh.For the first 40 hours of gameplay, you are given these instructions; ring two bells. Where? How? Why? Well if it told you, where would the fun be? Instead of having a fluffy NPC tell you ""Oh Bob, you should probably turn around and head to undead burg"" they take the obviously more effective approach and rather place a prowling demon with 2000 health or a lake of lava containing 7 bosses to kill you, implying the message in your head ""Hm... I'm gonna go somewhere else!"" Bliighttoown iis graaphiic iinteensiivee aand wiill sloow doown thee fraameeraatees oof thee feeeeblee coompuuteereed.......... Fraameeraatee..... Sloowiing.....

Okay we're at the top alive you're good. Nevermind a knight just stabbed your heart you're dead.If you're new, I can assure you, you should not fight ghosts or skeletons until you have the Lordvessel, and the forest is really just sorta there for you to do whenever you don't die when you try to get in. Oh right, did I mention you'll die a lot? I mean, Prepare To Die Edition, you've been warned. You will lose a lot of souls. It happens. I lost 126,000 once. I didn't care, 'cause Dark Souls bro, duh. Knight Solaire is your friend to assist you in some jolly cooperation for bosses if you're human. Remember that.PRAIIIISE THE SUUUUN!!!-*Cough* ahem, I mean, This game is amazing.

												All arguments about whether or not video games are art cast aside, Dark Souls might aptly be called a masterpiece. The game is an aesthetic triumph in its use of light, sound, and setting to create a distinctive atmosphere, and more importantly, it's fun. Dark Souls strikes a great balance of challenge, reward, and utter bull♥♥♥♥♥♥to create an experience that is simultaneously harrowing and satisfying. Is it the perfect game? Not by a long shot. It's the laziest port to PC I've seen since Saint's Row 2 (although this can be fixed with a fanmade patch), and there are some gravely serious weapon balance issues that are most apparent in player versus player interactions. The game's difficulty is also vastly overstated both by its fans and its detractors, the product of a generation that sucks at video games being confronted at last with a game that refuses to hold the player's hand. Ultimately, though, Dark Souls is all about the journey. It's about overcoming relentless enemies, ceaseless problems, and suffering without end. The presentation, as a whole, greatly overshadows the myriad shortcomings in design.			"

												This is an amazing game, storywise, gameplay, overall. I've had so much fun playing this enthralling story. Yet there is one thing about it. Something that really almost ruined the game for me. Games for Windows LIVE. I had to spend about 15 minutes  dealing with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t before I actually got into the game. I had to verify my email here, download this, reset that, just an infuriating process. Then everytime i started after that I had to wait the crap to load and log in. Overall great game, but what is the point of Games for Windows, if the game is already on Steam?			"

About The GameDark Souls tells the story of your hero trying to save an intriguing world which, by every possible metric, fell long ago. Abominations make their homes in the forgotten nooks of a lost civilisation. A handful of enigmatic survivors are all that's left, but you're as free to talk to them as kill them, and they're as liable to help you as to lie. Best of all, the game literally kills you off somewhere between character creation and the first cut-scene. Above all, Dark Souls seems to thrill at escaping expectations.Generaly in Dark Souls you're not completing levels, or even doubling back in the Metroidvania style. You're exploring, taking step after nervous step through a foul wonderland that oscillates between great cruelty, and moments of sweet relief. Its great achievement is in not feeling like a game world at all, much as Minecraft didn't, and it's a similar joy to explore. This simply feels like a place where you really, really shouldn't be, where every step is heavy with dread.Pure Controlsll of this survives, totally intact, in the PC port, with a single caveat - you must own a Xbox 360 pad, or suitable equivalent.The mouse and keyboard controls in the Prepare to Die edition are a war crime. Losing the gentle acceleration of analog movement would have been bad enough, but the mouse doesn't control the camera so much as wrestle it around on a rubber leash. Meanwhile, the GUI's adaption to the keyboard is just awkward. All told, you could be playing on an emulator. If you don't own a pad but somehow end up with Dark Souls running on your PC, remove the power cable from the back with a barge pole.But if you do own a pad, and quickly grab this 80Kb fan hotpix, which unlocks the game's resolution from 1024x720, you'll be able to enjoy the definitive edition of Dark Souls until the Artorias of the Abyss DLC arrives for consoles this winter. That content's packed in the PC version for free, and we're pleased to announce that it's... fine. It's just fine.Overall i definitely reccomend buying this game if you own a XBOX 360 Controller !9.2/10 "

												This game surprises with so many never before seen ideas in my gaming lifetime. Something I love most is that you really need to learn how to navigate and control your character, no invisible walls to keep you from diving off the edge into that lovely sunset, nope. You take a bad step and it's pahnkake(unenforceable copyright pending) status for you. And surprisingly a stroll across a small ledge over a deep chasm gives a great adrenaline rush and satisfaction when you succeed in defeating a ledge boss, also being wary of elevator bosses is necessary too. If you block or parry someones attack, you'd better time it right, because it takes perfect timing. However you will be surprised at how proficient you can become at anticipating peoples attacks with practice, and you can use regular computer controlled enemies for that. And if you parry them, it leaves them open for a riposte (meaning an undefended attack that allows for a great finishing attack) which in most cases is an insta-kill, or at least a huge hit. And the killing blow for backstabs and riposte' are always fantastic to watch.The game is for a majority of the time a Single Player experience but has an integrated PvP system divided into ""worlds"" or ""dimensions"" if you will, meaning that people can invade your world to kill you, or join your world as a cooperative help to make difficult area's less punishing and more enjoyable, but not easy. Note that the age of the game and it's use of Games For Windows Live have allowed for somewhat of a cheating infestation, it doesn't by any means make the game unplayable though.I haven't before gone into details because I'm really just that lazy, but I'm editing this review because it deserves a more clear description so that it really is helpful. I have never written a review for a game but this game inspired me to do so. I duely appoint this game to be the most likely game to prepare you for death and also a great way to prepare for Dark Souls II (and happy fun elation too! Maybe! hmm, maybe might be a slight exaggeration). Newcomers to the franchise shouldn't be too discouraged, the game won't hold your hand, and you'll improve drastically because of it. And you won't have a very hard time progressing through the game as a result of not knowing what to do next, wherever you go you can progress and you'll navigate the main storyline without too much difficulty.Updated 3/28/2014. This review welcomes suggestions and criticism so that it can be improved.			"

												Dark SoulsPrepare To Die EditionGenre : Action-RPGRating: 10/10Comment : It's the best game I've ever played. It deserved a better pc port'Dark Souls' is a complex dark fantasy action role-playing game that is played from a third person perspective. It has a direct combat system similar to games like the 'Zelda' series. Unlike those it comes with a multiplayer feature: You can cooperatively take on bosses or fight other players to the death. The game is challenging and very rewarding once you achieve something. There are tons of secrets to discover be it gamplay- or story-wise. All these things add up to a high replay value.In my humble opinion 'Dark Souls' is a masterpiece and should be seen as a milestone of videogame history. Edit : Now that Dark Souls works with steamworks I played the game again. Arriving at the 'Firelink Shrine' felt like coming home and I realized that Dark Souls is my all time favourite game. So I changed the rating from 9,5 to 10 although the game still has its technical issues.			"

												Dark Souls is brutally hard and it doesn't hold your hand. Everything (with the exception of some NPCs) is out to get you. That's why I love it so much.You'll die a thousand deaths and it will be painful. But you will also learn from your deaths. Each one of them will teach you a valuable lesson. Remember to experiment! Try different approaches!Do yourself a favor and don't read/watch any walkthroughs during your first playthrough, unless you really get stuck and need some direction. It is a way more satisfying to overcome the obstacles and find new places all by yourself.			"

												Dark Souls is a truly unforgettable gaming experience. Known for its difficulty, it really isn't TOO difficult once you get used to the mechanics. There are a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and three magic styles, each one having a different feel. The story, while seeming shallow at first, has quite a bit of depth if you are willing to look for it. And after all is said and done, there's still the multiplayer...EDIT: Nominated for Test of Time.			"

												It's hard to put into words why I like Dark Souls so much. Well let me just say that you're going to need the patience of a saint, fast reflexes, and the ability to adapt to any situation at any given time if you want to get through this game in it's entirety. Now moving on to the gameplay itself, it's just wonderful. To put it simply, melee combat is the base of this game. You posess a wide variety of swords, bows, sheilds, and magic to defeat the many deadly mobs of enemies that you'll meet in the game. There are many game mechanics that make this game different from other melee focused games, but for now, let's just start with the basics. For starters, there are many ways you can swing and control your weapon. You can attack in light basic swings, or you can go for more damaging and slower attacks. Either way, you'll need to figure out which set of attacks is needed for the current situation. Then there is the ability to parry and riposte. Sure, you can sit there and swing your sword mindlessly, which will most likely get you killed, or you can parry your foes attack, leaving them wide open for a riposte, or counter attack, dealing massive critical damage. Another game mechanic that changes up the playstyle of the game, is the ability to dodge. Sure it doesn't sound so impressive at first, but Dark Souls puts a lot of emphasis into dodging. You could just go through the entire game with a sheild, (wut r u casul m8?) but before you know it, enemies are becoming so strong, that they're able to blast through your sheild like it's nothing. That's where dodging becomes essential. You have the ability to roll through enemies attacks thanks to the use of invincibility frames. Dodging takes a considerable amount of skill, timing, and practice and is one of the game mechanics that really challenges your ability to memorize attack patterns and really take into account how easy it is to screw up and die, which is why I think it's a mechanic that really spices up things in Dark Souls. Anyway these mechanics and so much more really add to why this game's combat is so rewarding and satisfying. Imagine just dying over and over to a boss that you're trying so hard to kill. Then you start to memorize his attack patterns, the way he swings his weapon, how he swings his weapon, how he telegraphs his attacks. You then start dodging all his attacks flawlessly, using patterns of light and heavy swings to take him down with each dodge. The feeling of absolute victory and triumph is what will keep you wanting more. With that being said, I will move on to the environment and world itself. Dark Souls does not have a very linear path or objective, in fact, it encourages you to go in different paths and learn what the objective is for yourself. The game will not hold your hand, and if you die, then that's on you. All the mistakes and deaths are made by you and created by you, so don't blame the game if you're sucking. The most reasonable solution is to just git gud and stop being a casul scrub. Honestly, the environment really supports the vibe of complete loneliness and helplessness. You won't be having much social interactions in this game, save for a few NPC's and most of the time your only company is going to be the mobs of enemies around you. Overall, Dark Souls is a very unforgiving experience that will only get worse with your impatience and lack of skill and know how. If you manage to get past all that, however, and actually learn from your mistakes and manage to not get fed up with the amounts of death and stress you'll have to deal with, then it becomes one of the most memorable and rewaring experiences you could ever have in gaming, ever.

It has great characters, music, bosses, areas, a very interesting story and way to tell it and, best of all, fantastic combat. The combat is simple yet complicated, easy to learn and hard to master, and it is VERY addictive. I have finished this game start to finish 17 times so far (9 on 360, 6 on PS3 and twice on PC) and every once in a while I'll still play it for some time, and that is all due to the brilliant combat that provides endless hours of fun.If you're in for a challenge, I highly recommend this game. My one advice is: Don't give up and be prepared to die. Death is not failure in Dark Souls, it is knowledge. Learn from each death and keep going.			"

												I guess I might as well write one of these after 100%-ing the game finally. Did not know that I was gonna end up doing this, considering that when I first played the game, I hated it (purely out of my incredible bad-ness). But after playing a lot more, over several different playthroughs and weapon usage (my personal favorite was squashing everyone with the Zweihander), I gained a lot more respect for the game.I don't really know what to say that the many other reviews haven't already said, honestly. The story/lore/whatever is well constructed (even though I don't really care about it), the gameplay is very solid (even though backstabs are incredibly silly), the bosses are varied and interesting (except for the Lost Izalith bosses and having to fight the Stray Demon 3 times), and the immense replayability speaks for itself with the large amount of weapons and self-imposed restrictions you can put on yourself. Although trying to 100% it is a huge trial, since at BARE MINIMUM you have to go to NG+2 (screw you Sif!), so fighting a handful of the bosses with even more HP on NG+1 can be really tedious. If there's one problem I have, it's that NG+ is just one of those ""amp up the enemy stats"" difficulty modifiers that I'm not a huge fan of. But that's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things.So good on you Dark Souls, despite being a not-so-great port on your own (seriously, get DSFix), you have a ton of content and quality for most people to be satisfied with.

												This is probably one of the most aptly named games I've ever played - you will die. You will swear, you'll shout and wake your neighbours, you may even break your controller (really do follow the store page advice, a gamepad is really the only way this game can be played). I bought this game having heard how challenging it was - I gave up after getting destroyed repeatedly by the tutorial boss!!! But several months later, as the buzz for Dark Souls II began to grow, I gave it another go. And it was still brutally tough.  However as may have said before, it's (mostly) fair. This game strikes an amazing balance that means conquering each area, taking out every enemy, earning each piece of equipment, is HUGELY satisfying. Seriously, the immense satisfaction derived from beating a tough boss in this game is near unbeaten by anything I've ever played. And if ever the going gets too tough, there's no shame in turning to the internet for advice, because that alone won't get you through, the best it can do is steer you in the right direction.   Adding to this, it has a great combat system, each weapon has it's own unique move set, each move recorded in motion capture to make it feel smooth. Because of this you grow a much more natural preference to weapons you feel more comfortable with, not just the regular ""Imma get the hardest hitting motherf**ker and stick with it"". I never had much use for magic myself in the game, it has however appeared very effective from what I've seen other players do.    That does bring me to a minor problem howerver - other players. I played this just before Dark Souls II came out, so the player base had emptied by then, therefore most of the time I was alone save a few NPC buddies the game grants you if you need some help (you can summon the spirits of other people you meet on your journey to help with bosses in exchange for the boss being a little tougher). The thing is though next to nobody seemed to be around to be summoned, nor did anyone ever summon me for help at any point in the game save a couple of rare occasions. It's a very cool mechanic, and is well used in the sequel, but I guess if you don't know any better you don't really miss it - and it makes it all the more fun in Dark Souls II. Also, people often mention the terrible performance of the game on PC, but that's long since been fixed through modders which make it playable, not really an  issu unless you ""MUST"" play all your games at 60fps, as I believe the fix makes the game run fine but at 30fps (basically console level)   Other than that, and the difficulty that may not be to everyone's taste, this is an outstanding challenge to play, and if you can work it out (or just watch the lore videos on Youtube) it has a fascinating story, that can add genuine emotion to some battles as you discover how the land of Lordran became so twisted.

												Don't let my ""4"" hours in this game fool you. I played this for upwards 300-400 hours back when I used to play on consoles, and another 200 or so hours on PC before it even came to Steam, so I can say without a doubt, that this flawed masterpiece is my favorite video game of all time. I may have been introduced to the series thanks to Demon's Souls (I even have many more hours logged into that game as well), but I feel like this is where From really ""got"" where to go. Demon's Souls was incredible, but also somewhat of a mess, in that it didn't really know where it wanted to be as a game. It tried to create backstory and lore, but fell short in comparison. The PVP, while great (This is where I spent most of my time with it), played a much smaller part. The bosses, while epic, weren't terribly intricate or creative (Dragon God? Cool boss idea, but super generic). Dark Souls 2, another game I love to death, is very much a mess. It tries far to hard to be the best of Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls, but falls short, capturing very few, *real* Souls moments. It's Lore is a massive disappointment compared to the first Dark Souls, and the game itself is just a mash of zones thrown together (Go into a windmill, end up in a lava-surrounded castle? Or when you go through Aldia's Keep, you end up taking a tall elevator and end up in the Dragon Aerie? Where the hell did that come from? Outside of Aldia's Keep looks NOTHING like where you suddenly end up. There are no massive spires all throughout the area around Aldia's Keep, then suddenly there are? Meh. Whatever.) Now, Dark Souls 2 does shine in one key area; the most important in fact. The GAMEPLAY. This is where Dark Souls 2 succeeds and allows me to forgive all of its shortcomings. The combat is slick, the PVP is addicting and rewarding, and the bosses/enemy designs are creative and fun to fight.Dark Souls 3 is now the big deal in the Souls universe, and while it is currently my most enjoyed game as of the last couple of years, and a better Souls game than Dark Souls 2, I can't really talk about what makes it as special as it is without first talking about the game that makes this series itself what it is...Dark Souls. Not 2, not 3, not even Demon's Souls (In my opinion, and I still love the hell out of that game). Just Dark Souls. Where to even begin? This game is HUGE, yet very compact. It nails level design, weapons/armor, enemies/bosses, and the lore especially. I'm still to this day, trying to uncover its secrets, and speculating on all manner of things within this universe. Odds are, the developers themselves don't even know the answers to a lot of my questions, but you know what? I'm fine with that. Sometimes it's better to be able to craft my own theories and formulate my own opinions about certain characters or places based off of what I *think* is true or untrue about them. It makes it feel like I'm played a gigantic, epic campaign in D&D, and I love every moment of it. Sure Dark Souls 3 is a better game from a gameplay and storytelling (but not story itself) prespective, and it's surely the game I would suggest someone play if they wanted to get into the series, as it's a much better representation of how great the series is for this modern age of gaming, there is no denying that Dark Souls 1 is where the true heart of the series lies.

												I have played through the entire game on PS3 and loved it, I Havent played much of the PC version online but its still a great game and I have personally enjoyed it very much. There are challenging enemies, mysterious envionments and powerful weapons to keep the gameplay fresh. It does take patience to overcome the bosses but when you take one down it is very satisfying. You can then take the soul obtained from bosses and make powerful weapons! FUN!			"

												DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Cry Edition, like someone called it, i totally agree with this name cause i was close to cry many times, specially at beginning...Another way i would like to call it is DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Fall Edition or shorter, Pitfalls, yes, because i'm pretty sure i've died much more times by falling in some dark pit than killed by enemies/Bosses.....What is good so in this game ? Let's try to find it out...The story ? It's good but not so good to be able to say it's epic, it's interesting and capture your attention so that you want to know what will happens afterward, but at the end it's not so special.What is really good in this game is the graphic art, the enemies and bosses are very well painted, loved them, the combat system is at beginning very complicated but once you manage to master it it's well rewarding.I never had one single crash in all the time i spent over this game so we can say that devs did a good job about that..So overall we can say that this is a GOOD game but then, why we are not going to give to it a 100% ? Let's see which are the factors that forced me to cut points on the road.....-4 points for the insane difficulty of the game, at beginning, a new player find himself in a very hostile world, enemies are from the very first minutes very strong for an unprepared adventurer and the first bosses you'll meet will challenge your skills, patience and perseverance at the limits, so much that i fear that many players would quit this game before being able to kill the first 2 bosses, killed the second, one can take a little breath and recover a bit of hope.....The ones who will not surrender and will continue will face their worst nightmares in Anor Londo, a place with a very difficult point to pass and, after that, they'll have to face what in my opinion is the most difficult boss of the whole game, a strange decision  by the devs to put a such fight in the first 35%-40% of the game, instead of leaving it for the last boss like many other games do.....-2 points for the fact that this game not tell you anything on what to do, i had to read tons of wikia game pages to learn everything i needed otherwise probably i would have missed most important things.-2 point for the targeting system and autoswitching camera, basically, if you have only one enemy in front of you, all fine, but if there are at least 2 or more, once you taget lock one, the camera will move automatically between them all making your life a nightmare, cause, will happens that you'll give your shoulders to one of them who will backstab you or you'll end falling down to death while the enemy jump in a dangerous direction...I would have totally preferred if, once i target lock one enemy, that would have been the only one enemy targeted and not all together...:(-1 point for the terrible interface of the PC port, it has a mouse cursor wandering for your screen and you can't do anything to get rid of that, altough exist an external software that fix this, being a purist i generally refuse to install external software and like to play games like they're offered by the software house, so a minor bug for many but i can't forgive devs for not having fixed this one.-1 point for the really too many zones where you risk to fall to death, come on devs, this is a RPG, not a platform.....-1 point for the way the coop/multiplayer is implemented in this game, let's talk a little about it....In this game you can wander as a ghoul (not human) and this way your single player experience will never be broken by other players, you'll be fine, but.....There is some points n this game where is better (or much better) being in human form, so, you will be able to return a normal human if you desire do so, but, once human, you'll be vulnerable to invasions that simply are the other players who will be able to enter in your world and attack you and beware, this can happens in any zone you are and in any moment, this means that if you're doing delicate things and fighting some dangerous enemies, you can be invaded and you'll be forced to fight TOGETHER the enemies you're already fighting and the player ho invaded you, specially the first times, this will most likely end up in your death.....Multiplayer can also be useful to defeat Bosses with other players but the mechanics are made this way, you can leave a summoning sign so that other players will be able to enter in your world and help you, but only if the players are in your same range and that means, if you're level 20, that only players between level 10 and 30 will be able to assist you, this means also that if you're too low level or too high level, according of the day time or luck could happen that you'll not find any player who can assist you, so, if you have a friend you want he help you be sure he's of your same level or very close to that.In conclusion, Dark Souls is an epic game, legendary for sure, but is thinked and made not for everyone, just for the hardcore players, casual ones is better stay away from this game if they not want to feel infinite frustration and pain.My Final Score is 89 /100  "

												One of my favorite RPGs. A real man's RPG. Unforgiving and ruthless, but very rewarding. You feel a real sense of progression through the game as well, making you want to continue playing. The thing I think I like most about the game is that it sets out to be what its supposed to be. It doesn't try to be an everyones game. All in all, if you are looking for a more hardcore rpg definantly put this on your to-do list.			"

												Dark Souls One is my most beloved game of all time, even beating Ultimate DOOM and Metroid Prime which were among the first and greatest games I ever played. It's a Dark Fantasty styled RPG that doesn't hold your hand through the game, hell not even the story, leaving you to fill in the blanks which created one of the biggest lore communities for a video game that's ever been made. It's easily my favorite game of all time, and is a godly title, throwing you into a dark curse world that'll tear you apart over and over and is heavily inspired by my favorite book/comic series ever made, Berserk, and if you know what Berserk is then you'll see all the inspiration and love for it in this game. While you'll need the DSFix mod to even make the game playable in terms of frame rate and bugs, and another mod for the online connection and PVP to even be close to stable, it's the greatest game I've ever played. The huge variety of enemies, the level design, the soundtrack, the characters, the lore, the story, everything besides the games sadly unstable fps and bugginess is damn near perfect, and is one of the very, very few games I'd ever give a 10/10 rating too (There's only 6 others out of every game I've ever played) and the replayability for this game is at a high level as well, and that's not even including the still very active community in the PVP part of the game. The Souls series itself is a beautiful collection, and this is simply the greatest of all of them, and my favorite RPG I've ever played.			"

												It hurts. You press start and immediately feel ashamed for dieing so often. The grind to get your character better so you can take that one extra hit in a boss fight is a beating in itself. The plot is thin, or maybe thicker than you can imagine. The graphics make you want to keep your helmet on to hide your digusting face, that - no doubt you spent near an hour on - to get at least somewhat decent on your first playthrough. You hate yourself, I hate myself, why can't I hate this game!			"

												Dark Souls is a game that consumes every last fiber of your being, changes the way you think about games entirely and then spits you back out. With over 100 hours on the console version and currently 60+ on PC(I plan to sink a hundred or so more into this before Dark Souls II) I can easily say that this is my favorite game ever made. It is definitely the best RPG ever made and I think it can contest for best game of all time. Make sure to download DSFix and DSCFix before you play. Don't you dare go hollow.			"

												Dark Souls is a game that lets you beat up women in the game but they're not real women. Sometimes real women play female characters too but sometimes it's actually men. I play this game a lot but usually I don't beat up women except when it fits my character. I get nervous when I fight other players.There's a level with crow girls and my friend said he'd give them striped panties but he says he isn't good with drawing so he hasn't done it yet. I wish this game shipped with crow girls with striped panties maybe it's in the collector's edition (I only have the prepare to die edition).+crow girls+beat up women if it fits your character+you can turn the camera-no striped pantiesFINAL VERDICT:If you like Dark Souls, this is the game for you.

												Everything there is to say about Dark Souls has been said. If you stumble on this little review, just know that it's renowned for a reason. Deep mechanics, gameplay that never gets tiresome, endless replayability, innovative multiplayer, and a story that isn't forcefed to you. The only game I cared enough about to get all the achievements, the only game I've enjoyed enough to play through more than once, and the only game I'd recommend to anyone who likes games.My only gripe is that the PvP mechanics are so much different than the PvE mechanics. When you're ready to try and take on other players online, throw out what you learned about fighting from the computer. It's a shame because PvE has a well-defined set of rules, but PvP has an entirely different tempo and features a lot of bugs and exploits (dead angling, for instance), especially with experienced players. Don't get me wrong, it's learnable, and rewarding in its own right, but it's very different than the rest of the game.If you're just starting you should know two things about the legendary difficulty of the game. 1. Combat is unforgiving - learn the controls and the tempo (button mashers won't win at DS).  2. Game mechanics are obtuse and not explained very well in game - avoid spoilers but learn the mechanics from a wiki (at minimum, understand how poise works and how endurance/encumbrance works). You'll have a much better time. It doesn't come easy but when it does, it's more rewarding than any other game you'll play.			"

												It hurts. You press start and immediately feel ashamed for dieing so often. The grind to get your character better so you can take that one extra hit in a boss fight is a beating in itself. The plot is thin, or maybe thicker than you can imagine. The graphics make you want to keep your helmet on to hide your digusting face, that - no doubt you spent near an hour on - to get at least somewhat decent on your first playthrough.

												Everything there is to say about Dark Souls has been said. If you stumble on this little review, just know that it's renowned for a reason. Deep mechanics, gameplay that never gets tiresome, endless replayability, innovative multiplayer, and a story that isn't forcefed to you. The only game I cared enough about to get all the achievements, the only game I've enjoyed enough to play through more than once, and the only game I'd recommend to anyone who likes games.My only gripe is that the PvP mechanics are so much different than the PvE mechanics. When you're ready to try and take on other players online, throw out what you learned about fighting from the computer. It's a shame because PvE has a well-defined set of rules, but PvP has an entirely different tempo and features a lot of bugs and exploits (dead angling, for instance), especially with experienced players. Don't get me wrong, it's learnable, and rewarding in its own right, but it's very different than the rest of the game.If you're just starting you should know two things about the legendary difficulty of the game. 1. Combat is unforgiving - learn the controls and the tempo (button mashers won't win at DS).  2. Game mechanics are obtuse and not explained very well in game - avoid spoilers but learn the mechanics from a wiki (at minimum, understand how poise works and how endurance/encumbrance works). You'll have a much better time. It doesn't come easy but when it does, it's more rewarding than any other game you'll play.			"

												Dark Souls One is my most beloved game of all time, even beating Ultimate DOOM and Metroid Prime which were among the first and greatest games I ever played. It's a Dark Fantasty styled RPG that doesn't hold your hand through the game, hell not even the story, leaving you to fill in the blanks which created one of the biggest lore communities for a video game that's ever been made. It's easily my favorite game of all time, and is a godly title, throwing you into a dark curse world that'll tear you apart over and over and is heavily inspired by my favorite book/comic series ever made, Berserk, and if you know what Berserk is then you'll see all the inspiration and love for it in this game. While you'll need the DSFix mod to even make the game playable in terms of frame rate and bugs, and another mod for the online connection and PVP to even be close to stable, it's the greatest game I've ever played. The huge variety of enemies, the level design, the soundtrack, the characters, the lore, the story, everything besides the games sadly unstable fps and bugginess is damn near perfect, and is one of the very, very few games I'd ever give a 10/10 rating too (There's only 6 others out of every game I've ever played) and the replayability for this game is at a high level as well, and that's not even including the still very active community in the PVP part of the game. The Souls series itself is a beautiful collection, and this is simply the greatest of all of them, and my favorite RPG I've ever played.			"

												I decided to review this game without much hours played because I have finished this game on Xbox 360. Let's get straight off to the review.Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is a role-playing, difficult game developed by From Software (best known for their difficult games, Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Demon Souls). This game was a spiritual successor to its predecessor, Demon Souls on PS3 exclusively. You have been started off as a customised undead character, you can play as 10 starting classes. The synopsis is purely minimalistic, so you have to interpret the whole story of the game. Prepare to Die Edition includes the DLC, Artorias of the Abyss. The gameplay mechanics and combat system are simple. Combat system is what this game is known for. Controller is the essential for this game or else you will die,a lot. This game is not a gung ho fest, you need a strategy for every single enemies you encounter. Reading attack patterns, when to use the item and most likely how to use stamina effectively. Co-Op system is kind of complex because you need a specific item that your friend summons you to their world to defeat their boss at any place (Jolly Cooperation yay!). The PvP in this game is great but I keep getting destroyed by Dark Souls veterans (I suck at dueling). Downside in this game? Yes, a big one. Poor PC optimization is the issue because it locks at 30fps and keyboard and mouse controls are terrible. Thankfully, you can download the 60fps mod. But it's not only the PC port issue, sorcerer class is OP because the damage is just broken and you can defeat every boss fight even without a hitch if you know how to build a sorcerer. Also, this game is not for everyone. The game suits for anyone who wants to conquer the hardship of the game or getting better at it.Pros+10 different classes+ Replayability (New Game Plus)+ Hidden Rooms and Secrets+ Amazing atmosphere and cryptic loreCons- Horrendous PC Port- Clunky controls for keyboard and mouse users (Controller, duh)- Sorcerer class is brokenI am wrapping this review up. The great; combat, atmosphere, combat system, cryptic lore, classes. The not-so-great; PC port, clunky controls for keyboard and mouse users and sorcerer class beyond OP (it's such a stupid complaint ever from me). I am giving this game a 9 out of 10, a solid recommendation. Even though, this game is not everyone, I highly recommended for gamers who are determined to play the game.			"

												After 70 total hours of gameplay I finally managed to finish Dark Souls. I started it over several times, often getting bored after reaching a certain turning point in the story, too intimidated to face ""the big guys"". Thus the first few areas of the game became very familiar to me and I couldn't resist the temptation to aggressively wiki the rest. In certain fashion, so, I had beaten the game long before I actually beat it.I usually don't have the stamina to replay any game, sometimes playing it through once is too much. Dark Souls, however, is one that never ceases to capture my attention. I'm pretty sure everything has been said concerning its polished combat system and deep, not-straight-in-your-face story, so these points don't need too much repeating. Those, however, are exactly the points that keep inviting me back again and again. It's not too often when a game dares to be difficult but fair, deep and intricate but modest and secretive at the same. It's not lightly that I consider the Souls series one of the best franchises we've had, perhaps for all time.It's actually pretty difficult to find anything to criticize. You could of course compare Demon's Souls to Dark Souls and find something to nitpick about, or compate Dark Souls 2 to Dark Souls and find something you are unhappy with. Personally I think it's very difficult to find anything meaningful to criticize. Each game does its own thing as it sees fit and I've never seen anyone denounce any of these games as totally unplayable. For me Dark Souls acts as a first encounter with a certain type of gameplay and storytelling that is practically impossible to top anymore. After 70 hours of playing and nearly the same amount watching speedruns, lore videos, let's plays and reading the Wikis, Dark Souls has embedded itself in my consciousness perhaps irreversably. It's said that you never forget your first love and it's pretty much guaranteed in my case, with this game.			"

												Excellent game, but requires a mod to fix the horrible port. It also requires a mod to fix multiplayer and requires a mod to fix button prompts for those who don't use controllers. The story isn't that great, but people buy this game just to kill stuff and not care about the story, right? The game can be challenging at first, but you'll (probably) adapt to it in no time. I really recommend that you buy this game. It only takes 5-10 minutes to install the mods and place them in their correct place. The game, however in my opinion is not worth 20$. Buy it at 20$ if you wish, but I strongly recommend buying this on sale. It can go as low as 5$, probably even lower. Have fun invading, getting invaded, and engaging in jolly cooperation!			"

You may spend hours upon hous in the darkest pits of hell, to find a way that leads you to a familiar place from a locked door you previously saw hours ago. You wouldn't expect the world to connect like that, but it does and make sense because everything is placed and spaced out in a way that makes sense.			"

												I'll start off the review by saying that this is best action RPG I've ever played.  It easily has some of the best combat in any game I've played.  The game is at times frustratingly fun to play but also immensely rewarding when you achieve victory.  This is a game that doesn't hold your hand.  Nothing is given to you, everything has to be found and fought for.  Even going for what seems to be the simplest item can sometimes lead to death.  If you want to learn the lore you have to look for it, even a conversation with an NPC can have negative consequences if you rush through it.  If you do want some help the game has allowed for other players to leave tips/hints around the map.  It was really neat to read some of the tips and they were helpful, but they are great because they are optional, if you don't want any help/spoilers you can skip them entirely.One of the best parts about this game is the amount of character customization it offers.  You have the ability to almost fully make the charcter how you want.  Picking a starting class doesn't force you to go down a specific route or path and you have to follow a certain skill tree.  Instead you can spec your character how you want, put points into the way you want to play the game.  At the same time the combination of weapons/armour/rings/items also lets your further how you want to play.  It makes it really feel like your character and should you choose to play through multiple times your character can be completely different from a previous play through.I only have two small complaints about the game.  The first is about the camera.  At tiimes the camera was just outright frustrating with no fun attatched.  The lock on/camera system would at times ignore the enemy I looking at and pick an enemy clear across the room.  Or there was times I would try to lock on to an enemy only to have my camera just spin around and I didn't lock onto anything.  Also the lock on system seemed to be a little inconsistent in the distance it takes to lock on to some enemies.  Some enemies I could lock on clear across a room while others needed to be right in my face before I could get locked on.  It was annoying but happened so infrequently that it's not a big complaint.Only other complaint was about a particular area later in the game.  The game does a good job of punishing you vs the enemies you fight, or presents a challenge in a particular area that you can overcome with having some smart item or weapon/armour usage.  However that last area didn't seem to fit that mold and felt out of place.			"

												Pretty good. I've put over 500 hours into this game on PS3 alone and I still come back to it sometimes. A lot of variety with weapons and how you can level up your character over time, and many ways to challenge yourself when you get bored. I also recommend going into this game as blind as possible. Guides, wikis, and videos will ruin your first experience.extra thing from the future:In the past, I may have recommended the console version over this one just because of how terrible Games for Windows Live was, but thankfully, in the past year or so some brave souls from bamco and/or fromsoft decided to completely transfer the online service from GFWL to Steamworks and remove region locking, eliminating any problems I had with this version of the game. This is the definitive version of Dark Souls; even without DSfix installed.Also, you've probably already heard this if you've looked into the game at all, but you will need to use DSfix if you want to get rid of the cap on the framerate and make the game look a little prettier, but installation and configuration of the tool is relatively quick and painless in most cases.

												Although getting the game to run best requires DSfix, once you get that set up, this game is quite possibley the most important landmark of the gaming decade.Beautiful designs, interesting lore, and a lasting feel that you've seen the dying breath of a wondrous world. Solid gameplay and addictive pacing. The second half is a bit messy since the game was rushed due to deadlines, but it's still enjoyable.			"

												Excellent game, but requires a mod to fix the horrible port. It also requires a mod to fix multiplayer and requires a mod to fix button prompts for those who don't use controllers. The story isn't that great, but people buy this game just to kill stuff and not care about the story, right? The game can be challenging at first, but you'll (probably) adapt to it in no time. I really recommend that you buy this game. It only takes 5-10 minutes to install the mods and place them in their correct place. The game, however in my opinion is not worth 20$. Buy it at 20$ if you wish, but I strongly recommend buying this on sale. It can go as low as 5$, probably even lower. Have fun invading, getting invaded, and engaging in jolly cooperation!			"

												Too many modern games hold your hand while you play. Dark Souls doesn't like that fact. This game's sole purpose is to remind you that you are not an unstoppable juggernaut. Every enemy can kill you, and believe me they will try their hardest to make it happen. Each victory in this game is backed by a hundred failures, but that just makes success a hundred times sweeter. You will fight, you will lose, you will respawn, you will try again, and you will not give up. Why? Because every attempt brings you one step closer to the inevitable outcome:  you will win. Welcome to Dark Souls. Prepare to Die.			"

												In a surprising turn of events, Dark Souls puts any and all responsibility of failure on the player.Got killed by an enemy? You did something wrong.Fell into a pit? You did something wrong.Died from poison? You did something wrong.But there's no limit to how many attempts you get at making it through a hurdle. And, if you learn from every mistake, you will make it through said hurdle, every hurdle. You do not need luck, only determination and the ability to learn.The game itself is a third-person Action RPG minus most of the loot casino. There are some random drops, but it's only to get early access to specific weapons (black knight ones, iirc). You progress through an area, talk to people, fight monsters, challenge bosses, and upgrade your equipment and/or character. Some weapons will be better for some players and/or characters, but there's plenty to choose from, and most of them are good enough to see you through the game.The setting is gothic dark fantasy, reinforced by the state of ruin and/or abandonment you find most things in, and NPCs are generally a grim lot. Genuinely nice and/or jolly people are few and far between.Multiplayer is different than what you'd expect, and requires some adjustment to fully use. Player-written messages are a great feature, but be wary of ruses. You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies? Yes.Due to this being a console port, it is highly recommended to play the game with a controller. Xbox360 controller behaves flawlessly. And you'll probably want to get DSFix to help bring the game up to a more visually pleasant standard (above 30fps framerate as well as texture quality).All in all, it's a great game, and you should give it a go. Just keep trying and you'll make it through.Don't you dare go hollow.			"

												From my own experience, the real enjoyment of the game wasn't just the challenge of the game, but how dynamic the combat is and how interesting it is to see how different playstyles, weapons, spells, items, armor interact against certain enemies and players.The game does not hold you back on anything, it has a relatively fast tutorial and its areas are can be open. Although certain situations can become ""linear"", and may lack some options, the game itself shines in the fact that almost any situation is possible to complete even with the worst kind of gear, it will just take skill, and a bit of luck.I should warn the game can be incredibly vague, and that there are some gameplay aspects that are never explained (poise damage, humanity counter 'XP')Because the game was rushed, some things might feel a bit 'lacking' and there are some design issues that may show this.play cautiously, but play to die, because that's the entire point of the game.

												This game is one of my favourites for this decade. Dark Souls is a harsh, unforgiving but still such a rewarding game. So first im going to tell you the fact that you are going to die.....alot. But the feeling when you kill a boss that you've been struggling with for many hours is  incredibly satisfying. The game is meant for people who are not afraid of spending alot of time and for people that have very good nerves. I've found myself throwing my controller to the wall but I've also found myself kissing the controller when I get through a really hard area of the game. But this game isn't perfect, sometimes it takes 30-50 minutes to find yourself a co-op partner due to Dark Souls not having it's own servers for multiplayer. But for me, that's the only negative thing about this game. Also if you're planning to play on a keyboard,, it might overhelm you due to it's weird  default key-bindings. But that problem can be easily solved by re-binding the keys to whatever you desire. But after all the game is a wonderful piece of art with it's unique world and it's sometimes ridiculously hard boss fights. I can't wait for DS2!  ""Praise the Sun!"" ~|Edu|10/10			"

												Dark Souls is like a slow, strategic, punishing, survival horror hack n slash story and multiplayer hybrid game.For starters, It has engaging enemies and bosses that have interesting design. Secondly, immersive exploration and great level design as the whole world is cleverly interconnected and the shortcuts are well placed and can surprise you .To add to that, there is a huge variety of play styles and weapons/magic/miracles to choose from and it's an added bonus that you can not only forge weapons from bosses, but also forge them from tails of certain bosses if you manage to cut their tails off.Last but not least, the ambiguous lore really adds to the experience as well since it's intriguing not quite knowing the answers but having to imagine yourself what's really going on. You're given fragments of information through item descriptions and and clues through all sorts of details when you're playing. There are barely any cutscenes. Nevertheless, there are some problems - level design starts to suffer in the second half, one boss sucks so much A S S that you'll question if you want to touch this game ever again (but makes up for having some of the best and most intense at least), and poor framerate at times. Overall, this is one of my favourite games of all time and I'm glad I got to play this. You'll die a lot and at times question why you're playing a game where you die so much. But trust me, it's worth it. Overcoming the challenges of certain areas and bosses or even discovering things yourself are incredible sensations of joy that Dark Souls emulates so well.			"

												                                                    This game is wonderful if you have the patience for it.       Your first run is going to be garbage. Now I can't say that for a lot of games, but this one really holds true to that. I put fifty hours into my first character, only to figure out that my build was♥♥♥♥♥♥ the combat was lacking, and overall my experience was flaccid. Instead of playing it safe with a simple sword and shield, I made a new character with a strength-focused build.

Thoughts like that are what makes this game so damn re-playable.        The dialogue in this game (albeit limited), is pretty involving.

I won't spoil it for you, but god you'll know it when you see it (I'm looking at YOU, Lost Izalith).      Combat is extremely satisfying, and the move style for many weapons are very unique. Of course, you can't have every sword swing in some ridiculous special way, but you can still feel the difference between each one.      PVP is mostly dead at this point, but there's still the chance that you can be invaded by other players. Not much else to say besides that.      The difficulty of the game isn't nearly as much as it's acclaimed to be. Maybe I'm just fantastic at this game (har har), but as long as you're patient and accustomed to the combat, it's a breeze. I'm not saying it's easy, but rather that it's fair.      This is one of my favorite games, and despite having so many hours in, I'm sure I can squeeze an easy hundred more out of it.			"

												I loved this game more than I imagined I would, but I want to stress something: the game is a great game overall regardless of its difficulty.  This game is not just noteworthy for being unforgiving at times: it is an amazingly well-designed game in general.  My friend had been trying to get me to play it for years and I finally got around to it.The level design is possibly the best I have seen in any game.  Other games like the Metroid series may have done it first but it is absolutely delightful how so many of the areas interconnect, and opening a shortcut to find out it led back to somewhere I had been in a way I never expected was always extremely rewarding.  Aside from two instances in which you get rings to survive in certain areas the progression itself is not like Metroid, but the level design most definitely is.  It's disappointing to hear the second and third games do not have such a complex interconnected layout, but this game set the bar so high it would be very difficult to match it.That leads me to another thing about the level design: This is a game that takes place in a three dimensional world.  Too many games treat the world as mostly 2D with perhaps a couple floors of height. This game is absolutely massive, and that includes the use of vertical space.The difficulty was not as bad as I expected.  One particular fight did take four hours of attempts to beat, but the game overall was not as consistently difficult as I had expected.  While bonfire (checkpoint) placement can be moderately far from a boss battle sometimes, without exception you can learn to run past most of the enemies to get back to a boss battle fairly quickly.  I am sure unforgiving difficulty ramps up considerably in New Game+, but I am talking about just a normal run of the game.  Fighting bosses in this game is very much akin to the Mega Man series.  You learn the moves they can do and how to deal with them, and eventually you take less damage than they do and you win.  I am not someone that is into tough games, but it is still very satisfying finally beating a touch foe.  My friend put it well: he said the game has a high learning curve and people mistakenly think that means it is very difficult all the way through.  The game has tough moments, but most of all I think it is a very fun and satisfying experience.In short, this game is among the best because it is so incredibly well-designed.  That it can be unforgiving at times is not			"

												Dark Souls is like taking a really huge dump over and over.It can hurt! It can REALLY hurt! You may bleed a bit!But as soon as you made it you feel so incredibly relieved! And then it's time for the next dump!To be serious it's not THAT hard. Yeah you die sometimes. No big deal.As soon as you get used to the controls (controller strongly recommended) it's a fantastc game in an awsome dark fantasy setting where all npcs are depressed or insane unless they are sunbros. Sadly it has a really werid coop System that forces you to play a mayor part of the game by yourselfe even if you want to coop 24/7.I would even call it a singleplayer game with the possibillity of killing bosses in jolly cooperation. Oh, and PvP. PvP is ok.8/10 Because i have feelings for Solaire of Astora!			"

												Although I started to play the PC version of this game in its twilight years, I can easily  say that this game is one of the better gaming experiences that one can have. The combat, level design, voice acting, boss design, and environment all mesh well together to convey an overall theme of utter despair and hardship.

												If you like instant gratification, this game is not for you, however, if you have the tendency to put your genitals into the blender just to see what happens... This game might just be what you want. (Disclaimer: don't put your genitals, or any bodyparts for that matter, into the blender.Dark Souls is hard, it is as hard as you've heard it would be and then some. But boy does it feel goed when you finaly kill that one enemy, usualy only to find out there's actually two more around the corner. The game gives you little to go on for that matter; if you die, you're propably not on the right track, yet. Either that or you have to step up your game a little.But where the game itself doesn't tell you to much, the other players actually help quite a lot; with information scrabbled on the floor or as a spirit against a boss. When they are not helping you however, prepare for some prison shower♥♥♥♥♥♥invasions in which you will definatly get the worst of it. But that might just be my bad luck talking.The short version of  real review would be:Do you like to level up against foes you cannot beat? Do you like to see yourself die, a lot? Do you want to pummel your low level enemies into the ground when revisiting an area? Do you want the most awome stuff?Yeah? buy this game.If you do not want to try and try and try again, just so you can die 5 feet further, play farmville.And don't forget: praise the sun.			"

												Best game, no save/checkpoints but instead ""bonfire"" which is saving your progress. You really need to play for a long time if you have progressed far, and dying means more playing if you had much souls. No pause option either so if you do need toilet break or open the door, just clear the area completly.This game is scary as any horrors game or even better. I never played any Dark souls before, and I find myself raging and agonizing most of the time. Be warned that the difficult tag is not there by mistake!			"

												Bixo, vou te contar uma história sobre esse jogo. É que nem você sair por aí tentando achar a mulher que é o amor da sua vida. Vou começar comparando com uma festa. Você começa conversando com aquelas mulheres que não são tão lindas, aquelas que você vê que são menos confiantes mesmo só pra esquentar. Aí você vê uma linda e fica meio nervoso... Mas ♥♥♥♥-se, sempre vai ter mulher por aí né? Você esquentou e ralou pra se sentir confiante, aí a rainha com rosto reluzente, cabelos brilhantes, olhos azuis que nem as águas do Caribe e com corpo de Deusa Grega do Olímpo te dá a maior patada que você já tomou. A conversa não durou nem 5 segundos. Você sai♥♥♥♥♥♥e frustrado achando que ela é uma vadia de♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Reclama pro seu amigo que toda mulher é uma vadia que não presta.Você vai esfriando enquanto tenta dançar um pouco, conversa com mais umas mulheres, faz umas amizades com uns brother no meio do nada e decide chegar em outra mina linda. Talvez na mesma. Você toma outro tapa emocional que arranca sua alma fora.Você não desiste e começa até a se divertir tomando esses tapas. Uma hora você taca o ♥♥♥♥-se e decide que nessa festa você não vai conseguir arranjar uma aspirante à modelo da Playboy.Aí acontece.Você tenta mais uma vez, depois de se ♥♥♥♥♥ x0 vezes seguidas e sempre tentando diferente, mas dessa vez você percebe alguma coisa a mais, algum bagulho diferente que você não tinha notado antes. Do nada a mulher tá te agarrando como se você fosse Zeus em pele e osso. Você não tá acreditando. Sua mão ta tremendo pra♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ você não sabe direito o que fazer, mas aconteceu e você tá em êxtase. Você sabe que valeu a pena se ♥♥♥♥♥ todas aquelas vezes pra chegar aonde você chegou. E bixo, daí em diante você só melhora. Passam alguns anos e quase toda modelo de bíquini com quem você conversa tá na sua mão. Você já tá confiante pra♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥e sabe que provavelmente vai dar tudo certo, e também tem certeza de que se você se ♥♥♥♥♥ é muuuuito fácil tentar de novo. Você entende que se ♥♥♥♥♥ na verdade não é se ♥♥♥♥♥, mas sim uma chance de tentar diferente. E♥♥♥♥♥♥que pariu, sentir isso é um sentimento do caraaaalho.Agora velho, quando já se pensou que a ♥♥♥♥♥ de um jogo virtual seria exatamente assim? Dark Souls. Tu só se fode, fica♥♥♥♥♥♥pra♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aí enquanto voce tá no pico da fúria, como se fosse Deus tacando um meteoro no Brasil porque ele tá♥♥♥♥♥♥pra♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥por causa do Fluminense ter caído pra segundona, do nada você mata o Boss.♥♥♥♥♥♥que pariu, tu não acredita, treme, entra em nirvana e é como se fosse uma explosão de emoção dentro de você.Compra, joga e não desiste. 10/10			"

												*IMPORTANT*If you do not have a gamepad hooked up to your computer, Dark Souls has an incredibly difficult control scheme using IJKL for your right hand, as the mouse does NOTHING. Buy a cheap wired controller for the X Box (or similar) at minimum, else you will not enjoy Dark Souls to its fullest.*Review/ Why is this game impossible?!?!*Dark Souls has some of the best combat mechanics of any RPG. Each of the plethora of weapons has its own distinct style of fighting, with different styles being more useful in certain situations than in others. Whilst the massive learning curve at the beginning of the game seems brutal, mastering the basic controls will take you far. Whilst the game may seem impossible in some situations, it's only really difficult because you're trying to achieve something in the least effective way. Swinging a sword around in cramped tunnels is far less effective than stabbing enemies with spears, but the sword is more useful on an open field against multiple opponents, while a slow and more powerful weapon (such as a great sword) will be more useful against bosses. Also, be observant of your environment, as it will save you from some nasty deaths. Find a bridge which is scorched, has parts of it on fire still and has multiple dead scorched bodies on it? It probably means that something burnt it all to a crisp and it may still be around, so be careful.Also, think about what type of build you want to make. A jack-of-all trades who does magic and uses miracles (like magic, but more focussed on buffing yourself via healing and similar) whilst wielding heavy swords and wearing armour will mean that you will spend a lot of time trying to grind levels, which is incredibly tedious. So instead, before you begin, ask yourself ""What type of style do I want to play as?"" Once you have a general idea, poke around on the internet to see what stats are relevant to that class/ style before you start. If you don't get it right immediately, that's OK. I personally had gotten a fair way into the game and realised that my person wasn't what I wanted, as I was struggling due to running out of health potions constantly. I switched from an un-optimised warrior to a cleric with miracles to heal myself, and it made my first full run through a lot easier than it would have been otherwise.One of the most useful things one can do once you arrive in Lordran (a message telling you that you are in Lordran will appear up the top) is to look at a route telling you where you should be going. Whenever you enter a new area, a message will appear up the top informing you so. Using a guide such as this one ( http://darksoulswiki.wikispaces.com/Game+Progress+Route ) will help you know what you should be looking for.So all in all, after being told how to make the game seem less impossible, should you buy it? If any part of the above interested you, then yes, you should buy it. If you're looking for a new game to play with fantastic fighting mechanics with awesome boss battles interspaced, then yes. If you're simply looking for a new game to play and invest some time in, then yes. And if you really want to understand why people are excited for a Dark Souls II, then buy it.			"

												TL:DRIf Dark Souls was a person, it'd be a dominatrix girlfriend. It will abuse you, make you feel worthless, like you're less than nothing, but you stay with it because every now and then, it gives you the night of your life, where it makes all of your messed-up fantasies come true.EDIT: I beat the game recently (a week or two ago since this edit) and while I really enjoyed it, I found it to be REALLY unfair quite a few times. *Cough* Sen's Fortress and the Tomb of The Giants *cough* I still pretty much agree with my initial review of the game, although that first dungeon I was talking about was actually one of the last you're supposed to go to. (Oops on my part, and dickish on the developers'. I mean come on, a little hint in the right direction would've been nice, especially since it's damn near impossible to find your way out of said dungeon) Nevertheless, if you're up to a quite intense and brutal challenge with many deaths, swear words, ragequits and sleepless nights, then I definitely recommend this to you.Kept this part because people thought it was funny or something:Do you hate your life but not have the guts to end it? Well, worry no more! If you buy this game, you'll have COUNTLESS more reasons to hate yourself, and it'll give you the push you need to kick that bucket just as hard as I kicked my computer after trying to beat the first dungeon with a MAX LEVEL character. (Hint: I failed) Seriously, I like my games challenging, but I also like them possible. I'm beginning to think that the developers of this game only made it so difficult because they were too lazy to program anything past the first 9001+ hours of the game. (Which is to say, the first dungeon) In the time you could beat the first dungeon, you could've beaten the Water Temple from the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time approximately 98,432,753,985,476,219,743,057,239,764,396,329,743,765,964,329,746,975,649,762,197,265,976,493^85,749,938,938,659x10^9001(Omg^bbq/wtf) times with your eyes closed.

												Best game, no save/checkpoints but instead ""bonfire"" which is saving your progress. You really need to play for a long time if you have progressed far, and dying means more playing if you had much souls. No pause option either so if you do need toilet break or open the door, just clear the area completly.This game is scary as any horrors game or even better. I never played any Dark souls before, and I find myself raging and agonizing most of the time. Be warned that the difficult tag is not there by mistake!			"

												PC Port - Not good . Options menu sucks . Default controls are pretty bad ( Esc on del , really ? ) . Every menu got console marks . Optimalization is okey . Sawed worse ( I recomend to download DSMfix to change options ) . It is really hard ? Well yes . BUT . When you spend some time playing it (cca 20-60 + ) game will become easier to you .+Combat systemStory Pretty alot of classes etc You can change every mele weapon from 1-handed to 2-handed +/-Nothing-PC Port . Verdict  - Great game with good dark story but with bad PC port 7,5/10 ( If it got better port I would give 9/10 )  "

												I give this game 10 stabs out of 10, with extra rage sauce on it.More seriously, I've been playing this game a lot lately. It's fun but my fps are kinda ruining it. I do not recommend the game if you do not possess a gamepad, as the game is not adapted for keyboard and moouse.. Well, it is, but it's really clunky.The overall game is hard, but it's enjoyable, once you reach a certain level of understanding of the game, you get to actually win most of your attempts. The only downpoint is that you will have trouble with the environment (exe: Ledge that looks reachable by rolling, dying even though the fall wasn't so hard just because the map wasn't designed like so)EDIT:I've got a much better computer since the last time I wrote this review. The game is intense and fun. Although there is a new game out (Dark souls 2) I'd still pick Dark souls 1 over it. The bosses and the universe is so much more deep and immersive than the second that I find it hard to like the second one.There is very few players on the game anymore, sadly, but it is still an excellent experience to pick up with your friends if you have some. This game have a huge replayability even if you always end up building the same way than your other playthrough because you were good with it. (Dex + faith anyone?).			"

												If classic video games have equivalents in the realm of literature, I'd argue that ""Dark Souls"" is video gaming's very own ""Paradise Lost"" or ""Divine Comedy.""  It's basically a big, brilliant, video game rendering of hell.  Not so much in its setting, although it is set in a land populated by undead, but more so in its game mechanics.  “Dark Souls” is a game all about suffering in the pursuit of perpetually unfulfilled and unfulfillable desires.  Such an approach to gameplay certainly isn’t new to video games. Many MMO’s have made an endless progression of “carrots on a stick” into a business model.  What’s unique about “Dark Souls,” however, is its hostility to the player in obtaining these carrots.  It goes out of its way to make sure that players suffer in pursuit of the desire to beat the next boss, get the better armor, or level up one more time.  Not only will you die and die repeatedly, but once you accomplish one desire, there’s always something new to replace it (another boss! another set of armor!  higher stats!, New Game +!, New Game ++!, etc, etc, etc).  Indeed, upon completing the game, in the “good” ending your avatar’s body is burned off into nothingness, perhaps being freed from its perpetual cycles of unfulfillable desire, yet you yourself are spit right back into the start of the game, repeating everything once more only with harder enemies and the devious promise of greater rewards.The conception of hell as being existence dominated by perpetually repeating cycles of unfullfillable desire probably has more relationship to eastern religious traditions than western (no surprise that the game is Japanese). In other words, in its gameplay mechanics, it could be argued that “Dark Souls” is basically “Paradise Lost: Buddhist edition.”  There are western analogies too, though. CS Lewis outlined a similar conception of hell from a Christian perspective in ""The Great Divorce,"" arguing that hell is ultimately nothing more than a mindset characterized by endlessly and obsessively repeated cycles of thought.  And for the atheists among us, Sartre's ""No Exit"" might be another literary analogy, not only because Sartre defined human existence as the mind’s impossible desire to be both being “in itself” and “for itself” at once, but also because the ability for players in ""Dark Souls"" to ""invade"" your single player game and kill you at inopportune times makes the famous statement in ""No Exit"" that ""hell is other people"" completely apt.In case it isn't clear, though, saying that playing “Dark Souls” is like being in hell is maybe one of the nicest things I’ve ever said about a game.  ""Dark Souls"" is not just one of the leanest, meanest, and best ARPGS I've ever played, but one of the best video games I've played, period.  It’s a game where everything it has to say is reduced entirely to the language of its own game mechanics.  It’s not trying to tell a story, or create compelling characters, or be a movie or a book.  It’s simply a game and any meaning that you could potentially derive from this comes almost entirely from its status as a game.  This makes it, if not one of the best RPGs ever, definitely the most honest.  It's just simple, unadorned, brilliantly designed, and entirely compelling gameplay. An RPG boiled down to its absolute essence of dying, developing combat skills, and dying again in the endless pursuit of more loot and more power.  The lack of trappings such as plot or character that might distract from what it actually is, gives the game the odd and entirely unique effect of deconstructing itself as you play it.  You quickly realize that any goal you obtain will inevitably be replaced by another goal that’s further away, so you actively start to question the point of pursuing those goals....in the same heartbeat that you willingly spend 2 more hours grinding souls for armor that you don’t need (because it will raise my physical defense stats by 5 points, damn it, so I have to have it!).  No game has made me question my own motives and reasons for playing it, and, indeed, actively dared me not to play it, more than “Dark Souls.”  Which I think is kind of brilliant in its way.  “Dark Soul’s” ultimate lesson, if it has one, is that in games, as in life, the only way to truly beat the “hellish” cycle of perpetual desire is to quit playing entirely.

												I loved this game more than I imagined I would, but I want to stress something: the game is a great game overall regardless of its difficulty.  This game is not just noteworthy for being unforgiving at times: it is an amazingly well-designed game in general.  My friend had been trying to get me to play it for years and I finally got around to it.The level design is possibly the best I have seen in any game.  Other games like the Metroid series may have done it first but it is absolutely delightful how so many of the areas interconnect, and opening a shortcut to find out it led back to somewhere I had been in a way I never expected was always extremely rewarding.  Aside from two instances in which you get rings to survive in certain areas the progression itself is not like Metroid, but the level design most definitely is.  It's disappointing to hear the second and third games do not have such a complex interconnected layout, but this game set the bar so high it would be very difficult to match it.That leads me to another thing about the level design: This is a game that takes place in a three dimensional world.  Too many games treat the world as mostly 2D with perhaps a couple floors of height. This game is absolutely massive, and that includes the use of vertical space.The difficulty was not as bad as I expected.  One particular fight did take four hours of attempts to beat, but the game overall was not as consistently difficult as I had expected.  While bonfire (checkpoint) placement can be moderately far from a boss battle sometimes, without exception you can learn to run past most of the enemies to get back to a boss battle fairly quickly.  I am sure unforgiving difficulty ramps up considerably in New Game+, but I am talking about just a normal run of the game.  Fighting bosses in this game is very much akin to the Mega Man series.  You learn the moves they can do and how to deal with them, and eventually you take less damage than they do and you win.  I am not someone that is into tough games, but it is still very satisfying finally beating a touch foe.  My friend put it well: he said the game has a high learning curve and people mistakenly think that means it is very difficult all the way through.  The game has tough moments, but most of all I think it is a very fun and satisfying experience.In short, this game is among the best because it is so incredibly well-designed.  That it can be unforgiving at times is not			"

												Personal Rating: 6 of 10If you ever thought of sinking your grubby hands into this game, you must remember that winning isn't the goal of the game; dying is. I play RPGs like Skyrim, Risen, Witcher, well you get the idea. Some might classifiy those games as amateur stuff but trust me, Dark Souls takes RPG difficulty right to the next dimension. I basically got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked by a bunch of common low level skeletons. This game requires tonnes of patients to play so be warned. Also the controls are horrendeous even with a controller (yes I do own one) so I don't blame the port. To give a little insight on the difficulty level:- Game is open world where there are no quests or story to guide you so you simply explore and pray you are in the area that suits your level.- Puzzles are challenging (I consider finding exits as puzzle) because there are no indication and some places are well hidden.- Since there are no map you need to memorise the location.- Enemies are tough and can easily kill you. They sometimes spawn in a group that consists of range, melee and tank so you really need to plan. Potions are limited and it takes time to consume so imagine the mini boss and boss fights.- I really doubt that there is anyone who can win in an encounter with a mini boss or a boss the first time even with the clues given in game as you really need to study the behaviour. I once encounter a gigantic minataur and it charges at me non stop. During me second reload,  I saw arrows raining behind and notice a tower which I can climb. I thought well there it is the place where I can snipe this brute. Third attempt I climb the tower and dispose of the 2 skeletons and begin my genius plan. The minataur was just below the tower and he leaped onto the tower behind me and charge towards me knocking me down and I died. - I don't really understand the story since the opening cinematic and the beginning of the story has no relation but then again, I gave up on the game before even progressing 5% maybe? This may cause confusion since you have absolutely no clue on what to do or where to go.- There are no quick save or save point I dare say unless you progress till quite the next area. In order to recover your health you can rest at bonfires but this will cause all minions to respawn as well. This can be good since you need to grind for souls to upgrade youself or buy some items.- You need to figure out the system in the game since tutorial is close to nothing in this game.- Exploring is really rewarding as you can get powerful items you need to keep your eyes peeled and question every damned thing.Configuration options are kept at minimal since console don't have much to configure but there is a resolution option. The graphics is relatively nice but I am rather satisfied with the voice acting. Overall Dark Souls is a decent RPG game and it is meant for real hardcore RPG fans with passion, wit and wisdom. The reason for the 6 is not because of what it is lacking because I'd assume it is what makes the game and that it was planned this way. But I think the port is really bad even though there are some mods to compensate for but I generally think it should be the developers responsibility to bear.So unless you are in for some frustrating death and repetition, Risen and The Witcher isn't really such a bad game.

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #39 - Dark Souls: Prepare to Die EditionI like that they called this Prepare to Die Edition, as a not so subtle warning about the difficulty of the game.  My first death was pretty hilarious.  I went through this portal and ended up on a ledge above a huge Asylum Demon.  I'm looking down on this guy thinking to myself that he is going to kick my♥♥♥♥♥ and trying to figure out a strategy.  I thought to myself, at least I am safe up on this ledge, and no sooner than I thought that, the demon smashes the ledge with his ridiculously sized hammer, and I fall to my death.The game doesn't start off immediately hard.  Instead it gives a tutorial to ease you into things.  In the first area, you'll run across a series of messages which will introduce you to the different controls in the game.  So you get some time to get a feel for things before you are thrown in the grinder.I thought the graphics were okay, but it's pretty obvious that this is a console port.  I also found it much easier to play with a controller rather than the mouse and keyboard.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it a bad port, it's just more of a straight port without any graphical enhancements for the PC.  This may be a turn off for some, but it didn't really bother me any.As difficult as the game is, dying doesn't really have much of a consequence other than having to restart from the last checkpoint.  There's no permadeath or anything like that.  The game expects you to die many many times, and to experiment with different combat strategies.  If you are easilly frustrated, this game may not be the right one for you, but for me the combat was a lot of fun and outweighed the frustration of dying.  For $20 I definitely think it's worth the buy, just heed the title and be prepared to die.			"

												Dark souls is like dangerous drug. You know it's very bad for you and you know, that it will most likely kill you. It will ruin your life and make you very desperate and sad, but for some reason you just simply can't get enough of it. you always keep coming back to try that stuff again.EDIT:After completing the game, I can say that this was truly one of the best games that I have ever played. Yes, Dark souls is hard, but the feeling you get after you finally beat that one boss you've been stuck on is so great that you want to keep going. This game gives you the feeling of power. You have the power to defeat every obstacle that comes into your way. If you can't defeat, then you level up. Maybe discover new weapon with neat fire-damage. Maybe you find new armor that looks super cool.Dark souls is a good game			"

Every boss you kill you are rewarded. For this is not a easy game to just pick up and play. No you must learn mechanics. Of my 3000 hours (xbox and pc combined) I have never once been bored, You can go and do pvp whenever you want, summon people to your world just to help you with a hard area, or just go it alone in this world. This is probably one of the best games out there, it actually makes you WORK for victories. Buy it, its WORTH the experience. 10/10, best game ever made.			"

												About two years ago, I stopped playing this game because Blighttown frustrated me to no end. It came to the point that I gave up, never touched it again, but liked it enough that I bought its sequel. The same thing happened to Dark Souls II; I got tired of dying a lot that I gave up on it after 25 hours. With the surging popularity of the series once again with the release of Dark Souls III I decided to give this game another shot. As of now, I've finished my Thief playthrough and began playing through New Game 1, and at the same time started on another character, a Cleric. It's a terrible port, even with DSFix it's still runs slowly, but it's now my favorite game of all time. No other game gives such satisfaction from defeating a boss. So if you're tired of playing modern games that hold your hand too much, give this game a try.			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Dark Souls: Prepare to Die is a action role playing third person style game, a spiritual successor of Demon's Souls. Based on ""Don't make the same mistake twice philosophy this game is definitely challenging and not for the weak minded. I honestly cannot count how many times I died on Dark Souls, it says it in the title but still doesn't prepare you. So Dark Souls, a fantastic game which will make your blood boil when you die, but brilliant none the less. The combat mechanics based around medieval weapons, levelling system and exploration of this game are what sold it. I really enjoyed the different style of play to most games. If you have heard or enjoyed any of the Dark Souls series this is where the heart is, I strongly recommend playing it.The Game PlayBefore you start on your journey you are able to create a character. By choosing a class you are presented with various options and choices related to a point based skill system.I chose a deprived class which lets you start off as pretty much a blank slate. Possibly one of the more challenging characters to play, but one that you can shape, from the get go.After character creation you play a cursed undead (Hollow), locked away from the world. Which needs to escape, on the way out you face up to some nasty enemies and other things.Killing said things will give you lovely souls which is in game currency for everything. When I say everything, I mean everything.Killing is done in a variety of ways, with different weapons to magic.Dying means you drop those lovely souls you have acquired, giving you one chance to redeem those souls from where you died. Failing at this chance means you lose those preciously saved souls forever. Hint: Don't die.... Right?DifficultyThere is no difficulty setting in this game, yes this game is truly unforgiving but practice makes perfect. Once you get used to dying and possibly loosing many souls. From either running into a the wrong room with lots of enemies. Going through the dreaded mist, completely unprepared with only a broken sword to between you and a huge demon. Or just falling off a ledge due to bad timing or bad player habits.This game is as difficult, as you make it.Once the game is completed the games difficulty increases, with a new game plus mode, this will happen every time you complete the game if you can stomach it.Controls & InterfaceI strongly recommend using a controller for this game as playing with a keyboard is like giving the monsters a bigger advantage, why anyone would want to do that, is like crazy.AchievementsThis game has steam achievements. Which increased my enjoyment and challenge of the game and one day I will get 100%.... one day. Hurray I have done this now!StoryThe plot of Dark Souls is minimalistic which I found interesting as it made me want to find out more about the game (Dark Souls Wiki). With so much to do and not much direction other than your weapon of choice as the guide, I soon found myself exploring and reading. A great way to find new and interesting items, enemies or ways to die.If you truly love this game like I do, check out the wiki page story and lore is absolutely brilliant and even some of the fan theories based on in game descriptions are fantastic. The developers really know how to tell a story, with each character you meet they all have their own goal and agenda which is so well put together.If you are unsure what I mean and are thinking to yourself that story was crap.Please check out some of the YouTube (personal favourite) summaries and theories.Combat System Combat is based on swords, axes, hammers, spears, shields and bows etc... The weapons mostly have different swing sets,  different movements, ranges and speeds. Which increase your choice of killing weapon and replayability.Not only do you get vast arsenal of weapons to choose from but you can also train and learn pyromancies, sorceries and miracles.The combat is fast pasted and real time so thinking quick and being ready to roll can save your life.I loved that Dark Souls combat keeps you on your toes, as pretty much every distinct enemy that you encounter will move and attack in different ways depending on the weapons they hold, especially the bosses.Levelling Stats & SpellsAs before I mentioned acquired souls are currency, you spend souls to level up at a kindled fire place, any unspent soul is a potential lost soul.Spending souls to level will increase a variety of stats and also let you equip bigger heavy weapons or better spells.Sounds  & EffectsThe game sounds are really decent and fitting for the gloomy world which was once ruled by dragons.Although I am sure you will get annoyed by the blacksmiths constant hammering.GraphicsThe graphics although now possibly seen as dated to some, I still feel they are done excellently.I have always found Dark Souls games to have lovely designs, views and imagination from the level designers.Cut ScenesWithout spoiling anything I found all cut scenes epic, increasing my immersion into the game.Humour & TriviaDark Souls has a surprisingly lot of background information supported by communities. I spent hours on the wiki page looking up weapons strategies and different things about the game.A well known fact that Dark Souls is a spiritual successor of Demon's Soul, but both are actual successors of a game called King's Field.Also if you ring either of the bells it can be heard in other peoples games. Pretty cool although as of late fewer and fewer people are playing due to the latest releases of Dark Souls genre.Game UtilitiesThe game offers auto save feature, where ever you log out or leave your character. He/she will be right where left off.This is to stop anyone trying to back track to avoid boss rooms and losing all their souls, which works brilliantly in my opinion as there is no escaping death.Kindled fires offer sanctuary, but resets all slain monsters (except bosses) so be wise when you go to rest.MultiplayerThis game is mainly single player but with some interesting multiplayer features.Players may use summon signs to be summoned by other players to aid them with area bosses. This also works vice versa, but you need to be human to be able to summon (Human Effigy).Players may also invade others in player versus player style combat fighting to the death to retain all the glory, finishing with a gesture of course.Keep in mind you may also join, in-game covenants that give special benefits or that suit your play style.Bugs - ImportantI didn't encounter any game breaking bugs on this game, although trying to play co operatively with a friend is tricky and may need a bit of prior research into how it works before you can do it easily.As there are a few things regarding same steam download server region. Not only that but you must be in the similar level range, plus the area boss has not been defeated for summoning host.If you are playing this solely offline then you are able to summon non player characters to help with boss fights, you must be human to see summon signs.ConclusionOverall I found this game extremely fun to play and enjoyed every ounce of it, even if you decide to get this game and only get to the Belfry Tower Gargoyles I'll be impressed.I personally think this is a fantastic game I will always remember killing my first boss, it was a good feeling even if it was with a broken short sword and many deaths later.Still felt like I missed so much out.You Died.... All to often.Hope I helped, good luck.ηυĸєΜ266 "

												About two years ago, I stopped playing this game because Blighttown frustrated me to no end. It came to the point that I gave up, never touched it again, but liked it enough that I bought its sequel. The same thing happened to Dark Souls II; I got tired of dying a lot that I gave up on it after 25 hours. With the surging popularity of the series once again with the release of Dark Souls III I decided to give this game another shot. As of now, I've finished my Thief playthrough and began playing through New Game 1, and at the same time started on another character, a Cleric. It's a terrible port, even with DSFix it's still runs slowly, but it's now my favorite game of all time. No other game gives such satisfaction from defeating a boss. So if you're tired of playing modern games that hold your hand too much, give this game a try.			"

												THE PROS:Dark souls is known for its difficulty, its teeth grinding, controller breaking difficulty. But to me it is much, much more. Dark souls is a game that takes years to master, and has been part of my gaming history for years and I cant stop coming back to it. The game has the most depth in its lore I have ever seen and I am doubtful I will see a more complex story then this one. There is a story behind every room, item, and character, and quite frankly I am in love with it. The way the story is told is just fantastic. You are dropped in a universe you know nothing about, right at the beginning you can go one way with enemies that are suitable for a new player, or you could take the wrong turn down a dark shadowy path to a group of enemies that one shot you. Thats what I love, you see something too hard for you, progress in another area only to come back and best that enemy. It is insanely satisfying. I love the fact that while progressing at any time you can be invaded by another player who will utterly destroy you. It adds so much unpredicatability to the game that you are on the edge of your seat when you see that invasion notification. The pvp is also insanely in depth and has many different ways to play it. Not only this but I have never seen such a strong community. Players are always sharing stories and things they find in the world. With a wide range of fan art, it shows the true appreciation the players have for the art style of the game and themes the game holds.THE CONS: The only cons I can find in this game is the port. To be blunt about it, the game was literally copy and pasted from the xbox 360 version. That being said you need to use mods online to fix up the game to be playable if you are not using a controller.			"

DARK SOULS: PREPARE TO DIE EDITIONDark Souls. Where to begin?HARDEST GAEM EVURIf you've never played this game, you are likely here because you heard it is the hardest game in the world. This is not true. Dark Souls is not hard, but it requires a dedicated player. The game is unforgiving, and wants you to quit, it wants you to refund it, it wants to annoy you and frustrate you in as many ways as it can. But it does this without ever being unfair. You may throw your controller accross the room screaming about the BS death you just went through, but that is how the game will teach you. It's likely that you will be required to lay off a boss the first time you meet it, purely to learn how to approach it, or how to dodge it.WHAT'S UH... THE DEAL?The story is not told at all, if you want to learn what the hell is going on, you'll need to study one of the thousand or so lore items that hint towards things. A good example of this being that until recently, we didn't know the entire story of the Blacksmith God was written on the image of the Titanite Slab in an old gaelic language. You know you have some amazing and detailed story when it's taken 6 years for someone to find that out. I won't spoil anything, all I'll say is you'll be questionning ""why?"" alot, because you won't know what is going on, or why you are in the middle of a giant fetid underground waste city, but if you actually look into the location details and item details, you may find it out, or through tidbits of dialogue you get from the depressed and mostly ignorant characters.MASTER OF KARATEThis game is heavily focussed on combat. It is the thing you will be doing most aside item farming. The combat system is recognisable as one of the most intuitive and well designed out there, prompting games with similar actions to be branded ""Soulslikes"". Of the hundreds of weapons in the game, everyone is as viable as the next. I know what you are thinking... So, a small sword is just as viable as a 20 foot long axe made from dead demons? Well, yes. And no. Dark Souls lets you build your own character from scratch, you can level up what you like when you like and wield what you like.RATINGOverall, Dark Souls is a fantastic RPG experience, with masterful silent narrative, oustanding combat, and that edge that kicks you in the butt and tells you to keep on going. Not only is it the best in the series, but it is in competition for the best video game of all time. For that, it earns an easy 9.9/10. "

												A fantastic, yet difficult game that tests diligience, determination and ability to learn. Paying careful attention to the atmosphere and secret-laden environments creates one of the most beautiful and fantastically epic adventure games of the past few decades. Some will say that the game is difficult to the point where you feel like thrashing your keyboard or breaking your controller, but as you learn to adapt to the game it opens up a new style of gameplay...one where you as a player have to be at full attention permamnently, or face the bloody screen of death!

												Dark Souls easily gave me the most unique and indescribable gaming experience I have ever had. Yeah, you're going to die a million times but it will never be the game's fault, you will learn from every mistake you made. Dark Souls teaches you by its gameplay and not by its non-existant casual tutorials. Dying is not a frustrating thing in this journey, but the essence which makes this game so unique and outstanding. Sometimes you will get punished so hard even after you died, but you'll just want to keep playing. The gameplay is so simple at first glance, but in fact, it's deeper than the depression I felt in when I got cursed by those freaking frogs. I just can't tell how many secrets the game has, it's mind-blowing. And jeez, that level design... I have NEVER seen such genial, fluid and complex level design in any game, EVER, and at the same time it's so easy to memorize every inch of Lordran's amazing world. This universe is vital and thanks to its amazing community, Dark Souls is still a living, full of life experience.After all, I thought I've seen everything in the gaming industry, then I did give a try to this masterpiece. Dark Souls is easily the best *game* I have played in my life and I only saw the tip of its nearly heightless iceberg. 10/10, would lose my soul(s) again.			"

												Pros:+Interesting world and lore+Fun gameplay and PvP+Wide variety of weapons and playstyles+Plenty of secrets for you to discover+ReplayabilityCons:-One of the worst PC ports I've played. Installing  DSFix [www.nexusmods.com] is an absolute neccesity if you want this to be even remotely playable at framerates above 30.-Hitboxes can be very inaccurate at times-Try playing this without an 360 controller. I DARE YOU.Overall. I LOVE Dark Souls, however the way From Software has haphazardly given us what could be considered one of the worst console-to-PC ports the gaming community has ever seen may not seem appealing to those with technological inepitude and the inability to fix it. Regardless, once you DO fix it, it really is a great game.			"

												Dark Souls is one of those games that try to avoid the norms of the industry, and successfully does it. An incredible hard game for the newcomers, that makes you think before engaging, doing the same thing over and over again doesn't give you a different result, if you're dying a lot it's your fault. It's a game that takes time to learn how to play it, you explore and explore, try different weapons and sorceries and find your play style, and then you need to learn how to best use it against different types of foes.An incredible experience, and one of my favourite games ever.

												Probably one of the best action adventure games since The Legend of Zelda. There is so much to explore that you will get immersed in the game's moody and dark atmosphere. The game is, to the core, Nintendo Hard of the best kind. Difficult gameplay that will keep beating you down but then standing right back up and trying again. It's the kind of difficulty that gives you the sense of accomplishment and happiness when overcoming the most troubling of obstacles. The world is also very interconnected so you can either co-op with strangers to defeated bosses or invade other online players for that feel of hunting your prey. Get this game, it's so damn worth it.			"

												Dark Souls: Rustle Your Jimmies Edition can be played one of three ways. It’s either that you spend hours tenaciously fighting in a nonsensical world, you spend days training for the quickest speed-run through a still nonsensical world, or you spend months learning character motifs/ reading item descriptions/ observing architecture/ and even research why a certain item was found in a certain place. For a 2011 release by a company primarily known for an exceptional PS2 series, this was undoubtedly a gamble. Their budget is apparent in the repeating textures, copy-paste mob placement, and cut dialogue that would have made interesting additions to the game. Yet despite all this undeniable laziness, the game makes up for it in clever use of map design, unique weapon and armor design, and a lore deep enough for things to still be discovered 5 years later. Essential themes of the game are comparable to Maslowian self-actualization psychology, the cyclic nature of Uzumaki by Junji Ito, and many other hipster sources. In all seriousness, Dark Souls: Fiddle Your Diddle Edition is not a perfect game, it’s not nearly as hard as youtubers will make it seem, but it’s not nearly as easy as speed runners will make it seem either. If you're still debating whether you should get it 5 years later, you should, and beat the game at least once. No matter which of the three ways you choose to play it, have fun and good luck.			"

Famoso por ser um jogo difícil, Dark Souls também surpreende pela sua sombria e curiosa história.Nota: 9/10Você joga como o Chosen Undead, desenvolvendo um papel determinante na profecia sobre o fim da Era do Fogo. Durante sua jornada em busca de almas que permitarão o alcance do seus objetivos, você explora diferentes áreas do reino de Lordran, como castelos, esgotos, florestas, cavernas e muita outras áreas, todas com uma pesada atmosfera erma e soturna que cria uma sensação de tensão e isolamento que marca a franquia.Um grande motivo que me fez gostar do jogo, não é apenas apenas o desenvolvimento da história em si, mas como ela é transmitida ao jogador. Como sua jornada é relativamente solitária, salvo alguns poucos NPCs, única forma de compreedê-la é pelas breves conversas com os personagens, descrição dos itens e mesmo pela observação do ambiente, e aos poucos você monta o quadro do que levou o reino a ruínas, assim o que parecia simples se torna uma rica história.Não tem como fazer um review desse jogo sem abordar os problemas de port, a FromSoftware cometeu um erro gravíssimo em deixar um jogo desse calibre chegar ao PC com essa qualidade. Porém, existem patches e fixes não-oficiais que habilitam recursos gráficos ociosos e consertam problemas, como as texturas e fontes do jogo estarem em terríveis resoluções, alguns problemas ao se jogar com teclado+mouse e outros erros menores. Depois de aplicá-los, o jogo se torna muito bonito, com paisagens únicas e belos lugares com ótimas qualidades gráficas.Apesar da produtora ser japonesa, o gameplay é um clássico dungeon crawler ocidental, todos os elementos de RPG estão presentes no título, como a criação de personagem bem flexível, possuindo magias, armas corpo a corpo, arcos e bestas disponíveis para sua escolha de combate preferida, upar seu personagem como você quiser, fortalecendo uma das formas de combate descritas ou usar um pouco de cada contra inimigos e bosses cada um mais forte e bizarro que o outro. Cautela ao se jogar é muito recomendado, porque além dos inimigos serem muito fortes, existem inúmeras armadilhas e falcatruas que garantem ao jogador uma morte certa. É bem possível que você morra várias vezes tentando vencer um boss ou tentando passar de alguma área, mas isso faz parte da experiência, o jogo não tem como subtítulo Prepare to Die por nenhuma razão, mas é altamente recompensador vencê-los.O áudio geral do jogo é também muito bom, a trilha sonora realiza seu papel de criar e reforçar a atmosfera proposta pelo jogo.Reforço o que está avisado na página da Store, controle Microsoft Xbox 360 é altamente recomendado para jogar, eu testei o do PlayStation 3 e mesmo ele apresenta problemas que atrapalham a jogabilidade.História: 10/10Gráficos: 8/10Áudio: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10 "

												This generations Chrono Trigger. It sets the standard for role play action combat, and somehow hasn't been played (or completed) by a massive amount of people. The visuals, combat and atmosphere still stands up to this day. Truely a flawed masterpiece.			"

												Introducing: ""Dark Souls: Prepare to Die"" PC edition!New features include:-Some free DLC-Controller compatibility (only for the weak)-A whole new difficulty setting""New difficulty?"" you ask.Yes, it is called ""Mouse and Keyboard/PC Gamer Mode."" It is approximately 217 times harder than the base (controller played) version of Dark Souls.Some players (the weak) believe this to be the result of a poor port from console. However, this was actually done on purpose. This mode negates any and all complaints that the game is ""not hard enough"".Just unplug your weakling controller and try beating the game using only mouse and keyboard, I promise that, if you want difficulty, you won't be disappointedThere are only 4 endings to this mode-""I can't even navigate the menu this way, I'm calling my mom to cry"" (Pleb)-""This is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't even get out of the Asylum, I'm starting a complaint forum to express my frustration"" (Weakling)-""It took me 6 hours, but I finally beat the Aslyum and I'm now in therapy to cope. I'm plugging in a controller"" (Veteran)-""If I had a dollar for every time I died from falling or because I couldn't turn and fight the thing attacking me; I could pay off the entirety of the United States' debt. I only got to the top of Blight Town."" (Expert)-""Once I made it to Anor Londo I collapsed; I couldn't take it any more after that. I no longer remember my real name. I feel as though I have lived and died thousands of times. I have frequent hallucinations in which I become disoriented before being crushed by giant boulders or attacked by red-glowing nudists with massive swords. The sight of balancing beams, churches, snake-men, bridges, emaciated persons, and many other seemingly harmless entities all trigger violent and horrifying flashbacks. I am now in a mental institution. I can hear the demon lumbering, breathing, and growling under the floor. I think it is getting restless. I just need to wait for the key so that I may finally escape. The Crow will be here soon, it must be, I know it will be."" (Godlike)			"

												If you want more reviews for TV shows, movies, games across all platforms, and more, come check out my blog!http://gandhigaming.wordpress.com/Also, be sure to use this link below if you do purchase this game, otherwise it WILL NOT work. http://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/864980153227392683/Thanks to my friend Shadow for sending me this link before I purchased this game!To be honest, I meant to do this review earlier because it would take too long for me to beat the game, as the average playthrough is about 60 hours long. To add on to that, my crave to review games is pretty hard to contain. So, here's my review of Dark Souls, arguably the best RPG of last gen to many.Dark Souls has been highly praised by gamers and critics and was a solid GOTY contender, but it was overshadowed by Skyrim, which got all the attention. It's true, I am a Skyrim fanboy and I love everything to it, but this game still deserved a lot more recognition than it got. Plus, now that I got a handy Xbox 360 wireless controller, I wanted this game bad. However, I still was worrried due to GFWL ruining my experience. Thanks to one of my awesome friends though, he gave me a link that would fix that annoying problem. But, I don't want to provide negatives because of GFWL and all of that, Enough of my nonsense, to the review!GraphicsThe visuals look outstanding yet bland at the same time, depending on how you look at it. The world of Lordran is beautiful about 70% of the time, while the 30% is the more dull part of the game. The dull parts of the game though are harder to explain, and half the time you won't even realize the bad parts to the visuals. The atmosphere is thrilling, dark, and epic. Not much to say for the visuals, heck, even the character models aren't too bad, but there's nothing too great about it.GameplayThe gameplay is easily the strong point to the game, no doubt. Everyone says the game is hard, and that's certainly true, but when someone describes the gameplay to Dark Souls, they always just say ""Wow, this game is HARD! Did I also mention it's hard?"" and whatnot. I'll give you an unbiased non-hard mentioning gameplay review here. The combat is smooth and actually pretty realistic. Your supplies are actually LIMITED for once, and also the combat is nice and slow because you aren't some kind of MGR Raiden or DMC Dante. You're a regular warrior/sorcerer/knight/pyromancer/whatever else there is. And plus your stamina actually is important unlike other games. Because of the realism in the combat, this game can be very slow at times. Therefore, Dark Souls is for the most patient of gamers. They don't mind repeating the same part over and over again while discovering new ways to get to the next point in the game. The successful realism and well paced gameplay makes Dark Souls have some of the best Action-RPG gameplay seen in years. Phew, check it out, no mentioning of the difficulty! Woohoo!StoryThe story may seem vague at first, but then you realize it's basically a puzzle- find the pieces and put them together to make one big picture. It isn't straightforward at all. It wants you to talk to the NPCs and all of that, which makes Dark Souls pretty heavy in lore when you know where to look. You're no god or some kind of super prophecized legend or anything (although in a way you are) and yet Dark Souls successfully does that. The story is what most dark fantasy games should have. There's also Solaire of Astora (Praise the Sun!) on the ""bright"" side of things and he is known to be a very enjoyable character in the game. I also made a song I'm still working on, but let's not get off topic.AudioDark Souls' audio is among the best I've seen when it comes to sound effects. Again, Dark Souls successfully captures some of the realism intended into the game. The knight, more specifically, sounds amazing with the sound effects instead of listening to the normal quiet footsteps even the most armored of people have in other games. As for the voice acting, everyone seems dark and grim, a major pro to a game that's trying to have a dark theme to it. And for the music, the songs don't really play that much, but when they do, you know you're in big trouble or you're in a safe place. The soundtrack actually is a guide in this game, providing signals to you when traveling throughout Lordran.ReplayabilityThe replayability is pretty strong I hear. Like I said, I never had the time to beat this game yet, but I hear there's new game+ and you can also make multiple characters. Based off of what I seen, the people who stay to enjoy this game get an easy 120 hours. VerdictIn the end, Dark Souls is an outstanding RPG no one should miss, given you don't mind a challenge. Dark Souls is what dark fantasy games should be like. The atmosphere is perfect, the sound effects realistic, and the gameplay smooth. In fact, sometimes when I play Skyrim, I view myself as if I was in the world of Lordran, traversing through the beautiful undead world. If Skyrim could make me do THAT, something is going right with Dark Souls. Even if it isn't my favorite RPG, Dark Souls is one outstanding, dark adventure other Action-RPGs should be looking at.Graphics- 6.5/10Gameplay- 10/10Story- 8.5/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability- 9.0/10.:9.1/10:.+Smooth gameplay+Strategically placed lore+Amazing sound effects+Brilliant atmosphere (No game has been that good with atmosphere since Bioshock)+Lots of realism for a fantasy game+Solid replayability-Mediocre to above average visuals			"

												Dark Souls is the infamous action RPG that you've already heard about. You've probably heard about how difficult and punishing it can be, but it can actually be quite easy if you learn how stats and equipment work. GameplayYou CAN get through the game by learning enemy attacks, baiting out certain moves and punishing them, all of which can be very fun if you like action games; however, this game is an RPG to it's core with a slew of different damage types and armor resistances, meaning some damage types will work better depending on the enemies' armor. These basic RPG elements impact the game rather heavily, meaning you can simply change weapons/armor and turn a difficult boss fight into something trivial, even though you still need to know the fighting basics.Because of this focus on damage types and stats, you might assume that your starting class will determine what bosses you find difficult, but in Dark Souls your equipment changes your gameplay more than other factors. While playing Dark Souls you can often just change equipment, dynamically changing your build as you find out what works against certain enemies. With all of that said, luckily the foundational RPG elements aren't completely enforced, you can always just learn the boss's patterns and win with a build completely ineffective against the boss. Or you can just use Havel's set, the Black Knight Halberd, and chug like a scrub winning no matter what.Art DesignAlthough Dark Souls is a rather solid gameplay experience, Dark Souls shines best when you can appreciate the art design. I'm happy to say with this game the marketing is pretty much spot on, so if the marketing materials interest you, you won't be dissapointed.Final ThoughtsIf you like the idea of an action RPG with a focus on RPG elements, you'll enjoy the gameplay. If you like a dark, gritty, atmosphere with lots of dangerous creatures, you will like the art design.Even if you just think the marketing looks cool, the game is 5 bucks on sale, so might as well pick it up.

												Dark Souls is a game I will never forget. I don't really know what to say about this game, I personally think it is a masterpiece. I've put well over 1,000 hours on Dark Souls on console. If you have not played this game, you need to.I do want to bring up the problems with the PC version though. Basically it's broken. You have to download mods to be able to get the game to work. Also you have to play this game at 30FPS in order for it to work properly otherwise your jumps and everything will be messed up. I personally spent around 4 hours setting up this game, but this game was worth all those hours. "

												По-моему игра просто великолепна! Но всё-же 9,5 из 10!Это РПГ с чисто японским подходом к созданию игр, то есть ""Всё не как у всех""! Ты начинаешь играть и понимаешь, что ничего не понимаешь! В ней нету никакого обучения, ты должен всему сам учиться! Для меня это огромный плюс, т.к. устал от игр, в которых тебя ведут за ручку, press x to win и т.д.Прекраснейший дизайн локаций, отличный геймплей (да ещё и хардкорный, который заставляет ""попотеть""), одновременно жуткие и прекрасные боссы и враги, притягивающая атмосфера, необычные рпг составляющие и ещё многое! Обязательно попробуйте поиграть!P.S.: Ах да! Чуть не забыл! В игре есть офигительный ""мультиплеер"" - PvP и PvE режимы! Оставляют хорошие впечатления)			"

Famoso por ser um jogo difícil, Dark Souls também surpreende pela sua sombria e curiosa história.Nota: 9/10Você joga como o Chosen Undead, desenvolvendo um papel determinante na profecia sobre o fim da Era do Fogo. Durante sua jornada em busca de almas que permitarão o alcance do seus objetivos, você explora diferentes áreas do reino de Lordran, como castelos, esgotos, florestas, cavernas e muita outras áreas, todas com uma pesada atmosfera erma e soturna que cria uma sensação de tensão e isolamento que marca a franquia.Um grande motivo que me fez gostar do jogo, não é apenas apenas o desenvolvimento da história em si, mas como ela é transmitida ao jogador. Como sua jornada é relativamente solitária, salvo alguns poucos NPCs, única forma de compreedê-la é pelas breves conversas com os personagens, descrição dos itens e mesmo pela observação do ambiente, e aos poucos você monta o quadro do que levou o reino a ruínas, assim o que parecia simples se torna uma rica história.Não tem como fazer um review desse jogo sem abordar os problemas de port, a FromSoftware cometeu um erro gravíssimo em deixar um jogo desse calibre chegar ao PC com essa qualidade. Porém, existem patches e fixes não-oficiais que habilitam recursos gráficos ociosos e consertam problemas, como as texturas e fontes do jogo estarem em terríveis resoluções, alguns problemas ao se jogar com teclado+mouse e outros erros menores. Depois de aplicá-los, o jogo se torna muito bonito, com paisagens únicas e belos lugares com ótimas qualidades gráficas.Apesar da produtora ser japonesa, o gameplay é um clássico dungeon crawler ocidental, todos os elementos de RPG estão presentes no título, como a criação de personagem bem flexível, possuindo magias, armas corpo a corpo, arcos e bestas disponíveis para sua escolha de combate preferida, upar seu personagem como você quiser, fortalecendo uma das formas de combate descritas ou usar um pouco de cada contra inimigos e bosses cada um mais forte e bizarro que o outro. Cautela ao se jogar é muito recomendado, porque além dos inimigos serem muito fortes, existem inúmeras armadilhas e falcatruas que garantem ao jogador uma morte certa. É bem possível que você morra várias vezes tentando vencer um boss ou tentando passar de alguma área, mas isso faz parte da experiência, o jogo não tem como subtítulo Prepare to Die por nenhuma razão, mas é altamente recompensador vencê-los.O áudio geral do jogo é também muito bom, a trilha sonora realiza seu papel de criar e reforçar a atmosfera proposta pelo jogo.Reforço o que está avisado na página da Store, controle Microsoft Xbox 360 é altamente recomendado para jogar, eu testei o do PlayStation 3 e mesmo ele apresenta problemas que atrapalham a jogabilidade.História: 10/10Gráficos: 8/10Áudio: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10 "

												Dark Souls... Where do you start?It's a game that'll punish you for YOUR mistakes. Not it's own. It's a game that requires skill to learn and play. It's a game that will take you 50+ hours your first time around then you can beat it in <5. The game never gets old because of how open it is, you can do things in so many different ways. Required bosses only? Why not. All bosses? Go for it. Fist Weapons only? Whatever. It's your choice. You don't even have to know the story, you can just fight enemies and not care, or you can go into the lore that each item gives you. It's very open-ended.The multiplayer in the game might be a bit confusing at first, but it's much worth it. The PVP and PVE Co-op just make the game have so much more replayabilty to it. You could get invaded by someone while doing jolly co-operation with your friends through Anor Londo, or walk into the forest and fight off the constant invaders protecting it. You can place your summon sign down outside a boss gate and help people fight the boss over and over, and it won't get boring. The combat just is so fluid and transfers so well to this.Dark Souls is one of the few games I will consider Perfect. It's buggy at times, but really, the game itself past that is a complete masterpice. I recommend it to ANYONE. It'll make you rage at first, but you'll love it soon after once you get that first boss dead.			"

												Dark Souls is an extremely rewarding JRPG with 100+ hours of content, and plenty of challenge and secrets. Dark Souls's strengths come from its exploration, in-depth RPG elements and challenge, which many might find rewarding when it seems difficult modern games are becoming harder and harder to find. The game on its own is fantastic with the exception of some cheap level design, however the port is ♥♥♥♥ing lazy and horrible, and needs a download of DSfix to be truly playable, and it utilizing Games for Windows can make playing the game, especially PVP very frustrating. Dont bother buying the game if you don't have a gamepad, but the game is definitely worth your money if you have one on hand. Dark Souls is a step in the right direction for video games not becoming interactive movies, and is an especially rewarding video game experience worth anyone's time. Buy it.			"

Put the tempeh in a shallow container like a pie pan or some tupperware, Hell I know what kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥you have in your kitchen. Pour the marinade over and let the tempeh soak in that♥♥♥♥♥♥for about 30 minutes. It can marinate for up to an hour but if you let it go too long it can taste really ♥♥♥♥ing salty so keep your eye on the clock.Once the tempeh has marinated for long enough heat up the oil over a medium heat in a large skillet or wok (your mixtape should suffice). Keep the marinade. Lay the tempeh down in one layer and cook that♥♥♥♥♥♥until it starts to brown, about 4-6 minutes on each side. When it starts to look a little dry in there or the tempeh feels like it might be sticking just add a couple spoonfuls of the marinade. See, aren’t you ♥♥♥♥ing glad you didn’t throw that♥♥♥♥♥♥away?Once the tempeh is browned on both sides then you are ready to make an OG sandwich. I like mine with sundried tomato spread, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers (crunchy as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and fresh basil but you add whateverthe♥♥♥♥ you have laying around. ♥♥♥♥ it, use a tortilla and make it a wrap if you like being the ''special snowflake''Now invite Jaque, Pedro and Mohammed or whatever the names are of your ♥♥♥♥♥s and eat cause if u ain't a bunch of fatasses then this is enough for 4 peopleNow we're at buying the game, are you full after eating the sandwiches? yes? then buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game already ♥♥♥♥♥I wonder after how many ''bad'' words i'll get banned from making reviews like this♥♥♥♥♥♥but until then i'll continue writing♥♥♥♥♥♥like this in my reviews.Chocolate Jesus out			"

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupFew words about the gameFirst thing i wanted to say about the game itself, it's the hardest masterpiece I have ever played. For me it's really difficult game, maybe I wasn't ""devoted"" to it enough or something but still, didn't got as far as I'd like to get because it really takes time. Besides screams, broken controllers and rage quits, game offers us a really interesting way of telling us bits of story (i recommend reading everything, it's really interesting but easy to skip) and many breathtaking views. Hope that one day I'll be able to finish this game ^^Advantages - Unique graphics that provide us with lots of beautiful views - Truly epic atmosphere, not only during boss fights - Astonishing and diverse level design, surprising how everything is connected (yeah, whole game is accually one, connected in various ways level) - While leveling, player get more and more skilled together with character - Creative multiplayer in game that merges into singleplayer - Overally good sound effects and soundtrack - Nice ammount of armory to choose from, player easily can match it to his own playstyle - High replay value as here, every step mattersDisadvantages - Horrible PC port, practically unplayable without controller - 30fps lock, if you wish to you can unlock it with some mods but it might result in some errors - Many multiplayer issues - Lacks a little bit of tutorial for new playersIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

												Dark Souls is, to put it briefly, a masterpiece with minor flaws.It's an incredible game, with an entrancing setting that can be both beautiful and haunting.As you guessed from the title, it is very dark, in terms of both setting and themes. However, it's not pitch black. There's always some hope, or some beauty, or some light that keeps this game from being nothing more than a depressing march from start to finish. The game feels more like 'Purgatory' than 'Hell', if that makes sense. Hope is frail in Dark Souls, but this game will never leave you feeling completely hopeless. There is ALWAYS a way.Finally, the big question everyone asks: Difficulty?Honestly, Dark Souls is not the brutally difficult game everyone tells you it is. Aside from two or three actually tough bosses, Dark Souls is only as hard as you allow it to be, as cliched as that sounds. If you appreciate learning, can think laterally and can adapt to meet changing situations, Dark Souls is a very enjoyable challenge. If you allow yourself to get easily frustrated, insist on blindly rushing things, and stubbornly refuse to change tactics if required, the game will punish you, and rightly so, because you're stupid. There is no ""one-size-fits-all"" plan. Dark Souls doesn't punish ""unskilled"" people, it punishes stupid people. In the first hour I couldn't even kill a pair of skeletons, now I've finished the game. Perseverance is critical. If you're going to think like a loser, you're going to be a loser, it's as simple as that. There will be times when you'll want to throw your hands up in the air. Don't do it. Never give up.Dark Souls is honestly not a brutally tough game. For any Brood War players out there, if you could beat ""To Slay The Beast"", you can beat this whole game,  Dark Souls is much easier than that was.So don't be afraid, don't hesistate, do something positive for yourself, and experience Dark Souls. When you make it to the end, you won't regret it. Also, get DSFix. It's a painless five minute install, and is absolutely necessary for a good experience.PS - No spoilers, but there's this thing called a ""Purging Stone"". You might want to have at least one of those on you at all times. That's all I'm saying.			"

												Dark Souls changed the gaming world for me. Its unique atmosphere and playstyle is what caught me and I consider it an ideal gaming world. There are no other RPGs that have the vibe that Dark Souls has, and because it is so unique; I keep returning to it. With that written, I can say that I can spend 1000+ hours on playing this game without getting bored.Ofcourse you die a LOT of times and thus it could not actually be considered ideal; However, the atmosphere really seals the deal. We all have our dark moments and Dark Souls is a great release.I have played this game using my keyboard and mouse. Although it was not recommended by friends and reviews; I did manage to finish it (and I probably took longer than I could have with a controller). The controls take a bit of getting used to, and there are some moves that you might miss out on, like kicking.These missing moves will not stop you from being capable of finishing the game and they will not stop you from enjoying the game (once you have gotten used to the controls).The story of the game is kind of unclear. This could be because:I didn't spend enough time on reading;I spent too much time between dialogues.Either way, I do think that I am not the only one. Why else would there be videos about Dark Souls lore? I definitely recommend keeping up with the story. A story of tragedy, a story of the 'light' against the dark. Prepare to cry, some say.It indeed has a great lore.Last but not least, the atmosphere and story are greatly complimented by awesome soundtracks. Once one has looked into the Dark Souls lore, one will understand how the music dramatically affects the game. This results in some soundtracks being filled with epicness and some soundtracks being filled with pain and sorrow.This review is probably not complete, I can keep on praising Dark Souls. Praise the sun! My fellow sinners!UPDATE: I will add more details to this review and I will make it into a whole when I feel like I have added everything.When starting a new game in Dark Souls, you start off at the character creation menu. So this provides the player with the opportunity to build his/her own character. There are 2 options when creating a character. You can either pick a developer made look or you can go into some of the tiniest details and build your own entirely new and unique look. There is also a lot of gear to pick from in Dark Souls. There is a big variety of weapons and armor sets (including the gear that bosses wear).			"

												Dark Souls... Where to start?  You've heard about it, I know,  and all the hype about it being such a hard game.  ""It doesn't dumb down anything!"" ""The definition of Hardcore!"" ""Other games insult our intellegence, but not Dark Souls!""Those are the types of things I read about it prior to buying it, and now, after playing a little of it, I can say that I don't agree with any of those statements.Let me explain why:So imagine you got a  Belgium Waffle Maker from a old lady's yardsale.  You are excited to try it, but its just so clunky, it doesn't do what you want, and after some time of trying to use it, it only brought you frustration.         Now replace the waffle maker with Dark Soul's controls  and understand that the hardest part of this game       are the ♥♥♥♥ing keybinds.The gameplay is supposed to not hold any hands with the style of the game, but the first tip was how to use the Left Joystick...I tried a few classes out, starting with pyromancer, and the first thing I noticed was that you aim with your nose... and you cant turn your head, so that leaves you trying to turn your body with the waffle controls, just to throw a damn fireball in the tutorial.I'm done ranting for now, but I wish I never bought this game, even when it was only 5 dollars.                                                         --------------EDIT-------------                                           I see that my review seems to mislead people                                    into thinking I was playing with a keyboard, and a                                     controller would fix everything, but understand that                                    I was playing exactly as recommended I should and                                     it still led me to this conclusion.

												when it comes to game titles there has never been such a truth worthy title than darksouls. when playing this game you really do have to prepare to die. however it is still one of the most addicting games ever i mean beside pokemon. Why is Dark Souls so addictive? We play and we die. We die and we die some more. Just when we think we're out of danger, we die. Right when we start the game, we die. There's a lot of dying in Dark Souls; the PC re-release is even called the ""Prepare to Die Edition!"" Any normal person would have abandoned this frustration a long time ago...so why can't we?It's because when we're not dying, Dark Souls is an excellent action RPG. Building our character is great, the dangerous world we're fighting in is fun to explore, and when we do actually finish the quest without dying, the satisfaction is unmatched. Yes, sometimes you make us want to bash our heads against the wall...but we love you Dark Souls. Don't ever change.			"

												The game is great, but the PC port is just terrible.  I can't even go far into the game without it kicking me back to the title screen because of a low framerate, not to mention having to log into GFWL.Buy the console version and avoid this one at all costs (unless you have a great PC).EDIT:  By pure virtue (and Google) did I find fixes for this, so I'm able to play it a bit better, but that doesn't excuse it from being a very bad PC port in all.  If fans are able to make the game better than the devs, then there's something wrong, there.  I'd still recommend getting it on the console if your PC's a bit on the sub-par side or if you have no joypads because it's an exercise in futility to play it in it's current keyboard-mouse config.

												Nope, sorry, I just can't go on with this game. I'm sure many love this game-style, but I have neither the time nor the patience for it. That doesn't mean it is a bad game, it just isn't for me. (Let's see how many unhelpful reviews I'll get for not liking someone's favourite game... it kind of seems people mostly rate unhelpful only because of different opinions, not because the review was truly helpful or not. I mean a review can be helpful even though it doesn't approve of the game - another discussion though...)The good:Great style and atmosphere. Great art design. Dark intriguing (albeit not very obvious) lore. Even though graphics are not amazing it still creates interesting, sometimes beautiful vistas and locations - It fits the style of the game. Great fighting mechanics, and animation. Unique game mechanics and approach to fighting. Lots of exploration. No handholding. Kind of a great ""community game"" since you need other people's help in order to progress - it certainly makes it easier.The bad:Unless you have a controller you might as well forget playing this game. Port is truly awful and requires modding (that is thankfully not too hard to implement). Clunky interface. 30 fps... No handlholding. You need to look up how to progress the game. Ridiculously difficult, and ultra hard bosses. If you easily get frustrated, don't buy this game. A lot of repeating the same over and over and over and over in order to progress.If you are into a challenge that takes time, requiring lots of patience and hard work - you'll love it, If you can get over the sluggish game engine and the fact you must have a controller of course. Otherwise, it probably isn't for you even though many love the series. I know many who have excitedly started one of the games in the dark souls series (because of the hype and the fact so many talk about these truly unique games, that are also sometimes truly beautiful and special, like for example bloodborn), only to have given up a few hours later, cause the game will eat you for breakfast with no mercy whatsoever.Just not for me though.  If you are uncertain get it on a sale.Cheers!			"

												At the very start of Dark Souls past the introduction, Descending a granite staircase early in Dark Souls, you find a Black Knight obstructing the corridor below. He stands with his back turned, oblivious to your approach. A white loot orb glows cheekily at the far end of the passage. Lesser games might telegraph this enemy’s difficulty by showing it rear its head back and screech, flecking the camera lens with spittle shaking the screen and taking the controller away from you and saying ""Look at this scary thing"". But no Dark Souls does it different. The mere outline of the knight’s horned helmet  instantly recognisable from the game’s box art sets your pulse galloping! The game does not come with a warning other than ""Prepair to die"" And you will often be matched with red text across your screen saying ""You Died"" Just in case when you saw your lifeless corpes flop to the ground it wasn't asma or an cardiac arrest. But the deaths in this game does not mean you failed, Dark Souls has a brillant way of teaching the one playing. Learn from your mistakes alright...some times it's just ♥♥♥♥en bull♥♥♥♥♥♥when you press b to roll and it doesn't roll then the sword comes do-...Anyway. Though from the amount of deaths you rally up it only adds up on the sheer sence of accomplishment you get when you over come it. You might hear that alot when reading other reveiws about this game. Mainly because it's true once you've masterd the blade, The Magic, The Miricles you'll wonder how you got stuck before you'll breeze right through the game until new game pluss.My main positive about Dark Souls is it will last a long time. Packed with gameplay that will leave you wanted to re-roll and experience new ways of slaying! From slamming your foe into the dirt to a well placed strike! Dark Souls having the right amount of difficulty that just makes you say ""Maybe this time. I'll do it this time."" It offers you what you want but puts it on the highiest shelf. While the same that shelf looks wonderful the enviroment in Dark Souls is always different from the dirty depths of a sewer to the high polished walls of a city for gods.The PC port though is baaad. And is highly reccomended a 360 pad in order to play, keyboard just don't even... In conclusion get Dark Souls. It's wonderful. A work of art and brilliant to play.			"

												Dark Souls, the game known for its challenge, difficulty, and of course no one can forget the invasions. This game is worth the challenge, once you make it past the dreaded Blighttown, you can expect to be pulled in. To quote a review, ""Its like walking blindly into a shed full of rakes, getting hit in the face repeatedly. You back off for a while, and then you go back for more, untill you find yourself raking all day long."" If you decide to pick up the game, jolly cooperation, and praise the sun!			"

												My Favorite game of all time. Dark souls is one of the once in a life game changing event once you play it. The game is hard but not unfair, you will only die because of your fault not the game. The combat in the game is very responsive and feels great. it is so fun to actually know your characters exact movements and attacks. if you want an easy cinematic experience like Skyrim, this is NOT the game for you. if you  however , like to discover the world of the game and not have the plot spoonfed to you , this will be a game for you			"

												What can be said about Dark Souls that hasn't already been said? The game is hard as hell and it will make you want to cry. But if you can get over that, you will see that it's not just a hard game, but one that tests your ability to learn and adapt. Once you get over one challenge, another one is thrown right into the players face, and you will probably die. But you learned how to over come the first challenge so it will be easy the second, or thrid, or fourth time around. The game is not for the faint of heart, I am 6 hours into the game and I still haven't finished the first part after the tutorial. The key to Dark Souls is to stay calm, take a deep breath and carry on, because the only way for you to beat the game is to stay sane, and outsmart the game.			"

												One of the best game. Why? It's just amazing!What are you waiting for? 5,99€ or 10,99€ its a gift for your holidays!But nevermind, it's good even pay the full price, since for ps3 you can find it for 39,99€ and that say all, this game is 2 years old.It's hard as hell but and isn't a game for all, you love it, or you hate it!Be careful, this game need a lot of patience, energy and time. Don't buy this game if you're just looking for a funny game.Prepare to die, and is not a joke! Enjoy this game, and remember to not give up, never, never, never. Every boss is a tier who you have to climb. Yeah, it's easy with some kind of guide or walkthrough but extremely hard by yourself.Try to play with a Controller (PS3 OR XBOX is the same) becouse it's really hard to enjoy without, so don't buy this IMO if you've not a pad. Oh, don't forget, Dark Souls II is coming out on spring... Don't forget to play this one before, might be a good training :)What more to say.... High skill cape is needed, not the best graphic, but still worth.Don't forget, PVP for PC Is not the best as PS3. And also some boss have bugs, if you're a real player don't abuse.Prepare yourself to get into an epic adventure, cup of tea at your left, and pad at your right, keep calm and RAVENGE YOUR HUMANITY.

												Be warned, you are going to hate this game so much that you love it. Dark Souls brings brutal, unforgiving difficulty that comes out of nowhere in a non-linear open-rpg environment. Only through specific tactics can enemies be conquered, or you will be crushed, sometimes in a single swift blow. One mistake will lead you to death, where you will lose all of your experience until you go back to where you died to retrieve it. Die again before reaching it, and it is lost forever, making you lose precious power. Trial and error is hit or miss. Risk may bring reward or agonizing failure. You will die over and over, and you will love it.			"

												One of the best RPGs I've played. If you like challenging gameplay which is really rewarding, Dark Souls is for you. As of right now I've played it for almost 300 hours.But.It is very recommended to use a gamepad. Either an xbox controller or a controller which can be emulated as one. Like the PS3 or PS4 controller. ( http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-XInput-Wrapper-for-DS3-and-Play-com-USB-Dual-DS2-Controller I recommend this emulator. Especially over MotionInJoy.)It is also recommended to install DSfix ( http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix ) in order to unlock the fps and resolution in order for the game to look a lot better.In short, the game is quite tough. I can't deny that. But it isn't at all as hard as I thought it would be. I would in a heartbeat recommend this game to anyone and everyone who enjoys being challenged.			"

												Ah.. Dark Souls.. You have given me my highest and lowest times in my gaming history. With every moment of joy, you will punish me in ways I never knew could happen. After finally killing that boss.. to being pushed off a cliff by a weak hollow.You will get angry, you will die but you will push on.Dark Souls drops you off into a strange land with very little to go on and sends you on your way. The open world allows you to wander into areas far beyond your skill but as you master the game these areas will allow you to choose how you tackle the start of the game in new and challenging ways.The depth of the story is a bit hard to take in on your first few playthroughs but as you listen more and more you will start to see the world unfold before you.The npcs add a nice and manic flare to the atmosphere, often mocking you or giving you vague information on what you could be doing next. They don't treat you like a hero, you are just some other hollow, passing through, like the rest of them.The amount of gear you can aquire allows for very unique character development and style choice  Meta aside , making it so no 2 characters are the same.This is one of the best games I have ever played and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to take a hit to their ego.

												Dark Souls still remains my all time favorite game.And no, this game isnt hard. As long as you dont try something, fail at the strategy you used, then try it again and again and again 1235435 times. If it doesnt work, try a different strategy. For the most part, its pretty balanced. The only thing they didnt nerf and shouldve nerfed was ♥♥♥♥in wrath of the gods. It stuns most builds, and people are allowed to spam it in PvP, because thats how the spell works. Even with decent armor on, it still takes chunks out of my life. Anyways, everything else is pretty good. Theres so much weapon variety, and nearly every weapon has its own moveset. They all have different attack properties. One sword may have normal attack, and piercing. A scimitar has slashing damage. A rapier has piercing. A mace will have blunt/strike damage. A spiked mace will do piercing damage. And every armor has different strengths and weaknesses to each of these attack properties. Typically lighter armored enemies are weaker to slash damage, most heavy armored enemies are weaker to piercing. I like all this depth because not many RPG games even have this sort of thing thought out. A mace may do the same type of damage as a curved sword, or a dagger used for thrusting. Theres also 3 different types of magic you can add to your character. Pyromancy, which is kinda close range magic. Sorcery, which is more long range. And then theres Clerics. People also do 3 typical different types of weapon builds:Dexterity, strength, and ""quality"". No, it doesnt mean its a real quality build.Dexterity is typically for character builds to use fast, quick attacking weapons.Strength for the heavy hitters, typically the slower weaponsQuality is used for people who want both.Now take all these different build possibilities, and you get a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of replay value. Theres also the many many different weapons to expirement with, and different upgrading paths to expirement with. The story isnt presented like most games are today. With fancy cutscenes, dialogue, etc. A lot of it is through lore. Lore that you must piece together yourself through reading and speculation. If you're too lazy like me, there are many lore videos going over everything.Yes, this game was an extremely lazy port by FromSoft, its evident with the optimization issues and the xbox buttons being displayed for actions.Without mods, this only runs at 30 FPS. But honestly, it looks fine. Not as fluid as other games running at 60 FPS, but you get used to it.			"

												Reviewing this game purely on it's merits as a game and not a PC port, it's fantastic, easily one of my favorite games of all time, possibly my favorite RPG of all time. With one of the best combat systems of any game, you make a mistake, you'll probably end up dying, it's extremely punishing and thus not for everyone but if you put in the time it's VERY rewarding.The world and level design is in my opinion unmatched in any RPG, there's all sorts of secrets to be found in the game by jumping from ledges and rolling onto different platforms to get to secret areas, the game is rife with secrets.The story is incredibly deep, complex and compelling but is told subtly in item descriptions, random observations around the world and NPC dialogue.PvP is great fun but likely will be laggy, it's entirely optional, as is CO-OP, some people love to play the game with friends, some love to solo it, I'm in the latter category but there is something here for everyone.The enemy design and voice acting are top notch, I honestly cannot say enough good things about this game, but I stress, if you do not enjoy a challenge (that's fine) then Dark Souls is likely not for you, oh, and the PC port is a barebones straight console port, but is easily fixed by using Durante's ""DSFix"" Mod.In my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made.

												Y'all Gwynn to Die*laugh tracks*Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. Plays well. High Replayability. Huge variety of builds, equipement and weapons. Keeps you on your toes constantly. Lots of secrets and all. You really have to time your attacks in order to be effective, which keeps the combats interesting all along, even if you're grinding you just feel like you're getting better.The Lore is really fun to get into!The PvP is♥♥♥♥♥♥tho (I had lag problems no matter what..probably becuase I a Eurofag, and most people invading are from america or something, which creates huge delays). And if you get too over powered the PvE kinda loses its interest, but that's what NG+ is there for anyway, so it's not really a problem. It has technical flaws but it doesn't stop the fun. One playthrought will take you At least 40 to 50 hours (more if you take your time and really try to find out about everything)It's not necessarly as difficult as people say it is, you just have to get into it. But it's worth investing time into it, because it's truly rewarding in the end.			"

												So this game came up on the Steam Winter Sale, and at the price point I thought it worth checking out. I had, after all, heard so much about its bone-crushing difficulty and ridiculous levels of '♥♥♥♥ you, player' that I couldn't help but to be intrigued. There had to be something to it, right?So I bought it, installed it, installed the resolution fixes, added mouse capability to it, and started playing.That is when I discovered that Dark Souls is not a 'hard' game. It is simply unforgiving.The last few years of gaming had trained me to be lazy and dare I say entitled. To regenerating health, hand-holding, steamroller protagonists, all the various watered down populist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that has been focus-tested and brute-forced through the mainstream system. Dark Souls stripped all that away without telling me, and I have to say that at first I was furious. How was the starting area enemy such a threat, and why did he remain a threat hours into the game? Losing resources for good due to a single mistake? No map or guidance on where to go or what to do? No teleport pads? What the hell kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t was all this?Then, I had a realization. Those things happened because of me. My mistake. My haste, my lack of care, my poor choice of equipment, whatever. It wasn't because the AI was cheating like a rubberband racer, or a glitch in the game - it all came down to my decisions, for good or for ill. Dark Souls didn't just hand me success, or elevate me without merit, but instead challenged me to rise to the occasion. In that challenge, I found a real sense of triumph in a game that I haven't felt in some time.In a way, this is because Dark Souls puts the PC on much the same or lesser footing than the NPCs. Even the weakest of them can kill a PC in a few combos, even when the PC can one-shot them. There are many more of them, and they coordinate, with the same toolbox of weapons and attacks that the PC has. The only advantages the PC has are the minor improvements to his stats and equipment, which can never make him invincible, and the human judgement behind its actions. Dark Souls demands that the player learn to succeed.Suffice it to say, I am a fan. "

												Holy hell! You better have an actual gaming controller (XBOX 360) to play this game because the mouse and keyboard controls are ATROCIOUS! I'm not kidding. The mouse is clunky as all hell and the controls on the keyboard are ALL over the place. Even after spending about 30 min adjusting the keyboard mapping, the controls were still FAR from ideal. Please don't take this warning lightly. The game seems to have literally just been taken straight from the console and just dropped onto the PC with absolutely no regards to PC adjustments. BE SURE you have a controller on hand before buying this game. Other than that, the game is awesome! EXTREMELY difficult too lol			"

												Dark Souls is a game that doesn't hold your hand, and doesn't want you to want it to. It's a game you learn from experience(read trial and error), or you learn from the community.Myself? I mainly got it from the community. A couple of buddies and some wiki-ing made this game that was once an intimidating cliff into an invigorating hike through the hills. It's not a way to ruin the game, to get others to help you (be it through ""how do I beat this boss?"" or reading a wiki about how to find a certain crafting item); it's simply a different way to play it and enjoy it.This game has the most satisfying combat, one of the most compelling subtle worlds, some seriously cool loot, and an unconventional and interesting multiplayer system.It has it's negatives, certainly; the PC port was not good (DSFix is practically mandatory), Games for Windows Live is not a selling point, the camera can be temperamental, and when you're not progressing it can feel a bit hopeless. BUT; all these things are really a testament to how good the game is because despite all these flaws the game shines through - it's truly grossly incandescant.Bring on Dark Souls 2!			"

												If you want to feel pain, anger, depression and sadness, you did the right thing in buying this game. You will die. No way you gonna survive this game with one life (some pros might). You get beaten to death, you fall, you get poised, you get cursed, you got burned to death and so on and so forth. There are so many ways you will die in this game you won't believe it. Nonetheless you will realize quick that dying is a part of this game like running and fighting. The good thing is that you as a player improve pretty quick. Not only because of the improving equipment you find but also because you improve as a player yourself. You learn how to dodge, when to parry, when to strike. I personally think that Dark Souls shows more than most other games how you improve and learn the game. This is a cool reward.The game has a few problems tho. Without a mod it has only 30 fps. The menus are clumsy and a gamepad is HIGHLY recommended because the Keyboard+Mouse controls are horrible. So you have been warned :)That few concerns aside the game offers a lot of fun. You choose from 4 different attacks. 2 for each hand. It depends what weaponry you have equipped. A heavy axe has a different attack style than a light sword.  The armors influence your speed and how far you can jump and also your dodging speed. The heavier armors really feel like a heavy armor. You can basically feel it on your character. Really well done. The saving system is automatic and if you rest on a bonfire. A bonfire offers regeneration of most effects. It also refills your health potions. So no need to buy one. You have only a certain amount of them but as soon as you rest on a bonfire you get new ones. Be warned tho. If you rest the enemies will respawn. If you die you will be respawn at the last bonfire rested on. As said above your only currency are souls. You earn them from defeating enemies and bosses. No matter if you want to level up your strength or buy arrows or weapons, you use souls. If you die it gets tense. You have to fight your way back to where you died. If you die on the way, every soul you collected and didn't spend for something is lost. That is a hard mechanic and can make you mad, but it is definitely a thrill to get back, especially if you have lost a huge amount of souls.The controls are good. You have to use a gamepad tho. They are pretty darn accurate. You have a lock on system which helps you fighting most enemies. Some huge bosses are better fought without it, especially the ones that fill the whole screen ;)The weaponry and armors are medieval like. Some enchantments here and there for weapons some magic. The basic stuff. A lot to test out and a lot of ways to replay the game.There are so many ways you can play. As a rogue or a flamethrowing knight. Everything is possible.The story is pretty confusing. You don't get that much background. Especially if you don#t listen or meet some characters. So you either listen closely or you check out the wiki on the internet. They are very well written and offer strategies for bosses if you really don't know how to beat them.Well, the bosses. They are great. A large variety. Each with unique moves and appearance. YOu need for each a different strategy, which makes the game even more challenging. The multiplayer is extensive. A big community of pvp players awaits you. Sadly you can't deactivate the pvp completely. So you can be invaded on certain occasions by people that might be way stronger than you and get killed. But those aren't the only ones. People can set markings in certain areas so you can summon them to help you fighting bosses or areas. This is a cool feature, but it is a shame that you can't really play it in singleplayer. Tip. Stay hollow. Nobody can invade you then. Only problem is you don't get some bonuses you would get as human. Well that is enough i guess. Hope you have a little idea what awaits you. I really enjoyed playing it. It was very challenging, but when you beat it. You feel like badass ;) "

												This game will  give you a great rol experience, upgrade your abilities and explore big dark dungeons. Death is inevitable, but you will learn how to play through it. Be carefull, this game's difficult is not as others games'. But, although the intense difficult is a game that you can't stop playing it.Be carefull, hero, dungeons can harbor many tipes of monsters, and you would may recieve a scare... But don't let the terror control you, just kill, kill and BE MORE POWERFULL to destroy the dragons!			"

												I'm a big fan of the Souls series (and Bloodborne of course).This is a game all about sperimentation: try, die, change accordingly to your mistakes (or you will die again). You try out what build best suits you, what weapon is best for your build, and so on. The gameplay is nearly perfect, but in my opinion what makes this game shine is the lore. Miyazaki's way of storytelling is at first glance incosistent. But, like many gameplay and design details, this is a deceive. Try out a YouTube channel that discuss the lore (ENB, TerraMantis, VaatiVidya and many others), and you will find hours of awesome stories. This is a great added value: even if you are not playing the game you are enjoying it.This is the best of the Souls series, don't miss it!			"

												I've played this game more on the PS3, but the experience NEVER gets old. This game is indeed challenging and if you get really stressed out in games, then I won't recommend this to you. Great RPG elements, with the gameplay somewhat like the modern Legend of Zelda games. Even though the lore is hidden within the game, after you learn what happened in the land that you are in, you'll get into the game even more than before. Great characters, great story, great gameplay. 10/10.Edit: Well, after getting all achievements and playing 110 (or so) hours of this game, I've come with the conclusion that this game is my favorite game of ALL time, beating Team Fortress 2 and New Vegas. Graphics: For a game from 2011, the graphics looks alright. Art style is great, as it shows a world where it's meek and honestly depressing. Story: As mentioned in my earlier review, the full understanding of the story doesn't come to you automatically as you play throughout. You need to read item descriptions, go through dialogue, and use the ol' speculation route to learn what happened within the world of Dark Souls. Characters are great, with good development for almost all of them. Controls: Oh boy. This one is questionable in terms of scoring. Simply, the controls for this game just sucks if you use keyboard and mouse. As the store page of this game suggested, it is HIGHLY recommended to play this game with a controller. Especially an Xbox controllerAs my conclusion, this game is a fantastic piece to have in your library and it is an experience that you won't soon forget and with that, it's time to put it back on the shelf. Time to play some Dark Souls II now. ;)WARNING: If you are buying Dark Souls II after playing Dark Souls, DO NOT BUY DARK SOULS II! From Software is going to release Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, which is the ""next-gen"" version of Dark Souls II. It includes improved multiplayer, DirectX 11 compatibility, and improved item descriptions and some other stuff. It will also include all DLCs. More information at the Dark Souls II store page and discussion board.			"

												I'm going to have a hard time describing what's so great about this game. I did not expect the SCALE, SCOPE, and DEPTH that it has. The game is big.SCALE: You can see really far, see objects really high up, and paths and obstacles in the depths below. You feel like you're part of something really big. It doesn't seem like there's an engine limitation that a lot of other games have. Enter a giant mountain, fight your way up, come out the top and see that path from which you entered waaaaay down below. It's teeny-tiny down there! Amazing feeling of heights. Also there's a ♥♥♥♥ing huge dragon not too far into the game.SCOPE: This game is huge and covers way more area than I thought it would.DEPTH: The inventory system is big, and the weapons system and fighting system is big. It's straight-forward so you won't feel overwhelmed, but big enough to give you lots of options as you work your way through the game and discover ways to exploit the weaknesses of your enemies.Overall, this ranks somewhere in the top 15 of games I've ever played. I've been playing video games for 31 years now, having started on a Commodore 64 when I was 7 years old. I just didn't expect this at all.Notes to picky PC enthusiasts: To get the PC version past the graphics-related criticisms I'd have otherwise had, I used DSFix. I read the readme very carefully and brought it up to 1080p (using recommended guidelines for the game-specific settings I didn't understand) and 60 fps. I encountered two ladders in the game where the enhanced framerate would interfere with the collision detection, causing my character to fall through the floor and die. It's just those two ladders, and only happens when doing the ""ladder slide"" move. So for these ladders, simply walk down them normally. I died so often anyway, that this discovery was not an inconvenience. Aside from those two minor instances in the FPS unlocker, DSFix is excellent, so it's worth it to install!			"

												Dark Souls is actually a not very hard game, well actually it's painfully hard almost as if I had to use my tears as payment for progression in the game. I say the game is not hard because it just makes you realize how stupid you are at times, rushing into combat half-cocked or something like that. You always need to prepare (to die) for any and every fight you may get into. I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge and change of gameplay. (You need to play this game very differently than say, Skyrim for example) 10/10 (should have been GOTY)			"

												This is a terrible port, but thanks to the community it's decent now. DSFix is a must to fix the screen resolution issue, google it. And you could pick up some texture mods from the nexus site. This game sucks on keyboard and mouse, I'd really take the controller required disclamer serious. The game is brilliant, it pretty much has alot of old school gaming to it. It's difficulty is a bit exaggerated, and is purely difficult as the game doesn't spoonfeed the player and leaves everything from combat to the story up to his/her interpretation. There is alot of trial and error on your first play. The online play is cute, however not GFWL that is tied to it.The art direction, sound, animation and combat is very good. To me art direction is more important than ""graphics"". Because I'd take Bioshock or this over a Crysis Game.The only weird thing about this game is that it really starts off with a steep difficulty curve, right up to the bell gargoyle fight. This has pretty much made it into my list of favorite games. Just make sure you get DSfix first for this game, and also a controller.			"

												I can't even begin to describe how good this game is, but, i'll try.Basically, it has everything a gamer could possibly want:-It's challenging to the point of frustration (which only makes winning more satisfying)-It has a large array of gear and loot to keep the collectors and completionists busy for a long while-It has a very in depth, delicate and extremely profound and complicated storyline and lore-Your character has a number of different attributes with a number of different combat paths to take-The combat system is one of the best i've seen in a long while, and while it is hard it is very fun to learn-Almost every weapon has its own unique fighting style-It has Co-op-It has PvP-It has Shops and NPC's and sub-plots of different characters woven into the main storyAll in all, this game is almost flawless. But be warned, the learning curve for the first 10 or so hours of gameplay can be unforgiving, so if you do intend on playing this game, make sure that you have cleared your calendar so you can get to the more enjoyable parts of the game. And if you get stuck, try to think outside the box, or just look it up. Some parts are so complex you can be left wondering how anyone ever figured them out at all. It's small wonder that this game was put in the top 20 games ever. I would recommend that everyone play at least the first 3 or 4 bosses of this game to get the true feel of it. It is utterly fantastic.Also, if you figure out how, SAVE SOLAIRE. He is a true bro.			"

												This review is written for people who have played the original for PS3/ XBOX, and are thinking about conquering it for PC as well.----------------------------------------------------->I have recently completed over 100 hours on this version, and I had a blast. After programming the DSFix mod (which you will need, and it's easy to do), the game opened up a whole new volley of excitement for me. At 55 FPS I felt like Neo at the end of the first Matrix, just owning everything I came across. So if your coming over from PS3 or XBOX; Parry, Repost, and Back Stabs are much easier at 55 fps... and Blight Town can actually be appreciated.The downside is that the community is smaller, so there isn't as much activity in the multiplayer aspect. Also, with GFWL shutting down soon, Dark Souls ""may"" become a single player experience. Which will not be so bad for new comers, but for the veterans... that will be most unpleasant. However for now you can use DSCFix, which makes it easier to connect to people.Important NOTES: From ""my"" experience, the DSFix mod does not help for PCs using native graphics. You need a dedicated GPU, and or video card. I shelled out $150 on my NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650, and it runs so smooth. You Will Need-------------------------------------->A game controler (360 or equivelent)DSFix For frame rate and other graphical settingshttp://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?DSCFix For online conectivity with other playershttp://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/334/?----------------------------------------------------------->A Note On My credability: I have already scored 400+ hours, and aquired the platinum for the PS3 version of Dark Souls before playing the PC version, (PSN: Liam_Eibach).

I don't remember much else talk as I didn't venture to the game's specific message boards. I shrugged this off. ""Why buy a game simply because it's challenging? It can't really be that hard.""As it turns out, this game can be quite challenging at times. For the most part, it gets gradually more difficult, allowing for one of the best learning curves I have seen in a game. At the beginning, I could hardly do anything except spam a basic attack or strong attack. By the time I reached the end of the game, I really felt like I had learned a lot about how to play this game better, and I do feel it has made me better at games. I ran into combat with confidence in my ability to outclass an opponent rather than achieving victory because of the enemy being weak. It definitely rejuvenated some of the patience I had lost due to the ease of, well, every other game I have played in years. These feelings were cemented in my mind as I began a second playthrough and laughably passed the first of the bosses that really tried me on my first adventure.Yes, this game can be pretty tough, but there is so much more to it than that.There isn't much dialogue like your typical RPG. Don't expect sequence after sequence of cutscenes. Each item has well-written descriptions along with it that help bring out lore in this world of Lordran. As you progress through the game, the few conversations with NPCs that are related to the story are quite informative despite their brief nature. This is fantastic. There are other NPCs not related to the main story that you meet multiple times throughout your adventure. This game can feel quite desolate and lonely much of the time. But when you meet these recurring NPCs, it fosters a feeling of safety and camaraderie. For such little dialogue, it's incredible how developed one of these characters in particular became.The environments do look dated, but they are crafted in such a way that they are still nice to look at while doing an exceptional job providing an atmosphere unique to the area and design.The combat has a surprising amount of depth by using different moves with different combinations of inputs on a controller or keyboard. Each weapon also creates for itself a unique play style which allows the player to play the game in drastically different manners between characters or, if skilled enough, on just one character.This truly is one of the best games I have played. If you have any interest in an RPG, I urge you to purchase this.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. Don't worry about what people say about the difficulty.Important notes:1. Get DSfix to patch up the iffy PC port2. Don't use a guide/walkthrough3. But don't be afraid to Google something you don't understandAlso be wary that Dark Souls 2 is a pretty different game from this. I bought it literally minutes after beating this (that's how good it is!) but I was pretty disappointed. Your experience may vary, just do some research first.			"

												This is the kind of game you love to hate.This is probably one of my favorite games of all time, and yet whenever I stop to think about it, I realize that I absolutely hate playing through at least three quarters of it. There are areas in the game I simply loathe. And yet, I can't stop playing this. Dark Souls hooks you in and when you're in, there's no going out. Once your soul goes Dark it never goes back.That being said, a good controller and a ton of patience are required. It is possible to go through without either, but why would you? The game is designed for controller, so play it on controller. And the game is designed through trial and error, so be patient. Anyone can beat it if they try hard enough. Just don't give up and praise the sun! \[T]/			"

												Dark Souls is a special game.  Like that one album that made radio hard to listen to, this game raised the bar for millions and created a hunger that, to date, only From Software has been able to satiate.I would encourage everyone to not be discouraged by the legends of its punishing difficulty.  While the learning curve is steep at first, once the player attains fluid control over their character they will enjoy one of the most satisfying combat systems in any game ever made.  The timing windows are somewhat tight, but there's a sublime feeling that comes with perfect dodging, parrying and riposting.  Once you learn the Soulsborne combat system, it can tough to go back to other games.The combat is just one facet of this gem of a game.  The world design is top-notch - there's a delicate sense of beauty to be found within the desolate and oppressive game world.  The level design (especially the first half of the game) is fantastic - not only are the environments varied but there are shortcuts to reward exploration.  Sound design and music are excellent and immersive.  The lore of the game is deep and interesting, but is only hinted at through various dialogues, item descriptions and corpse locations.  The DLC that's included with the PTDE is some of the best DLC ever released.  Both new areas are interesting and at least 3 of the best and most difficult boss fights are found there.This game gets my highest recommendation.			"

												Arguably the greatest game ever made, Dark Souls is atmospheric, complex and beautiful.Your story begins in an asylum where the undead are locked up, never to be seen again, to await the end of the world. That was the plan anyway, but a mysterious figure drops a key into your cage, allowing you to leave the asylum. This marks you as the chosen undead, fated to undertake a pilgrimage to Lordran, land of the ancient Lords.And Lordran is one of the best fantasy worlds ever represented in a video game. Once a magnificent kingdom ruled by gods, Lordran has been overrun by the undead. Yet it still retains its amazing variety, as your quest will take you to forests, swamps, castles, towns, blazing infernos and silent primordial lakes. Lordran's incredibly detailed verticality (indeed you are always travelling up or down) means that the game feels beautifully interconnected and coherent, as you seamlessly walk from one area to the next, uncovering shortcuts that connect to earlier and later locations along the way.Lordran is also a perilous place, and every single enemy is capable of killing you with ease if you're not being careful. In spite of this, the game seldom feels unfair: you lose all your stuff when you die, but if you get back to the place where you were killed - without dying again - you can get it back. This is to say nothing of the bosses. Dark Souls' legendary bosses are in many ways the souls of the areas they inhabit. Every boss fight (ok, Pinwheel excepted...) requires a careful study of the boss' movements and the arena where you're fighting to build up, over the course of many deaths, a strategy to take down the boss. And there are myriad strategies you could construct to take down any given obstacle, since the game mostly rewards all playstyles and equipment choices equally: it is very possible to beat the game using the very first weapon by upgrading it as you go along.All of this is backed up by a story and lore that are revealed slowly, and only when you go looking for them, in conversations with NPCs, description text for items, and the enemies and locations themselves. Nor is the lore ever revealed completely, so the game always feels compellingly shrouded in mystery.Brilliant, right?			"

												So i bought this game a long time ago, back when GFWL was still active. I never got around to playing it though as many other games seemed to be getting better press and reviews. Also didnt help that the community was raging about a poor port job, graphics, controls. So anyway i downloaded the DSFix so i could play at a glorious 60fps and commenced my playthrough. The tutorial area ? Lets call it that didnt really impress me and i started to think this was just some generic rpg like Drakensang or suchlike. So i continued fought my way through the Undead Burg, crossed into the Parish (by this time i was addicted) and died so many times and drank far too much coffee in the meantime. Suddenly though i started to notice little things, other players were leaving hints...tips to get through the game. Words of encouragement were welcome as there were times i had almost enough. I fought my way through started killing off powerful beings with Lord Souls (having no clue yet what the outcome was) struggling to give my undead knight some peace. Battle after battle, death after death and finally i stood before a fog wall ready to do battle with the Lord of Cinder. He fell and i joined the fire and all was good for the undead or was it?.. My final thoughts on the game as i watched the credits were mixed. In a way i was glad that the ordeal was over but still i felt that i would miss it..prompting me to start over . Praise the Sun.

												So this game came up on the Steam Winter Sale, and at the price point I thought it worth checking out. I had, after all, heard so much about its bone-crushing difficulty and ridiculous levels of '♥♥♥♥ you, player' that I couldn't help but to be intrigued. There had to be something to it, right?So I bought it, installed it, installed the resolution fixes, added mouse capability to it, and started playing.That is when I discovered that Dark Souls is not a 'hard' game. It is simply unforgiving.The last few years of gaming had trained me to be lazy and dare I say entitled. To regenerating health, hand-holding, steamroller protagonists, all the various watered down populist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that has been focus-tested and brute-forced through the mainstream system. Dark Souls stripped all that away without telling me, and I have to say that at first I was furious. How was the starting area enemy such a threat, and why did he remain a threat hours into the game? Losing resources for good due to a single mistake? No map or guidance on where to go or what to do? No teleport pads? What the hell kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t was all this?Then, I had a realization. Those things happened because of me. My mistake. My haste, my lack of care, my poor choice of equipment, whatever. It wasn't because the AI was cheating like a rubberband racer, or a glitch in the game - it all came down to my decisions, for good or for ill. Dark Souls didn't just hand me success, or elevate me without merit, but instead challenged me to rise to the occasion. In that challenge, I found a real sense of triumph in a game that I haven't felt in some time.In a way, this is because Dark Souls puts the PC on much the same or lesser footing than the NPCs. Even the weakest of them can kill a PC in a few combos, even when the PC can one-shot them. There are many more of them, and they coordinate, with the same toolbox of weapons and attacks that the PC has. The only advantages the PC has are the minor improvements to his stats and equipment, which can never make him invincible, and the human judgement behind its actions. Dark Souls demands that the player learn to succeed.Suffice it to say, I am a fan. "

												I don't do many reviews, but by the amount of hours I have for this game, I hope you can tell that this is probably my favourite game of all time.The reason.It's a game that can seem impossibly unfair at first, but in reality asks you to learn it's nuances and then challenge yourself to improve and take ememies on in different ways. Initially you become aware of the possibility of taking ""some"" eneimies out without getting close enough for them to take an interest in you using the bow and arrow. I won't say where, that is for the player to find out. But then I decided that that was the wimps way out, and proposed to take these enemies on in hand to hand combat. The result, I died, then I died again. But eventually you learn and defeating the enemie becomes almost second nature. So you proceed deeper into the game and the learning process begins again.The same is true of the boss fights. Initially they can seem overwhelming, but as you learn, you get better. It helps that you can summon other players to help you in these battles, providing the summoning signs are there and you haven't been invaded in ""human"" form. Invasions can be a bugbear, as there can be many players who will seem overpowered. Some have definitely been cheating. But a lot of invasions have a code of conduct. I was invaded, but the player allowed me to clear the game enemies, before pwning me royally. Part of the code is an unspoken agreement not to quaff from your estus flask or use other items to restore your health. Did I mention I suck at PVP though.The whole game feels as part of a whole. The levels are interlinked, with shortcuts opening up back to previous areas as you progress deeper and deeper into the game. The faults with the game.The default graphics and keyboard/mouse settings. Because I kinew the DSFix mod from Durante was out there I made use of that from the outset to enjoy the game in HD. This has been further improved with the addition of mods, that DSFix enable you to use in the game. I have never had a problem using an XBox 360 Controller, so I have not had much experience with Keyboard and mouse in this game. I would argue though that the game demands the use of a controller. Some of the animations felt clunky. Watch some of the enemies jumping and you will see what I mean. The biggest ""fault"" with the game is that once it has sunk it claws into you, it will not let you go. You know that the enemie that is stopping you from proceeding that bit further into the game can be beaten. If you are like me, you will die again and again. You may even walk away from a particular boss for a brief time only to come back to it. But as you get the moveset down, you will want to progress still deeper into the game.Overall I rate this game 9.5 out of 10. It isn't perfect, no game truly is, and it won't be everyones cup of tea, but I love the challenge it represents.			"

												It is hard. It will seem unfair. And at times you will just want to drop the controller, because yes... this game just shows you how it should feel, being one and alone against a horde of enemies, undead and otherwise and with little help from the outside or secure in the knowledge if the guides around you are sincere or reveling in your misery.Welcome to Dark Souls. One of the greatest games I have played in a long time and will continue to play for a much longer time. (At this point over 120 hours in, still want more)Small tip: Do not be afraid of trying out the DSfix and DSCfix patches to help the game get easier. Each victory counts in this one.			"

												After so many hours in only one month - This game has become one of my favourites. So addicting, versatile and arrogating!This is what the gaming industry needs! A true hardcore game. Dark Souls wants you to explore and observate it's world and think before swinging your weapon - if you can't do that you'll fail terribly. I can't wait for Dark Souls 2, an even harder experience.+ Very challenging difficulty (Core-Gamer only)+ Authentic Atmosphere, Good Graphic-Style, Soundeffects and Soundtrack+ Tons of weapons/armors/items for individual playing style+ The game doesn't help you at all, you're alone+ Diversified boss fights+ Long playing time (A lot to explore, and a lot deaths (; )+ (Gamepad) Controlls are intuitional and very handy. The combat system wants you to think about every hit/dodge/block/counter you make. If your smashing buttons your stamina will soon be empty and you are sure to die.+ A few good Online Features (Coop)- Sometimes frustrating- Some glitches and clipping problems*- Unplayable with mouse and keyboard.*- I missed the DLC because I finished the game before doing it. (If you defeat the final boss the new game+ will start)- Graphics are outdated- Online Invaders can join your game with much higher level than you have...- Summon another player for Coop rarely works and if it works it makes the boss fights too easy and destroys the feeling of triumph.[ English is not my first language, so please excuse the typos and errors ]			"

												Excellent game. I have enjoyed every hour (except those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ archers in Anor Londo) playing this game, almost every minute on the edge wondering what was gonna come around the next corner to take me out. I love the lore with this game in the sense you can theorize on a lot of things with other players in the community to piece the story or history behind the characters and environment. Sound is amazing with gripping parts in perfect moments and the voice actors are fantastic, especially at showing how the curse is slowly affecting them as you meet them thru the game. Graphics are not bad, especially if you do a nice mod on the textures, the game can look pretty damn amazing. Gameplay is really good as well, but i do not care for the platforming aspect of the game at all. As long as you are careful you will be ok but there will be times when you may just fall, or have some pretty terrible luck, inducing some good old fashion rage if you had a good chunk of souls or humanity on you. Spends souls wisely, but dont walk around with moneybags on your waist full of the stuff or you will seriously regret it if you die and then dont make it back to your bloodstain. This game is definitely not for everyone, and i can definitely agree as i did not care for the series at all. I am now hooked, weirdly playing them in reverse order, but still enjoying it nonetheless. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants a serious challenge with a good feeling of triumph and satisfaction when you topple that tough boss or pass thru that dungeon that handed you your♥♥♥♥♥a few times over.

												Definately the best RPG trilogy out there, and now that the third one is coming along with Hidetaka Miyazaki directing it. I strongly  suggest that you start your journey without spoiling yourself about literally anything!, thats the beauty of it!, going at it with barely any info on the game and you slowly start to learn and discover the world with some of the most impressive level designs I've seen. Yes you will suffer alot, but know this, there is no artificial difficulty here, simply your thinking and how you will over come the tasks ahead. Whoever says the game is too difficult are simply not playing it right, surely there are no tutorials that pop up in your face every five minutes, so you'll have to learn most of the the mechanics on your own. This game will change the way you look at bosses and how you fight them, and the euphoric moment when you overcome a boss/challenge you couldn't accomplish before is fantastic. Great gameplay mechanics and a beautiful deep story in a gorgeous world with lovely/hateful characters with their own stories to tell. 9.7/10 probably the best game I've ever played,and I don't think anything can top this series.GO ON AND PLAY IT!

												Dark Souls is Incredibly difficult, especially wneh you get poisoned and then you have to go back to a bonfire and then you go out and get poisoned again. But the game is worth playing and there is a steady, if somewhat annoying progression, that will keep you coming back.			"

												The game itself is fantastic but the PC version leaves much to be desired.Soundtrack: 6/10 pretty standard fantasy music, no complaints.Gameplay: 3/10 Dark Souls is a fantastic and immersive game with notorious difficulty, but the PC controls are awkward and no matter where you map the keys it feels uncomfortable to play. The only way the controls are somewhat bearable is if you have a gamepad.Difficulty: 9/10 If you love difficult games then how haven't you already played this game?Graphics: 8/10 Usually fairly good, it really depends on your PC's power.The PC port of this otherwise amazing game is shoddy and I warn you to only buy it if you have a working gamepad/controller.

												I've played very little of this game, but I can already tell you that it's superb. I have over 100 hours invested into Dark Souls 2 and the first one is even better. If you don't already have this game you should get it in the next Steam sale. If you can't deal with 30 FPS then there is a fix within DSFix that uncaps the FPS. This however, can bug the game. So I would keep it at 30. But now to why I like the game so much. The combat and the varation of builds you can do. The learning curve is a bit steep, but once you get it, you have it and you'll love it.			"

												This game has it's shortcomings: some of the combat can feel wonky at first, some of the level meshes can cause you to fall where you feel you shouldn't and sometimes you plain don't know what happened there.That said, the world looks amazing, the monsters legitemately scare me (because they WILL kill you) and the game rewards you for moments where you play well.The game is also tough as nails. I've died more often in this game then I have in any other game I can remember, and I've only played it for 12 hours at this point. However, whereas the deaths felt infuriating and gut wrenching at first, this feeling later got replaced with a sense of challenge; even when you die (which you will, a lot), you usually have a chance to regain what you've lost, and even when you can't it's not a huge deal. TL;DR: If you like a challenge and you have enough patience to get used to the unique nature of the game, you'll find a lot of fun and a hell of a lot of challenge in this game.			"

												Difficult and some times makes you feel like your beating your head against a wall Darksouls: Prepare to Die Edition is wonderful exprience.  While I found it a bit cryptic at times over the experience was very reminiscent of the Metroid Prime games (Some of my Personal favoriates).  While this game requires patience it is over all you feel amazing defeating this game's challanges.Pro-tips:-Use a Controller (The Keyboard controls are terrible).-Talk to friendly NPCs more than once.-Keep a bow and a sluppy of arrows on hand for sniping.

												Mhmm, where to begin? I love this game what can I say? If its not brutal difficuilty or amazingly tight controls (controller) then its the PvP! With around 3k hours in it (over all consoles) I've enjoyed this game so much It's hard to put into words so lets try! Lets start with the story, The actual plot is self is not too interesting at least in my opinion but with all the lore you find and /or figure out on your own  the story you build is one to be remembered. but for a summary, ""You're undead and are the ""chosen undead"" so basically you go to the ""land of acient lords"" to rings some bells. All the small details in this game are just great.  Sorry I don't have much to say on the story, It's fine but the actual plot like I said is alright at best, the lore behind said plot is amazing. Read into it! You will not be sorry. Oh, as a note the game goes for a very lonely feeling, and it nails it very well. Characters come and go. So, Dark souls is know for its ""brutal difficuilty"" as I noted before, while I stand by that the game is hard they're FAR harder games out there, though this game does give a good challenge. The gameplay Dark souls  is a action rpg though the rpg mechanics for me at least was only really in the leveling, It has a tight control scheme that is focued around sword/shield play and spells, Every attack has a wind up time so you need to time attacks not to get hit while in the animation along with managing your stamina and health the game starts to create a amazing risk/reward system in the larger area's (Do I keep going or do I go back to the bonfire and spend my souls level up etc.  Besides this there are a large selection of weapon classes and a good number of weapons, Though almost every weapon in a weapon class has the same Light attack almost every weapon has a different heavy attack (though some are complete clones) as well as a good seletion of armor you can make your character look as you please! There is also a decently large amount of  spells for your choosing. I don't have an overall  a lot to say for the spells.Now, for the games music,  Though the type of music I would never listen to much in my spare time it's amazing for the game! It just gets your heart pumping  since music only plays during bosses and two area's. The music is very intense unless you're listening to one of the actual area sound tracks which have the perfect level of somberness to them.   Ashe lake theme is just amazing  The game has over all pretty good netcode though actually getting into the games of the people you want can be pretty hard. And PvP is not overally active anymore (sadly)  at least on pc.  I find it VERY hard to to give this game a number It's just too personal so well I'm not going too. Though I should say one chain of areas are very low quaility compaired to the rest of the game  and it was clearly rushed. Besides that make sure you get DSFIX to make the game run like a decent game. Oh, and a controller is nice because keyboard/mouse in my opinion is god awful.  I would still recomend this game. Though if you want the game to be a little easier just have some patience and take your time it will really help. Thanks for reading! I hope you have even a quarter the fun in this game as I do because you'll be loving it for years to come. I hope you all have a great day. As always please say if I need to fix something/complaints in the comments, if you would want to watch me play games  you can watch me over all www.twitch.tv/mrfirestorm "

												Dark Souls 1 is probably the best game I have ever played on the PC platform. It is expertly crafted in that the game doesn't hold hands with you, but makes you learn the inner workings through the level design. And this is truly where Dark Souls shines. Each area in Dark Souls connects to others in such a compact way that it is spatially synced to the overworld. The player will find shortcuts which will lead back to a previous area they found. Not to mention the nonlinear path that a player can take. Once you finish the tutorial, you already have the choice of going two ways, and if you picked up the Master Key, you can even take a third path. If you're itching for some epic boss battles, Dark Souls has nothing but the best. Unfortunately, a negative side of this version on Steam is that it is not optimized well at all, and this could be a make or break for many people who are wanting to play this game. Other than that, this game is fantastic.			"

												Dark Souls is the perfect mix of old-school Japanese game design with Western RPG mechanics.It's a love letter to a time when games challenged you, demanded you to make a damned effort; and then rewarded you handsomely with an overwhelming, addictive sense of accomplishment.It's a no-nonsense, pure gameplay game. There are barely any cutscenes. The story (which is rather deep and nicely layered) is told in minute pieces you need to pick up and put together on your own. There are a handful of spoken lines and there's not even any form of lipsynch --every resource was devoted to the *game* part of the game.In a time when everyone goes for the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink school of game design, Dark Souls takes a theme and a gameplay mechanic, and decides to just focus on that. Instead of trying to implement 15 different kinds of games at once and half-assing them all (at best), Dark Souls simply aims to be a game about hitting skeletons with a sword --but then it sets out to be the deepest, most complex title on the subject.The world is large, interconnected, it offers a myriad of ways to go about it, it holds gigantic secret areas, and it just drips with atmosphere. In a whole bunch on non-trivial ways, Dark Souls might just be the one true metroidvania of the 21st century.Dark Souls is one of those things that will be talked about in gaming history books.Do I recommend this game? There is no ""thumbs up"" big enough \[T]/			"

												THIS GAME HAS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL SCENERY (love those environments), AS WELL AS VERY DETAILED AND AMAZING ARTWORK (shout out to that monster art), ALL WRAPPED UP INTO A VAST AND GRITTY STYLED WORLD THAT CONTAINS THE STUFF OF LEGENDS (Hydras, dragons, basalisks, giant clams with tiny legs & hidden lore are included).Many people hate this game, say its impossible & there's nothing worth a look. 'They' probably have anger management problems and no patience. The game starts in a cage, they die, get angry, die faster and more frequently-seeing nothing but stone walls and dangerous enemies at first, they soon rage and quit.""If you try it you might like it""""But i tried it mama!""""Did you really try it? Or did you just eat the slightly burnt crust of THAT GODLIKE PIZZA BAKED BY ODINS VALKYRIES THEMSELVES?!?!?""""GET SOME HAIR ON YOUR CHEST BOY!!!!!"" your mother screams like a drill instructor & slaps uYou will see grand scenery, you will reap treasure beyond imagining, you will FEEL the reward!But only after you trawl through sewers, slay the dealiest enemies, hunt the strangest of creatures, defend yourself from disgusting abominations, to scour the world.This game rewards those who keep cool under pressure & persevere. Get angry, then u get reckless & then you die being reckless. Be smart, learn to properly utilize your arsenal (which can be massive), learn different techniques and tactics, attack effectively and counter appropriately-you'll be the victor. Different weapons and/or different approaches all have their strengths & weaknesses depending upon the situation.THE GRITIf you make a mistake & don't die, then it's a good outcome.If you don't look for openings and attack immediately instead, the enemy may do the same, so you both stab each other & die clutching your stomach-assuming the enemy doesn't have armour enough to endure your hit that is.If you dodge a heavy weapon, before it's lifted back up you can stab that insolent fool in the back if your fast enough-but if you don't dodge it... Your body will be pulverized into the ground.However adept you become, a single mistake or a single random occurence that catches you off-guard, can mean your death.THE PVP & CO-OP IS VERY GOODAlthough there are a few bugs-like the small online delay when receving backstabs from other players (which there are quite a few methods to prevent), it is fairly balanced (there are a few exceptions that are unfairly harder to counter then others to the extreme, but there are ways).I MUST STRESSThat if you like a proper challenge, a first playthrough while summoning phantoms to help may spoil your experience & transform u into a dependant cherub.There are optional areas & hidden weapons-don't miss em! The Great Hollow is a favourite of mine.Bare chest & WARRIOR class for versatity is recommended IMO. 16 strength and 12-14 dexterity for great weapon choice and range.Unless u wanna crush things, then go BANDIT.26-28 strength for 99% of your enemy crushing needs.Barechest is no longer recommended, but rather a necessity.Sorcerer for easier mode, the class starts off wth lazors.25 minimum intelligence to rub crystals on your weapons.Wear a skirt.But if you wanna be a baus, but you also want to fire your lazors, then complete the game without increasing vitality or endurance.

												10/10 would praise the sunFirst of all, you will die, there's no way around it and without help you will die a multitude of times. Yes, you will get mad. Yes, you will want to punch a hole through your screen. This is all on solo with no guides. I know because I used to feel the same ways. BUT when you do complete boss levels, certain goals and parts you were stuck on you tend to get such an amazing sense of accomplisment and relief, only then to die again of course. However, these things will not come easily so don't think they will, unlike other games, the storyline and objectives aren't handed to you on a silver plate; in fact you get roughly one decent hint about objectives in the game made by directors. The other hints all come from messages on the ground which means you'll have to trust in the ""kindness"" of other, be scrupulous don't trust messages as some are indeed trolls. The storyline is also immensely deep and you really have to search for clues, the reason it's not too clear is because the creators wanted each person to imagine it in their own way but there is a wiki which displays what the storylines main ideas are if you want to use that.Basically, yes I recommend this game and will continue to recommend this game. Forever. This is one of the only games that I enjoy replaying over and Over and OVER again not only on New Game+ but with new characters.Although, bear in mind, this game is far from perfect in the eyes of others. There are graphical fixes and online fixes if you want to play with your friends, here is the link...if you do this, follow the instructions CAREFULLY, when I did this I messed up STEP 3 as I editted the wrong file:http://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/828935269278734403/Also, if you plan on using the keyboard I WISH YOU THE MOST LUCK as this was rushed for pc porting as the developers really only assumed it would be wanted on console so therefore made a crappy PC port, so to get the full experience use a controller and a gamepad. Good luck and PRAISE THE SUN!

												If you have never played this game and own a PS3 the nshame on you. If you have never played this game and own a PC then I understand. The PC port has been surronded with negative reception and quips about it's quality. Allow me to distill those fears. With a dedicated resolution fix that is constantly updating and even a FPS unlocker the technical issues that plague this game are basically fixed. If you own a wired controller than the controls won't be an issue and I myself beat the whole game with KB+M with little problem (hint: get used to the controls and adapt). There, port problems fixed. Now you can enjoy one of the best games of the last decade. In a world chock full of vistas and hollows dripping with detail and atmoshpere, your skill determines thew outcome of a seemingly hopeless battle waged against fantastical enemies. Loads of weapons, armor sets, and spells keep replayability fresh with multiple character builds. Combat is polished and tense with each encounter keeping you on your toes. If the challenge puts you off, persevere! This game is one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming if you can claim to master it. Of course, along with the fantastic base game you also get the recently released DLC with adds hours more of content and a some fantastic boss fights. Buy it now and PRAISE THE SUN!			"

												What to say about Dark Souls...Dark Souls is amazing in every way. The gameplay, the story, the lore, and the atmosphere. The atmosphere plays a huge roll in Dark Souls, making you feel alone and hopeless through much of the game, considering that almost everyone around you is going insane. Dark Souls has a very original way of intergrating multiplayer into the singleplayer. Around the land of Lordran, you will find these Humanity Sprites. With Humanity, you have the ability to become ""Human"". When you become ""Human"", You are able to summon other players by finding their White Soapstone. This allows you to engage in jolly cooperation! However, be warned. Becoming ""Human"" makes you suspectible to invasions. Invasions are random, and are forced upon you. The invaders sole purpose is to hunt you down and kill you for your humanity, so be cautious whenever you get invaded! Hands down, Dark Souls is one of the best games of 2011-2013, and it has shown it's worth the phrase ""Prepare to Die"".			"

												This game is deeper than i ever guessed, you have a gigantic Overworld, you have thrilling fights, a really great character development, a huuuuge mass of items and you can evolve your own playstyle.But whats the best thing about this game is this really nice feeling when you killed a boss you battled now for 2 hours or more. Dark Souls has the ability to raise every enemy boss to a nemesis you fight over and over again.			"

												Gloriously fun, unique, and at times difficult rpg. Great storyline along with many hours of gameplay and replay-ability, Play the game more or less however you want. Want to be a mage who wears super heavy armor and wields a massive sword? Then go for it! Invade (or get invaded) players and try to take them out for a chunk of their souls and humanity, summon friends into your world to assist with the zone and bosses, etc. If you are tired of the common rpg styles and are looking for a challenge, then I truly suggest getting Dark Souls and trying it. Yes it is easier with a controllers, but mouse/keyboard is still possible, I completed my first playthrough soley using mouse and keyboard.			"

												This game...i have no words, its one of those games that way to hard for you but you have to push on to find out what waits around the next corner 5/5 the first playthrough is intence...no jokes. but if you are like me and want to get 100% of the achievements then you have to complete the game twice and it gets tedius after you first 80 hours in lordan because you know whats waiting and exactly what to expect so you can just run trough. but if you have the determination to 100% go for it...its defenitely worth every cent			"

												As everyone should know by now, this game is hard. Like, phenominally hard. But as time goes by, you learn when to move where, and what not to touch, and it gets easier. Even after spending 200+ hours on the XBox version, I just had to test my mettle once more on the PC.			"

												Dark Souls still remains my all time favorite game.And no, this game isnt hard. As long as you dont try something, fail at the strategy you used, then try it again and again and again 1235435 times. If it doesnt work, try a different strategy. For the most part, its pretty balanced. The only thing they didnt nerf and shouldve nerfed was ♥♥♥♥in wrath of the gods. It stuns most builds, and people are allowed to spam it in PvP, because thats how the spell works. Even with decent armor on, it still takes chunks out of my life. Anyways, everything else is pretty good. Theres so much weapon variety, and nearly every weapon has its own moveset. They all have different attack properties. One sword may have normal attack, and piercing. A scimitar has slashing damage. A rapier has piercing. A mace will have blunt/strike damage. A spiked mace will do piercing damage. And every armor has different strengths and weaknesses to each of these attack properties. Typically lighter armored enemies are weaker to slash damage, most heavy armored enemies are weaker to piercing. I like all this depth because not many RPG games even have this sort of thing thought out. A mace may do the same type of damage as a curved sword, or a dagger used for thrusting. Theres also 3 different types of magic you can add to your character. Pyromancy, which is kinda close range magic. Sorcery, which is more long range. And then theres Clerics. People also do 3 typical different types of weapon builds:Dexterity, strength, and ""quality"". No, it doesnt mean its a real quality build.Dexterity is typically for character builds to use fast, quick attacking weapons.Strength for the heavy hitters, typically the slower weaponsQuality is used for people who want both.Now take all these different build possibilities, and you get a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of replay value. Theres also the many many different weapons to expirement with, and different upgrading paths to expirement with. The story isnt presented like most games are today. With fancy cutscenes, dialogue, etc. A lot of it is through lore. Lore that you must piece together yourself through reading and speculation. If you're too lazy like me, there are many lore videos going over everything.Yes, this game was an extremely lazy port by FromSoft, its evident with the optimization issues and the xbox buttons being displayed for actions.Without mods, this only runs at 30 FPS. But honestly, it looks fine. Not as fluid as other games running at 60 FPS, but you get used to it.			"

												Ah.. Dark Souls.. You have given me my highest and lowest times in my gaming history. With every moment of joy, you will punish me in ways I never knew could happen. After finally killing that boss.. to being pushed off a cliff by a weak hollow.You will get angry, you will die but you will push on.Dark Souls drops you off into a strange land with very little to go on and sends you on your way. The open world allows you to wander into areas far beyond your skill but as you master the game these areas will allow you to choose how you tackle the start of the game in new and challenging ways.The depth of the story is a bit hard to take in on your first few playthroughs but as you listen more and more you will start to see the world unfold before you.The npcs add a nice and manic flare to the atmosphere, often mocking you or giving you vague information on what you could be doing next. They don't treat you like a hero, you are just some other hollow, passing through, like the rest of them.The amount of gear you can aquire allows for very unique character development and style choice  Meta aside , making it so no 2 characters are the same.This is one of the best games I have ever played and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to take a hit to their ego.

There aren't many games that could ever achieve the fantastic balance of enduring repeat playability and challenge, quite like this game.To say these words is really no justice to this game. These days it is on sale for less than $10. It is worth that many times over...prepare to die, over and over, and grow to love it!			"

												""Dark Souls"" is challenging yet highly rewarding when the challenges are overcome. The land of Lordran is a fantastic and beautiful world with a rich story driven by the sparse dialogue and lore hidden in item descriptions. Unfortunately, the PC version was a first attempt at PC games for From Software and, as such, a few elements suffered. The modding community made quick fixes of all the problems, however, and all are readily available at the Dark Souls Nexus. (http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/) [DSfix is a must and I highly recommend the High-Res UI and Subtitle fonts, ORIGINAL - PlayStation3 button icon textures (if you are using a PS3 controller with MotionInJoy), and Lowest Common Denominator HD Textures!]""Dark Souls"" on PC does have a problem with other players utilizing hacks and trainers as well as requiring Games for Windows Live to play online. If those two issues are a deal-breaker then pick up the PS3 version (or Xbox360 edition if you are homosexual... ""not that there's anything wrong with that"").Some people do use a mouse and keyboard to play this game, but a controller of some sort makes gameplay much better in my estimation. It is one of the few games where the mouse and keyboard really give no advantage. Xbox controllers work natively and PS3 controllers can be used via a program called MotionInJoy.Definitely one of my favorite games of the past decade; I highly recommend this game. Also, do yourself a favor and LOOK UP NOTHING. Play the game blind, at least for your first run.			"

												This game is probably on of the hardest games I've played in a while. It will make you rip your hair out and want to shut off your computer. Dark Souls forces you to pay FULL attention to everything you do in the game. Any lapse in focus will result in the loss of health, or more likely, death. Every enemy you face in the game is a challenge and requires strategy in order to beat. Luckily, you are able to summon other players in game that can help you during the harder boss fights. Unfortunately, you also open yourself up to ""Invaders"" who are players that come into your game with the sole purpose to rip you a new♥♥♥♥♥hole. I must admit, the first time it happened, I yelled at my screen ""WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN!?"", as the Invader killed me, sending me back through hours of work... but I digress. The enemy designs in this game are a breath of fresh air and a great change of pace. There are so many different enemy designs which are memorable and inspired. Another thing I love about Dark Souls, is the level of free reign and depth to the game. There are many different side quests which you can follow instead of following the main story line. The combat system in the game is very fun, yet difficult, to use. There are enough different weapons in the game to make your head spin. From claymores to halbreds, or even a pretty in depth magic system, you can pretty much get through the game with almost any weapon you want. It's not so much the power of the weapon, but the skill level of your character and the skill level of the gamer. You can have a huge♥♥♥♥♥sword with 900 power, but if your hero has the strenth of a 5-year-old, your hero will stumble as they try to swing the weapon.Dark Souls is by far one of my favorite games of all time. All of the different systems, weapons, and enemies, will make any playthrough fun and enjoyable. It also doesn't hold your hand like many games today. It drops you into hell and says ""Do it ♥♥♥♥♥!"", forcing you to learn and become good at the game by yourself. I'd DEFINITELY recomend this game. 9/10~~~NOTE~~~~~- An Xbox game pad or equivalent is basically a MUST- Download the graphical patches for PC to get the most out of the graphics			"

												Dark Souls is perfect for anyone feeling like games these days are too easy, or that they hold your hand too much instead of letting you figure out and explore things yourself. The game addresses this issue by making a challenging, but fair, experience. As if the subtitle of the special edition wasn't apparent enough, you have probably figured out that you will die in this game. A lot. The casual gamer would give up and quit, but the determined gamer will pick themselves up and try new strategies to figure out how to defeat the world's many interesting and dangerous foes. This is where the game really shines (Praise the Sun!). The greatest reward the player can get from the game is overcoming the challenges contained within. On top of that, there is plenty of reason to play through the game a second time...and a third...and a fourth. Different character builds, weapons, spells, optional bosses to defeat, plus lots of other intricacies that can only be experienced by playing more than once through are what increase the longevity of this game even more - after the 50+ hours it will take you to complete the main ""quest"", that is. In short - Dark Souls is not a game for everyone, but if you are looking for a challenge and are a determined gamer, you will get one of the greatest experiences that video games have to offer right now.

												Great game! I got dark souls 2 a year ago and played that for a bit, but never finished. so I decided to get this one to continue the story from the beginning. This game has a lot of problems though, but I'll tell you how to fix thisController fix:This part is easy. Using Windows 7/8/8.1/10, go to device manager and open the human interface tab in the list of devices. Now, turn off all compliant HID controllers(There may be more than one) and your good to go. simple.Fix graphics/framerateMany people suggest going to the Nexus site for this mod fix, but I have a better source( A more secure source). Go to the site http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfixnow, put this in your steam folders and make *SURE* to*BISABLE* the cloud sync properties in your game so the fix doesn't get  erased, this file *Must* be put in the data file *OR* just somewhere where the executable is. Than follow the files instructions on how to unlock framerate and boost the game to 1080p. this script is called DSfix.**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. At first it's punishingly hard, but once you figure it out it's a very fun and rewarding experience. I also find it fascinating how the backstory of Lordran and the undead curse is told through subtle clues throughout the game's world and in item descriptions. I very strongly recommend this game.Also, DSFix and a controller are REQUIRED. Not just recommended. The game is basically unplayable otherwise.			"

												Dark Souls is an exremely fun game. People that it is very difficult, but it is not. The game just doesn't hold your hand. And when you get used to the controls and don't act stupid, it will be fun! The lore/story is not directly given to you, but you have to dig into and delve into the story to discover it. The story is rich and amazing. You will have hours upon hours of fun on this game. Even when you beat it you are presented with a new challenges. The online nowadays is a bit spotty but it is still fun. Hope this helped your descision to buy or not buy Dark Souls! Praise The Sun!			"

												The original and best of the Dark Souls series (yes I own and play DS2 and DS3) - whilst the mechanics, UI and online play in this game are pretty naff, the story, atmosphere and ""feel"" of the game are very unique, something which DS2 and DS3 could not reproduce in my opinion. Definetely a must buy if you plan on playing the others.			"

												Mechanics: Mysterious at first but once you figure them out you can become unstopable. Parrying and backstabs are essential to success but it felt like you needed to rely to much on them. The combat is fluid, the difficulty is good, and the areas are amazing.Story: It's story isn't clear yet it is amazing. The game tells you the premise and reason you are there and then lets you piece the rest out by your self. You will find characters that you will learn to love and help or learn to destroy and kill.Pacing: First you have your typical tutorial level but it isn't as easy as most tutorials. After that you are left in an open world and told to ring 2 bells. 1 above and another below. It's your decision to which to ring first though many chose the top side. After finding secrets, obtaining weapons, and hacking away at enemys you are met with a new boss to over come. Whether it be a demon or animal, you shall overcome it.Summary: The game is with flaws but they don't detract for what you will be expirencing. You shall face the invicible and the strong but they will not stop you from fulfilling your destiny. Just don't go hollow...PvP: I left this for last because it's extremly diffrent. In human form you may summon and get invaded by people. Being human gives you no real buffs except for summons. Having humanity in your counter though can give you some buffs like loot drop chance and curse resistance. Being human is both bad and good. You can get invaded by people 10+ of your level and some below your level. Some area, like the forest, have none to little PvP restrictions, so a 150 SL and invade a 120 SL. Covenants exist to enhance the PvP like the darkmoons (Police), Darkwraith (Hunter of humanity), Gravelords (MESS YOU UPers), and Forest Hunters (Guardians of the forest). What you use in PvE is used in PvP but some weapons are better for one or the other. When it comes to weapons it's really just what you like and succeed with. The PvP is fun and fast paced but has some problems with lag and gankers (People who summon 2 people who all gang up on an invader). You will occasionally encounter some of these problems but they are few and far between.9/10			"

												I bought Dark Souls about a week ago, but I've been playing it a lot (I sometimes play in offline mode so my ingame hours won't be accurate). It's one of the best games I've ever played. Everyone talks about the difficulty, but the RPG stat system with attributes and weapon/armor stats is the best I've seen in any RPG. It is very difficult though with my special control setup, but it would be even worse with mouse and keyboard. I've heard Dark Souls 2 is playable with mouse and keyboard, but still easier with controller.I wasn't planning on getting the game mainly because of my hands, but also I wasn't sure if it would run on my PC which is why I watched Dark Souls on youtube a lot before buying it. I have had some issues with framerate, but I found out about a very popular mod called DSfix which can improve performance for low end PCs and for high end PCs it can increase framerate and improve various graphics. There's a guide on setting it up that I found helpful:


DSFIX - setup & basic configuration 
A Guide for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition
By: sajtt (╭☞ ᗒ ▾ ᗕ )╭☞

			DSFIX		


I don't know what your gaming skills are like and if you're able to use a controller so it's hard to say whether I'd recommend the game. I've heard Dark Souls 2 is easier in general (in addition to being more playable with mouse and keyboard), but it's also more expensive and there's an HD version of DS2 coming out which will be even more expensive. If you do use mouse and keyboard be prepared to change all the bindings. I hear the default bindings are terrible. Dark Souls 1 sometimes goes on sale for $5.00 so it might be better to buy that to try it out. Especially if you think you're going to want the HD version of Dark Souls 2. There is a lot of information out there to make Dark Souls easier, but if your gaming skills are truly inept (especially if you can't use controllers) then no amount of walkthroughs are going to help you. There is some spoiler free information that is useful if you don't intend on playing 100% blind (some people prefer playing 100%) blind.I don't use Dsfix because I read that the latest patches screw things up. Apparently the publisher is against it being used. It looks like there's a new update for Dsfix and it's working again. There's also a comment that says that DSfix wasn't intended to be one of the mods taken down. There is a mod that is supposed make dark souls 1 easier with a mouse and keyboardhttp://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/28/?I've been playing online partially because I didn't know how to play it offline and when I looked it up it sounded like if you do it wrong you won't be able to save. Yesterday I was getting a message that the game wasn't syncing and one of the fixes was to close the steam client which also is one way you can play offline. So that's the only way I know how. Otherwise it might involve configuring GFWL.There are advantages to playing online. One is that there are in game messages left by players that often give hints. Most are somewhat helpful, but there are a few troll messages like saying ""try jumping"" next to an edge of a cliff or fake invisible walls (there are some real ones you likely won't find without a tip unless you check every wall). Also messages saying things like ""try but hole"" or ""tongue but hole"". As you can guess there is a limited amount of words and phrases you can use to prevent things like the above.The bosses are very tough so being able to summon players is very useful for playing online. You can still sometimes summon NPCs for bosses, but only certain bosses and under certain conditions. There's also npc invaders, but they're not anywhere as tough as players. And after you beat them you're often able to summon them for bosses. Bosses do have more health if you summon someone so be aware of that.In Dark Souls (but not Dark Souls 2) you can only summon or be invaded if you're in human form so it's pretty easy to avoid invasions unless you want to do co-op. The only other time it's useful to go human is to kindle bonfires which isn't very often.			"

												Excellent game. I have enjoyed every hour (except those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ archers in Anor Londo) playing this game, almost every minute on the edge wondering what was gonna come around the next corner to take me out. I love the lore with this game in the sense you can theorize on a lot of things with other players in the community to piece the story or history behind the characters and environment. Sound is amazing with gripping parts in perfect moments and the voice actors are fantastic, especially at showing how the curse is slowly affecting them as you meet them thru the game. Graphics are not bad, especially if you do a nice mod on the textures, the game can look pretty damn amazing. Gameplay is really good as well, but i do not care for the platforming aspect of the game at all. As long as you are careful you will be ok but there will be times when you may just fall, or have some pretty terrible luck, inducing some good old fashion rage if you had a good chunk of souls or humanity on you. Spends souls wisely, but dont walk around with moneybags on your waist full of the stuff or you will seriously regret it if you die and then dont make it back to your bloodstain. This game is definitely not for everyone, and i can definitely agree as i did not care for the series at all. I am now hooked, weirdly playing them in reverse order, but still enjoying it nonetheless. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants a serious challenge with a good feeling of triumph and satisfaction when you topple that tough boss or pass thru that dungeon that handed you your♥♥♥♥♥a few times over.     Rating:   9.5/10!			"

												Definately the best RPG trilogy out there, and now that the third one is coming along with Hidetaka Miyazaki directing it. I strongly  suggest that you start your journey without spoiling yourself about literally anything!, thats the beauty of it!, going at it with barely any info on the game and you slowly start to learn and discover the world with some of the most impressive level designs I've seen. Yes you will suffer alot, but know this, there is no artificial difficulty here, simply your thinking and how you will over come the tasks ahead. Whoever says the game is too difficult are simply not playing it right, surely there are no tutorials that pop up in your face every five minutes, so you'll have to learn most of the the mechanics on your own. This game will change the way you look at bosses and how you fight them, and the euphoric moment when you overcome a boss/challenge you couldn't accomplish before is fantastic. Great gameplay mechanics and a beautiful deep story in a gorgeous world with lovely/hateful characters with their own stories to tell. 9.7/10 probably the best game I've ever played,and I don't think anything can top this series.GO ON AND PLAY IT!

												Get ready for the challenge of a lifetime. Things like slaying a demon in the abyss and fighting a horde of giants is your ordinary day with Dark Souls. Its more than an adventure. Its more than an RPG. Its a test of endurance and skill that can set any casual gamer at unease. Fear not, the game sticks to you, and you wont stop until youve beaten it. The variety of weapons and class making makes it an unique experience that you would want to repeat with different classes and weapons. The PC port is horrible and I suggest that you get an Xbox 360 controller and its adapter for PC. Trust me, it is so worth it even if you will never use that controller again. The game forces you to learn and progress, making each victory feel like an accomplishment for you. I'll give it a 9/10.			"

												Dark Souls is one of the most engaging games I've ever played.It's a dark melee focused RPG with magic elements and difficult 3rd person startegic combat.Let me start this off with stating the 'not so good' things first to leave you with a good taste in your mouth as this game is 100% worth buying.- The ""Not so Good"" elements{1} There are a few areas in the game that are not that plesant to go through at first. Once you get familair with the layout it's OK but they seem rather annoying for no real reason. There's an area that has pretty much complete darkness and if you don't have an item that creates light you're in for a bad time.Another place is rather maze-like and has annyoing enemies which shoot poison at you from afar, across bridges and plateaus. Once you know your way around the area it's not an issue and the enemies can be killed using ranged attacks (they don't respawn).{2} Another thing is that this game for PC pretty much requires 2 mods (I would say these actually are unofficial patches since they fix the game for you instead of add anything). These files are:http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix (Durante's DSfix) - this will unlock the framerate for you to 60 FPS (if you wish) and will make the scaled-up graphics look like they should have had on release.{3} The other patch i'd recommend is the DSMfix (Dark Souls Mouse fix) http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~petska/this will make your mouse movements more smooth and allows for proper manual aim with the bows. It also allows you to rebind the mouse keys.{4} The interface is very clumsy initially. You get used to it rather quickly after you've been playing for a bit but everything is kind of hidden around the whole inventory/stats UI. There's a keybind that allows you to ask for information around each element of it but that is also rather hidden :D I recommend to check out the keybind options before you start playing. Note that this is also really wierd, you get more options for the keybinds In-Game than you do at the start menu so be sure to check that out after making a character.- The 'Yay/Nah"" elementsPersonally I love these mechanics but I can understand that some people find them frustrating.(1) The game has some very confusing multiplayer aspects that require you to meet some in-game criteria in order to function.This can make it dififcult to play the game Co-Op since you must meet them.For a full read on them you can check this website: http://darksoulswiki.wikispaces.com/Online(2) There are secrets in the game that you probably wouldn't know about if you didn't read the wiki or if nobody pointed the out to you. As a result the game can seem unfair since it is already rather punishing but if you don't know where that other checkpoint is because of an invisible wall it can seem even more harsh. Luckily this is remedied in-game for the most part, since other players can leave you readable text signs on the ground to indicate 'Hey, there' a secret room here! Hit this wall!"" or ""Watch out for the trap ahead!"". They're pre-defined text messages so they can't walk you through the whole thing but they can leave nice litle clues behind for you to make things more managable.(3) The game gives you a feeling of open-world though it kind of isn't per-say. It wants you to follow a specific route in order to progress but it does so in an open environment. Sure you can go down this road but you're gonna get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by strong enemies - the upside to this is you can find better equipment in that area so if you do manage to blaze through it you'll be in a good spot for later. This also allows for a high replayabillity but i'll get to that in 'The Good' part of this review.(4) You're thrown into the world without a single damn clue - the game very much doesn't tell you jack upfront, but it tries to teach you 'the hard way'. The tutorial area already makes this apparent since it throws you into a big room with a strong guy, from which you are supposed to run away from (aka - pick your fights). It throws a trap at you that you seemingly couldn't have noticed (you could have from far away but you probably wouldn't have) which is a way of telling you to - watch out for the environment and progress slowly. I very much like this way of teaching you the game though if you don't 'get' the lesson then you're gonna be in for a hard time.- The ""Good"" elements I can write a whole blog about this but i'll stick to my top 5 or nobody is gonna read it :D[1] Every setup is viable! What I mean by this is that you're able to play this game the way YOU want, and it is going to work out. There's a great balance between difficulty for each approach. Some areas can be a bit harder if you play a light-weight fast-combat rogue-like character, but there's another area that will make things easier with that approach. Similairly if you play a pyromancer you'll get an easier start but things can be a bit more tricky in the parts where you have longer times in-between checkpoints (since your magic runs out after a few charges). The combat is awesome and versatile with every setup you play and there's litteraly a stormload of weapons, magics and gear to be found that all act in a different way. Halberd #1 can do other moves than Halberd #2. You can also upgrade your weapons and gear to make them add burn damage or lightning damage, bless them to make them holy and deal more damage to skeletons and undead or simply use that poisonous herb you found laying around to soak your blade in a temporarily poison debuff. [2] The game has amazing replayability. If you """"end"""" the game you'll go right back at it in a NG+ mode, which increases the difficulty by making enemies tougher and hit harder, but you get to keep everything you had that is not story/quest related (aka armor/weapons/magic/items). Also - you're unable to get everything in the game with just 1 playthrough, you're going to need to do multiple runs if you wish to aquire everything the game has to offer. Since the game is not linair you can simply go to a different area to start out NG+ so you won't 'run the threadmill' but get a nice change of pace.[3] The PvP in this game is godlike (even though GFWL is terrible, once it works its brilliant). It's very interesting to see the matches you get against other players that invade your world - test your combat skills against an enemy that could have done the exact same setup, but probably didn't. The PvP is unlike anything you've played before and I'd highly recommend doing it once you've had your hands on the game for a bit. Note that the PvP engagements are strangely done once more (much like every multiplayer aspect of this game - which makes it interesting) I advice you to read the dark souls wiki if you plan on going toe-to-toe with others. Or you could simply team-up with a co-op partner and play the game that way![4] The story. While it is a bit hidden and tucked away, there's so many elements that fit together if you pay attention and take an interest in what you find (read the descriptions on items, notice where you found them, notice what is around the area you found them, notice what NPC's told you about certain locations/items/people). The game very much believes you are 'part of the experience' as in -your character already knows about what's going on and as such they dont explicity tell you why certain things happen. As you play you start to realise what's going on and that feeling of being in the unknown fades slowly as you progress.[5] The community. There's a lot of people who play this game and you encounter them in different ways while you progress yourself. People will leave you clues, they might leave a summoning sign so you can summon them to your world in order to help you out with a difficult area or you could start a friendly duel with them via another summoning method.TLDR: BUY THIS GAME - IT'S AMAZING.

												One of my favorite games of all time. It doesn't hold your hand and doesn't even tell you the whole story. Through the descriptive text on items, optional dialogue with NPCs and paying attention to your surroundings, the story unfolds as much as you want it to. There are so many different ways to develop your character and various roles you can play throughout the storyline. Even the ending is fairly ambiguous. Dark Souls can be quite a challenge but every obstacle can be overcome if you pay attention to what the patterns are. Trial and error also will come into play. If you absolutely hate to lose and get enraged at not being able to figure something out you may want to skip this. But there's a certain level of satisfaction with making progress in this game and all the combat seems so real because the weapons actually appear to have weight behind them.			"

												If you have masochistic tendencies or find that your confidence in your gaming ability is just a little too high and needs a dashing, you should buy this game. If you enjoy spending hours on a character to realise you have created a terrible build and must start over from scratch, you should buy this game. If you enjoy yelling at a group of pixels on your computer and cursing Japanese game developers, you should buy this game. If you enjoy downloading half a dozen mods to make your game pretty enough to be able to even show it's face among games such as Bioshock Infinite or the Crysis series , you should buy this game. If you want to spend another $30 buying an Xbox 360 Controller to deal with the fact that this is terrible port that doesn't even explain in game keyboard and mouse controls, you should buy this game.HOWEVER...If you enjoy a sense of accomplishment when you play a game, a sense of learning, a lack of babying, some general respect from developers, and heart pounding adrenalin when you finally kill a boss after an hour and a half of consecutive tries (only to learn that this boss is ""ez-pz"" and the worst is yet to come) that you always have room to grow and room to learn, that there are dozens of different builds and play styles allowing for many hours of repeated play, you should buy this game. If you want a challenge, BUY this game. It will not be easy at first and you will die a lot (the title should give this away...) A Dark Souls veteran told me that if you realise when you die, it's because you suck and not that the game is hard, and that you must learn - it will be one of the more enjoyable and fulfilling games you can buy. If you're still not convinced like I wasn't, but it on sale. If you are a casual, do not buy this game - or do, I heard From Software feed on the tears of weak-willed gamers anyway.  "

												""Dark Souls"" is challenging yet highly rewarding when the challenges are overcome. The land of Lordran is a fantastic and beautiful world with a rich story driven by the sparse dialogue and lore hidden in item descriptions. Unfortunately, the PC version was a first attempt at PC games for From Software and, as such, a few elements suffered. The modding community made quick fixes of all the problems, however, and all are readily available at the Dark Souls Nexus. (http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/) [DSfix is a must and I highly recommend the High-Res UI and Subtitle fonts, ORIGINAL - PlayStation3 button icon textures (if you are using a PS3 controller with MotionInJoy), and Lowest Common Denominator HD Textures!]""Dark Souls"" on PC does have a problem with other players utilizing hacks and trainers as well as requiring Games for Windows Live to play online. If those two issues are a deal-breaker then pick up the PS3 version (or Xbox360 edition if you are homosexual... ""not that there's anything wrong with that"").Some people do use a mouse and keyboard to play this game, but a controller of some sort makes gameplay much better in my estimation. It is one of the few games where the mouse and keyboard really give no advantage. Xbox controllers work natively and PS3 controllers can be used via a program called MotionInJoy.Definitely one of my favorite games of the past decade; I highly recommend this game. Also, do yourself a favor and LOOK UP NOTHING. Play the game blind, at least for your first run.			"

												This game is probably on of the hardest games I've played in a while. It will make you rip your hair out and want to shut off your computer. Dark Souls forces you to pay FULL attention to everything you do in the game. Any lapse in focus will result in the loss of health, or more likely, death. Every enemy you face in the game is a challenge and requires strategy in order to beat. Luckily, you are able to summon other players in game that can help you during the harder boss fights. Unfortunately, you also open yourself up to ""Invaders"" who are players that come into your game with the sole purpose to rip you a new♥♥♥♥♥hole. I must admit, the first time it happened, I yelled at my screen ""WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN!?"", as the Invader killed me, sending me back through hours of work... but I digress. The enemy designs in this game are a breath of fresh air and a great change of pace. There are so many different enemy designs which are memorable and inspired. Another thing I love about Dark Souls, is the level of free reign and depth to the game. There are many different side quests which you can follow instead of following the main story line. The combat system in the game is very fun, yet difficult, to use. There are enough different weapons in the game to make your head spin. From claymores to halbreds, or even a pretty in depth magic system, you can pretty much get through the game with almost any weapon you want. It's not so much the power of the weapon, but the skill level of your character and the skill level of the gamer. You can have a huge♥♥♥♥♥sword with 900 power, but if your hero has the strenth of a 5-year-old, your hero will stumble as they try to swing the weapon.Dark Souls is by far one of my favorite games of all time. All of the different systems, weapons, and enemies, will make any playthrough fun and enjoyable. It also doesn't hold your hand like many games today. It drops you into hell and says ""Do it ♥♥♥♥♥!"", forcing you to learn and become good at the game by yourself. I'd DEFINITELY recomend this game. 9/10~~~NOTE~~~~~- An Xbox game pad or equivalent is basically a MUST- Download the graphical patches for PC to get the most out of the graphics			"

You will find your progress so rewarding since you will be playing one of the hardest games of this generation. And once you finally finish the game you'll just want to do it over and over. Multiplayer could be better but is still very fun. Co-op with your friends or PVPing around. So much fun, best game I've ever bought.			"

												DARK SOULS PREPARE TO DIE	this game right here, is a work of art and beauty, in both terms of gameplay and atmosphere of the world, after owning a total of 3 copies of the game, multiple playthroughs and spending a combined time of 532 hours on it (80 something on PC and 452 on PS3) I finally feel confident to sum up my oppinions and explain why you should play Dark Souls.you play as the chosen undead, the warrior with enougth courage, determination and skill to bring an end to the curse of the undead, as the chosen undead you will travel the dark, teryfying landscapes of Lordran, you will fight deamons and monsters that will decorate your very nightmares, you will face chalenges that will seem imposible, but you will eventually suceed and the sense of acomplishment that you will feel is greater than that of any other game I've ever played. People often mistakenly criticize or praise Dark Souls for how difficult it is, and they are right the first time you play Dark Souls it is difficult, assuming your not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥noob using a guide. but the game makes you learn from your mistakes, you get eaten by a treasure chest, you go back to the chest and beat the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it with your sword. like batman's father said ""why do we fall down? so that we can learn to pick ourselves up"" and that sums up the dificulty of Dark Souls, but still there are some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments where the game kills you and you have no idea that was going to happen unless you already know (seath the scaless, I'm talking about you)now the gameplay of Dark Souls is probably my favourite aspect of the game, depending on your choices of gear the game plays out incredibly differently. for instance a big strong warrior clad in huge metal armour and weilding a sword that makes giants soil themselves, is going to feel like a tank, it's strong, it can take a hell of a lot of hits but it's slow, susceptical to backstabs and ripostes. whilst a warrior wearing light armour and wielding a rapier or a dagger etc, is able to flip around the battlefield avoiding getting hit as well as dealing major damage due to back stabs.and all that is just a fraction of what you can create yourself to be, I haven't even covered sorceries, pyromancies, miracles.the great thing about the gameplay is that it's fun, it can be frustrating as hell at times, and people who view bigger numbers as better are gonna have a hard time, you have to build a character that you enjoy playing, with a move set you enjoy. for instance my current build utilizes the Black Knight Great Axe (BKGA) the BKGA does a hell of a lot of damage and can kill almost everything in a couple of swings, but it's heavy, really really heavy. so I combine the axe with some decent armour that has great defence to weight ratio and use a few rings to make my character have a higher equip load and then I'm able to move fast and strike hard, this however can be dangerous because I'm classed as a ""glass cannon"" I do a lot of damage but I will most likely die if I mess up, so you can see the posibilities Dark Souls has for PvP, PvP can be extremely fun and chalenging when it works, there are quite a lot of hackers online and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of plebs with no skill that rely on tactics such as 3 vs 1. another problem with Dark Souls PvP is that the net code that from uses is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and games for windows live is the worst atrocity I've ever had the privelage to use. to fix from softwares horible coding I heavilly and highly recomend you install both DSFIX and DSCFIX (both of which can be found on the Dark Souls Nexus) both of those mods will fix a lot of problems with Dark Souls.now moving away from PvP I'd like to tell you how great the enviroments for Dark Souls are, the Art Direction for the game is phenomonal, granted the graphics aren't the greatest but by god the Art Direction is almost godly, every area feels diffrent and unique, every area has a diffrent tone and presents you with different obstacles.take the undead asylum (the area you first start in) the asylum has a sense of decay and looks ruined as you walk down the first corridor, you see the tortured minds of the undead around you, they see you as another poor soul trapped for eternity, but your quest has only just beguna good contrast to the asylum is the forest (Dark Wood something I think) the forrest is filled with mystery and danger, at any second a plant like monster can spurt out of the ground and destroy you. the atmospere of the forest is cold and dark with many ledges and many traps.the music is also very eerie at times and adds imensly to the game, it's the sort of soundtrack that fits in so well with the game you forget it's even there, boss fights sound epic and dangerous and exploring feels unsafe and eerieAll in All I highly recomend Dark Souls to everyone, it is by far one of if not my favourite game of the last generation, it has endless fun and a lot of great experiences, the game presents a chalenge and in this day and age of gaming that is very welcome. I will stress that the game does require a game pad, even with all the fixes it still feels horible with keyboard and mouse, I can't wait for Dark Souls 2. so go and buy it and Prepare to die.10/10 pretty gudP.S don't be a ♥♥♥♥♥ and use a guide,P.S.S the drake sword is for the ♥♥♥♥♥es ♥♥♥♥♥(no spell check on steam, don't know if I spelt everything right)			"

												Dark Souls is an amazing game orginally released for the PS3 and Xbox 360. This port includes the Artorias of the Abyss DLC released later for console versions. Its an action adventure/RPG with a cruel difficulty for new players.That being said, this game is one of my all time favorite games, its challenging but not unfair as you will die and learn from your mistakes. Once you learn the mechanics and controls well enough the game is only moderately difficult but almost never easy. The PC version has some drawbacks, being that you have to download DSFix in order to change the resolution of the game. This game is also strongly recommended with a game pad or Xbox 360 controller.Despite the few flaws in the game, its definately a favorite, and I for one cannot wait for Dark Souls II in March!I give this game 9/10 potato chips!

												I noticed I haven't recommended this game on steam, not outright anyway. The hours I've put into this and Demon's Souls speak greater volumes than I could put into words. This game is good. Really good. It's six dollars right now. 6. Dollars. That's a lot of money you just saved from not buying Battleduty 9, you filthy casual. Play this game, git gud, and then play it again.  No other game has captured my attention and put me in such a permanent state of wonderment before. Dark Souls™: Prepare To Cry™ Edition by From Software® is a masterpiece of vidya game design. 'Cept fist weapons, spears, the dark wood grain ring, Wrath of the Gods, the Falchion, Anal Rodeo, and divine blessings, cheat engine, reddit, and gankers. For real tho, play it. Right now.

												If I had to describe Dark Souls in 1 word it would most likely be ""rewarding"". Beating a single enemy in a game has never felt as great as it did in Dark Souls. The game is hard, unforgiving and at some parts just unfair. But why do people, including myself, still love this game? The answer is that every step, every kill, every boss you take on feels incredibly rewarding once you make it and like something you really worked for to achieve. And this is a feeling that no Skyrim, no Risen 2 or any other game can give you. This combined with the great and challenging Battle system makes for a fantastic experience once one got the hang of it. The only thing one has to keep in mind is that this game can be frustrating, due to the really poor porting on PC. I highly recommend checking for community patches before playing and never ever use keyboard and mouse. This game needs a controller to be played. If you are willing to dig into a deep and dark world full of dangers, then Dark Souls is the game for you.			"

												there has never been a more accuarate titel for a game, than ""prepare to die"" for dark souls. this game is unforgiving, cruel and i guarantee you, you will have times, when you want to throw your pc against a wall. but it is also the most rewarding game i ever played. this brief moment after you beat a boss, that whiped you numerous times, is better than having sex. trust me. i had sex once!there are a couple of issues. it is possible to play it with keyboard and mouse, but it requires a bit of tweaking. you need external programs to get it running, but once you got them, it is absolutely playable. of course you could still use a controller, that is fully supported.the atmosphere of dark souls is great, the combat is great, the world is great. the only thing i didnt find quite satisfying is the pvp aspect of the game. but the single player component is one of the best i ever played. don't confuse this game with a hack and slay like diablo. every combat requires a certain tactic, especially the bossfights, wich are tough, tough, tough. but even the trashmobs are always dangerous. so buy this game and prepare to die. you will die a lot. i promise.

												I can't even begin to describe how good this game is, but, i'll try.Basically, it has everything a gamer could possibly want:-It's challenging to the point of frustration (which only makes winning more satisfying)-It has a large array of gear and loot to keep the collectors and completionists busy for a long while-It has a very in depth, delicate and extremely profound and complicated storyline and lore-Your character has a number of different attributes with a number of different combat paths to take-The combat system is one of the best i've seen in a long while, and while it is hard it is very fun to learn-Almost every weapon has its own unique fighting style-It has Co-op-It has PvP-It has Shops and NPC's and sub-plots of different characters woven into the main storyAll in all, this game is almost flawless. But be warned, the learning curve for the first 10 or so hours of gameplay can be unforgiving, so if you do intend on playing this game, make sure that you have cleared your calendar so you can get to the more enjoyable parts of the game. And if you get stuck, try to think outside the box, or just look it up. Some parts are so complex you can be left wondering how anyone ever figured them out at all. It's small wonder that this game was put in the top 20 games ever. I would recommend that everyone play at least the first 3 or 4 bosses of this game to get the true feel of it. It is utterly fantastic.Also, if you figure out how, SAVE SOLAIRE. He is a true bro.			"

												This review is written for people who have played the original for PS3/ XBOX, and are thinking about conquering it for PC as well.----------------------------------------------------->I have recently completed over 100 hours on this version, and I had a blast. After programming the DSFix mod (which you will need, and it's easy to do), the game opened up a whole new volley of excitement for me. At 55 FPS I felt like Neo at the end of the first Matrix, just owning everything I came across. So if your coming over from PS3 or XBOX; Parry, Repost, and Back Stabs are much easier at 55 fps... and Blight Town can actually be appreciated.The downside is that the community is smaller, so there isn't as much activity in the multiplayer aspect. Also, with GFWL shutting down soon, Dark Souls ""may"" become a single player experience. Which will not be so bad for new comers, but for the veterans... that will be most unpleasant. However for now you can use DSCFix, which makes it easier to connect to people.Important NOTES: From ""my"" experience, the DSFix mod does not help for PCs using native graphics. You need a dedicated GPU, and or video card. I shelled out $150 on my NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650, and it runs so smooth. You Will Need-------------------------------------->A game controler (360 or equivelent)DSFix For frame rate and other graphical settingshttp://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?DSCFix For online conectivity with other playershttp://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/334/?----------------------------------------------------------->A Note On My credability: I have already scored 400+ hours, and aquired the platinum for the PS3 version of Dark Souls before playing the PC version, (PSN: Liam_Eibach).

This game is worth the challenge, once you make it past the dreaded Blighttown, you can expect to be pulled in. To quote a review, ""Its like walking blindly into a shed full of rakes, getting hit in the face repeatedly. You back off for a while, and then you go back for more, untill you find yourself raking all day long."" If you decide to pick up the game, jolly cooperation, and praise the sun!			"

												Dark Souls is an experience missing in most current games. Most likely one of the few things you will have heard about the game is that it is difficult and that you will die. While this is true, it does so for a greater purpose than difficulty’s sake. The story and the world end up being the something that is hard to find elsewhere, and this is reinforced by the difficulty. It is one of a few games where the narrative and the game mechanics work in tandem to create an overall more full experience. If you want a game to treat you like an adult and show a different take on games, than dark souls is worth trying.			"

												Don't let the ""Dark Souls is hard"" hype scare you away. There's a few different types of difficulty in games: the kind that tests your skill and dexterity with the controller, the kind that tests your brain and makes you figure things out, and the ""arcade hard"" that just screws you over randomly and takes your money. Dark Souls is the perfect balance of all three, so even if you're not very good at hard games (like me), the design and balance makes it accessible to anyone who's willing to get in the right ""mode"" and put in the effort.Every combat encounter requires some strategizing, some practice, and a little bit of luck. It is punishing, you lose ""souls"" and ""humanity"" whenever you die, but you do have a chance to get it back, and if it's gone forever, it's not the end of the world. Just accept your losses and, if you can't bring yourself to try that path again, there's usually some other nook to explore in this game's well-designed and wonderful looking world. And stuff will occasionally come out of nowhere and kill you randomly, which if you're in the right mindset just makes the game more hilarious and enjoyable.This game is well worth playing. If you're willing to take it slow, learn the tricks, and trudge your way through, you'll discover a varied and wonderful-looking world with many excellent surprises, some of which throw you off a cliff.

For almost every enemy u require a skill and particular strategy. U got to understand there attack pattern and all other things and after u adopt to gameplay thers another thing yes it got amazing STORY. You gotta speculate theory about the game story on urself with piecing together fragments of info by talking to NPC, reading item description etc. For almost perfect story speculation u may check youtube and search for Dark souls lore (ENB rcommended).Well just dont quit try to understand where u failing keep on going once u complete the game its not the casual feeling u get from completing a regular game its extraordinary listening to lore of ending u may get shocked too.So for all the gamers out there if u dont try this one then u r missing a very extraordinay game and its ur loss afterall.Praise The Sun.

												Dark Souls is an action RPG that originally came out on the PS3 back in 2011 and later ported to PC. In order to get the best experience out of it you'll need to get DSfix and use that (nexus mods has it or just google it). You'll also need a controller. Keyboard & Mouse controls are absolute garbage and even customizing them is worthless.  It's a game that's most famous for it's challenge, although fair, takes skill and trial & error to complete. There's many different playstyles to start from, Warrior, Pyromancer, Sorceror, Cleric etc. With all types of weapons ranging from swords, clubs, hammers, axes, spells, bows, crossbows and so on. As you progress in the game you will find bonfires that you can use to level up your character with souls collected from fallen foes. Bonfires are by far the most useful object in the game. They're needed to repair weapons & armor, store your items, level up and eventually fast travel. Everytime you use a bonfire though all the enemies (except bosses and important monsters) will respawn which means you'll have to plan your route and battle strategy accordingly since distance between bonfires can be quite far.It's not a game I'd call frustratingly hard but it is fair and will punish you for every mistake. Every encounter serves a purpose and the level design which at times can be a bit confusing but still brilliantly constructed to tie the world together is one of my favorite things about the game. The story isn't straightforward and the world building & lore is done mostly through reading item descriptions. If you head into a direction and the enemies totally destroy you, that's the game's way of telling you not to go that way yet.All in all, this game is one of my favorites. Get Dark Souls. Get good.

												Reviewing this game purely on it's merits as a game and not a PC port, it's fantastic, easily one of my favorite games of all time, possibly my favorite RPG of all time. With one of the best combat systems of any game, you make a mistake, you'll probably end up dying, it's extremely punishing and thus not for everyone but if you put in the time it's VERY rewarding.The world and level design is in my opinion unmatched in any RPG, there's all sorts of secrets to be found in the game by jumping from ledges and rolling onto different platforms to get to secret areas, the game is rife with secrets.The story is incredibly deep, complex and compelling but is told subtly in item descriptions, random observations around the world and NPC dialogue.PvP is great fun but likely will be laggy, it's entirely optional, as is CO-OP, some people love to play the game with friends, some love to solo it, I'm in the latter category but there is something here for everyone.The enemy design and voice acting are top notch, I honestly cannot say enough good things about this game, but I stress, if you do not enjoy a challenge (that's fine) then Dark Souls is likely not for you, oh, and the PC port is a barebones straight console port, but is easily fixed by using Durante's ""DSFix"" Mod.In my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made.

												Dark Souls is definitely a game of great difficulty for a player who is not well prepared or familiar with the game. The game offers a very interesting storyline packed with lore and incredible detail as well as an addictive urge to come back for more. In all likelihood, most of your first playthrough of the game will be spent learning and questioning where you have gone wrong but usually its the simple mistakes the game tricks you into making.  Majority of the time will also be spent screaming and raging at the countless amount of deaths you'll be facing, as death is inevitable with this game (YOU DIED). Dark Souls becomes less difficult once you become familiar with the games concept, item locations and build combinations. Either way it will always provide you with a decent challenge so dont expect any less! The game was created as a masterpiece overall and it deserves all the praise and reputation it has. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who awaits a challenge, loves a story driven adventure and has the time to sink a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of hours into it!Dark Souls 1 in my opinion is the best of the the 3 due to its amazing lore, gameplay and the land of Lordran as its simply stunning. Also mentioning the amazing DLC which easily stands out as the best dlc of the franchise. Out of the 3 it is the game i can get to ng ++++ and still look forward to more and more gameplay. Bandai Namco should be proud of what they created because i know i am as well as thousands of others.   I give the game a 9.9 out of 10 for all reasons listed above, so dont hesitate to buy it! Oh and dont forget to always praise the sun!			"

												There really isn't a game like Dark Souls. It takes (mostly) melee combat and makes it its central piece. It's visceral, it requires careful timing and quick thinking from the player. Landing hits is oh so satisfying. Knowing when to block, dodge or attack is paramount, as a few, unforgiving (but often well-deserved) hits are all that separates the chosen undead from killing an enemy to having to restart from the checkpoint and risking losing all their souls (in-game currency), as they'll disappear from your death spot if you don't pick them up before dying again. Tension buildup is inevitable when you're exploring a new area or trying not to die to recover your 100000+ souls you dropped on your last death. This is the same reason why slaying bosses tastes so much sweeter than in any other game, since there's so much at stake. Multiplayer is also a strong component of the game, in which through diverse items and covenants you can invade (enter someone else’s game) another chosen undead and either help him get through an area and slay the boss or simply engage the invaded player and take his souls and humanity. Again, this plays very well into the whole tension-buildup setup the game goes for. No game is perfect, and Dark Souls does have a few issues: On the game side, the second half of the game (approximately) feels unfinished and rushed, with uninspired areas and bosses; the game’s leveling system lets players with high-end gear invade new players who are in the starting areas, which makes an unfair fight (but really, who hasn’t given in to becoming a level 1 darkwraith?). Technically, this is one of the worst console ports ever made, with locked in-game resolution and framerate (which can be solved with 3rd party patches like dsfix); and of course the networking code, invasions are based on a peer-to-peer system, so running into laggers is inevitable (that is if you manage to invade/get invaded in the first place, since Games For Windows Live does far more harm than good, requiring fiddling with router ports and more 3rd party patches like dscfix). At the end of the day, if you give the game and chance, it will “click” with you, and then you’ll become another victim from the dark curse, discussing and planning character builds and thinking why most other melee-focused combat games just don’t feel right anymore.

using a controller with this game is highly recommendedPros:+ Excellent level design and overall atmosphere+ Loads of weapons, armors and items+ Simple yet deep combat system+ Deep, interesting lore (usually given by snippets of dialogue from NPCs or item descriptions)+ Challenging without being too unfair; which, for the most part, can lead to a great sense of accomplishment+ Leveling up one stat at a time (that affect Health, Stamina, Strength and so on) allows for a deep character customization, and along with a NG+ feature, ultimately welcomes multiple playthroughsMiddle Ground:~ Optimization: I'm placing this as a middle ground simply because it is difficult for me to blame FromSoftware for this port, or even have that much to complain about in all honesty.  If you are someone who cannot stand playing a game at 30fps (even if the game is designed around that framerate) or prefer to have a higher resolution experience, or even perhaps just want to tweak with some of the in-game effects, you'll want to Google search something called DSfix.Cons:- Matchmaking: (I suppose this could be linked to optimization as well, yet I am unsure if the console versions of this title use the same method) - I rarely was able to spot a player phantom sign during my first playthrough; in fact, most of that time the servers were not working at all.  So aside from a few NPC summons here and there for boss fights I rarely had the chance to play with other people (that includes invaders).  This personally is not a deal breaker for me as I enjoyed my time nonetheless, however, many gamers nowadays tend to be turned off if a game like this doesn't include proper multiplayer features.  I believe there is a program that improves the matchmaking experience - using your favorite search engine can lead you to the ""fix"" if you're willing to try it out.Conclusion:It's fairly difficult for me to find many faults with this game as I have only played through it once so far, along with messing around with a couple of different early game builds.  I'm probably what this community would call a ""filthy casual"" as I am not a walking encyclopedia of every aspect of the game's mechanics, so, again, it's hard for me to critique something I'm not yet aware of.  All I can say is, even with this title's downfalls, I very much enjoyed my time in Lordran and still to this day do not regret spending the current full price ($20) on what will probably go down as one of the greatest Action-RPG pinnacles of gaming history.

												(I'm largely going to skip the talk about GFWL (Games for Windows Live) and the required mods due to cruddy porting. Yes, GFWL is bad. Yes, it has just been replaced (Woo!). Yes, the porting is bad. Yes, it is entirely negligible with the DSfix and even made 100% playable with keyboard and mouse with DSmfix (setups which I'd be right happy to share.)I will probably have to start this review off by saying what everyone says; yes, this game is hard, and it will undoubtedly test you if you're new to the series.However, it will also reward you and your skill (or your exploring), over and over if you're willing to press on, not just with shiny items or souls, but also sometimes with breathtaking atmosphere, stunning landscape views (which in 99% of the cases, are places you'll end up later on, the level design is genius) and heaps of lore if you're into that sort of thing. Even I, who is 450 hours in, and now pushing for 100% completion, get well rewarded for some of the things I go through.Now, after all these hours, I know I can't say this game is completely flawless (aside from GFWL and port issues). I know the flaws. I've seen the flaws. I've talked to parts of the community about the flaws. But I did not see them the first playthrough, or the second, probably not before the third time or so, and honestly I'd say that's a lot better than most games still.I'd like to say that Dark Souls is a rather lonely experience and I'll suggest it should be played as such, at least the first playthrough. In my opinion this contributes to making some of the encounters more atmospheric, more lively, more depressive.As a last word, I wholeheartedly recommend this game, for there are few like it, and hopefully someone dare take the step to try it and falls as much in love with it as I have.

It never really feels over, and as such has near infinite replayability, bringing me back for more time and again.  It's a good game, but certainly not for everyone.  I would recommend this to anyone who is patient enough to learn how the game works and is willing to die many times through the process.  Prepare to Die, and enjoy!			"

												This game is gorgeous I fell in love with this game first time when I saw a trailer, where giant phantasmagoric wolf jumped out from the woods and started to swing with a bigass sword holding it with his chops. I extremely like the aesterics of the game, its style, the story of the world and its inhabitants and the approach to storytelling, the very feel of this beautiful game.I was eager to play it for the very long time, but ""experts"" was yelling on their forums and streams: ""playing on keyboard and mouse is the pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is unplayable"", and great amount of time has past before I decided to try it out anyways. And guess what - playing with mouse not only adequate, but quite comfy. The only problem is the camera sencetivity, which is easely fixed.So if you dont have (or dont want to use) controller and doubting about buying this game for this reason, I assure you, keyboard+mouse is fine.And I definitely can recomend to try this game out. It worth it.			"

Theres nothing else I've played that ever gave the sense of satisfaction as I have with Dark Souls. I would recommend going in not knowing anything and trying to figure it out on your own.

												Words connot describe the experience of playing this game. Once you get past the steep learning curve and begin to grasp the basics, you simply cannot put it down. Although very difficult, after every boss attempt there remains a feeling of ""ONE MORE TRY"", and this turns into countless failed attempts that make or break the player. However, the satisfaction of boss kills is something that i have never experienced in a game before. This is game that takes many tries to get into, myself being three, but i could not be happier that i decided to pick it up and give it another shot. Arguably my favorite game ever and i eagerly await Dark Souls 2. 10/10!			"

												I simply cannot recommend this game enough.It's a refreshing take on the RPG genre. It doesn't hold your hand through anything. The story flows organically through dialog with no quest markers or logs - just the player and the world, which can be traversed from top to bottom.The difficulty is not artificial in any way; it is simply what you make of it. Learn the mechanics, master them and you will get the most satisfying gameplay experience you've had in a long time. Boss fights are just challenging enough to truly make you feel like you've earned the victory and make it that much sweeter when it comes.The multiplayer component is seamlessly weaved into the single player experience, something more and more games have been doing ever since Dark Souls proved it to be quite the viable mechanic. 10/10 would die again!

There are moments when you will be tempted to break everything around you in a fit of rage. This is normal. The PvE is pretty good, but the PvP is what can keep a person playing, as the community is still alive and running. If you can't afford Dark Souls 2, you should definitely get Dark Souls 1.

												Generally, I play games on normal difficulty. Sometimes I drop it down to easy, because I'm a filthy casual. I didn't think I'd enjoy this game but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I started.The world is beautiful (once you get DSfix) in a run down way. It starts out with fairly typical undead ruins but gets weirder from there. The lore is largely unspoken, it is relayed through descriptions on items and how the world works. This is similar to the database in the first Mass Effect and I love it here just as much.The gameplay is tough. My first learning experience was near the start of the game. I had amassed a sizable amount of Humanity (a resource used in the game for various things) and because it increases item find I thought it'd be good to use it all. This means that I could lose it if I died, but I figured I'd have no problem getting to my bloodstain (which restores your lost Humanity and Souls). Then I met the first boss. He killed me. A lot. And then I died on the way back before I could get my bloodstain. All those Souls and Humanity - gone. I got mad. I stopped playing for the night. But I came back with an altered mindset: the only thing you lose by dying is whatever you choose to risk. Once I got into that mindset death doesn't bother me as much, although I am still cautious. I can see the effects of getting better at the game mechanics. I can see the benefit of my improved arms and armor. I ""broke through the wall"".It was worth it.			"

												Dark Souls is widly known as a game that causes undying rage in many of its players as well as being an awful pc port. These may be true, however there are allot of things that the people who dont play it because of this lose out on. Dark Souls is an incredible game overall. The story is amazingly deep and with all of the lore that exists in the game, it creates a world that you truly feel has existed long before you came around and long after you leave. Every character that you see on screen and even allot that you don't see on screen. All have huge impacts on the world around you and allot of people overlook this because of the games dificulty. For example you could find a body with some armor on it and not think twice. But if you look into it more you may find that the person who's armor it was had a huge impact on where you are and where the world is now and you had the misfortune/fortune to run into their grave.The gameplay itself works smoothly enough though a controller is strongly reccommended because of the pc ported controls being bad and not well explained. Most all of the movements in the game are very smooth, everything from parries to backstabs are all pleasing to the eye as well as very satisfying when you land them. You will die allot in this game, thats a given and something even mentioned in the title ""Prepare to Die"". But the greatest part of this game and why I personally find the dieing acceptable is because of the sense of acomplisment you get when you succeed. Killing a boss in this game is more than something you can just shrug off, its a huge acomplisment to kill a boss after dieing to it ten times before. To finally see on the screen ""Boss Defeated"" is a huge thing and can bring giant smiles and cheers to some. The sheer acomplisment alone makes this game worth while. The entire way you craft your character is very different to normal rpg's. You start with the regular builds, but as you go through the game your able to work towards whatever you want. You can start out a mage and end as a tank with the heaviest weapons and armor in the game if you'd like. This ""Class system"" makes gameplay allot different from other rpg's. Even better in my opinion is the opressive feeling you get when you have allot of souls (The ingame xp and currency) and are walking back to a bonfire, anything can happen and it gives you a very nervous feeling because you just killed a boss to get all of these and you dont want to lose them to a small enemy before you get to use them. So the atmosphere can change rapidly, and because of the soul system allot of people get turned off because that is what is rage inducing about the game. But getting past it makes you feel like you have truly acomplished something.As far as multiplayer however this game comes up a little short. The ability to see other people as translucient phantoms is amazing, getting to see the blood stains of other players in real time and seeing how they died is great. Or even sitting at a bonfire and seeing someone else sitting with you is good because it all makes you feel much less alone and lets you know others are going through what you are too. As far as the match making system for the party and invasions system is concerned however is another story. If you were hoping to co-op with a friend in this game, you will have a rough time. The game uses a peer to peer match making system which is a little flawed because of the time it can take for you to see a friends summon sign. Even more annoying can be the invasion system which allows others to invade your world when you are a human and slay you for your souls and humanity. Because you need to be human to summon others into your world for the boss fights, this can clash against the invasion system and allot of the time you will get invaded before you can even see your friends summon sign to bring them to your world.Overall this game is extremely well thought out in lore, setting a perfectly dark tone which suits the game and the atmosphere. The way the game has you interacting with other players is creative and inovative but the co-op aspect is slightly lacking. The Third Person RPG style gameplay is amazing and will keep you coming back for more every time along with the amazing boss fights (Save for 2 of them) that make you feel great when you finally defeat them. This is an amazing game which allot of people pass up for fear of its reputation as either a bad port or as a terribly difficult game. But, id reccomend this game to anyone who likes dark and very deep story lines, the very strong gameplay and ""Class system"" or lack there of and who want a little more challenge than the average game. Personally I give dark souls a 10/10 but that could be just me.			"

This game puts fresh spins on mechanics that went out of style 10-15 years ago and puts them at the core of its gameplay.  Every enemy is a threat, bosses will brutalize you until you figure them out, there's zero hand-holding, and dying hurts.  And you will die.  A lot, actually.And it's awesome.

												A modern day masterpiece.Im not new to the series having previously done everything possible in Demon Souls....I'd went several NG+ deep, held every weapon, reached well in excess of SL250 and farmed souls to the point where losing 4 million souls meant absolutely nothing, all as part of a 15-20 hour search just for the ever elusive Pure Bladestone. Dark Souls does everything Demon Souls did but on a grander scale. The nexus is a thing of the past with more traditional progression through the area making it feel more like a world than a series of selectable areas / levels. There's a heavy covenant theme throughout the game, many are easily missable as there well off the beaten track. There are NPCs which will sporadically pop up during your playthrough provided you fulfill very specific conditions and for the most part meet them at a set point during progression through the game.What is retained is the outstanding sense of atmosphere. Blighttown & The Depths are Dark Souls equivalent of the Valley of Defilement from Demon Souls, an area where early game you'll spend most of your time either poisoned, toxic, cursed or all three. Tomb of the Giants with its almost complete darkness hiding oversized skeletons up until the point where they attack, Darkroot Basin & Darkroot Garden with Alvina the Forest Covenant leader looking like a nod to something from Alice in Wonderland. The Crystal Cave, Demon Ruins, Lost Izalith, The Catacombs, The Painted World of Ariamis, Anor Londo....there all fantastic, so unique and defined in the game world with completely unforgettable mini bosses / bosses.The gameplay mechanics are generally as was in Demon Souls, load created by equipped items and stamina / strength stats still play a huge part, go over 50% and you fat roll, go even higher and your character will just squirm on the spot when you tap roll, mobility as before is key. If you can get to them the game throws high level armour sets and weapons at you very early on, there so high though you're unable to use them effectively. During my initial playthrough I fealt like I barely scratched the game, I used several weapons out of more than likely 50+ which reside in my inventory, used 3 or 4 armour sets, used 3 or 4 rings predominantly chosen specifically for boss fights or locations. I believe I used one spell out of a vast amount, that being Iron Flesh to tank the Sanctuary Garden boss - the scope to play the game in your own way is almost overwhelming.To touch on the multiplayer, its still active, people still drop the old troll signs telling you to jump off cliff faces to fantastic treasure etc, for the best example of how unique the multiplayer is googling ""Dark Souls The Wall"" leaves nothing to the imagination.Very few games nowadays keep me compelled to the point where I can't put them down, Dark Souls is one of them.

												BEST GAME EVERI own this game on Xbox360, and have beaten it more times than I could keep track of. I died more times than I could count. This game went from, one of THE most frustrating experiences in my life. To one of the most rewarding experiences. I think I purchased it a couple (2) of years after it came out. Now you could watch a bunch of YouTube videos. However it took me years of grueling and triumphant effort to master this game.Although I own Demon's Souls (PS3), Dark Souls II (360, PC), Scholar of the First Sin (PC), Bloodborne (PS4), and Dark Souls III (PS4,PC)....I cannot stop playing the first ""Dark Souls"". Years later and I am playing like it's an addiction.I paid $15 to the expansion content on console. Yet I picked up this Steam version, with DLC. For like $2.99. This was even after a sale I missed. I was crushed. The price then, was $4.99. Even at what, 20 bucks? This game is a STEAL.Casual gamers; this game IS for you, because you deserve the aggravation. Hardcore gamers already know about this game and don't need to be sold on the value.Not only is the story a mystery, but the lore is a matter of opinion. You MUST read item descriptions, talk to anyone that will speak, and play through to decide for yourself. Will you follow the Sun, link the Bonfires, become a Darkwraith, or simply become Crestfallen....and give up.Ah haha haha Ha hahahaCome on then. It's only a game, and it won't be THAT difficult for you. Will it!?			"

												Words connot describe the experience of playing this game. Once you get past the steep learning curve and begin to grasp the basics, you simply cannot put it down. Although very difficult, after every boss attempt there remains a feeling of ""ONE MORE TRY"", and this turns into countless failed attempts that make or break the player. However, the satisfaction of boss kills is something that i have never experienced in a game before. This is game that takes many tries to get into, myself being three, but i could not be happier that i decided to pick it up and give it another shot. Arguably my favorite game ever and i eagerly await Dark Souls 2. 10/10!			"

												Its more fair than real life.Seriously tho. If you find modern day AAA games to be a cakewalk at default and padded with artificial difficulty at higher levels (bullet sponges, 2 hit kills.... you name it) then you will like this game. It doesnt BS you with some fake difficulty and catapults you into the game world whose history you will likely not understand until NG+2.GameplayDont get the wrong impression and run away now though. The actual PvE combat mechanics is very well balanced. The mobs will die few whacks and so will you. So once you learn the mechanics and patterns of the enemies. The game becomes considerably easier to manage and you'll likely not die at all provided you're careful.The area can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to navigate and there's hidden nooks and crannies(ph4tloots included) everywhere.So its a nightmare for the forgetful gamer. Getting lost mid-map is mandatory. You might wanna skip to a guide if you dont really have the time. I cant say much about the PVP but be prepared to face laggers and cheap strat ""meta"" no lifers taunt-after-every-killers. The connection is P2P. Theres no dedicated server. (more lag yaayyyyy)[PC Port troubles]What can I say? This is a console game ported to PC by popular demand so the interface sucks big goblin donger and gets crammy really quick. The default mouse+kb control is unusable(mod fix) If you want to play at 60fps 1080p you will also need to dl a mod.In the end you will get frustrated. You will forget that frustration once you rekt that a-hole boss after 10 deaths. You will get frustrated again...etc...But is the feeling at the end worth? DefinitelyPraise/10 "

												I simply cannot recommend this game enough.It's a refreshing take on the RPG genre. It doesn't hold your hand through anything. The story flows organically through dialog with no quest markers or logs - just the player and the world, which can be traversed from top to bottom.The difficulty is not artificial in any way; it is simply what you make of it. Learn the mechanics, master them and you will get the most satisfying gameplay experience you've had in a long time. Boss fights are just challenging enough to truly make you feel like you've earned the victory and make it that much sweeter when it comes.The multiplayer component is seamlessly weaved into the single player experience, something more and more games have been doing ever since Dark Souls proved it to be quite the viable mechanic. 10/10 would die again!

												Now, let's just preface this with the obvious.You'll die. A lot. Okay, now with the obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥done and dusted, this game is a masterpiece. The way the lore is (or rather, isn't) told, the combat mechanics forcing you to adapt and reflect on each and every death, the at times skeletal but driving soundtrack, it all fits together like a well-crafted jigsaw. Add to that the massive scale of the replayability be it via NG+ or a new build, and the graphics (which are very pleasing even for an 'older' game) being what they are, this game is a solid rec in my opinion. Finally I'd like to add that the online playerbase is thriving still. It's not as active as DS3 per se but considering that at this point in time we've already got two sequels, the fact that people are still regularly engaging in jolly cooperation is heartwarming.Now to be fair, the game is far from perfect. The later areas suffer from either dips in budget, time or creativity, a prime example being the bed of chaos. Or as the community's dubbed it, the bed of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Some parts of the game feel barren, and a few of the bosses really could have benefited from some extra zest to them. However, this is just nitpicking.All in all this game is sure to keep you entertained and challenged, from the moment ms big booty jumps you until the point where you beat old ashbeard.P.S.: don't skip out on the DLC, it contains some of the best boss battles and scenery in the game.P.P.S.: don't level RES. Just don't.P.P.P.S.: \[T]/ praise the sun \[T]/			"

												Throw everything you know about RPGs away, and step into a hardcore dark fantasy adventure rich with hidden lore and great boss battles. You walk alone most of your journey until you find the occasional interactive NPC and have their own backstory and reason for being in the god forsaken land of Lordran, only knowing you have to re-kindle the flame, or die trying... Over and over again.Been a long time Dark Souls fan, came for the PvE and stayed for the PvP.The game has noticable issues, but you can easily get past them once you know, player to player connectivity is not perfect, but once you get ip addressess you'll be golden.But anyway, have fun and don't you dare go hollow.

												Dark Souls is an action RPG that originally came out on the PS3 back in 2011 and later ported to PC. In order to get the best experience out of it you'll need to get DSfix and use that (nexus mods has it or just google it). You'll also need a controller. Keyboard & Mouse controls are absolute garbage and even customizing them is worthless.  It's a game that's most famous for it's challenge, although fair, takes skill and trial & error to complete. There's many different playstyles to start from, Warrior, Pyromancer, Sorceror, Cleric etc. With all types of weapons ranging from swords, clubs, hammers, axes, spells, bows, crossbows and so on. As you progress in the game you will find bonfires that you can use to level up your character with souls collected from fallen foes. Bonfires are by far the most useful object in the game. They're needed to repair weapons & armor, store your items, level up and eventually fast travel. Everytime you use a bonfire though all the enemies (except bosses and important monsters) will respawn which means you'll have to plan your route and battle strategy accordingly since distance between bonfires can be quite far.It's not a game I'd call frustratingly hard but it is fair and will punish you for every mistake. Every encounter serves a purpose and the level design which at times can be a bit confusing but still brilliantly constructed to tie the world together is one of my favorite things about the game. The story isn't straightforward and the world building & lore is done mostly through reading item descriptions. If you head into a direction and the enemies totally destroy you, that's the game's way of telling you not to go that way yet.All in all, this game is one of my favorites. Get Dark Souls. Get good.

												It is what it is, one of the best and most unforgiving RPG's there is, gameplay-wise.In my opinion though the STORY isn't all too great, don't get me wrong, the lore of the game is amazingly unique and magnificent, but I don't really feel the story of the main character, the Chosen Undead.You really have to get into this game to understand it, both regarding story and gameplay, but once you're in it, it's an amazing experience.It's awesome both co-op and single player. Although the game is meant to be played purely single player or co-op with strangers, I've played with one of my best friends (Trigger) practically the whole game except some little annoying or unimportant parts.If you like getting both your patience and skill pushed to its limits, this is the game for you.And if you like shaping your own character the way YOU want, in this game nothing is stopping you. You choose a main class at the beginning, determining your starting skillpoints and standard equip, but then you're free to do what you want.Example: I started off as the class Sorcerer. Theoretically, I would be blasting enemies away with spells called ""Soul Arrows"", but along the game I also put points into strength and dexterity, so now I also sometimes use a Falchion or a huge Dragonhunter Bow. Ever seen a mage use a bow that's too big to even hold? If you're into shaping your own character in an environment where you aren't sure if enemies will jump out of walls, THIS is THE game for you.9/10			"

												Some games try to scare you with bump-in-the-night shocks and far-off howls, but Dark Souls doesn't require such predictable methods of terror. Its terrors emanate from its very core, each step bringing you closer to another inevitable death. How amazing that such a terrible place could be so inviting. The game's world is so memorable, and its action so thrilling, that it might invade your thoughts even when you aren't playing, silently urging you to escape the real world and return to this far more treacherous one. Dark Souls doesn't just surpass other dungeon crawlers; it skewers them with a razor-sharp halberd and leaves behind their soulless corpses.			"

Lots of secrets and all. You really have to time your attacks in order to be effective, which keeps the combats interesting all along, even if you're grinding you just feel like you're getting better.The Lore is really fun to get into!The PvP is♥♥♥♥♥♥tho (I had lag problems no matter what..probably becuase I a Eurofag, and most people invading are from america or something, which creates huge delays). And if you get too over powered the PvE kinda loses its interest, but that's what NG+ is there for anyway, so it's not really a problem. It has technical flaws but it doesn't stop the fun. One playthrought will take you At least 40 to 50 hours (more if you take your time and really try to find out about everything)It's not necessarly as difficult as people say it is, you just have to get into it.

There's still that great feeling of victory over the game, and a victory of improving yourself as you advance. Yes it is difficult, and harsh at times... but the payoff of pushing forward is beautiful in so many ways.For all the beautiful places you'll visit, all the dreary stories you'll read, and the hardships you experience. This game has left me with memories I will likely never forget. And if you're willing to dive into reading the item descriptions, and the community discussions. You'll find there are some great stories hidden throughout the world, and everything's been placed and designed for a reason... and what a wet dream of a design this game is!			"

And at times you will just want to drop the controller, because yes... this game just shows you how it should feel, being one and alone against a horde of enemies, undead and otherwise and with little help from the outside or secure in the knowledge if the guides around you are sincere or reveling in your misery.Welcome to Dark Souls. One of the greatest games I have played in a long time and will continue to play for a much longer time. (At this point over 120 hours in, still want more)Small tip: Do not be afraid of trying out the DSfix and DSCfix patches to help the game get easier. Each victory counts in this one.			"

												YO, if you're into legitimately challenging games with high risk, high reward, packed to the brim with secrets, nearly limitless replayability and don't mind a shoddy console port (which can easily be remedied by spending 2 minutes installing DSfix), you basically need this game, ok. Also bring a controller. Well, bye!			"

												If you have balls so play Dark Souls then. Prepare to die, prepare to cry, prepare to hate yourself, prepare to hate everyone. But in the end it's mostly fair challenge despite of hackers, dodgy camera and hits through walls. AI is near perfect with some minor complaints (bad pathfinding from time to time). Absolute gorgeous FX and music: it's an excellent balance betweeen dark ambient noise in the meantime and epic shitbricking orchestral compostions in the bosstime. And invasions and co-op make this game even better.			"

												Dark Souls is what more games would be if the industry didn't try so hard to mimic Hollywood. It's what games used to be: challenging, creative, and most importantly; it unobtrusively tells a story about you, the player. It doesn't dwell on side characters or lavish cutscenes; this is all about your journey, as painful or rewarding as it may be.			"

												Reviewing this game purely on it's merits as a game and not a PC port, it's fantastic, easily one of my favorite games of all time, possibly my favorite RPG of all time. With one of the best combat systems of any game, you make a mistake, you'll probably end up dying, it's extremely punishing and thus not for everyone but if you put in the time it's VERY rewarding.The world and level design is in my opinion unmatched in any RPG, there's all sorts of secrets to be found in the game by jumping from ledges and rolling onto different platforms to get to secret areas, the game is rife with secrets.The story is incredibly deep, complex and compelling but is told subtly in item descriptions, random observations around the world and NPC dialogue.PvP is great fun but likely will be laggy, it's entirely optional, as is CO-OP, some people love to play the game with friends, some love to solo it, I'm in the latter category but there is something here for everyone.The enemy design and voice acting are top notch, I honestly cannot say enough good things about this game, but I stress, if you do not enjoy a challenge (that's fine) then Dark Souls is likely not for you, oh, and the PC port is a barebones straight console port, but is easily fixed by using Durante's ""DSFix"" Mod.In my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made.

												What to say about Dark Souls...Dark Souls is amazing in every way. The gameplay, the story, the lore, and the atmosphere. The atmosphere plays a huge roll in Dark Souls, making you feel alone and hopeless through much of the game, considering that almost everyone around you is going insane. Dark Souls has a very original way of intergrating multiplayer into the singleplayer. Around the land of Lordran, you will find these Humanity Sprites. With Humanity, you have the ability to become ""Human"". When you become ""Human"", You are able to summon other players by finding their White Soapstone. This allows you to engage in jolly cooperation! However, be warned. Becoming ""Human"" makes you suspectible to invasions. Invasions are random, and are forced upon you. The invaders sole purpose is to hunt you down and kill you for your humanity, so be cautious whenever you get invaded! Hands down, Dark Souls is one of the best games of 2011-2013, and it has shown it's worth the phrase ""Prepare to Die"".			"

												Bequeathed be upon thee the Darkened Soul, which thou shalt forever regret and rejoice... Dark Souls easily rivals every game in unforgivingness as even the simplest of enemies provide a challenging experience. The difficulty does not adjust to your level, rather it forces you to adapt and improve; that is, unless you want to get stuck in the game. However, it also comes with a stunning storyline, various roleplay elements and possibly one of the most well made settings in gaming history. Dark Souls will exhaust and enrage you as well as it will draw your breath from excitement and thrill. And if that is not enough: Try holding it with both hands.PS: Since the release of the Steam beta Games for Windows Live is no longer required. Still though, a game controler is a must have for this game.			"

												While Dark Souls has a few technical issues this is the closest any video game has come to perfection. Every element of the game (graphics, sound, story, setting, gameplay, difficulty) serves to reinforce the theme of one speck of humanity fighting against the indifferent dying universe. Removing or changing any of the core elements would result in a worse experience. While the game is more difficult than other modern games, it's never unfair. It has no hand-holding tutorials, minimaps, and quest markers because it trusts the player to be intelligent and intrigued enough to try and figure out things on his/her own. It helps that the level design is amazing and unforgettable. There's a reason that the Internet is still harping on about this game, and that its influences can still be seen in other newer games. If not the best than certainly the most important video game of the decade.			"

												Despite the incredible rushjob/absolutely no effort port from the 360 version this is, The game itself makes getting though the initial problems very much worth it. There isn't much I can say that hasen't been said many times already about it.They litteraly took the 360 version, added some new areas and did little else, resulting in a game that has a forced internal resoultion that is the same as the 360 version (1024x720), no graphics options and locked at 30fps. They did infact add an option to change the resolution ingame, but this just upscales it.Just grab DSfix and that's 1 major problem gone. (The lack of graphical options and the 30 fps cap, nothing you can do about the internal resolution though) The games still very much alive and well multiplayer elements are in the process of being transfered to steamworks so no more GFWL soon (Problem 2). On that topic, one thing I will say about this game is it has one of the most unique, creative and seamless approches to multiplayer anywhere. While its mostly the same as this games spiritual predecessor demons souls, it was hardly in need of change anyway. It almost entirely forgos direct interaction, with gestures being your only means of communication outside of friending and msging them. Anyone can leave hints on the ground for players new to the area to read. You can place a summon sign or find one someone else has placed to summon them for help (Jolly cooperation!) Whenever someone else dies you can see a bloodstain on the ground, touching it will show the last few seconds of there life possibly helping you avoid the same fate. And lastly at any place at any time outside of most bonfires while you are in human form you can be invaded by other players and find yourself in PvP. At. Any. Moment. *Paranoia intensifies*. If you have sin points (Gained from killing npcs or getting indicted by a player whose world you invaded) you could find youself getting invaded by a player from the darkmoon covenent whom delever GREAT JUSTICE to those players. These can even all happen at once and you can still be invaded with a summoned player or invaded by more than one person at a time (If you get darkmooned and invaded by a regular darkwraith at the same time or go to the darkroot forest or as I call it: PvP paradise) giving you group pvp. Its not without its problems, mostly from its use of P2P for invasions resulting in some really bad desync at times.This leaves just the horrible controls (Game shows 360 controller buttons regardless if you are using one or not) on keyboard which can be fixed eather by using a controler or using a mouse fix so the lockon at least doesn't swich targets over the SMALLEST mouse movments.

												Dark Souls is the perfect mix of old-school Japanese game design with Western RPG mechanics.It's a love letter to a time when games challenged you, demanded you to make a damned effort; and then rewarded you handsomely with an overwhelming, addictive sense of accomplishment.It's a no-nonsense, pure gameplay game. There are barely any cutscenes. The story (which is rather deep and nicely layered) is told in minute pieces you need to pick up and put together on your own. There are a handful of spoken lines and there's not even any form of lipsynch --every resource was devoted to the *game* part of the game.In a time when everyone goes for the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink school of game design, Dark Souls takes a theme and a gameplay mechanic, and decides to just focus on that. Instead of trying to implement 15 different kinds of games at once and half-assing them all (at best), Dark Souls simply aims to be a game about hitting skeletons with a sword --but then it sets out to be the deepest, most complex title on the subject.The world is large, interconnected, it offers a myriad of ways to go about it, it holds gigantic secret areas, and it just drips with atmosphere. In a whole bunch on non-trivial ways, Dark Souls might just be the one true metroidvania of the 21st century.Dark Souls is one of those things that will be talked about in gaming history books.Do I recommend this game? There is no ""thumbs up"" big enough \[T]/			"

												You need a game pad. You need some mods(just 1, 2 if you want to play with friends).Those are the two bad things about this game.Nietzsche said ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"". But he was a noob, never played to dark souls. What kill, teach!That's it. After a while you will understand that failing is not frustration(in this game) and actually if you know what to do it's easy.A friend of mine used to play only easy games because controller have a in-built gravity system that pull them to the TV/monitor. When he started to play this game.. well he hated me but ended up loving the game, try it.. just try.			"

												THIS GAME HAS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL SCENERY (love those environments), AS WELL AS VERY DETAILED AND AMAZING ARTWORK (shout out to that monster art), ALL WRAPPED UP INTO A VAST AND GRITTY STYLED WORLD THAT CONTAINS THE STUFF OF LEGENDS (Hydras, dragons, basalisks, giant clams with tiny legs & hidden lore are included).Many people hate this game, say its impossible & there's nothing worth a look. 'They' probably have anger management problems and no patience. The game starts in a cage, they die, get angry, die faster and more frequently-seeing nothing but stone walls and dangerous enemies at first, they soon rage and quit.""If you try it you might like it""""But i tried it mama!""""Did you really try it? Or did you just eat the slightly burnt crust of THAT GODLIKE PIZZA BAKED BY ODINS VALKYRIES THEMSELVES?!?!?""""GET SOME HAIR ON YOUR CHEST BOY!!!!!"" your mother screams like a drill instructor & slaps uYou will see grand scenery, you will reap treasure beyond imagining, you will FEEL the reward!But only after you trawl through sewers, slay the dealiest enemies, hunt the strangest of creatures, defend yourself from disgusting abominations, to scour the world.This game rewards those who keep cool under pressure & persevere. Get angry, then u get reckless & then you die being reckless. Be smart, learn to properly utilize your arsenal (which can be massive), learn different techniques and tactics, attack effectively and counter appropriately-you'll be the victor. Different weapons and/or different approaches all have their strengths & weaknesses depending upon the situation.THE GRITIf you make a mistake & don't die, then it's a good outcome.If you don't look for openings and attack immediately instead, the enemy may do the same, so you both stab each other & die clutching your stomach-assuming the enemy doesn't have armour enough to endure your hit that is.If you dodge a heavy weapon, before it's lifted back up you can stab that insolent fool in the back if your fast enough-but if you don't dodge it... Your body will be pulverized into the ground.However adept you become, a single mistake or a single random occurence that catches you off-guard, can mean your death.THE PVP & CO-OP IS VERY GOODAlthough there are a few bugs-like the small online delay when receving backstabs from other players (which there are quite a few methods to prevent), it is fairly balanced (there are a few exceptions that are unfairly harder to counter then others to the extreme, but there are ways).I MUST STRESSThat if you like a proper challenge, a first playthrough while summoning phantoms to help may spoil your experience & transform u into a dependant cherub.There are optional areas & hidden weapons-don't miss em! The Great Hollow is a favourite of mine.Bare chest & WARRIOR class for versatity is recommended IMO. 16 strength and 12-14 dexterity for great weapon choice and range.Unless u wanna crush things, then go BANDIT.26-28 strength for 99% of your enemy crushing needs.Barechest is no longer recommended, but rather a necessity.Sorcerer for easier mode, the class starts off wth lazors.25 minimum intelligence to rub crystals on your weapons.Wear a skirt.But if you wanna be a baus, but you also want to fire your lazors, then complete the game without increasing vitality or endurance.

												I have just finished my second playthrough of this Dark Souls PtD Edition and damn, that game is a fine piece of art and entertainment. There is a reason why it receives so much acclamation and it's not about it's difficulty per se. The game actually grows on you as an experience, and make no mistake, dying is part of the experience.TL;DR: 1) bad port but with modders help can achieve optimal funcionality; 2) great visual art, with lots of inspiring moments and gorgeous views; 3) goodt soundtrack and an ""ok"" voice acting; 4) exceptional level design; 5) ingenious multiplayer component; 6) deeply satisfying combat, especially because of the high skill curve; 7) a beautiful minimalistic story that you unravel by yourself.First off a fair warning: this is a great game, but a very bad PC port, so to enhance your experience the most you should search for a mod called""DSFix"" and another one called ""PvP Watchdog"". If your rig can take it, you should also download a mod for HD texures, as it improves the visual quality a lot. Second warning: play this game with a controller, seriously, it is hard enough as it is without struggling with a keyboard and mouse in combat.Dark Souls is unique in the sense that it lets you, the player, experience the feelings of desolation, ignorance, fear, persistence, bravery, and last but not least... hope. This game weighs heavily on the atmosphere of an ""Undead"" (that which you are) in a journey that begins almost as serendipity, and develops into influencing the face of the land of Lordran. To accomplish this feat, the game is very minimalistic about its story, and there are almost no evnts that directly robs the player's agency. Hell, besides a few instructions i nthe first level of the game and the DLC, the game actually almost never tells you directly anything at all! Yet, this is amazing, there is a distinct feeling of awe by discovering th story and feeling, yourself, as disposessed and yer tencaious as your ""Undead""character. By talking to the NPCs and by sheer power of observation you can, piece by piece, unravel this purposedly öpen""story and the background of this mysterious land.In that regard, there is also a great component to this game, which is it's multiplayer approach. Make no mistake: Dark Souls is a single-player game, albeit different from others. If you remain in the ""Human"" state you will seamlessly cross paths with other players in their own Undead Journey, wether py directly interactin wit them or seeing them as phantoms from another ""age"", as time flows in a very strange manner in this land of Lordran. You can leave hem messages to help other players or trick them, and vice-versa, while also being able to invade other players realities or be summoned by them for help. It is a genious concept, really, and one that works very well asides some few connectivity issues.The world itself is connected like early metroidvanias, in a sense that almost all areas fit into each other seamlessly, with shortcuts nd hidden paths to each of them. It is also a neat RPG where you have a relative freedom to build your character as you see fit, and mix might with magic and so on. The combat is very good and the gameplay is polished, with the caveat that you will have to discover by yourself or with the help of others how everything works (or get a guide in the internet), especially the tidbits of combat mechanics. This game is very hard, but that is a good thing, because the difficult is tied to your skill as a player (your equipment and stats realy come into play later, but the breaking point if you will keep dying a lot will be your skill) as it blends well the gameplay and story of the game. It has no pause button, it does not teach you the advanced mechanics of the game, and if you are not careful, Dark Souls will punish you for your mistakes, because even the lowest of minions can pose a considerable threat. There are very few moments when the game warrants cruel sudden kills, all of it are tied to navigating the land (pitfalls, etc.), but you will learn to avoid these. Dying, I repeat, is part of the experience, and you will die A LOT playing this game.So, I fully recommend this game (with mods to fix the bad port)... go buy it and prepare to die!			"

												If you haven't played this game yet, don't doubt in getting it on this holiday sale. Yes, it was poorly ported but nothing a controller (Which I strongly recommend the xbox 360 one) and a mod can fix. The enemies, the enviroment, everything makes you get immersed completely into the Dark Souls universe. The difficulty on the game is challanging yet not unfair once you find a way to beat each enemy but as the name of the game says, prepare to die... The only negative points I've found in the game are the hackers and how long it takes to summon a specific someone: It's getting a tad ridiculous all the people that seem to be level 1 with everything maxed out or worse, with infinite health. About summoning a friend, it is really tricky sometimes, but also depends of luck: One day you can summon your friend just fine and another day... you won't be able to summon your friend no matter what, or the summon will fail over 20 times (yes, 20 or even more) before it will finally work.

												Dark Souls is a truly gritty, patience defying, inventive, and unique hack and slash role playing game. As someone who normally is not even remotely interested in the genre, I find this game to be breath of fresh air. Extremely challenging and downright rage inducing at times, prepare yourself for a steep learning curve. However, once you beat a boss, clear an area, or finally get that coveted item the satisfaction is immense. It really helps if you have a friend to show you the ropes and help you with boss fights. (Thanks Jason!) Most importantly, this game would be unplayable without a controller.I highly recommend this wonderfully dark and gloomy game if you are looking to test your mettle and your patience.			"

												This is a terrible port, but thanks to the community it's decent now. DSFix is a must to fix the screen resolution issue, google it. And you could pick up some texture mods from the nexus site. This game sucks on keyboard and mouse, I'd really take the controller required disclamer serious. The game is brilliant, it pretty much has alot of old school gaming to it. It's difficulty is a bit exaggerated, and is purely difficult as the game doesn't spoonfeed the player and leaves everything from combat to the story up to his/her interpretation. There is alot of trial and error on your first play. The online play is cute, however not GFWL that is tied to it.The art direction, sound, animation and combat is very good. To me art direction is more important than ""graphics"". Because I'd take Bioshock or this over a Crysis Game.The only weird thing about this game is that it really starts off with a steep difficulty curve, right up to the bell gargoyle fight. This has pretty much made it into my list of favorite games. Just make sure you get DSfix first for this game, and also a controller.			"

												So I'm pretty sure what happened here is Japan decided it wanted make a Skyrim game. But, what they can't understand is that a true RPG makes you feel like a hero. In this, you die all the time. And, as all basic game development tells you, every time you allow the player to die it devalues the player character as a world power. By the time you've died 17 times on the same enemy, nothing is left of playing as a hero.No one wants to play some game where a rat is a threat. People want to play games where they can kill dragons by pressing RT four times. One thing that I will hand to this game though, is that it has some truly stellar loot progression. I started with nothing more that a simple broken sword, but then after much ado I found my first true blade. That was a truely monumental moment of experience, but the rest of the game failed to meet up to the standards of that moment.Also, this game is run by the Nazis, because you in fact DO lose your XP. I can't count the amount of times I was moments away from reaching a new level of power required to use a mighty weapon, only to fall to my death due to the game's pisspoor collision detection.That brings me nicely to quite possibly the games biggest problem, you can use a spell a limited amout between resting. this essentially removes spellcasting as a viable combat option. The game fails again by failing to implement a score, in fact most of the game is silent. Overall, I give Dark Souls : Prepare to Die Edition a dissapointing 7/10.			"

												First of all, despite how many people tote the frustration brought on by playing it, this game is by no means exceptionally difficult. Though that's not to say that it isn't challenging, because it certainly is. What makes it seem so daunting the first time around is the contrast to the sheer, often insulting, amount of nanny hand-holding that we're used to seeing from major release titles, which makes Dark Souls feel very refreshing to play and I keep finding myself coming back for more.This lack of handholding is similarly reflected in the storytelling. This game certainly has a story, but unlike many other games it is not told to you outright. Instead, it is subtly told through elements in the world, primarily through item descriptions, but also through NPC dialogue and small details in the world. It is therefore up to you as a player to pay careful attention and to go out of your way to piece the story together yourself, which, I can promise you, is rewarding. Personally, I love this as this means that I don't have to sit through the several minutes of cutscenes and NPC dialogue which seriously cripple the replayability of other games (*COUGH* mass effect *COUGH*).My favourite aspect of the game is its combat which is, above all, exceptionally fluid. The controls are well calibrated, and can best be described as tight. It should be noted that the controls are, by default, severely marred by an atrocious port BUT, thankfully, there exists a mod called DSFix which resolves most of the issues. Even with the fix, I strongly reccomend using some kind of controller over the old faithful mouse+keyboard. Combat in and of itself is governed by only a few simple mechanics, but, together, these make for a great experience requiring the use of tactical thinking.This game is also renowned for its innovative multiplayer. Instead of seperate single-player and multi-player experiences, there are means by which other players can traverse the gap to your world as phantoms, or you can enter theirs. You may either summon other players to help you defeat enemies in the area, including the boss, for which they will recieve a small bounty of souls, or they can forcibly enter your world with the objective of mercilessly preying upon you and claiming your humanity. For the invader, entering your world is random, which is, to say the least, exciting due to the resulting unpredictability. Have you invaded an inexperienced player which you will effortlessly smear into the ground or a grizzled veteran accompanied by multiple phantoms, more than ready to recieve you or a lone host lying in deadly ambush?Unfortunately, while I love this game, there are some unfortunate flaws. As mentioned before, this is one of the most abysmal PC ports that I have ever experienced. DO NOT attempt to play this game until you have installed DSFix! While this will resolve the majority of the issues, the game still lacks optimization for PC hardware and therefore does not perform as well as other games which have possess similar graphical quality. Once again, I highly reccomend a controller (I use a PS3 controller), but this is up to your personal taste.Another objectively bad issue is the poor networking. Dark Souls is strictly peer-to-peer in its multiplayer and also features bad programming in terms of managing it. Consequently, attempting to summon other players into your world or attempting to invade to PvP will often fail. Additionally, this game features highly unusual lag. This is inconsequential in PvE, but during PvP combat, expect to see other players teleporting around the screen occasionally or even appearing behind you suddenly, stabbing you in the back, despite appearing in front of you moments before.My final gripes with the game are with the community. Unfortunately, the nature of the PC means that it is much easier than on consoles to cheat. As someone who frequently engages on PvP, I encounter people on a daily basis with hacked health, modded weapons, infinite stamina, cheated in items, and much more. The best sollution when you discover that someone is cheating is to immediately disconnect from the game. NEVER continue to engage them, as this allows them to take advantage of the cheats they're using and gain the satisfaction from using them.This is not my only complaint. Due to how this game renowned for its difficulty, the community is rife with players who are often condescending, if not downright smug. Whenever someone asks something like ""Hey, can anyone give me advice on defeating X boss?"", there will often be several people with offers of advice, but you can usually expect one person to reply with ""Oh, X boss is really easy. I defeated X boss on my first try!"". This also translates to PvP: ""I hate it when people use Y in pvp! It's so overpowered!"" often incites a reply like ""Y is so easy to counter. I almost never lose to people who use Y.""Complaints aside, I do really love this game. In fact, I would wholeheartedly state that this is my absolute favourite game of all time.			"

												I'm a big fan of the Souls series (and Bloodborne of course).This is a game all about sperimentation: try, die, change accordingly to your mistakes (or you will die again). You try out what build best suits you, what weapon is best for your build, and so on. The gameplay is nearly perfect, but in my opinion what makes this game shine is the lore. Miyazaki's way of storytelling is at first glance incosistent. But, like many gameplay and design details, this is a deceive. Try out a YouTube channel that discuss the lore (ENB, TerraMantis, VaatiVidya and many others), and you will find hours of awesome stories. This is a great added value: even if you are not playing the game you are enjoying it.This is the best of the Souls series, don't miss it!			"

												I was hesitant to recommend this game as previously it was only on Games For Windows live, which is a pain to get working properly. Now GFWL can be opted out of I can't recommend it more. The PC port comes with some kinks which are easily sorted out via mods, so be warned you're probably going to have to search for fixes. And although it says the Xbox 360 controller is highly recommended, after a bit of configuring I found the keyboard/mouse to just as good.			"

												This game is awesome, the only negative aspect about it is that you NEED to use a controller, xbox or play station, it doesn't matter, as long as you have one. As soon as you leave that bad aspect of the game behind, everything else is flawless, beatiful game, very enjoyable, i didn't even finish it yet after playing for more than 100 hours because of all the fun i'm having in darkroot forest doing pvp. I played Dark Souls II before this one, and i loved it, but honestly i liked this one even more, the only thing i missed was the option to reset your skill points, or however you wanna call them, because for any new player it would be a nightmare to play this game without even knowing how to level up properly. If you buy Dark Souls, you'll get a challenging, exciting and beatiful game with an amazing combat system, Every area is different, you'll never get the feeling that you are doing the exact same thing, you have a lot of freedom to choose how to fight your enemies, an open world where you can choose where to go, and when to do so. It has an amazing storyline, most characters you'll find in this game have more backstory than some of the main characters of other games. The world is so well designed that everything is connected, as soon as you finish an area you can activate shortcuts so if you feel like going back there's no need to clear the whole place once again, This game is art, it's like a Van Gogh, only difference is that you'll probably have to fight van gogh, cut his ear, and then slap him with that same ear!!! So, what are you waiting for? time to GIT GUDSpanish:Este juego es genial, el único aspecto negativo que tiene es que TENES que usar un control, ya sea de Xbox o play station es irrelevante, mientras tengas uno… Dejando de lado ese aspecto negativo del juego, todo lo demás es perfecto. No lo termine después de haber jugado más de 100 horas debido a que estoy cagandome de risa, y divirtiéndome haciendo pvp en Darkroot Forest, jugué la secuela antes que este juego, (Dark souls II) y me encantó, pero este me gustó incluso más, Lo único que extrañe del 2, es que, en este juego no tenes la opción de resetear tus puntos (los que adquirís por cada nivel que subís y definen a tu personaje) lo cual puede ser pésimo para alguien nuevo en el juego, ya que bueno… si no sabes cómo invertir bien los puntos, la paliza que te van a dar, ni te la olvidas…. Si compras el juego, vas a tener  esto: Un juego difícil, que te va a costar ganar, y te vas a excitar cada vez que le rompas el orto a un boss, porque el seguro te lo rompe 20 veces antes.  Si estás acostumbrado a los juegos de acción y aventura actuales, seguro que los npc normales te parecen jefes, porque te van a partir, Dejando eso de lado, el juego es bellísimo, es increíblemente creativo, la imaginación de los creadores realmente voló porque cada área que visitas es única, y el juego nunca te deja esa sensación de que haces las cosas de forma repetida, o que los enemigos son los mismos porque ese no es el caso, hay un millón de lugares, un millón de enemigos, un millón de armas, un millón de jefes para partirte el orto, una hidra de 100 metros es considerada un mini jefe, así que ya sabes lo que te espera. Los personajes que se suponen que son secundarios, tienen más historia que varios de los personajes principales de otros juegos, pero no te confundas, no te vas a comer diálogos o escenas que no puedas adelantar, toda la historia del mundo está ahí para que vos la busques, no te fuerzan a conocerla en ningún momento. El mundo está todo conectado, cuando terminas un área podes activar atajos y volver cuando quieras sin tener que despejar todos los bichos que habían, Este juego es arte, es como un Van Gogh, la única diferencia siendo es que, probablemente tengas que pelear contra Van Gogh, cortarle vos la oreja, y darle cachetazos con esa misma oreja. No esperes más, comprate el juego.			"

												Do I recommend this game? hell yeahDark Souls gave me lots of pleasure and very unique experience.At first I heard of this game on 9gag and decided to try. I played lots of RPGs and ARPGs. The last one I played was Skyrim. Oh boy, Dark Souls seemed to be very hard in comparison to Skyrim. I made a lot of mistakes and Dark Souls doesn't forgive them. The first character was ruined. With the second character I finished the game and it wasn't easy. But after playing DS3 I learned a bit more and now DS1 doesn't feel very difficult or unfair. Zero. You will need a gamepad, DSFix and other mods that you can find on nexus mods to make this purchase worthwhile on PC. The online isn't great nowadays, but if you manage to get some jolly cooperation, or get to invade or be invaded, you'll get some of this unique Souls experience. First of all you have to understand that Dark Souls is more a puzzle game, than simple hack and slash. You need to read every clue you can find about the world and mechanics, because nothing is explained. Forget anything you knew about ARPG games. And don't be afraid to die - this is part of the gameplay. The game is about perseverance and overcoming the obstacles. Second, understand the combat mechanics. This includes dodging, blocking, parrying and backstabbing. Also understand how weapon enhancement, ascension and stat scaling work - this is very important, because you need to level up your weapons as you level up your character.Third, understand how your stats work. Resistance is absolutely useless. Str and Agl don't give a lot of damage boost if your weapon is not upgraded, so at the beginning consider investing in HP and Endurance. Watch for your weight limit, armor defense properties and poise that defines if your attacks can be interrupted. Match your equipment to your enemies’ weakness. Fourth, don't sell or dispose your items, as a lot of them are hard to obtain and are available only once in a playthrough.And the last one. Don't rush. Observe your enemies, observe your surroundings, observe the world. The plot is pretty solid, but you will probably miss it, because you need to piece together a lot of things - the intro, the dialogs (which are in old English), the item descriptions, the location you find these items at and the design of the enemies. There are no definite answers, so you have to use your imagination.  If you finished reading this review, you are probably ready to take on this masterpiece. I envy you.			"

												This game comes with a laundry list of great features: an exceptionally well-built world (both in terms of level design and backstory), great controls (in a game where this is very important), good balancing, an enticing story that makes you feel both very important and very small at the same time, and some of the best sense of accomplishment you can get from a video game (which comes both from the gameplay and from finding the story, as much of it is not told directly to you but learned from inference). Also of note is the great soundtrack, which I occasionally still listen to outside of the game. Something that must be mentioned the reputation this game has for its difficulty...and it's somewhat deserved. For the first few hours you will likely struggle. The fun comes when you get the hang of it, understand that you're not superman (like you are in many games), and get that sense of accomplishment. Not for the faint of heart or someone looking for a game to breeze through, but totally worth the time investment needed to improve. This is one of the few games where killing the first area enemies still feels satisfying after many hours played (since they were so difficult when you first begin the game). If you enjoy action-RPGs, a sense of improvement and accomplishment, and games with fantastic story, worlds, mood, and music, or if you just enjoy a challenge, pick this up. No other game will ever feel quite the same as it did before you played Dark Souls.			"

												Don't let the ""Dark Souls is hard"" hype scare you away. There's a few different types of difficulty in games: the kind that tests your skill and dexterity with the controller, the kind that tests your brain and makes you figure things out, and the ""arcade hard"" that just screws you over randomly and takes your money. Dark Souls is the perfect balance of all three, so even if you're not very good at hard games (like me), the design and balance makes it accessible to anyone who's willing to get in the right ""mode"" and put in the effort.Every combat encounter requires some strategizing, some practice, and a little bit of luck. It is punishing, you lose ""souls"" and ""humanity"" whenever you die, but you do have a chance to get it back, and if it's gone forever, it's not the end of the world. Just accept your losses and, if you can't bring yourself to try that path again, there's usually some other nook to explore in this game's well-designed and wonderful looking world. And stuff will occasionally come out of nowhere and kill you randomly, which if you're in the right mindset just makes the game more hilarious and enjoyable.This game is well worth playing. If you're willing to take it slow, learn the tricks, and trudge your way through, you'll discover a varied and wonderful-looking world with many excellent surprises, some of which throw you off a cliff.

												I havent played much of the computer version but i have complete the game on a different platform, this game has an emersive world and story that involves the death of gods, powerful allies being driven mad and becoming your greatest enemy, and the game somes up to wether you save the lives of those who coulde heal the world or leave them to die.

												Dark Souls is easier than Demon's Souls.-You don't have to worry about limited herbs, estus flasks are auto recharged on a bonfire.-Lots of bonfires (checkpoints).-Characters and environment are not as dark as in Demon's Souls, easier on the eyes.PC version has a lot of bugs, but enjoyable nevertheless. Gamepad is a must.Game is exquisite, challenging and beautiful on its own way. Unique experience.Prepare to die!			"

												Let me tell you: At first, I hated this game. A lot. But I gave it a second chance, really tried my hardest to persevere... and now I have to say that I absolutely love this game. It's incredibly rewarding and has rich and fascinating lore. I honestly can't wait for the sequel to come, and since it's on the summer sale right now I thought I'd write up a recommendation for it. Pick it up, but remember that if you invest some time in it, chances are you'll get stuck and spend a LOT of time with it. I've almost got 40 hours clocked, but I still have 2 bosses left until I beat the regular game. Then there are 6 levels of New Game+ to try... :D			"

												This is, to be honest, a good game but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port.Only buy this game if you are planning on using a controller hooked up to your PC. Using a keyboard and mouse is impossible without a patch (that the community had to create) and even then it is still not that responsive.You will have to create a Microsoft Account, then an xbox live account and be signed into xbox live the entire time you play. Games For Windows Live (GFWL) is the xbox live server and it has been known to disconnect and boot you from the game.The game itself is also very laggy especially during fight scenes (not just my computer, it's a known issue).If you can get over all of that though, go for it.

												Although there's not much of a compelling story, the gameplay itself is the real treat. After hearing about how difficult the game is, I gave it a shot, and damn it did not dissapoint. There will be times when you *will* get frustrated, but once you clear the difficulty, the feeling of victory is very satisfying; it's not something you get to feel with many games now.On the worst days, this game will be completely sadistic and make you hate everything. But when those days pass and victory is achieved.... you just need to feel that sensation....Note: I played this exclusively on my Nvidia Shield and had 0 problems. I highly recommend you follow the store notice and obtain a 360 compatibile controller. Also, as others have noted, for the PC version, you'll need the DSFix mod so you can play at high resolutions.			"

												It is what it is, one of the best and most unforgiving RPG's there is, gameplay-wise.In my opinion though the STORY isn't all too great, don't get me wrong, the lore of the game is amazingly unique and magnificent, but I don't really feel the story of the main character, the Chosen Undead.You really have to get into this game to understand it, both regarding story and gameplay, but once you're in it, it's an amazing experience.It's awesome both co-op and single player. Although the game is meant to be played purely single player or co-op with strangers, I've played with one of my best friends (Trigger) practically the whole game except some little annoying or unimportant parts.If you like getting both your patience and skill pushed to its limits, this is the game for you.And if you like shaping your own character the way YOU want, in this game nothing is stopping you. You choose a main class at the beginning, determining your starting skillpoints and standard equip, but then you're free to do what you want.Example: I started off as the class Sorcerer. Theoretically, I would be blasting enemies away with spells called ""Soul Arrows"", but along the game I also put points into strength and dexterity, so now I also sometimes use a Falchion or a huge Dragonhunter Bow. Ever seen a mage use a bow that's too big to even hold? If you're into shaping your own character in an environment where you aren't sure if enemies will jump out of walls, THIS is THE game for you.9/10			"

												10/10 would praise the sunFirst of all, you will die, there's no way around it and without help you will die a multitude of times. Yes, you will get mad. Yes, you will want to punch a hole through your screen. This is all on solo with no guides. I know because I used to feel the same ways. BUT when you do complete boss levels, certain goals and parts you were stuck on you tend to get such an amazing sense of accomplisment and relief, only then to die again of course. However, these things will not come easily so don't think they will, unlike other games, the storyline and objectives aren't handed to you on a silver plate; in fact you get roughly one decent hint about objectives in the game made by directors. The other hints all come from messages on the ground which means you'll have to trust in the ""kindness"" of other, be scrupulous don't trust messages as some are indeed trolls. The storyline is also immensely deep and you really have to search for clues, the reason it's not too clear is because the creators wanted each person to imagine it in their own way but there is a wiki which displays what the storylines main ideas are if you want to use that.Basically, yes I recommend this game and will continue to recommend this game. Forever. This is one of the only games that I enjoy replaying over and Over and OVER again not only on New Game+ but with new characters.Although, bear in mind, this game is far from perfect in the eyes of others. There are graphical fixes and online fixes if you want to play with your friends, here is the link...if you do this, follow the instructions CAREFULLY, when I did this I messed up STEP 3 as I editted the wrong file:http://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/828935269278734403/Also, if you plan on using the keyboard I WISH YOU THE MOST LUCK as this was rushed for pc porting as the developers really only assumed it would be wanted on console so therefore made a crappy PC port, so to get the full experience use a controller and a gamepad. Good luck and PRAISE THE SUN!

												Y'all Gwynn to Die*laugh tracks*Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. Plays well. High Replayability. Huge variety of builds, equipement and weapons. Keeps you on your toes constantly. Lots of secrets and all. You really have to time your attacks in order to be effective, which keeps the combats interesting all along, even if you're grinding you just feel like you're getting better.The Lore is really fun to get into!The PvP is♥♥♥♥♥♥tho (I had lag problems no matter what..probably becuase I a Eurofag, and most people invading are from america or something, which creates huge delays). And if you get too over powered the PvE kinda loses its interest, but that's what NG+ is there for anyway, so it's not really a problem. It has technical flaws but it doesn't stop the fun. One playthrought will take you At least 40 to 50 hours (more if you take your time and really try to find out about everything)It's not necessarly as difficult as people say it is, you just have to get into it. But it's worth investing time into it, because it's truly rewarding in the end.			"

												Definitely one of the most rewarding experiences that I have had in a long time. Is it frustrating? Yes, sometimes terribly so. But it makes it all the more worth while when you finally break past that boss or difficult section. Also, this game has one of the best lores that I have ever seen in games, and it's almost a shame that most of the lore is communicated through item descriptions and very rarely explained through the story. It's been a blast and I can see myself still putting in countless more hours into this game.Unfortunately, the keyboard - mouse support is awful.

												I've nominated this game for having stood the ""Test of Time"" award, and here's why.Even if the story goes all over your head because the activity of ""dying"" has distracted you. There's still that great feeling of victory over the game, and a victory of improving yourself as you advance. Yes it is difficult, and harsh at times... but the payoff of pushing forward is beautiful in so many ways.For all the beautiful places you'll visit, all the dreary stories you'll read, and the hardships you experience. This game has left me with memories I will likely never forget. And if you're willing to dive into reading the item descriptions, and the community discussions. You'll find there are some great stories hidden throughout the world, and everything's been placed and designed for a reason... and what a wet dream of a design this game is!			"

The game tosses you in the world and gives you little to no information on what to do, allowing you to explore and find out yourself how everything works. Things that could of been better in some cases is the enemy AI, Co-Op with friends regardless of level range and not using Games for Windows LIVE.All in all, great game, definitely worth to try it out at a friend and definitely worth the pay.

												Reviewing this game purely on it's merits as a game and not a PC port, it's fantastic, easily one of my favorite games of all time, possibly my favorite RPG of all time. With one of the best combat systems of any game, you make a mistake, you'll probably end up dying, it's extremely punishing and thus not for everyone but if you put in the time it's VERY rewarding.The world and level design is in my opinion unmatched in any RPG, there's all sorts of secrets to be found in the game by jumping from ledges and rolling onto different platforms to get to secret areas, the game is rife with secrets.The story is incredibly deep, complex and compelling but is told subtly in item descriptions, random observations around the world and NPC dialogue.PvP is great fun but likely will be laggy, it's entirely optional, as is CO-OP, some people love to play the game with friends, some love to solo it, I'm in the latter category but there is something here for everyone.The enemy design and voice acting are top notch, I honestly cannot say enough good things about this game, but I stress, if you do not enjoy a challenge (that's fine) then Dark Souls is likely not for you, oh, and the PC port is a barebones straight console port, but is easily fixed by using Durante's ""DSFix"" Mod.In my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made.

												By far the single most amazing game I have ever come across. No game has ever punished me for my own mistakes as hard as Dark Souls, No game has ever rewarded me as much for winning as Dark Souls, and No game has ever come close to the sense of accomplishment that Dark Souls gave me. I give this masterpiece a 10/10, a game that’s truly worthy of that rank.			"

												Dark Souls is definitely a game of great difficulty for a player who is not well prepared or familiar with the game. The game offers a very interesting storyline packed with lore and incredible detail as well as an addictive urge to come back for more. In all likelihood, most of your first playthrough of the game will be spent learning and questioning where you have gone wrong but usually its the simple mistakes the game tricks you into making.  Majority of the time will also be spent screaming and raging at the countless amount of deaths you'll be facing, as death is inevitable with this game (YOU DIED). Dark Souls becomes less difficult once you become familiar with the games concept, item locations and build combinations. Either way it will always provide you with a decent challenge so dont expect any less! The game was created as a masterpiece overall and it deserves all the praise and reputation it has. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who awaits a challenge, loves a story driven adventure and has the time to sink a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of hours into it!Dark Souls 1 in my opinion is the best of the the 3 due to its amazing lore, gameplay and the land of Lordran as its simply stunning. Also mentioning the amazing DLC which easily stands out as the best dlc of the franchise. Out of the 3 it is the game i can get to ng ++++ and still look forward to more and more gameplay. Bandai Namco should be proud of what they created because i know i am as well as thousands of others.   I give the game a 9.9 out of 10 for all reasons listed above, so dont hesitate to buy it! Oh and dont forget to always praise the sun!			"

Mysterious world with clever level design.Obtuse UI needlessly obfuscates basic information, takes getting used to.Developer mantra of ""it's not a bug it's a feature,"" evident.

												Do I recommend this game? hell yeahDark Souls gave me lots of pleasure and very unique experience.At first I heard of this game on 9gag and decided to try. I played lots of RPGs and ARPGs. The last one I played was Skyrim. Oh boy, Dark Souls seemed to be very hard in comparison to Skyrim. I made a lot of mistakes and Dark Souls doesn't forgive them. The first character was ruined. With the second character I finished the game and it wasn't easy. But after playing DS3 I learned a bit more and now DS1 doesn't feel very difficult or unfair. Zero. You will need a gamepad, DSFix and other mods that you can find on nexus mods to make this purchase worthwhile on PC. The online isn't great nowadays, but if you manage to get some jolly cooperation, or get to invade or be invaded, you'll get some of this unique Souls experience. First of all you have to understand that Dark Souls is more a puzzle game, than simple hack and slash. You need to read every clue you can find about the world and mechanics, because nothing is explained. Forget anything you knew about ARPG games. And don't be afraid to die - this is part of the gameplay. The game is about perseverance and overcoming the obstacles. Second, understand the combat mechanics. This includes dodging, blocking, parrying and backstabbing. Also understand how weapon enhancement, ascension and stat scaling work - this is very important, because you need to level up your weapons as you level up your character.Third, understand how your stats work. Resistance is absolutely useless. Str and Agl don't give a lot of damage boost if your weapon is not upgraded, so at the beginning consider investing in HP and Endurance. Watch for your weight limit, armor defense properties and poise that defines if your attacks can be interrupted. Match your equipment to your enemies’ weakness. Fourth, don't sell or dispose your items, as a lot of them are hard to obtain and are available only once in a playthrough.And the last one. Don't rush. Observe your enemies, observe your surroundings, observe the world. The plot is pretty solid, but you will probably miss it, because you need to piece together a lot of things - the intro, the dialogs (which are in old English), the item descriptions, the location you find these items at and the design of the enemies. There are no definite answers, so you have to use your imagination.  If you finished reading this review, you are probably ready to take on this masterpiece. I envy you.			"

												Game: Dark Souls: Prepare to Die EditionScore: 9/10Recommended? YESWorth a buy at full price? YESThis game is one of my all time favorites (and let's just say I've played hundreds of games).With punishing gameplay that gives you an adrenaline rush (I'm not kidding you) and a storyline so complicated most people don't even understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, Dark Souls is the one of best games you can possibly play.Many consider it to be one of, if not, THE HARDEST game ever created for a reason. However, this game is by no means ""unfair"" (well... sort of... *cough* ornstein and smough *cough). When you die (and you WILL) it is entirely YOUR fault. You slowly learn how to play the game after a time, and when you win you will *literally* cry tears of joy.This game is not for everyone. If you lack patience and/or the ability to persevere, this game is NOT for you.Keep in mind: the PC port of the game is LOUSY... install a mod called ""DSfix"" to improve graphics and performance.Conclusion:Overall, 'tis the one of the best games money can buy. With a unique and difficult combat system that has you at the edge of your seat every minute of playtime, and a cryptic story so complex you'll want to look into it some more, Dark Souls is a masterpiece to be remembered by any player for many years to come.Score: 9/10Worth a buy at full price? YES			"

												Incredibly immersive and engaging with its ambience, atmosphere, and lore. Equipment is diverse; equipment mechanics are well-designed and highly customizable (minimal restrictions), where any equipment set is viable. Combat system is incredible and allows for diversity of playstyles and weapon combinations.This game rewards the player for playing smart, exploring and discovering all aspects of the game, and adapting to the environment, of which the level designs are well-thought-out and interesting to play through. Steep learning curve, but game difficulty is fair, challenging, and immensely rewarding once overcome.			"

												I can't even begin to describe how good this game is, but, i'll try.Basically, it has everything a gamer could possibly want:-It's challenging to the point of frustration (which only makes winning more satisfying)-It has a large array of gear and loot to keep the collectors and completionists busy for a long while-It has a very in depth, delicate and extremely profound and complicated storyline and lore-Your character has a number of different attributes with a number of different combat paths to take-The combat system is one of the best i've seen in a long while, and while it is hard it is very fun to learn-Almost every weapon has its own unique fighting style-It has Co-op-It has PvP-It has Shops and NPC's and sub-plots of different characters woven into the main storyAll in all, this game is almost flawless. But be warned, the learning curve for the first 10 or so hours of gameplay can be unforgiving, so if you do intend on playing this game, make sure that you have cleared your calendar so you can get to the more enjoyable parts of the game. And if you get stuck, try to think outside the box, or just look it up. Some parts are so complex you can be left wondering how anyone ever figured them out at all. It's small wonder that this game was put in the top 20 games ever. I would recommend that everyone play at least the first 3 or 4 bosses of this game to get the true feel of it. It is utterly fantastic.Also, if you figure out how, SAVE SOLAIRE. He is a true bro.			"

It's incredibly rewarding and has rich and fascinating lore. I honestly can't wait for the sequel to come, and since it's on the summer sale right now I thought I'd write up a recommendation for it. Pick it up, but remember that if you invest some time in it, chances are you'll get stuck and spend a LOT of time with it. I've almost got 40 hours clocked, but I still have 2 bosses left until I beat the regular game. Then there are 6 levels of New Game+ to try... :D			"

												This game comes with a laundry list of great features: an exceptionally well-built world (both in terms of level design and backstory), great controls (in a game where this is very important), good balancing, an enticing story that makes you feel both very important and very small at the same time, and some of the best sense of accomplishment you can get from a video game (which comes both from the gameplay and from finding the story, as much of it is not told directly to you but learned from inference). Also of note is the great soundtrack, which I occasionally still listen to outside of the game. Something that must be mentioned the reputation this game has for its difficulty...and it's somewhat deserved. For the first few hours you will likely struggle. The fun comes when you get the hang of it, understand that you're not superman (like you are in many games), and get that sense of accomplishment. Not for the faint of heart or someone looking for a game to breeze through, but totally worth the time investment needed to improve. This is one of the few games where killing the first area enemies still feels satisfying after many hours played (since they were so difficult when you first begin the game). If you enjoy action-RPGs, a sense of improvement and accomplishment, and games with fantastic story, worlds, mood, and music, or if you just enjoy a challenge, pick this up. No other game will ever feel quite the same as it did before you played Dark Souls.			"

												If you want to feel pain, anger, depression and sadness, you did the right thing in buying this game. You will die. No way you gonna survive this game with one life (some pros might). You get beaten to death, you fall, you get poised, you get cursed, you got burned to death and so on and so forth. There are so many ways you will die in this game you won't believe it. Nonetheless you will realize quick that dying is a part of this game like running and fighting. The good thing is that you as a player improve pretty quick. Not only because of the improving equipment you find but also because you improve as a player yourself. You learn how to dodge, when to parry, when to strike. I personally think that Dark Souls shows more than most other games how you improve and learn the game. This is a cool reward.The game has a few problems tho. Without a mod it has only 30 fps. The menus are clumsy and a gamepad is HIGHLY recommended because the Keyboard+Mouse controls are horrible. So you have been warned :)That few concerns aside the game offers a lot of fun. You choose from 4 different attacks. 2 for each hand. It depends what weaponry you have equipped. A heavy axe has a different attack style than a light sword.  The armors influence your speed and how far you can jump and also your dodging speed. The heavier armors really feel like a heavy armor. You can basically feel it on your character. Really well done. The saving system is automatic and if you rest on a bonfire. A bonfire offers regeneration of most effects. It also refills your health potions. So no need to buy one. You have only a certain amount of them but as soon as you rest on a bonfire you get new ones. Be warned tho. If you rest the enemies will respawn. If you die you will be respawn at the last bonfire rested on. As said above your only currency are souls. You earn them from defeating enemies and bosses. No matter if you want to level up your strength or buy arrows or weapons, you use souls. If you die it gets tense. You have to fight your way back to where you died. If you die on the way, every soul you collected and didn't spend for something is lost. That is a hard mechanic and can make you mad, but it is definitely a thrill to get back, especially if you have lost a huge amount of souls.The controls are good. You have to use a gamepad tho. They are pretty darn accurate. You have a lock on system which helps you fighting most enemies. Some huge bosses are better fought without it, especially the ones that fill the whole screen ;)The weaponry and armors are medieval like. Some enchantments here and there for weapons some magic. The basic stuff. A lot to test out and a lot of ways to replay the game.There are so many ways you can play. As a rogue or a flamethrowing knight. Everything is possible.The story is pretty confusing. You don't get that much background. Especially if you don#t listen or meet some characters. So you either listen closely or you check out the wiki on the internet. They are very well written and offer strategies for bosses if you really don't know how to beat them.Well, the bosses. They are great. A large variety. Each with unique moves and appearance. YOu need for each a different strategy, which makes the game even more challenging. The multiplayer is extensive. A big community of pvp players awaits you. Sadly you can't deactivate the pvp completely. So you can be invaded on certain occasions by people that might be way stronger than you and get killed. But those aren't the only ones. People can set markings in certain areas so you can summon them to help you fighting bosses or areas. This is a cool feature, but it is a shame that you can't really play it in singleplayer. Tip. Stay hollow. Nobody can invade you then. Only problem is you don't get some bonuses you would get as human. Well that is enough i guess. Hope you have a little idea what awaits you. I really enjoyed playing it. It was very challenging, but when you beat it. You feel like badass ;) "

All and all the game runs great and my experience is as good as it was on PS3 if not better.So yes.  I recommend this game strongly.  It's amazing.   The caveat is that you'll have to fiddle with things to get it to work.  Good news is, people have been there before and the community is helpful.Man... game is sooo good.   If you are reading this, you know about the game mechanics and why you want to play it.  So if you're trying to decide.  Do it.  Play it on whatever platform you like.

												Dark Souls is a game that doesn't hold your hand, and doesn't want you to want it to. It's a game you learn from experience(read trial and error), or you learn from the community.Myself? I mainly got it from the community. A couple of buddies and some wiki-ing made this game that was once an intimidating cliff into an invigorating hike through the hills. It's not a way to ruin the game, to get others to help you (be it through ""how do I beat this boss?"" or reading a wiki about how to find a certain crafting item); it's simply a different way to play it and enjoy it.This game has the most satisfying combat, one of the most compelling subtle worlds, some seriously cool loot, and an unconventional and interesting multiplayer system.It has it's negatives, certainly; the PC port was not good (DSFix is practically mandatory), Games for Windows Live is not a selling point, the camera can be temperamental, and when you're not progressing it can feel a bit hopeless. BUT; all these things are really a testament to how good the game is because despite all these flaws the game shines through - it's truly grossly incandescant.Bring on Dark Souls 2!			"

												Let me start off by saying that Dark Souls isn't a game for everyone. It can be extremely hard and frustrating at times. Also, playing this game with a gamepad is STRONLY recommended. The PC controls are clunky and poorly optimized, and.. well let's just say that this game won't like that..  With that said, let's move on.Dark Souls is an open-world RPG, that won't hold your hand throughout the game like most games do these days (looking at you, Skyrim). The combat is fantastic, but can be complex at times. It's defenitely not the 2 button-mashing system that other games use. (Still looking..) The game will require your full attention, every single second. Losing your concentration will result in death 9 out of 10 times. But even if the game has your full concentration, there is a great chance that you'll die (especially on your first playthrough). But dying is normal in Dark Souls. Because dying will teach you a lesson. And that's what  Dark Souls is about. Trial and error. The first time you meet a boss and you die you'll think it was an unfair battle, you didn't know what to do. The second time though, you'll know better. And once you figure out you're own perfect strategy and you beat the boss, you'll be rewarded greatly by the game. And you'll feel fantastic. That's a feeling not many games can give you these days. So if you take some of your time to master this game, it will feel like a breath of fresh air. Just try it, if you dare.(Apologies for possible grammar mistakes, English isn't my main language)			"

												Amazing game. I have already played 150+ hours and I plan to play much more. This game has such an intricate story but hardly reveals itself. Also this game leaves the player with choice on where to go, but the other areas might be harder so you go the way it was intended. 9.9/10 Not perfect... But still great.			"

												I simply cannot recommend this game enough.It's a refreshing take on the RPG genre. It doesn't hold your hand through anything. The story flows organically through dialog with no quest markers or logs - just the player and the world, which can be traversed from top to bottom.The difficulty is not artificial in any way; it is simply what you make of it. Learn the mechanics, master them and you will get the most satisfying gameplay experience you've had in a long time. Boss fights are just challenging enough to truly make you feel like you've earned the victory and make it that much sweeter when it comes.The multiplayer component is seamlessly weaved into the single player experience, something more and more games have been doing ever since Dark Souls proved it to be quite the viable mechanic. 10/10 would die again!

												You will die, repeatedly, and then some. The game never tells you where to go, what to do or how you should do something. This is simply leant by your death, over and over. Everything seems like an achievement from finding a new area, a hidden item or learning how to upgrade your weapon. Dying warrants the respawn of mostly everything you’ve just painstakingly killed. The combat mechanics can be cumbersome at times. You can kill the NPCs...permanently. This game is not perfect by any means, but it is simply one of the best games you will ever play. Every complexity\difficulty\flaw somehow seems to add a characteristic you will learn to love. The game becomes manageable only by your improvement as a player and not by the game getting any easier. This is truly an amazing game, one of the best ever made.			"

But know because the enemies are overpower or something like that.It is because we all have learned to play ""easy"" who was something like: Go there, do that , kill him, Congrats. If you are looking for something like this just do not bohter with dark souls. This game is hard because it makes you use your head and brain and learn to see all your surroundings, all the details , try to find patterns and be ready for anything. If you learn to do this and have a LOT of patience and want something to keep you stuck until you beat it, this is the game.*Excuse me if there is any mistake, english is not my mother language*			"

												I remember when this game came out. I remember a lot of people discussing how difficult this game is. I don't remember much else talk as I didn't venture to the game's specific message boards. I shrugged this off. ""Why buy a game simply because it's challenging? It can't really be that hard.""As it turns out, this game can be quite challenging at times. For the most part, it gets gradually more difficult, allowing for one of the best learning curves I have seen in a game. At the beginning, I could hardly do anything except spam a basic attack or strong attack. By the time I reached the end of the game, I really felt like I had learned a lot about how to play this game better, and I do feel it has made me better at games. I ran into combat with confidence in my ability to outclass an opponent rather than achieving victory because of the enemy being weak. It definitely rejuvenated some of the patience I had lost due to the ease of, well, every other game I have played in years. These feelings were cemented in my mind as I began a second playthrough and laughably passed the first of the bosses that really tried me on my first adventure.Yes, this game can be pretty tough, but there is so much more to it than that.There isn't much dialogue like your typical RPG. Don't expect sequence after sequence of cutscenes. Each item has well-written descriptions along with it that help bring out lore in this world of Lordran. As you progress through the game, the few conversations with NPCs that are related to the story are quite informative despite their brief nature. This is fantastic. There are other NPCs not related to the main story that you meet multiple times throughout your adventure. This game can feel quite desolate and lonely much of the time. But when you meet these recurring NPCs, it fosters a feeling of safety and camaraderie. For such little dialogue, it's incredible how developed one of these characters in particular became.The environments do look dated, but they are crafted in such a way that they are still nice to look at while doing an exceptional job providing an atmosphere unique to the area and design.The combat has a surprising amount of depth by using different moves with different combinations of inputs on a controller or keyboard. Each weapon also creates for itself a unique play style which allows the player to play the game in drastically different manners between characters or, if skilled enough, on just one character.This truly is one of the best games I have played. If you have any interest in an RPG, I urge you to purchase this.			"

												Dark Souls is a special game.  Like that one album that made radio hard to listen to, this game raised the bar for millions and created a hunger that, to date, only From Software has been able to satiate.I would encourage everyone to not be discouraged by the legends of its punishing difficulty.  While the learning curve is steep at first, once the player attains fluid control over their character they will enjoy one of the most satisfying combat systems in any game ever made.  The timing windows are somewhat tight, but there's a sublime feeling that comes with perfect dodging, parrying and riposting.  Once you learn the Soulsborne combat system, it can tough to go back to other games.The combat is just one facet of this gem of a game.  The world design is top-notch - there's a delicate sense of beauty to be found within the desolate and oppressive game world.  The level design (especially the first half of the game) is fantastic - not only are the environments varied but there are shortcuts to reward exploration.  Sound design and music are excellent and immersive.  The lore of the game is deep and interesting, but is only hinted at through various dialogues, item descriptions and corpse locations.  The DLC that's included with the PTDE is some of the best DLC ever released.  Both new areas are interesting and at least 3 of the best and most difficult boss fights are found there.This game gets my highest recommendation.			"

												Arguably the greatest game ever made, Dark Souls is atmospheric, complex and beautiful.Your story begins in an asylum where the undead are locked up, never to be seen again, to await the end of the world. That was the plan anyway, but a mysterious figure drops a key into your cage, allowing you to leave the asylum. This marks you as the chosen undead, fated to undertake a pilgrimage to Lordran, land of the ancient Lords.And Lordran is one of the best fantasy worlds ever represented in a video game. Once a magnificent kingdom ruled by gods, Lordran has been overrun by the undead. Yet it still retains its amazing variety, as your quest will take you to forests, swamps, castles, towns, blazing infernos and silent primordial lakes. Lordran's incredibly detailed verticality (indeed you are always travelling up or down) means that the game feels beautifully interconnected and coherent, as you seamlessly walk from one area to the next, uncovering shortcuts that connect to earlier and later locations along the way.Lordran is also a perilous place, and every single enemy is capable of killing you with ease if you're not being careful. In spite of this, the game seldom feels unfair: you lose all your stuff when you die, but if you get back to the place where you were killed - without dying again - you can get it back. This is to say nothing of the bosses. Dark Souls' legendary bosses are in many ways the souls of the areas they inhabit. Every boss fight (ok, Pinwheel excepted...) requires a careful study of the boss' movements and the arena where you're fighting to build up, over the course of many deaths, a strategy to take down the boss. And there are myriad strategies you could construct to take down any given obstacle, since the game mostly rewards all playstyles and equipment choices equally: it is very possible to beat the game using the very first weapon by upgrading it as you go along.All of this is backed up by a story and lore that are revealed slowly, and only when you go looking for them, in conversations with NPCs, description text for items, and the enemies and locations themselves. Nor is the lore ever revealed completely, so the game always feels compellingly shrouded in mystery.Brilliant, right?			"

												Dark Souls is an action RPG that originally came out on the PS3 back in 2011 and later ported to PC. In order to get the best experience out of it you'll need to get DSfix and use that (nexus mods has it or just google it). You'll also need a controller. Keyboard & Mouse controls are absolute garbage and even customizing them is worthless.  It's a game that's most famous for it's challenge, although fair, takes skill and trial & error to complete. There's many different playstyles to start from, Warrior, Pyromancer, Sorceror, Cleric etc. With all types of weapons ranging from swords, clubs, hammers, axes, spells, bows, crossbows and so on. As you progress in the game you will find bonfires that you can use to level up your character with souls collected from fallen foes. Bonfires are by far the most useful object in the game. They're needed to repair weapons & armor, store your items, level up and eventually fast travel. Everytime you use a bonfire though all the enemies (except bosses and important monsters) will respawn which means you'll have to plan your route and battle strategy accordingly since distance between bonfires can be quite far.It's not a game I'd call frustratingly hard but it is fair and will punish you for every mistake. Every encounter serves a purpose and the level design which at times can be a bit confusing but still brilliantly constructed to tie the world together is one of my favorite things about the game. The story isn't straightforward and the world building & lore is done mostly through reading item descriptions. If you head into a direction and the enemies totally destroy you, that's the game's way of telling you not to go that way yet.All in all, this game is one of my favorites. Get Dark Souls. Get good.

												Dark Souls is a masterpiece, but it is not for everyone. What it provides is a dark, rich, intense world with danger lurking around almost every corner. It also has a nasty tendency to punish mistakes, even small ones, with death. While this makes for an experience that can be intensely frustrating, it also makes it an extremely rewarding one as long as you are prepared to put in the effort required.Still best game in the series, period.

												Beating the boss of the Tutorial is just as satisfying as beating the final boss.Game feels like an ""Adventure and Exploration"" type RPG. You explore and kill things to gain EXP and get better.~ Levelling system is entirely open and your ""Class"" is more just your starting stats and equipment. There are no restrictions on gear other than stats. (So, unlike in D&D, your Cleric can wield more than blunt weapons. [This statement was generalized for simplicity's sake.])~ Solid graphics and audio mesh well to create an immersive world.~ Combat system is solid ~ plenty of weapon styles and combat maneuvers with a fluid control system~ Co-op/pvp system is workable, I have few complaints other than an occassional case of lag-stabs and 1 in 20 encounters are with hackers~ Open world allows for you to choose which area to tackle next. Both a blessing and a curse, as new players can go down the ""wrong"" path (read: the 'less easy' path. reminds me of playing Ocarina of Time... But more depressing)~ Story is relatively straight-forward, but the world has a rich history that can be found in item descriptions and encounters with NPCs.~ Game is ""difficult"" but relatively scripted... Feels sort of like playing Super Mario... Things will kick your♥♥♥♥♥until you learn where things are and how they behave.~ Game /can/ be beaten without ever levelling up your character.9/10 ~ Would ragequit another thousand times.\|T|/			"

												  I bought this game on my birthday (shortly after it's release) on a friends recommendation and I thought it was pretty cool not even knowing what I was about to embark upon.  I cautiously traversed through the ""tutorial"" level and yes still managed to die frequently still not knowing this is how it was meant to be.  After many deaths and hours later I started to get a feel for the game but still felt completely lost.  Not wanting to look things up, I wandered aimlessly searching for other ways to progress.  I can't remember too much after that but I do remember the rage and fury and swearing profusely at this game.  I stopped playing for about 3 months before my friend intervened and saved my joy.  Fast forward some time, the bosses are difficult, the terrain is difficult, hell even the mobs are difficult.  But learning how to overcome these challenges made this game my favorite game since it's release date and thereafter.   Frank GFX:          pretty good but smooth and awe inspiring with DSFix (and some other friendly mods)Sound:      the FX of weapons and misc things fit in well in the atmostphere and the music is elegantly composedControls:   natural with controller(360), M&K for those who like a challengeStory:        subtle and amazing (item descriptions helps)Difficulty:  Legendary for newcomers, challenging to say the leastReplay:      Yes because of new game plus and wanting to try new builds			"

												So, I got into this game pretty late on, and when I say that, I mean that I got this game AFTER Dark Souls III came out. Dark Souls III was the game that spurred me into buying this game, and let me tell you, this has to be one of my favorite games out there. This is one of those games that I could pick up and play casually all over again. I love this game. Is it a♥♥♥♥♥♥port from console? Well, yes, but that's what the dsfix is for. Does the game cap you at about 40-45 frames and when you unlock the frames, there's a chance that it could make your frames even worse than it was to begin with? Yes. Is Co-Op literally impossible without a mod of the game? Yeah. This game is by no means perfect, no game really is. But, the combat feels fluid, the various characters are memorable and likeable, there's always something fun or stupid to try out in PvP, and (as we are all aware) Praise the Sun! This game is so flexible with the various styles of play, that anyone can really play it if they know what they want to do. I have played this game with multiple different builds and have had one hell of a time while doing so. Fast builds that don't hit that hard? Yeah, we've got that. Slow builds that hit like a truck? ♥♥♥♥ yeah, you can. Somewhere in the middle of those two? You want it? You got it. As long as you know how to micromanage, you will do fine in this game. I have put over 100 hours into a singleplayer/co-op game from playing it by myself to playing it with one of my best friends. This game was so much fun, and there wasn't many times where I could consider it boring. This game will forever be in my heart, and I look forward to playing Dark Souls III when I get a new graphics card (because it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥right now, and Dark Souls II is not my favorite in the series by any means). The only complaint that I have is that the ending is slightly bland. I won't go into detail as to why because I don't want it to spoil it for anyone that hasn't yet completed the game. You'll just have to see for yourself. But, I digress; I would definitely recommend the game to anyone who is even remotely interesting in Dark Souls. It is definitely worth the $20.			"

												Dark Souls is like a parent. When you do something wrong (fall off of a cliff, get ambushed, roll into a boss's attack, etc), you will be punished. However you aren't being punished because you are disliked or to discourage you, in fact quite the opposite. Dark Souls punishes you so that you will learn, so that you will grow. You will get better at the game, you will triumph, and you will have fought through the pain and the heartache to become a better player. Half of the game is PVE, half of the game is PVP. You don't have to interact with other players, but given the opportunity, you have different options on how you can. Help, or destroy. Give hope or terrorize. How you decide to be around other people is entirely in your hands.Also there's Blighttown. Google ""♥♥♥♥ Blighttown.""Buy the game.			"

												To put it simply, this is one of the worst ports I have ever seen. The developers literally took the X-Box version of the game, and slapped it onto PC. Hear me out, I like the game and brings an interesting challenge, but the problems created by this bad port outweigh any redeeming qualities.The fact that this edition is labeled 'Prepare To Die' should be taken quite seriously. You will die, but not because of the difficulty. I found it strange that they took the original version of the game, put on the label, and didn't bother to fix any issues.I can definitley recommend this game, but not this port. If you want to play, you need to go pick up the PS3 or 360 version rather than this abomination.Edit: After fiddling about with some community mods, the experience of this port has improved greatly. Both DS Fix and DS Mouse Fix work great together and fine tune some of the biggest issues. I'd also recommend some mods to upscale the graphics to be higher resolution but remain otherwise unchanged.Overall I now find this game for enjoyable, although a challenge. I would now recommend this game to any avid RPG fan.			"

												Words connot describe the experience of playing this game. Once you get past the steep learning curve and begin to grasp the basics, you simply cannot put it down. Although very difficult, after every boss attempt there remains a feeling of ""ONE MORE TRY"", and this turns into countless failed attempts that make or break the player. However, the satisfaction of boss kills is something that i have never experienced in a game before. This is game that takes many tries to get into, myself being three, but i could not be happier that i decided to pick it up and give it another shot. Arguably my favorite game ever and i eagerly await Dark Souls 2. 10/10!			"

												There really isn't a game like Dark Souls. It takes (mostly) melee combat and makes it its central piece. It's visceral, it requires careful timing and quick thinking from the player. Landing hits is oh so satisfying. Knowing when to block, dodge or attack is paramount, as a few, unforgiving (but often well-deserved) hits are all that separates the chosen undead from killing an enemy to having to restart from the checkpoint and risking losing all their souls (in-game currency), as they'll disappear from your death spot if you don't pick them up before dying again. Tension buildup is inevitable when you're exploring a new area or trying not to die to recover your 100000+ souls you dropped on your last death. This is the same reason why slaying bosses tastes so much sweeter than in any other game, since there's so much at stake. Multiplayer is also a strong component of the game, in which through diverse items and covenants you can invade (enter someone else’s game) another chosen undead and either help him get through an area and slay the boss or simply engage the invaded player and take his souls and humanity. Again, this plays very well into the whole tension-buildup setup the game goes for. No game is perfect, and Dark Souls does have a few issues: On the game side, the second half of the game (approximately) feels unfinished and rushed, with uninspired areas and bosses; the game’s leveling system lets players with high-end gear invade new players who are in the starting areas, which makes an unfair fight (but really, who hasn’t given in to becoming a level 1 darkwraith?). Technically, this is one of the worst console ports ever made, with locked in-game resolution and framerate (which can be solved with 3rd party patches like dsfix); and of course the networking code, invasions are based on a peer-to-peer system, so running into laggers is inevitable (that is if you manage to invade/get invaded in the first place, since Games For Windows Live does far more harm than good, requiring fiddling with router ports and more 3rd party patches like dscfix). At the end of the day, if you give the game and chance, it will “click” with you, and then you’ll become another victim from the dark curse, discussing and planning character builds and thinking why most other melee-focused combat games just don’t feel right anymore.

												(I'm largely going to skip the talk about GFWL (Games for Windows Live) and the required mods due to cruddy porting. Yes, GFWL is bad. Yes, it has just been replaced (Woo!). Yes, the porting is bad. Yes, it is entirely negligible with the DSfix and even made 100% playable with keyboard and mouse with DSmfix (setups which I'd be right happy to share.)I will probably have to start this review off by saying what everyone says; yes, this game is hard, and it will undoubtedly test you if you're new to the series.However, it will also reward you and your skill (or your exploring), over and over if you're willing to press on, not just with shiny items or souls, but also sometimes with breathtaking atmosphere, stunning landscape views (which in 99% of the cases, are places you'll end up later on, the level design is genius) and heaps of lore if you're into that sort of thing. Even I, who is 450 hours in, and now pushing for 100% completion, get well rewarded for some of the things I go through.Now, after all these hours, I know I can't say this game is completely flawless (aside from GFWL and port issues). I know the flaws. I've seen the flaws. I've talked to parts of the community about the flaws. But I did not see them the first playthrough, or the second, probably not before the third time or so, and honestly I'd say that's a lot better than most games still.I'd like to say that Dark Souls is a rather lonely experience and I'll suggest it should be played as such, at least the first playthrough. In my opinion this contributes to making some of the encounters more atmospheric, more lively, more depressive.As a last word, I wholeheartedly recommend this game, for there are few like it, and hopefully someone dare take the step to try it and falls as much in love with it as I have.

The PvE is pretty good, but the PvP is what can keep a person playing, as the community is still alive and running. If you can't afford Dark Souls 2, you should definitely get Dark Souls 1.

Experience it yourself. Let the failures and succeses teach you. Wonder at the world and its history. This game is not just about making ""consumers"" see the ""content"". Chances are, if you play normally you will not see a good chunk of it, however if you find the hidden gems, you will be awestruck. I applaud the developers for having the courage to realease a game where may be only a persentage of players will appreciate.

												Get ready for the challenge of a lifetime. Things like slaying a demon in the abyss and fighting a horde of giants is your ordinary day with Dark Souls. Its more than an adventure. Its more than an RPG. Its a test of endurance and skill that can set any casual gamer at unease. Fear not, the game sticks to you, and you wont stop until youve beaten it. The variety of weapons and class making makes it an unique experience that you would want to repeat with different classes and weapons. The PC port is horrible and I suggest that you get an Xbox 360 controller and its adapter for PC. Trust me, it is so worth it even if you will never use that controller again. The game forces you to learn and progress, making each victory feel like an accomplishment for you. I'll give it a 9/10.			"

												This is a tricky one to review because the game is simultaneously excellent and terrible.  So let's start with the bad:- It's obtuse.  Fans will claim it's just deep or something you have to learn, but it's not true, the initial learning curve and player training is very poorly handled and will have driven off a lot of new players.- The story.  I have no idea what it was all about, who I was, where I was, what I was doing, or why everyone kept talking in the very, very worst of thee-thou-thine speak.- The voicework is terrible.  Like am-dram into a tape-recorder terrible.- The PC port.  It's perfectly stable and runs fine, but sadly they put the bare minimum effort in and you're stuck using a controller.  With proper mouse control they could have got rid of the locking-on nonsense and with proper keyboard control you could have hotkeyed multiple spells.- There's a few very badly tuned fights where you'll die a lot through no fault of your own.And now the good:- It's challenging in a satisfying way.  It's like an anti-button-masher in that almost every enemy poses a danger if you're not paying attention and instead of elaborate combo attacks you never use, you just have a few basic abilities and it's all about using them at the right time in the right way.- The story.  I know this was also in the Bad List, but one aspect of the story that is good is how it's presented.  A lot of CRPGs force you to sit through page after page after page of turgid dialogue of fan-fic quality fantasy twaddle instead of using the medium they're in to SHOW me the story.  Dark Souls lets you experience the story, it doesn't tell you it.- The world and the art.  It's pretty enough, but most of all it's inventive and some of the locations and monsters are hugely imaginative.  There's more creativity here than in a thousand tedious Dragon Age games.- The mimic chests are excellent.  Right out of a Tim Burton movie.			"

There are areas in the game I simply loathe. And yet, I can't stop playing this. Dark Souls hooks you in and when you're in, there's no going out. Once your soul goes Dark it never goes back.That being said, a good controller and a ton of patience are required. It is possible to go through without either, but why would you? The game is designed for controller, so play it on controller. And the game is designed through trial and error, so be patient. Anyone can beat it if they try hard enough.

												Dark Souls is a special game.  Like that one album that made radio hard to listen to, this game raised the bar for millions and created a hunger that, to date, only From Software has been able to satiate.I would encourage everyone to not be discouraged by the legends of its punishing difficulty.  While the learning curve is steep at first, once the player attains fluid control over their character they will enjoy one of the most satisfying combat systems in any game ever made.  The timing windows are somewhat tight, but there's a sublime feeling that comes with perfect dodging, parrying and riposting.  Once you learn the Soulsborne combat system, it can tough to go back to other games.The combat is just one facet of this gem of a game.  The world design is top-notch - there's a delicate sense of beauty to be found within the desolate and oppressive game world.  The level design (especially the first half of the game) is fantastic - not only are the environments varied but there are shortcuts to reward exploration.  Sound design and music are excellent and immersive.  The lore of the game is deep and interesting, but is only hinted at through various dialogues, item descriptions and corpse locations.  The DLC that's included with the PTDE is some of the best DLC ever released.  Both new areas are interesting and at least 3 of the best and most difficult boss fights are found there.This game gets my highest recommendation.			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I love this game, but...Dark Souls requires patience.The game requires caution when confronting enemies, practice when learning the controls, reckless exploration when learning the world, and careful consideration when learning (yes, learning) the story.  There is absolutely no hand holding.There are no objectives.  There are barely even any NPCs saying, ""You should go this way, hint hint.""  When you start, you just broke out of prison and a giant crow drops you off in front of a dude that says you should go ring some bells.  He mentions two, which is actually the game's third cruel joke on the player.  If you don't know where to go, the only way to learn is to visit places that you should not, get killed instantly, and wonder if you'll ever be able to go there again.  This is why so many people visit the graveyard, get slashed to pieces, and quit the game forever.But honestly, once you figure out the correct direction (up), the game is actually kind of forgiving in it's own way.  You're slowly introduced to the easiest mobs in the game, and every new encounter introduces you to a new mechanic.  By the end of the Undead Burg, you've almost seen every attack strategy in the game.  This a great time to learn how to step back and find openings.But I digress.  This is also indicative of one of the major issues with Dark Souls.  Too much energy has been spent by folks explaining the first part of the game because it's a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  The lack of guidance is *so* unforgiving that the internet has had to fight to get people not to quit right away.  ""No, seriously.  The game is awesome.  Just stick with it!  Please!  What are you doing?  Stop beating me with your controller!""Yes, we've all heard the same thing.  ""Once you improve at the game, you'll see it for how beautiful it is!""Though this is true, I totally understand why people quit, and I think it ultimately is a subtle but crippling design flaw.  Yes, the game attempts to prepare you for its difficulty but it also intentionally disregards the player's likely prior experience with third-person action games.We don't only expect to be able to hack and slash at enemies, we expect that when we do, we will lock to the enemy.  Then, we can hit the same button (usually a thumb button) over and over again until we've exhausted our animations.  Not only that, but we expect to be relatively invincible during this flurry.  Then we can dodge, right?  All over the place!  Run from here to there; make sure that we can't be hit.  Healing?  That should be instant.  At the very least, it should stop the rest of the game until it completes.Nope.I believe the game could have been greatly improved if it would have put a little bit more content in that was intended to help the player unlearn bad habits from previous game mechanics.  Players should go into this game knowing that movement and combat are extremely precise and deliberate.  Precise.  Collisions are as they appear.  If you swing your sword and it diagonally misses the left ear of the skeleton you're fighting:  Sorry, no, you didn't actually hit it.  Prepare for punishment.But oh well.  It was awesome once I got it down.  I'm on my third play through.			"

												Dark Souls is actually a not very hard game, well actually it's painfully hard almost as if I had to use my tears as payment for progression in the game. I say the game is not hard because it just makes you realize how stupid you are at times, rushing into combat half-cocked or something like that. You always need to prepare (to die) for any and every fight you may get into. I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge and change of gameplay. (You need to play this game very differently than say, Skyrim for example) 10/10 (should have been GOTY)			"

												This is the kind of game you love to hate.This is probably one of my favorite games of all time, and yet whenever I stop to think about it, I realize that I absolutely hate playing through at least three quarters of it. There are areas in the game I simply loathe. And yet, I can't stop playing this. Dark Souls hooks you in and when you're in, there's no going out. Once your soul goes Dark it never goes back.That being said, a good controller and a ton of patience are required. It is possible to go through without either, but why would you? The game is designed for controller, so play it on controller. And the game is designed through trial and error, so be patient. Anyone can beat it if they try hard enough. Just don't give up and praise the sun! \[T]/			"

												Arguably the greatest game ever made, Dark Souls is atmospheric, complex and beautiful.Your story begins in an asylum where the undead are locked up, never to be seen again, to await the end of the world. That was the plan anyway, but a mysterious figure drops a key into your cage, allowing you to leave the asylum. This marks you as the chosen undead, fated to undertake a pilgrimage to Lordran, land of the ancient Lords.And Lordran is one of the best fantasy worlds ever represented in a video game. Once a magnificent kingdom ruled by gods, Lordran has been overrun by the undead. Yet it still retains its amazing variety, as your quest will take you to forests, swamps, castles, towns, blazing infernos and silent primordial lakes. Lordran's incredibly detailed verticality (indeed you are always travelling up or down) means that the game feels beautifully interconnected and coherent, as you seamlessly walk from one area to the next, uncovering shortcuts that connect to earlier and later locations along the way.Lordran is also a perilous place, and every single enemy is capable of killing you with ease if you're not being careful. In spite of this, the game seldom feels unfair: you lose all your stuff when you die, but if you get back to the place where you were killed - without dying again - you can get it back. This is to say nothing of the bosses. Dark Souls' legendary bosses are in many ways the souls of the areas they inhabit. Every boss fight (ok, Pinwheel excepted...) requires a careful study of the boss' movements and the arena where you're fighting to build up, over the course of many deaths, a strategy to take down the boss. And there are myriad strategies you could construct to take down any given obstacle, since the game mostly rewards all playstyles and equipment choices equally: it is very possible to beat the game using the very first weapon by upgrading it as you go along.All of this is backed up by a story and lore that are revealed slowly, and only when you go looking for them, in conversations with NPCs, description text for items, and the enemies and locations themselves. Nor is the lore ever revealed completely, so the game always feels compellingly shrouded in mystery.Brilliant, right?			"

												Its more fair than real life.Seriously tho. If you find modern day AAA games to be a cakewalk at default and padded with artificial difficulty at higher levels (bullet sponges, 2 hit kills.... you name it) then you will like this game. It doesnt BS you with some fake difficulty and catapults you into the game world whose history you will likely not understand until NG+2.GameplayDont get the wrong impression and run away now though. The actual PvE combat mechanics is very well balanced. The mobs will die few whacks and so will you. So once you learn the mechanics and patterns of the enemies. The game becomes considerably easier to manage and you'll likely not die at all provided you're careful.The area can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to navigate and there's hidden nooks and crannies(ph4tloots included) everywhere.So its a nightmare for the forgetful gamer. Getting lost mid-map is mandatory. You might wanna skip to a guide if you dont really have the time. I cant say much about the PVP but be prepared to face laggers and cheap strat ""meta"" no lifers taunt-after-every-killers. The connection is P2P. Theres no dedicated server. (more lag yaayyyyy)[PC Port troubles]What can I say? This is a console game ported to PC by popular demand so the interface sucks big goblin donger and gets crammy really quick. The default mouse+kb control is unusable(mod fix) If you want to play at 60fps 1080p you will also need to dl a mod.In the end you will get frustrated. You will forget that frustration once you rekt that a-hole boss after 10 deaths. You will get frustrated again...etc...But is the feeling at the end worth? DefinitelyPraise/10 "

												You will die, repeatedly, and then some. The game never tells you where to go, what to do or how you should do something. This is simply leant by your death, over and over. Everything seems like an achievement from finding a new area, a hidden item or learning how to upgrade your weapon. Dying warrants the respawn of mostly everything you’ve just painstakingly killed. The combat mechanics can be cumbersome at times. You can kill the NPCs...permanently. This game is not perfect by any means, but it is simply one of the best games you will ever play. Every complexity\difficulty\flaw somehow seems to add a characteristic you will learn to love. The game becomes manageable only by your improvement as a player and not by the game getting any easier. This is truly an amazing game, one of the best ever made.			"

The story is rich and amazing. You will have hours upon hours of fun on this game. Even when you beat it you are presented with a new challenges.

												Ah.. Dark Souls.. You have given me my highest and lowest times in my gaming history. With every moment of joy, you will punish me in ways I never knew could happen. After finally killing that boss.. to being pushed off a cliff by a weak hollow.You will get angry, you will die but you will push on.Dark Souls drops you off into a strange land with very little to go on and sends you on your way. The open world allows you to wander into areas far beyond your skill but as you master the game these areas will allow you to choose how you tackle the start of the game in new and challenging ways.The depth of the story is a bit hard to take in on your first few playthroughs but as you listen more and more you will start to see the world unfold before you.The npcs add a nice and manic flare to the atmosphere, often mocking you or giving you vague information on what you could be doing next. They don't treat you like a hero, you are just some other hollow, passing through, like the rest of them.The amount of gear you can aquire allows for very unique character development and style choice  Meta aside , making it so no 2 characters are the same.This is one of the best games I have ever played and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to take a hit to their ego.

												Mechanics: Mysterious at first but once you figure them out you can become unstopable. Parrying and backstabs are essential to success but it felt like you needed to rely to much on them. The combat is fluid, the difficulty is good, and the areas are amazing.Story: It's story isn't clear yet it is amazing. The game tells you the premise and reason you are there and then lets you piece the rest out by your self. You will find characters that you will learn to love and help or learn to destroy and kill.Pacing: First you have your typical tutorial level but it isn't as easy as most tutorials. After that you are left in an open world and told to ring 2 bells. 1 above and another below. It's your decision to which to ring first though many chose the top side. After finding secrets, obtaining weapons, and hacking away at enemys you are met with a new boss to over come. Whether it be a demon or animal, you shall overcome it.Summary: The game is with flaws but they don't detract for what you will be expirencing. You shall face the invicible and the strong but they will not stop you from fulfilling your destiny. Just don't go hollow...PvP: I left this for last because it's extremly diffrent. In human form you may summon and get invaded by people. Being human gives you no real buffs except for summons. Having humanity in your counter though can give you some buffs like loot drop chance and curse resistance. Being human is both bad and good. You can get invaded by people 10+ of your level and some below your level. Some area, like the forest, have none to little PvP restrictions, so a 150 SL and invade a 120 SL. Covenants exist to enhance the PvP like the darkmoons (Police), Darkwraith (Hunter of humanity), Gravelords (MESS YOU UPers), and Forest Hunters (Guardians of the forest). What you use in PvE is used in PvP but some weapons are better for one or the other. When it comes to weapons it's really just what you like and succeed with. The PvP is fun and fast paced but has some problems with lag and gankers (People who summon 2 people who all gang up on an invader). You will occasionally encounter some of these problems but they are few and far between.9/10			"

No one should miss out on this masterpiece. 10/10Some might argue that this game is unforgiving and too frustrating, but games in essence are supposed to be a challenge.

Now, turn off all compliant HID controllers(There may be more than one) and your good to go. simple.Fix graphics/framerateMany people suggest going to the Nexus site for this mod fix, but I have a better source( A more secure source). Go to the site http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfixnow, put this in your steam folders and make *SURE* to*BISABLE* the cloud sync properties in your game so the fix doesn't get  erased, this file *Must* be put in the data file *OR* just somewhere where the executable is.

												Difficulty is not to be the major point of this game, for it is unjust to see it as only that.Dark Souls is a lore-driven set piece, new to the addition of the Souls series, without major additions, save for gameplay variables and community accumulation to where popularity is at an all time high.The story is well written, but the majority of NPC's greatly drive force from Demon's Souls, to where they're even a direct copy set in a new reality, as it is. However well the backstory is for them, and how enjoyable it is to see their reactions upon your actions, much of the lore is told throughout item descriptions, which is primarily shoe-horned in, save for a quick explanation of nothing more than, ""You had a history before the Asylum!""The game is great, and the graphical department impresses me even to this day, but it is clearly blantantly copying what has gotten them far with Demon's Souls, with putting forth something else simply because.That does not make it less enjoyable, however. The gameplay still makes me have fun, throughout all the circumstances that I've gone through, and overall, I find myself coming back to it, again and again. If you wish to buy this game and haven't played Demon's, then by all means. You shall have a fresh experience, one which I hope you enjoy. Welcome to Dark Souls, for losing is fun here.			"

												Amazing game. I have already played 150+ hours and I plan to play much more. This game has such an intricate story but hardly reveals itself. Also this game leaves the player with choice on where to go, but the other areas might be harder so you go the way it was intended. 9.9/10 Not perfect... But still great.			"

												Pre-review note: I have actually beaten Dark Souls but only on the PS3Pros:- A good RPG system that reflects your fight style- Strategy is definitely needed when fighting groups or boss fights- Summoning AI when offline- Saving AI actually benefits you very well- Fantastic story- online community is really good, perhaps the best Ive ever seenCons:- Glitches in combat such as enemies being able to attack through structures- Online invasions can be really cheap sometimesOver all amazing game and its one of my favorite series. It can be really cheap sometimes but its still worth trying out especially if you like RPG's10/10			"

												Let me start off by saying that Dark Souls isn't a game for everyone. It can be extremely hard and frustrating at times. Also, playing this game with a gamepad is STRONLY recommended. The PC controls are clunky and poorly optimized, and.. well let's just say that this game won't like that..  With that said, let's move on.Dark Souls is an open-world RPG, that won't hold your hand throughout the game like most games do these days (looking at you, Skyrim). The combat is fantastic, but can be complex at times. It's defenitely not the 2 button-mashing system that other games use. (Still looking..) The game will require your full attention, every single second. Losing your concentration will result in death 9 out of 10 times. But even if the game has your full concentration, there is a great chance that you'll die (especially on your first playthrough). But dying is normal in Dark Souls. Because dying will teach you a lesson. And that's what  Dark Souls is about. Trial and error. The first time you meet a boss and you die you'll think it was an unfair battle, you didn't know what to do. The second time though, you'll know better. And once you figure out you're own perfect strategy and you beat the boss, you'll be rewarded greatly by the game. And you'll feel fantastic. That's a feeling not many games can give you these days. So if you take some of your time to master this game, it will feel like a breath of fresh air. Just try it, if you dare.(Apologies for possible grammar mistakes, English isn't my main language)			"

												Dark Souls is a game that doesn't hold your hand, and doesn't want you to want it to. It's a game you learn from experience(read trial and error), or you learn from the community.Myself? I mainly got it from the community. A couple of buddies and some wiki-ing made this game that was once an intimidating cliff into an invigorating hike through the hills. It's not a way to ruin the game, to get others to help you (be it through ""how do I beat this boss?"" or reading a wiki about how to find a certain crafting item); it's simply a different way to play it and enjoy it.This game has the most satisfying combat, one of the most compelling subtle worlds, some seriously cool loot, and an unconventional and interesting multiplayer system.It has it's negatives, certainly; the PC port was not good (DSFix is practically mandatory), Games for Windows Live is not a selling point, the camera can be temperamental, and when you're not progressing it can feel a bit hopeless. BUT; all these things are really a testament to how good the game is because despite all these flaws the game shines through - it's truly grossly incandescant.Bring on Dark Souls 2!			"

												You will play this game and you will hate it. You will call it clumsy and unfair and rage quit at the first possible opportunity, but then you'll decide to pick it back up and try again. Why? Because you don't want the game to have the last laugh, and that drive pushes you through hell and back while you slowly improve.It's got solid combat that can best be described, as cliche as it sounds, tough but fair. It rewards patience, knowledge of your weapon and enemies, and skill. Once you understand how everything works the combat is a lot of fun. On top of that you have a lot of options in terms of builds and playstyle, and while some are better than others you have a lot of flexibility to be viable.Once you've gotten past the difficulty of the game you begin to rage less and really enjoy yourself. You start to really appreciate the world, level design, NPCs, and subtle story that makes Lordran so captivating to explore time and time again. Don't give up on this game so easily, it's one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had in a video game.			"

												A modern day masterpiece.Im not new to the series having previously done everything possible in Demon Souls....I'd went several NG+ deep, held every weapon, reached well in excess of SL250 and farmed souls to the point where losing 4 million souls meant absolutely nothing, all as part of a 15-20 hour search just for the ever elusive Pure Bladestone. Dark Souls does everything Demon Souls did but on a grander scale. The nexus is a thing of the past with more traditional progression through the area making it feel more like a world than a series of selectable areas / levels. There's a heavy covenant theme throughout the game, many are easily missable as there well off the beaten track. There are NPCs which will sporadically pop up during your playthrough provided you fulfill very specific conditions and for the most part meet them at a set point during progression through the game.What is retained is the outstanding sense of atmosphere. Blighttown & The Depths are Dark Souls equivalent of the Valley of Defilement from Demon Souls, an area where early game you'll spend most of your time either poisoned, toxic, cursed or all three. Tomb of the Giants with its almost complete darkness hiding oversized skeletons up until the point where they attack, Darkroot Basin & Darkroot Garden with Alvina the Forest Covenant leader looking like a nod to something from Alice in Wonderland. The Crystal Cave, Demon Ruins, Lost Izalith, The Catacombs, The Painted World of Ariamis, Anor Londo....there all fantastic, so unique and defined in the game world with completely unforgettable mini bosses / bosses.The gameplay mechanics are generally as was in Demon Souls, load created by equipped items and stamina / strength stats still play a huge part, go over 50% and you fat roll, go even higher and your character will just squirm on the spot when you tap roll, mobility as before is key. If you can get to them the game throws high level armour sets and weapons at you very early on, there so high though you're unable to use them effectively. During my initial playthrough I fealt like I barely scratched the game, I used several weapons out of more than likely 50+ which reside in my inventory, used 3 or 4 armour sets, used 3 or 4 rings predominantly chosen specifically for boss fights or locations. I believe I used one spell out of a vast amount, that being Iron Flesh to tank the Sanctuary Garden boss - the scope to play the game in your own way is almost overwhelming.To touch on the multiplayer, its still active, people still drop the old troll signs telling you to jump off cliff faces to fantastic treasure etc, for the best example of how unique the multiplayer is googling ""Dark Souls The Wall"" leaves nothing to the imagination.Very few games nowadays keep me compelled to the point where I can't put them down, Dark Souls is one of them.

												Dark Souls is widly known as a game that causes undying rage in many of its players as well as being an awful pc port. These may be true, however there are allot of things that the people who dont play it because of this lose out on. Dark Souls is an incredible game overall. The story is amazingly deep and with all of the lore that exists in the game, it creates a world that you truly feel has existed long before you came around and long after you leave. Every character that you see on screen and even allot that you don't see on screen. All have huge impacts on the world around you and allot of people overlook this because of the games dificulty. For example you could find a body with some armor on it and not think twice. But if you look into it more you may find that the person who's armor it was had a huge impact on where you are and where the world is now and you had the misfortune/fortune to run into their grave.The gameplay itself works smoothly enough though a controller is strongly reccommended because of the pc ported controls being bad and not well explained. Most all of the movements in the game are very smooth, everything from parries to backstabs are all pleasing to the eye as well as very satisfying when you land them. You will die allot in this game, thats a given and something even mentioned in the title ""Prepare to Die"". But the greatest part of this game and why I personally find the dieing acceptable is because of the sense of acomplisment you get when you succeed. Killing a boss in this game is more than something you can just shrug off, its a huge acomplisment to kill a boss after dieing to it ten times before. To finally see on the screen ""Boss Defeated"" is a huge thing and can bring giant smiles and cheers to some. The sheer acomplisment alone makes this game worth while. The entire way you craft your character is very different to normal rpg's. You start with the regular builds, but as you go through the game your able to work towards whatever you want. You can start out a mage and end as a tank with the heaviest weapons and armor in the game if you'd like. This ""Class system"" makes gameplay allot different from other rpg's. Even better in my opinion is the opressive feeling you get when you have allot of souls (The ingame xp and currency) and are walking back to a bonfire, anything can happen and it gives you a very nervous feeling because you just killed a boss to get all of these and you dont want to lose them to a small enemy before you get to use them. So the atmosphere can change rapidly, and because of the soul system allot of people get turned off because that is what is rage inducing about the game. But getting past it makes you feel like you have truly acomplished something.As far as multiplayer however this game comes up a little short. The ability to see other people as translucient phantoms is amazing, getting to see the blood stains of other players in real time and seeing how they died is great. Or even sitting at a bonfire and seeing someone else sitting with you is good because it all makes you feel much less alone and lets you know others are going through what you are too. As far as the match making system for the party and invasions system is concerned however is another story. If you were hoping to co-op with a friend in this game, you will have a rough time. The game uses a peer to peer match making system which is a little flawed because of the time it can take for you to see a friends summon sign. Even more annoying can be the invasion system which allows others to invade your world when you are a human and slay you for your souls and humanity. Because you need to be human to summon others into your world for the boss fights, this can clash against the invasion system and allot of the time you will get invaded before you can even see your friends summon sign to bring them to your world.Overall this game is extremely well thought out in lore, setting a perfectly dark tone which suits the game and the atmosphere. The way the game has you interacting with other players is creative and inovative but the co-op aspect is slightly lacking. The Third Person RPG style gameplay is amazing and will keep you coming back for more every time along with the amazing boss fights (Save for 2 of them) that make you feel great when you finally defeat them. This is an amazing game which allot of people pass up for fear of its reputation as either a bad port or as a terribly difficult game. But, id reccomend this game to anyone who likes dark and very deep story lines, the very strong gameplay and ""Class system"" or lack there of and who want a little more challenge than the average game. Personally I give dark souls a 10/10 but that could be just me.			"

												Generally, I play games on normal difficulty. Sometimes I drop it down to easy, because I'm a filthy casual. I didn't think I'd enjoy this game but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I started.The world is beautiful (once you get DSfix) in a run down way. It starts out with fairly typical undead ruins but gets weirder from there. The lore is largely unspoken, it is relayed through descriptions on items and how the world works. This is similar to the database in the first Mass Effect and I love it here just as much.The gameplay is tough. My first learning experience was near the start of the game. I had amassed a sizable amount of Humanity (a resource used in the game for various things) and because it increases item find I thought it'd be good to use it all. This means that I could lose it if I died, but I figured I'd have no problem getting to my bloodstain (which restores your lost Humanity and Souls). Then I met the first boss. He killed me. A lot. And then I died on the way back before I could get my bloodstain. All those Souls and Humanity - gone. I got mad. I stopped playing for the night. But I came back with an altered mindset: the only thing you lose by dying is whatever you choose to risk. Once I got into that mindset death doesn't bother me as much, although I am still cautious. I can see the effects of getting better at the game mechanics. I can see the benefit of my improved arms and armor. I ""broke through the wall"".It was worth it.			"

												This game took me 90 hours to get into. It was mostly false starts before my brain got distracted, which it often does. That said; started replaying this a few weeks ago, and something just clicked. All the prior trial and error attempts had sunk much of the gameplay into my brain; where early items were, what to do in general. It all was ingrained somewhere along the way and this time around, I found myself able to dive in.There is a great deal to take in for this game, and honestly without a lot of help from a good friend and some very detailed wikis (which I only look up after roughly...5 failed attempts at a spot), not sure I'd get as far as I have.  Much of the legendary difficulty of this game is learning about...well, everything. What makes pyromancy different from sorcery, what it means to ""fat roll"", what damage type is good against which enemy, ect. These are things that have to be beaten into you. And once that all settles, or you know how to figure it out; it just becomes being able to make it through the other side of the battle. The only thing that will stop you, it seems, is you.The online scene at this point seems to have simmered down to a mostly good natured lot; from my experiances anyways. I got invaded at one point, the person and I bowed and then they threw lightening spears in my face. Good fight. And then I ended up summoning them to help with Orenstien and Smough. One of those experiences that I can't say I'd get from any other game. So if you've been on the fence about this franchise, please at least give it a try if you see it on sale. It may take time for it to click, it may frustrate the hell out of you for a while. But when it does click, when you begin to see how it works, you'll be rewarded with one of the richest and fulfilling gaming experiances in recent memory.  "

												This game.Let me tell you some things.First of all, yes it is challenging (especially at first), yes it will make you rage at times (more often than not) and yes you probably will die (quite often). As it says on the tin: Prepare To Die. Even if you really don't want to :)Now you may ask, ""But why would I want to play a rage-inducing, unforgiving game like this?"". Simple. Again and again, it washes away the tears, sweat and pain that you accumulate on your treacherous journey and delivers an incredible experience through a combination of incredible surroundings, enemy designs and a highly rewarding gameplay.Honestly, this game looks absolutely beautiful. I have found myself exploring areas for hours while discovering the odd treasure or secret pathway. The scenery has a great amount of detail and looking towards the horizon from an elevated position will always be incredible in this game. The only loading screens that you will ever see will be mostly the ones after you die, the others cut-scenes while moving to different worlds or encountering a boss. Most of the areas are seamlessly connected and really give out the feeling of an open world.Dark Souls' gameplay is very satisfying and rewarding. The feeling you get when you do your first backstab, your first parry, finally killing that boss that mocked you for hours on end, etc... There is a real sense of accomplishment in this game. Every fight can cost you your life, and if you get too careless doing crazy rolls you might just accidentally end up diving off of a cliff. Then comes the facepalm, the mourning of your lost souls and the quest to get back to the place where they were dropped, swearing that you won't die stupidly like that again... again.The only background music you'll find is during boss fights. That doesn't mean there isn't any background noise. The atmosphere and ambient sounds clearly change with your surroundings, from cursed underground cities to sunny ruins. You are deeply immersed in whichever location you find yourself in, allowing you to hear every movement around you. The music while fighting a boss contributes to the intensity of the moment, filling you with epic despair as you try to maintain your focus.NPC characters will prove to be few and invaluable, although their lives will always be in your hands. Kill them and they are gone until you get to new game+. Your choices in who you help and who you kill or betray will have an impact on your progression, which items/spells will be available to you, who will help you out in times of need and who will turn on you. These are all people with their own story, fighting for a cause... or not. Just like you. So what will you do?The leveling system is different from most RPGs. You basically upgrade your character's stats with the souls that you amass, which are also used as currency for items and upgrading your equipment. Upgrading strength enough for example will allow you to wield heavy weapons such as great-swords while intelligence will make you able to cast a wide range of powerful sorceries.The story has a lot of depth, though that may not be apparent at first as it leaves much to speculation, blurring the lines between good and evil in this world and who is right or wrong. There is a great amount of lore in this game and the NPCs stories will often intertwine with eachother and your own. I would highly recommend reading about the story and lore of the Dark Souls universe if you get into it, otherwise you are missing out on some amazing stuff and theories that will blow your mind.I don't want to spoil any of this amazing game, so let's go on to the technical aspects:As the notice says, I would recommend using a controller while playing Dark Souls. It was made for consoles only initially and we all know the PC port was rushed. The resolution on PC is only 32bit. Aside from that, having a friend join you for some jolly co-operation is great fun.All in all, this is probably one of my favourite games of all time and I eagerly await more from the Dark Souls series. 10/10 would die again. And again. And again.			"

												""I was given HIV at a young age due to rampant child prostitution in my native country. Thankfully, I was able to escape, and have since lived out my day-to-day life in poverty in the slums of Hoboken, NJ, barely able to afford my AIDS treatment. However, one day, while perusing this website at my local internet cafe (they luckily accept government cheese as payment) I happened across Dark Souls. The cover, bearing an American flag and a zesty-looking cheeseburger piqued my interest immediately, partially due to the fact that I hadn't eaten in days. I purchased the game using a stolen credit card I found in a fat man's asscrack, and began to play.Almost instantly, I felt my cavernous ♥♥♥♥♥♥ begin to tighten--the open sores on my face and neck ruptured and healed almost instantly. I was transformed into a gorgeous, curvaceous woman--my breasts growing to double the size they were before.

Now I'm dating a man with a♥♥♥♥♥♥the size of an aircraft carrier, who owns several yachts and a mariachi band. Life is good, and I have this game to thank.So, Miyazaki, if you can read this from your throne amongst the gods, I'd like to offer you my sincere gratitude. Let this glowing review remain on Steam eternally, a undying testament to this game's infinite glory. Thank you."" - Jeff.			"

												A deep and immersive RPG set in a noir medieval european setting. The game is focused around it's almost flawless combat system that works great for advanced 1-on-1 battles. The only downside is that the PC port of the game is horrible, but a few modders from the community have made the mods DSfix and DSCfix that make the port bearable and even better than the console version on some occasions. Bring a lot of patience as well as your wits with you.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E17 Dark Souls 

			Views: 101		

			The dark fantasy world of Dark Souls is rich with intriguing lore and atmosphere, if you can make it past the unique take on controls and take a special interest in learning the game and its...		

Dark Souls: Dark Souls is like that date that went decently well, maybe you said some dumb things but, you felt pretty good about the date overall. Then the date ignores you outright and, never returns your calls. Do you stop pursuing altogether or, make a more concentrated effort and maybe change up your game to try and score another date, maybe, a better one. Dark Souls is the game series that is infamous for its unforgiving gameplay and dark setting with the main point being you dying over, and over, and over. A refreshing take on the action roleplaying formula, dark souls is a unique mix of role-playing, exploration and anger management. Told next to nothing about practically anything, you are dropped in the world of dark souls, given a brief tutorial on the controls and expected to march forth and succeed. There is something to be said for gameplay over story and Dark Souls definitely capitalizes on the gameplay and mechanic aspect and fails badly at the story aspect. Dark Souls’ combat mechanics is simple to grasp but has a hidden layer of depth and strategy that you learn all on your own. Combining magic, different armors, weapons and so forth you will easily come up with a variety of different builds of characters that all are fully capable of succeeding in the world of Dark Souls. Gameplay and the combat mechanics as well as a superb level design makes learning Dark Souls the challenge it has been cracked up to be but, one that is fair and rewarding. The lore and atmosphere is also worth noting and it makes exploring this world a treat and getting further into the game very rewarding. The main games fault is its vagueness; Instead of igniting mystery and intrigue it often leaves you with more questions to ask than answer and when the game fails to mention basic game mechanics (such as jumping) there is something to be said for being a challenge and just flat out not telling you anything. Unfortunately, a lot can be gleaned it great detail from the awesome wiki sites, however, video games shouldn’t rely on the fan wikis to tell you critical information. Overall, Dark Souls is a challenge, one I find to be harsh at times but, fair and always part of the overall experience. The PC port is pretty awful, don’t buy the game without having a controller on hand to use or you will suffer the wrath of terrible key binding, limited video and audio options and much more. Also the vagueness of basic game mechanics as well as background and story can also lead to frustration and can be hard to find reason to continue on when you are unsure of why you are even there in the first place. However, if you are remotely intrigued by Dark Souls and are up for a challenge then it is easily worth the $20.00 USD. Keep your convictions strong and with a little bit of patience and determination you too can join the ranks of the Dark Souls. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition stays true to it's name. First off, it does not have the best graphics and the controls can be a little clunky at times with wishy washy dodging and very weighty weapons swings, but that adds to the game's very intense, but not impossible, difficulty. Prepare to die since you will, many times. Especially at Sen's Fortress with the gOD DAMN SNAKE ♥♥♥♥♥ES WITH THEIR ♥♥♥♥IN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T AND THE GOD DAMNED GUILLOTINES THAT KNOCK YOU INTO DEATH WITH THE COBRA ♥♥♥♥ERS THAT SHOOT ELECTRICITY AND THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WHO THROWS FIREBALLS AT YOU THAT KNOCK YOU AROUND WHICH MAKE YOU FALL BACK DOWN TO THE GUILLOTINES WHICH KNOCK YOU OFF AGAIN AND AFDIOASHDGAOLFGBASBDLGJKBASJDBLFNJKLGSFG9PWE7FGVIOGBIULSo all in all a very good, solid game with some minor problems. 9/10			"

												I believe that this game tries to aspire to be an ""Nintendo Hard"" game; a game with a learning curve that will punish the player until they 'learn' how the game, locations, and bosses funcion. Due to this, it turns off many people who arn't familiar with the 'souls-borne' series of games. This game isn't going to hold your hand, it's not going to be nice to you, it will kick you in the face as hard as it can and you will learn to dodge that kick given time. The very nature of dark souls is to teach the player how to compleate a task without really ever directly telling them how to do said task; Every boss, location, and enemy is basically a puzzle, a puzzle with no instructions that expects you to pick up the pieces each time you make a mistake. Do yourself a solid, DON'T spoil the game for yourself, the first playthrough is always the one that sticks with you.			"

												Now, I've only just bought this game after achieving The Dark Soul achievement on Xbox 360. That's how good it is - I've 100% completed it on one platform after experiencing it and, after countless death after death after falling off of a bridge or ledge countless times eventually learnt this game how it's meant to be learnt; through the game force feeding you until you figure it out because until then you will just be a lone sheep amongst a pack of wolves. I want that again. I want the thrill of relearning the game because of the new controls and reachieving that unique feeling of ""OHMYGODHOWTHEHELLDIDIJUSTWIN"" after beating a seemingly impossible area boss because you applied attributes that you'd learnt over trial and error what works against that particular boss. Well there's my personal praise to the game, now for the actual review (even though that was a review):Despite what SO many people say, this game has an incredibly deep story and lore behind it. You just need to really want to know it and look for it because you're literally thrown from your nice little asylum of safety into a world where you're alone, and not many people are friendly. Take away what little you find out from NPC's (which is probably where all those people stopped at with their search) and you need to read through item descriptions or pay close attention to little details in the game and afterwards you'll be sitting there in awe of the lore of it all. If you're here, then no doubt you've already heard how hard this game is. The thing is, it's only hard until you apply the skills it teaches you and then it gets relatively easy. Not ""oh I won't die again"" easy because it's literally impossible to go through this game without dying, and everyone can be overwhelmed by numbers or make simple mistakes that will cost you your experience until you recover it.Anyway, as I've shown I absolutely love this game and recommend it to anyone wanting a good thrill10/10			"

												The game where blindly running around and spamming buttons gets you absolutely nowhere.Lordran, a world where you can go almost anywhere at anytime you choose.. assuming of course you don't get killed by the various enemies and bosses.There are enough weapons, armor, spells, miracles and pyromancies to satisfy all playstyles.. but remember, hacking away and hoping for results is the quickest way to the grave, so be mindful, pay attention and learn from the mistakes you make and you will end up defeating even the mighty Gwyn, Lord of Cinder in the end!(Controller while not needed is highly recommended for this game.. so pick one up and avoid the frustration of clunky keyboard & mouse controls!)

Difficulty:Most people who review Dark Souls start with praising the difficulty (or the sun :D), and I will be no exception. While the game is really challenging compared to most games of the newer generations, it's not impossibly hard, as some people make it seem. If you're an old-school player, you could probably instantly name a bunch of DOS games that are harder. Anyway, Dark Souls is a difficult game and it will test your skills and patience.General gameplay:The game plays in a fictional world, called Lordran. After the initial tutorial, you have a huge open world to explore. While the game hints, where you should go next, you are completly free to ignore it. Something that really shines out, is the absolutely wonderful level-design. There are many secret places, and you can find entire maps hidden behind illusionary walls! It's just awesome!Enemies are greatly varied and even include such super awesome mobs as mimics. Bosses are all completly unique both in appearance and mechanics.Combat and controlls:Combat in Dark Souls is complex and slowpaced. It requires you to think strategically, be patient and execute attacks carefully. Often, you're pitted against multiple enemies, each stronger than you. A single mistake can mean death, yet you are able to overcome it. That is the beauty of Dark Souls. You can wield many types of weapons, including all kinds of swords, spears, maces, halberds, knives, bows, crossbows and shields. Something that I've found very cool, is that you can wield any weapon one-handed or two-handed, and switch between the two modes with a click of a button. There are also several spells that you can use (and these work in a D&D style ""limited number of spell casts per rest, instead of regenerating mana"" fashion).Controlls are well designed, but using an XBox 360 controller is a must.Character development:When the game begins, you can create your own character. The options here are rather limited. You can choose your starting class (more on that later), name, gender, face, body and a special item you start with, called gift.Rather than limiting you to one particular class, Dark Souls allows you to develop your character in any way you want. When you level up, you can increase any of the stats you desire. Since the starting classes only differ in starting stats and starting equipment (and lore), you are free to create a build that matches your playstyle. Items are not limited to certain classes either. One can equip any weapon/armor, provided he or she has the neccessary stats.Lore & Story:The game has quite rich lore behind it, but the general story is not put simply in front of you. Most of the lore is found only as item descriptions; the number of cutscenes and dialogs is few. Choices through dialogs are limited, meaning yes/no. There are two endings, but you only choose one or the other at the very end of the game.Online features:Dark Souls is a very special game when it comes to deciding whether it is a multiplayer or a singleplayer game. Most of the time you play alone. However, you can interact with other players. You can summon other players to help you defeat a boss (though soloing one is way more epic :) ), or you can be invaded by other players who will try to kill you (for those who worry about this: you can be invaded only if certain criterias are met). One thing that I really like though, is that even when you play alone, you feel the online elements. Sometimes you can see the ghosts of other players doing their stuff around you. Sometimes you can see the blood of a player who died there; and if you touch the pool of blood, the game will replay how that character had died. My favourite though, is that instead of players annoying each other in some kind of global chat, every player can write short messages on the ground. Now imagine going down in a dark spiral staircase and reading messages like ""Good luck!"", or ""Tears ahead"". It just really adds to the mood.Players can also join so called covenants. These focus on various ascpects of the game, including cooperation, lore, invading other players or punishing those who sinned. There are leaderboards for each covenant for the competative minded.Graphics & Sounds:I usually don't really care about the graphics of a good game, so my opinion may not matter too much. Anyway, I think the graphics are nice. It doesn't pop out of the crowd, like Skyrim that was released around the same time, but it certainly looks good and detailed. One thing to note though, is that the graphicsal settings are very limited without external mods. I mean so limited, that you can't even change the display resolution (it defaults to 720p, 30 fps). Anyone playing this should download the mod called DSFix, where you can freely tweak the rendering settings (along with some neat stuff for those without a controller).Sound effects are detailed and believable. The music is good and goes really well with the setting. Some boss musics are especially memorable. That being said, I still don't consider the soundtrack to be exceptional. I would say, it's about on pair with the graphics (if one can compare two such things as music and graphics).To sum it up:If you like games that challange you, then Dark Souls is certainly a must buy for you. Again, the level design is truly fantastic, and it will definiately take some time for you to beat the game.UPDATE:Now that I've beaten the game I'd like to offer some more info about it.First, while the PvE part of the game is amazing, do not buy it for the PvP, because it sucks. The only thing that matters in PvP is who backstabs who, and that's totally random. Due to the utter-crap network code, you can be backstabbed even while you are meters away, facing the enemy.Second, leveling is implemented in a poor way, as you can become overpowered easily, making the challange go away instantly. There are actually videos about people one-hit-killing bosses. Obviously, this isn't a deal-breaker, but I it's pain to see that even when you meet a new boss for the first time, you can beat it without any trouble. Instead of becomming harder, the game becomes relativly easy after you are roughly half through it. Playthroughs on increased difficulties are easier than expected aswell.			"

												I haven't enjoyed an RPG this much since Oblivion. And even that comparison does it no justice, as it's a much better game than Oblivion. Every aspect of the game complements the others, and it comes together to make a whole that's simply a masterpiece. Despite surface flaws, even glaring surface flaws on rare occassion, the core systems of this game are so solid, and the world and other aspects so masterfully crafted, this is now one of my favorite games of all time.

												Its reputation speaks for itself.Note: The controls for mouse and key board work... but are poorly optimized. The tutorial and menu guides don't even tell you the keys. And the steam controller must be personally customized to be used. "

												Dark Souls 1 is the once-in-a-generation action RPG title that returned to the values of firm-but-fair combat (which, to us candy-arsed gamers of the last decade would be considered insanely difficult) and presented this concept through an incredible world with eclectic enemies and numerous fun ways to stay alive in it. I will make a mandatory plug that you will get the most out of this game by using a modification called DSfix, which allows for more resolution options and fixes frame rate issues. Most die-hard players wouldn't play without it.It should not be understated that this game is an experience in sadism, self-accountability and perseverance. The mechanics of the game are meant to break you to the point where you have to think about timing, patience, and smart  attacks instead of the hack and slash games you might be used to. Aside from the odd enemy attack whacking you through walls, you are taught through its logical composition that your deaths are a direct result of your own actions. Rarely does a game teach you such accountability. I started the game constantly complaining about how the game isn't fair, and ended up just getting mad at myself for poorly reading enemy attacks. And because bosses are unavoidable, you will keep coming back to hand them your♥♥♥♥♥until you finally take theirs. And when you do, it will be one of the greatest accomplishments you will ever feel from a video game.Here is a short list of the best things about this game that should either make you buy it, or replay it: Outstanding sound design. Crystal clear and unique voice acting. Chilling ambience. Full orchestral accompaniments for almost every boss fight to amp up how monumental each fight is for the nourishment of your bruised ego.  Despite a rather esoteric story, the character lines and voice acting is quite memorable. They all have neat storylines that are as bizarre as they are fascinating. Plus they'll usually do great things for you, or you can kill everyone for the cool items they have (that's what new game plus is for!) The covenant system has a host of benefits and unique ways of levelling up in them. They all serve their own purpose, and sweet loot is always a guarantee. The level-up system that encourages the player to find their sweet spot with respect to magical traits and melee combat. It doesn't hurt to learn about what the stats mean before hand, and if it's worth levelling certain stats past a certain point due to diminishing returns to your play style. Gorgeous views. Dark Souls has one of the nicest open world layouts that was well-planned and genius in its execution. The slickest array of weapons, shields, armour sets, and magic spells for you to obsess over, which is owed to comprehensive statistical breakdowns, a sweet weapon upgrade system, unique abilities that are auxiliary to the amount of damage it does or blocks, and just cool-looking stuff. There's a sub community dedicated to the fashion element of the franchise for a reason. Enemies and bosses that will make you laugh, yell, cry, and maybe even aroused. They're all difficult, but hey - that's par for the course. The player base. Whether it's player versus player battles, summoning people to help you through a zone or a boss, or messages on the ground that mix deceit, helpfulness, and hilarity, you have to hand it to the community that makes Dark Souls unlike any other game you've ever played. Overall, just genius level design, and loot stashing. I felt like there were hilarious joke scenarios that the developers put within the game just to mess with you. You'll know it when it happens.The minor things that weren't so great, but in no way detracts from how sweet the game is: So many sweet rings, so few slots for them. You'll occasionally get nicked by attacks through walls and things that weapons shouldn't clip through. But you can exploit it to your own advantage, too. Bonfires you cannot sit at because there are no keepers.On sale, the value is phenomenal - regardless of your skill level, your first play through is going to net you 30-50 hours. The Prepare to Die addition adds some picturesque new zones and three incredibly challenging bosses that will have you banging your desks in delight and rage. Be warned that once the game ends that you will automatically jump into playing the game all over again, so it's important to look up the two things you have to do to unlock the DLC worlds in your first playthrough - otherwise you'll end up playing the game all over again.In the 76 games I've reviewed so far, I have never felt so strongly about  making sure that every person I know who plays video games to give this game a try. It's smart, will ruin your life for a period of time with how much to the game that you can get involved in, and has an original premise and world that you will lose yourself in (in the most delightful of ways). And the best part is that they were able to do it without cramming a story down your throat. Buy it, beat it, and never forget the feeling of true simulated accomplishment as you watch the credits roll as you think about doing it all over again in a different way.			"

												Dark Souls is like a drill sergeant. It yells at you, humiliates you, and stomps on you. But it's all for the better because it makes you stronger/smarter. DS give the greatest sense of accomplishment of any game and combined with amazing minimalist storytelling and a wonderful setting you get one of the greatest games of all time.			"

												This game will kick the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you, but in the process it keeps you coming back for more. One of the most in-depth and rewarding game I have ever played. Replayability is massive, with NG+ or else creating new builds and starting again. The story is hard to figure out, as item descriptions and NPC chats are the only things that advise you on the storyline.Also ♥♥♥♥ blightown Blowdart Sniper and Anor londos archers.10/10.			"

												For those looking for a punishing game of amazing RPG goodness, it doesnt come much better than Dark Souls.This is a very large game, with alot of gameplay to keep you busy. The game is extremely punishing and WHEN you die, oh yes you will die, its because you have made a mistake. But when you get it right the feeling of pure euphoria washes over you, carrrying you onwards towards your next epic win.Never have i felt such extreme rage and extreme happiness in a single title.

												Now, I've only just bought this game after achieving The Dark Soul achievement on Xbox 360. That's how good it is - I've 100% completed it on one platform after experiencing it and, after countless death after death after falling off of a bridge or ledge countless times eventually learnt this game how it's meant to be learnt; through the game force feeding you until you figure it out because until then you will just be a lone sheep amongst a pack of wolves. I want that again. I want the thrill of relearning the game because of the new controls and reachieving that unique feeling of ""OHMYGODHOWTHEHELLDIDIJUSTWIN"" after beating a seemingly impossible area boss because you applied attributes that you'd learnt over trial and error what works against that particular boss. Well there's my personal praise to the game, now for the actual review (even though that was a review):Despite what SO many people say, this game has an incredibly deep story and lore behind it. You just need to really want to know it and look for it because you're literally thrown from your nice little asylum of safety into a world where you're alone, and not many people are friendly. Take away what little you find out from NPC's (which is probably where all those people stopped at with their search) and you need to read through item descriptions or pay close attention to little details in the game and afterwards you'll be sitting there in awe of the lore of it all. If you're here, then no doubt you've already heard how hard this game is. The thing is, it's only hard until you apply the skills it teaches you and then it gets relatively easy. Not ""oh I won't die again"" easy because it's literally impossible to go through this game without dying, and everyone can be overwhelmed by numbers or make simple mistakes that will cost you your experience until you recover it.Anyway, as I've shown I absolutely love this game and recommend it to anyone wanting a good thrill10/10			"

												exelent game, excels in almost every aspect, however it has some flaws, the port is awful, you have to download mods and optimizations to get it running right, GFWL gives a lot of trouble to most people, but when you get past this, you have ensured at least 100 hours of fun, i've been playing this game for 250+ hours and i can't get enought of it, i love dark soulsthe combat:this game has literally the best combat system ever, different moves, parry-riposte, backstabs, bleed, poison... etc. this makes the game worth it just because of the combatenemies:varied, fun and fair, yes, most enemies will kill you, but they'll never 1 hit ko you and they're revealed first, alone, then many and then mixed (pretty mutch like megaman games)Bosses:GREAT boss battles, and here is where the music quicks in, most bosses have their own theme (stray demon - firesage demon - centipede demon , capra demon and taurus demon have repeated themes) and they're awesome, fitting the boss and capture the distress that you have when fighting for your life! However some bosses are flawled, yes, some are frustrating, but in general, they're pretty good fightsAreas:wow the areas in this game, fit the lore and the theme of the game perfectly, most of them dark, but when the light comes in, its perfectly executed, beautiful places to be in, with enemies fitting the areamultiplayer:can be a shore to get it to work, and pvp its a bit flawled, backstabs tend to lag and cause minor frustration, but once you learn how to counter them, you'll have a blast with pvp now, talking about co-op , sometimes is kinda hard to summon someone, but some bossfights are extremely fun to do with a friendconclussion: extremely good game, fun , engaging, hard, visually apealing, it, has almost everything, could use some optimization, defenitely recommended, you won't find a game like dark souls, ever			"
