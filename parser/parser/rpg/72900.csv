												Winter Voices is one of those odd games that you play and don't actually have any fun doing so. You play for the feel of it, the atmosphere, the music, some quirk that intrigues you; but you can't exactly call it -fun-. I took a chance on this one because the premise sounded different and interesting, and I'll admit it delivered on that, but I somehow still feel disappointed. When I look at this game again without my original expectations it's still a quirky piece that feels more like a book rather than a game. The only reason it's a game at all really is to explore the different ways people deal with grief. And maybe that was the whole point to begin with.Basically you're playing as a girl that's not only dealing with the death of her father, but the loss of herself in an incredibly tiny little town. In many ways your story is already written for you before you start playing; the people in town already have a set idea of who you are, something your character isn't really comfortable with. Fights aren't really fights so much as emotional puzzles; you're not actually playing to win just playing to survive. There's this feeling of inevitability and hopelessness that colors the entire game; making it feel more like a study in depression and mental health issues rather than a game. The actual game mechanics themselves are painful in a lot of aspects. The font is tiny, the movement awkward, the system unintuitive, and the gameplay itself is rather dull and boring.However; the story is a beautiful and dark one. You genuinely feel lost yourself, combating these ghosts of your own making and fighting against the perceptions of your fellow villagers. The dialogue is moving and intense, and some of the puzzles are complex and took me more than just a couple of tries. It is definitely a unique experience. In spite of everything I found myself picking this up time and again just to hear the next bit. Like a book so painful and so raw you can only read a few chapters at a time, and although you can't say it's a joy to do so there's this draw to it because it speaks to you somehow.I suppose in short if you're looking for a game to play Winter Voices probably isn't for you. If you're looking for an interactive view into falling down the rabbit hole of depression and feeling uncomfortable the entire time, then yea pick this one up. I debated for a long time whether or not I could honestly recommend this, but in the end it does deliver what it promises; an experience unlike any other. Just leave your expectations at the door, and if you do plan on getting this make sure you do it when there's a sale and it's nice and cheap so you don't feel like you lost out if it ends up not being your cup of tea.Rating this as a 'game': 2/10Rating this as a different experience: 8/10			"

												Truly unique turn-based RPG that doesn't quite reach the potential brilliance of its central conceit, but has enough that's great about it to be worth playing.  You are a girl in a fantasy kingdom trying to piece together your history while overcoming the trauma of your father's death.  All of the upgrades and skills are associated with different psychological ways of dealing with grief and all battles are psychic manifestations of said grief.  That's the brilliant part.  Unfortunately, the writing doesn't always match the game's central, great idea.  It can be vague, meandering, and unbearably pretentious in a super self serious freshman creative writing sort of way, especially at the start, but the plot does pick up significantly around episode 3 (and there's even humor at times, or attempts at it, anyway).  I suspect that the game suffers from a rather poor English localization, which might make the writing seem more stilted and awkward than it is in French (it tends toward the poetic at times, and poetry, like humor, is notoriously difficult to translate, so if you speak French it's probably best to play it in its native tongue).  Once you get acclimated to the stilted language and glacial pacing, however, the story itself is quite interesting in its own small scale and internal way.  This isn't an epic quest about a chosen one trying to save the world.  Just a girl trying to learn about her family while fighting for her own sanity.The battles themselves are fairly well done.  They tend to be rather puzzle like, in that you often have to think about how to use specific skills to accomplish specific goals, rather than just being about pure combat.   Likewise, while they start out fairly simple in the first couple episodes, they can get fiendishly difficult as the game progresses.  This is one game where I highly, highly, recommend hording skill points from level to level and only spending them as you come up against battles that you find unbeatable.  Because the game's skill and stat system is so unique, it will take a bit of trial and error for even experienced RPG players to figure out how things work.  Especially when playing a Max memory Volva character (this game's equivalent of ""hard""), just picking a skill tree and investing in it could very well leave you unable to beat the game at some point.The game did suffer from some huge bugs on release, hence the terrible metacritic reviews, but most of those have been squashed and the developer is very active on the forums to this day and responsive to issues (I found a fix to one bug myself and the dev sent it out as a patch within 24 hours, which was kind of cool). Overall, this is a unique, challenging, turn based RPG that deserves to overcome its terrible launch and become a cult classic.			"

												This is going to be a hard one to review. This is not my type of game. I played it for about 2 hours before I gave up.It's a game similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, with more narrative and less combat. The setting is interesting, and the way the delivery is handled is very good.The artwork is decent. The writing is amazing. But the game is slow-paced and there's a lot of minor things that doesn't grab me. I definitely recommend the game to someone who enjoys adventure games with light combat. If you're into visual novels - a game where the story is 90% of the game, then this is for you. For me, this is like giving a sports game to a nerd. I don't know how to appreciate it.			"

												A great and mature story combined with an absolutely interesting turn-based combat system make for a great formula of a game. The drawback? The game has its share of slow moments, especially in the Prologue, and mainly in the engine (Adobe AIR) and the quite large share of issues you'll likely have with it.But overall, issues aside, it's really fun, and there might also be a Season 2 coming. Be sure to let the developer know in this discussion that we want a proper engine this time around!			"

												The gameplay seems pretty decent (and the battle mechanics particularly interesting), but after thirty minutes or so I've had to set this game aside (at least for the moment) because I simply can't take any more of the purple prose, especially given how often it descends into complete doggerel in what is presumably an attempt to sound ""poetic."" This isn't even remotely funny-bad, as Bulwer-Lytton contest entries, but simply painful-bad, the hail-like slew of obstreperous adjectives hurtling down in contradictory fashion, each a shard of ice with its own unique, cutting edges inflicting a slightly different shape of wound on my suffering literary sensibility, to combine to envelop me in a veil of unseeing mist, muffling prosaic taste with a bitter aftertaste of a poison blade. (On the other hand, if that sentence doesn't bother you, go right ahead and dive in to the game.)			"

												This is a game worth at least trying out, as it shows you an entirely different way of thinking of the whole notion of the RPG as more of a physics puzzle game based upon a skill tree than any standard dungeon grind.Many people criticise this game for its slowness and they certainly have a point, and most of it seems to be flaws with Adobe AIR, the game's poorly-chosen engine.However, part of the slowness is also deliberate. It's a deeply psychological game, built around a core of the sense of loneliness and isolation, even from those who should be friends or even family.Winter Voices is also buggy especially because of Adobe AIR and some levels can seriously take minutes to even start the mission just because the engine is so inefficient, it can't even load the map. The game has an unforgiving side, as well. Skills bought on the skill tree are permanent, and the game likes to spring surprises on you where suddenly, some skills are disabled, and a build that was powerful before suddenly fails.The strong points of this game are story and gameplay. The story is amazing. The protagonist is one of the most relatable characters in recent memory and the dialogue is very well written.The gameplay is very original, I can honestly say I've never played an RPG quite like this. Pretty much every aspect, from the battles to the stats and abilities are a means to drive the story forward. This is definitely not a game for everyone. However I would strongly suggest it to RPG fans and people looking for something new and unique. Overall 8/10.			"

												Winter Voices is an indie text heavy RPG a bit akin to Planescape: Torment, but also very different. Its strongest point is its fairly linear psychological and existential story centred on some of the darker aspects of us humans, but ultimately it's an experience of struggle, development, hope and growth; made with psychological insight. Next its ""combat"" encounters and its weakest the free roam hub-sections like the starting village. The game has a lovely artistic vision and ambience created by its hand-in-hand art direction, soundscape and writing. Which all have a wonderful poetic feel and are tied into the ""combat system"" beautifully. Plus if you are fond of metaphorical writing in works like ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" by Nietzsche, then you're bound to find the dream sequences interesting, as they employ metaphors to great effect. That said the English translation can be a bit iffy, so play it in its native French if you can.  The game is set in a fictional universe at the start of an industrial revolution in a Western country. The plot unfolds in a little remote, primitive and snowy mountain village, which lives by and practices a variant of Old Norse religion, whether the game is set in a Fantasy setting, or employs Magical Realism is up to interpretation, though it isn't at the core of the narrative outside of the dreams. You play a young and fragile twenty-four year old woman whose father has just died, it fairly quickly becomes apparent that you, the protagonist, have an abnormally hard time dealing with this death (wink wink), which propels you onwards on a journey of self-discovery within your dreams and the real world. RPG mechanicsThere are three classes to pick from Huntress, Weaver and Völva (a shamanic seeress). All of which favours one the six stats (Humour, Willpower, Memory, Perspicacity, Charisma and Intuition). These stats represents your strengths and weakness in your psychological profile. You get, primarily,  XP points to level them up from completing quest, ""combat"" and speaking with people. Separate from this you also gets Skill Points  as you level up. You can use them in a giant 2D-snowflake-formed Skill Tree with a total of 90ish skills to choose from enveloped by twelve different main paths (Negation, Metamorph , Pride, Social, Support, Composition, Ex-nihilo, Acceptance, Resilience, Resistance, Protection and Dispersion. ) to pursue, as you start out in the centre of it. You won't be able to learn all the skills in one play-through. Each of the twelve paths represents different ways, more or less gamey centred, human beings can deal, reflective or not, with grief and loss, whereas the ""sub skills"" are mixed between human traits such as creativity, perfectionism etc., and more culture specific things on the other hand such as: Song: Voluspa and Void Walker. ""Combat"" encounters. The combat encounters take place in the dreams of our protagonist. Troubled dreams that portrays her struggles to come to terms with her father's death and her past. They are turn-based puzzle-like encounters on a grid that represents her fight with her inner demons.  Overall I found the combat encounters interesting and varied enough in their different puzzles in my play-through as a Völva. Though an occasional freezing bug of the entire game was annoying in some of the longer key encounters, especially as you couldn't save in between them.In fact it made me put the game aside for around a year before returning to it once again. Though I am glad I did, as I really, really loved certain parts of the narrative :D			"

												This is a hard game to recommend. Truth be told, it has a fair share of drawbacks. Even with that in mind, this game possesses amazing naration, a deep, innovative combat/RPG system and a powerful story. It touches some very dark themes, and does so with finesse. The psychological allusions fused with the norse mythology work together to build an unforgetable and deeply affecting experience. My advice - play the demo, and if you are not turned off, go for it.			"

												What to say?  ""Your Mileage May Vary"" seems appropriate.I got this game in a bundle, they put the episodes beyond what was in the bundle on special.  I thought I should buy the episodes, but decided to try the prologue before investing any cash into the episodes.  I'm thankful I did.  The game and story seem very interesting. The world that the developers created IS great looking, and I do want to see more of it, but I've given up having any fun playing this game.The game kinda makes me feel like it's ME who's being tortured in ""playing"" the game rather then the main character.  Most of my complaints seem to echo others who would not recommend this game (and even some that do).  Moving around is too slow, the puzzles/combat seems to vary from easy to ""this is making me hate my life"", I also seem to think that perhaps the learning curve is at least a little bit steep,  I don't seem to understand effectively what attracts/detracts/masks you from the enemy memories (something I didn't realize was happening until I got tired of the game) or how that fits into the universe (how does one hide behind a rock from a bad memory?).   Another thing that also puts me way off with this game is the lack of ability to do any kind of actual fighting.  I'm all for the game not being violent, but I finally stopped playing when I felt hopeless that all I can do is push these ""memories"" around, and reduce their damage, while they slowly hunt me down, pushing me, reducing my movement, surrounding me, and finally killing me.  If I could lock some of the enemies down by trapping them somehow, or maybe push them so far they stop being a threat. I do wonder if some of those things are options that I just don't understand.I feel like I've given the developers a few hours of my life, and despite their valiant attempts, all they accomplished is having tortured me.Having said all that, it might just be something I'm missing, or just not my cup of tea.  The developers do seem to be competent, and able, to create something that could be intresting AND fun, they've just created something I hate.			"

												I'm sorry, but I can't do this again.It's an artsy little game that appears like it may have some interesting storytelling going on, but before you can really get into it you have to face the gameplay. The gameplay is this kind of turn-based... thing on a grid that just isn't very fun. Now, i've played good story games with unfun gameplay before, but the game has so much of this bad combat in the parts I managed to get through that I just lost interest. I didn't want to go through those annoying battles anymore.So i'd drop the game, then a few months later I would try it again... and quit because the combat system bored me to death. And on and on it repeated itself.And now, seeing this game in my library, still not even really touched after so many years... no. It's past time to get tossed into the bin. A game that has lost my interest multiple times when I am trying to get into it, no matter how good it might get later, is just not worth it for me.I might be missing out on a great story, but... I just can't do those damned battled again. Sorry.			"

												I will say this right away: do not get this game.Strong Points-Interesting story-Strategic combat-Plethora of skills allow for unique buildsWeak Points-Unbelievably slow pace-Game runs slowly and not on the latest version of Adobe Air-Riddled with bugs and glitches-Difficulty curve all over the place-Objectives are more often than not unclear-Large number of errors in dialogue and textThis game has been a disappointment. While it has a unique style and gameplay, it's unplayable. The pace of the game is horribly slow, it tries the patience. Your character walks slowly, it is extremely loaded in text and every action you take is slow. That aside, the game runs slowly too. It has trouble keeping up with each spell you cast, areas take a long time to load, etc. If the previous two points weren't enough, the frequent glitches in the game had me reloading constantly, making any sort of progress painstakingly difficult.The difficulty is also very problematic. While most encounters are very simple to get through and will allow for many different approaches and a variety of skill set, some are near impossible. I can count half a dozen encounters that I had to either retry 30 to 40 times, give up or win through sheer luck. I had to give up at a certain point in the epilogue after my 20th attempt at a 5-part encounter that you have to retry from the beginning every time you fail.Simply interacting with the environment is annoying. The only way you can interact with the environment is by walking to certain areas. This poses many problems: it takes ages to reach any point, the areas you need to walk to are not indicated, NPCs can get in the way (especially your companion), certain interactions block others, etc. The fixed camera means that half of the map at any given time is not visible, which means getting around and aiming at enemies is very difficult­. It's also often unclear on what tile an enemy is standing, it takes a lot of getting used to and even then, you still make a mistake every now and then.I could probably criticize this game further but I'm sure my point is clear by now. All in all, what could've been a great experience was ruined by the poor construction of the game. I got this game for a few dollars during a sale and regret purchasing it and spending as much time as I did on it. It is most definitely not worth the full price.			"

												I'm a bit of a masochist in that I'll try a game even if it's broken as long as it has a few redeeming points; Winter Voices does have a great story, but right off the bat I found it better to play in French since the dialogue was written in that language, and it just flows better that way. The English translation unfortunately suffers from many ""bugs"" (translations that don't flow well and don't always make sense). The voice narration also doesn't quite correspond to the written text (the voicing dialogue is better), which was enough to bug me by itself; I wish there was a way to hide the text completely in some instances.I'd seen on the developers' website that they planned/plan to provide a fully bugfixed version... I don't know if that's still happening given the state of their team, but I recommend waiting until that happens, or at least that you be prepared to save your game every 5 possible minutes in case the interface stops responding in any useful way (or you get stuck in a dialogue after the interface has already disappeared.) It feels as though devs skimped on having too many state checks to allow/disallow clicking, and the way I naturally interact with the interface just interrupts the game and forces me to reload too often. Beware, this also happens in places where narration immediately precedes a fight, removing any option to save. If the interface bugs out during those, you'll spend long minutes getting back to where you were if you die / try again. This is made worse in spots where 3, 4 battles are chained. There's no relief for me as this happened in every episode.Pathfinding also has issues where your teammates block the way out of a screen, and there's no way to control them or get them out of the way (you have to reload a previous save).Don't look for many keyboard shortcuts, this is a 97% mouse-driven experience, although it feels like the keyboard was forgotten rather than purposefully omitted.And finally, don't expect to have story options that lead you out of the main character's comfort zone, unlike many modern RPGs the point is not to cater to the player's tastes and provide many options, but really to tell a specific story.I have lots of spare time and am curious enough to play through the entire thing (on ep. 5 now), as I found the story captivating enough for that even despite the issues, but technical issues really are that frustrating throughout. I hope this gets fixed so I can update my review!			"

												You start as a 24 years old woman who lives in small village and looses her father. Everything is suffocating her in her hometown, so she decides to travel to a distant city where her father used to live.It has a unique graphic presentation, nice soundtrack and interesting theme however gameplay and some design choices are trying really hard to repel any person willing to give this game a chance.The protagonist struggles with a depression after her parent's death and this is quite visual as her fears take on physical form and throw you into the battle. Why would you need to fight a dragon while you have your inner horrors to fight? Battles are turn-based and usually require some planning.You also improve by leveling when you access skill tree in a form of snowflake and pick an ability which manifests how the character decides to deal with the reality (tough up - persistence +, cling to friends - heal allies, etc.). I like the whole idea quite well.On the other hand, the game fails to explain gameplay mechanism. Sometimes you find yourself surrounded by enemies, the text hints some a mechanism is being introduced and then you have to figure out what it is.It would be fine but combine it with slow pace (mostly thanks to slow movement of everything on screen) and the will to experiment leaves you.It brings me to another flaw in the game and that is general slowness. Controls are responsive but moving across mere 3 screens (1 screen = a short path next to a 1 bedroom house) can take up to a minute.There is also nothing to explore. You can either walk around, click on a person you wish to talk with or participate in a battle. No clickable objects which is not a flaw but I think it is good to mention.I played the prologue and a bit of episode 1 because I decided it is not worth it to keep going. I am not excited enough about the story to spend time mostly watching character crawling around.This game is certainly not for everybody, try demo to decide for yourself.			"

												Summary: Interesting universe created a refreshing explanation of RPG gameplay; narration/storyline tried a too hard to be deep; story ends up not saying much about the main character; slow-paced game; battles are more puzzle-like than turn-based real time strategy; not enough skill points at times (but can manually reset in .txt log); great atmosphere and music; great art except I don't like the portraits.------This review is for played Winter Voices: Avalanche, which is the prologue or ""Episode 0"" of the series. I bought it on sale for less than $5.I enjoyed the game's interesting story and its creative interpretation of RPG elements such as character classes, character stats, skills, and battle system. The universe of Winter Voices held my attention. Hintings toward magical or spiritual themes made me curious for a greater understanding of this world, but interest alone does not make a game. I see this game as appealing only to a small, niche audience. I wouldn't recommend it because it needs more polishing. Striving to complete the game felt aggravating, even torturous, at times. Here's what you need to know:1) Text-driven game with heavy reading. This game is not for those who cringe upon seeing walls of text.2) Battle system is more puzzle-strategy than tactical turn-based strategy. You don't actually kill enemies, but employ defensive strategies of spatial rearrangement or using decoys. Common goals per battle include surviving, protecting, or reaching a checkpoint. Different maps, enemies, and goals were enough to keep it fresh. Some puzzles were easy; others made me want to throw my laptop out the window. 3) Limited skill points. The snowflake-shaped skill tree is really cool (ba-dum tss), but you only gain one skill point per character level-up. I ended the game at level 7 with 6 skill points alotted. You're meant to develop the skill tree over the course of the series, but completing some challenging battles in the Prologue would have been impossible had I not manually reset my skill points repeatedly.4) Story is far too ""artsy."" It tried too hard to be deep. This is mostly due to the writing style, which is very flowery and comes off a bit pretentious. I'm all for complexity and poignant commentary on the hardships of life, but many metaphorical comments were lost on me because of the writing style. Sometimes I didn't know what was going on in the main character's real life. Most importantly, her father seemed cold an unaffectionate, so why would she care so much about him? I couldn't understand the premise of the whole plot. These factors undermined my motivation to complete the game.      4a) As for the main character's inner demons, the writing goes overboard trying to be mysterious and grotesque. Still, it's interesting to read and makes you wonder about the main character's mental state and a possible incorporation of some kind of spirit world. But it needs less surrealist sequences and more relevant discoveries to the main character's life, or it starts to lose relatability to the player. Enemy memories are never revealed as specific memories relevant to her life, so we still don't know any more about the relationship between the main character and her father by the end of the prologue. 5) Slow paced. The pacing of the game is slow in general, so you must have a lot of patience to play. This is largely due to emphasis on reading and point-and-click mechanism. Your character has a very slow walking animation. Because clicks don't redirect, one misclick means you have to watch your character saunter to that point before you can backtrack. Sometimes clicking on the edge of the screen to go to the next area of the map was unresponsive.6) Art is beautiful, yet the portraits of people are...kinda ugly. They are reminiscent of badly drawn anime. It's just not the style I was expecting from their concept art.7) Music. No complaints on the music; it greatly amplified the mystic and somber atmosphere.			"

												This is one of the more creative games I've played in the RPG field recently.  Although its story is opaque and difficult to discern at times, it's a quite meaningful mystery story.  The key attraction, however, is the combat... where you're forced to fight not physical monsters you can squish, but nightmares and dark memories you are incapable of harming.  It's a puzzle-strategy game where you must build your character around psychological defense mechanisms that will allow you to outwit the demons in your character's own mind.  (Denial isolates you from damage.  Sublimate fantasies that the nightmares have to tear down before they can reach you.  A slight bout of schizophrenia displaces the target of the nightmare's blame.) It's downfall is that it's a great idea on a terrible engine (Adobe AIR) that is scarcely capable of handling a game this complex.  It runs bizarrely slow when many units are on the field.Still, if you want a strategy RPG that involves actually using strategy instead of stats for a change, this game shows higher-budget titles how it's done.

												Pro:- Art, sound and atmosphere are great.- The ""combat""-system is quite original – weird, but enjoyable after you got into it.- The story is nice, but a bit overstretched for my taste.Con:- This game lacks balancing, bug fixing and suffers from clunky controls.- Somewhat slow movementWhen the negative aspects made me dump this game the first time, the awesome atmosphere made me come back. Then I resigned a second time due to some annoying bugs. Now half a year is gone, and I still wonder whether I should give it another try. That means something since normally I don't even give games a second chance. But the atmosphere ... it just hooked me.So I recommend this game for the experience, but be warned of all the frustration that's waiting for you.			"

												I know many consider this game to be artsy but I think it is not. The reason for my thinking is that this game seems to be a manifestation of the inner dreams of the person who made it. An artsy game for me is a game made for the sake of appearance or attention catching not for a personal motivation.. The SJW walking sims are an example of this.. But we can not and should not tag together this two types of games because otherwise we would simplify the artistic game panorama..For me this game is a dreamy escape from the heavyness of the real life, a fresh (icy) point of view of human nature.. I am not really good at making reviews but I am learning.. I do not think the ""combat"" system is hard or strange, I think is good for this type of game. I think one should strive to learn more things in life and this is a clear example.. There is a clear direction in this game and I want to immerse myself in it.			"

												A young woman suffers a trauma in the death of her father, she then battles her inner doubts and fears (spawning as enemies) using psychological tools and triggers as weapons (those are the skills you choose as you level up). Kind of innovative and poetic and I wish I could recommend it, but it is hard to do so because of all the bugs and crashes. Try the demo first and only get this on a sale and if you are very patient.			"

												A very well written story combine with an interest mix of puzzle and RPG in the combat--which depicts abstract struggles in the protagonists mind.  I love it.  There are some negatives in that the story (especially in the first episode after the prologue) isn't paced particularly well, and it takes so very long for the protagonist to walk across the screen.

												Winter Voices is focused on reading and text choices but it also has unique RPG system that acts as extension of story telling rather than generic combat. It has relatively complex stat and skill system but there are no items,equipment,looting or inventory . This is episodic adventure so I highly suggest trying demo or first episode (if this game is not for you you will know it right away). I would compare my experience with this game to reading book about RPG game instead of actually playing one. That may sound negative but it is wird to a point where I enjoy it . If you not a fan of text walls you already hate 80% of what this game is about . Combat without attacking enemies ?So you cannot directly attack enemies in this game . The hole ""combat system"" seems to be metaphorical representation for fighting your own emotions,memories and thoughts. In a nutshell RPG system here is all about staying alive as long as you can . To complete ""battles"" you commonly have to survive several turns or move to a location . However there are many other objectives that can be hidden in a clue ( for example you may need to kill yourself on purpose )Really ""RPG system"" here is more like a puzzle game . For the most part you trying to pick a safest route to complete your objective while using grid to your advantage . Many of your spells are designed for stealth , distraction or pushes .You can actually skip a lot of the battles if you can't complete them but you will be loosing Experience . There are some battles you can't skip that are tied to the story or boss fights .About 15 hours into game you do get a way of attacking enemies but it will be part for specific objectives and not your own skill . You have to get on a tile that gives you attacking skills for 5 turns as part of puzzle solving . Beginners Trap? You can absolutely loose the game by poor skill management . Well it would not be your fault because you don't know what kind of objectives you will come across . Skill system is very extensive so it is hard to say what is usefull and what is not . Picking wrong text choices may potentially loose you some experience but most of the characters give fixed ammount no matter whay you say to them . Skill System  Skill System like eveything else in game is mental extension of your character . It is actually very cool and creative design which is the best part about the hole thing (advance stat crunching) There are many passive effects , heals, summons ,active buffs,debuffs and stealth just to name a few  . I think I counted 12 different skill paths so there are many ways of playing the game .Another cool thing is that your Stats sometimes have impact on text choices . Humor can unlock new dialogue options for example . I got couple passive effects to increase humor and I seem to get more joke options while I talk . Artsyle and Music Love the music . For the most part it is ambient but it fits the game and adds to hunting atmosphere . You can customize your chacrater a little bit even though this game really did not need that feature . Even the Skill art is neat because it is all inspired by character's mind . It is not exactly a gorgeous game but it looks different in a good way . The only problem I have is lack of envirmonets (you will often see same types of backgrounds)  Story and Choices This game is very well written . Don't get me wrong I have no idea what is going on but someone really payed attention to detail when they were writing it . This game deals with psychological interpretation so you can find your own plot here . Few parts are voice acted and voice acted really well . I don't read books much (like never) so this game has a neat book reading experience .You can also meet new party members and build relationships that will unlock skills for them . I am at 40%+ In romance with a crow ( a bird damn it )It is hard to say on how much impact your choices actually have . I know for sure that it may effect the ammount of experience you get and effect what characters say . I think its possible to not get some of the party members by talking crap to them but I did not try it . Verdict 7/10 .There are a lot of problems with gameplay and glitches but unorthodox gameplay and good writing make it very different kind of expereince . I think many people will hate it because they expect traditional RPG game . No . In its core this is very expended text game with choices where ""battle system"" works more like a puzzle game that complements a text story. If you look at this game from a writing and story telling perspective it is a good game for what it is . Sure game has many problems (like no walking speed) but for a small company they really made something unique .			"

												Winter Voices is a peculiar game.  It has a standard tactial RPG setup, with a turn-based ""battle"" system, attribute points, and a skill tree.  You'll notice that I had to put quotation marks around battle.  To be blunt, you aren't usually battling things.  Most encounters involve running away from or avoiding enemies.  And crying, I can't forget to mention how much crying and sobbing there is.  It is peculiar mostly in this regard: you don't fight things, even though you are in a gaming framework where you'd expect to be able to fight things.Early on, probably even for the entirety of the first act, these battles are fairly unsatisfying.  For me, it wasn't until the second and third act that I started enjoying the game.  You start off with maybe three or four tools to use in battle, but slowly as you develop your skill tree you gain access to more and more possibilities.  This is where I think Winter Voices shines.  How you envision your character and which skills you use truly change your gameplay style.  Is your heroine the sort of person to run away from her problems?  Is she more likely to just ignore them?  Does she invent stories to help her forget? Does she rely on friends instead?  I feel like these choices make a bigger impact than ""Do I want a giant flame hammer or a shiny ice dagger?"" type of choices you might find in other tactical RPGs.The game has many flaws:  the plot is murky at best, the writing is over the top (I wish I could think up enough ridiculously highfalutin words off the top of my head to convey this, but I cannot),  and the battles can be infuriatingly boring.  I still give it a positive review because, in the end, I enjoyed it.  There's a demo to see if you might like it too.			"

												Winter Voices is an ambitious game that has some unique and interesting ideas but its utterly mired by terrible game design and pretty pretentious writing for the most part. When it comes to the good, the game used to be buggy as hell from what I hear, but it’s fairly stable now. The idea that you run away from enemies is a neat one, but it’s way too easy to utterly gimp yourself build-wise and the later game encounters are horribly designed to point that it can make the game unwinnable, even if you’ve been using a really good build up till that point. The atmosphere is really good and the soundtrack complements it well; there's a real bleak and lonely tone that permeates the game. It also has an interesting world inspired by Norse mythology that maintains ambiguity whether or not there is anything supernatural going on. The writing when it comes to characters is alright too, it’s just the narration and the dream world that are bad. Though it also really does fall into some bad clichés (Let’s have our female protagonist get almost r*ped twice guys!) . Overall there is some quality stuff here that I liked that kept me playing until towards the end of  Episode 4 but the negatives eventually dragged the game down. They really should have just made it an adventure game.			"

												This game is for those people who really have alot of patience and time. Overall, I enjoyed the game, but it takes alot of time to play, as it is relatively 'sluggish'. That being said, I didn't really have the attention span needed to stay focused. But combat is unique and does need a *bit* of strategy. As for the story, I didn't really play long enough to get a good enough grip on the story (I don't think I ever made it out of town), but if it's anything like what I think it is, it'll be great. I took it as a girl having to face her fears and try to overcome the pain of memories and such. If that IS indeed what the story is, then I think this game has a lot of potential. But, as said, it's very slow. If you've got a lot of time to kill, have a good amount of patience, and are looking for a game that isn't just about violence and racking up the most head-shots, then I would definitely reccomend this game.

												Winter Voices... Well, if you like tactical challenges then this may be a good game for you. If you like feeling capable, powerful and successful then this game will disappoint you at every turn. While the later episodes do start to give you that feeling, occasionally, it's such a slow slog up to that point that it's honestly not worth the money. The ""combat"" is really more like a series of puzzles framed as dealing with opponents which, in theory, can be quite fun and interesting. The pace ruins it, making each combat an exercise in trial-and-error and hoping that the AI doesn't just decide to finish you off.The story is rather fascinating and an interesting take on the heroine's journey, or growing up, and one could argue the game's design is meant to give the player the feel of the despair and depression the character is feeling. That said, there are very few gamers who will actually get this feeling and enjoy the experience.			"

												Though game has bad reviews, it's actually good. What's good about it is that it's completely unique - instead of killing enemies main heroine progresses through the game protecting herself from her own bad memories and phychological traumas. Game has a huge number of skills to select from on the skill snowflake (tree) and quite interesting though somewhat confusing story. Game progresses somewhat slow, but it's not meant to rush through anyway. Those who have patience and like unique and original indie games should definately try this one.			"

If you like grid, turn based battle systems, this has you covered. Mystery, yeah its got that too. Do you like to read? It has lots of text for good reason though. Have you ever wondered what fighting with your inner thoughts and feelings would look like? This does it in a way like no other could. Play the demo, if you like what you see, buy the first episode.

												I am really conflicted about this game. It's simultaneously compelling and truly awful, and what really hurts is that perhaps the worst element of the game is the writing, something I value more than any other element in an RPG. It's a French game, so it's possible there was a problem in translation, but that can't possibly account for the cringe-worthy style.That being said, the art is interesting, the music is great (mostly, there's some lyrics in the end of Ep. 0 that were awful, but the rest is all instrumental), the story is keeping me playing (despite the details being driven by horrible writing), and the concept is great. I'm not usually drawn in by something as abstract as the ""concept"" of a game, but how the personal nature of the conflict is woven into the stats/skills progression is actually genuinely enjoyable. ""Levelling up"" is infused with meaning that other games don't have.This game is not for everyone, but I will buy the remaining episodes.			"

												This is not your typical RPG.  What it lacks in loot and action it more than makes up for in atmosphere and immersive narrative.  Combined with a pleasing artistic style and music, this is a great game.  Unfortunately, it does have it's downfalls but they are all technical.  For starters, it's built on Adobe AIR.  That should be enough to make you think twice about purchasing.  Once inside the game, you'll likely encounter abrupt stops to pathfinding, map changes not triggering, walking through doors and some combat bugs that force you to reload the game.  So far these have been nothing more than an inconvenience to me though.In summary, it's almost like this game was conceived and scripted by the best poets and artists of the ages but programmed by a monkey on a typewriter (or maybe poets and artists).  Bottom line: If you like story and can deal with technical annoyances, you will absolutely enjoy this game.			"

												The idea of this game is a great one. The artwork is amazing as well. The strategy involved in the battles is alright until you find an unwinnable scenario (yay, traumas blocking the path with a wall behind them so you can't push them or draw them out, and no, you can't attack them either).But the story was written by someone who threw as many words in as possible to make it seem like they are poetic - they're not. It could have been a great story, if they had spent their words more wisely. I love reading, I love poetry, I hate the story in this game. The whole time I was playing I was distracted by wondering what kind of person wrote the story, rather than enjoying the game. They butchered the English language while probably thinking they were saying something amazing, deep and insightful.In a game like Winter Voices, the story is everything.

												Generally speaking, I feel like this game misses the mark. The writing is deeply irritating and pretentious nonsense, which is fine. I'd be happy to suffer through a little irritation if the ""game"" parts of Winter Voices weren't just as deeply irritating. Simply put, the ""combat"" is terrible.Firstly, it would be inaccurate to call this combat. It technically is a tactical RPG combat system, but what you're doing isn't fighting so much as avoiding damage for an arbitrary number of turns (one of the popular ""win"" conditions is Last 10 Turns) or reaching a certain tile on the tactical grid. When I read about it, it impressed me as a novel way of representing the game's protagonist dealing with nightmares and emotions and such, and it is, but the implementation is clunky and amateurish in the extreme.The art's very attractive, the setting is intriguing, the UI is effective (as you can tell from the screenshots) and while I personally find the faux-Proustian pretentiousness of the writing insufferable, it's entirely possible that it gets less so in the later episodes, but the combat system drags it all down into the mud of disappointment and unplayability. I feel like this would've worked better as a more traditional story-driven adventure or even visual novel-type experience than trying to cram it into tactical RPG shoes.			"

												Okay, so this is my second edit. The developer of this game and I have talked in depth. During that time, with regard to the r.ape apologizing his game has done, he not only doubled down on it, expressing the belief that as unfortunate as it is, women can do certain things to help prevent them from being r.aped, (though he maintains that the r.ape apologists in the game are that way because of the time period and their own flaws,) but also stated that he understands this r.apist he wrote into the game and excuses away his act by saying he is a simple man and desired the protagonist heavily! I discourage anyone from buying or playing this game. You can read the progression of my comments below with some spoilers. Okay, I don't think I can really overstate this, but this game needs a big ""trigger warning!"" sign attached to it. I was really enjoying the game until episode 4. I knew full well that there had to be ♥♥♥♥ involved somewhere, but I didn't expect the mental scarring that episode 4 has presented me with in all its craziness.See the bottom for why I changed my mind on recommending this game. Also, the blocked word is r.a.p.e I'm not using it incorrectly or in obscene sense, the game focuses around it, so hopefully I won't get in trouble.Some of this might destroy the plot for you (kind of) so if you want to buy this game, skip this paragraph. The short is, there is a freakish amount of attempted ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥. ---- This game's plot is mostly done through written text. It's very metaphorical and verbose, and really has some great writing. Sooo, episode 4, you are on a ship. First off, you get a guy that hits on you even when you make it clear you are not interested in him, then you get a drunk who makes sexual advances at you early on. No I'm not complaining about either of those. In the span of a few fights and the events in between, (fights are usually just expressions of dreams or emotional anguish, all these fights are while you sleep, you get story info from them and other story stuff happens when you are awake,) my character had these two characters attempt to ♥♥♥♥ her in a rather graphic sequence of events with your character just eerily standing next to them on screen and the description in text. But if that doesn't screw with your head, your character is slowly realizing she was ♥♥♥♥♥ at an earlier time, (before the game starts,) and suppressed the memory. And while the details are, as I said, very metaphorical, they are also extremely graphic. Seriously, I'm at the end fight of ep 4 and I have been emotionally torn down all day and don't really want to play the game, though only in a small part because I am stuck on this episode's final fight and may need to replay the episode entirely. And to screw with you further, you have a couple of ♥♥♥♥ apologists, including an old man you divulge your secrets to (whether you want to or not.) He actually says you ""provoke men."" Another guy says you are kind of asking for it, but he is clearly meant to be a jerk, and you can insult him at length even before that.So on to the problems with gameplay. There aren't a lot of them, but you can't respec skills or stats. One of your stats is memory, which decides how hard the game is for you. If you muck this up, you won't know until a big mandatory fight. I have a very low 45 memory, and I am getting trashed in this ep 4 fight. It is mandatory, and I've defeated all the level 4 fights before this but one ridiculously hard one. Nothing has been even remotely this hard before, so I would periodically raise memory to increase the challenge. With another character, I have the max possible memory, and can not get past the prologue.That said, I don't know whether to recommend this game or not, due to my complaints, but also because the writing is so awesome and the concept is so refreshing (except the ♥♥♥♥, seriously, do game developers have no other ways to bring depth to female characters besides victimizing them?) So I am going to not recommend this game, just because this entire post has been complaints anyway.Edit: Okay, I've thought about this. I still am not comfortable at all with the r.a.p,e apologist (seriously? blocking the word ♥♥♥♥? how the heck am I supposed to explain the issues I have with a game centering around that?! Hopefully spelling it out once so everyone knows what I'm actually talking about will help.) I do like that game, though I think a strong message needs to be sent to the designers about including that kind of thing.Honestly, I'd like to see a sequel though, and they haven't made the kind of money for that. This is a pretty good RPG/puzzle game, and the thinking required for some of the harder fights is pretty heavy. Especially with how many different skills there are. I cheated for the last fight of episode 4, and may cheat for the chessboard fight for episode 6. There are guides to cheating, but trying to screw with your level works poorly, though you can respec your stats that way if you don't like them (lowering your memory can drop your level though.) I just gave myself a bunch of pending skill points and bought tons of skills so I had a better selection of what I could pull out of my hat while fighting.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I really did. But there's nothing here to like. The story is pretentious, nonsensical, and not interesting in the least. The ""combat"" is boring and slow. And the RPG leveling system is completely broken, with certain powers being effectively required to progress in the game, but of course the game doesn't tell you that. Oh yeah, and it's glitchy. One stage in particular repeatedly put me in a position where it was impossible for me to win, and impossible for me to kill myself so I could try again, forcing me to reload my save. That's the point at which I stopped playing. And of course, now that the developer disbanded, it's looking like the story will never be finished. Stay far, far away from this one.			"

												An interesting story, but only if you love the mystical. As for the gameplay, the defensive combat system looked interesting. However, the lack of information about the enemies capabilities and the absence of significant sounds makes it frustrating and finally boring. Also, the animations are slow and there are no objects to interact with. The graphics are decent but could be a lot better. Where are the winter sounds, the cracking of the snow, the winter nights, the winter wind? the howling of the wolves? Only this dull music instead...			"

												Stay away from this crap. Seriously. You will think it's good because it's cheap and it's pretty and because fighting inner demons with the power of imaginary friends and a mahusive ego sounds like a good idea. It's not.Problem 1: Text. Walls and walls of pointless text. NPCs will tell you about your own character in a way that clashes horrendously with the character you have been creating. The narrator will describe beautiful landscapes to you for 5 - 10 minutes at a time, while you're looking at a beautiful, handpainted picture of said landscape. Some battles require you to follow instructions that are unclear, incomplete (but incredibly purple!) and not logged anywhere.Problem 2: Animation. Too long. No sprint option. Poorly designed map. Repetitive locations. Overly long fade-ins and fade-outs. JUST LET ME PLAY ALREADY.Problem 3: Sound. While the music fits this game perfectly, the narrator was driving me insane. His performance, like everything else in the game, was far to slow. And having a male narrator read out poorly written text that can't decide whether it's talking TO and AS the female protagonist was just plain confusing. And there no sound effects. Not for walking, not for different environments, not even for the HUD. Which brings me to...Problem 4: Bugs. The game will freeze regularly. Often during round 50 of a battle during which the save feature is disabled. Sometimes just before or after screen transistions or cutscenes. And in a game this slow, you can never tell when the game actually froze and when it's just being leg-chewingly slow.Problem 5: The writing. Oh my god, the writing. The writers seem to operate on Tell, Don't Show, Then Tell Again. And Again For Emphasis. And Again Because Otherwise The Game Would Be Over In Half The Time. There is zero character consistence. Dialogue options are extremely restrictive. When you get a rare moment of narrative freedom the game pretends you followed whatever option the writers liked best. The 'humorous' dialogue options come across as psychotic. Every single female NPC can be insulted - allegedly they talk too much. The 'shut up' option for male NPCs that were too creepy was missing entirely. The writers are so full of themselves that they give you this disapproving 'Are you sure you want to skip the intro?' message every single time you start up the game.Problem 6: Winter Voices: What Do The Devs Want Me To Do? This applies to every single aspect of the game. Trying to navigate from one area of your village to an adjacent one? Too bad, you need to go via the marketplace. Trying to navigate from one area of a different village with the same layout to an adjacent one? Yep, no problem, just head over there. Don't feel like solving riddles? Have fun with those unskippable battles that require ridiculously specific solutions. Looking forward to fleshing out your character via dialogue options? Any choice other than 'sniffling shy mentally 4 year old' is ignored or patronised by the game.Problem 7 (SPOILER Ep 3): The sexual assault scene on the boat. Out of character for everyone and the godawful writing made me hate my companion ('I will beat up this person you've enjoyed flirting with for the past few days, but will stare blankly into nothingness after the resident drunk assaulted you twice.'). Of course the game was written by French males, so it has to have at least one sexual assault on a woman.Problem 8: I think the crow wants to romance me.			"

												""Recommend"" is the wrong word here, but I'm not sure where else to put a ""warning"". This game seems pretty artsy, which I normally like, but the dialogue sounds like it was written by a depressed kid in high school, and the movement is so unnecessarily slow and grid based outside of combat that you spend more time watching your character saunter across the screen than anything else. Combat is clumsy, unintuitive, and consists of turn-based battles of attrition in which you cannot attack and must simply wait out, healing and defending, or simply flee from the odd, formless blobs of enemies based on your psyche. None of the skills and attributes do anything noticable, and dialogue seems pointless since nothing you say makes a difference. The game gives you an avatar that looks nothing like your portrait, and is just as faceless as every other same-colored NPC in this white world. They say the Eskimo language has a hundred words for ""snow"". This game has showed me that English does, too.			"

												This game is an extremely pretentious and refreshing twist on the tactical RPG genre.  The graphics are all rendered in a painterly style, and most of the dialogue is cryptic freeform poetry.  Oh, and you can't actually attack your enemies during combat (with few exceptions).  Gameplay is largely defensive.  The object is typically to get from one side of an area to the other, or simply to survive for so many turns.  It's undoubtedly not for everyone, but I'm enjoying it.I had been holding off on playing this and giving it the thumbs up because it was buggy as all hell on release, but hey, it's patched now!  As in, it's actually playable, and the dev is working on ironing out the remaining kinks.			"

												Buggier than a Southern summer. I, in my short time trying to play this game, had my character's sprite randomly shift to an adjacent tile dozens of times (when this happens, you need to exit the game to fix it), instantly won a battle by randomly spawning at the end of a minefield instead of at the beginning, and crashed to desktop countless times. These and other bugs happened on a nearly minute-by-minute basis. This is the level of quality you'd expect from a PRE-alpha build.Even if you can get past the constant storm of bugs, there isn't much here. All missions are either ""Get to this location,"" or ""Survive for n turns.""TL;DR, save your money.			"

												Winter Voices is as a game... not very good. While being slow paced isn't exactly a bad thing, Winter Voices can grind to snail pace and is not helped by the painful movement speed and horrid detection of screen transitions. Some combat segments can be dull and while most of them are skip-able, some painful ones are not. There are some bugs, one of the worst being when you intend to talk to someone only to step on the square that activates a screen transition suddenly you find yourself looking a black screen. So yes as a game, it is pretty bad... but it's also one of the most satisfying purchases I've made.After the introduction of narrated soothing muse and eerily somber music you create and name your female protagonist (side note: if this game's story had either been told from the perspective of a man or had been designed with the intent for both parties being possible protagonists, it would probably have been a lesser game. ), you get placed into a story of loss, self discovery, pain, and growth... if that sounds vague, it's because spoiling it would hurt the experience . but to give the jist, your dad died and you are starting to feel out of place in the village so you decide to leave.the games combat is narrative driven and even the rpg element of learning abilities is structured more like a metaphor for dealing with loss, or your problems in general. It can do this since you are actually fighting the mental hallucinations of you own tormented soul, which sounds awesome; but, it would be a hell of a lot more engaging if it wasn't such a dull and monotonous task. Where this game fails to be a game it works wonders as an interactive story. The writing is beautiful; it matches the sad and sometimes Gothic tone of the story perfectly and is presented in an almost poetic manner. Coby Batty does a great job with as the voice of the father and narrator. In all honesty, if I could give one indie title a Triple A budget, this is the game I would love to see perfected. So I do whole heartedly recommend grabbing this game and pressing through it's dodgy design choices because it is that good of an interactive story. Here is waiting for Season 2.			"

												The only thing I would change is giving it a speed option.  Little slow for my taste.  Good story, I love the narrators voice.  I chose to play a Volva my first time around, despite reading that it was more challenging, I have no regrets.  It's an interesting class for sure :).			"
