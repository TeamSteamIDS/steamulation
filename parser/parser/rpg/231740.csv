												Knights of Pen & Paper, originally for iOS, is a turn-based RPG with a novel concept: you take on the role of real-life players in a tabletop game.  The camera is set behind a table where up to five of your characters are seated, with the dungeon master on the other side leading you through the story.  Dialogue tends to be humorous and frequently goes out of character.The game begins with character creation, where you must assign your players a real-life persona and one of a dozen traditional RPG classes, each with four skills.  The actual gameplay takes place around your table, as if you’re in the middle of all the action, and consists of traveling to locations on a world map and completing quests, which are really just more battles in disguise.  In fact, the entire game is simply one battle after another and becomes very repetitive, very fast.As expected, level-ups provide stat bonuses and allow you to upgrade your skills and wear better equipment.  Armor and weapons may only be improved at the blacksmith, but each character has four additional slots for equipping various accessories.  In addition to in-game shops, there is a “real-life” shop where you may purchase snacks that provide temporary buffs for your players, as well as decorations and furniture that confer permanent bonuses.Overall, Knights of Pen & Paper is passable in the context of mobile gaming but completely forgettable when compared to quality games on the PC platform.  Considering the price is $9.99 on Steam vs a mere $2.99 on iOS and Android, it’s borderline offensive that the devs left in-app purchases in the game, allowing you to buy gold with your Steam wallet funds.  Such a shameless exhibit of its mobile origins is a fitting red flag for a game that also fails to break away from the shallow, repetitive gameplay those origins typically entail.			"

												I admit, I miss tabletop gaming. I miss the DM trying to kill off my characters. I miss creating ridiculously out-of-the-box characters. Heck, I miss the days of popcorn, Mountain Dew, and just hanging out and rolling some dice. Those days have been gone for me quite some time, and yet playing a little game called Knights of Pen and Paper reminded me of those good old days.Knights of Pen and Paper attempts to mimic tabletop gaming for an accessible audience. Players start by selecting three noobs to join the adventuring party, along with their class and starting skill. Like any tabletop RPG, as the adventuring party explores, kills baddies, and completes quests, they earn experience to level up and gain more skills. Each party member gets one skill point every time they level up and can only put points into one of four skills. While this creates simplicity for those unfamiliar with RPGs, it doesn't provide a lot of variety.In fact, variety is what Knights of Pen and Paper struggles with throughout its twenty hour campaign. Although the backgrounds mimic an 8-bit style, there isn't much in terms of detail or design. The soundtrack loops, but it feels like there's only three tracks in the entire game. Although there's plenty of classes in the game, many of them are locked and the requirements for unlocking them appear random. The base classes — paladin, mage, cleric, etc. — while classic, are trapped with only four skills, which wouldn't be the case in tabletop gaming.While variety isn't the game's strong suit, accessibility is. It provides a simple turn-based battle system wherein players can select between attack, skill, defend, item, and flee. This makes for an easy learning experience, but it lacks any real depth that a tabletop game has. The game is also surprisingly grindy, and while it does a great job of teaching players what to expect in encounters (usually enemies three to five levels higher than the adventuring party), it's a bit crazy how much players will have to stop and grind because it's not entirely on par with the party's level. It feels like the developers set out to make a simple RPG to give players the feel of tabletop gaming, but the combat could have benefited from actual dice rolls on screen to indicate whether or not the player's characters succeeded or fail in their actions. However, with the grindy combat, perhaps adding dice rolls would have just made everything take longer than provide more accessibility. Still, the combat lacks depth and it needs something else to make it a more engaging process.Dice rolling does exist within Knights of Pen and Paper, it's just not as frequent as it should be. Dice rolls occur when players travel between areas, failures leading to battles, successes leading to safety. Dice rolls occur when players are mining for grindstones or moving through dungeons. These elements are done well and are fairly straightforward, but this game would really benefit if it was implemented into all actions, especially if its goal is to mimic tabletop games. What's further disappointing is the campaign itself. While the writing is charming and hilarious, the majority of the quests are either escort missions, collecting items, slaying some bad dudes, or traveling from place to place for plot purposes. The amount of backtracking in this game is brutal and inexcusable, and even the adventuring party complains about it. It goes back to that problem of accessibility versus variety — on one hand, the campaign should be easy to learn and follow along, on the other hand there should be more to do than then the standard affair. The charm in the writing, and even its awkward translation errors, can only go so far and will likely leave veteran RPG gamers wanting something more substantial.However, Knights of Pen and Paper does succeed in its overall atmosphere. Players get the sense of gamers hanging out, bantering, and asking to pass the Mountain Dew. There is an overall sense that the Dungeon Master is out to kill the adventuring party, and the back and forth within the writing really does work well. The graphics and music, though overly simplistic, are vibrant and give the feeling that players are on an adventure and there is loot to be had. The game is also a fantastic time waster because in its lack of depth it success at being the type of mindless game where players find themselves going, ""just one more quest."" Considering all of the game's flaws, it admittedly succeeds in the one area that for some people matters most: it's actually fun.There are some perks in Knights of Pen and Paper's PC release that differ from the original mobile version. For starters, it allows players to leave party members at the tavern, and bring a new adventurers into the party. They can roll for a new character and not feel like they have to start their entire campaign from scratch. There's also an extended campaign for those who want to explore more of what the game has to offer, and there's tons of new dungeons and loot to acquire. The main campaign can be completed in around twenty hours, with the extended campaign offering quite a bit of replay value. There's also tons of items that can be purchased in shops that can give added bonuses to various stats, which is a nice cosmetic feature.Knights of Pen and Paper is a sweet little throwback to the days of pen and paper gaming, but its simple approach may not be enough to entice every RPG gamer. Yes, the combat is simplistic, but it's fast and easy to roll with. Sure, the story is simple, but it's cute in its presentation. Knights of Pen and Paper's imperfections are many, and yet it's completely easy to sink time into. It's straightforward in its approach and yet, despite its flaws and frustration, I kept playing. Knights of Pen and Paper will never offer gamers a deep experience, but it offers mindless gameplay that admittedly can keep you coming back for more.Recommended "

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a fantasy RPG, which plays like tabletop RPGs. The twist is that you're playing as both the dungeon master and the players. Basically that means you can decide yourself what kind of quests you want (to some extent) and how difficult you want to make the fights by choosing how many enemies you want to fight against. And because the game is like tabletop RPGs, there are several situations where you'll throw a virtual D20 dice.When you first start the game you get to choose from about 10 characters to be the players and 5 classes for them. Each character has a different passive bonus that increases some attributes, which actually leads to choosing the characters based on the bonuses and the class you're going to pick. When starting a new game you get to choose 2 players for free and the remaining 3 seats in the table you can fill by buying the players with in-game gold. You can swap the players in places that have a tavern.If I remember correctly, you first have 5 classes available, but you can unlock a few more by completing side-quests. You can only have one of each class, so for example you can't have 5 warriors as your party. You wouldn't want to either. The reason being that each class has its purpose. Some classes are healers, some are tanks and the rest are either melee fighters or spellcasters of some description. Each class has 4 skills, which are either passive or spells and skills that you can use during combat. The passive skills usually boost some attribute, but some of them also have special stat boosts like life steal. The active skills are pretty basic fantasy RPG skills. You can increase one of the skills every time you level up, which just made the skills more powerful or increased the attribute bonus. So it isn't very deep skill system.The combat is turn based and the players and the enemies all have a box either on top of or below the sprite, which shows the number of their turn. On the player's turns you choose to either attack, use a skill/spell, use an item, defend or run away from the battle. You quite rarely want to use anything other than a skill or spell, because those are the most effective way for beating the enemies. As I mentioned earlier, you get to choose how many and what kind of enemies you want to fight against. Once you buy a certain item from a special shop you can fight 7 enemies at a time, but before that the maximum was 5, I think. I bought that item very early on and didn't check the maximum amount before that. The enemies you can choose from vary quite a lot and you can often choose to fight tougher elite monsters, which give better rewards.I thought the combat was quite fun, but it got kinda boring after 8 hours because in the end it was just the same thing over and over again. At least they kept things fresh with different enemies. The difficulty ramped up quite a lot after about halfway into the game, when the enemies suddenly became very high-leveled compared to the players. Surprisingly enough, I could survive against much higher level enemies than my players were provided I only fought against 3 at a time. It could take a long time to kill them all, but I still could do it. I suppose I played it quite safe since most of the time I fought battles I knew I could win and as a result my whole party died only 3 times during the time I played the game.When you're not in combat you can choose from several options depending on your location in the world. In almost every place you can choose to rest, start a quest specific to the location, use items, check the equipment of the players or travel to some other place. Cities usually also have shops for buying potions and equipment, a tavern and a blacksmith. The blacksmith can upgrade your equipment, but you shouldn't do that until you have increased the blacksmith's level enough for the odds to be on your side. The upgrading is chance based and it happens by throwing the dice. The range of ""winning"" numbers increases as the blacksmith levels up, which makes it easier to win. It's also a good idea to have level 16 players, because then you can equip items that decrease the equipment upgrading cost. I wasted several hundreds of in-game gold before I found about those items.Moving in the world happens by opening the world map and then choosing the location. Traveling costs some gold and every time you move on the map, you throw the D20 dice and depending the roll you might get a random battle. That would get annoying very quickly, if you had to fight some low level monsters when moving around the starting area with high level players, but luckily the chance for the random battle depends on the players' levels and the levels of the monsters in the area you're travelling to. You can also a buy an item that permanently increases your dice rolls by 1, which makes it impossible to get random battles in low level areas. I thought the time it took to travel between each place was a bit too long, but you could reduce that to half if you had a certain game master active.Quests were quite repetitive and not very fun. There is basically 3 types of quest: kill x amount of certain monsters, escort/deliver something and ""fetch"" some items by going to a certain place and killing the enemies there for the items and then return to the place where you started the quest. On the upside the quests gave a lot of experience. There were also some story quests as this game has a (boring) story about saving the pen and paper world. I think the dialog should have been funny, but I didn't find it funny. There were quite many references, but those weren't funny either. At one point I stopped caring about the story entirely and just skipped through the dialog. I just didn't find it interesting at all.The game also has a special store that you can access anytime you're not in combat or in the middle of some conversation. The store has items like furniture, which boost something permanently, and snacks, which give a boost that only lasts for about 15 minutes. You can switch between the furniture you have bought without having to buy them again. I usually switched them based on the situation I was in. Everything bought in this store transferred to other saves too, so you only had to buy the stuff once.I believe the game was originally designed for phones and tablets as there is an in-game store, from which you can buy in-game gold for real money. However, using the in-game store is never required and it can be completely ignored. Once you reach a certain point in the game, you can easily get around 300 gold from a fight that lasts for a minute. The in-game gold is transferred between saves so you can have a save for farming gold for the other save. The real money store in the game seems to be a thing that makes some people skip the game entirely, even though you never have to use the store.The graphics are 2D pixel art and the sounds effects are pretty old-school bleeps and bloops. There is no voice acting, so you have to read through all the dialog. I thought the music was repetitive so I ended up muting it.Overall I thought it was pretty enjoyable game and I was quite addicted to it for a while. I played it for 21 hours in total, which included me first going through half the game and then starting a new save to get couple of achievements. I finished the story in the second game I started and also beat the optional boss. I also got every achievement aside from the 3 broken ones. The boring story and the in-game real money store are definite cons, but the rest of the game is fun even without very deep character development or combat.			"

												There isn't much to this game; it's just a simple, humorous 8-bit turn base game. There is a lot of hilarious commentary and for the most part character development is nice. I know that the dialog is all pre-set, but it makes the characters pretty funny and sassy. One of my favorite aspects is the ridiculous dirty jokes made through-out the game.There's a ton (I mean A LOT) of characters and classes to choose from. There's a nice little upgrade setting that lets you have a few different moves and upgrade them. It's just like any other turn base game. It's fun, it's cheap and the developers are extremely nice and enjoy interacting with their fans; which is always great. I would definably get this game while on sale.			"

												This is a very simple looking RPG on the cover but once you get into it, there is plenty of min/maxing to be done. A turn based gameplay makes fits this much more than a normal action type. I love how you can swap in ""team members"" to the table once you purchase more seats at the table.Another thing which is probably overlooked in Knights of Pen & Paper, is the dialog of the dungeon master and the players, some really humours lines came out during my playthrough and I would really recommend anyone read through them for a giggle. The soundtracks can get fairly repetitve but what do you expect for an 8bit style game. I'm up to about twelve hours gameplay and I am still finding new things to try out. I would 100% recommend this to any RPG/Turn based fan			"

												I don't know where and when I got this game...But... This game...This game is awesome!I liked the overall parody feel about it while it has a strong and solid work about delivering action and plot in moderation, getting some loud laughs from me here and there. The battle is unforgiving, so you always have to be focused, despite it being turn-based. The difficulty is adjustable in a manner ""How frisky you are today?"", taking on anything between 1 and 7 rats or elite monsters. The open-ended way the characters are presented lets you use your imagination. I do feel like playing a table top sheets'n'pens while playing this. Yes, the feel of every character is an illusion, but it's a very-VERY well made illusion.Another point is the building difficulty: Items give you stats that you barely see. Levels give you damage that you barely see. Hp and Mana regen is earned by tears and sweat dripping down your inner thigh. All this while enemy shamelessly uses lifesteal and applies crazy bleeding stacks. Some battles will be so tight that you will stain your undergarments a bit and still lose because of the enemy randomly preferring your rouge to your fully buffed granny paladin. You will put a sleep on a DoT'ed enemy and lose your healer because of that, and you will spend 4 times the money you earned in that battle to revive your team. You will even spend 2k on upgrading your sword and still get nothing in return because you are a looser and you will have no money to leave the god forsaken town.But... You know... That's what's good about this game... That's what's your adventure is. And you should not just accept it, but have tons of fun while at it!I would like to say thank you to the developers. I've seen a lot of attempts to do what they achieved in this game and i think they did it better than anyone else I've seen so far, including UnEpic and Magicka, the first being too far away and the second being a bit too silly. But this game, oh, this game grabs the bull by his modesty and makes him enjoy it so much that he's ashamed afterwards, but he begs for more.Highly recommend.			"

												This has the appearance of a nostalgic D&D tabletop setting, but is more like a poorly-translated turn-based JRPG, where tactical positioning and well-timed skill choices are not the focus. Instead, players find themselves killing hordes upon hordes of monsters to make numbers go up so they can kill bigger hordes of scarier monsters. The story tries to be humorous about a D&D group finding the line between fantasy and reality blurred with numerous shoe-horned cameos, but the writing itself is unnatural to the point that it feels like a high-schooler's fan-fiction. In fact, if you're looking for a game the emulates the D&D experience, I recommend Cardhunter, a free-to-play tactical game with better writing and more involved gameplay.Even if you're in the market for a mindless grind-a-thon, don't buy this on the PC. Opt for the mobile version instead, since the game also constantly puts you through miniscule but unskippable animations that would be more bearable if you could look out the window while they play. Hell, I'd recommend other mobile games entirely, but some people like their skinner boxes and this is one of the skinneriest boxes I've ever seen.P.S.: This game *had* micro-transactions, but those have been removed. According to an anonymous source (see comment), the microtransaction was originally forced on by a publisher. A sad case of publisher overruling developer control. The game is still a terrible grind though.			"

												The first 4-5 hours are great, when you are exploring the world, unlocking new classes and testing different groups. Sadly, afterwards the game becomes a massive grind of fighting the same enemies over and over, going back and forth the same places and every battle feels exactly the same...It has a lot of flavor and cool references, but still I couldn't even force myself to reach the end of the game. There's micro-transactions in-game, but honestly they don't get in the way, the massive grind at end-game and lack of interesting battles are this game's major flaws. "

The Good: Fun premise, mixing the tropes of D&D-style tabletop gaming and Final Fantasy-esque RPG combat, with the usual nods to post-Tolkien high fantasy worlds. There's a solid dose of fun pop culture references (from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Super Mario Brothers in the sewer dungeon, to Pirates of the Caribbean and the Creature from the Black Lagoon in the seaside areas). And it's not just gratuitious name-checking either -- all of it is properly statted out and integrated into the gameplay.The Bad: Admittedly, it's hardly ground-breaking stuff, especially if you're partial to comedy/parody RPGs. It's not quite as witty or clever as its web-based counterparts like Kingdom of Loathing[kingdomofloathing.com] or Card Hunter[game.cardhunter.com]. But even as someone who liked both those games, I wasn't disappointed -- I'm now at 10 hours play time and counting.The Ugly: Less-than-ideal game balance. It definitely appears to favor particular player/class combos over others, to the point that it's damn near impossible to last the higher levels with certain oddball party compositions, which kinda takes out some of the fun.

It doesn't take itself to seriously, although you can purchase Gold with real money, but there doesn't seem any real need so I would avoid this. You can farm monsters and do numerous quests like any good RPG. Quests normally revolve around killing monsters and trravelling a bit, so nothing new there.			"

												I really loved the game. It took me 20 hours to complete, which includes a restart after some hours when I had unlocked more interesting characters than the starting lineup. I'll have to go back and finish it with the ones I missed in the future. The game was a lot of fun, and definitely worth the asking price. It made me smile many times, what with all those wacky references to other games and developers. I bought the Deluxe edition to support the developers as much as I could, as I had researched the game prior to buying it, and I'm glad I did. The extra gold you start with is nice (but doesn't provide any sort of advantage other than when you get a full lineup but let's face it, it doesn't matter).If you're on the fence, then just go ahead and spend the 10 euro or whatever the price is in your region. It's a fun throwback to the golden ages of gaming, and it's just well done through and through. I doubt very much you'll regret it. Don't worry about the ingame cash shop. I never used it, and NEVER had a reason to. You earn redicilous amounts of gold in this game just doing the main quest line, and the extra gold you can buy for real money is so useless, I'm puzzled why they added it at all.			"

												I enjoy the premise of this game, the core idea that it tries to emulate with a twist, a DnD session where you can customize and control the players and the room that the game takes place in, even the dungeon master. I will say that the game does have charm and has a good art direction, though I would say that there should have been more effort in the pixel art. However, it has both condensed and distilled the core elements of pen and paper gaming to a level which is far too simplistic for me to enjoy. The combat is shallow, the quests are repetitive, and the stats and perks are shallow and hardly feel like they matter. The UI is also highly simplistic and does not even provide important information efficiently or at all. I am sure that this is a fun bathroom game on a mobile device or something on the go, but the flaws of this game impeded my enjoyment of this game and cannot recommend this game to people who want an enthralling experience.

												Imagine playing table top D&D, and getting sucked into the world of Nintendo, where you are still playing Table top D&D, only you are playing it as an NES video game. That pretty much sums up this game in a nutshell, only you play it on the PC. It looks like an old school NES game, but incorporates the table top D&D feel, Very interesting concept. Much different than the early video game D&D adventures, this game tries to stay true to old school D&D. I thought it was a fun little game and would recommend it, because it can be picked up for next to nothing or even free and if you enjoy anything D&D related, you should at least give it a try. Get ready for a Nostalgia rush.			"

												It suits mobile gaming very well. But to sit down at a PC and grind through the countless encounters to experience a meme-ridden story? It's a chore. A gigantic chore. I say this having spent 14 hours on it. It has its charms in the beginning, but its gold reliance and grindiness will turn you off before long.			"

												I really liked the design concept of the game. Ideally it gives you the freedom of exploring a vast, magical world and design your own adventure. It has the potential of becoming a tool kit for creative story telling with its pre-existing mechanics, however, that being said, all the stories within the game are all pre-written and quite limited. The game does a nice job in trying to replicate the feeling of being both in a real world and an imaginary one when playing DnD by allowing the player to purchase object in the ""real world"" with the gold you get in the game world while these items would aid you in games. The downside of this is that the game gets extremely grindy after some hours of playing. The characters of the game are relatively diverse, yet they only have 4 moves each, which makes the combat pattern repetitive. The style of the game is an 8-bit pixle art type, which is fine ---- gives me a feeling of Pokemon Leafgreen. The soundtrack of the game becomes really loopy, and seems rather limited. I would prehaps give the game a 6/10 as a decent time killer. A good game if on a discount (say for 3 or 4 dollars), but would not recommend buying for 10 dollars.			"

												7.1/10 - An RPG Focused on Battles!This is an interesting twist to the RPG genre; Battles similar to an RPG maker, but with a little more freedom. There is no exploration, just a map view, battles and quests. You can dictated the number of enemies you face and build a team up to (5) players.The game is ultra-focused on the combat so I did get bored after a few hours. I personally wouldn't pay full price for this game; but on sale it's worth the pick-up.Worth $4-5 if you enjoy RPG fights! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												At first, Knights of Pen and Paper was VERY fun. I enjoyed the little jabs the GM gave, I felt like I was being challenged fairly, it felt like I was playing a fun little tabletop. I even bought the Halloween DLC because I was having such a good time with it.But then the challenges became SO exhausting. Toward the end it feels like you're just stuck in mud and can't progress no matter how high you level up. It stopped being fun and became a chore. If you enjoy grinding this game could be for you. Personally, not a big fan.			"

												I can describe Knights of Pen and Paper as a Dungeons & Dragons simulator instead of your typical RPG. There is no exploration or movement. It is all menu and dialog based. The map is pretty segmented like a Mario map and there are not maps so much as there are quests. These quests revolve around typical and simplified RPG turn based combat. The catch is you also play your own dungeon master, so you can select your enemies to fight and how many you will fight. Its as if you're making your own busy work. The classes feel balanced, but the battles begin feel too long for the never ending grind that this game becomes. Unless you want to spend real money to buy in game gold.The game has a lot of personalization. You start the game selecting characters and their classes. Each character has its own passive ability and then you assign a class. You can only have one of a class per party. Each class has 4 upgradeable abilities, some are passives like regenerate HP per turn and most are combat abilities. When you level up through experience defeating enemies, you can level up a skill. Leveling up skills increases the MP they use, so its a double edged sword where eventually you can only use a skill once or twice before you need to rest or use potions. There are items that will regenerate MP and HP along with increase maximums.The combat abilities feel useful. Paladins have a leader strike that is a powerful attack. The strike will increase their threat to enemies driving the majority of attacks to that character. To balance the attention, the paladin has a temporary shield power, a flash heal for themselves and devotion that increases the base HP. A cleric can heal the entire party or focus healing on one character. They can also use a smite skill that damages an enemy and heals themselves. To round things out there is a weakening spell to debuff enemy attack power for three enemies. Mages have a single enemy damaging fireball that will burn them, damaging HP each turn. They also have a deep freeze that damages and stuns an enemy. Mages also have a meteor that damages an entire enemy party and finally a passive stream that increases the base MP. I can't cover all the classes, but they feel well rounded. The classes have to feel well rounded, because the game is nothing but combat. A chess game between you and enemies that you chose to fight. The game has plenty of quests to give you and you can tackle them one at a time. Nothing that will stump you, since all the 'quests' seem to be collect X amount of Y or defeat X amount of Y enemies. Escort X from point A to B and then fight a battle. It wouldn't seem like such a grind if your travel had more exploration instead of moving along a line from location to location. There is some banter along the way, but its just your party sitting at a table facing a dungeon master with different beautiful backgrounds. The battles get long, even with better equipment. It gets frustrating when you complete a quest to kill 7 plants only to get another quest to kill 9 plants. Then that quest followed by another quest to get 19 carrots. How? By killing the same plants you've just slaughtered. You can always pick your quests, but its useless when you'll end up doing them all anyway.When you visit a town, you don't walk to a store, you just click on an icon that will open up the store. The items are nice. Upgrading weapons and armor involves a gambling system. Sure it costs 150 gold to have a blacksmith upgrade your gear, but there's only a 35% chance he'll succeed. Seems like a gamble and a waste of gold. The blacksmith will get better with every try . You can even increase the blacksmith's experience by using grindstones that you'll buy or find in caves.That leads me to warn you of this. Microtransactions. Why grind for gold when you can just buy it with real life money? The microtransactions aren't in your face or annoying, but they are there and some people have problems with that. If you want gold, go kill some enemies, there's nothing else to do in the game.If someone in your party dies, that costs gold. Since resurrection costs gold, when your party gets wiped out and you don't have enough gold to resurrect one of them, that's it. It was originally a gameover, because the game will save itself preventing you from going back to a previous point when your party was alive. So you'd have to buy gold with real life money. Luckily, there is now a free continue that will resurrect everyone, but reset their level experience. I'm thankful of that. If you don't want to grind to level up your characters, you can always buy experience with gold. There is always a need for gold. Whether its experience, resurrection, traveling, or gambling to upgrade your equipment. Oh and don't forget buying stuff.At some point, this game is busy work and you know some people are ok with that. In all, I would say its a fun game, but other RPGs are better. Since this is trying to be a Dungeons & Dragons simulator without being a true RPG its just lacking in some areas.			"

												The game started quite nice. Humor was pretty good, gameplay was quite a chilling experience. Bu as soon as 3 hours passed, it got so repetitive, that I had to force myself to go through with the story. Combat mechanics and character development are heavily underdeveloped here, and considering that's basically 70% of the game... well, that's bad.			"

												Cute concept for a game. Unfortunately, the novelty wears off fairly quickly, and the actual gameplay just doesn't hold up. Traditional jRPGs are carried by their characters and story, because the combat and mechanics thereof are so one-dimensional and stale.So Knights of Pen and Paper has the same boring combat as any Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest/Final Fantasy/etc game, but all the writing, charm, and polish has been replaced by easy jokes about RPG tropes.If RPGs are played for the story, where's the story? I guess the gag is that there is no story, that this is the RPG stripped down and laid bare. I can buy that. But since there's no gameplay worth noting, does that joke really carry a game for 5+ hours? I don't think it does. The premise is done a hundred times better by Half Minute Hero - which has all the same lazy RPG ""observational humor"", but uses it as a fluffy coat to the solid framework of fun, interesting gameplay. I recommend you pick that up, instead. Knights of Pen and Paper isn't worth the time it takes to finish it, much less the asking price.			"

												Don't let the complaints fool you. This is actually a great arcade classic turn-based RPG experience. Think of the original Final Fantasy games, in a much more fun, comedic fashion, but still has the challenge, and core elements you love. You will go on grand adventures, fighting many various foes with a pretty good storyline.There's options to increase the challenge for even greater rewards / xp, loot, etc. etc. vamping the difficulty that suits you.It's hard to explain all the qualities that makes this game so cute, and enjoyable, but I think it's definitely something every RPG fan would love to play for a few hours. The main downside people seem to complain about is that there's one very small in-game real money shop, which you can pay like $1-5 for in-game gold. The game is not balanced around this shop, and I've never once understood why it was in the game. Perhaps it's for ""stupid people"" who make foolish decisions, or need a ""boost"", but I did not need it.However, I did decide to go with the digital deluxe edition for $1 more, which comes with a lot of goodies, including a new character, 800 starting gold, some minor boosts and a new area with a monster super effective to all dmg. (fast easy xp + gold)I paid: $3.75 (digital deluxe)Reccomended price: $5			"

 This isn't a terribly bad game, but it's fun is very fleeting and you'll forget about it the minute you exit out of it. The premise was cool and was the main reason I bought it but they really didn't do anything with it - the characters are all interchangable (literally) and the dialog seems to be aimed at kids - the humor is mostly refrencing things and changing one word or changing it slightly (Wizards of the East Coast, HAHAHAHA). You set your own pace on everything, like choosing which enemies you want to fight and how many, so the game never really suprises or challenges you. The quests are boring and all feel like sidequests (kill this many things, go here, collect this many things, blahblahblah). They've taken microtransactions out of the game but you can tell a lot of the mechanics were set up with those in mind.They do have some neat things like the ability to buy upgrades and powerups for the 'real life' players, and these upgrades carry over different saves, but there isn't enough of this and you'll have most the things you want rather early on. The graphics are pretty nice as well, if you like the 8bit style. This game is probably better played on a phone or mobile device, this isn't a terrible port but it shows it was made for a touch screen in mind - for example you have to select the enemy to attack every time. I'd recommend buying this on a mobile touch screen device, it'll prob cost less - also it'd be easier to play it in short bursts like it is prob meant to be played.In short, they botched it.			"

												Played this alittle on the mobile tablet quite long ago,seeing its on discount on Steam,thought I'll give it another go.The game does look better on a smaller screen,pixel art ain't pretty.Some of the small details and animations in the background looks intriguing.From start to mid-levels, the game is interesting,much to consider, which party members to decide, paths to attain achievements.Some of the small jokes  may  seem funny for some.When you had setup the proper lineup to use,the game becomes a clicker game,same attacks and spells, every battle, only difference is whom had the initiatives.Repetative actions till the end.Loots from battles are off,a battle of 7 hard enemies with a party of 50s,the reward is 1 coin low level items.Makes me wonder ' was it worth it '.Watching the horse gallop back and fro the map, can get dull and boring.The game have some serious issues in saving achievements.As many had mentioned in the forums, several achievements are broken.Had to go through 2 restarts, 5 playthroughs to finally trigger all the achievements.Overall.The game is playable.Interesting to start, a drag till the end.Process for achievement is a tough one.

												First of all, there was an update that killed save files, which is a big problem for an RPG of this length.  I wasn't interested in replaying the first ten hours of the game, so I've never played it since then.  I'm not really sure what the developers were thinking.  It was an old game when the patch came out, so the loss of save files was definitely unexpected.Also, it's pretty dumb that if you already have some of the DLC from buying the +1 Edition, you can't just buy the extra DLC you're missing without rebuying it with the base game.  Come on now.As for the game itself, I would rate as so-so.  The theme and art is top-notch, but everything else becomes kind of a drag as you keep playing.  There's way too many boring encounters.  Some of the areas seem really poorly balanced-- I went into a dungeon with a level rating lower than my party's, and was basically insta-killed (had zero problems up to that point).  You might like it a little better than I did if you're a big fan of grindy RPGs, because there's a LOT of grinding.  What kept me playing was the witty writing, but it wasn't quite strong enough to carry the game on its own.			"

												A fun little twist on the typical computer RPG, where you are both the DM and the players.  It does get a bit grindy, and there's little to no storyline to speak of, but I have yet to see another RPG-like game that incorporates the meta concept at all, let alone as well as this one does.  The concept is interesting, and while combat does get repetitive and you end up doing a lot of gold-farming, the tongue-in-cheek dialogue and easter eggs help keep it interesting.This is, admittedly, the kind of game that's best played in short bursts rather than long sessions, but if you remember the days of 8-bit games and wonder what computerized D&D could have been like back then... this isn't a perfect approximation, but it's a fun little game that's worth a try, particularly if you can get it on sale.

												I'm really bored at my computer one night and find a game that is having a sale that just covers my left over money from my steam wallet. So I buy it after realizing how little space it occupies, and have the time of my life. The game is about a group of people (that you choose, each having their own perks in the game) play a game of D&D. You start off slowly, but then begin find a sense of fun in it somewhere. This game can get a bit repetitive and boring at times, but it's really worth it. I can't get too excited with it, but you can easily lose yourself in this game when you get down to the grind and try to clear a dungeon. There can be cheap situations where you die easily, but for me, it wasn't unbearable. I don't normally appreciate these kinds of games, with this being a major exception. Although I can't give it a high rating, I can at least recommend it to my friends and family.			"

												A great casual game. It really only has the one game mechanic, as if you're in a battle in a final fantasy game, or any turn-based RPG - Each turn you choose to battle / magic / item, and your party defeats monsters. An interesting aspect of this game is that you control the number and difficulty of most of the encounters. But graphically, there is not much beyond what you see in the trailer. Besides the world map, and the table where your party sits, you don't move around.It could get boring for some, if you're not looking for an endless battle; but the game is as difficult or as easy as you choose to make it. I definitely think it's worth it. It's very easy to pick up and play a few minutes at a time, as there's no learning curve.

												I really like this game, it's genuinely a fun and simple tactical RPG, but after a few hours it became really tiresome. I wish it was more robust, more complex. I wish it had more varied locations, way more frequent epic boss fights. There's great humor in it, but it needs a lot more dialogue or even dialogue choices. Overall it's a rather simple representation of a Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game & it is really fun, but really becomes a chore after a while. I'm hoping the sequel fixed some of my complaints. Despite its shortcomings I'll recommend it because it's well priced, simple, but fun, for a while at least.			"

												This is a game you will love or hate depending on your tolerance for RPG tropes. The best parts are when it succesfully makes fun of the cliches of CRPG's while bringing a sense of humour about what makes the pen and paper versions so much fun. At its worst it IS those cliches. One of the things I really disliked was that to upgrade your characters standard weapons and armour costs a fortune at the blacksmith and requires extensive upgrades to get above a less than %50 chance of the upgrade being successful (Your money, which is in short suppy, is spent regardless). You can upgrade the chance by getting grindstones, but GRIND is the opperative word. Grindstones are only available in caves and there is only a precentage of getting one for each ore pile you click on. You will need to go back to these places again and again and again to try to get enough grindstones to raise the chance of an upgrade succeeding more than %50 of the time. I do like it, but with caveats. If you can tolerate the random grinding required, go for it.Pros:         Good sense of humour        Graphics have a lot of charm        Chirpy retro musicCons:         Grinding         Repetition         Rinse/repeat         Tear enducing upgrade system "

												Pretty fun oldschool feel game. Some people don't like this game because it has a micro payement system in it where you can buy extra gold with your creditcard, but it is really not needed to do that. In fact, it would spoil the fun of the game and it reduces the total play time. So yes, specially when you see it on sale it is a good buy if you like these kind of games.7.5/10			"

												Its a neat concept, but the gameplay boils down to grinding and spending money (and you can only get money by grinding or paying real cash).In addition, its one of those games where upgrading equipment has a failure chance. When you fail (and you only have a 35% success chance), the money is lost and you have nothing to show for the 20 minutes of your life that you spent grinding to get it. There's no skill involved in this either. The only thing you could have done to increase your chance of success was to buy certain items beforehand, which you can only pay for through relentless grinding, or paying real cash. You may be noticing a trend.			"

												Suffers horribly from effects of a phone game meant to drain wallets to advance.  Tried playing it again after a few years of it just sitting installed.  Without using cheatengine or a similar program to give gold, you will find yourself spending vast amounts of time in the farm area obtaining it.  Then seeing the same quotes played repeatedly going back to town to buy grindstones and upgrade the blacksmith before returning again.  The system itself would be great for a normal turn based rpg similar to Dragon Quest, but the terms of grind versus receiving spartan bits of plot makes investing the time to complete the game not worth it.

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a tongue-in-cheek look at table top RPGs. The characters are silly, the ""microtransactions"" even sillier, and the references to other video games and people in the industry is, quite frankly, horrible (but in a silly way). The entire game has your characters sitting at a table in various places such as a village, a cave, an arcade, and so on, while a DM (Dungeon Master, for those of you who are unfamiliar with pen and paper RPG terminology) guides them through their quests. The graphics are simple, but fit well with the game. The music is repetitive, but catchy. And there's loads of replay value. I definitely recommend getting this game.			"

												This game easily could have been a free-to-play-game, but once you start playing, you realize that it IS a game you can play without restrictions. The idea of a table in the middle of the screen sounded weird, but you actually don't notice it in mid-battle. This is an awesome game.    It's simple enough to just pick up and play, but you can still work out a winning strategy. Think of it like Pokemon. You can kinda ignore the stats and get through the game, but you can also maximize your team's potential by equiping certain items. So if you don't want to think about it, you can make it through, but if you do the math, you can do better. It's. Just. Awesome. You can go pretty much anywhere right from the start, but you'll probably die if you do. But that's still an option.    I recommend reading a guide before playing, as there is some terms you probably won't understand, but it's smooth sailing from there.			"

												It's like Dungeons & Dragons, minus the need for friends. One time I was playing this and 5 hours ended up passing before I realized it when I thought I had only been playing for 2 hours. 15/18But seriously though, it's like DnD, except you control everything that happens, from how many enemies you fight in each encounter (most of the time) to which quests you do to how many characters you have in your party at one time.It's a pretty meta game, calling upon/calling out various things you'd normally find in a DnD campaign and other tropes relative to table top RPGs, but at the same time it's pretty genre savvy in and of itself, so if you're familiar with these kinds of games, you'll probably get a kick outta the dialogue.There's also a sequel available too if you like this then be sure to check that one out as well.

												Maybe this game works well on a cellphone but to sit down and deliberately play it on a PC is laughable. The gameplay is so incredibly shallow you can win practically every encounter by closing your eyes and clicking your mouse unless you try to stack the odds against yourself (which you will since every fight is so simple) and even then your rampant clicking will only be broken up to cast a healing spell now and then. There just isn't anything to it. You can pick multiple classes for your heroes but besides the 4 different abilities they all feel like they play the same. I couldn't even explain what was going on with the gold system. Everything at the store costs 1-5 coins and monsters drop a few coins here and there...but I started with like 5000 gold for some reason. I’m not entirely sure but I feel like the game tried to balance out the absence of micro-transactions of its mobile game counterpart by dumping all the gold in the world in my pocket and calling it square.If this game has anything going for it, it’s the sprite work which is very pretty and the music is pleasant but everything is massively let down by how unstimulating the game feels. It's not a BAD game but its a pretty BLAH game "

												Despite no mention of it anywhere, this game contains microstransactions that will make the game easier. This means that on top earning money through game sales themselves, the game is continually monetised through the sale of more in game currency. It also suggests that the difficulty and the amount of mindless grinding required in the game to progress is geared toward frustrating you into getting out your wallet to buy progress with real world cash.This business model is unacceptable. If I pay money for a game I expect there to be a final transaction for me to enjoy the game as is. When I'm expected to buy my progress through the game on the other hand, under no circumstances do I want to pay money up front, especially not without being notified of these transactions. I don't want to pay a fair price for a game only to find out that I will have to invest a lot more to really enjoy it.The game itself seemed clever at times, but I soon felt forced to either grind through enemies at a boringly slow pace or fork over real cash.

												I bought the expansion, I beat the game. And I was very disappointed.This game pretends to be themed around pen and paper roleplaying, the type that has real choices and such, not just murdering for EXP. What did we get instead? The complete opposite of the pen and paper experience. This is another bad digital RPG that any P&P player would find boring.So reviewing it for what it really is, a lackluster generic RPG, it's STILL shamefully bad. It tries to make up it's lack of creativity with unending references. Not one of these references were really funny or clever. On top of that, nothing in this came off as original at all.If I ever had a GM make a campaign that was 100% references and forced us to battle everyone we met? I'd tell him he sucked and then leave. If this was even remotely accurate to P&P games, there'd be an option to seduce every single enemy encounter. You know? SOME choice at least to do something else!TL;DRFalse advertising. Just a really bad RPG made by a bunch of meme kids.			"

												Not really a fun game... more of a satire/parody, and kinda bland compared to what I researched before buying.Bugged achievements also bug the hell out of me.The random dice rolls aren't really a sense of random, its not something you have control over as in it doesn't need to be there, it's like a sign saying You Suck rather than just hide it. Unlike old Final Fantasy games your random encounters just occur randomly, you don't need a dice that you have 0 control over to place it in your face.I feel it's there just to ♥♥♥♥ me off, and there's no benefit to having a success roll except for enchanting weapons.Game is also extremely short.

												I picked up this game because it seemed to be a novel experience. Admittedly the first hour or so was very entertaining. The witty dialogue constantly breaks the fourth wall, and the Rollplay mechanics where fun for a while. Unfortunately the gameplay does not change very much after the first hour. The quests lack any distinction(the game breaks all quests down into a few archetypes), the progression system deteriorates into bland stat increases(each character has only 4 abilities), and the game's pacing entices the player to utilize the game's microtransactions to level quicker or buy better gear.There are unlockable characters, but to use them in the current playthrough you would need to spend some time leveling them from lvl 1 or use them in a a new playthrough.After a while the game slows to an almost literal grind. Enjoyment is derived by being able to jump in and out of over a VERY long period of time. Haven't beaten it yet but, it's pretty light and shallow so far.			"

All the 90's references can't make up for Knights of Pen and Paper's grinding, mobile roots.Pros: Graphics, Sounds, ControlsCons: Gameplay, Story, BugsFor fans of pixel graphics, Knights of Pen and Paper will not disappoint, although it may be a waste of most computers' potential.  The sounds and music fit well, although they may begin to grate after a few hours.  Control with the mouse and the smallish menus are perfect.Unfortunately, the grindy, repetitive gameplay is where Knights of Pen and Paper shows its mobile roots.  The story isn't terrible, but lacks the great moments often had whilst playing true tabletop RPGs.  For achievement hounds, the Deluxe Edition is a must, as it provides a slightly better grinding area.  A number of achievement bugs ensure that the grind lasts many hours longer than it should.Knights of Pen and Paper is a throwback game in many ways, but a number of flaws mar it severly.5/10			"

												Quite enjoyable.  Perhaps the jokes are obvious as some reviews have said, but they're still fun.The game is better if your computer is a touch-screen as this is a mobile port.  Mouse clicking is kind of a drag primarily because of this reason (click the Skills button, now move the mouse up to click the thing you want to attack, now move back down to click the Skills button of the next hero, now back up to click the enemy, now back down...).  It would have been better to add some keyboard/controller support.But, speaking of the whole ""mobile port"" thing, it IS nice that I can transfer my save file from my Android device and play my current game on my PC and Mac.  I've gone between all three platforms without too much trouble--just save it to my choice of cloud storage and then download it into the game file folders to play from where I left off.  The fact that there isn't Steam Cloud is a bummer, but since Steam doesn't have a client on Android, it doesn't matter too much for me.Overall, very nice little game.  Grab it on sale and have some old-school fun.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a solid game, but not a perfect one. It has fairly well thought out mechanics and there is nothing you can do in the game that the game itself doesn’t make intuitive to do, but there are multiple points when the difficulty-curve is not so well designed, even going so far as to require you to grind well after finishing every quest in the game save one that is actually HARDER then the last main quest of the game.It is also very simple. In fact many would probably call this game an RPG-lite and they would not be wrong. Despite the new angle of playing the people around the table instead of the heroes on their character sheets, this game is overall a very simple title… simple enough I was not surprised to see the game is readily available, not just on the PC, but on mobile phones.This makes for a surprisingly good game overall, but not one designed to be played over long sessions. Rather, it’s a series of bite-sized sessions that will ultimately get you through the to the end, assuming you have the patients to get through some of the later muck.Full review is available at http://redsectorshutdown.blogspot.com/2017/03/knights-of-pen-and-paper-pc-review.html "

												As much as I wanted to be able to recommend this game as at least a casual mindless fun type of title, it turns out that the game is not even successful at that. The game's premise of telling a story from the point of view of people playing a Tabletop RPG is played painfully straight without any humor involved other than the premise itself. The game also provides no attempts at being an authentic Tabletop RPG experience by being restrictively linear and having a fixed storyline. Speaking of which, the game's story has no sense of atmospheric or emotional depth and is paper thin, no pun intended, and is literally the most generic and bare bones story you can think of for a fantasy game. Again no attempts are made to actually make this interesting or relate it to the game's premise. The gameplay is made up entirely of fetch quests that are normally reserved for sidequests, and there is no exploration included at all. The game will stop being fun after about an hour. Also the game features micro-transactions in the form of buying in game money with real world money, and the game's design seems to be based around making you use up as much in game money as possible. Traveling to new locations, reviving dead partners both cost in game money despite making no logical sense why this should be the case. Up grading weapons is something that costs an absurd amount of money to attempt, but it starts out with only a 35% chance of working, and the only way to increase that percentage is to successfully upgrade weapons. Because of this, you will likely go through all your in game money really quickly, and seeing as how money takes a ridiculously long time to farm in this game, it seems entirely likely that the idea was to get you to use the micro-transactions.This game is not recommended.Full Review Here http://www.gamefaqs.com/PC/708672-knights-of-pen-and-paper-1-edition/reviews/156854 "

												In a word: Avoid. Read on for reasons.A game that simulates pen and paper RPGs? Sounds great, doesn't it? This game will do just that, but the Dungeon Master is largely unamusing, which leads to a mundane story. The comments your party makes are usually cheesy one-liners or memes, or video game references. You roll a d20 for quests, upgrading gear, getting grindstones in caves, resting in non-towns, and travelling, and failing a dice roll only makes the game more tedious. The battle system is all turn-based, and order is loosely based on initiative, but it's mostly random.A more minor point though are the microtransactions for in-game gold which are COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY but for some reason every day some guy will complain about ""ermergerd microtransactions"" in the community hub. The microtransactions are NOT REQUIRED at any point in the game; the microtransactions only help you by shaving off a few minutes of your time that would otherwise have been spent doing what you already have to do for the entire game. The microtransactions only give you gold. You get gold from fighting monsters. For the obsessive, completionist players:As of typing up this post there are at least 5 broken achievements out of 43. Apparently there have been inquiries sent to the developers asking when the achievements will be fixed, and the answer provided was that the devs were busy working on another project that isn't Knights of Pen and Paper. tl;dr:Do not buy, because:1. Unoriginal plot2. Ridiculously random3. Unnecessarily tedious4. Broken achievements			"

												If you've ever played an mmo like WoW and during the quests you would often get to get x amount of y thing or kill x amount of z monsters and you thought, ""Holy crap that sounds, and is, like the most fun I have ever had!"" then this game is for you!It starts off grabing your interest with a prision escape and a cute art style and 'dnd' type set up, but quickly wears down into a slogging grind fest. There isn't any decisions to be made (As one would expect from a dnd game) or strategy, and there isn't even any dice rolling aside from travel or sleeping. The classes are un balanced like crazy. The mage and the cleric are easily the best classes in the game. The rogue is in 3rd at average and the warrior and paladin are just complete garbage. The characters dont do anything story wise and there is no banter or personality to them.The character sheets are pretty boring. Each character gets 3 active skills and 1 passive that you can level up. However the skills are just about asa basic and uninteresting as you can get. The mage has a fireball, Frostbolt, meteor, and mana increase skill. The Cleric has smite, heal all, heal one, and a damage debuff skill. The rogue has a stealth, double strike, disable, and posion skill. The warrior has a healing, damage debuff, cleave, and one more skill I forgot. And the paladin has a shield, heal, aggro strike, and defense increase skill. B-O-R-I-N-G!!!You do have a nice selection of buyable items to give buffs thought. Various items/props/food and even the dm can be changed. I do think that is nice and adds some charm to the game. The equipable items however, are again boring +to stat upgrades. Nothing cool or interesting.I hate not recommending this game as it is a solid concept that I hope to see expanded and improved in the future, but in its current state it just isn't worth your time or money.

People who bought it on release were ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about the microtransactions.Now that the microtransactions have been patched out, it plays like a game with too many ♥♥♥♥ing escort and item collection quests.

												If you like classic Tabletop/RPGs then this brings the best of both worlds together (Tabletop and Video Games).Controls are so simplistic and the game runs on very little resources that a lower end mini tablet can run this game without any problems, while still offering that classic RPG challenge.The references and Easter Eggs that pay homage to older RPG style games are just the + in ""+1 Edition""If you find yourself looking for some time to kill I recommend playing this game (at full price, but you can never beat a good deal).

												To preface this, I won this in a giveaway (on steamgifts)...I absolutely enjoyed this game.  I am currently going through a D&D cycle of obsession right now and this totally fit the video game need for that in a really odd way.  The game itself is fun as it totally pokes fun of all the nerdiness that is associated with table top role playing games.  It functions pretty well overall, but you can definitely power play this and not have as much enjoyment.  This leads me to believe it has a bit of a balance issue, but it doesn't really matter too much.The controls and interface are pretty straight forward, no issues at all. I didn't try to see if there were hotkeys for the characters ablities as I was just playing with my mouse mostly. Overall I would give this a 10/15.  4/5 for controls, 3/5 for gameplay, and 3/5 for graphics.			"

												This game is really great.The story line is funny and there's plenty of eastereggs to find.The concept of gaining gold to buy more or new party members is fun and the fact that the gold can be used for items that change the status effects in the game (the game that they play) is really neat.And the meta. This game really uses the whole meta concept so nicely, that I haven't played another game that does is quite this well.Theres plenty of replayability, since you unlock more characters as you play and there's those nice achievements to get, from playing with different charanter setups. Some of the achievements are actually quite hard to do, which just makes it more enjoyable.The game can get quite repetative and combat can drag out a little, so it becomes more of a grind than a fun experience. But for me the promise of what happens when you get to the next part of the story is enough to get me through it. It you really hate repeating the same pattern over and over again in order to win fights, then I would not recommend playing this game.This game does deliver what it promises though.8/10 since the grind does drag it down a little			"

												If you're a GFX junkie, then this game certainly is not for you. Graphics and mucis are all 8bit and at first glance the game itself seems to be written in some old version of BASIC on a Comodore 64 (which is actually quite possible :D). But underneat that layer of all that 8bit gloss there's an extremely fun game!This game is full of humor and all standard old-school pen-n-paper RPG clichés that you have probably done when you actually played those pen-n-paper games with friends. Sadly though, that DM kinda sucks. If I had him for a DM in my pen-n-paper sessions, we'd have long discussions about NPC naming, story telling and such. But I think this is most likely yet an other prank from the developers :pI picked it up for €2,50 on the sale today, but if I knew this game was so much fun, I would have bought it earlier and have paid the €10 as well. It's really worth it, so much fun this game gives me!			"

												This game is based heavily on grinding, which I guess is par for the course for what was originally a phone title. Gotta sell those IAPs!This would not be so bad if the game was actually free-to-play, or if the RPG mechanics were any good. After all, lots of titles in the genre have a bunch of grinding at their core and still manage to be fun.Unfortunately, combat is shockingly shallow, character building and crafting might as well not be there, and while the quest structure is framed in an original/cute way, it just underlines how barebones everything is.I was also put off by the shameless, constant nerd pandering -- which mostly takes the form of (you guessed it) lazy pop-culture references, but you also get healthy doses of terrible banter of course.Not the most enjoyable way to waste your time, even if you can get it for cheap/free.

												Now here's a charming tidbit of experimental gaming. A player pretending to be players role playing a game. It could have gone so wrong, but the developers understand that brevity is the better part of expression, and choice representations of tranditional pen and paper role playing cement this as a must play for anyone curious enough to give this a second look.It may take you that long to realize just what's happening, but once you do you'll probably be hooked ensuring your Grandma has her 17th level Paladin wearing fully upgraded equipment. The biggest drawback is the titles in game currency, which on iOS translates to real world microtransactions. Fortunately you can quest your way through earning all of the gold you'll need to pay for all of your upgrades.This is an addictive game, and the pixel art style has its appeal, through does not appear to scale well to all resolutions. A minor gripe, as the gameplay is the most compelling aspect. You'll want to grind away so your players can have the leveling high. There's no doubt this is a niche experience, but one you'll no doubt remember. A little pricey solo, I'd suggest buying the bundle of both Knights of Pen and Paper I and its sequel in one package (available via either of the games Steam pages).			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a blast. I love turn-based RPGs and this game is an excellent one that has a solid mixture of gameplay, humor and replay value that took me by surprise. To start off with, if you enjoy turn-based RPGs then this is worth buying. Read on for a more in-depth review.In Knights of Pen and Paper you play as some friends sitting around a table and playing a Dungeons and Dragons-like game. You pick out your party and set up their class before the game begins which I thought was pretty cool. Typically new characters are introduced throughout the game, so it's interesting that we get to create our own dream team to play with. That's not all. You'll still find more characters throughout your time in the game. They'll offer new classes to use which you can switch out whenever you're not in combat. I found the cast of Knight of Pen and Paper to be nothing less than diverse and clever.The gameplay is pretty basic at far as turn-based RPGs go. Each party member and enemy will get a turn, and you're given a bar showing who's turn is when so you can plan out your turns accordingly. Leveling is a lot of fun as you get to unlock new abilities and see how each of these characters evolve. For me, the true appeal of Knights of Pen and Paper is its presentation. The story isn't groundbreaking--it's about as generic as any quest in Dungeons and Dragons could be. However, the characters themselves are entertaining as the story plays out. The developers did a great job of portraying all the party members as human beings who with personalities. Sometimes someone will question the logic of something absurd happening and is quickly told to shut up by the game master. I also remember one character being jubilant in defeating a boss and the text-based dialogue was perfect. Whenever I saw the speech bubbles appear I got a little excited.Knights of Pen and Paper is a solid game. It's got a classic feel to the gameplay, it has amazing presentation and it doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Even if you've never played a turn-based RPG, this is a game that would be the perfect entry to the genre.			"

												Overall this is a fun game with a few downsides.Pros:- graphics- music- references and jokes- this is a long game- character building (you can respec skills for small amount of gold)- fights are fun- game about playing a role-playing game- insane and fun plot- DLC is fair and square. It's a long, Halloween themed, series of quests.- some classes are really powerfulCons:- some classes are relatively weak- repetitive quests - that are fun nonetheless, due to amusing writing- grinding gold and XP - you really need to grind a lot of gold and XP just to advance further- upgrading weapons and armors takes too much gold- some fights take too long to finish- this game is mainly about fighting enemies- the plot develops fully only after playing like about 10 hours into the game, before that one point it's mainly a fantasy parody- you see those Space Invaders and school bullies in trailer? Good, you'll encounter them after about 10 hours of gameplay- one bad decision during buying stuff or upgrading weapons/armor can result in a need to grind more gold for about half an hourTo be honest - I've had a blast of a time with this game. It was fun, jokes were really good, the plot was absolutely insane. I can recommend playing this game if you like parody games that have focus on battles. Drop it if you don't like too much fighting and grinding gold/xp on same enemies over and over again.______For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												""Now THIS is what I call of Retro Love Letter, folks.""After playing a said 15 hours throughout the game, I couldn't help but put it down with a smile.Before I begin, there are several things you should know: Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition isn't a perfect game. Not even close. But that being said, it is some of the most humourous, most rewarding and most awkwardly endearing RPGs I've played in a while.It's pretty much a heartfelt love letter to retro gamers and DND gamers like myself; plenty of brilliant references (""Journey"" Village, anyone?), a hilariously cheesy plot, as well as there being plenty of fun things to go around.While most RPGs place you on the receiving end of the game, you both control the players AND the gamemaster; you control the characters' decisions and actions throughout the game, while you conduct any battles you choose of. Giving a total of 12 classes (I think; could be wrong) and 15 ""players"" to choose from, the game keeps things rather interesting with the gamers' unique quirks and diverse classes.While some complexity fans might find this a problem, the skill system isn't too deep. You generally have 1-3 something active powers wherein you have 1-3 passive powers. You upgrade it, and you get an increase of power in that skill. Personally, I found it enjoyable at the simplicity of the skill system, and wherein some hardcore gamers will probably be dissapointed, I found it organized and simple to enjoy the game.As for the story, while it's admittedly paper-thin, it's nonetheless enjoyable. You have a set of five gamers set out to save the world from rats, bandits, yetis, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(C), Pac-Man ghosts, fire hydrants (I kinda made that one up...), and YOUR MOM! No seriously, you actually fight your mom in this game as the equivalent of Kingdom Hearts 2's Sephiroth.Then you get to the quests of the game, which isn't as fun. It's practically divided into three types: defeat ""X"" Y times, escort/deliver/travel x to y/to y, and find X. But even then, I found enjoyment of it for the reason I'm going to list in a bit. A common complaint with the game is that it follows the typical cliches of an 8-bit RPG and too much repetition. But even then, the game damn well KNOWS it cliched! I can count the number of lampshadings how the ""hero arrives just in the nick of time"", but you get the idea. And honestly: was Secrets of Mana repetitve in some areas? Yes. Was Chrono Trigger repetitive in some areas? Yes indeed. Was Final Fantasy repetitive in some areas? Yes, yes it was. And that's what made the game so enjoyable in my opinion: how it lampoons every issue with classic RPGs while providing it a loving tribute to it. Along with the create design the game offers, it's hard not to love it.The game's only downside as far as I'm concerened, is the dungeons. Not only are the to few and to far, but the randomness of it, the pure frustration of the difficulty, and the fact that it's completely out of the players' control could've made it much better. But I guess that's the price for having a focus in an other area oh so much so.In the end, if you like action-packed gameplay, deep skill systems, and fast pacing, then this game will probably not be for you. However, if you love retro gaming, memorable, if not cheesy, writing, and incredible optimization, then you will love this game as much as I did.Overall Verdict: 9/10. Superb game, really recommend it for your steam library.			"

												Heh.-_-Okay, so: do you A.) Like Dungeons and Dragons-style adventuring games?B.) Like playing actual D&D style games, on pen and paper?C.) Would like to try a simulator of the two?This is that game. Will you like it? That's debatable.I bought this game when it was a daily deal because I like pen and paper D&D-style games. Note that I had received all of the boosts from the digital deluxe version.The retro-style graphics are a nice aesthetic, and there is quite a bit of variety with the creatures you will encounter in the game.So the game plays with you as the DM (dungeon master) overseeing a game of D20 Knights of Pen and Paper. You have seats that can sit how ever many characters you would like to use, but the last few seats require you to pay the in-game currency. You can keep grinding to afford the seats in the future.For each seat, you can sit a type of character (ex: hipster, grandma) and assign them a specific class (ex: barbarian, bard). This offers a seemingly wide range of party configurations.The difficulty is completely self-driven, as you are both the DM and the players. That being said, you may have an ""objective"" to kill 5 orcs - you can choose to fight them 1-at-a-time, or all at once, or whatever configuration you prefer. The entirety of the game involves A LOT of grinding, and this is even considering the boosts you may have gotten from the deluxe edition. I love D20 games, but this game can become repetitive extremely quickly. If there was a multiplayer cooperative functionality, it might have saved it a bit, however, there isn't one.There is A LOT of variety for you to upgrade - you can change everything from the type of table you're playing on (each type provides different bonuses) to the type of door in the room to the DM. All of this can help shape your overall party into a specfic area, like tanky high HP characters, or high MP, magic-relying casters.I paid ~$5 US for the deluxe edition, and I think even then you may want to hold off and wait for it to be cheaper, if you are interested in trying the game.

												This game is just absolutely fantastic! 20/D20I've been wanting to get involved in D&D for AGES but I just can't seem to a) Find any friends who want too b) Find any groups in my area that run a weekly or something.. A little sad.. But oh well I'll keep looking. In the meantime - This game fills that space perfectly! It's got quick wit, great humor, reflections on a vast array of older games; most of which I had a really nice time remembering thanks to this beauty!The gameplay is fairly quick and gets you into it without boring you in any way. A nice range of different classes, each one seperating it from the last meaning you can mix and match your 5-man squad quite a bit to your preferences!Difficulty can be .. Sort off.. Scaled. By choosing more enemies it makes it more difficult. I personally don't class this as 'difficulty' as such, and you can cheat the system by setting the enemies closer or further apart to suit your teams attack.. Though, even with 7 enemies sometimes it can be 'easy'.. This is a slight downside, but still isn't much of one and you won't be choosing 7 enemies to fight until you become stronger anyway, as it is generally too much (when matched against similar levels that is).But generally speaking this is a great game with tons of great moments!! If you're a fan of RPG's and D&D in general, you'll love this (I think..)!! :DPlus the new ones out soon!! Can't wait!!!			"

That being said, it's a real grindfest, even with enhancing items that cost lots of gold that you can only realistically get at the tail end of the campaign. The combat is simplistic, which only makes sense since this game is also on mobile phones, but that being said I had lots of fun mixing and matching my team of characters to complement their skills and otherwise challenge myself during boss fights.

												Knight of Pen & Paper is a simulator of RPG style combats. You can choose which monster to beat and how many of them. So you're totally free to put your own difficulty.The game reminds me of those old roleplays used to be ""played"" in forums:5 characters around a table with a master that is telling all the interactions you're doing with them. Plenty of environments, classes and monsters more or less tough are available during the quests.The bad point is the repetitive actions in combat, from a place to another you can't change your character because it will take too long to level. A character has only 4 skills, you can easily choose which skill is the best though you will note that the effects of a single skill does the same for every monster: An ice monster should be weak against fire. The mage class uses ""Fireball"", no effect. ""Deep Freeze"", super effective, and that against most of the monsters.Finally, the game should be fine for beginners, who never played any old RPG game before because Knights Of Pen & Paper is really easy to beat, hard with patience.Otherwise, I think the game would fit better on phone and tablets.

												Pretty brilliant. It's a turn based RPG, but it's not hard for noobies.You can balance it yourself by starting with more or less characters. I would strongly recommend starting with 5 players because the endgame is very hard otherwise.Other then that you really need to play it for an hour or two to find out if it's for you. I like the dry humor and pop culture references. And how it doesn't take itself too seriously. But some people call this 'lacking in depth' and I guess they're right too. They do re-use certain backgrounds and let you grind from level 32-37 and 1 mission later 37-45 at the end of the game, so they definitely rushed through the end trying to add some 'gameplay' without putting in work sadly. That level 50 mission is optional btw. Throughout the rest of the game there is rarely a need to grind though. Do note that the game has some large bugs. Some achievements are broken, some missions are broken, DLC doesn't work for some and there's graphical glitches. This seems like a hasty port honestly. And then there's the fact that if you want the Deluxier Edition you have to buy it at once. You can't upgrade. If you already have Normal edition or Deluxe edition (extra's, but no DLC) you're screwed. Also they just wiped everybody's saves trying to emplement the (not fully working) cloud save. Then wiped all saves again when reverting to the old build.So the game is very fun, but beware that this game is published by Paradox. As long as you're lucky enough to be in the 90% for whom most things don't break you're good. But if something goes wrong there's no support and dealing with Paradox is like talking to a 3 year old and when they realize you're right they just ignore you.I only recommend this game because it's unique. It's very money-grabby, too expensive and the publisher is unethical and clearly doesn't care about it's customers, but the game is so much  fun and most people don't care about what happens behind the scenes. And if I'd downvote it the fanboys would downvote this review and you wouldn't be reading about the downsides of this game right now.			"

												Pros:The game is kind of humorous.The backgrounds look nice.They removed microtransactionsCons:The gameplay lacks any depth.The game is super grindy.The game is REALLY resource intensive for what it is. (It uses 14% to 17% of my CPU just idling at the title screen.)Text is recycled far too often.The music isn't bad, but it is way too short. So in a given fight it probably loops 5 or 6 times.Alternate save files don't have independant gold, room items, characters, or classes; however, the blacksmith doesn't carry over. (The whole idea of all that being persistent is just stupid as it was physically impossible to get the game over achievement unless I deleted my save file.)More of a nitpick, but the developers made themselves the best characters in the game. (That's a bit too narassistic, in my opinion, and since they have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one-liners it ruins most of the fun of the game.)Overall:I got the game in a sale because it looked like it would fun to play. Little did I know I would just make a party full of physical attackers, leave the twister floor mat on, and just run this in the background while I played other games. The game got a bit of a chuckle from me when I first played it, but as the game dragged on it just got more monotonous due to there being no real growth in the game. Everything in the game scales linearly, including mana costs, so it's more about playing keep up with how much health the enemies in later areas have as opposed to actually feeling strong.			"

There are some things I wish were different, like parts of it showing its nature as a port from mobile (where being scummy with in-app purchases and jerking around your players is de rigeur) clearly, but it's basically a parodic JRPG as made by a bunch of Brazilians.

												Appealing idea at first: table-top RPG simulation.Turns out, the game is about grind. There is a story, but it is only about ""move, grind next 10 battles and 1 boss"". All battles could be won using the same tactics, with numerous menu invokes and the same skill rotations. Couldn't finish the game, though grinded with all my force to make it to the end and delete a game.Graphics is bad for my taste. Pixel-art by itself is not a justification for a tasteless.

They are NOT required in any way though for the actual game. They act as time savers allowing you to buy better items and xp potions faster.

												For quite a few hours I really liked this game. Then I ended up with all my party dead and not enough gold to revive more than one. And not enough gold then to take that one to an area in which to earn more gold. Sooo.... heading to the internet I read up on what happened and I saw a lot of confused information about other save systems, a blacksmith that wasn't mentioned in the game from what I could see, and microtransations that may or may not be in the pc version of the game as they were in the ios version for the mobile.Really such a shame as up until then I was loving the game, but seriously not enough to try and start it all over again. It's simple enough in premise, very more-ish when you're playing but unless you know what you are doing before you start, I wouldn't bother. If you do want to play it, definitely read up on it all before you start as you'll  have zero help in game.			"

												At first, I thought this game was great!  However, then it just turned into a grind and the completionist in me forced me to play through and finish it.  Here are the main complaints:-The game progresses pretty smoothly and you don't need to grind much until the last dungeon.  I could get to the last dungeon easily, but then had to do almost 5 levels of grinding with all my guys just to be able to complete the final dungeon.-The blacksmith levels up far too slowly. The only way to level him is to get him grindstones, which you can find 1 to 4 of in certain locations.  However, at the final level you can give him 20-30 grindstones and barely move his xp bar.-Any game that encourages micro-transactions has already failed.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition is an example of what is wrong with the gaming industry, publishers and developers working together to make a game that is less than a full and proper experience without first investing heavily in it.  In most cases, that means you must use real world money to make your game run the way it should in the first place.  Luckily the game gives players a choice, you have the choice to play the game a great deal, or to buy shortcuts to make the game better.  Everywhere you turn there is a price attached to everything, you can gain the currency with playing or with plastic, and playing takes way too long.I would say that the game itself, when you ignore this horrible choice of microtransactions, is mediocre, not exceptional.  It has several novel ideas, but it lacks any real pay off, there is nothing revolutionary or deeply engaging about it.  Even the flavour text, the stuff you would hope would be most entertaining in a dungeons and dragons type of game feels weak and boring, as though the developers were not into it.Overall, I was quite disappointed with this title and I don't think many people will be able to enjoy it.

												This is quite possibly one of the more interesting games I've played in the past couple years and mind you I own 400+ games because it takes the classic Dungeons and Dragons board game and turns it into a sprite game while poking fun at the fact its all essentially imaginary and your characters make some funny comments now and then out of character lol.Overall the its a very well rounded game and I definately can't stop playing it.I'd say the only thing that is a negative point about the game is that to upgrade your gear you need to level up the blacksmith by collecting a literal f'ing s**t ton of an item called a Grindstone which to get them you buy them from the shop(waste of money) or mine them which takes f'ing forever. I found an exploit though that makes it easier to double the amount of grindstones you get. When you start the game to the east of the starting town is a cave where you can mine grindstones. When you click on one and the dice rolls up you need 6 or higher to get the grindstone. The key here is after clicking on the ore deposit just start pressing spacebar because once the dice stops rolling and you do or don't get the grindstone the act of pressing spacebar triggers the dice to reroll giving you another chance to get a grindstone. I went from getting around 10 grindstones every minute to around 20-25 grindstones in the same amount of time.			"

												Great RPG. Instead of races you pick stereotypes/characters and then assign them a class. Each class has four skills. You can have a party of up to five. Everything in the game uses the same currency. It does offer more gold for microtransactions but I think it's pretty well implemented. You don't have to spend a million dollars to get a bunch of gold. It starts as low as 99 cents for 300 gold and the top is $5 for 10,000 gold which is very reasonable I think. The gameplay is turn based fighting with all the strategy you expect. Your tank can tank, your mage can magic, your rogue can stealth etc. I am really diggin this.			"

												This is quite possibly one of the more interesting games I've played in the past couple years and mind you I own 400+ games because it takes the classic Dungeons and Dragons board game and turns it into a sprite game while poking fun at the fact its all essentially imaginary and your characters make some funny comments now and then out of character lol.Overall the its a very well rounded game and I definately can't stop playing it.I'd say the only thing that is a negative point about the game is that to upgrade your gear you need to level up the blacksmith by collecting a literal f'ing s**t ton of an item called a Grindstone which to get them you buy them from the shop(waste of money) or mine them which takes f'ing forever. I found an exploit though that makes it easier to double the amount of grindstones you get. When you start the game to the east of the starting town is a cave where you can mine grindstones. When you click on one and the dice rolls up you need 6 or higher to get the grindstone. The key here is after clicking on the ore deposit just start pressing spacebar because once the dice stops rolling and you do or don't get the grindstone the act of pressing spacebar triggers the dice to reroll giving you another chance to get a grindstone. I went from getting around 10 grindstones every minute to around 20-25 grindstones in the same amount of time.			"

												This little game, a nostalgic blend of retro-console RPG's and old-school D&D, is novel and amusing. I love the interface, with the DM seated on one side of a table and the players (characters) on the other side, and with the scenery changing around them and the ranks of opponents springing up from behind the DM's shoulders. Character development and turn-based combat are simplistic and two-dimensional, but interesting and challenging. However, it all starts to get repetitive and a little monotonous after a half-dozen or so hours of play. If you can get this game on sale for under $5, it's worthwhile. As for the in-game gold that can be bought with real-world money: It's totally unnecessary, and buying some may even spoil the game for you, since it will make the game too easy and reduce the number of enjoyable hours you'll get out of it.

												What a little gem! I found this beauty in the Paradox Humble Bundle (still available at the time of writing so go grab it if you haven't already) and fell in love with it. Not the style of RPG that I've really had much experience with so for me this was a bit of an experiment. I digress, a simple and smooth game that's easy to get into. I found it a little odd that my rogue has an attack almost double that of my warrior but that's pretty much the only issue I've had. Of course there's grinding... and then some more grinding Oh I'm sorry did you think you were done? Guess what!?MORE GRINDINGBut that's what you sign up for with these games, you have to be prepared for it and I have to say, it pays off. The parody of the traditional D&D scenario is wonderful and the humor is very self aware. The references are tasteful and abundant but not overly so that they obscure the story.I would recommend this to anyone lacking the means, friends or who's simply as antisocial as myself to actually play D&D (not a bad thing) to give this a go if you are interested in that sort of thing.

												This game is awesome, well worth the low price, I also recommend the digital deluxe edition. It includes some gold and stuff, but mainly a village thats GREAT for grinding xp in the early parts of the game.Anyway, heres my thoughts:Sound: The soundtrack isn't bad, pretty much what you'd expect in an rpg game, I do occasionally get sick of the looping song. However, the boss music is awesome and intense.Graphics: The graphics rock, It's all pixel art and it looks awesome!Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty simple, but its also fun and at times, hilarious. The basic idea is your a bunch of people playing a game like dungeons and dragons in a basement. You choose your characters race (Pizza guy, jock, nerd etc) and class (cleric warrior paladin mage etc) and start playing. As you level up you will unlock and upgrade your different skills. There are plenty of fun items to find and equip, and I also joy at leveling up. Not only can you  buy ingame items, you can buy furniture, new tables, and snacks and drinks for the basement that your ACTUALLY playing the game in for buffs in the game. Pretty funny if you ask me. The game is very fun to play overall, even though at times, the missions feel a bit similar.Overall I would give this game a 8.7 out of 10.			"

												It's not often that after only an hour of gameplay I don't feel the need to press on. The graphics are cute and the game sounds nice, but the gameplay and story are just not where they need to be. Yeah, the idea of playing a computer RPG about Pen & Paper RPGs is a cute idea, but the game is so damn meta that it actually feels like an amateur effort. Prepare to fight rats, goblins and evil wizards. Yawn. The character creation system looks very detailed at first, but then you realize that of the six initial classes, most only have 3 active skills and one passive skill for the ENTIRE game, and one or two have - gasp - FOUR skills. Here's every encounter in the game: rogue/mage use stuns, paladin use taunt, cleric heal, then attack, attack, attack, attack... Leveling up consists of upgrading one of your four skills, and weapons/armor upgrades require extreme grinding to level up your blacksmith to get a CHANCE at getting a straight upgrade. Oh and what's this? MICROTRANSACTIONS? In a game I already paid for? Even as a casual RPG, I would avoid getting this game at any price point. On a tablet? Maybe. On PC there are just way too many better indie titles at the same price point.			"

												If you've ever been a fan of table-top fantasy games, you need to buy this ASAP.It has a lot of other aspects that would certainly appeal to a lot of other people, but that's what drew me in, and that's what's going to keep me playing.

												Fun concept, bad execution.  The sequel is more recommended.  There are just TONS of better indie RPGs on Steam, that are more stable and more appropriately priced.*Edit - After spending a bit more time with Knights of Pen & Paper 2, I can honestly say that it is a superior product in every way shape and form.  All of the things that were promising and intriguing about the original, just not an awful pile of badly ported mobile garbage.  Skip this game and please go buy the sequel - it's fantastic.Nothing but cons to list here:
Unstable and buggy port, my game was even missing a bunch of the dialogue.Poorly written dialogue, confusing and nonsensical story.Wide array of classes and items, that are almost all entirely useless due to lack of necessity/context in which to use them, and complete inability to level alternative classes once you reach mid or end-game (beyond an incredibly long and boring grind, repeating the same fights over and over for hours on end).End-game is an equally long and boring grind, money is extremely hard to come by, since the original (mobile) version of the game encouraged you to pay cash for gold - The disparity was never fixed when porting to PC.The price is absurd.  The port is so badly done, that there is zero justification for the seven dollar price increase.  The $4.99 DLC is a slap in the face for the amount of content received.  Easily should have been a $2.99 game w/ $0.99 DLC. "

												Firstly I will tell you this game is a mobile port.Second it has a microtransaction of buying ingame gold for cash,but you never  and I mean never need to use it.There are plenty of items ingame that increase the amount of gold you get dropped that have other stats to them.Now to the review.Short Review:Game has classes you can swap in and out,skills that you can level individually,upgradeable class locked weapons/armor and plenty of item accessories and consumables.The game has pop culture reference comedy all throughout it,hardly any variation in quest types and is grindy since you only turn-base fight your way through each situation for the most part.Plenty of boss fights in the game,no puzzles, and a small learning curve on how to handle things. Uses dice roll to determine things such as crafting chance,battles,etc. If you like games you can play 5min-1hr + at a time,do not mind grind , a pop culture heavy comedic story, and little varation in gameplay then pick it up on sale, or in a bundle. I would not pay full price,just does not feel like a $10 game , more like a $2.50-$5 one.Regular Review:The game itself is a comedic sort of table top dice roll turned into a video game.The dialog trees,characters, and the story have comedy all throughout them. The game has tons of pop culture references from 1970s- onward in both enemies,outfits and dialog.Gameplay mechanic wise you pretty much fight turn based fight your way through all the quests you do.There is hardly any variation in the quests escort,item fetch/deliever,rescue, and fight/slay. They incorporate you grind fighting your way through.There are no puzzles or anything so do not expect much outsite of witty dialog and fights.Items in the game are what you would expect, consumables with stat buffs that last for a certain time.Weapons/armor are not sold but are upgraded by blacksmiths.They are only found in towns as well as item purchases.There are different character classes each with 4 skills that you can level up individually.When you decide what character classes you want you have to pick a person whom hs their on special stat they add to be that class.You can swap in and out character classes that you level up when you are at towns with taverns.The game can be played for 5min- 1hr+ depending on how much grinding and story you are willing to play through. There is a NG+ when you beat the game to continue on your adventures which resets all the quests making the mobs tougher at the beginning onward.My final verdict on this game is if you do not mind the grind,it is a enjoyable title.Its simple yet to the point.I played it in spurts and had fun playing it.Its deffinately not for everyone but no game out there is.Get it on sale or in a bundle, not worth $10 to me more like $2.50-$5 game.Not for lack of content,more for lack of variations in quests and gameplay mechanics.

												This game is half/decent game. I haven't played enough of it, only 3.5 hours of the game, from what I know, I got the original version and not the ""digital deluxe"" I reccomend you get this otherwise, you'll have to do about 1 hour of grinding in order to reach it. In 3.5 hours I've created two saves which include characters level 11/12. Its fairly challenging to level up and its meant to give a nostalgic feel to the game which is why the graphics are pixel art. Problem I find, people pay £8 or $15 to only spend more money to get your coins, you dont necessarily have to buy it, I would do it because grinding is repetitive and mind-blowingly boring. People should pay money for games to not have to spend more money. Thats what F2P games are for. Thats how they get their money not games you spend a fair bit on only to spend more. Thats my complaint, Peace. a weak six or a strong five is my score, I feel I wont exceed 25 hours of gameplay on this game. If I do then I'll surprise myself. - 09.03.2014			"

												I wish there was a ""meh"" button between yes and no, but Knights of Pen and Paper is... well, a basic, bare-bones turn-based grindy RPG.  Don't interpret the no vote to mean I think it's a bad game, it's just not that inspiring.  You set up a party, choose which fights you want so as to make sure you don't bite off more than you can chew, and then grind, grind, and grind some more.  Then you curb-stomp a quest boss when you can be bothered.  You have four skills per character, and basically pick one or two to min-max, and use basically exclusively for the entire length of the game.  Since your potential actions are so limited in combat, the differences between one fight and the next are negligible... if you're even fighting different enemies at all, since uneven challenge and reward schedules tend to reward players heavily for fighting the same pack of creatures in droves until you're ready to leapfrog half a dozen levels to the next cash cow.  A special ""rug"" for auto-battling basically means this game becomes something to press ""start"" on, then come back to later to reset another battle.  The only real thing to do outside of battles is to buy things, so there isn't much to break the monotony.Kinghts of Pen and Paper is a decent concept, but it just doesn't engage the player enough for me to give this a good recommendation.

The game was delightful to play, but is not replayable when you lose the various classes and characters you unlock for new parties.  BE Warned! if you decide to go ahead with purchasing the game, if not, it's worth it if it's free.  Be warned too if you plan on buying Knights of Pen and Paper II, same developers, probably get the worst update I have ever encountered again.			"

												I quite liked Knights of Pen and Paper+1. I liked the classes, the gameplay. However In the latest patch the developers accidentally deleted all the saved games. Accidents can happen, and they promised us a ""Master Save"" that ""should appeal to all users that had their save deleted""The Master Save however is somewhat of a joke. No XP potions, Character/class choices that are dubious at best, a rediculously low amount of gold and not nerely enough unlocks. What they really should have given us was a lot of Gold, XP potions and grindstones so we could remake our party as we had before.The first was an honest mistake, the latter was simply insulting.

												It's a charming concept that loses its charm fairly quickly. The humor gets old, and the combat system gets boring and repetitive. The story is pretty bland and its execution is poor, drowned in the midst of required jobber battles that the game throws at you in a mockery of typical poor DMing style. It's got the American Nightmare problem in which it acknowledges why what it's parodying is lame, but doesn't actually do anything to fix it. Something that's ironically bad is still, unfortunately, bad.In all, it feels like a quirky, above-average quickie mobile game that sells itself as an engaging RPG.If you like that sort of thing, then get it when it's on sale. It's not worth $10.			"

												Despite being sprites rather than 3D, this game threatened to overheat my laptop, which I count the first strike against it. It's no good sacrificing graphics quality if you're still going to demand huge amounts of GPU investment. The second strike is that the massive amounts of heat are going to waste doing nothing at high speeds - the game is irritatingly slow at times, and I used CheatEngine to double KPP+1's speed to get it to a tolerable level. In-app purchases are the third strike leading me to conclude: KPP+1 is a bad game. Cute characters, witty humor, and a whole lot of hack'n'slash against evil monsters doesn't make up for poor underlying design.			"

												This game is a wonderful mini-masterpiece that makes you feel as if you're playing a table-top game without the actual table or friends. You can experience D&D-style gameplay without having to break out dice, charts, pencils, and painted figures, and it really makes it much easier to immerse yourself into the game. With the deluxe edition, you get SO many awesome new items and references to play with, including furniture such as THE TARDIS from Doctor Who, 800 gold coins and starting buff items, and even a new player character that makes a powerful magic user! I'd honestly buy the game just for that.So many different players-class combinations to choose from that could either make the game difficult or easy, and it's so much fun to try different combos!I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG games, humor, and gaming/television references!

												As a 25+ year veteran of pen and paper gaming in real life it was hard not to instantly fall in love with this game when I was put on to it for my tablet, when I saw it was on Steam I just had to have it here as well, the Deluxer content is somewhat useful but by no means essential but I'm happy to put the money towards the company in the hopes of continuing the title.The game captured the feel of a well run gaming group with a very tongue in cheek look at the genre and while it is easy to offend such minority interests it is hard to endear, and this game certainly doesn't offend :)The pop culture references date from my childhood to modern day and any nerd/geek will find something in there they relate to from their childhood, very well written and humorous throughout.Game play is easy and as I like to call it, drunk friendly, easy enough to play while intoxicated, engrossing enough not to get dull.In my opinion this is the best game I've played after Skyrim and Fallout 3 and if you know me that is a high recommendation indeed.Behold studios are my 8 bit Bethesda All in all you will not regret buying this game and once you play it you'll be recommending it too.

												I don't know where and when I got this game...But... This game...This game is awesome!I liked the overall parody feel about it while it has a strong and solid work about delivering action and plot in moderation, getting some loud laughs from me here and there. The battle is unforgiving, so you always have to be focused, despite it being turn-based. The difficulty is adjustable in a manner ""How frisky you are today?"", taking on anything between 1 and 7 rats or elite monsters. The open-ended way the characters are presented lets you use your imagination. I do feel like playing a table top sheets'n'pens while playing this. Yes, the feel of every character is an illusion, but it's a very-VERY well made illusion.Another point is the building difficulty: Items give you stats that you barely see. Levels give you damage that you barely see. Hp and Mana regen is earned by tears and sweat dripping down your inner thigh. All this while enemy shamelessly uses lifesteal and applies crazy bleeding stacks. Some battles will be so tight that you will stain your undergarments a bit and still lose because of the enemy randomly preferring your rouge to your fully buffed granny paladin. You will put a sleep on a DoT'ed enemy and lose your healer because of that, and you will spend 4 times the money you earned in that battle to revive your team. You will even spend 2k on upgrading your sword and still get nothing in return because you are a looser and you will have no money to leave the god forsaken town.But... You know... That's what's good about this game... That's what's your adventure is. And you should not just accept it, but have tons of fun while at it!I would like to say thank you to the developers. I've seen a lot of attempts to do what they achieved in this game and i think they did it better than anyone else I've seen so far, including UnEpic and Magicka, the first being too far away and the second being a bit too silly. But this game, oh, this game grabs the bull by his modesty and makes him enjoy it so much that he's ashamed afterwards, but he begs for more.Highly recommend.			"

												This game is a wonderful mini-masterpiece that makes you feel as if you're playing a table-top game without the actual table or friends. You can experience D&D-style gameplay without having to break out dice, charts, pencils, and painted figures, and it really makes it much easier to immerse yourself into the game. With the deluxe edition, you get SO many awesome new items and references to play with, including furniture such as THE TARDIS from Doctor Who, 800 gold coins and starting buff items, and even a new player character that makes a powerful magic user! I'd honestly buy the game just for that.So many different players-class combinations to choose from that could either make the game difficult or easy, and it's so much fun to try different combos!I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG games, humor, and gaming/television references!

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 wasn't really the game I was expecting to go through. I thought it was actually worse than it is, and I'm glad I ended up buying this title and playing through it's 9 hour-ish campaign. The basic premise is, you are a group of friends that are playing the much known fantasy tabletop role-playing game, and your adventures are depicted both through pixelated landscapes/characters and from what the D&D players are actually saying, or actually the dungeon master. Much like in the main idea from the movie Inception, you are playing a game in which the characters are playing a game. So, gameception?KoP&P (Knights of Pen and Paper) is an RPG, and most features you expect from one are available in this title. Leveling up your characters, giving them new items, armor and weapons, upgrading your character's abilities, questing your way through until the very end, or until New Game +, in which your able to replay the whole game, with the same characters, but everything is harder. It didn't really attract me, since the main campaign features a bit of grinding and I didn't want to go through the same. It's useful for completing the achievements, though.Soundtrack fits the theme of KoP&P, but can actually become boring after a few hours of gameplay. Another interesting feature is the abundance of references to tv shows, movies, etc. You eventually find a character named Nabe Gewell, which lives in Steam Island, which I found amusing. The 4th wall is also broken lots of times.In conclusion, do yourself a favor, and purchase KoP&P. It entertained me for a couple hours and I'm sure it will do the same for you. Alas, if you actually don't enjoy D&D's concept, steer in the way of another game. "

												As a 25+ year veteran of pen and paper gaming in real life it was hard not to instantly fall in love with this game when I was put on to it for my tablet, when I saw it was on Steam I just had to have it here as well, the Deluxer content is somewhat useful but by no means essential but I'm happy to put the money towards the company in the hopes of continuing the title.The game captured the feel of a well run gaming group with a very tongue in cheek look at the genre and while it is easy to offend such minority interests it is hard to endear, and this game certainly doesn't offend :)The pop culture references date from my childhood to modern day and any nerd/geek will find something in there they relate to from their childhood, very well written and humorous throughout.Game play is easy and as I like to call it, drunk friendly, easy enough to play while intoxicated, engrossing enough not to get dull.In my opinion this is the best game I've played after Skyrim and Fallout 3 and if you know me that is a high recommendation indeed.Behold studios are my 8 bit Bethesda All in all you will not regret buying this game and once you play it you'll be recommending it too.

												I feel torn about this game.  At first it was interesting in the simplicity and style, yet as the game progresses it feel immensely tedious.  There will be quests where you are required to go from one location to another and have to fight at each step along the way, sometimes up to five or six battles.  Then once you arrive the quest is to slay a number of monsters repeatedly.  The endgame seems almost unfair, requiring a lot of grinding unless you spend a lot of time exploring sidequests.  Based on the price, I think the game has a niche in the category of game where you advance through it periodically while taking a break from other games.  Could improvements be made? Absolutely, but for an indie title with some creative 4th wall shattering, it serves it's place decently.			"

I played for 10h, I had fun for 1 at most...the other 9 were just hope it could get better, but ah well, it did not...I would not recommend this game to anyone.

I can handle slow paced and repetitive games but Knights of Pen and Paper is so slow, so repetitive, and so monotonous that I can't appreciate it even as a background distraction while multitasking. Any game so simple needs to compensate with good story depth, complexity, style, or pacing. This game delivers none of these. "

												First game I've ever bought on Steam where I've not actually gotten what I paid for. Sure sometimes a game will have bugs, and sometimes there may be un-noticed system requirements/limitations which are my fault for missing. But here, it's not even the right product. Advertised as win/mac/linux, but buying the deluxe version, none of that extra content shows up for linux. No response from the publisher/devs on their own steam forum linux-specific discussion. First time I've ever felt truly cheated on Steam.Edit: Dec 12th, 2014WIth the latest update, it seems that at long last 2 1/2 months later, the Deluxe Version finally works under linux. Of course they've still been selling for Linux this whole time instead of taking that off until it was fixed. What miniscule communication there has been in that time was all of poor quality and incorrect. Moreover this actual fix wasn't even described or announced. Still cannot recommend.			"

I have only put in a few hours but for being an old school gamer, this game is what I was hoping it would be, fun and attention grabbing. You start out with 2 characters and you start doing quest, mostly by killing mosters, which you gain XP and coins. With the coins you can unlock more characters, buy equipment, pay for travel, buy additional tables, buy bonuses, etc. If you are bored easy, do not like 8-bit graphics, never played D&D, or do not want to grind out some levels, then this game might not be for you.Pros: -Adjustable screen resolution-Like you are playing a D&D game-ReplayableCons:-Music (8-bit music but mute works great)-Grindy			"

While the jabs at RPG norms are humorous and appreciated, the rest of this game is a shallow time waster that would be more enjoyable on the crapper or in the check out line at a grocery store. Oh yeah, and there are microtransactions, though they aren't invasive. If the meta humor alone is enough for you to part with 10 bucks, go for it.

												(This is a copy-paste of my Google Play review, since I apparently don't ""own"" a license to the app and my review was automatically deleted right after posting it) - I purchased it via the Humble Bundle.This game is a great game!

												Awesome game, very addicting and tons of fun.  I personally love rpg's and dnd especially so I was immediately hooked.  Love the variety of classes and characters to choose, and the combat system is interesting enough to keep my attention.  While I loved the references through out the quests; and while the game isn't short, I did find the story line a little lack luster. I never really understood was happening in the story line after beating the first boss (the evil wizard guy) that it kind of went down hill, but the fun was still consistent...... good amount of replayability too as you will unlock more classes and characters to choose the more you play.

Boring.Knights of Pen & Paper is long, dull, grindy and most of all it is boring.It starts out novel enough. You are playing a game about a bunch of gamers playing D&DA few obvious jokes and references and things start out pretty well.The sound, music, graphics, they all lend themselves pretty well. But the grind, jeez! This is a single player game! Who thought that...Converted mobile app with a cash shop in the mobile version? OooooooooooooooohI don't need to say much more really. As far as converted mobile games go its actually really well ported. But the play time is so artifically padded that you probably will not complete the game. A sequel has been announced and I hope and pray it addresses the flaws this game has or even just does away with the excessive grinding for the inevitable PC port.I know some smartass will reply that this is an RPG and you are supposed to grind but this isn't 1997 anymore. Games like Bravely Default, like Magic Fantasy Battle 4, have come along and said 'listen, there is grinding but we streamlined it or we made it fun.'I stopped caring about the storyline the 8th time I was told to backtrack for excuse reasons. I especially stopped caring when my Lv32 Barbarian, with maxed equipment, wearing 4 +9attack items, still can't one shot a friggen spider! I especially was agitated that a newer version of this game was released that I can't simply upgrade too, or even buy apprently since steam says 'you already own that game' when clearly I don't. Flaws aside the game is enjoyable in short bursts which is fitting given its mobile phone roots. It was ported to the PC and no real effort was made to make it a more PC friendly game. Instead its dull, repetitive and boring.Also the achievement, beat in 365 (game)days, is unachievable it seems. That's always nice for the achievement hunters.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												A lot of salty reviewers saying this isn't D&D dindn't know this was a parody on watching someone play D&D, and it's fun for some reason.

												Get this guys: Single-player Earthbound / Mother style graphics transformed into a board game. You get to choose your events and your own spawned monsters since you take the role as a player and a GM at the same time.The +1 expansions makes the game worth playing. But the Blacksmith is very unforgiving. 40% success rate as a base to upgrade your items. \The control scheme makes it ideal for touch tablet/touch screen users, but if you don't mind moving your mouse around and clicking a lot. GET A BIT OF THAT OSU WORKOUT!... Then you should be fine.I got it on a daily deal for 60% off. It's worth it big time for that.But when it's not on sale and it's 10 dollars? 15 dollars? What... WHATTTTTTTT!?What slightly made me frown were two things: A) Their Android/iPhone App Version costs $2.99. B) There is the option to buy more gold with Microtransactions (convenience, they say.) While the only thing you can buy is currency, it really makes most users very discouraged to buy it. But trust me, it's a lot better to play it at a normal rate. You'll grow to love your characters more.Given that some builds are worth more than others, you'll see that all the passives are worth leveling a lot in the early levels. There are unlockable classes, and loot to gather. The start of the game gets very slow, but hey. This game's a neat RPG to burn your time. While exponentially better for touch users, it's a neat little gem to stumble upon. BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT PRESS THAT ""+"" SIGN ON THE TOP RIGHT CORNER.Play the game for what it is.			"

												Haha, this was such a dumb game, and yet I kept playing.  Why??  I've been trained too well a la Pavlov's Dog by decades of JRPG repetition to blindly chase after stats, gear and rare loot.  Knights has a good premise and the class combinations are pretty fun, but in the end the gameplay was too simple to really care about.  I also think you earn gold at a really slow pace, probably to incentivize IAP.  Ugh, IAP in a paid game... good thing I got it in a bundle.			"

												A lot of people are saying that this game is nothing more than a bad iOS port complete with microtransactions. I'm here to set the record straight: this game is an iOS port and it has microtransactions, but it's far from terrible. If anything, this game is an intimately-crafted love letter to all things nerdy (D&D, sci fi, etc.). The game does have microtransactions but, if you play it right, you don't need to buy anything beyond the game itself. The only other things that I've spent money on are trading cards (which is par for the course on Steam). If you're looking for a decent roleplaying game with hours of replay value then this is the right one for you. If the thought of microtransactions or performing repeated tasks doesn't appeal to you, then you should probably skip this game (and roleplaying games in general).			"

												Everything good about retro RPG video games as well as classic pen and paper like Dungeons & Dragons is mixed into one wonderful experience in the form of Knights of Pen and Paper. In the game, you play as a group of friends, getting together to play Dungeons & Dragons. You're not just picking classes, but picking which ""real life"" person is playing the characters in game. Want grandma to be the paladin on your team? No problem! Think your little brother would be best suited as a stealthy rogue? You can do that too. Although the character creation is as simple as matching an archetype to a class (like Hipster Mage or Pizza Guy Druid), it's pretty fun and gives the game replayability as you want to experiment with different combinations.The storyline is light, but definitely will bring back memories to anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons in their lives. You travel through towns like ""Journey Village"" and battle monsters to save missing kings in a world full of pop culture references. It might be a bit silly if you're looking for a serious RPG, but if you love the classic turn-based battle style of the early Final Fantasy games, you'll at least appreciate the simple awesomeness of the gameplay. It's also hugely accessible and easy to learn for those who've never played that kinda game before.You'll get the most out of this if you're just a huge RPG fan, because Knights of Pen and Paper relies a lot on nostalgia. Still, it's a really fun RPG that can eat up many hours of your life in a very satisfying way. It's a really good example of what indie game companies are capable of. Oh, and if you complain about the graphics, I have a fist to shake at you.			"

												I'm slightly disappointed by this game, but play it anyway.  The mechanics are pretty decent, and I like that it's got a DND type feel to it (not to mention the excellent dialog!) but it really just feels like a cellphone game that was ported over to PC and shoved out the door.  I just feel like they could have done a better job with it.It's slightly too simplistic for my taste, but when I play it, it does scratch a turn based itch that I get from time to time.  Probably not worth full price, but if you see it on sale it might be worth picking up.  Just try and keep your expectations a bit low and you won't be too let down.			"

												A very good RPG/D&D Style game. Pixelated and all. The only thing i have to say i do not like about this game is the in game currency. You can earn gold by Grinding and stuff like that, but they have the ""Purchase gold here"" for actual money, which is quite a disapointment, but besides that, fantastic game, great art, and fun atmosphere. The thing that really suprised me was the detail that you can apply to your room. When i say room, i mean the actual room that you and your friends are playing in, like the pet, door, carpet, book, ect. It lets you have different styles while also increasing atributes like, exp gain, money gain, strength, etc. 8.5/10			"

												It's a game with a great sense of humor and style. It's definitely an homage both to old school video game RPGs as well as old school tabletop RPGs, which is an interesting and fun intersection of interests. The micro-transactions/real money bits of it... kinda suck honestly and it tends to hold the game back in some ways that are annoying, but in general the game is pretty fun, especially considering you can hop on and play for 20-30 minutes and drop right back out again.

												I found that Knights of Pen and Paper was a nice take on the Rpg/Turn-base genre, though it does keep the generic combat classicaly found in the genre it posseses an interesting narrative that can keep a player interested throughout the whole game. The generic aspects aside the game does have a nice twist allowing the player to keep certain bonuses and gold on all save files  which adds greatly to the replay value of the game. ( The game does have a + mode which allows you to restart your adventure  keeping all your characters but making the enemies allot harder )A game I definitely recommend playing for new and veterans to the genre.

												Everything good about retro RPG video games as well as classic pen and paper like Dungeons & Dragons is mixed into one wonderful experience in the form of Knights of Pen and Paper. In the game, you play as a group of friends, getting together to play Dungeons & Dragons. You're not just picking classes, but picking which ""real life"" person is playing the characters in game. Want grandma to be the paladin on your team? No problem! Think your little brother would be best suited as a stealthy rogue? You can do that too. Although the character creation is as simple as matching an archetype to a class (like Hipster Mage or Pizza Guy Druid), it's pretty fun and gives the game replayability as you want to experiment with different combinations.The storyline is light, but definitely will bring back memories to anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons in their lives. You travel through towns like ""Journey Village"" and battle monsters to save missing kings in a world full of pop culture references. It might be a bit silly if you're looking for a serious RPG, but if you love the classic turn-based battle style of the early Final Fantasy games, you'll at least appreciate the simple awesomeness of the gameplay. It's also hugely accessible and easy to learn for those who've never played that kinda game before.You'll get the most out of this if you're just a huge RPG fan, because Knights of Pen and Paper relies a lot on nostalgia. Still, it's a really fun RPG that can eat up many hours of your life in a very satisfying way. It's a really good example of what indie game companies are capable of. Oh, and if you complain about the graphics, I have a fist to shake at you.			"

												KPP+1 seems like an interesting concept, but it's really not. The theme is you actually roleplay players in a roleplaying world as characters.  You get the impression this is going to result in lots of humor and a diversity of environments where the players goof around in-character, but it doesn't happen.  Instead, you just end up picking a party of characters, optimize their performance with player personalities, buy add-ons for your gameroom that give character bonuses such as a better table or door, and meander through a roleplaying world which has little plot in itself nevermind the lack of out-of-character plot among the players.  There isn't THAT much grinding if you do all the quests and use your items and gameroom bonuses appropriately to multiply the amount of experience and gold you get from battles, but you still have to complete slayer quests which are like how in MMOs you have to kill so many monsters for a reward.  The battle system is rather repetitive too.  Basically, you just get a taunting tank, heal it, and disable opponents while bombarding them with a magic dps and melee dps.  This goes on over and over with no change in tactics.  I say this despite how you can ""choose the difficulty"" by picking how many monsters you want to fight.  It's either you pick too little monsters to bother, pick just enough to repeat over and over, or pick too many to handle.  On the plus side, you can grab revive items in the shop in case your party dies out rather than paying the revive cost if you pick too many to handle, but it still doesn't make up for the repetition.  This is compounded by the ridiculous investment needed to level up the blacksmith by buying ""grindstones"".  Each one costs 25 coins, yet the optimal levels of upgrading require around 100 grindstones.  Basically, that means you have to earn 6-7k coins, and when you're earning around 50-100 coins per fight until about 75% of the way through the game where you start earning 250-300 coins per fight, that means you're not going to experience using the blacksmith for a very long time.  You also need to buy enough luck amulets and great molten rings to make the optimal level cost effective, and you have to buy gameroom items to accelerate your income, so that's another 2-3k.  This ignores how you're spending coins on other things, so it really takes a long time just to unlock better equipment for your party.The campaign ultimately feels like a tutorial sampler of what the game has to offer.  Had the game included a custom campaign editor, this would be awesome since players could make their own material and share it in the community.  Heck, the campaign even feels like it'll unlock this towards the end in saying how the gameworld is much bigger than what you can see, but it never gets unlocked.  Also, the new classes you unlock are mostly pointless.  They're effective, but you have to level them up instead of being able to introduce them into the game right away, and that's a huge timesink.  Even if you play ""New Game+"" you still have to level them up.  This really stinks since it'd be nice to immediately jump into using a barbarian, knight, shaman, bard, and necromancer instead of a warrior, cleric, druid, mage, and rogue.  The game however just says, ""NO.  YOU DO HARD WAY OR NOT AT ALL!  GRRR!""On the other hand, if you start a plain old new game for the party, then you have to go through the hassle of upgrading the blacksmith all over again!  Don't forget the great molten rings or luck amulets too!  To be fair, you don't have to buy the income earning gameroom upgrades again, and you can technically grind out the income with your previous party in your other game since coins pool from all saved games, but still, you're talking about a good 8-9k in coins just to upgrade the blacksmith again. At that rate, you might as well just buy experience potions for 100 coins a pop to give everyone 6500 experience, plus you can buy the potion upgrades in the game room and use Ronaldo for the potion upgrade......but still, it's just more repetition.  This is supposed to be a roleplaying game instead of a railroad shooter.If the devs just spend a little more time on writing a plot, this game could have been awesome, but they didn't, so it flopped.

												KoPP is modeled after D&D gameplay. You play as a group of roleplayers sitting around a table, going on an adventure led by a dungeon master. No, really. The DM is actually there, narrating the quest. It’s a really unique RPG in its presentation, though not so much in its gameplay, which is a rather simple turn-based battle system.The simplicity owes to the game's origins on mobile platforms, and this is why recommending KoPP is complicated for me: It still plays exactly like a mobile game, much better suited for playing in small intervals. Understandably, a lot of people don't expect that from a $10 PC game. If it was the same price as the mobile version ($3), maybe it could get away with its lack of depth. Not for this price.It's also worth noting that there are microtransactions in the game. [Update: Not anymore. As of patch 2.09 (2014/02/14), they have been removed from the game.]. Also, some achievements are broken, and won't be fixed for a while. [Update: Also fixed in patch 2.09, I was able to obtain all of them.]You may be wondering why I recommend the game after all. Very simple. I still enjoyed it. I'd play it while watching a stream or something, when I wanted to unwind and avoid ultra-complex games. In a way, I went through it with the mobile mindset, and this is the case in which I'd recommend KoPP, if you want a simple game.Just don't get it for full price, even if you really want it. It's not worth it. Wait for a sale of at least 50% off.			"

												So this is a money game where you can pay IRL dollars for in-game gold, and like most games that follow this model, the game is annoying if you try to play it without spending real money on in-game currency. Even if that doesn't bother you, the game is long and repetitive and riddled with lame pop culture references. The idea of a digital RPG that mimics a tabletop RPG is cool, but I recommend avoiding this one.			"

												This is an example of how games of old should be made anew.Everything is fully customizable, from the role of each class you pick to your next quest;The gameplay is solid, comparable to classic JRPGs like Phantasy Star II and Dragon Quest V,But with a ""do what you want, when you want, the way you think you can handle"" touch.The graphics are reminiscent of Kairosoft's cellphone games (Game Dev Story), and look very good.Highly recommended!

												A very good RPG/D&D Style game. Pixelated and all. The only thing i have to say i do not like about this game is the in game currency. You can earn gold by Grinding and stuff like that, but they have the ""Purchase gold here"" for actual money, which is quite a disapointment, but besides that, fantastic game, great art, and fun atmosphere. The thing that really suprised me was the detail that you can apply to your room. When i say room, i mean the actual room that you and your friends are playing in, like the pet, door, carpet, book, ect. It lets you have different styles while also increasing atributes like, exp gain, money gain, strength, etc. 8.5/10			"

												(this review mainly looks at microtransactions)I initially was really excited about this game, as I find the premise and art style quite appealing. The problem lies, as many reviewers prior to me noticed, within built-in microtransactions. Ability to bypass the grind paying for in-game currency ruins any kind of trust in the economy at all. Some people might be OK with this, but I do have a couple points of contention: - The financial aspect introduces a bias from the point of developer, conscious or otherwise, to balance a game in a way that will push a player to use microtransactions. From that point on, hitting a wall, you can never possibly know either you are bad at game or the game is rigged. - Basically what a player pays for is something that earlier would've been archived by using CheatEngine or similar software. I want to stress that my point here is not ""paying for something that could be free"", but rather introducing the idea of cheating from the get-go. On top of that paying to not play game is plain weird to me. A bonus point - Steam page for the game doesn't have any mention of in-app purchases (aside from user reviews). With those points in mind, the choice comes down to whether you are willing to invest time into something that shouldn't be trusted by design.			"

Looks like it has a lot of things to keep me busy playing and looks like chances to goof around and try other things for laughs. However, my only gripe with the game so far is there isn't much classes or kinds of players to pick from. Yet, I'm really looking forward to playing more of this game when I get the chance. This is a very simple load up and play game. Totally recommended if you enjoy D&D. Worth the $2.49 I spent on this game, easily!			"

												This game has a lot of charm and I enjoyed my two play-throughs. However it boils down to very shallow RPG that's comparable to some of the original GameBoy's launch titles. You select a premade character, there's no way to customize their look but you do get to distribute points to their character sheets. Each of the 10 classes only has 4 abilities, and that is counting their passives. Damage is either magical or physical, no breakdowns within such as fire, slashing, holy, etc.  You'll quickly find others to join your party and unlock new classes to choose from.An interesting feature is that when a battle starts you choose what type of enemies appear and how many there are, you're the dungeon master as well as the player. You'll probably want to have a tank in your party to taunt, and at least one area of effect damage dealer, along with a healer, and maybe a single target damager to mop up the rough edges and elites. Extremely basic tactics here.The unlockables were nice (they were previously microtransactions but changed in this mobile to Steam port to be bought only with in game gold), but they make the game far too easy. Even with the cheats off don't expect a challege here. But you'll probably get some laughs and have fun, especially if you've ever put hours into any RPG. This one won't try to keep you for long and it's cheap.			"

												Tabletop rping gone meta. This game is chock full of little gags, from visual ones in the background to quotes and characters. The gameplay itself is solid and is a lot of fun. There are times where you do have to grind but that's standard issue for an rpg and if you dislike that then there are very few rpg's I would or could recommend.I have no issues with this game... With one exception, the in game microtransactions. You can avoid them quite easily, but it irks me that it is still included in a game I had to pay for in the first place. Either be free and have microtransactions or paid and not have them not paid and have them, that's just underhanded. That being said it's actually really easy to get around. If your main team dies just create a new one and any coins they earn will be shared between the different playthroughs. There's also a new game + mode but it doesn't really add anything except the monsters being more difficult.I would highly recommend this game but I would also wait for it to appear in a steam sale.

												KPP+1 seems like an interesting concept, but it's really not. The theme is you actually roleplay players in a roleplaying world as characters.  You get the impression this is going to result in lots of humor and a diversity of environments where the players goof around in-character, but it doesn't happen.  Instead, you just end up picking a party of characters, optimize their performance with player personalities, buy add-ons for your gameroom that give character bonuses such as a better table or door, and meander through a roleplaying world which has little plot in itself nevermind the lack of out-of-character plot among the players.  There isn't THAT much grinding if you do all the quests and use your items and gameroom bonuses appropriately to multiply the amount of experience and gold you get from battles, but you still have to complete slayer quests which are like how in MMOs you have to kill so many monsters for a reward.  The battle system is rather repetitive too.  Basically, you just get a taunting tank, heal it, and disable opponents while bombarding them with a magic dps and melee dps.  This goes on over and over with no change in tactics.  I say this despite how you can ""choose the difficulty"" by picking how many monsters you want to fight.  It's either you pick too little monsters to bother, pick just enough to repeat over and over, or pick too many to handle.  On the plus side, you can grab revive items in the shop in case your party dies out rather than paying the revive cost if you pick too many to handle, but it still doesn't make up for the repetition.  This is compounded by the ridiculous investment needed to level up the blacksmith by buying ""grindstones"".  Each one costs 25 coins, yet the optimal levels of upgrading require around 100 grindstones.  Basically, that means you have to earn 6-7k coins, and when you're earning around 50-100 coins per fight until about 75% of the way through the game where you start earning 250-300 coins per fight, that means you're not going to experience using the blacksmith for a very long time.  You also need to buy enough luck amulets and great molten rings to make the optimal level cost effective, and you have to buy gameroom items to accelerate your income, so that's another 2-3k.  This ignores how you're spending coins on other things, so it really takes a long time just to unlock better equipment for your party.The campaign ultimately feels like a tutorial sampler of what the game has to offer.  Had the game included a custom campaign editor, this would be awesome since players could make their own material and share it in the community.  Heck, the campaign even feels like it'll unlock this towards the end in saying how the gameworld is much bigger than what you can see, but it never gets unlocked.  Also, the new classes you unlock are mostly pointless.  They're effective, but you have to level them up instead of being able to introduce them into the game right away, and that's a huge timesink.  Even if you play ""New Game+"" you still have to level them up.  This really stinks since it'd be nice to immediately jump into using a barbarian, knight, shaman, bard, and necromancer instead of a warrior, cleric, druid, mage, and rogue.  The game however just says, ""NO.  YOU DO HARD WAY OR NOT AT ALL!  GRRR!""On the other hand, if you start a plain old new game for the party, then you have to go through the hassle of upgrading the blacksmith all over again!  Don't forget the great molten rings or luck amulets too!  To be fair, you don't have to buy the income earning gameroom upgrades again, and you can technically grind out the income with your previous party in your other game since coins pool from all saved games, but still, you're talking about a good 8-9k in coins just to upgrade the blacksmith again. At that rate, you might as well just buy experience potions for 100 coins a pop to give everyone 6500 experience, plus you can buy the potion upgrades in the game room and use Ronaldo for the potion upgrade......but still, it's just more repetition.  This is supposed to be a roleplaying game instead of a railroad shooter.If the devs just spend a little more time on writing a plot, this game could have been awesome, but they didn't, so it flopped.

												So this is a money game where you can pay IRL dollars for in-game gold, and like most games that follow this model, the game is annoying if you try to play it without spending real money on in-game currency. Even if that doesn't bother you, the game is long and repetitive and riddled with lame pop culture references. The idea of a digital RPG that mimics a tabletop RPG is cool, but I recommend avoiding this one.			"

												This game has a lot of charm and I enjoyed my two play-throughs. However it boils down to very shallow RPG that's comparable to some of the original GameBoy's launch titles. You select a premade character, there's no way to customize their look but you do get to distribute points to their character sheets. Each of the 10 classes only has 4 abilities, and that is counting their passives. Damage is either magical or physical, no breakdowns within such as fire, slashing, holy, etc.  You'll quickly find others to join your party and unlock new classes to choose from.An interesting feature is that when a battle starts you choose what type of enemies appear and how many there are, you're the dungeon master as well as the player. You'll probably want to have a tank in your party to taunt, and at least one area of effect damage dealer, along with a healer, and maybe a single target damager to mop up the rough edges and elites. Extremely basic tactics here.The unlockables were nice (they were previously microtransactions but changed in this mobile to Steam port to be bought only with in game gold), but they make the game far too easy. Even with the cheats off don't expect a challege here. But you'll probably get some laughs and have fun, especially if you've ever put hours into any RPG. This one won't try to keep you for long and it's cheap.			"

												A lot of people are saying that this game is nothing more than a bad iOS port complete with microtransactions. I'm here to set the record straight: this game is an iOS port and it has microtransactions, but it's far from terrible. If anything, this game is an intimately-crafted love letter to all things nerdy (D&D, sci fi, etc.). The game does have microtransactions but, if you play it right, you don't need to buy anything beyond the game itself. The only other things that I've spent money on are trading cards (which is par for the course on Steam). If you're looking for a decent roleplaying game with hours of replay value then this is the right one for you. If the thought of microtransactions or performing repeated tasks doesn't appeal to you, then you should probably skip this game (and roleplaying games in general).			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 brings back memories of poorly lit basements and sitting on steel folding chairs next to a double set of card tables. Cans of Mountain Dew strewn about the floor from exciting fights and pulling out the natural 20 when you needed it. KPP+1 contains all the tabletop RPG elements with a highly customizable experience. You can select from several people for your PCs, You can unlock more people within the game as well as unlock more classes to play after completing adventure paths. The feature of the game that keeps me playing is the location changes. You start by sitting in a basement. Starting the game changes the surroundings and you are transported to a town, field, or cave! The culture references are plentiful and will make any geek giggle and say ""No Way!"" a few times. I've counted over 20 references so far and I'm pretty sure I haven't found them all. A few people seem upset about the microstransactions. That is completely optional. You can earn gold in the game. It will take you a while longer, but buying gold isn't required. I'd buy this game for any geek I know, probably even the deluxe edition for those I know who would appreciate it.			"

I believe it is possible to go through the game without doing a lot of grinding for levels.The only downside to this game is you don't quite have has much control of the character stats as I'd like, and there aren't many skills to utilize.

												The idea is BRILLIANT in my opinion! Here is a game clearly dedicated to pen and paper RP-ers, and the meta-feel of it all is excellent. The execution, however, is not up to par. The game begins well, with quips to geek culture all over the place. However, it quickly devolves into a ""hit monsters, get XP"" run of the mill game. The RP component is not there, they fail to pull jokes consistently and you get an old-school hack-and-slash RPG with a meta LOOK. The game caught my interest in the beginning, yet ended up being too boring to complete.			"

If your into RPGs and tabletop gaming youll enjoy the combat ,options and story this game has to offer.Although some ppl have complained that it is to much of a grind i found that pushing though the story made the game reasonable difficult and well paced. Although the replay value is weak there is the option of using the different and new classes and items to get some replay value but dont expect to be playing through half a dozen times. The story is amusing and quirky with alot of pop and nerd culture references littered through out spicing it up and providing alot of humour to keep you going.

I guess one of the big things about this game is that you can have so much fun with it even if you play on a 2003 toaster.

												I really have been enjoying the quality of this game. The gameplay is pretty straightforward like a normal RPG, but being able to add so many new classes and switching it up was appreciated. I also really enjoy the humor of this game and its locations. It seems like a silly idea, being in control of your people and their classes, but its pretty simple and enjoyable. Plus theres so many extra things to collect to enhance your game, I'm nowhere near done and I'm still excited to keep going.			"

												I love this game, it's witty, can be fun if you enjoy the grind, is fun once you've bought enough boosting items. This game has a lot of 80's kid focused humor.It's loaded with great nostalgia/references and beautifully done pixel art, the sound is great though you will likely turn the music off after 3-5 hours of playing.You can have several parties going at once and share earned gold across parties which can make for interesting progression styles. There are permenant upgrades to your table and the room you're playing from that really change the way the game is played and I felt that was a very nice touch.The DEV team was bought out so there's no real support for the game anymore, it has some odd bugs in it still and can occasionally break if you do some things too quickly.Overall 100%ing this game was fun and a steady challenge it took me just under 30 hours.I have a difficult time recommending this game though since it's not really something that just anyone can pick up and play. This game can be frustratingly difficult at times. Especially if your party composition is unable to overcome an obstacle, you may have to start a new game to support your main party.But I've decided to recommend it due to the 8bit charm it has throughout the game which is really entertaining.

												 After seeing a gameplay video on this game i had to give it a try and it delivers. If your into RPGs and tabletop gaming youll enjoy the combat ,options and story this game has to offer.Although some ppl have complained that it is to much of a grind i found that pushing though the story made the game reasonable difficult and well paced. Although the replay value is weak there is the option of using the different and new classes and items to get some replay value but dont expect to be playing through half a dozen times. The story is amusing and quirky with alot of pop and nerd culture references littered through out spicing it up and providing alot of humour to keep you going. I think it was well worth the money i paid and was one of the funnest games ive played this year.			"

												I love this game.  Everything about it has an old-school feel that blends tabletop RPGs with NES graphics.  There is a lot of grinding in this game, but that's what RPGs are about.  You choose your initial characters from an assortment of people who each have their own unique bonuses, then pick a class for them based on those bonuses and what you want in your party.  If you make challenging enough fights, they require a bit of strategy.  My paladin typically casts a shield to reduce damage by 50%, then increases his threat to draw attention, while my rogue stuns people for 3 turns (thanks to items I have that extend the time by 2 turns).  My mage will either AoE the entire group or fireball for a burning DoT.  My cleric has a powerful single heal, decent group heal, an offensive move called smite, and a debuff on 3 enemy's attack strength.  My newest addition, the berserker, goes berserk (I can't choose his targets but he gains extra damage and regen) and has passives/equipment that boost his crit rate above 30% while also allowing him to heal for 63% of his total damage.  And those are just my 5 classes, there's quite a few more to unlock as you play.The grinding part comes in two forms.  You'll find yourself moving back and forth to caves often to get grindstones to upgrade your blacksmith.  You'll also want to fight a lot, and grind quests to earn gold.  Gold can be spent buying yourself some equipment at the blacksmith, or on a whole bunch of upgrades to the room you play in, the table you play on, etc.  Purchases made will give your party bonuses, such as higher RNG die rolls, more gold/exp, boosted stats, regen, etc.There's always something to do in this game.  It can be tedious at times, but the humor of the game, including comments from the game master and party members help to ease this.  Overall, I think it would be a worthy addition to anyone's library who is a fan of old school RPGs.			"

												This is a clever cross platform RPG that plays like a tabletop without the roleplay. The Good  - This is a really fun game with a lot of backstory.  - There is a lot of freedom to do what you want/need to do.   - There is a ton of replayability because of the large amount of character options.   - Go anywhere you can afford. Grinding isn't the main thrust of the game.The Bad  - It's an RPG you will be grinding in some cases.   - Once you get a rhythm down it can get repetetive.  Overall this was a surprisingly fun game. I was expecting something cute and shallow, but the sheer amount of stuff there is to do makes this a truly fun game with a nice story.			"

												The idea is BRILLIANT in my opinion! Here is a game clearly dedicated to pen and paper RP-ers, and the meta-feel of it all is excellent. The execution, however, is not up to par. The game begins well, with quips to geek culture all over the place. However, it quickly devolves into a ""hit monsters, get XP"" run of the mill game. The RP component is not there, they fail to pull jokes consistently and you get an old-school hack-and-slash RPG with a meta LOOK. The game caught my interest in the beginning, yet ended up being too boring to complete.			"

												This game is perfect for when I want something fun to distract me from real-life without having to put too much effort into it.  Basically you're controlling a tabletop group of people - DM included.  It's relaxing and turn-based - no button mashing required.  I love the dialog among the different characters you can play.  There are a lot of pop culture references and just enough crude humor to make it entertaining.  There are all sorts of upgrades you can buy with gold to decorate the room the group is playing in (rugs, doors, items for the table like loaded dice and books)  that give bonuses to your characters.  There's a lot of customization for the characters as well.  I got this on sale for $2, but I'd say it's worth the full price.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time.			"

												Dissapointing in many ways. The game is very adamant about breaking the 4th wall. This started being somewhat endearing but after an hour or so the overly obvious refrences in the lazily made backgrounds, really hurt the game. You're left not really caring about your characters or the world, as the game constantly states that it is just made up. Town have names like default, desert, forest... The game lacks inspiration and drive to be worth your time. Dont get this game unless its on sale or you want to see how which direction not to go with your retro game.			"

												So I just bought this game and I've only few hours in it but I LOVE IT SO MUCH. Where to start? I guess one of the big things about this game is that you can have so much fun with it even if you play on a 2003 toaster. The soundtrack is enjoyable and immersive with MANY different tunes for creepy caves, happy villages and dangerous roads etc. The turn based gameplay is easy to get a grip of and you'll be having fun within minutes. Hilarious character choices. Oh and the game is often funny as hell. Cheek and banter flies across the game table while your party roams the land. Definitely recommend.

												Look... if you have this game, was most likely part of a bundle. But I wouldn't have bought it otherwise. The game was supposed to be retro and amusing but turned into a horrible grind. A really *grindy* grind. It was cute for a while but then quickly got annoying... and the pop-culture references have been done to death.The quests often were ""Kill 7 of X then come back"" or ""Collect 7-12 drops from Y then come back"" and there were a few examples where you had do it that 4 times in a row. You have to pay gold to walk between locations, so it feels like you're questing on a Monopoly board; ""Go south 2, kill 7, come back"" or ""Escort 5 spaces East, get attacked every step, come back"" while you are paying each way. Dumb.The little dungeon system... is annoying. You can't rest or run away from a fight or it boots you out and you have to do the whole dungeon again. You have to wander around to find the key for the boss fight, taking damage from fights or traps 75% of the time. Who does that? Who is going to spend time to do 10-50 of those for the achievement? Pass. Just pass.			"

												FIRST OF ALL: the last update deleted my savegame file, so I would recommend to everyone: make backups of your saves, because the updates can reset them. Or turn off the updates for this game only.This game is fun, has a nice gameplay, unlockable cool characters, lot of achievements, and you need work with your team and use the most useful tables, decorations for you. I was on the end of the game almost, but the update just deleted my save files, so I've got one from the forum, which almost the same like mine was. There are a lot of main and sidequests, you need to upgrade the blacksmith to increase your armor and weapon stats, you can use accessories to get bonuses on your characters and you can switch to another ones and create new ones anytime within the game.About the serial number, you'll get: You can redeem it on the official Paradox forum, and CAN'T use it in-game as a promo code.The only wrong thing about this game is the update system, but the game itself is really fun and enjoyable. :)			"

												this game isn't good but at the same time it's not bad. If you can handle the grinding for the levels then it actually is good. My main complaint is just really the grinding. The game is good with a good amount of classes to choose from. You can unlock 5 (i think 5) by completing quest in the game. The quest can get annoying since sometimes it might be just fight this and hope this drops. i would give this a 6.5/10 If the game is on sale i would defintily get it then.			"

												FIRST OF ALL: the last update deleted my savegame file, so I would recommend to everyone: make backups of your saves, because the updates can reset them. Or turn off the updates for this game only.This game is fun, has a nice gameplay, unlockable cool characters, lot of achievements, and you need work with your team and use the most useful tables, decorations for you. I was on the end of the game almost, but the update just deleted my save files, so I've got one from the forum, which almost the same like mine was. There are a lot of main and sidequests, you need to upgrade the blacksmith to increase your armor and weapon stats, you can use accessories to get bonuses on your characters and you can switch to another ones and create new ones anytime within the game.About the serial number, you'll get: You can redeem it on the official Paradox forum, and CAN'T use it in-game as a promo code.The only wrong thing about this game is the update system, but the game itself is really fun and enjoyable. :)			"

												Had a blast going through this gem for the last few days.  The classes are fairly 'niche' with the usual tropes, a warrior, a priest, a mage, ext.  More classes can be unlocked from differing quest chains.  It feels like a way to waste the week away 20 years ago on a summer vacation.  Not a care in the world and just getting absorbed into an old 8-bit recreation.Solid mix of quests/content, silly dialogues, available classes, and itemization/customization is in it.  After finishing it, I'm now looking forward to A DLC or a +2 edition.  More classes with more growth/interactivity, larger map world / feel, I'd love to be able to quest further or in another story to see have the characters will have to adapt.			"

												It was fun for like 2-3 hours, then becomes very repetitive.This game did very well at mimicking the tabletop RPG feeling. With the pixel art style and humors in story it brings you back to 80's when you sit with friends and roll some dice. Gameplay is quite casual and easy to pick up when you've got some time to kill.You can create a 5 members party, every member only have 4 skills, (some of them are passive skills) and there's no positioning. So there's really not much space for tactics, you'd probably be using the same way against all types of enemies. You can create a new member and exchange someone in your party to have some variety. But trying to level  up that guy is another long way to go. There are only limited amount of quests to do, after completing them all you can do is battle with some EXP/gold efficient monsters again and again.I stopped playing when find myself stuck at a boss and have to farm some money. To me, Knights of Pen and Paper = RPG in a nutshell. It shows me what I like and dislike in RPGs, without having all those fancy graphics, cut scenes, complex battle systems, large amounts of items. And I actually like this style, if you let me pick a game to play between Knights of Pen and Paper and Final Fantasy INSERT YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER, I'd probably still choose this one.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is what I'd call a sufficiently flawed dungeon-crawler.  While the game does allow for a lot of ""customization"", the upgrade system feels wholly dissapointing.  Upgrades/level-ups are barely even noticable, being slight precentage upgrades that almost always mean next to nothing; The variation of the classes is really where the enjoyment of the customization is.  In addition to the lackluster upgrade system, the entire game is grind-ey as all hell.  Want to upgrade your armor? be prepared to either walk back-and-forth between town and cave for a couple hours; that or pay through the nose with your hard-earned gold.  The humor/references are cute at times, but get old very fast... with neither making up for the repetitive gameplay.			"

												It's JRPG with Pen-And-Paper feel to it, with many character classes and some customization options.Game has nice chiptune soundtrack. Gameplay is solid and funny, dialogues and overall plot are nice and have some cute references to the geek culture. Art is very very nice too.+1 Edition has an addition to the main plot like it was made in Fable: The Lost Chapters. Just a couple of extra quests which take place in extra locations. Nothing special.I have completed this game in a couple of days and I liked it. It has some replay value due to many possible character combinations , but I didn't bother with replaying it. Maybe sometime in the future. P.S. Do not mind the microtransaction system so many people are raging about. It's just a little gimmick, not a Pay2Win feature. You can comfortably play without it and still do not insanely grind mobs so you can buy some crucial stuff. No, you can complete the game without any payments and without breaking a sweat (as I did).My score: 8/10.			"

												A fun and highly addictive little game, I certainly had a lot of fun from it. I mostly went for it as I rarely find any games that are Turn-Based, but it is filled with that same kind of humour from hilarious Gamer's movies like Hands of Fate and so on, however there is a lot of Free-To-Play elements that'll make you want to spend money for gold coins, which you can aquire in game, but much slower.

												I do have the game but i never actually bothered myself on playin it for some reason.But from what i´ve seen from alot of gameplays, the game is really good, despite the hate comments i see below.This game was made for people who used to play board games such as Dungeons and Dragons among others (that i seem to have forgotten) back wen there was no computers.Of course people from this generation will hate it, they got no taste in videogames anymore, for them its all about graphics, guns, sex and drugs.I am from this generation though, although somehow i like these retro/indie games (dont ask why).So, i do recommend this game to anyone (especially to old gamers) , and if you grew playing Turn Based Fantasy RPG games such as Final Fantasy, Chrono Cross. Phantasy Star etc etc and i know there are alot here on steam, then buy it, it will be worth it and money well spent.			"

												Interesting idea: you play as pen-and-paper roleplayers, using every stereotype a bad GM can throw at you: cringeworthy story, funny-sounding remarks and lots of combat. If this sounds bad, you either have not played a pen-and-paper RPG, or you were lucky enough to have exceptional GMs. :)If the game could be completed in 5-8 hours, I would recommend it as great and funny satire. However, it is very padded out: at 14 hours, I was close to finish it (I guess), but should have to level up characters or grind for more equipment, and I said, enough is enough.			"

												Really bad port. You can't use the keyboard. It is all just clicking. Nothing is different from the mobile version. It is the same exact game. You are not getting anything more in the PC version. Even the quests are the same. I'd really recommend the mobile version to play on the go, the PC version has nothing more to offer. It's like bringing Angry Birds to PC, it's just the same game, it's not worth more.Now if they expanded on the game and made it more PC friendly, able to use a keyboard, and made the UI fit better on the screen, it would have been a great game. But it's not. The only difference is that you click instead of touch.Now I like the game on mobile, but this is just a bad PC port. It's still a good RPG overall though, I really like it.			"

												This is basically a Western take on the JRPG formula with everything that makes a JRPG worth playing carefully removed. Your characters are blank slates, the cut scenes are static character portraits, the story is nerd ""humor"" (Nabe Gewell needs his Magic Crowbar LOLOLOLOLOL!!!1111), there are no locations to explore, the battle system is incredibly tedious and the central design philosophy of the game is based around mindless grinding.

												You play a small group of players in a D&D tabletop adventure controlled by a DM. Camera is angled from behind the players and the events take place in the backgroud. Mechanics are solid enough and the game is presented very well. has a clever idea and good dialogue.However this game is a port from a mobile format and has all the grind and micotransactions you would expect from the platform at a 10/15euro asking price. Gameplay boils down to farming easy monsters for gold (which could be purchased for real world money instead) Gameplay gets dull and repetitive.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is quirky, it's enjoyable, and charming, but what's really down there is a game that's downright infuriating. The actual concept of a fun D&D like experience of Knights of Pen and Paper sounds fun and gives it a nice charm to it, but it's simply put down by extremely simple and boring battle mechanics, proceding to follow by annoying dice rolls that become much more of an annoyance then an actual Tabletop game, extreme grinding to the point of just annoyance, and the fact that this game isn't simply something to play a long session on just doesn't give it a justifiable pricetag that's way too expensive for it's own good. It works as a fun mobile game, and I really love the charm and such, but it's still isn't enough to warrant such a purchase of 10 dollars.I don't know, maybe I am judging it a bit too much, after all, it's roots were from a mobile game. I wouldn't recommend playing this game to many people (Particularly those who don't like mobile games and their microtransaction-like models), but if you like something that can be played in short bursts, is quirky, and simple, this game is for you.

												Getting to 100% was a bit of a grind but no real challenge.Some achievements require massive ammounts of grinding.Most achievements are gained easily by knowing what quests you need to do.If I remmember correctly the DLC is not required to get all the achivementsThere is a thing as TOO many refferences and the gameplay gets old really fast.

												This is one of those games you might give a quick look and pass on, but you'd be making a grave mistake!If you're into oldschool style turn-based RPGs, pick up KoPP+1.  It's a ton of fun and completely playable in both short doses and long sessions, with a decent story that pokes a lot of fun at the entire table-top RPG genre and many other pop icons.  I purchased it on a whim and quickly fell in love with the quaint graphics, the quirky story, and the RPG style character/equipment progression. With the amount of time I've sunk into the game (replaying and achievement hunting), I'm forced to give the game a 9/10 rating and highly recommend it!  I wish there were more games like it!			"

												This game ate up an entire Tuesday and Wednesday for me.Seriously.  I haven't even moved.  Just sat here, playing.It's sad that some achievements are bugged and can't be gotten, otherwise I'd have 100%'d this gem.  There's micro transactions in the game but they're totally optional.  I completed the game without spending any more money on the game than the pennies I bought it for.If you like pen and paper RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, you might enjoy this tribute.  Many gaming easter eggs, some laughs, fun storyline.  Replayability? Hm.. I don't know, probably not much.  I think you'd finish it twice but that's about it.If this comes on sale, give it a go, I bought it for £4 and was highly worth it.			"

												The first half of this game is awesome. Once you hit roughly level 15 the sidequests are absent. If your going to play this title it's not too bad, to make the experience better, spend some cash on the XP potions especially at lower levels.Once you finish the level 15 main quest the next main quest level jumps to 21. I might finish this title one day, I really don't want to grind 6 levels especially when the xp requirements are so high at that point.I'm going to have to give Knight of Pen and Paper a thumbs down. I'm certainly not saying this is a terrible game though and many people will probably love it.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. I also have it on my phone from Humble Bundle. I play it on the bus and on my PC when i get home. It's a fun little game to pass the time. I like the fact you can create your own team of players and customize the room you play in. The fun little quotes they have are pretty cool. The only thing i would like to change is that the Dungeon Master should pick which creatures you face, instead of the player choosing which and how many creatures to face. But overall I really do enjoy playing this game.			"

												Grab this game on sale while you can. Absolutely great bang for the buck at 3.39 for normal and 5.09 for the deluxe. It's very simple, yet very addicting. It has such basic things that I love about the older RPG games: No preset characters whos backstory is always the same or the same class. You simply pick what classes you want and jump right into it - think final fantasy 1. It's got a goofy spin on it that I like: You are always playing from the game table even when fighting and can buy furniture, snacks, etc. for bonuses. You won't regret buying this game. ESPECIALLY on sale. GET IT NOW!			"

												If you have EVER played a tabletop RPG (Dungeons and Dragons, GURPS, anything by White Wolf; or for that matter, anything where dice, paper and your imagination are required) you will be familiar with how this game operates.  Folks are around the table, One leads them in thier adventure and (sort of) asks them what they feel like doing.  The crazy part about this RPG, is that the DM and Characters are sitting around thier table as they go about thier adventure.Then, introduce EVERY NERD TROPE YOU CAN THINK OF.  Seriously, ALL OF THEM.  I saw a Tardis, Stargate and a Pyramid all in the same background.  Nothing is sacred and nothing is safe, and for that reason the game is a BLAST.			"

												This game is very addicting, but the fun kind of addicting. It was so fun, that i got really sad when i thought that i was approaching the end of the game, but then i realized that it wasn't really the end of the game, so i became happy again. I don't know how far I am into the game now, but I have mostly level 30-40 characters, which i think is about half way to max level, (not sure exactly what max level is though) and this game is still very fun. Over 10 hours and this game still isn't old. I highly recommend this classic RPG styled game			"

												This is not the best looking game, but it is a fun RPG to play.  I run it in a window while I do other things on my PC.The game is a very simple, single player, turn-based, RPG game, where a bunch of friends sit at a table with a DM and play a D&D-type game by a rolling a die to decide everything (view trailer on Steam).  You can have anywhere from 2-5 people in your group.  The graphics are Pixel Art (i.e. very basic square pixels to create everything).  There is a simple map with locations that are level based.  You have a main quest line as well as additional quests per location.  Finishing some quests can open up new quests throughout the map.  There are also dungeons, that have their own maps, monsters, bosses, etc..There are 12 player types and 17 character types, although not all of the player/character types are available initially.  Each player and character can only be used once in your group.  Each player type, gives your character a passive skill.  Each character type, has 4 skills that can be a mix of passive/active skills.  You get a skill point each time you level your character.  There are quests to find the additional player/character types and once they are found they are available to all save slots (see below).The game has three save slots, so you can have three different groups playing the game.  The game only has one pool of gold that is shared between all three save slots.  You can purchase new tables, table items, room accouterments, doors, walls, and other items that will also be shared between all save slots.  So once they are purchased, they are available to all three player groups.  A couple of essential items are the BK Crown and the Holy Grail, which allow you to face 7 enemies at a time (default 5) and have 5 party members (default 3?).  You get bonus XP for larger groups of enemies.  You earn gold at the end of each fight, quest, etc..  You use gold to purchase potions and items from a store/blacksmith/enchanter/etc..  You also need gold to travel.  You can fight at any location to generate some gold as needed.  You can rest after most fights to recoup your health/mana, although a dice will roll to see if you have any interruptions to your sleep.  If your player dies, you can revive them but paying gold.  Initially, your low level character can be resurrected for 0 gold.  I played the game without needing any potions by just using my group's healing and mana generators during a fight or resting after a fight. "

												The game is good and has a nice variety. It's certainly simple, but it has a short-term, addictive charm.The biggest problem by far is that it crashes far too often. I have two different PCs, both easily capable of playing a game like this, and the game has crashed well over a dozen times. The fact that the game doesn't have a save function unless you [save & quit] also makes it frustrating when you lose a lot of progress.With this bug, as of 5/22/14, I can't recommend it.			"

												Love old school RPGing but don't have the time to invest in the latest RPG? Then this is the game for you! Even if you just need something to kill a few minutes every now and then, you can't go wrong with this game.It's classic role-playing finely tuned for a casual gaming experience. You can play this game at your own leisure, choosing to challenge yourself as much as you desire. Choose your party, collect your quests, and pick your encounters. All with the click of a mouse!

												This is an excellent game that makes a lot of references to pencil-and-paper RPGs.  It has a fun retro style, and is full of geeky humor.  It's not very deep, but that works in its favor.  It's the kind of game you can play for a few minutes at a time, or you can go at it for hours to knock a bunch of quests out.			"
