												Edit 12/30/13:I didn't expect such a vast amount of comments for this quick review. I will try to explain why I can't recommend this game and how I came to +250h ingame time, just scroll down to the text under the original review.---- Original review ----Do NOT buy this game - even if it is cheap!Why?The game is still full of bugs even after 2 years and UBISOFT stopped supporting the game.No new patch, no apology, NOTHING. They just got your money, why should they care?The game itself could have been great but with all the fuss I had to endure I won't recommend this piece of garbage to anyone. Trust me, you're better off with buying games which actually deserve your support.I repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Show UBISOFT that they can't treat customers like this.------------------------------1) My rig at the time I bought this game:- Intel i5 2400- Nvidia N560GTX-Ti Twin Frozr II/OC- ASRock P67 Pro3 (B3)- Spinpoint F1 1000GB, SATA II (HD103UJ) then ADATA S511 120GB, SATA 6Gb/s SSD- ADATA 2x4GB 1333MHz CL92) How did you freak manage to get to +250h game time?You can subtract at least a third for the time I encountered crashes, game bugs which forced me to restart a map or simple idle time.I'm also a completionist, an achievement wh*re. In maps without a time frame I usually pick up every treasure, kill every monster and do every sidequest. This type of playstyle is time consuming :).Now take into account that I encountered nasty bugs which forced me to replay a map or browse the web for a solution. And there is also my profile swap which I will explain later.3) Is this a rant against Ubisoft or the game? Why didn't put the game aside and waited for a patch?The game itself could have been great!But it is still bugged and you have to find a way if you want to continue the story. Some achievements are luck based - you get them or not. The only way to get them is to replay the campaign map.I put the game aside for a couple of months in between patch 1.5 until 1.8. The discount on the DLC (-50%) drawn me back.Hope dies last. I wanted to give UBISOFT and their new developer team a chance to fix the game. It's better now but the NVIDIA black screen bug is still there and now they dropped their support.How can I recommend a bugged game to anyone? I simply can not.4) Which (nasty) bugs did you encounter in your long journey?My guess would be 90% because I explored the whole map ;). Just a simple summary about the fixed bugs I encountered in previous game versions and the ones that are still there.I. Nvidia Black Screen Bug (still there)You play the game and suddenly it freezes. Most of the time it's a black screen while the sound is still played. It can happen randomly or it can be reproduced via savegame. Sometimes it can happen in a fight or (no kidding) by walking over a certain spot on the map. I managed to continue the story by loading the savegame and trying every angle.As mentioned above I had a HDD at that time which had a horrible loading time :). From patch to patch there have been improvements or it would get worse. I never rolled back my drivers but I can play it almost without crashes now.I can not safely say which GFX will work without problems. Some do, some don't.II. The achievement swap bug (fixed)Right after a patch a new feature was introduced - looking at achievements of other players.Beeing a jolly fellow I wanted to test it and look where I stand. Bad idea ---My ~85% done achievement list was copied from the one I looked at - a 30% done player.I spent some time to find someone who had at least 80% done and never used that feature again. Guess what - I still had to replay a lot of maps to get that ONE damn missing achievement :).I talked to the UBISOFT customer service that they get my achievements back but they told be that they can't do anything which I do not understand even today. After the short ""We're sorry that we f*cked up but you have to fix it on your own"" conversation I bit my tongue and played on.UBISOFT was so kind to give me a dynasty weapon that I already owned as a compensation :).I contacted the customer service three times about different game related problems and none of them have been resolved.III. The plague bug (fixed)One of my favorites. I happened to meet this little fellow three times.There is no creature growth, in fact it is negative. You can't get any creatures because ""week of the plague"" is active all the time. No creatures means that you have to end the map with the creature stacks you have as your army. Might sound funny but it slows your combat down because you can't afford to lose any unit :).IV. The little bugs (fixed and still there)- Achievements that only trigger sometimes (an example would be in the DLC - the treasure achievement which I tried to get recently)- Crash spots in the the map (also in the DLC and the original game)- Spell or creature related bugs e.g. the famous griffin bug (The creature would not deal any damage when using their special ability). Still a vast amount out there. Some players couldn't finish the tutorial (!) because their creatures wouldn't heal. A game which has a lot of different spell/creature combinations can have a few bugs but not to that amount.- Dynasty weapon which would get lost if you didn't put them on a charater and saved (reloaded) the map. There is still a nasty bug which will happen if you reload the map and use certain class spells (e.g. dark) while having certain dynasty weapons equipped (the spell power goes down, permanently).This is an endless list. If you want to dig any deeper just visit the UBISOFT forum and click on the 334 pages long bug thread.---TL;DR:I could write a little bit more about the game's story and how the maps are designed.The story is fine and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The map design, especially the new DLC (new developers) is brilliant.Why won't I still recommand the game?Because the release version was horrible, the customer ""service"" doesn't deserve the name and the game itself is still a huge pile of bugs with a few moments of happiness.With a continued support (multiplayer = bug-ridden) and an open communication between the fans and the developers this could have been the best game in the series.It is not.I will change my review in that way:If you have an ATI GFX or don't mind restarts, if you are not interested in achievements and are able to restart maps without getting angry then this might be a game for you.About the DRM/Uplay, it is annoying but not that important to me.We're using Steam which is the same but has a lot more time on the market.Granted, Uplay is horrible and I got kicked out of the game every time their servers went down.I developed a habit to press the quicksave button after every turn because I had to reload an older savegame a couple of times. I have a 50Mbit cable connection and traffic is not an issue.On the other hand I never played Mass Effect 3 because of Origin :). I will though.Well, I am done. Thank you for reading and I wish you all the very best!			"

												A good game, unfortunately tied with the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and infuriating online service ever seen. I would play my heroes game - all offline -  for 2-3 hours and then mysteriously the game service would disconnect and I would lose all my progress. Ridiculous for a single player offline game with a AAA price tag. Fail.			"

												The game it's not that bad, but didn't enjoy it as I did with Heroes III. But the support from Ubisoft it's one of the worst I've seen. Couldn't play for a week because they ran out of keys or something, and when asked for a refund they said I had to talk to steam and then steam said to talk to ubisoft, etc. etc. Not mentioning you have to install Uplay to play this, which you should take care because it installs add-ons in your web browser without your consent.EDIT: Forgot to add that you shouldn't buy it for the multiplayer, even after nearly 2 years of release, you'll get desync and/or corrupt your save which won't let you play any further.

												For the following reasons, avoid this game at all costs:1- It's a single player game that requires you to always be online.2- Steam is not enough, you have to register and log int Ubisoft's Uplay3- Ubisoft's Uplay is a piece of garbage. It NEVER works. Thus, you are UNABLE to acess your game.4- Don't even bother to contact Uplay's customer support. They don't bother to answer.5- By the way, Ubisoft NEVER FINISHED THE GAME, and by the looks of it, they never will.As you can see from my records, I did manage to play this game for a while. The game itself is not bad, though it's dlc is buggy and unfinished. The big problem here is the uplay thing, as it will prevent you from enjoying yor game.  "

												No matter how much discount youo get, do not buy this game. Simple as that. I get it that some people say this game is fun, i spend xxx hours on it well worth the money blah blah blah. Whats the point of having a game, if you cant play it when you want to? Whats the point of a game being fun, if you cant play it at all?Many a time during weekends, I boot up my gaming laptop looking for stuff to play, and I open up MnM6. Its just ♥♥♥♥♥ stuck at Uplay trying to find upgrades or Conflux cant connect and stuff. I have completely given up and I accept that Ubi soft scammed a few dollars from me with a vastly inferior product. But you guys still have a chance! DO NOT FALL IN THIS TRAP LIKE I DID!This thing cant even be called a game. Its like buying an iphone realising it is a piece of plastic with a lockscreen painted on it. Its not worth the money and the frustration. Great way to kill a great franchise. With such an attitude towards its product and such an excellent engineering quality, Im sure Ubi will continue to succeed in whatever they do. This is the worst money spent on a game ever for me.

												Guys, as much as we've all encountered a Heroes of Might & Magic game in the past, this one is just another in the trash pile that has been around since Heroes of Might & Magic IV. There are bugs. Lots of bugs. Ubisoft took over primary support of this game since its conception and the bankruptcy of Blackhole in 2011, and there have been 11 official patches to date, all of which fixed one thing, only to break another thing. It's hard for a support company (Ubisoft) to do all the work the parent company was supposed to do, but as it stands, with the announcement in September of 2013, Ubisoft is moving on to greener pastures, and Patch 2.1.1 is the last of the ""fixes"" issued. There are still bugs that can spoil a game, for example, in the campaign mode, where the Town Portal spell has been disabled because there was no town to be used, and that data is saved with your character as they progress to the next level (even after a new map and load screen) and are unable to use the spell even there. The only fix is to restart the campaign all over and ""hope"" that the spell will work anew.Too many things in the game variables are hit-or-miss - random to the point of useless. Though the idea behind dynasty weapons and progressive character leveling, and select campaign character class traits is something innovative, the game really falls short of delivering all its potential because there is no way to avoid even one of these numerical/action-based failures. To be fair, I did find myself enjoying the campaign, albeit generic in some places, even through the bugs.Now, the multiplayer function is where the fun is supposed to be. If there is one good thing about this game, its the 'Hotseat' multiplayer function. I say this to the shame of the online mode which, like its single-player counterpart, has many issues all its own. Technical difficulties abound in the online-mode: random disconnects, frozen turns, black screens, jumpy combat and frazzled animations to name a few. Hotseat seems to avoid the vast majority of these issues, and runs almost identically to the single-player custom and campaign modes.In my final analysis, this game is not at all worth the money Ubisoft has it priced out as, nor is it worth the time I (selflessly) invested in it. There are plenty of other turn-based SRPGs out there, like the earlier versions of the Heroes franchise, like Heroes of M&M 2, or earlier still, Age of Wonders, or even Master of Magic.This particular game just isn't worth your time or money.

												Not sure why I bought this. I didn't like videos of this and what they did too my precious mercury, too, I didn't. But yeah, first about parts I actually enjoyed.The setting of Falcon Empire Era is pretty neat, with all that skulldruggery, old ways of Ilath, orcbros, oceanic weaboo empire, necromancers not as power-hungry cartoon villains, but bizarre keepers of balance (more like it was in Diablo II). Story is good enough too. The split dynasty, the rise of Railag, the crazy adventures of Crag Hack (though I found this one quite boring, but then again, I was playing this for a while at that particular point) and a little fanservice with Sandro cameo (OHGODIT'SREALLYHIM). Dunno about vampire campaign though.Sanctury is a good addition to the world, it's unlike anything you saw in Ashan before and I hope we'll see more of Naga Samurais and Sharkmen in the future.The system of unlockables through seals is decent. Provides a bit of stimulus to play it if you feel you are bored here (and it happens pretty fast).Now, the bad parts.Soundtrack. Quite unremarkable.The balance. The problem here is not overpowering something, but making it too difficult to figure out (the same mistake devs did in HoMMIV with cross-classes and tons of perks). See, there are just too many perk combos you can't really predict, because spells are perks here. In HoMMIII you could point your finger at a guy playing Necropolis or Conflux and call him an a-hole, In HoMMV you could point your finger at Kaspar starter, here...well...you can't. And it's not really a good thing (but it may appear so). Still, if you like overcomplification, you may just ignore what I said.While devs created complications, they simplified the resource part. Which feels...unfair,Ah yes, map layouts. Region - based map isn't a good solution for me. You can't raid mines behind enemy lines, now you have to sabotage them or keep you secondary hero there all the time. This is a huge problem when we come to next point...Overuse of town portals. No really, this is a big issue. While they provide mobility, they are, well, too damn essential. You can easily evade encounter with enemy via it. And...everybody gets it for free. No spell, no perk, you just need enough mana to cast it.Oh, about Conflux service. It wasn't down at the time I played it, so maybe Ubi fixed it. Maybe. Still, I'm okay with being online to play.Still, the review is ""mixed"", so I have to claim ""non-recomendation"" here is gentle here, not strong. You wanna your 60 hours (well, I lasted nearly that amount) for that price - fine, go for it. If not, or you have bad experience with Uplay - better save the money for sale or whatever product on Steam you want more.Heh, probably the longest one I've written so far.			"

												If you came here looking for the best in the Heroes of Might and Magic series, turn around and buy Heroes Of Might and Magic 3. Ideally the complete edition.If you came here for a more recent game play feel and fun game, go buy Heroes V: Tribes of the East.If you are still reading this let me tell you why Might and Magic: Heroes VI Shades of Darkness is bad then you are in luck. The biggest problem with the game is it takes what made the previous games so good, the uniqueness of the different factions, waters them down and makes sure they are all bland different colours of each other. Every race has a creature that operates as a harpy used to, with a strike and return ability. Whole factions have been removed or completely redone, racial abilities and advantages have been removed. None of that made the game unenjoyable for me. No what did that was the horrible Hero system that was implemented.Heroes now come in 2 flavours, Might or Magic. You can no longer see what your hero specialises in beyond their flavour until you have already selected them and are playing away. Most of the heroes and factions are also locked behind a in game store front, they are free but they have to be manually unlocked one by one. We aren't talking a few heroes, there are over 20 that need to be unlocked, with whole factions like the Demons and Stronghold blocked off. Once you are in game it doesn't get much better, if you buy a hero, there is no way of dismissing the hero, other than sending them to their death against a monster stack or enemy hero.  Another bad change that has been made is giving every faction and town two versions of town portal. The first version allows you to teleport a hero and army to any other controlled city, the second one teleports a hero and their army to the nearest town with a portal building. This sounds great, right? Wrong. It completely destroys tactically positioning your heroes on the map and means the enemy just portals away to a town. End games become a constant back and forth of heroess teleporting to at risk towns, a very un-fulfillingg way for games to end.I have had lots of problems gettign the game to run, it has 3 different forms of DRM at work, Steam, Uplay and Conflux. I often find the game wont actually load unless launched through Uplay and only then about 2/3 times. I have had no luck with multiplayer, the game telling me I need to connect to the internet, when I am already connected, which the game knows because of the afore mentioned DRM. The official word from Ubisoft is this requires port forwarding. I have a no desire to go messing around inside my hub's settings. I find the idea that you need to port forward to get the game working, even through Steam, Uplay and Conflux is a joke.Seriously just avoid it at all costs.			"

												Yesterday, I tried to play this game for the first time and couldn't, because Uplay registration failed with the message ""We're unable to create your account right now as a Ubisoft server is unavailable."" Today, I attempted the same thing, with the same result. I literally can't play this game because of the Uplay DRM, and if I'd known before what I know now about the endless issues other users have had, this among them, I would have prevented my girlfriend from buying this for me and for herself.

												This game is crippled by always on DRM. The game booted me back to the menu while in the middle of a battle. My internet connection didn't drop, just their DRM servers. I would have thought by now (over 3 YEARS after release!) Ubisoft would have removed this broken and draconian DRM system, but it appears not.Even after Ubisoft said they have abandoned always on DRM back in 2012 in favour of a one-time activation, it looks like they didn't bother to patch it out of their older games - even after 3 years!DO NOT BUY.

												Disclaimer: I only played campaigns. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. The problem is that M&M:H is not HoM&M. Heroes of Might and Magic games were strategy games with RPG elements. This one...even the name is just wrong...  I don't know what it tries to be. It's no longer strategy game because of all oversimplifications in the mechanics  and AI blatantly cheating. Yes, computer needs some advantages to make things challenging but in previous games it was limited to giving AI better starting position, some free resources and ability to win fights withour losses. In this game however computer is not bound by the most fundamental rule of this game: production limits. This means player and AI no longer play the same game. This is intolerable in strategy.So perhaps it's meant to be RPG with strategy elements, like Kings' Bounty? Well, the game doesn't do that either, because it's turned based and thus lacks the liveness and pacing of KB.Then there are 'dynasty artifacts'. This is possibly the worst idea in the history of the franchise. Acquiring good artifacts before your opponent used to be imporant aspect of the game. Now, you open a menu and equip a relic of your choosing at the start of each map.  Because UPlay.There are some good ideas in this game. For example: I like 3-tier unit system. If it's better than 7-levels from H3 and 5 is a matter of taste, but it worked better than I expected. As much as I like (or used to like) the franchise, I cannot really recommend this game. For die hards Heroes fans only.			"

Might & Magic: Heroes VIReleased: Oct 2011Developer: Black HolePublisher: UbisoftPros: Campaign story lines are some of the better written and more interesting ones in the series. Pleasing aesthetic, good overall visual design. OST is a mixed bag but there are some very nice tracks as well. Factions and their units are well designed. Each faction has their flavour, and almost all combat units have unique traits and abilities.Cons: Uplay.  Not that I am that much against it, but Uplay has deleted my saves for this game a number of times, it is infuriating. An additional THIRD DRM layer called Conflux that you must be connected to at all times to access Dynasty weapons or traits, even in single player.  If you for any reason lose connection to it while playing a game, it will drop you to the main menu without even saving your game first. Technical issues.  Black screen when loading Town or Battle screens happen frequently, forcing game restarts.  With many mice, just moving the cursor on the screen makes the frame rate literally freeze to 0. Bugs.  Dozens, if not hundreds of bugs, minor and major have been in this game since release.  Not one frak has been given by the developers and the publisher to fix anything, focusing instead of pumping out DLC.  Some examples:  Many hero skills either do literally nothing, or act REVERSE.  Picking 'Pathfinding' for example doubles the rough terrain penalty instead of reducing it!  Almost all Dynasty weapons can severely cripple your hero permanently, when equipped.  Some will reduce your hero's magic power each day it is equipped, 'Affinity' weapons increase your spell costs to unmanageable levels.  Maps also have a number of bugs. I've several times had to restart a map from the start, after finding out for playing for hours that a keep I had to capture for a quest, simply did not spawn on the map properly, for example. Instead of getting a choice of skills, when heroes level they put points into a talent tree.  I personally dislike this method, it takes the fun out of hero development.  Once you learn what skills are good, you typically build all your heroes the same way. Atrocious AI.  Some of the worst I've seen, possibly rivalled by the HOMM IV AI only.  It literally doesn't play the same game as you.  It is given huge amounts of resources each day. but even then doesn't understand the concept of upgrading its towns.  It is given heroes and large armies for free every week to send at you, with a larger army each week.  Wipe them out too slow and their free unit spam will soon vastly outnumber anything the players can buy in their towns.  Adventure map armies also grow in the same manner, a strong design flaw that makes rushing for the win the single most important priority on every map you play, every time.  I was very disappointed to learn how the game actually works in the regard. In combat, particularly during the campaigns, nothing comes close to the importance of healing and resurrecting units, to minimize casualties in each battle.  It is basically the only really viable way to play the campaigns without losing too many units to be able to finish the maps.  I would have liked to see other viable ways to play.Other thoughts:There isn't that much else to say.  This is one of the weakest and most disappointing games in the series, which could have been pretty good if it was only given the chance.  It is disgusting to see how this release was handled, with zero effort taken into patching out all the bugs and problems it suffers, Ubisoft instead only focusing on producing more bugged DLC's to sell.  Game design wise I was not a fan of the simplified resource management and hero development either, but I could have lived with it if the rest of the game was in a playable state.It's a big shame, since I was actually really enjoying the campaigns, having tested the Haven, Necro and Sanctuary ones, but the gamebreaking bugs prevent me from being able to finish any of them.  I am not interested in restarting them over and over to play around the bugs.For those looking for a high fantasy strategy game to play I would recommend steering clear of MMH VI and instead getting HOMM III Complete from www.gog.com, or perhaps try my personal favourite in the series, HOMM V with both its expansions, its patches and the superb AI improvement third party mod.

Good luck to you guys who choose to ignore these warnings like i did, give you money to these thieves and make them millionaires with your hard earned money.PD: Ever since I installed the Ubisoft launcher my computer is messed up, internet keeps falling, steam keeps hanging up, i have to reset my router every 10 minutes. I recuperated a safety copy on my PC just before I installed this crap, and now 2curiously2 everything works fine. NEVER INSTALL UBISOFT MALAWARE. "

												Did I have fun while playing? - Yes, when I wasn't busy cursing it for all the bugs it had.For players looking to buy the game, here are a list of bugs I remember offhand  that really spoit my gaming experience.-Bugged pathfinding, that your talents make you move lesser instead of further.-Bugged spell dynasty weapon, that made you lose spellpower EVERY TURN and EVERY RELOAD (you will not be able to see it in your character doll tooltip). This actally forced me to restart my first campaign after 2 maps... as my magic character was totally useless by the time I discovered it.-Bugged spells that don't work as indicated. This isn't a game breaking thing but when I pay for my game I expect it to work as intended.-Conflux which forces you to be always online in order to use and level your dynasty weapons, among other things. I don't mind being always online, but when it loses connection and it does it often enough, it kicks you back to the main screen WITHOUT saving. Yea so you lose all your progress. With auto save it is not nearly as bad as it sounds but it's bad. REALLY BAAAADDD.All in all I wouldn't really recommend it to any new players. After reading weeks of forums it does not appear that Ubisoft will be putting much effort to supporting it further, that is no more major patches, if any at all. In the current state (patch 2.1.1) it is playable, but just barely. And if you do play it, be prepared to swear. A lot.			"

												It's a decent game, you'll really enjoy it if you do like the Heroes franchise, there's really nothing else to be said.HOWEVER... It does force Uplay on you and in most of my experiences with the game its been messing with the online play and it doesn't really matter if its fun because in the end, Ubisofts DRM makes it unplayable and it grows really tiresome after a while and when you want to play with friends, well you can't. Simple as that.The mix with servers not working, online play not working and Uplay is ruining the experience, this is not the 90s we shouldn't have to spend hours to try and fix problems with our games when all we wanted to do was to play online with friends, its disgraceful to release a game with software like this.This is how i would rate this game:7/10 - Single player1/10 - multiplayer because its unplayable and it will drain the fun right out of you.This is the game that made me boycotte Ubisoft games because they're just not a PC-friendly company.

												Overall, I think this could be a great game. It holds your hand a little too much for my tastes, but it is still true M&M amazingness. HOWEVER - and this is a huge deal - I do not reccommend purchasing this game for the crazy protection it has. It requires you to install uPlay so it is redicilous that I have to run uPlay through Steam just to play Heroes VI. And if at any time you disconnect from the internet, the game just quits. No autosave, no nothing. It is completely unacceptable to punish someone for playing your game, when I could play it happily offline with a pirated version. Won't be getting any Ubisoft products in the future.			"

												Mediocre HoMM game♥♥♥♥ed up, dumbed down economy system, less resources to find more grind. Bad factions with even more bad units. Slower than any other HoMM, unnecessary animations everywhere, slow turns  and a smaller map with bigger units just makes the whole experience unpleasant. To make this whole game any ♥♥♥♥♥ier, add a DRM which doesnt work most of the time and a built-in DRM by the name of CONFLUX which forces you to stay online, even to play a single game, power goes off ? you lose the internet connection ? CONFLUX kicks you out of the game. Sub-par HoMM gameSlow and  bad TBRTS with bad factions and horrible unit designIntrusive DRMs at every corner. Skip it like the plague. "

												I realized early that Heroes 6 is the weakest installment of the series. It has an utterly generic story that has nothing to do with the events of the previous titles and a gameplay that lacks any inspiration. But I could have ignored that, since, despite being not a very good title, the game still has some solid entertainment.What really killed it for me is the ""always online"" issue, even if you really just want to play a single-player game and don't even care about multiplayer. While being always online in Steam is usually a non-issue, having to be always online on the notoriously unstable Uplay network can be a pain.Also if Uplay servers are down for any reason and you try to work around that by starting the client in offline-mode the game will begin giving you trouble. For example it will refuse to let you load any of your savegames, because games you played while you were online are not available when you are offline. And if it has a particularly bad day it will deactivate completely, tell you that your version of Heroes 6 is ""unregistered"" and demand that you go online to register your already registered game another time before you are allowed to play the game again. So that's my real issue.However, if you need another reason, then here is a word for those of you who just happen to be die-hard fans of the series like me: please take my warning. This game does NOT continue the events of Heroes 5 and/or Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It is a prequel that surrenders the previous story-line completely.I mean: Bloody hell! It's not like Ubisoft left us with a cliffhanger after Heroes 5, where the dark messiah, possessed by a half-naked, smoking-hot succubus, stopped the necromancers and their alliance of the willing from dropping weapons of mass-destruction on the underworld, destroyed the skull of the seventh dragon to free the demon-lord and open the gates of hell. So that the dark lord would rise from the abyss speaking the magic words: ""I am your father"". You know - introduce some global warming: the lucifer-way. And right before we found out if the world was going to end and if beelzebub actually can be a picture-book daddy... curtains dropping! The end.And here comes Heroes 6 and it starts with the words ""2000 years earlier""! Wait a minute, Ubisoft: I thought we just had some serious armageddon and succubus-action going on here! What happened to good old: smash skull first, eat brains later?So honestly: unless you are really desperate for another Might and Magic title, just skip Heroes 6 and wait for Heroes 7. You won't be missing out on anything at all.			"

												After being in love with Heroes 2 and 3 i thought this game would be great. Now that UBIsoft own the game franchise I feel there is no more passion being put into it. Since Ubisoft FORCE you to have Uplay i cant play it by its self, which is a problem when Uplay doesnt want to work on my computer.

												I was a big fan of the series and in particular, I really enjoyed Heroes III and V. This new sequel has left a bitter taste to my mouth. If the campaign is not resolved in a particular way that the AI wishes then you are either stuck on the scenario until eternity or you have to restart it. Another negative point for me is that the AI ""cheats"" meaning that they get disproportionate bonuses or irrational advantages in order to stay competitive relative to human players. Although considerable ammount of work has gone into this title, the game does grow stale and tedious after a while. You get the impression that you're a hamster in a trainning wheel. So despite being a big fan of previous titles, I'll have to decline giving a positive reccomendation for this one.			"

												Game itself is 7 or 8/10. It has some good ideas. Campaigns are ok. Battles are ok.Reason I strongly disencourage you from buying this game is Uplay/Conflux and Ubisoft policy.I wasted 15+ hours dealing with Uplay, bugs and crushes.I lost all my clouded saves. Support haven't responded yet. So I replayed half of Campain.I met game breaking bug with stucked enemy hero. Bug known for year on forum. I had to replay map 3 times to avoid this event. Screen go black sometimes when you enter city or battle or game just crush without anything. This occurs every 1-2 hours.Every time I need to reload the game I see unskipable logo of company I will avoid. GJ Ubisoft.			"

												While the game itself ""as is"" is not so bad, the following are the points which are just plainly put, true facts which heavily outweight the positive points of the game:- Gamebreaking bugs present- No continuing support from Ubisoft- Broken 3rd party DRM that you have to forcefully shut down with task manager (after you closed it with regular means via UI).- Tactical field in sqares and not hexagons (simply put - from software engineering perspective squares are ""easier"" to implement).- No communication with community in forums.- Game must be 24/7 connected to internet (Conflux). Not a problem, except in cases where the ""Conflux"" is down whole weekends.- Scenario has a ""canon"" story progression which must be played in specific order to really enjoy the campaign; there are many people who simply played a single faction from start to end and just spoiled the whole story. The campaign must be played with each faction in parallel...these details were not present anywhere ingame...details were provided in forums not by Ubisoft, but by the fanbase which analysed the story progression across all factions mission by mission.- Might & Magic system which is totally ridiculous and not connected with original titles (Gain new spells by putting your level up point in a spell...there are no random spells to be found, or spells researched in towns).- The supposed morale (Tears and Blood) system which should have led to many many different kinds of endings, yields only just a minor difference in the final missions (you end up with one or another hero accompanying you). Therefore this system is there just to sprinkle confetti around in E3 presentations and etc.Some good things:+ Art & music i guess.			"

												I purchased a single player game, why do I need to sign up for a secondary account to play a single player game.  If I wanted to sign up for an online game, sure, make me sign up for an online account, but I dont really game online very much.  I might even be able to tollerate having to sign up for a secondary gaming account through the game creators, but the game keeps telling me it cant register my account because they have no available servers.  Thus, I cant play the game.  If I cant play the game, Ive wasted my money.  Trying to tell me otherwise will be wasting your time.  If the game creators fix this issue and I can finally play, I might change this review, but as it stands, I would not reccomend buying this game.Edit and update:  The service they want me to sign up for is called Uplay, and is similar to Steam and Games for Windows Live, which are both services meant to sell and confirm that I legally own a game.  My problem with this is when I buy a game off ONE of these sites, I dont expect to have to register it to a second one.  Ive spent months trying to get this ""Uplay"" program to update and run properly.  Ive tried updating it, checking to make sure it functions properly with my firewall, and just about everything else imaginable.  When Uplay runs properly, I managed to get this game registered to a Uplay account and logged into Uplay via my new account.  I did everything as was part of the deal and it either crashes upon launching, or it loads properly and claims it ""cant find the game file"".... and THEN crashes.  I did manage to get the game to load ONCE, and it crashed within 5 minutes of loading.  I didnt even get past the menu screen.As of now, Im done trying.  I cannot recommend any M@M games that involve this Uplay farce until it works properly.  I purchased a game, I should be able to play said game.  Because I cannot, I fail to see why I should ever buy another game from this company.			"

												I bought it on weekend -75% sale and it wasn't even worth those few euros. Uplay makes the game 100% unplayable - I wasn't able to run it after creating the Uplay account at all. Maybe I'll just have to crack the legally bought game in order to enjoy it.As usual, legal customers are the ones that get screwed by irresponsible publisher.Mar 15: Now that I somehow managed to run the game, maybe it's time to say something about the game itself, not the DRM.Within those 5-6 hours played I'm in 2nd scenario of Necropolis campaign. Here's my experience:+ Heroes can travel without army and scenarios don't end with failure after one lost battle, the hero can be resurrected+ I may be the minority that likes the concept of teritorial control in order to profit from mines and dwellings+ Option of converting cities and dwellings to your fraction is a big gamechanger~ Abandoning creature levels (1-7) in favor or ""tiers"" (Core, Elite, Champion) is something I did not expect and I'm unsure whether it's a good or bad thing~ Not sure how to feel about Altar of Wishes, as it gives you possibility to ""purchase"" bonuses improving your heroes. I'd be okay with it if it was only for profile customization, like titles etc.~ Interface is pretty much a copypaste from Heroes 5 which can be either perceived as lazyness, or an intentional move to stick to something that players are familiar with- Be always online to play the campaign- Some of the soundtrack (as well as some sound effects) is just a rehash from Heroes 5 and Dark Messiah (I'm looking at you, Inferno town theme)- Did you like full 3D town screens in Heroes 5? I loved them. Bid farewell to them, because here we're back to 2D drawings. Of course they are pretty, but I loved town screens in H5.Overall, the review is still a ""no"", even though I'm somewhat enjoying playing it, but that may be just a long desire to get a new taste of Heroes. I'm not saying ""you shouldn't buy this game"" - it's more like ""I can't pinpoint to whom I'd recommend this game"". If you like Heroes series and 7,5 euros isn't too big deal for you, sure, go for it. If not, maybe other reviews will help you make up your mind.			"

												Honestly, just don't buy this game. Ubisoft did a number on the game, especially with their support.I seriously love the series, and have been playing them since the first installment. So I started playing VI, and quite enjoyed, except that I was surprised by the amount of bugs and game-crashes it had. But then, in October 2012, the game just froze everytime the city-screen opened. Searching through the fora I was not the only one with that issue. It took a few weeks for any update on this issue.The reaction of Ubisoft for 6 months long (!) was: ""just don't update your NVIDIA drivers, and go back to an older version of NVIDIA, untill we release a patch in April 2013"". I bought a game and have been unable to play it for 6 months. It's now december 2013, ubisoft have stopped the support for the game since september, and it is STILL riddled with dozens of bugs.Just don't get it.

Also note that if your internett connnection goes down or if you want to play somewhere without a internet connection. Sorry no can do because you must be connected to ""unlock"" your game with the great oh so stable Uplay app which is crappy and unstable.Sorry Ubisoft you have lost me as a customer forever. It should be enough that we autenticate thru Steam.Uplay is just a stupid low life paranoid controll freak application.EDIT:After getting some Assasins creed game as a prensent from my bro I once again had to try to get uplay to work.

												I have been a fan of Heroes of Might and Magic since Heroes II The Price of Loyalty.  Heroes III is arguably the best in the franchise.  I really enjoyed Heroes IV though.And then came UbiSoft...It seemed their mission was to destroy the beloved franchise.  With Heroes V came lame, watered-down spell-casting.  The graphics were good in 2007, I had no problems there.  The inability to divide your troops in your army was bad.  I had all but given up on Heroes of Might and Magic.Then I saw Heroes VI.  The graphics are fantastic.  The animation is good.  The storyline is interesting, if a bit underdeveloped.  I like the ability to convert towns, forts, and dwellings.  I have played this game for over 240 hours, and beaten all of the campaigns and expansions.  I like the hours of playability it provides for one player.  It doesn't hinge on multiplayer like so many other games do these days.  I love the Necropolis in this game.  The Altar of Eternal Servitude provides a deliciously twisted advantage as your army never dies, depending on if you have enough resources.  The Haven is excellent despite only one shooter.  I'm better with the Sanctuary than even the Necropolis.  The Stronghold is just impressively strong.  I like the Dungeon expansion.Now for what I don't like:1.  I don't like how you have to go through UPlay whenever you turn the game on or off.  ""Synchronizing Your Saved Games With The Cloud"" takes a very long time, and only works maybe 12% of the time.  It is highly frustrating.  I want to be able to click on the game and have it load.  When I quit to desktop, I want the game to quit.  This is the first game I've had to deal with these issues.  The benefit UPlay seems to provide does not outweigh the cost of time and sanity.2.  I don't like how I reached Platinum level before I completed all of the campaigns.  On paper, I should be one of the best players in the world.  Once you max out on experience there really isn't much to play for.  On campaigns the maximum hero level happens too quickly.  The maps are epic in scope, and there is so much to do, but if you max out your levels one-fifth of the way through the map then it's not fun anymore.  I understand that the experience keeps going into the dynasty weapons, but you really don't see that happening.  Let us players continue to grow!3.  I don't like the Haven's faction ability.  They are pretty much the antithesis of the Necropolis except for the faction ability.  Necromancy heals troops, but Guardian Angel doesn't?  At least until level IV.  No, the Haven faction ability should be healing.4.  The Necromancers differ in this game in that they don't raise skeletons after each combat.  Other than that, I love the Necropolis.5.  I do not like that troop growth is centered around your overall kingdom.  I miss having a lot of troops.  Instead of only getting 8 Core creatures a week, for instance, you should get those 8 Core creatures from every castle you own plus every creature dwelling every week.  That is one upgrade I do not like.  At least you have the ability to divide your troops in your army, and among secondary heroes.  Give us more troops!6.  I have a very nice gaming computer, and Heroes VI still glitches to where I have to just shut the game down and start back at the last save.  And that takes forever because I'm waiting for Uplay to sync.  Glitches happen, I know, but I haven't heard of any patches in months.7.  The Inferno has been completely castrated.  It's so hard to look at.  I get the Chaos aspect, but still...Inferno has been done better.  Get rid of the Inferno and bring back the Sylvan elves.8.  I absolutely hate spell recharges.  The whole point of having a Magic hero is to be able to obliterate enemies with spells.  Casting Lightning Bolt once every three turns sucks when in previous games you could cast it every turn.  The mana is mismanaged in this game too.  Your hero may have 200 mana, but each spell costs 45, 37, or some other random amount of mana?  No, take some lessons from what 3DO did correctly.  Unleash the spellcasters again!9.  Though I like having the skills and abilities options Heroes VI provides, the levels are few and far between, so it's hard to take the path you want to take when you level up.  That's just a minor issue with me though.10.  I hate how the Boss fights give you a pre-set number of troops.  What is the point of building an army for the whole map if you can't use all of your troops in the final Boss fight?!  I understand the need for a challenge, but there is something so satisfying in having an overwhelming army that you just spent 3 hours running around assembling.  I like the introduction of Boss fights into this game, but please let us bring in our full army and wreak havoc!11.  Maybe it's just me, but the AI is super hard on the Scenarios.  I can barely beat a single AI on Easy let alone levels with multiple enemies.  I have no idea how the enemy assembles such a huge army before I do, etc.  Maybe I just suck, I don't know (I don't think I suck that badly).  That's just another issue I have.Overall, I love this game.  It has given me hours of playability, and for that I am grateful.  It is a visually-stunning and beautiful game.  The Inferno is so hard to look at, but the beauty of the Sanctuary makes up for it.  If they make a Heroes VII I hope it is a lot like Heroes VI, but with the changes I have suggested.  Take away a cliche Demon threat and give us some other storyline.  Let the armies grow like they did with 3DO and Heroes V so the Might heroes can thrive, and take the recharges off the spells so the Magic heroes can thrive.  I recommend this game highly, but with those caveats.What is dead may never die!-- Kingsley "

												For the record, this could be very good game. Soundtrack is great, graphics too. Progress of story gives motivation to continue. Fights are (mostly) enjoyable. Still, there are things in this game which make me furious.I have game on Steam. When I launch it I must wait several minutes because Uplay must search for proxy, login and occasionaly update. Then finally game starts - and it logins to another network junk called Conflux. And now it becomes interesting. Because if you play with conflux there are additional items you can use in game. If you start game and loose internet connection orsomething similar, these saves you had are not available at all and you may start from beginning. Multiplayer game in HOMM 5 was possible using lan network. In this game you can forget about it, only internet based multiplayer game is possible (again using conflux). Even if you want to play with someone sitting opposite of you. It doesn't sound too bad - but all attempts to play I have tried end after few turns because conflux looses connection or something similar. Multiplayer game is essentially impossible.Singleplayer game is ok, but some maps quickly become boring. On normal difficulty setting it is common that 'level cap reached' show up while half of the map is still hidden. However important enemies are still terribly strong and armies defending gold and artifacts are usually very simple to beat (or so difficult that it doesn't make sense to fight them - all income is not enough to buy lost units back). So after promising start there is lot of sitting and waiting and buying new units each week. So far the most enjoyable game was for Haven fraction.And finally, there are still bugs. When combat should start sometimes screen remains black and there is no way out just switch to taskmanager and kill the game. There are some workarounds mentioned in forums (change in settings of nvidia driver)  but even then it is not 100% reliable. If you can make several important fights in one turn, save after every one of them!So if you don't care about multiplayer, you like HOMM series and you see this game on sale then you may give it a tryBut I am terribly dissapointed. I will try to finish the game for the story but I am putting Ubisof on my blacklist.			"

												Ugh, sunk a lot of hours into this (60), tried really hard to like it, as I played all other Heroes games... but this game is such a complete fail at its core that its just impossible to really enjoy. When every mission is based on AI cheating through the roof to make it challenging, thats just unacceptable for a game in this day and age. I read the developers blog after they finished the game and were closed down, looks like UBI Soft really screwed them, which is a shame, and they didnt get to finish half of the game mechanics they were going to, which is also a shame. This game is a massive mess with fairly pretty graphics, but for Heroes series fans, its a tomb.			"

												Utterly broken game. Multiplayer is a shambles, disconnecting all the time, giving black screens between fights that means you have to bomb the game out plus a multitude of other bugs. The worst crime however is the difficulty level is ridiculous! I don't mind a difficult game, if I SET it to difficult. On EASY, in the tutorial, it's almost impossible to win. Myself and a friend have tried to no avail. If you CAN win, it's not by playing the game in a fun way--- it's by ignoring all of it and steaming ahead. Bad game with dreadful developer support.

												I've decided to mini-review the M&M Heroes 6 + expansions pack, after finishing the entire campaign series.Without further ado, gameplay-wise!Gameplay Strong Points:Fairly Competent AI most of the time.Last series of fixes have reduced exploitability by a fair marginCampaign objectives make sense.Decent series of units, most complement each other.Heroes matter, a lot.Gameplay weak Points:Migh vs Magic heroes...Magic heroes often end grossly overpowered for campaign play.AI during skirmishes either wins all neutral battles flawlessly, or gets stuck without a fair army.AI coded to do the same series of attacks over and over again.Game still liable to CTD, especially with nvidia graphics cards.AI failmoves, but what game doesn't have that?Story, Graphics and Misc. Good Points.Campaigns last you quite a few hours each.Dynasty goodies, special side quests and hidden bonusses makes exploring a reward.Maps offer different approaches, lots of goodies and quite a challenge at times.Bad points.Story and dialogue wise, it's pretty generic. I personally didn't really care for the story much, deeming the theme and way the theme was handled overused.Campaign mission difficulty gaps. Some missions are insanely hard, only to be followed up with a cakewalk, or vice versa. Some missions also require replays because they punish a mistake you made early on a few steps from endgame.Tear of Asha. Cute that it's included, but ends up being overkill on half the maps it's given on.No Random Map Generator, killing the replay value of the skirmish maps very, very much.Item Placement at skirmish maps makes no sense, oftentimes giving you a completed moon disk/tear/full set/epic artifacts/et cetera ad nauseum before even getting past flagging your first mines.Overall though, it's not as bad as people yell at times and certainly worth a try if you're into the type of game, especially if it goes on sale.The full package, even when lacking a RMG for skirmish + obvious flaws during the playthroughs, still holds a bit of appeal.If I'd have to grade the game without comparing it to previous games of the series, it'd come out on a 7-(6.75 for those unfamiliar with +s and -'s).Worth a try if you like the series or the genre, do pass if it's not up your alley.

If you like the Heroes (strategy) games, then this is probably worth 10 bucks but not more. I recommend waiting for a nice sale or buying Heroes V with Hammers of Fate and Tribes of the East addon if you haven't got them.			"

												Might & Magic Heroes VI. My first observation about this game is why did they have to change around the name? What was so wrong with Heroes of Might & Magic?Probably the most important thing you need to know about this game is that it uses Ubisoft's draconian ""always-on"" DRM meaning that if the Ubi servers or god forbid, your own connection cuts out, you can expect to lose any progress since your last save and quite often get a corrupt save as well.Heroes is a very pretty game and disregarded the weird caching issues and the slow loading times it is a visually very impressive game.The problem with this game however is that you aren't trying to win battles, you are trying to win battles without losing any units. Because the AI is 100% predictable this becomes more like a puzzle game quite quickly, trying to find the perfect tactic.Major imbalance in the RPG system doesn't help either and this just feels like a game that was released purely to cash in on the name.

												I'm not going to spend much time on this, and to be honest it's been a while since I played it, but since it annoyed me so much at the time, I might as well voice my complaints:The main issue is, for me, the fact that this has a 3rd-party DRM - the Ubisoft launcher. This is also the reason for the high number of hours in my profile. I spent them having it on in the background, waiting for Ubisoft to fix their &§$% DRM, not playing. In my opinion, having a DMR tool when a game is already on Steam is pointless, and then having it malfunction is close to unforgivable.As for the game itself: I found it rather uninspired. It's a slightly more polished version of Heroes V, with a few units switched around, the option to convert all cities to your main type and control of mines regulated by capturing forts instead of individual mines. The latter is actually a good idea, but the former makes the game more boring. Storyline and animation are also seriously sub-par for the time it came out. Finally, the difficulty of maps seemed to stem more from the incresible amount of troops the AI could field and less from using those that it had effectively. All in all: Don't buy this, save your money to get a complete edition of Heroes V (or better yet, Heroes IV).			"

												When i first bought this game, i was on a high from M&M V, which was an amazing game. I was really looking forward to play a new Heroes game, which better graphics and good old school gameplay.... So what did i get? A game, which is actually worse then V in pretty much all factors. The gameplay is worse, the graphics are worse and the world itself is confusing and really not well put together. The campaign itself is also pretty bad, and while it has some great boss moments here and there, the game just dissappoint.If you have not played Heroes V, DONT BUY THIS GAME. Buy Heroes V instead and if you really like that, then you can proberly survive this game aswell and enjoy to some extent.Now to the very bad part. The game alone is proberly a 6,5-7/10, eventhough it is worse then V, but the thing, which nearly makes this game unplayable is the goddamm Uplay integration. But what is so bad abou the Uplay thing? Well, let me sum up:1:It blocks you from playing the game an account on their service, which would not be bad if the servers worked all the time, but you are gonna find yourself limited by how the servers work.2: Unless you have internet connection all the time, the game blocks features from your gameplay. Hero weapens and ingame achievments are blocked and the game is nearly unplayable without these weapens.3: You will constantly battered with announcements from Uplay while you play, which can really stop a good gaming stride.All in all, the game is alright, maybe even a bit bad, but this game really made me hate Ubisoft. They have ruined the Heroes genre and they are only making it worse with Heroes 7. So my advice? Play more of Heroes 3 and 5, they are amazing games and you are not forced to stay connected all the time to play these games. You can actually go on vacation and enjoy some strategy, without Ubisoft interfering.			"

												First of all: I always liked the Might & Magic series. It followed me through my childhood and youth and though I could never really get good at it, I still enjoyed the mechanics, visuals and the idea itself.Now we're at Might & Magic: Heroes VI and boy what a long way lies behind us. But what kind of game do we have now?I knew that UPlay would come along with this game so I struggled a long long time before I finally bought the series in a sale. After I played approx 2 hours I totally regret this decision. Why?1. Uplay. This thing is so clunky and annoying. It gives you nothing but yet another piece of software that somehow holds your games hostage. Ubisoft is one of the big publishers but seeing and using Uplay makes you think: damn, a bunch of small budget devs could have put together something better. Even the GOG Website is done better than Uplay. It's just an insult. 2. The game keeps crashing. How is that even possible? This game is made by a damn big publisher and could have gotten several updates. But no, it keeps crashing 2 hours in the campaign. That is just not acceptable. 3. The AI is a joke. They predict your moves and know everything you know. It is just no fun to play against an AI that has basically 0 element of surprise and just plays unfair. It sure reminds me of the old Rainbow Six days when the enemy AI had instant knowledge of your moves and actions as soon as you were 100m close. That is yet another insult and infuriates me. 4. The interface is very questionable. While it looks kinda neat, it is just not useful. It is big, full of blingy graphics and other damn beautiful crap but hell it just does not appear useful in any way. Maybe we have grown to a ""everything MUST be minimalistic"" state of mind, still a strategy game does not need to be super shiny. It needs information on the spot, not after clicking and mouse overlays.I will try to get a refund as this is just not acceptable or at least playable. Yet another series ruined Ubisoft. Thanks			"

												Absolute ♥♥♥♥ if you can't even play it. Paying good money for a game you expect to work, but doesn't because uPlay won't start. A known issue apparently for years, yet not advertised as sold on Steam, therefore Steam are deliberately permitting the sale of goods that are not capable of working via other software that is a requirement. Do not waste your money.			"

												I uninstalled this game because uPlay wouldn't let me play my own game. One of the times that it actually let me in, it kicked me out of single player mode because my connection to their DRM server dropped and I lost all of my turn....progress lost because of a dropped internet connection...in single player. This happened about 3-4 times before I just uninstalled. I am reminded why I don't buy games from Ubisoft at all. I forgot this and bought Farcry 3 when it was on sale...first time I tried to play...2 different errors and a uPlay reinstall before it would let me play my own game.  Screw these guys.			"

												I am a big Heroes of Might and Magic fan, atleast i was... before playing this game. It is a pure pain to play this as the game is crashing every few minutes, then the game even fails to sync with cloud for resulting in loss of saved games. I have never regretted buying a game until now. I hope that ubisoft chokes on my money.			"

												The story is amazing, but that's about it.All computer controlled units (including neutrals) scale so fast such that it becomes impossible to engage in any combat unless you have all your units/resouces pooled onto your main hero, meaning that any secondary hero you happen to get is nothing more than a glorified unit courier; a feature that was absent in all other games of this series. Consequently, losing a single unit on a single stack is enough to warrent a reload. The game has been out a long time and still the final 'dynasty perk' slot hasn't been unlocked for use; even at max level and with all DLC. Finally, the game has a random crashing issue that has yet to be resolved; the crash may occur within five minutes of starting or after six hours of play.Despite all this though, the game is surprisingly balanced (again, assuming all your recources are pooled to your main hero) and the units are refreshingly diverse across all races.TL;DR If you're a fan of the series and have played one of the predecesors this game is a big disappointment. If you're new to the series or the genre in general: wait for it to go on sale.			"

												BEWARE: The game tend to freeze on certain Nvidia graphics cards, with no fix to my knowledge. I have Geforce 640M and the game freezes about every hour. That is the reason for my short game time. I'm still waiting for a fix.However it's a good game which brings back some of the features people loved in Heroes of Might and Magic 3 - like isometric view far superior to the 3D view from HoMM V. The skill system, however, is restructured to a static tech tree stripped from random elements from the Mage Guilds, which is removed. I don't particulary like it.			"

												I loved the might and magic series and even liked this game while it worked, after a patch, about a year ago, the game remained unplayable, I searched for solutions, and even tried it on two of my systems and the game would crash upon load.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled to attempt to load the game on each new video card, and mb/cpu combo, even 3 video cards later, have just tried again to load this with the same issue.  This is not the only game I have had dificulty with Ubisoft, I will refrain from buying any UBISOFT games that requires Ubisoft's front end to play.  Goodby Ubisoft... companies like this hurt PC gaming leaving PC'ers in frustration and moving to other systems.  Suggest you pass on this game untill its rock bottom priced!..and then hope for the best.			"

												I would honestly love to give this game what its ancestors deserved. But it just doesn't cut it. It is not what i learned to love in Heroes of Might and Magic III and it doesn't fill the void that Heroes of Might and Magic IV created.The campaign seems to be loosely sewed together, it is not the tragic destinies that made me want to go on. At all.The menus are damn confusing because things like an ""ingame currency"" has been introduced with which one can buy more heroes etc. Hell, i already bought the game. If i go for a ""Free-for-All"" game, i want to be able to pick everything available. I want to get to KNOW the race i'm playing with.Apart from that, Uplay sucks. Hard. It is honestly one of the biggest reasons i never touched this game again. Simply because i don't wanna go through the struggle to start this Hump-in-the-Face of Software. It is annoying to have a second DRM behind Steam just because the publisher forces it upon their customers.TL;DR: Graphics and Level of Detail nice, Campaign and Long-time motivation sucks, so does Uplay.

												Yay! Got it on sale!!!!  Except that it took hours to download a rediculously large game file, especially for a game that is older. Fiiiinally finished downloading and it took another hour to download Uplay. Created a Uplay account, attempt to verify my game code, which is a pain becaue Uplay doesn't allow for copy and pasting, code is not accepted. Retype, nothing. Try a DLC code, nothing, Retype DLC code  ****YOU HAVE BEEN BANNED FOR 24 HOURS*****  The reason being, I attempted to validate a game code too many times. Are you freakin serious Ubisoft? How about giving me a game code that works?!?!?! $5 or not, if you can't give me what I paid for, I expect a refund. Once my ban is lifted, I will attempt to validate the codes again and if they are not valid, I will be contacting my credit card company and denying the charge.

												I strongly recommend you play this game if you love turn based strategy games, RPG games, or are a sucker for a good story. Easily one of the best strategy games I have ever played (and I have played a hell of a lot!) - don't be scared of UPlay and Conflux (more on this later).The game is at its core a Turn Based Strategy game, but also has strong RPG elements - levelling up, skill points, hero inventory, reputation points, faction variations etc. I would strongly suggest watching some YouTube videos to see how the game plays out.Briefly speaking you have a game map where you move your heroes around, collect various items/dynasty weapons for your hero's inventory as well as wood, ore, crystal, gold and fight neutrals. There are also various structures you can interact with which confer various bonuses, or grant units for your army etc.On this map there are various towns and forts which you fight to capture, and once captured you build up to allow you to recruit more units, higher level units or get bonuses for your battles.Battles involve moving stacks of units around on a grid, destroying enemy stacks in a variety of ways. There are a large variety of units in the game, roughly 7 types per faction - each with an upgraded version so really 14 per faction. Units often have special abilities, like being able to puppet enemy units to do your bidding, or charge through stacks slaughtering ally and enemy alike. All the factions have very different units so it never gets boring.In addition to units being moved around, your heroes can also use various abilities each turn, you can unlock more by spending skill points as you level up. There are loads of hero skills split in to Might types or Magic types, and these are futher classified into many sub-groups, too many to list here, but for instance for the Magic branch you have separate skill trees for Fire, Water, Light, Dark, Earth, Air, Prime (not all are accessible for each faction)Hero Dynasty weapons can also grant more abilities, as can items - many items come in sets (Diablo style) and wearing the full set can give you some very nice bonuses.There are Five factions in the main game (Haven, Inferno, Sanctuary, Stronghold, Necropolis), and a Sixth faction (Dungeon) in the expansion Shades of Darkness - which I also strongly recommend you get! Each faction has completely different units, different available skill trees, faction specific abilities, reputation abilities, different game play and look very different too.Sound and music in the game is awesome, the battle sound track is stuck in my head.Graphics are amazing too; the detail on the maps, on the units, structures, flora is great. Even the main menu has switchable themes - all of which are great (personal favourite is the dungeon one).The loading screens have some really nice drawings too, I had the Haven one as a wallpaper for some time.Units have really nice animations, and even have idle animations - Dungeon's Assassin starts spinning his daggers above his head like helicopter rotor blades and gets lifted off his feet and then drops down headfirst (all an animation - has no effect on gameplay..!), Vampires start playing rock music and using their swords as an electric guitar - really shocked me the first time it happened -""where is that rock music coming from..?""The storyline is amazing - I was eager to learn more just after the intro video!The game is split into many different campaigns - each campaign has up to 4 missions. The core game has one tutorial campaign, and then one campaign for each of the five core factions. The expansions add four more campaigns.The story is great but as the core campaigns all run simultaneously in the story chronology, it is possible to play one mission in one campaign and then ruin the story for yourself as you now know the outcome of another mission for another faction that you haven't played yet.I would recommend you play the Custom games and Campaign missions in the following order:Heart of Nightmares (Custom game accessed via the Custom game option in the main menu!), Prologue 1, Prologue 2, Stronghold 1, Sanctuary 1, Haven 1, Inferno 1, Necropolis 1, Stronghold 2, Sanctuary 2, Haven 2, Necropolis 2, Sanctuary 3, Stronghold 3, Inferno 2, Necropolis 3, Inferno 3, Sanctuary 4, Stronghold 4, Haven 3, Necropolis 4, Haven 4, Inferno 4, Epilogues, Pirates of the Savage Sea Campaign, Danse Macabre Campaign, Dungeon Campaign,  Necropolis Campaign 2.Maybe copy-paste that list into a text file somewhere and delete missions as you complete them!The only issue some people have, is with UPlay. Upon installing the game via Steam, you may have issues launching the game. Just install the latest Uplay off the Ubisoft site, see this link: http://steamcommunity.com/app/48220/discussions/0/45350245398257355/Another issue is that fighting neutrals can get repetitive as they are often so weak. Turn on Quick Battle in the options menu, and if you have a decent army, the battle will be resolved for you automatically.Gameplay tips - The Reinforcements skill is the key to victory in most scenarios early on- use it on stacks that are going to attack / get attacked and you will never have any losses from your main army.If you have other issues, just ask in the Steam Forum for the game, there are plenty of people that can help there!I'll say it again, I strongly recommend you play this game! Or you can just wait for Heroes of Might and Magic VII which is currently in development - can vote on factions to appear in the game etc on the developer's website!			"

												Reviews clearly don't mean anything to the Steam community because somehow this abomination keeps doing well in sales.If you're a fan of the Heroes of Might & Magic series, avoid this defecation of a 'game' at all costs, because it removes just about everything interesting and fun about the previous games and replaces it with a generic cut and dry style of play that robs the factions of their uniqueness and dumbs the game down into an extremely predictable, formulaic experience.If you're not a fan of the HoMM series, please, go and buy ANY OTHER Heroes game. If this is the first game in the series you play you'll probably wonder why they made 6 of them considering what an absolute piece of unfun trash this one is. I would recommend this to new players even less than I would to fans because at least fans might appreciate some small scrap buried deep down in the remains of what is now barely recognizable as HoMM.Oh, it's also horrendously buggy two years after release. It got I think 3 patches released before Ubisoft stopped supporting it and just started releasing DLC. This is nothing but a shameless cash grab, milking dry a classic franchise that could've had so much left to give if Ubisoft wasn't such a terrible company. They drove the original developers to bankruptcy and brought in a team of unknowns for a very short time after release to salvage the mess as much as they could - there were constant crashes and glitches that would totally halt your progress through a campaign mission and force a restart, and some of these persist to this day.And then there's the highly intrusive uPlay integration for those of you who dislike aggressive 3rd party DRM on your Steam games.Overall there is no reason for anyone to buy this game. If just one person sees this review and chooses not to give Ubisoft their money because of it, it was worth typing out.			"

												It could be the best Heroes of Might & Magic game until now. (Well, it's not)First of all, if you angry with this game, you shouldn't be. You should angry with Ubisoft and their game policies.When the game came for the first time, it was awful. But with time and updates it's quite better now. (Also, I'm still play HoMM 3 which is the best Heroes game.)Here are the pros and cons basicly (according to complete edition)Pros:- Might & Magic universe- Heroes III like town screens- Nice storyline- Gigantic maps and very long playtimes for hotseatCons:- UPlay- Conflux- Less ores and minerals, so it makes the game easier.Last word: They must remake HoMM III with this game engine. (Edit: They'll release HoMM III HD Edition, at least it's something.)			"

												Bought this game because I liked Heroes of Might & Magic V.Didn't encounter as many bugs as the other reviewers but that's probably because I didn't play campaign. I just played a normal Match to have some fun but I didn't have much fun.Why didn't I have much fun with this game?Because the KI sucks as hell. I was on an isle and had 3 castles there. Whenever I wanted to explore the map and go somewhere else an enemy came up to my isle with the aim to get my castles. So I teleported down to my castle and he ran away.So much so annoying. But I couldn't do anything from now on. Whenever I left the island to explore the map this mf came back to attack my castles and whenever I teleported back to the castle to get him he ran away.It was like a loop and so annoying that I haven't played this game since.

												For people that is looking to buy the game on today sale (75% discount, 7.49 EUR)As you can see from my play time, I did play this game (including all DLC).I played all games in the series since Heroes II and Heroes VI is far from being the best in the series (most players will agree that it was actually the worst so far). However I still did enjoy the game, and I do recommend the game, but only to people that are into this genre.Pros:- The HOMM feal is there.- The graphics are great.- The creatures and their abilities are highly enjoyable.- The game is now bug-free (this was not the case on release and for at least one year afterwards).- The Dinasty mechanics and related Hero weapons are a great addition.- You can easily see that the Hungarian developers put a lot of dedication and love into this project.Cons:- Ubisoft/Uplay integration. (Yes, it is true that their uptime is not the best and sometimes your ability to play will be limited).- Worst AI ever.- Too easy.- Too much grinding.- Unlike other Heroes games where you could actually lose, here you will never lose.To summarize. This game is not for everybody but if you have played HOMM games before and you enjoyed them, then you are probably going to enjoy also this one, despite its shortcomings.			"

I'm not entirely sure about that, because the game requires an Always On connection to some manner of server called Conflux. And even though my connection with the internet remains stable (as far as I can tell--everything else works), I repeatedly lose connection with Conflux. I just wanna play the ♥♥♥♥in' game.

												It's too dilluted.It lost the magic of the first games in the series.This instalment is similar to other recent ones : It's no longer a game about exploration, discovery, building, being heroic and enjoying a fantasy game. Now it feels like PACMAN, you start a map, and start COLLECTING ressources and things all over the place. I don't feel the strategy, or the tactics, or anything interesting or really fun. I suspect the only people who enjoy this game are the OCD ""gotta build everything and pick up everything"" types.You will spend hundreds of hours on this, then look back and can't recall a single memorable moment. Again, this is just a ""collect them all"" gathering game. It says turn based strategy game on the box, but there is no strategy. Also, it needs Uplay (ugh) and a constant internet connexion to use the so called ""Dynasty"" system. As always connexion is shaky and you lose progress because it can't always keep connexion to Dynasty.Not recommended.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I've played every single HoMM, and this one is the worst of the series in my opinion.First thing, Uplay... So many things wrong with this.. The fact that you're basically forced to be online, or miss part of  the game... Online saves can't be saved on your machine and so CANNOT be continued offline... Who's the incompetent fool who thought it was a good idea????Second, the AI... GOD THIS AI IS SO DUMB... I cast an ice storm on his ranged units, so for 3/4 turns, they will take dmg because the ai IS TOO DUMB TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY. Same with every kinda traps you can think of. AI have a very simple pattern in how they attack and move their troops, and the precense of traps or ice storms in my case doesn't change their strategy. A simple example. With haven, I left my sisters right behind 2 stacks of praetorians, but within range of the ai. Unapgraded sisters are useless yet the ai desperately tries to kill them. So he goes after the sisters, triggerring counterattacks from both praetorian stacks... resulting in a stupidily easy victory despite him outnumbering me 3 to 1...That brings me to the second issue, AI's only way to pose a challenge is he WILL outgrow you no matter what you do. Even with 5 bases to 1 he will get more units than you, because developpers somehow couldn't design a smart AI so they just went and made him grow large armies to simulate difficulty.Leading again to another problem. As a result, you cannot take your time to explore a map because you have to rush to defeat the ai before he does grow to large to have any hope of defeating... or in some maps you cannot afford to lose units in any battle cough *undead campaign* cough...My next  issue is more personnal, but I hate the new way you level your heroes and manage their spells and abilities. Really makes me feel like I have to grind my hero to get him the necessary abilities.The current factions feel also less unique. I guess they attempted to balance them out (with more or less success) but now they feel more or less the same.On the plus side, the story is rather interesting to follow, the graphics are good, and you can customize teams in multiplayer battles (and yes I hated that I couldn't make the teams in HoMM 5)My advice is, take your favourite previous version or HoMM and stick to playing that one. Bought this on a sale and now I'm regretting it.			"

												If you're new to the series and want to know why it has so many fans, go play HOMM5. It's a much better game. Or maybe try some of the older ones, they're pretty good and absolutely hold up in this day and age (the third one's even better than the fifth, if you ask some people).HOMM6 requires you to use Uplay in addition to Steam. This leads to a whole bunch of issues (Steam not tracking your playtime, game refusing to launch for this or that reason, you get the idea). It also introduces a weird element of meta-progression (called ""the Dynasty"", essentially a way to get incremental advantages by playing a lot of games. It offers some things like additional equipment and passive abilities for your heroes. Luckily, all this can be turned off in the skirmish mode). IMO, the meta-progression is an absolutely pointless and token addition to the game, as it adds no real depth. Pointless unlocks didn't make HOMM the venerable franchise that it is right now, it was the profoundness and quality of its gameplay that laid the foundation of its popularity.To add insult to injury, this one's essentially abandonware. The people behind the vanilla HOMM6 went bankrupt after the game's release, and Ubisoft passed development rights from one team to another before finally dropping all support for the game completely. As a result, HOMM6 is still kinda raw and incredibly buggy. Check the forums, there's a sticky thread with a list of major game-breaking bugs that you'll have to try and play around if you dare purchase this one. Personally, I haven't encountered any of those, but that may be just because I wasn't able to play the game for long. It simply stopped launching for me at one point, after hanging up on me for like three times in a row whenever I tried to save. Also, after uninstalling the game, I found a bunch of 1,5- to 3,5-gig files in my savegame folder. Yeah, the game basically crapped into my C drive as a final ""screw you"". The sad thing is that the game itself isn't terrible, really. Still, probably not worth your money. As I said earlier, go buy HOMM5 instead.			"

												It is not that much about Uplay's accessibility that I do not recommend the game. Actually, I played more of this game offline than online (mainly because for a long period of time after buying it, I had no regular access to internet from home), although Ubisoft implemented a punishment for doing so by not alowing you to collect rewards after finishing scenarios of the campaign. So yeah, always online is kind of mandatory and I think that is pretty lame.But I also have concerns about the game. Now Ok it is pretty and all there is no denying that, but there are some really bad design decisions in my opinion. For example, when you want to attack a enemy unit, you have to do it in one step, meaning that if for any reason you misclick and end up right in the square where you wanted to be but failed to issue the attack order, you cannot do it anymore. Another example is your hero who can cast spells and also attack, actions you have to take as long as one of your units still have the possibility to act; move all your units and that's it, your hero action is lost. I recently obtained a more stable internet connection and decided to get over with Uplay/always effing online but those ""features"" quickly annoyed/bored me.Otherwise, again, the game is good looking for sure, but it is also really different from the cult HOMM3 or the more than respectable HOMM5. Some would say ""overly simplified"" (aiming at a casual audience?) as the several resources of its elders are gone (now its just gold, wood, ore and a unique ""special"" one). The hero progression is also completely rehauled and despite not going into it too deeply (played like 20 hours offline and 2 hours online) it did not appeal to me so much I shall say, as again it seems to lack the diversity and options found in previous installement of the series.It is not a bad game (and I am happy I only wasted 75% of its price considering how little this episode of the franchise appeals to me - luckily I tried the demo and it only convinced me half-way so I waited for a sale) but it is far from having excellent game mechanics and in any way a good and contemporary implementation of the latter. I wished focus had been put more on making the game fun than on making it pretty to look at. Ultimately I wished Ubi's vision had been slightly less autoritarian, paranoid and business focused and a bit more into catering respectfully the heart of the gamers who contributed to make HOMM a great franchise by supporting it over more than 20 years.Most likely if you never played any previous iterations, this may still be a ""shiny"" introduction to the franchise as it certainly has the best graphics and accessibility. Veterans of the franchise though may be wary/reluctant to buy this one (although for most it is too late I guess) and maybe the next iteration ""VII"".			"

												Heroes VI has its problems: required internet connection to play, shoddy save syncing, and a long string of support patches that fix certain bugs while causing others.However, one thing alone will make Heroes VI a worthwhile purchase for many: Heroes VI is a love letter written by the develoeprs to the fans of the golden days of the Heroes franchise (1, 2, and 3). A plethora of small details in this game recall the older titles that Heroes fans fell in love with. Just to list a few: they've brought back some of the best of the old musical scores, done away with the worst (although sadly not all) of the shoddy gameplay elements of 4 and 5, and they've even included a Heroes 6 version of one of the most iconic Heroes maps ever created: Broken Alliance.Long story short, if you've never played a Heroes of Might and Magic game in your life, then the flaws with this game may make it more frustrating to you than it's worth. But if you're a die hard Heroes fan yearning for the glory days, and you're willing to put up with a few bugs, this game is a real gem.			"

												I have played this game for a long time in the campaigns and they are hard as all hell. Seems like the devs have copied most of the pages of the Bad Gameplay Manual. Forget making your own unique hero in the campaigns, unless you spec them very specifically and very carefully then it's close to impossible to beat the missions.As side for the super cheating AI with it's heros respawning with full armies, the game is rather good. Has some good features and nice visuals. It also feels less cluttered unlike its older cousins in the HoMM series. I think they recycled the music from HoMM V though as I feel as if I have heard every track before.But my issue is and remain the super cheater AI and the lack of creative freedom in the campaigns and possibly custom games thus why I will not be recommending this game to anyone. Want a great HoMM experience then get HoMM 3. It is easily the best one in the series.			"

												I tried really hard to like this game, but in the end there is just no way I can.  For me, Heroes 5 was the pinnacle of the series and every step 6 takes is a step backwards in my opinion.  Here are the 5 biggest problems I have:1. The AI programming completely ruins the game.  In the single player campaign, the AI does not play with the same rules or even close to the same rules as the player.  Every creep monster it encounters runs from it, which allows it to pillage everything on the map as quickly as it can walk to it.  It also doesn't actually build its cities up.  It starts with a predefined city build and just gets flooded with many times more troops per week than the player gets.  Additionally, defeated AI heroes respawn with very large armies.  This forces you to rush through every map as quickly as possible because the longer you give the AI, the exponentially more numerous his army becomes.  Its rate of growth is far beyond what you can keep up with.2. The skill system is awful.  Every hero has some base stats and beyond that, they are all otherwise exactly the same since every hero can be trained in any skill you want.  Have a warrior?  Spend your skill points and turn him into a spell caster.  Have a wizard?  Spend some skill points and make him the strongest warrior on the map.  It's silly.3.  You can convert towns to different factions.  Some people surprisingly like this, but its actually just a bandaid to help compete with the terribly unbalanced/poorly scripted AI.  Yes, with just a few ore, wood and gold, you can convert any town of any faction to your faction.  Just like magic, instantly.  Again, it's just stupid.4.  The campaigns aren't really campaigns.  You can bounce around between campaigns mission by mission and ironically have to in order to actually follow the story chronologically.  It basically kills any attempt to keep a coherent story line going.5.  It has 2 additional layers of DRM.  Uplay is bad enough, but the Heroes 6 ""Conflux"" always on internet connection requirement is just too painful to bear since half the time it doesn't even connect.  There are plenty of times where you can't play the game because the conflux servers are down.All in all, the game is a nice looking, shallow disaster.  Avoid this like syphillis.			"

												So, I finally got around to giving this game another go seeing how reviews for HOMM7 were tanking, and the reviews for this game had actually improved over time. HOMM games in general are, after all, great, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that UPlay finally allowed me to start an Ubisoft game. Its taken many years - when was this game released? - since I have had a trouble free start to an Ubisoft game - for these same reasons, I rarely buy from this developer. Anyhow, it was a fun few hours, but I saved up and went to bed. Tonight; no saves. Hard to say why. I've tried creating new games, make saves, quit, reload - all gone. I believe the fix to this is changing UPlay so that it is in offline mode, however, if I right click UPlay in the system tray and go to settings, it tells me ""UPlay has detected an unrecoverable error and must shut down!"". Every.single.time. Seriously? We can finally play our games after.... 5 years?! It only took you 5 years to make your DRM launcher work and now it eats all of your save progress instead? FFS Ubisoft, get your affairs in order!Also, the Conflux - an in game message board where people can write things on various posts at different locations on maps, is up there with worst ideas in the history of gaming. I don't understand if Ubi intended for it to be used for people to post how to 'beat' maps, or just to swear at each other or about the dev - if so, mission accomplished - but it adds nothing useful to the game other than forcing an otherwise unnecessary always online function, which is really the core problem with the whole game - unless you are playing multiplayer, there is no reason to necessitate going through all of the rubbish with the UPlay DRM which breaks even the single player experience - I can't imagine it would actually be successful in connecting a multiplayer match for the duration of a game.

The AI is stupid and cheats, gameplay is very dumbed down from previous iteration it is getting very boring. You can transform the town to any faction you want therefore cut down the strategy and prioritizing and developing some town types meaningless. No random maps generator and therefore poor replay value. Game is also quite buggy. The only redeaming value is the nice art style. overall an very mediocre attempt to revive a great serie. 4/10.

Got Price of Loyalty and did the same. Was enthralled by the masterpiece known as Heroes III and all of its expansions. Figured out the puzzle that was Heroes IV, New World Computing's last contribution to the franchise. Suffered through Nival's inability to create copetent map AI in Heroes V. And now this game, which I cannot truly comment on, because the ""double layer"" of DRM through Steam and Ubisoft renders this game unplayable. Really, it's Ubisoft's fault because U(don't)play always crashes regardless if I install from steam or fresh form the website or wherever. I can't even log on without the interface crashing. So really, this is a review on how bad Uplay is. It breaks everything. Thank goodness it's a digital download instead of back in the day, when garbage DRM would forever ruin your disk drives.

I played a couple games in a row where I was riding high on an army of literally every unit I could possibly build and the game decided to drop an AI hero with at least 3 times the units.

												Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a turn-based strategy game from Ubisoft Entertainment. It is another installment in Might & Magic franchise.Might & Magic: Heroes VI has kinda unique gameplay, you start with one castle, develop it, build a barracks, train troops in a turn-based gameplay, but to move your troops around you will need a hero. When you move your hero and the troops he command around, you can engage random enemy, found resources or found something that may upgrade your heroes, increase experience or even someone to join your troops. When engaged in battle, you will enter the battlefield view where you will play the battle in a chess like gameplay. It's kinda fun. But in terms of hardcore strategy play, well, this game is not that hard. In fact even though you can create many heroes, using only one hero is enough to win the game.Might & Magic: Heroes VI graphics are good, not great but good. The detail and the model and texture are beautiful enough. The performance of the game are also good, and the game runs smooth and stable without any issues.Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a good game that if you like turn-based strategy game, Might & Magic: Heroes VI can occupy you for many hours. I recommend this.Rating 7/10			"

												Requiring an always online DRM, still unfinished after years of development, MMH6 is a prime example how NOT to develop  & manage games within a renown franchise. It was given to a cheap developer with zero experience only to be given to someone else because of all the f**k-ups including bugs causing disappearing online rewards, swapping of all achievements with your opponent and the like.This game is the single reason why I will never again buy an Ubisoft game on release (and even at a 75% discount, I still hesitate). It left a sour taste in my mouth back when it was released, ruining one my favourite franchises of all time.  "

												After over 100 hours of playing this game, but yet to be done, I think it's time to write about this game.First of all. I have been playing heroes of might and magic since Heroes 2, and I think that they are one of the best games I've been following through my life. Good memories and good stories!Well first I wanna talk about how you are gonna start playing this game, as it's not just simply to click the game and start it. First of all you gotta make an account for uplay, which gives you a few ""presents"" if you play the game enough. It is also saving your save into a cloud using this program. After saving ""save password and log in automaticly"" you won't see much more of this problem, as the game will enter as you click the Heroes 6 icon.Now at the menu screen you see a whole lot of buttons! Confusing? Ye, a bit maybe. Some of it are related to social stuff, like skype, while there is also a store you can buy different titles, icons and heroes + some abillities for your hero. The important reason for Uplay here is that you can go to a page: http://heroes-6-conflux.us.ubi.com/soulforge to upgrade weapons, and litterary do the same thing as ingame, except the weapons part.So so far you have: Made uplay account, seen the store, seen the page where you can upgrade weapons.Phew! Now that that is written, lets take a look at the game.The first I realised is how much time it takes for each level to load. It is pretty slow, but I'll guess you gotta live with it. The levels are also quite big, but I'll take that after I've talked about a very known problem. As I played the first level and got into a fight, everything went black...and this problem occured to me over and over and over and over again, until I made it a common thing to quicksave after every single battle. Luckily I found a solution online for my nvidia graphic card that recommended you to go into the controll panel (for nvidia graphic card), 3D setup and pick the game. Then put the option so you only pick the Nvidia graphic card. I have a laptop, so it shows two graphic cards. Click the named graphic card, and not the integrated one.As we have now solved everything we can finally play! The game got huge magnificant levels, with lots of nice music, sounds and hours on hours to play the game. In the previous games of heroes 6 there might have been alot more levels per campain, which for me made it easier to play. These campain levels are huge, and even the tutorial level will require a few hours to get through.Heroes are also built point by point, through a skill tree. Kinda good idea, but really different from the earlier games. I am not sure if I liked it that much in the start, but it got better as you learnt it. Towns are almost the same as before, and the gameplay is pretty much the same. As I now have played through 4 campains I can say that the story and campains are really good. You follow the story about Duke Slavas ""children"", and all of them got an affliction with one of the different playable teams that heroes 6 offers. I think that's kinda cool, because every team is different and every hero got their own story. As the teams are different you will allways have to play a different way with them. You can also pick might or magic afflication, which means you will excell in one of them (Might = can use armor, Magic = more items for a mage).I said earlier that the gameplay was mostly the same, but there is a huge difference. The way of telling the story this time is chatboxes, with dialogue. This works really nice, and makes you able to follow the history when you finish of tasks/quests/missions to do, and move on. I feel the AI, even on normal can be a bit dumb, and can sometimes feel like it's pretty easy to win. There was one level I remember that I spent a few days on to complete, but it was the layout of it, that made it hard, and the fact that the enemy had so much more than me.The last thing I am gonna talk about is dynasty weapons. You find them in different campain levels and you can upgrade em from level 1-5 either using your hero (getting experience for the weapon), and level it like that, or use the link I put in the start of this. If you use the page it takes 10 minutes (level 2), 1 hour (level 3), 24 hours (level 4) and 2 weeks to complete level 5. I would recommend levelling a weapon if you plan to use it on a character. It goes faster, than the two weeks.ANYWAY! The game has been great, all though it takes up alot of time to complete. Some things are new and you just got to get used to it. Eventually you will, after spending so much time on it. Would recommend playing on normal, which should be suitable for most people. Enjoy the game, and please like this recommandation if you feel it's good.P.S. Still got 3 campains for the main game, 2 DLCs and the expansion pack left, so I am far from done, but what is written here is what thoughts I've had so far.			"

												I've played every entry of the Heroes of Might and Magic series (except VII, but I'll explain that momentarily), and I wanted so badly to like this one. Since people seem to respond well to the pros/cons list, I'll use that format.Pros:-The single player campaign is reasonably fun. It has some frustrating moments, but overall the missions are at least enjoyable, if not particularly original. The cut scenes are best skipped though.- In all the previous games, there was an element of chance to skill gain, while in this game you can customize your heroes' skills freely. This does tend to reduce the variety of skills used, but it takes out some of the irritation of not getting a skill that you consider vital to your hero.- Combat is similar to all the previous games, but with significantly expanded creature abilities, which I like. Rather than just attack-attack-attack, there are options for using most creatures in a secondary role. I'm not a huge fan of the square combat grid (as opposed to hexes), but it's not terrible, just not ideal.- Graphics and animations are quite a bit better than previous games. Not that graphics are a vital feature in a turn-based strategy game, but it's nice little side feature.Cons:- Multiplayer does not work. I know people will say ""oh, have you tried ____?"" Yes. I have tried whatever you were going to suggest. It does. Not. Work. I even opened a ticket with Ubisoft support, and after several weeks of trying everything they suggested, I never succesfully joined or hosted a multiplayer game. It doesn't matter how fun the single player is, Heroes is a game to be played with other people.- Ubisoft went ahead and released Heroes VII before fixing this game, and (surprise surprise) it had the exact same connection issues as this game, plus some all new game breaking bugs. As I said, I didn't actually play VII, but you can go read the reviews for it and they will almost all cite some comparison to the broken status of VI. As of the end of 2016, VII has also been abandoned and will never be patched.I realize that it looks like the pros outweigh the cons in my list, since the pros are all in-game features, and the cons are out-of-game problems with Ubisoft. Regardless, my recommendation is to avoid this game, and all future releases from Ubisoft. One thing is for sure, I will absolutely not be purchasing another game from them until they stop releasing broken, buggy games that never get fixed. Ubisoft does not deserve my money, or yours, or anyone else's for that matter.			"

												While not as good as its predecesor, this is still a really fun game. The graphics are unparalleled by most of today's strategy games, and the pacing is very good. There are plenty of missions, as well as DLC to keep you occupied. Thing is, there's not enough in this game to dignify playing this over some other games. If you have some time on your hands, this game could really be fun.Oh, and the online multiplayer sucks.Like, really bad.Waiting for people to finish their turns, without the screen really doing anything, is just one of the most boring experiences I have ever endured in a video game.

												The Good:- Interesting unit abilities.- Good art styles for each faction.- Plays like every other HoMM game.- AI is pretty good.The Bad:- Requires UPlay to run. So you'll need to create a UPlay account and be dependant upon the UPlay service being active and operational.- Each faction's campaign is not ""in story order"", so you'll need to jump between different faction missons. These aren't clearly laid out, so you'll need to search online for the ""correct order"". This really frustrated me as the campaigns have their own story line but cross over at points and there's no indication on which campaign/mission to play next to continue to story line.- I experienced some bugs, but nothing game breaking.Summary:If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise, then get this. Otherwise, you can skip this one. "

												If you're either a Heroes franchise fan or just turn a based strategy genre fan, you better avoid this one. As others have already stated, the game is extremely buggy. Even more than two years after the initial release. You don't necessarily have to run into a showstopper bug very often, but even then, the level design throughout all the campaigns is pretty horrendous. You're often forced to just skip turns in order to build strong enough an army to defeat a final opponent, who is, btw, just passively waiting in his own castle. The story isn't written badly, but the overall experience is worse than Heroes V and not anywhere near its predecessors.Lastly, the game isn't very well optimized. It doesn't look bad, but for what you get, it actually demands way more than it should off of your PC. The framerate can very often drop pretty low even on today's high-end machine. To sum up, do not buy this game unless you're a huge fan of the series who doesn't want to miss on the developments in the story.			"

												OK, I'm fed up with this game, seriously! I played HoMM 3-4 and loved them both because those were playable and enjoyable games. HoMM 6 isn't!1., I've never understand why in the love of God the developers restrict you from playing? I mean why the hell I'm forced to play through the two boring tutorials to be able to play the real campaigns?! I don't care about the griffin-♥♥♥♥ knights I bought a game which consist more than 6 or 8 campaigns, why force me to playthrough you ♥♥♥♥in tutorial campaign and restrict me from the real ones until I finish the completely uninteresting, unmotivated tutorial campaign?!?!? Restricting gamers and not allow them to play how they want is the most ♥♥♥♥ed up thing by designing a game!2., This game is worse than HoMM 4, no matter on what difficulty you play, everytime you left your castle and leave you weakest units behind and prepare to attack with full force on the final enemy, the AI brings up some medium/small army and starts to capture your mines, barracks etc., and due to the movement points in many cases you are not able to reach it's army to stop this madness, and your army which you left home is not as strong as your main forces, so you are ♥♥♥♥ed up, you can reload your game because it's an endless cycle.3., Why Uplay? Sometimes Uplay updates then Conflux is not available and there you go, you can't play!4., On nVidia cards you have to ""hack"" or lower your graphic settings to prevent random freezes before tactical battles, no matter how strong card you have.These are the first impressions by playing only the ♥♥♥♥in tutorial campaigns on normal and even on easy because of the unfair AI unit spawn. Yes, I remember HoMM 4 was similar in that case but it wasn't as heavy as in HoMM 6. You can imagine how good this game is according to the first 10 hours which was only the ""basic"" tutorial campaign. To hell with this game, to hell with Ubisoft and well, Black Hole guys, I'm sorry, but you failed too, no matter how hard you tried to create something new. You owe me 19 Euros and 10 hours of my life!Gamers who like 4X fantasy strategy, go play Age of Wonders 3, Disciples, Fallen Enchantress or King's Bounty, the Heroes franchise is dead. There are tons of other great 4X strategy games out there, it's time to release HoMM to it's grave and get a grip of something new and good franchise.			"

												Maybe I haven't played this long enough for glitches to actually come out, but there is another thing that broke the game for me. I'm HOMAM veteran and I've spend countless hours on third one, some time with fifth and I wasn't prepared for this.What it is? Difficulty. I wasn't able to finish first level of this game. I've completed tutorial campaign without any problems, then after playing first mission for two hours, I've realized I just can't win against AI player that suddenly appeared with army three times big that I had. I wasn't feeling like wasting two hours on every try, which is very nice if you're a game designer and you want to make your game feel incredibly longer, but it's abysmal if you're just a simple player. So I went to steam forums and found out that every mission is pretty much meant to be played one of two ways, and if you do anything else, you won't make it.And that's why I've stopped playing. I've actually liked how game's story continued, it was nice and well put together. Graphics are decent, soundtrack too and overall, I would be gladly playing the game, if it wasn't for this crippling difficulty. Their idea was to make few levels, but as difficult as possible. This is truly for hardcore players, or I'm just an incompetent  dumbass, which is possible, but after research I've done, I'm convinced that I might be too dumb to play this game, but it's definetely ridiculously hard.

Required to make a ubiplay account upon startup, but the servers are consistently down. Their webpage is still up, still active, you're able to make an account there, but it requires you to download and use a Uplay system, which is Ubisoft's gaming platform.  Ok done.  Finally it asks you for double-verification, and wants to you download a googleplay ap on your phone, to use the double verification feature.All to play a game purchased on the steam platform.Refund denied.

												Not a bad Heroes game, all things considered.  I'm not entirely certain how I feel about them homogenizing all of the rare resources into one.I like that you can now specialize your hero in any direction you want, but I'm not a huge fan of the talents that they give you.  They don't see as fun as part 5's.Still a solid game, pretty fun to play, interesting teams.  I wish that you had 2 choices of upgrade for each unit like they did for Heroes 5. Unforunately their online service is a nightmare and I have yet been able to get a group of 4 into one game.  There's always an issue where 1 player cannot join a game, and that excluded player changes based on who is hosting.  Player 1 can't join Player 2's game, Player 4 can't join Player 2's game and so on and so forth.			"

Compared to Heroes 5, which I played hundreds upon hundreds of hours before the days of steam.... this game is simply silly in terms of AI balance. It's like the AI is like 'oh hey you have 2 more soldiers than the other AI team, gg AI green team, you get their base for free, now go ♥♥♥♥ the player'..... and yes, I had it on easy because it was my third playthrough, normal I got rinsed before a month was past by a AI that apparently could recruit everything known to man on his way to my base since day one.

												This review is written with players of previous games in the series (III and/or V specifically) in mind. If you haven't played those before, I'd recommend playing either of them instead, as I feel they are both significantly better games.First and foremost, the game runs pretty poorly for me. I have an Nvidia card, so I have to work around the game to stop it from freezing every second time I enter a battle. Even with the workaround of changing the priority and CPU affinity (which I have to do every time I boot the game, unless I want to revert to an old GPU driver just for this one game), I still get the occasional freeze, mostly when attacking castles. The loading times are long and annoying, to the point where there's actually a loading screen the first time you enter a town. It takes a good 5-10 seconds of blackscreen to load a castle fight, while other fights barely load at all for whatever reason. Granted, I don't have an SSD, but really...Skills and spells aren't random, instead you choose 1 ability or spell to add or upgrade. The amount of skills rivals V's skill and sub-skill system, but there are far, far fewer spells (since you can only pick 1 per level, instead of just visiting a mage guild).Units are pooled, so you can buy units from anywhere in your kingdom in any castle or fort that has access to the appropriate dwelling. Towns also have buildings that allow you to teleport to other towns by casting a spell, with some restrictions. Sounds good, but it leads to (at least against AI) stacking all your units on 1 hero and simply bulldozing through everything, because you can always just teleport to any castles that need defending. To add on to that, you can convert dwellings, castles, and forts to your faction, meaning a Necropolis player can convert a Dungeon castle into a Necropolis by paying resources and sacrificing buildings that can't be converted. Because of these things, you're going to end up having massive armies on 1 hero in pretty much every (PvC) game, which is extremely boring.The number of resources has been cut down; there is now only Gold, Wood, Ore, and Crystal, where Crystal is the rare substance and the other three are as they are in previous games. It leads to less situations where, for example, a Stronghold in III doesn't have the crystal to get cyclops or behemoths, hamstringing them. It does make everything feel samey, though, with resource costs practically the same across the board.Castles and forts have a zone of control around them. What this does is prevent enemy heroes from taking any dwellings or mines within their zone unless that hero stays put at that building. So no more annoying heroes running through and taking all your mines and dwellings while you're away. Hurray! It does pretty clearly telegraph who owns a castle nearby, though, since you can see a big blob of their colour on the minimap representing the zone.Towns are also structured a lot differently. There are almost no prerequisites in the manner that there are in III and V; you just need a certain level town hall for most of them. There are no more Tier 1 - Tier 7 creature dwellings; instead there are 3 tier 1 (called ""core""), 3 tier 2 (called ""elite""), and 1 tier 3 (called ""champion""), and none of the dwellings are required to build any other dwellings. All towns have the same dwellings (though obviously with different units for the faction), town hall, fortifications (which only increase creature growth by 1 instead of 50/100% like in previous games), the marketplace, the previously mentioned portal buildings, the ultimate building which is equivalent to the Grail or Tear of Asha building from previous games, and a hall of heroes for hiring heroes plus its upgrade to resurrect them. Literally the only difference between factions' towns is two unique buildings (a tier 2 and a tier 3), each of which has two possible options. There's usually one with an effect that works in the town's control zone and one that's global; the tier 2 generally improves the faction's unique ability, and the tier 3 is generally something strong that fits the theme of the faction.Heroes also (by default; you can speed it up for non-campaign games) seem to level really slowly, which really hampers the game, since your spells are directly tied to your level in addition to regular old abilities. I might not have looked hard enough at exactly how fast you level, but it at least feels a lot slower.Unit speeds in battles are almost the same across the board; melee and flying units can generally move across the board in 2 turns with few exceptions, and without even looking it up I honestly doubt there's a unit in the game with a speed under 5 (the size of a normal field, for reference, is 12 wide and 10 high) and I doubt there are many, if any, with a speed above 8. There just aren't slow units like Dendroids or Zombies or wicked-fast units like Archangels that can cover massive ground even when slowed. As mentioned before, creatures are split up into 3 tiers instead of 7, meaning all factions have 3 creatures with similar stats, 3 stronger creatures with similar stats, and then their truly unique top-tier creature. Just like towns, creatures often feel samey.They also went back to the III style of turns (as opposed to V) in part; units with the highest Initiative go first (Initiative and Speed are split like in V, meaning the unit that can travel furthest doesn't also automatically go first), and each unit gets one action in the round, unless they get good morale, which gives them an immediate second turn with reduced speed, damage, and the inability to use abilities. I'm pretty indifferent to this, but I feel like V's system of not having 'rounds' has more potential and variety available.Like in V, each faction has a unique ability they can use in battle. They each charge up in a different way and have a different function. Necropolis can resurrect troops (surprise!), and the ability is charged up when units (enemy or friendly, though friendly charge it faster) take damage, while Sanctuary can buff their units' stats and charge by attacking any unit that hadn't already been attacked in the round.There's also boss fights and other unique encounters with special fields or conditions. So far I've played 2 non-tutorial campaign missions to the end, and both had a unique fight at the end. In one, you control a boss fighting against a massive army. I happened to be playing on the hardest difficulty for this, which made that army really massive, to the point where I just gave up, since a little bit of bad luck or an imperfect move could easily turn the battle to a loss just like that. In the other, you have a certain number of turns to kill a massive army of units that all have No Enemy Retaliation and Strike & Return. I know, fun. This one was pretty easy after I took a practice attempt to figure it out.Random maps. They're not in the game. At all. And there aren't even a whole lot of custom game maps, either. It's sad. I'd even take V's pretty bad random generator over none. Really disappointing.Then there's the Dynasty. There a meta progression thing going on, where you earn passive abilities, weapons, and things like that by playing the game. Naturally, these things only work when you're online, and only when you're *always* online. I don't know how strict it is, but I do know that one time I started a map, disconnected a few seconds in, and was promptly booted from the game. Not simply disabling the Dynasty, seeing as I'm not playing against other people and so it likely doesn't matter if they're enabled or not. Kicked from my own player vs. computer game; that type of behaviour doesn't typically endear a person to a game.It also requires Uplay.If you don't have Heroes III or V, get one of those instead. If you absolutely need more Heroes, I'd recommend getting II or perhaps even IV or I after that.			"

												This game was a dismal follow-on in a game series that has been degrading since Heroes III. I can't imagine why they would have removed random maps and replayability. And what did they give in exchange? I couldn't find anything other than graphical improvements. The 3rd party developers who remade II and III did a better job that the AAA's at trying to revive this once lovable series.			"

												I've been playing Heroes a long, LONG time. The games scratch that wonderful itch i get for a tactical RPG but in a western setting and normally do a great job of hitting the balance between tactical thinking and forward planning but with a lot of the fanbase, we noticed a lot was up when the brand name changed from ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" to ""Might and Magic : Heroes"", a change that made no sense. This whole trend - Changing of the brand - follows it through the whole game. From simple changes like how the battles play out to multiplayer being a ""create your own hero"" rather then having a list of heroes. It feels like less work was put into this game, just to test the waters to see if people cared. It's a little hard to explain what went wrong. First off, the story is set BEFORE the heroes 5 game (a game i really rather enjoyed) which means not a lot of the events are really explained outside of ""AND THIS COULD MEAN STUFF LATER"", with some rather dull line-reads and the Haven once again being kinda just used as ""We totally are good guys, but..."", the lack of effort in the story keeps the story going for far far too long and by the time you are doing anything considered fun, you are passed bored. Have i mentioned the bugs? 2 years. No patches outside of basic ones. The game STILL forces me into offline mode. It says i've played 1.7 hours but im over 100 hours. I wanted with all my heart to like the multiplayer but after a while, it just gets boring when my heroes skills are chosen by me. I like random for a reason. :( Just...skip it. Sales be damned.			"

The fun parts of homm are virtually non-existent, and the annoying parts are now the main part of the game.

When I finally got that to run properly (It crashed every time until I found some information), I discovered that my CD-Key could no longer be used since it was ""already claimed"".I purchased my key on steam in 2011 and started playing shortly after. I'm not sure where along the way I 'lost ownership'.  The extra kick in the teeth was the uplay application crashing after informing me I could not use my key.I'm waiting on a response from customer support, but I'm not optimistic.Seriously was a great game, but if you have to worry about losing access to it and having a terrible launcher, it's not worth it.

												This game is complete fail. No playable balance in single player skirmish (not the campain mode), hero primary skills not working properly (physical and magic attack and defence), complete racism (if you play HMM 3 you'll see that mix from 2 towns are more effective than just yours but even than you able to choose - in HMM 6 no choice avalible), too low max level cap... The list of fails is too long for this topic.     I advise all players to try Heroes of Might and Magic III (or King's Bounty series)  - there you will see the great game mechanics and exellent balance between towns.    Too sad that for 15 years no one developer didn't learn anything from old school heroes - greed and hunger for glory are bad friends and advisors.  11.30.2013 i've tested HMM VI Shades of Darkness - game balance still 0: too many small numbers of buffs and debuffs make solo game without Ubisoft ""Conflux"" and bonuses from dynasty imposible - AI cheating too much (even know how to intercept you when you don't expect it). So my recomendation still true. In general - too many artwork (units has very good view) but no game mechanics, no HMM potential (combined forces from other towns, no working stats (example: vampire under your command do less and receive more dmg then under AI command - even your physical attack and defence equal to AI opponent), useless skills, teaching magic for skill points, level cap 30), P.S. I don't know who's responsible for this DLC...don't waste your money.P.P.S. Buy King's Bounty game series - much more fun and true legacy of HMM III (especially new one: Warrior of the North).			"

												There seem to be a lot of mixed reviews on this game. If you loved Heroes 5, you'll probably like this one as well, but I can see why some of the die hards would complain. Pros:-It's Heroes. I've played the incarnations of this game since the original, and have enjoyed every version (except for 4, seriously what were they thinking). -Every creature has a special ablility. I like that, because it means if you only have low level guys, you can still use stratagy to outwitt a larger army.-There's a bunch of new creatures to explore.-All of the town types are evenly matched. I found in the previous games Necromancers (my favorite) had generally weaker monsters compared to other towns, but would make up for it with numbers as you fought. The Necromancy skill has changed in this one so you don't mass up a swarm of skeletons from your enemy's corpses, but your army can hold it's onw anyway.Cons:-U-Play. I've never liked using U-Play, and this game is the best example of why. Aside from the bulky and unecessary U-Play shell that runs, you have to have a connection to their server to access most of the game. Also, if you're not connected, you can't access any of your saved games. And most annoying is the autosave. I found that after about two weeks of in game play, my computer would bog down to the point of freezing the game. I was able to fix the problem by not allowing the auto save, but that means I have to save my game myself often.-Skills. I honestly don't know what I don't like about the new level up skills format, but something about it rubs me the wrong way. I do like that you have to earn your spells by leveling up, but there is something about the new system that just feels .... blah.-Enemy Heroes are really tough. In a custom map, you can spend a couple hours building up your castle and hero. You'll find that the random map monsters are fairly easy to dispatch, but then an enemy hero will show up. ""Holy Crap, where'd he get that army from?"" or ""How did he vaporize my stack of creatures with that one lightning bolt?"" I find them wickedly powerful. The campaign though, which I havn't yet finished, seems much easier.-You really only need one hero. You beef up one guy and go smashing. If an enemy is sneeking up on your castle, no problem, just use your town gate spell and you're home. It's also too easy to get your hero back every time. While I get nobody wants to loose their big main hero, I find this takes away the stratagy of defense for your castles.Overall, I do enjoy the game and would suggest it to anyone, both fans of the series and newcomers alike!

												Well... I enjoyed playing the first three titles of the series, and was looking forward to reenjoying it with modern day graphics during the fights. What I got was nice for the first start, playing a little bit, but then I had that Nvidia graphics bug, and since them I'm only able to play with minimum details. A disappointment to say at least, I thought I still might give it a try, and started to play the single player campaing. There, you play nicely, until you find that you seriously can't beat the opponent, since he constantly has more units than you, generates them quicker (even if you conquer his spawn buildings outside his castle), and then you figure you can't beat him. That's when I quit playing. Now I'll uninstall it and see another 10€ fly out the window. If this would have been a boxed game I would be considering sending it back for a refund...			"

												I am a HUGE fan of the entire Might & Magic series of games and have played every single one of them.  The Heroes of Might & Magic (HOMM) games definitely represent a dated turn-based playstyle that is not for everyone and also seems very hard to improve upon which is why I think each new HOMM game release basically mimics the previous version although with better graphics and a few tweaks here and there.  Heroes VI unfortunately does have a few issues:- The computer AI just isn't challenging even when played at the toughest level.  - Game crashes are problematic.  A common one I come across fequently occurs when in combat agains griffins and they try to use their special attack.  At one point after a crash I was simply unable to load any saved game period even after re-installing the game and was forced to start from the beginning again.- Although not technically an issue, I have a strong dislike to having to log into both Steam and UPlay in order to play this basically single player based game!

												It's a good game. Doesn't hold a candle to Heroes M&M 5, but it can hold up on it's own. Biggest gripe I have with this game is the Always On DRM. If your internet gets a little hick-up, the game quits (even in mid battle), doesn't save your progress and exit's you to the main menu. This is extremly bothersome. I dont think I ever finished a game session without getting booted out of this game.  Even though I bought this game, I am seriously considering Pirating it, so I can continue playing without getting disconnected all the time.  Save youself the trouble and get Heros 5 instead. More content, more factions, better spells and skill tree. AND NO STUPID DRM!!!!			"

												Great game, the AI is really challenging and the hot seat feature is, as always, amazing. I didn't not finish the campaign, the story isn't really immersive...Unfortunatly... you need to be on U-Play to acces the game or else, you can't save your progress.This is the only bad feature of the game. U-Play is really killing Ubisoft games. But if you don't play when any major game launch or any major problem with U-Play server happens, you will be fine. So I recommend this game, even if U (don't) Play is needed to play with all of this game feature.			"

												The game itself is good. However, do not buy this simply due to the complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is the Uplay launcher... I bought the original game when it was released and activated the CDkey on Uplay. It played fine. However, the troubles arose when my PC had to be redone due to a virus. When I tried to get back on this game the cd key was apparently ""Used by another account"" when I have no other account. After some research, it seems people have this same problem, so I am not only stopped from playing this wonderful game due to Uplay, but also lost a good £30.00 because of it (I got Shades of Darkness before trying to replay it).The game? 7-8/10. The means of being able to play it? 1/10.			"

												Attention: BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME, be advised: it is severely bugged for Nvidia systems and developers have not solved this issue which is standing since 2012. The bug crashes the game or makes screen black when opening town screen or starting a battle.I advise you to buy it only if: - You have a non-Nvidia video card- The game is on a cheap sale- You save often and don't mind restarting the game every time it crashes.- You are a die-hard fan (but in this case I'm sure you would have already bought it before)If you love this type of games, try Heroes of Might and Magic V, it doesn't have the severe crash bugs and it's even more fun than the VI.

But once again I regret buying something that you have to use U(Don't)Play with. Currently I tried to start playing it again for single player, as the multiplayer is just broken.

												This game is piece of crap. Some people do not like it due to forcing Uplay on to their heads, but for me it is not the reasonPros: Has beutiful battle fields and greatly animated creatures.Cons: Lacks most of the creatures that I loved, or they are changed and are not the same as before (Dwarfs, crussaders). Castle design is horible without and with DLC, some of them are missing (rampart, tower) and some are only unlocked via DLC (dungeon), Human castle is based solely on religion and other ones on some boring nonsense. Senitel's shield has Poland's coat of arms on it instead of clasical griffin, some of the heroes names are russian (Anton, which means Anthony in English), There are ONLY 3 RESOURCES INSTEAD OF 7: wood, stones and blood crystals. This thing doesn't even have a map editor! . There's even more, but I alredy tired from writing.To sum things up: This part of heroes sucks, go get 5th or 3rd instead			"

												If you are a fan of Heroes 3 or turn based strategy game, this is a must get.Story Plot : 9/10 All stories linked to each other and working towards revealing the mastermind @ final campaignNew feature: Dynasty weapon & traits adds more spice to the game, i wish there are more dynasty weapons!High replay value: Once you clear the campaign, you will be wondering about how to clear the campaign again with opposite choices (i.e. Might vs Magic, Blood vs Tears). You will be want to use your favourite race to re-play at higher difficulty level and/or single scenarios.Character development: Experimenting with talents trees and controlling multiple heroes of different talents as the story progress keeps me addicted to the gameDownside:    - Might and Magic is not really balance, which steers many players towards playing just the stronger side. Same goes to Tears vs Blood.   - Requires UPlay active connection [I've not been able to play the game due to UPlay server down which is frustrating]   - Still some bugs which are not fixed till now (eg. max level magic heroes are suppose to summon 22 Earth Elementals but it's down to 12 if you spec Earth Magic)Conclusion:   Overall is enjoyable and especially with 8USD promo price now, you don't even have to ponder!

There are multiple expansions for this game and I got all of them from the start. I then after downloading the whole game AND then getting Uplay, could not activate the 3 dlc's and was restricted to two factions that are in the base game.See I recall the glory days of heroes 3 a timeless game indeed as I stated before, get the older heroes games off GOG.comhttp://www.gog.com/ Go now, have fun with better games.

												If they fixed the stuttering during main map with nvidia cards (""fix""), this would be hands down the best one in the series. Bought in at high discount and what they did here, the amazing solutions done here (like one big unit pile across castles) easily makes this the best HoMM so far and yes i grew up on HoMM III; this one has all the good that homm3 was, at the same time adding many amazing improvements. Honestly if this one does not stutter for you, and you are a homm fan (a logical one not a pcmustardrace troll) than this IS the best part in the series. Don't let trolls dissuade you, this is an amazing game that is simply not homm3, but homm6, more and better than homm3.			"

												Yes, it's always online (is the AI online?) and you need uplay. Never had an issue with uplay. Just add the game there with the Steam key first (!) and launch it from Steam. Uplay won't even pop up, just sit in the task bar. That integration (at least in Dec 2016) is well made.The game is enjoyable, I am playing my second campaign now and I enjoy it. Kinda sad that ""raising"" a second hero is pointless as you always need to run around with your max army (on one hero) anyway and you lose them at the end of a mission. :(Can't compare it to older Heroes of Might and Magic games as I've only seen them but never played them.

There are never enough troops, I cannot fathom how one can use multiple heroes effectively, giving all of your troops to one hero is often never enough.

The game play is solid, the AI is challenging and you will be kept entertained for the entirety of the game if you can get over the few (but massive) hurdles involved with it.Bugs Murder its' face, even a few years after it's release and they're not getting fixed. Black screens upon entering combat and there are no fixes for this other than to kill the application outright and start again.it also requires the encroaching DRM software known as UPlay like many other Ubisoft games.Uplay made me buy it twice :D Now i have two copies and I can't share one of them with friends!

												Terrible excuse for a ""strategy"" game, they couldn't design competent AI so they just made them blatantly cheat, it's not even hidden like in other strategy games. You either rush all main objectives ASAP (ignoring all creeps/items/side quests) and cheese the AI with elemental summons, or you lose. Also: Maps take hours to complete, there's no such thing as a quick game. The 3D models are pretty ugly, I think Age of Mythology, which was released about a decade before is nicer looking. Loading times are excessive. You are forced to use their crappy proprietary launcher. It's filled with obnoxious nitpicky things like clunky interface, not muting sound when minimized, game tips that don't properly display/disappear, buggy skills or skills that don't work as is obvious, etcI think they definitely paid off all the reviewers, the game is maybe a 3/10 at best.

												Huge fan of the series with part 3 and 4 being my absolute favourites.HoMM 6 implements radical changes (zone control, less resources, teleporting everywhere, town conversion, skill system...) which completely break the game in my opinion.You can now freely pick skills instead of being offered 2-3 choices upon level-up. That leads to the ever same character progression, boring...Add to that the uniform factions which now all play the same and you end up with the worst HoMM game ever.There used to be completely unique factions. Now every faction has healers, archers, grunts etc., the units within a faction a coloured the same. It's just awful all the way.3/10			"

												So let me say up front that I'm only playing this in single player.Issue #1: The game is buggy and the U-Play service has caused a lot of single-player game disconnects for me which wipe recent progress.  It is the service which is having the issue, I check my internet right after issues and its rock solid.  The U-Play service has some interesting ideas on offer, but overall I just don't want the hassle in what I am using as a single player game.Issue #2: The game feels like a slog.  At first I thought I was just bad at the combat, but then I realized that you can trivialize every encounter by just chilling out for weeks at a time recruiting units so you can wipe the other guys out with more numbers.  It just eats up a lot of actual time and it feels like there are a lot of things added so that the game will actually be longer.Issue #3: Again, just doing single player, but the storylines are not engaging.  Most of the time I just want the characters to shut up.			"

												Difficulty exponentially ramps up.  Even the campain is near impossible since the AI amazingly generates 3x the troups you do even when you control 2/3 of the map. A shame too since you spend a lot of time enjoying the game just to get completely wiped in one battle.			"

												So let me say up front that I'm only playing this in single player.Issue #1: The game is buggy and the U-Play service has caused a lot of single-player game disconnects for me which wipe recent progress.  It is the service which is having the issue, I check my internet right after issues and its rock solid.  The U-Play service has some interesting ideas on offer, but overall I just don't want the hassle in what I am using as a single player game.Issue #2: The game feels like a slog.  At first I thought I was just bad at the combat, but then I realized that you can trivialize every encounter by just chilling out for weeks at a time recruiting units so you can wipe the other guys out with more numbers.  It just eats up a lot of actual time and it feels like there are a lot of things added so that the game will actually be longer.Issue #3: Again, just doing single player, but the storylines are not engaging.  Most of the time I just want the characters to shut up.			"

												Dont get me wrong, game itself is lot of fun and great continue in HoMaM series. I still prefer HoMaM 3 over all, but from the modern 4-6, I would pick 6 anytime if there just was not ...... CONNECTING TO CONFLUX ...I bought Shades of Darkness addon, what a waste of money! I cant even unlock this addon because CONFLUX keeps connecting for HOURS! You cant play online, you cant unlock new addons, that a mess! Not even once I succeeded in connecting to CONFLUX even though I opened every possible port and disabled every possible firewall! It totally ruins the whole game, DO YOU LISTEN UBISOFT, you totally ruined this HoMaM for EVERYONE with stupid non-working CONFLUX!! It doesnt work not only for a few individuals, but for thousands of discontent players!Until CONFLUX connection is present and essential for playing this game and unlocking Shades of Darkness, AVOID at all costs, otherwise its absolutely wasted money you pay.

												Do not buy this game especially if you have an NVIDIA graphics card as the card is probably not supported by the game.  I made the mistake of buying this game without doing any research into it since I had played previous games from the series and enjoyed them.  I had great hopes for this game and if I could play it I am sure it is great.  After spending several hours trying to find a work around for the NVIDIA issue I was able to play for about 15 minutes at a time before the game would crash.  Then on the second day of owning the game I was completely unable to launch the game from Ubisoft after unistalling and reinstalling the game several times.  I really would like to play the game but I am just unable to and it is impossible to get a refund for the game.  Do not buy the game.			"

												Fantastic game, too bad it's impossible to play past the tutorial campaign. Not only do the main quest maps not unlock correctly, when you do manage to get a map to unlock, you can't do anything because the video is a wreck--completely dark screens (not black screens, just so dark you can't see anything except a few items that 'glow'). I have loved Might & Magic since its very first release, and I am so, so disappointed in this edition.			"

												Progress: Completed Tutorial Campaign. Made it to second scenario (Towards the Within) of the Necropolis campaign. Did not get stuck and give up, simply lost interest in playing.A decent game marred by some major design issues.  Scenarios are too long and the slightest missteps in the beginning (losing too many units, picking abilities poorly) can set you back hours or take you hours to get to a point when you realize you have to restart.  The greatest downfall for me was the lackluster story.  After 20 hours played my only engagement was a few lines of dialog.  My interest eventually waned.			"

												I would love to give a good review of this game.  I bought it roughly a week or so prior to writing this review.  For the two days I was able to play it, I had a good time with it.  Nothing different than any other turn-based M&M: Heroes game but still fun.   And then I started receiving connection errors.  Error code 1s.  Error code 2s.  Unable to connect to Conflux.  Unable to connect to Uplay.  Etc.  Etc.  I spent about a day troubleshooting these issues.  (More or less half a day, really.)  Nothing I tried worked.  Uninstalling/reinstalling.  Opening ports that I had already made sure were open.  Disabling/tweaking virus protections, etc.  Deleting HOSTS files, etc.  Nothing worked.  Nothing anyone in any forum I could find suggested worked.So, once I exhausted every avenue I could possibly think of, I turned to Ubisoft's tech support.  After waiting 4 days for a response, they got back to me with your typical automated response.  ""Open ports, reinstall, etc...""  You know, the usual horrendous level one IT garbage.After waiting 4 more days for a response when I told them I had already tried everything they recommended plus many other things that they clearly had no idea about -> I finally just gave up and threw in the towel.  Since you are unable to get a refund on a game you purchase through Steam, I basically paid whatever amount of dollars (20 or so I think) for nothing.  Which leads me to my final conclusion:  Don't buy this game.  Don't buy ANY Ubisoft game, in fact.  While I want to love their games, I abhor their DRM software which causes these problems.  It was clearly written by monkeys.  What is happening should be illegal.  Anyway, I hope you have better luck with this game than I did.   If you choose not to listen to this review, that is your freedom and right.  But when the same thing happens to you, there can be no excuse.  You've been warned.

												DO NOT BUY THIS! Avoid it like the plague until they remove the UPLAY account requirements. I just went to boot this thing up and got the lovely message that I needed a UPLAY account. This reminded me immediately of the debacle with Mass Effect 3 and ORIGIN. I bit, tried to register an account only for it to tell me that the service has suffered an unrecoverable error. Tried to register again 3 more times, same crap. So basically I've paid for something I can't use. Well played Ubisoft you've successfully stolen my money.

												I almost never write reviews, but I decided to for this game. Upon reading all the negative reviews, I almost didnt buy the game being scared of UPlay DRM issues and such. Finally for $5 on sale, I decided to try my luck with it anyway. Wary of issues, I logged into my Uplay account and added the steam game code before launching it. Game launched no problem, with no uplay pop-ups or anything, Been playing for a few days now, no UPlay DRM interruption, so maybe people are exaggerating, or maybe they fixed it.On to the actual game:Graphics : on par with M&M5, could be crisper but still pretty good. Setting looks very familiar if you've played previous versions. The actual combat has decent details and spell effects, as for the exploring part, it could be better but is in line with M&M5 Gameplay : Plenty of campaign, decently challenging, nice voice-overs done for main quest lines, and the quests dialogue didnt come across as super cheezy text filler.Heroes have more customizations, legendary weapons that level as you gain experience, and the skill tree has been re-worked to let you create more hybrid builds (knight that can cast aoe mage spells if youd like). There also seems to be a lot more variety on hero gear (most of it set items) so you can really customize your hero.Combat:  You have to move and clear enemies quickly or armies becomes too strong and will cost you valuable units that will be felt on the final battles. This sometimes feels a bit unbalanced but its the same old way as previous versions.Final thoughts : Uplay never got in my way with DRM (not yet at least), graphics are nice (don't look reallly outdated), gameplay has improved a bit from previous versions, plenty of missions and challenges to complete, if you get this game on sale for under 10$, and you're a fan of the M&M series, you'll enjoy your purchase.

												I really enjoy the earlier Heroes games, but Ubisoft's stupid UPlay requirement has made it hard for me to get involved with this version. The game has gotten more complicated and not more fun. Ubisoft is trying to replace my Steam overlay with their UPlay service and it annoys me. You also get an advertisement for other Ubisoft games every time you finish a session.  If their servers are down or having trouble handling the traffic, you can't play your game. Heroes III is one of my favorite games of all time and Ubisoft has sucked the soul out of the series. I don't know why they can't wrap their brain around the idea that strong arming your customers stunts your sales.			"

												I really enjoy the earlier Heroes games, but Ubisoft's stupid UPlay requirement has made it hard for me to get involved with this version. The game has gotten more complicated and not more fun. Ubisoft is trying to replace my Steam overlay with their UPlay service and it annoys me. You also get an advertisement for other Ubisoft games every time you finish a session.  If their servers are down or having trouble handling the traffic, you can't play your game. Heroes III is one of my favorite games of all time and Ubisoft has sucked the soul out of the series. I don't know why they can't wrap their brain around the idea that strong arming your customers stunts your sales.			"

												This game (and the ""Complete Edition"" Steam pack) will not run on laptops with equivalent capabilities to the listed system requirements. If you buy this game for a laptop you will soon discover that the original creators are out of business, the publishers refuse to support the game for laptops, and that there are scores of angry players both in the Ubisoft and Steam forums unable to run the game at all, with no possibility of a refund from either Steam (user agreement stipulates no refunds) or from the publishers. Attempting to run the game from a laptop fails before any menu is reached, and there are no community patches either to remedy this. BE WARNED!			"

												NVida card owners note that this game may not work for you. From what I can read on the forums, there are common glitches that occure for NVidia card owners that may tie up the game so that you cannot play. I love the Heroes games, what part of this game I could play I also loved, however at one point I couldn not progress anymore into the game because it kept crashing. Ubisoft has no support for these crashes. I and many others have placed support tickets with Ubisoft and for myself I got a very generic answer and they closed the ticket without informing me. I'm sorry but until they fix this, don't waste your money and time on this one.			"

												A big step down from HoMM5 - Tribes of the east. Content is either dulled down or absent entirely, and not just small things, but entire factions. There is also no alternative creature upgrade tree, meaning each factions has one less of each troop type than TotE. Action camera seems to be absent entirely from combat, which is slower than the previous game. Heroes no longer have their own turn in combat, but can instead cast a spell when on a creatures turn. UI is smaller but more cluttered, making for a worse experience. There is no map generator for custom games, which is terrible. I cannot recommend this over the previous entry other than for online features, or a prettier but clumsier presentation. Uplay is also required, be that a possitive or negative for you. Go buy tribes of the east instead.			"

												Seriously should have looked into this game harder but steam summer sale was to good to pass up. NO LAN MULTIPLAYER and the online servers suck for anyone who is playing more than one computer on the same network. I bought a copy for me and my other half and we can not play multiplayer at all. It will freeze after a while for one of us and then we have to ctrl-alt-del to get out of the frozen game. They still have hotseat, but that is tiring on the nerves not to mention a pain. No thanks. Single player is typical Heroes M&M so that part is ok but not what i wanted to do.			"

												If you are a fan of Heroes III or Heroes V, DO NOT BUY. Pros: Very nice graphics, good spread of decent units. A few nice concepts, but not well executed. Story isn't bad, though let down by horrid voice acting. Seriously, King's Bounty had better voice acting. Destiny stuff is a neat idea, though all of the extra heroes were free for me, maybe from DLC? The music is mostly ripped off from HOMM5 and reochestrated, so it's alright. I do like the idea that your hero can go on any allied turn instead of having to wait for a specific place in the initiative. Also, when you recruit from a town, It automatically recruits from surrounding structures and other forts etc. No wait time, the troops are just there (by magic I assume). Saves time on re-arming, even if it makes no damn sense.Cons: HOLY CRAP IS THE VOICE ACTING BAD. Necromancy is nerfed to uselessness, The other racial abilities are frankly meh, All heroes have all of the same abilities to pick from, and spells are just abilities. You get to pick one per level essentially, and a lot of the core spells aren't there (No summoning to speak of, no raise dead, almost no direct damage spells.) Nice 3D rendered towns like HOMM5 you can circle around in? Nope! Static images with overlays. Also, the interface overlay crawls, even if the rest of the game runs great (AMD quad core, Geforce 560)The real shame is the sheer homoginization of the play styles accross races. Since all heroes have the same ability access and trees, you just pick the tactic you like and then hang some set dressing on it by picking a race. Literally no other flavor involved. The units are a nice mix, but they all are roughly the same at each tier. Also the AI is balls. Aims for highest tier, or ranged and ignores everything else. Sieges are about as challenging as water baloon fights. Also adds in the idea of territory control, which is kind of nice and kind of dumb. To control a mine or sawmill etc, you have to control the fort or town it is in the territory of. You don't get any resources from it unless your hero is parked on it otherwise it continues pumping to the local town as normal. This would be neat if you could at least stop production from it by attacking it and sacking it, thus denying resources, but no, the moment you leave it it just reverts back. So again, cool idea, with a flaw in execution.Overall, if I had played a demo of this game, I would not have bought it. I payed $10 on the autumn sale and uninstalled it within 24 hours, and wish I had my $10 back.			"

												It's the average, less exiting M&M experience. The combat is about the only thing that keeps this game together, as the rest is really sort of meh. Options are limited / dumbed down, there's only 1 way to go for most heroes for optimum effect and the AI cheats their asses off to a point where it's just frustrating, rather than a challenge.And let's not talk about the multiplayer, or the lack of a proper working one and there's no LAN option at all. It's absolutely horrid and Ubisoft refuses to fix the problem, or even reply to the made complaints. In my case (and many others) I get 'out of sync' after 50 or so turns. I reload the game from 7-10 turns ago, still 'out of sync'. This happens with every multiplayer game.It's rather hard to recommend the game because of these flaws, but, the combat is really well executed.It may be better to get this when it's 80% off or something, it's deffinatly not worth the full price. That said, I forgot to leave out that it has the Uplay requirement and after that, you're required to be always online (yes, it will kick you out of a single player game if you disconnect).			"

												The Might & Magic franchise has been known as one of the greatest producers in these kind of turn based strategy games, and I believe that Might & Magic: Heroes VI, has yet another great addition to its forefathers. I really like strategy games, especially strategy games that take a long time to actually complete. With many customization options, you can really craft the game you are really wanting. Anyway, on to pros and cons...Pros-Graphics, simply put, amazing. The graphics for the characters and enviroments are completely what I was expecting from this game at this time. The characters themselves look really good, although they have limited animations, so the characters tend to get a little boring, but that isn't really a big problem.Controls, the controls are very efficient and very user friendly. You can complete your turn with only a few clicks if you use the menues correctly.Interface, the interface for the overworld if very nice, you get all of the important information right in front of you with the ability to make changes on the spot.Combat, personally my favorite part! The combat is similar to the games previous to this one, but in this one the combat is more user friendly, but also doesn't reduce the amount of strategicness (strategicness isn't a word, but you get it). Combat is played like a turn based RPG, just picture a literal boardgame and that is exactly what it feels like. Your hero doesn't actually take part in the combat on the board, but does attacks and skills from the sideline. This is not a common thing in games like this, but this game has done a great job at doing it this way.Local Multiplayer/Hotseat, I am giving this its own section, because it is just plain amazing! Although having a large group of people playing on one computer may seem at first inefficient and slow, playing with friends is great fun. Being a Dungeon Master (Game Master of Dungeons&Dragons) has taught me that bringing people together to interact with something is a great way to have fun with your friends. Anyway, moving on now...Cons-Repetitive, the game can seem repetitive after playing it a while. The combat is basically the same thing every time, so I can see where people can get tired of this game quickly (personally, I am fine with the repetitive nature of it).Campaign, although the campaign was overall nice and what was to be expected from Might & Magic, it just didn't get me into the story. The story itself didn't really seem relavent to the game itself, the game could have been completely fine without even having the campaign. The voice acting just didn't seem realistic/believable enough was another issue with the campaign.Other than those minor flaws, this is overall an amazing game that I definitely recommend.Conclusion-I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a gameplay experience similar to any number of classic tabletop roleplaying games. It is a fun game and it is especially fun if you have others to play it with. Strategy games are perhaps my favorite kind of games, and this one is high on my list of recommended ones for sure.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League			"

												I'm going to start by saying I really wanted to like this game. It actually has the makings of a good game in there but for one major flaw. I can live with uplay and I've only once had any trouble logging in. My problem is with how the game handles the difficulty.It has been mentioned before but your resupplies are granted weekly. The enemy's troops are also topped up weekly. The problem is that as you're exploring the map getting into fights and loosing troops the enemy isn't. On my first play through I wanted to get around the map, get into battles and collect prizes (usually armor). By the time I got to the boss his army was so big they were undefeatable. I started again, this time racing through as fast as I could. This time I pushed on to quickly and was caught out by a roaming enemy.Both times I played on normal because I don't do easy. I'm sure with another couple of attempts I could get it right but there's the problem. There's a difference a game being hard and a game being cheap. If the game took your play style and army size into account it could have worked. Instead the developers figured it would be best to have the enemy army grow at a consistent rate regardless of what you do or how you play. The game is too much about time management and too little about fun and so I can't recommend it.If, like me, you like the look and idea of this game keep looking as there are countless other games that do a much better job of being a good fun game.

Of course you might not encounter these issues but be careful, it's a horrible product when it's functionality depends on luck.			"

												To everyone thinking about purchasing this game: Don't. This game is literally unplayable. After you have installed it and get to the main menu, you are unable to play anything because the game doesn't register the key correctly. It keeps saying that the serialkey you have used is already in use. I tried to solve this mess by contacting ubisoft via ticket and it was resolved without solving or giving me anything else but ""we are looking into this problem"". And this was a year ago when I first pre-ordered the game, and when I tried to install it again today, same problem.I repeat: DON'T BUY THIS GAME.			"

												Do not listen to the naysayers. This game is excellent. Is it as good as Heroes of Might and Magic III? No. Is it as good as Herose of Might and Magic V? I'd say they are about equal. Since their newest update, I have experienced no bugs, no crashes, no problems. The story is droll, but it was droll in V as well. The voice acting is a bit better than it had been in V, but not by much. The gameplay is excellent, the variety in units and races is pleasing, and the graphics are pretty damn beautiful. I wouldn't pay 60 dollars for it (which I did not) but I sure as hell would fork out 10 for the entire collection! What a steal!			"

												The people who are putting this game down are complaining about Uplay, not about the game. The game is good. Uplay is redundant, unnecessary and cumbersome. However, it does not detract from the game itself. Someone said there are multiple steps to registering with Uplay. There is one (admittedly redundant) step, and it consists of pasting your CD key from Steam into Uplay. Someone said Uplay has too much downtime. I've played every Assassin's Creed game through Uplay as well as Rayman Legends, so I have a lot of time spent on Uplay. I have yet to have one incident in which I could not play because Uplay was down.Would I rather not have Uplay? Damn right. Redundant ""services"" like Uplay and Origin should just move everything over to Steam. They are trying to fight piracy by punishing their paying customers. It's the most ridiculous and ill-conceived plan imaginable. However, people should not be putting this excellent game down because of Ubisoft's paranoid, control freak mentality. If you like HOMM games, you'll love this edition.			"

												This game is great for a new player to the franchise. Fans of past games see it as one of the worst, but the way the game teaches you how to play is very easy to understand, and since it has the least amount of resource types, its easier to manage buildings and units. I like the fact that there are bosses, reputation classes, dynasty heroes, a bestiary and the campaign that is actually really good. If you have never played a Might and Magic Heroes game before, this will probably be a great strategy game for any library. The biggest downfall is Uplay, which is the unneccisary second step to logging into the game which must be updated to the most recent version to even access. If you have troubles starting the game, uninstall Uplay and then reinstall it a couple times, thats how i got mine to work after.			"

The improved gameplay and interface over V, the more cohesive castles, and series-unique take on magic make it very engaging. The campaign is much better than IV or V as well. But like everyone else has mentioned, this game is absolutely crippled by always-online DRM, having to log into/install UPlay, and weird overpowered unlocks tied to an achievement point system/cash shop. You will get booted from your game arbitrarily. It will happen, and more than once. Until this game is disconnected from all the Ubisoft garbage, I can't recommend this game at all.			"

Its easier to play this game if you pirate it than on steam! Double sync with cloud on both uplay and steam (WTF) autosync on Uplay always fails!! And thats just starting the game! Game is dumbed down with only 3 resources and mine controls are noob friendly if you control castle you control all mines, i dont mind this because im lazy i find this as a good thing, what is bad is the lazy programing concerning game AI! I mean lazy developers wanted to gimp players who just play passive and stockpile army so they can go on later and steamroll the scenario/campaing, i dont really mind gimping this but the way they did it is completley wrong! Ai ignores economy it just spawns armies out of the blue and gets fresh troops through some sort of Harry Potter sorcery, so if you want to win only way is rush and realoding battles since you cant afford to loose a single creature, so all of you who like to explore the map you gonna have a bad time....I only marked review positive because of the price i feel seriosly sorry for folks who paid full price on this!

												I love the Heroes of Might and Magic Series though I never got into playing #4.  The 3rd release has always been and seems it will always be the best even if lacking in graphics!  The 6th release is very playable, but it lacks the depth of even the flop release of #4.  Being restricted to playing online for your complete features is just stupid and should be choice rather than mandated to receive your features.At this point I will edit my review...  The game itself is fun if it does get a bit monotonous at times, but then you will find getting to play the game your biggest challenge as UPLAY constantly drops connection sending you back to the main menu or just will not access the internet.  After much digging, it is not Heroes 6, but an inconsistent UPLAY Server; it seems that Ubisoft cannot seem to keep the main server running consistently...I can understand their concerns over antipiracy and cheating, but I have a feeling UBISOFT loses more money using UPLAY than people could ever steal from them...  Until UPLAY starts working consistently or it is cut out of the loop I no longer recommend this game or any game from UBISOFT!If you buy the Heroes 3 HD, buy at your own risk in January...  By the way, the disks still work perfectly...If you buy the Heroes 7 coming out next year, buy at your own risk...  If you need example, catch Heroes 6 on a friends computer and try playing after midnight...  UPLAY rarely stays logged in after midnight and stays offline until 6 am...			"

The publisher, and the two studios that have worked with the game, have made progress... but it is still ongoing. The core gameplay is to my liking, however.

												The absolute best the series has to offer, Might & Magic Heroes VI is an instant classic for me.  If you've never played the Heroes games, essentially it's a vivid medieval fantasy world where noble humans, towering demons, ghastly undead and an array of other factions all clash together to fight their way to victory on a living, breathing chess board. Unlike chess, though, the combat is a rush, with each unit having its own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses. This installment also features the most extensive multiplayer suite yet, with some very exciting features like character persistence, customisation and some very dynamic maps to play on. Definitely recommended, even from someone who rarely appreciates turn-based strategy.			"

												I would not recommend this game.  This game witholds powerful items from you if you can't connect to the musertious 'Conflux' servers. and Guess what? You can NEVER connect to the conflux servers.  So, in addition to basically denying you powerful items, the game is immensely imbalanced.  The developers couldn't take the time to balance the game properly so you know what they did? They gave the computer terrible, unfair advantages.  The computer can generate huge armies in little or no time with little or no resources, while the player is discouraged from exploring the map by the ridiculous rate at which the computer gains armies.  This makes the campaign feel completely unplayable and unfair.  Combine this with U(don't)Play forced into your mouth everytime you turn it on, and a 50% chance that UPlay will crash your game, and this will make a throughly BAD GAME.  DO NOT BUY.			"

												As a Heroes of Might and magic long time fan it is with great disapointment that I must say I cannot recommend this game.Heroes VI had everything to be a solid game, but it's intrinsic connection to UPLAY DRM and the plethora of gameplay bugs makes this one of the weakest entries of the series.The gameplay is still solid thanks to the stellar formula of the game, however, the game in itself has many bugs that have not been solved in 2016, and the UPLAY Conflux mechanic simply disconnects you without even saving your game whenever your connection fluctuates with their servers. This leads to much frustration.The music of the game is overrall uninspired, even after the expansion (that made remixes of classic tracks). The voice acting is downright terrible. The graphics and concepts are good and the late inclusion of town screens was a great addition to the game.This game is flawed in the little things, but its flaws are not at all small - they are very noticeable and contributes to a negative experience.If you are a Heroes fan and can get this game on a sale, by all means do it. However, buyers should be wary of acquiring this game at full price. Overral, I would give it a 6/10.			"

												To say good game ruined by Uplay. First i had problems with log - always error -> solution go to steam folder change Gu & Might & Magic Heroes VI to run as admin, so it started, first mish done, start 2nd and screen says you cant use this features in offline mode (WTF im online all the time).  Alltogether good game, graphics and f***** protection.Now conclusion if you like HOMM its worth to have it, if its on discount, if its your first game - dont.Update: so game have save option and autosave - game cant load saved files. DONT BUY.........			"

												As a Heroes of Might and magic long time fan it is with great disapointment that I must say I cannot recommend this game.Heroes VI had everything to be a solid game, but it's intrinsic connection to UPLAY DRM and the plethora of gameplay bugs makes this one of the weakest entries of the series.The gameplay is still solid thanks to the stellar formula of the game, however, the game in itself has many bugs that have not been solved in 2016, and the UPLAY Conflux mechanic simply disconnects you without even saving your game whenever your connection fluctuates with their servers. This leads to much frustration.The music of the game is overrall uninspired, even after the expansion (that made remixes of classic tracks). The voice acting is downright terrible. The graphics and concepts are good and the late inclusion of town screens was a great addition to the game.This game is flawed in the little things, but its flaws are not at all small - they are very noticeable and contributes to a negative experience.If you are a Heroes fan and can get this game on a sale, by all means do it. However, buyers should be wary of acquiring this game at full price. Overral, I would give it a 6/10.			"

												I've played through every single Heroes of Might and Magic game as they were released, and this is definitely my favorite one post-HOMM III. The improved gameplay and interface over V, the more cohesive castles, and series-unique take on magic make it very engaging. The campaign is much better than IV or V as well. But like everyone else has mentioned, this game is absolutely crippled by always-online DRM, having to log into/install UPlay, and weird overpowered unlocks tied to an achievement point system/cash shop. You will get booted from your game arbitrarily. It will happen, and more than once. Until this game is disconnected from all the Ubisoft garbage, I can't recommend this game at all.			"

												I have given this game so many chances. I have tried to like it and failed. Even on a brand new computer, this game looks terrible and has major performance issues. I recommend the first four games in the Heroes of Might and Magic series (before Ubisoft took over), but not the fifth or sixth. It pales in comparison to the earlier entries, and is still awful when judged on its own merits. I understand that it was developed by an inexperienced team, and I am sure they will become more skilled later in their careers. They are currently developing Heroes 7. So far, it looks like it will be more of the same, but let's just hope this team can learn from their mistakes. In the mean time, I recommend that you play Heroes of Might and Magic 2, 3, and 4 instead.			"

												Horrible horrible game.  It could have been good, but the overall user experience is terrible.  First of all, Ubisoft makes it a hassle to even play the game by requiring both password and mobile phone authentication.  This alone nearly caused me to uninstall the game.The campaigns and difficulty levels are really bad.  There is no difference between Normal and Easy mode.  Played Normal first, but found it way too unforgiving.  But even in easy mode, you can expect to have to play campaign maps over and over because the game makes it so that errors early on are uncorrectable.  Played a campaign where my army took heavy losses early on.  When this happens, you might as well start the campaign over instead of continuing to play as there is little you can do to gather enough troops to actually win the end fight.After several replayed and failed campaigns, I decided to go see if there are cheat codes available.  Sometimes a poorly designed game can be improved with cheat codes.  To my dismay, there are no cheat codes available for this game.  You can download a trainer (which I prefer to avoid), but come on...all the best games have chear codes.  Overall, this is a really bad game.  Not at all like earlier Heroes of M&M.  I'd much rather play Age of Wonders.  They know how to make a great game.			"

												Bought the complete edition on sale @$9.99 USD. Few installation problems with Uplay and Steam but I found a way around it.PROS Very long and illustrious franchisewith its ups and downs. Up to HOMM6 now.Certain classes of heroes (Sanctuary) can swim without a ship if all units in the army are amphibious. Similar to Disciples but a good addition. Would also have liked a hero that can fly. Makes each faction less generic.Pirate race of neutrals sounded great (Crag Hack campaign) until it became all Orc Class / Stronghold Faction. Good attempt.CONSThe game feels like it is incomplete. After playing Might and Magic : Duel of Champions and seeing all the different creatures, spells, classes, buildings and heroes, Heroes feels like it is still in alpha.Diplomacy mechanic has not been changed. It is is still very weak and almost useless. It only increases the number of creatures that join you and only affects neutral creatures. Creature stances are fixed in stone and do not change e.g. Hostile creatures stay hostile all the way throughout the game.Minor issues like illogical campaign speeches e.g. Orc Campaign : Acama speaks on your side when you have yet to convince him to join you.Campaign choices for Tears vs Blood may always favour Tears since letting neutral creatures run away without a fight gains +10 Tears.Dynasty weapons take way too long to grind up beyond Level 2.Logging into CONFLUX before the game starts is getting on my nerves.Edit:Story is pretty boring for all factions, except the Necropolis. Only Anastasya's story is somewhat interesting.Faction abilities are not of an equal level. 1. Having the Necropolis have the most powerful faction ability to resurrect AND heal is quite overpowered. Not to mention. Having the Altar of Eternal Servitude makes it even worse with an immortal army.2. Gating ability for Inferno takes too long to activate. It has to first gain points then wait in queue to be summoned. Although being able to summon anywhere on the map seems enviable, it is quite easy countered. Gating units does not help to prevent unit loss since gated units do not stay. While the L4 gated ability (instant gate + copy of original stack) is ridiculously powerful, it takes way too long to activate.3. The Haven ""bubble"" is not very useful. Enemies almost always have another valid target to attack. The main benefit is being fast to cast and preventing your range units from being targetted in the first round of combat.4. Castle architecture is very bland. They resemble coloured boxes. You can't differentiate a barracks from a market.RECOMMENDATIONBring in all the stuff from MMDOC into Heroes. E.g. Wizard Class/Academy Faction which already existed in previous versions of Heroes, Tier 4 creatures like the Ghost Dragon, Wyvern Riders for the Stronghold.You can even bring in unique creatures to prevent classes from turning stale.g. Al Betyl Ghoul is a way more powerful ghoul compared to normal Ravenous Ghouls for the Necropolis.For Diplomacy, allow it to change the stance of the creatures towards you. e.g. Diplomacy makes Hostile to Aggressive and Agressive to Passive and Passive to Friendly. The ability to bribe safe passage. The ability for Diplomacy to work on enemy heroes not just neutrals.Flying heroes. On dragons.Co-op campaign maps.REFERENCEShttp://www.mmdoc.net/card_list/thumbs/type_card/creature/ "

												I skip the whole Uplay drama. Everything has already been said about that. Yeah, I ignored it, too. As a reward I got to play a game with the popular tags for RPG, strategy, and base-building. What can possibly go wrong with this?Basebuilding is actually its most surprising failure. On the PC, basebuilding is my cup of tea. I still don't understand how it is possible to make basebuilding in a game this uninteresting. Maybe it is, because one cannot build bases. But hey, I am able to push a button in an existing base so now I have a marketplace *tremble exitedly and uncontrollably* Bliss! Buy the game and you, too, will be able to push that button.It would be mean to give the game bad grades for strategy. It just does wrong what most real-time strategy games do wrong: It celebrates the tank rush - oh wait, it's not real-time... whatever - and since the AI is dumber than a rubber plug on a toilet brush, the enemies grow exponentially faster than you. On purpose. Running against that point of no return is an actual game objective. Joy! And you can explore... well, you can clean the map, if you find the time and the fancy to be wittled down by inconsequential tank rushes, while your real target stacks troops. I love it, when a few weeks into the game you buy a hero, who comes with some 17 troops, while the big baddie buys a hero with 4 ""hordes"", upwards of 200 troops. But hey I am the one who is too dumb to find that amusing, right? I see a lot of thumbs up who actually enjoy this farce.Ah, an RPG. Don't you love a strategy game with RPG elements? Yeah, me too. And HoMM6 comes with a whole bevy of choices. Exciting! Well, it would be even more exciting, if I could afford to choose, rather than being manhandled into picking one of the three abilities that push the point out at which enemies can no longer be beaten. Do you believe that there are abilities, whose biggest benefit is to delay the end of a battle, so you can regenerate your fallen? Maybe that's the roleplaying part. When watching a battle unfold, your objective is not to win, It is to win without losses. And you roleplay that this makes your skirt fly. *whispers* While you are doing this, don't waste your time waving your personal wand +6 vs. shoddy software at the game. I tried that. It's immune.On the C64 there was a game thirty years ago called Bouncing Kamoungas. HoMM6's entertainment value is only marginally below the one of this classic. If you think that having a deadline beyond which everything on the map hacks you into pieces makes a cool basebuilder, RPG, and strategy game, then HoMM6 is your Game of the Year. I, on the other hand, am off on a quest to find my C64 instead... hmm, if I was a thirty year old bread box, where would I be?			"

												Rarely do I write reviews. I feel that I should in this case so maybe someone will benefit from my experience. I simply cannot play this game properly because UPlay will not either connect or stay connected. The forced, constant internet connection in order to play the game as it's meant to be played has been nothing but a perisistent annoyance and deterence. I have been consistently either disconnected during play, finished playing and been told ""cannot sync savegame with online server"" or played offline and realized game features do not work in offline mode. Worst part is that I paid for it. It's so easy to pirate games and avoid dealing with this, but I try to suuport the devs and then I regret doing so.

												It's kind of hard to rate this game.  It is a part of the M&M Heroes series, which alone makes it worth playing.  However, there are some things about this game that I just really don't like very much.  Probably the biggest complaint I have is the rushed feeling that this game has about it.  Unlike the other games in the series where you were given more time in each level for exploring, this game comes at you fast and furious.  It seems like every level you are simply trying to just stay alive long enough to finally build up an army which you can use to rush toward the enemy.  There are quite a few areas that you want to explore, but every time you start going toward them, suddenly another large enemy army is marching towards your city(ies), and you have to turn around and defend yourself (there's no way that you can produce a generic hero strong enough to defend yourself, only your main hero has a chance to win.)  Even on the easiest level this game just doesn't want to give you the chance to explore and discover all parts of the map.  Plus, the longer you take to explore, and look around the enemy quickly becomes so strong that you can't possibly win.There have been quite a few changes to the actual gameplay and interface as well (some good, some not so good), which is probably more of an individual preference as to whether one likes them or not.The story doesn't seem to be nearly as strong as was that of HoMM V, plus you have the option of choosing which campaign you want to play, rather than having to unlock the campaigns as you go along (which also kind of takes away from the continuity of the story).Another huge problem with this game is having to use UPlay to actually play the game.  UPlay and Steam just don't want to work well together, and normally I have to try to launch the game 2 or 3 times (sometimes even more), just to get it to actually work.  Once I turned Uplay's sinchronizing feature off, it did help a little, but only a little.If you are a big fan of the series, then you will want to play this game (even with all of it's irritations and quirks), but just don't expect the same epic experience that you got from HoMM V - it just doesn't compare.

It is still clearly a heroes-game as far as I can tell. The new features like reputation, which make the game more replayable and interesting and the new skill system, which I admire with every playthrough, I must say the devs realized a game which uses old concepts with new features seamlessly.

												While not needing nearly as much strategizing as the third or fifth installments in the series, it is still better than the fourth by a landslide. It is hard to say if it is better, because too much is different, though the pacing certainly feels much faster. There are 6 full length campaigns in the game, and each campaign takes at least 12 hours of nonstop gameplay to beat on normal - longer on hard. Glitches and bugs are thankfully for the most part nonexistent.You'll definitely get your money's worth on this, though waiting for a sale or price drop might be your thing if you don't like how 'casual' the game seems to have become.

I dont actually having problem with Uplay, by going online you get to play with some extra goodies which are quite nice like the dynasty weapons and dynasty traits etc. But I think that to be able to play offline is important as well especially for some players that have no constant internet. Uplay is still not good enough for seemless play between online and offline. Overall, it's a very good game. Im looking forward to play H5 ToE as well after finishing H6. As for H7, its much criticised bugs refrain me from buying it. FYI, H6 is not as buggy as I read from the user reviews and so I give a recommendation to H6 with reservations.			"

TL;DR - The best Heroes installment since the third one. Amazing graphics, suprisingly good story and a great price to gameplay value, but it comes with the horrible Ubisoft DRM system (UPLAY) that forces you to be always online. Campaign offers about 120h of gametime with core game and additional 60-70h with all available DLC (Pirates, Dance Macabre, Shades of Darkness).PRO's+ Overall gameplay improvement - Although I played Heroes V for some time and recall some improvements implemented before, the overall gameplay overhaul in Heroes VI is, for me, its greatest advantage. All the flaws of the Heroes III (which I am very fond of) are fixed and remade into intersting mechanics. I could name many examples, but I will focus on the two selected, the first being the Town Portal mechanics. In H3 all you ever wanted from your Hero was to have Earth Magic on Advanced level and a single Town with Town Portal spell to learn. If you could get it, you practically won the game, as you could jump around the world to collect your units and utilize a devastating mobility advantage. In H6 all units from given faction can be purchased in a single Town, provided it has all the necessary dwellings so there is no need to jump from town to town to accumulate the army. As for the mobility advantage, Town Portal is no longer a spell you have to learn - its a building you can create in any of your castles. Level 1 Town Portal allows a visiting hero to teleport to any other town or fort of his choosing and Level 2 Town Portal allows any here to teleport back to the city (nearest with L2 Town Portal) from any place on the map. As you can use only one of those spells on a single turn, Town Portal becomes a commodity and a feature of its own. The second noteworthy feature is the complete revamp of unit tiers. In the past units were categorized by 7 tiers, first one being the cheap weaklings and the last one being an all-powerful destroyer. Now you got pretty similar units but reworked into 3 tiers: Core (three first units), Elite (the next three) and Champion (the old Tier 7). All Core units are comparable in their usefulness and so are the Elites, but they got their traits that would work best for certain heroes (as the rule of a thumb, there is a Might unit, a Magic unit and a shooter in both Core and Elite tier). This makes creating your army more flexible and greatly increase the basic unit performance in comparison with Champions. Unit reclassification was the real gamechanger and a very welcome one.+ Astonishing graphics - The environment is pretty amazing, especially in the campaign maps. The world is filled with random magical objects or unique decorations that really help to maintain the magical character of the world of Ashan. It is also very well optimizes for older graphic cards. Unit design is top notch and campaign posters (images seen when loading a campaign map) are simply fantastics.+ Interesting storyline - The world of Heroes has always been ridiculous and over-the-top with its magical theme, but I think this is the first time the main story actually embraced it and used it so effectively. The dialogues form a suprisingly coherent narrative for the main plot, which might not be written that greatly, but sure as hell is well voice-acted. I was very positively suprised how well contrived the world of Ashan is in the dialogues, so the story has its value whatsoever.+ Lots of playtime - The game, even without DLC, provides you with a very decent amount of content to go through. Core game has 22 campaign missions, clocking at about 5h each, so you can easily go over 100h just enjoying the single player mode. DLC add another 14 missions (2 in Pirates, 2 in Dance Macabre and 8 in Shades of Darkness, so the two adventure packs ain't worth the price), with similar amount of gameplay within. And of course the multiplayer, especially the couch one, can provide you with another Infinity hours of gameplay. If you buy the Gold or Complete edition on sale, the price to value ratio is pretty damn good.+ Very heroes-y music - Lots of the tunes are remakes of the H3 score and everything else really complements the graphic design. Soundtrack is what you would expect from a Heroes game, but thats a good thing!CON's- UPLAY - Ubisoft bloody DRM will turn the game off when the Internet is down (less often) or UPLAY servers are unresponsive (very often). It also forces itself into the game in the form of CONFLUX orbs - something similar to chatrooms, placed near boss battle locations. Their Mission/Reward system is stupid and the whole software is simply annoying as all hell. Still, its not Origin, so I guess it could have been worse.- No hexgrid (again) - Why did the developers of Heroes decided to go from classy hexgrid battle to obviously inferior square tiles? I know it was the same with H5, but why? Hexgrid is million times better!- Some balancing issues - Although units on their own are very well balanced when comparing factions, the Hero bonuses are not. Faction powers of Haven and Necropolis are far better then those of Sanctuary or Stronghold. Blood/Tear bonuses also vary from totally worthless to grossly overpowered.- Gets kinda repetitive - After few missions and some skill experimenting, the game gets pretty easy and repetitive. Reinforcement skill almost break the game, as it allows you to go through most minor battles without a single lost unit. You don't have to change your tactic that much to win with different enemies.Overall, I recommend this game very stronly. Unless you hate UPLAY more then I did or you want to play this game competitively againts your friends, you gonna love H6 if there is any affection for turn-based strategies in your heart. Is it better then H5? HELL YES! Is it better then H3? Arguably yes, but even those that treasure H3 as the best game ever will say that H6 holds the solid second place on the HoM&M podium.			"

												This game is great when you are able to play it, but with U play constantly disconnecting and losing your save data, it's more frustration than anything.  I didn't pay to be frustrated.  There is no reason why this game requires an always online for a single player game.  Sometimes, you can't even log into Upay, When this happens, you cannot play the game.  UBsoft will blame the problem on your poor internet connection, but I have no problem with Steam or watching Youtube while I wait to play this game.  I bought this game awhile ago, stop playing due to frustration.  Came back years later, and problem has not gotten any better.  Really not worth it.  I really did try to make this game work.  it is such a shame that this game cannot be played appropriately.  It says I have 1.8 hrs, but really 70-80% of it was trying to get the damn thing to run.  I do not recommend this game becouse you will just be frustrated.			"

												I like the well-planned campaigns and storyline. Graphics is colourful and eye-pleasing. Gameplay is excellent, it's very much a HOMM. I dont actually having problem with Uplay, by going online you get to play with some extra goodies which are quite nice like the dynasty weapons and dynasty traits etc. But I think that to be able to play offline is important as well especially for some players that have no constant internet. Uplay is still not good enough for seemless play between online and offline. Overall, it's a very good game. Im looking forward to play H5 ToE as well after finishing H6. As for H7, its much criticised bugs refrain me from buying it. FYI, H6 is not as buggy as I read from the user reviews and so I give a recommendation to H6 with reservations.			"

												I've owned this game for several years, I install and uninstall when I'm done playing. I see a lot of snipey reviews about Uplay not working, or this game glitching out. That's unfortunate, I haven't had a single problem for 5 years, over 3 desktops. I've run this game on Windows 8, 8.1 and now run it on Windows 10.I own an i7-based system from 2010, maybe this is magic hardware? I've seen 4 graphics cards play this game, all nVidia (current a 9xx series GTX.)I think if you are unable to play this game you should be provided with a refund and your CD/Activation key(s) revoked accordingly. It's silly that there would be this many negative reviews for a game that was fun to play, is still fun to play, and which I've never had any problem playing.. I don't know about steam, but I know Origin will refund games that don't work.Is it so hard for Steam/Ubisoft to do the same? "

												Having cut my teeth on hundreds and hundreds of hours of Heroes 3 and Heroes 5, I really wanted to like this one.  It looks great, no doubt, but I'm afraid the magic is gone.  Enemy AI cheats to a game-breaking extent, so the only way to really experience this properly is to only play with other people.  Unfortunately, that's not generally desirable or workable online, due to UPlay's instability and the general unreliability of anonymous players in general, and 1v1 hotseat (or the like) is itself pretty limited and unsatisfying.  I miss the days of playing cooperatively with one or two other human players against the AI.The mechanics have also become problematically distorted, leading to too many unwinnable games where the growth of map creeps outpace your own troop production, or how suffering even incidental losses in too many map skirmishes can permanently doom your long-term war effort.  The idea of local forts/castles serving as the control point for local resource generators in the area was kind of nifty, and I could be okay with that depending on how it was implemented, but it feels too much like everything that formerly made this series great (particularly in HoMM3) has been gradually stretched, squashed, and otherwise mashed into some cheap imitation of its former glory.

												This was the biggest letdown of it's year. I expected a great new arc in the genre.But it's failed in so many ways, some up to personal opinion others less so. My opinion is based off of a comparison between this game and the games before it, Heroes III and V especially.The first and the defining failure in this game is the lackluster abilities and function of the heroes. In it's predecessors Heroes III and V, they could gain great power and spells that both were and felt awesome, as well as unique for their factions and style.Now, their abilities are all the same in the TWO different classes, and you'd be hard pressed to find any real difference between one hero and the next. They're called ""Heroes"" of Might and Magic, not Peasants of punches and fairy dust. Half the fun of the previous games was customizing a build with different schools of magic, but when all spells are ""balanced"" and every hero has the same there's no difference.The game was littered with bugs upon it's release, since then it may have received updates that have fixed them.There are only four resources. Once again, diversity and resource mechanics are taken out only to be replaced by a bland ""everyone uses the same"" resource called gold, wood stone and ""crystals"". Apparently, having different resources for different things is too hard.As for personal opinions which is a matter that must be taken with a grain of salt: The game seems very balanced to the point where similarities between the factions become too strong, and once again the diversity and innovation of the game is lost.The gameplay is decent, although occasionally slightly sluggish.Story's good, although very long. But that wouldn't be a complaint if one likes the game.Heroes VI is terrible because it has taken exactly what was fun about it's predecessors, the customization of Heroes and gaining immense powerful units, and made them all the same, fair, balanced and utterly boring.

												One of my favorite games of all time. I'd put it in my top 15, I would say. Yeah, its not AS good as Heroes of Might and Magic 3, but I still think its a pretty great time. The visuals are colorful, vibrant and very easy on the eyes. The gameplay was just as addicting as its always been in the HoMM series, wanting to do just one more turn before you left the game, eventually with the sun rising in your window. I also really liked the new addition of the Tears/Blood system, with getting special abilities depending on how you play and all that. I also loved the new faction, Sanctuary. Now, there are some missteps in all of this, of course. One, as the majority have mentioned, is the DRM. And I do have to agree that Uplay can be quite an annoyance, almost more so than Origin half the time. I will say that I have had less issues with it than I have had with Games for Windows Live, but that's not saying much. There is also a lack of factions. Not saying I need ten of them or anything, but just a couple more for a bit more variety. One of my favorite things to do as a kid was playing through all the different factions of HoMM 3, and wish I could have a similar experience with this one. Overall, I still think this game is worth picking up, especially with its sales prices. But if you really hate clients such as Uplay and Origin(which by all means, I understand) then I would say you should probably skip it, as it can cause issues. If not, and you enjoy strategy/turn based rpg's, then this is a great entry to a fantastic, venerable series. 9.4/10.			"

												It could just be that this is a bad entry in a good series or maybe I’m just not a Might and Magic fan but despite the amount of time I put in I don’t feel like I enjoyed it. The things that come back to me after not playing it for a while was the annoyance of having to be connected to the internet to play the game. Internet went out while you were playing? Too bad, you’ll have to continue your single player game later…Additionally, the game had a player progression system, a ‘Dynasty’, where you can collect heroes, weapons, and such. While nice the leveling was painfully slow, I never maxed out any of my weapons and you can see how many hours I put into it, which made it feel rather unrewarding.Lastly, I’ll just say that I personally don’t like over world strategy part of the game. The movement was annoying, especially since it’s best to keep all your troops in a single army so you’re prepared for anything. However, since there is almost never a single route an enemy army can sneak around and you’re hightailing it back to your cities to protect them before you have time to do the reverse. If you split up your army to cover your flank you don’t have enough troops to assault the enemy city.The combat was cool but half the time it was so highly dependent on pure numbers that it felt like if you lost a battle it wasn’t because you made a tactical error but that you should have managed your cities better and recruited more troops.

												This is a fun, turn based Strategy RPG focusing on controlling an Empire and the Heroes that you recruit. (CATEGORY) ""Poor/Sub-Par/Average/Great/Superb"" 1-5/5 - Description(OVERALL)- My personal rating for this game is 85%. My average rating for this is 71% (3.5/5)(GAMEPLAY)  ""Superb"" 5/5 - Battles are turn based tactics using a grid system, similar to games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Poxnora, Disgaea, Ogre Tactics, etc. Each turn you aquire resources depending on what mines/ect you've captured, and can spend those resources to upgrade your town(s). Your Heroes gain levels, and new abilities which are both passive, affecting the Army of Monsters you recruit at your town, or directly doing damage or providing some various effects (slowing down enemies, speeding yours up, summoning monsters to fight for you, etc). You end up fighting Neutral monsters that are stationary on the map, usually blocking your path as your armies are too weak (at first). Armies are formed from Monsters/Units that you pay to recruit (with gold) at your town/village. Each unit bought will represent a ""Stack"" of units. You have around 10 slots to have different types of creatures in your army, and you can have as many ""Stacks"" as you can afford / create to build up your forces. There are a huge variety of ways to play this game, all of which are really fun. Many elements of this game are comparable to a 4X game. (STORY)  ""Sub-Par"" 2/5 -There is a storymode to this game, and infact it is one of the best ways to get strong gear for your Hero. Gear aquired during those missions (and some other ways) allow you to make your Hero stronger, earlier, in any form of gameplay. The story isn't insanely good, but I found it to be very well done as far as being creative. Depending on what DLC you buy changes how much story you can access. This is one of the greater faults for the game. The story itself is something I like, however limiting it by DLC is not something that I favor. (Note, without some of the DLC (IE you bought Shades of Darkness, not the original) you will get a lot less content, which is why this is a 2/5)(GRAPHICS)  ""Average"" 3/5 - The graphics are quite good, but not amazing. There is enough going on in the world that it can draw you in, as a fantasy world. There are all sorts of odd buildings, and interactable objects. Exploration is one fun factor in the game (as there is Fog of War) and the graphics help tie in the feeling of exploration. Seeing the units in 3D during battle is always nice, and fun to watch (though if you have a slow-walking unit, try speeding up how fast your units move)(SOUND)  ""Great"" 4/5 - At first I was going to rate this a 3/5, but I realized that several of the songs in this game had gotten stuck in my head. Remembering that, it was a lot easier to rate this a 4/5. The Gameplay was addictive, and so is the music. Although it isn't anything over-the-top, or mind-blowing, it is still a fitting sound track. (ONLINE)  ""Sub-Par"" 2/5 - The games worst issue, by far. MMH VI has to be connected to the internet at all times to play the game. DRM-Stuff. This is a huge deterrant for most people, and thus have rated this section quite low. However on the flip side it has a great single player mode (which you still need to be connected to the internet to play) which you can setup your own matches against the NPC's and either destroy them, or be destroyed! It is a lot of fun learning tactics for certain maps, and for certain factions. (RE-PLAYABILITY) ""Superb"" 5/5 - This game is truly addictive. While I only have 40 hours in the game right now, it is because I haven't been able to re-install it and to get it working (with an issue others have had, a black screen) I haven't tried re-downloading and installing since I tried last. The game has a great sense of addictiveness to it. You earn new equipment to use on your Hero. Your hero gains new levels, and you can re-do it every match. You can play all sorts of different tactics, take your time or not, and generally, do what you want. (COST) ""Average"" 4/5 - This game costs either 30$ USD or 20$ USD (Depending on if you get the base game or Shades of Darkness) My review is based on Shades of Darkness. At 20$ USD, this is a steal of a game, as long as you don't mind staying connected to the internet. (OVERALL)- My personal rating for this game would likely be a 4/5. My average rating for this was a 3.5/5 or a 70%.			"

												I've mixed feelings about this game. Ever since spending countless hours playing Heroes of Might and Magic III and it's expansions/mods years ago,  I've been a fan. I love a good turn-based tactical combat based game. In fact, it may be my favorite genre. A strong strategy of collecting resources, helpful items and building powerful kingdoms backed by a solid story, good character dialogue, with outstanding art and soundtrack all mixed together, it's my opinion there is no topping this genre of game. Might and Magic: Heroes VI though falls short of legendary status for many reasons. Many avenues of this series have been simplified such as the resources, additions like the caravan options from HoMM IV and NPC monsters on the map being able to attack you during their turn if you are too close are missing. The story is nothing that held my interest and the dialogue happening in the pop-up screens was pretty horrible in many instances, and the in-game cutscene graphics are pretty generic. I did enjoy the map art and the soundtrack was okay. The gameplay is decent, though at many times not challenging. I had to crank up the difficulty to hard for any real strategy. On normal it can be difficult in the first few levels, but once you amass some powers/items/armies it's pretty much a steamroll. I played through 3 of the campaigns and towards the end of the 3rd I was getting bored and just selecting auto-battle and having minimal to no losses. I did like the inclusion of dynasty weapons, dynasty traits and having to open further slots and options by playing more and earning the achievement points. Again, there wasn't much of a challenge to the achievements other than just playing long enough to rack up enough kills/battles won without losses/ etc. Uplay is another barrier. Online activation to continue your game, if you do need/have to be offline you have to play a game started in offline mode.  I don't like to open my steam purchased game in two menus. Not a deal breaker for me, but annoying and unnecessary.I doubt I'll go back and play another full campaign. Perhaps, a random map here and there. Overall, it's just okay. Nothing spectatular that a turn-based strategy lover must have, but a worthy buy if you come across for cheap. "

												The single player is fun, very classic ""HoMM3"" if you will.  The campaign is ok, a little dry, but the gameplay is fun.  If you like playing single player HoMM3, you will really like this game.  Now, multiplayer is a cluster-f.  Trying to connect to other games, chat channels, ect...is an impossible mission, fraught with danger, failure, and really strange errors.  Good luck trying that option, odds are, you won't.Ubisoft abandoned the title, offering no more support, regardless of these bugs, and you are going to use uPlay AND Steam...look, that is just dumb.  uPlay is clunky and redundant with Steam.Mixed review, but because I like the SP that much, yes that much, I barely recommended this game.

												If you are a fan of turn-based tactical games, then this is a great entry in the genre, and even a better entry in the M&M series than the others to date.  M&M: Heroes 5 managed to hold my interest for somewhere around 15 to 20 hours, while I have enjoyed this one for almost 250 hours at the time of writing this review.The game does become fairly repetitive after a while, but its repetitiveness was not enough to put me off the game.  I typically get somewhere between 30 minutes to 5 hours out of a game, while games that I particularly enjoy might go as high as 60 or 70.  There is usually only one games each year that will get me to put in more than 40 hours, let alone the time I have invested into this game.I do find the UPlay dependence a bit obnoxious, as it sometimes takes up to a minute to get past the ""Checking for UPlay Updates"" screen (this on the latest system w/ SSD, 32gb RAM, 100mbit internet connection, etc.)  I was also disconnected partway through a major battle due to UPlay going offline.  I found this part to be inexcusable - it had a connection, let it reassert itself when it can but don't kick me out of the game!			"

												If you've played Heroes III, IV, or V, know that this game is better. Yes, even better than Heroes III. Balace is well done, each faction has abilities that make them distinct and fun to play, and the combat strategy becomes more customizable thanks to the skill trees that you can fill as your heroes level up. Campaigns are extensive - each takes about 20 hours to complete (I've only made it through two), and there are about five in the base game.The only probem with this game lies with Ubisoft's ""Conflux,"" an always-on social application that you must be connected to in order to play. It isn't intrusive, but it does mean that you need an internet connection to play, and if your internet cuts out, the game boots you out - even if you're in the middle of a 15 minute castle seige - and you have to reload the last save when you reconnect. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥, but it's ony a problem if you have unreliable internet.			"

												The AI cheats and is terribly unbalanced. The AI's armies will always be 2x-3x or more the size of your's, will be hitting for max (or closer to max) damage more often, and will whittle down your stack sizes faster than you ever can ever hope to. This is true even on the easiest settings.The tutorial campaigns are misleading, as the game seems balanced (if not a tad easy). Do not expect this to last long.Either take the time to download a cheat trainer (as there are no simple cheat codes) and cheat harder than the AI.... or just don't play.			"

												A fun, intuitive and challenging game, Heroes VI is my favourite in the series. The graphics are BEAUTIFUL and the real-time battle models look astounding. Battles are a mix of complicated turn-based, chess-like gameplay, with interesting, game-changing abilities. The maps are fun to explore and are filled with treasure and plenty of monsters to fight. One thing worth noting is the difficulty of the campaigns. The AI are smart and aggresive. So if you are are a fan of being  able to say, ""I've finished this game, good luck at doing it yourself"", then you will really enjoy this. Heroes VI is also great fun to play against friends. It features a hot-seat gametype which can be tedious if you don't like waiting for your slow friend, though the AI in Custom Game will be a worthy, oppenent in an actual player's stead. So, if you are a fan of expansive, challenging strategy games or enjoyed the other games in this series, this should be an memorable experience.			"

It's well balanced, plenty of factions to play, and overall a fun experience for anyone who likes fantasy strategy.			"

												Well, I'm sure this is a great game and an excellent means of entertainment. Sadly, I am unable to verify it from experience, since the game will not run for me - I am getting the infamous ""stopped working"" error message. After fighting with it for a bit, I give up. Ubisoft is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ that ruins gaming for its paying clients. I'm pirating this one as soon as I'm done typing. When pirated games are less of a hassle to play than legit copies, THAT'S WHEN YOU SHOULD THINK WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG.			"

												Would be wonderful game if there isn't that uPlay software needed to play. It's servers are often offline which causes all saves to be lost due to fact saved games are synced when you exit game.But speaking strictly about game, I'm a big fan of HOMAM series from HOMAM2 (played all of them) and I must say, this one is very close to playability of HOMAM3 (which is the best for me personally). It also adopted something from HOMAM4 (good parts). Campaign is very nicely done (not really short, fun to play, story is fine). In short, computer AI is not the worst, creatures are balanced and I must say, heroes and their leveling is really good.If you're a fan of HOMAM3/4 and you think you can stand uPlay, my recommendation is: Go for it "

Heroes skill sytem is complex and rewarding and the storyline is interesting enough to not be dismissed as ""generic"".I don't know what else to say, if you're a diehard Heroes fan like myself, don't listen to anyone else, give it a chance.

												A fun, intuitive and challenging game, Heroes VI is my favourite in the series. The graphics are BEAUTIFUL and the real-time battle models look astounding. Battles are a mix of complicated turn-based, chess-like gameplay, with interesting, game-changing abilities. The maps are fun to explore and are filled with treasure and plenty of monsters to fight. One thing worth noting is the difficulty of the campaigns. The AI are smart and aggresive. So if you are are a fan of being  able to say, ""I've finished this game, good luck at doing it yourself"", then you will really enjoy this. Heroes VI is also great fun to play against friends. It features a hot-seat gametype which can be tedious if you don't like waiting for your slow friend, though the AI in Custom Game will be a worthy, oppenent in an actual player's stead. So, if you are a fan of expansive, challenging strategy games or enjoyed the other games in this series, this should be an memorable experience.			"

												A good game in a great franchise ruined by a bad company.  You can see that I have a lot of hours logged into this game.  What you don't see is that a tremendous number of those hours are idle; I simply refused to log out because I thoroughly distrusted uPlay to the point of not believing I would ever be able to log back in if I logged out.  Previous experience justified that fear.  Subsequent experience validated it.  I finally had to reboot my machine.  Once again, I cannot get into the game because of uPlay.  The latest ""update"" to uPlay upgraded my experience by once again denying it to me entirely--as in, where I once could log on, I no longer can.When I was in the game, I was able to get through the first campaign and part of the second.  The game is a respectable member of the HOMM franchise but nothing truly revolutionary (the primary new element, dynasty weapons, is a good concept and I hope that it appears again, but it isn't exactly series-defining), and there are definite power balance issues among the factions.  Fortunately for beginners, you start playing the easiest (most powerful) faction (Necropolis), but the balance issues could be serious in multiplayer with random factions.The bottom line is simple: Not only do I not recommend this game for as long as uPlay exists, but I personally will not buy another Ubisoft title of any kind until they abandon or dramatically reform that system.  There are many excellent publishers out there that treat their customers with more respect, or failing that, if they force you to use proprietary portals, at least they function.			"

												I've grown up playing Heroes, and I have to say - this version is stupendous.  They brought back classic elements that were stripped from players in IV and V, and overhauled the interface.  The community HUB is a nice touch, giving players access to other players who are also playing, the cross hero artifacts are a nice bonus too, allowing me to play with any hero I want and still increase their strength.  The more I play, the stronger I'll get!The animations have been improved from V, and the voice acting is a lot better too!The load times are much improved also, and the time waiting for enemies to finish their turns is faster now too.One downside is U-Play.  Not very happy that I need to load U-Play to play the game when I bought it and play it through steam.  Besides that, it's a worthwhile game to play!			"

												First of all I would like to say I am disappointed and suprised about the excessive negative reviews. Luckily, I was able to purchase the complete edition of this game, I believe it is the Base + 3 expansions for just over $10. That is a lot of game for a small price tag, so I was willing to deal with any issues I found.Currently, I have played over 10 hours into this game and I have to say that I don't see what everyone else is belly-aching about. I see a lot of crying on the reviews, but in game I see nothing but positive.I run a PC with Windows 7 Professional, AMD 8-core processor, Geforce 545GT, so my rig is okay, but definitely not the best. I have not crashed once, no freezing, no glithes, no bugs, literally no issues.This game is visually stunning, challenging and engaging, very detailed, and FUN! You can really tell that some talented people put a ton of time into this game and it's mechanics. It's a lot like Warcraft 3, but it's very different too; you don't really fight directly with your hero, just your army and there is a vast variety of spells, abilities, weapons, gear and units to build and choose from, you also control and build a city.Now, don't get me wrong, this game isn't perfect, and there is some room for improvement. For instance, there is a lot to learn and the tutorial is fairly long and drags on a bit and if you take too much time building an army, you may find yourself unable to defeat the objectives due to overwhelming forces.This is just my two cents, but I really feel this game was given a bad rep by some people who didn't give it a fair chance or judged it based on things the game wasn't at fault for. Hope this helps.			"

												The AI cheats and is terribly unbalanced. The AI's armies will always be 2x-3x or more the size of your's, will be hitting for max (or closer to max) damage more often, and will whittle down your stack sizes faster than you ever can ever hope to. This is true even on the easiest settings.The tutorial campaigns are misleading, as the game seems balanced (if not a tad easy). Do not expect this to last long.Either take the time to download a cheat trainer (as there are no simple cheat codes) and cheat harder than the AI.... or just don't play.			"

												Graphics are pretty cool for a turn-based strategy, especially compared to the previous Heroes games. But in terms of gameplay everything is simplified - lower number of resources, common army pool, easy town portal for every hero etc. There are some good ideas like forts / zones of control, and even town conversion could be a pretty good idea if implemented in a different way (e.g. took several days, cost much more, and was not allowed for every castle in the game). But general impression is still not very good, considering that there are still some bugs in the game (4 years after release!), and that UPlay client is inconvenient and buggy (crashed on start immediately after installation, and kept crashing until I fixed some issues with file permissions - it is clearly written in a very bad style if it tries to write something into his own Program Files directory). But, if you're a fan of Heroes series - you should definitely try it out. It was still a lot of fun to me, especially playing new Dungeon faction - their creatures are very cool.			"

												The AI cheats and is terribly unbalanced. The AI's armies will always be 2x-3x or more the size of your's, will be hitting for max (or closer to max) damage more often, and will whittle down your stack sizes faster than you ever can ever hope to. This is true even on the easiest settings.The tutorial campaigns are misleading, as the game seems balanced (if not a tad easy). Do not expect this to last long.Either take the time to download a cheat trainer (as there are no simple cheat codes) and cheat harder than the AI.... or just don't play.			"

												Graphics are pretty cool for a turn-based strategy, especially compared to the previous Heroes games. But in terms of gameplay everything is simplified - lower number of resources, common army pool, easy town portal for every hero etc. There are some good ideas like forts / zones of control, and even town conversion could be a pretty good idea if implemented in a different way (e.g. took several days, cost much more, and was not allowed for every castle in the game). But general impression is still not very good, considering that there are still some bugs in the game (4 years after release!), and that UPlay client is inconvenient and buggy (crashed on start immediately after installation, and kept crashing until I fixed some issues with file permissions - it is clearly written in a very bad style if it tries to write something into his own Program Files directory). But, if you're a fan of Heroes series - you should definitely try it out. It was still a lot of fun to me, especially playing new Dungeon faction - their creatures are very cool.			"

												I wish I could play it. I was really looking forward to finally taste the M&M saga but I can't get through the uPlay stuff. It updated itself 3 times, then it starts crashing in 30-40 second. I was able to go though the registration in several attempts but then it turns out I've got the account but forgot the password. I let them to send me a reseting link and now it's been like several hours and nothing showed up. Remember, the uplay gui is crashing on me so time is ticking. It took me ages to rush thought the forms and did it in time before crash.I don't have patience for this and I already playing something else. I really don't understand the need for another system once it is on steam (other than monetization for the publisher - of course). I though once it's on steam, those game will be free of those things ;(If there will be some easy way to get my money back, I'll return everything fro the ubisoft weekend, since I can't play single damn thing because of uPlay. ;(			"

												Can't go through the 2nd mission on normal difficulty - OP opponent always has such a bigger army which don't give me any chances to beat him. Even if I won't visit any side neutral camps I will not beat him just cause of there is no way to increase your army, you can only buy 50 units per week. The game provides you idiotical experiance not to discover a map. I wasted 11 hours on this but I have no idea how to use magic how to buy extra troops etc. I don't know why there is so different plenty of resourses if you can't spend em on anything. Just a waste of time.Ive never player any other Heroes games but my friends who did it told me that in all games you can buy as many units as your resources allow you. Seems like Ive done a big mistake when bought this ♥♥♥♥.Btw if you want to play you must install Uplay and make an account in CONFLUX. That means 2 senseless registrations is indeed.

												Though I've not played anywhere NEAR as much as the time logged indicates, I will say - I have tried to like this game.  But, it's AI basically amounts to building armies at 3-4 times your rate.  Even on easy.  They aren't brilliant (I watched the last orc attacking my city, who was alrwady INSIDE the city, turn and attack the wall leading in).  They're just overtly numerous.  2-3 heroes with armies bigger than your main army can muster (again, even on easy for the Haven campaign) will be constantly on the attack, and in your zone.It's sad, because I've come back TRYING to like this game.  I'm not a Heroes III fanatic, in fact I didn't even play it.  But though I DID like Heroes V, I didn't judge this against it.  I'm merely saying an unfinished game at release was obviously glossed over as 'completed' by simply letting an ignorant AI outnumber you to your death.  I don't recommend.			"

												Well, Heroes 6 are far from being a good game, but it's not like they're that bad. As a big fan of the series I would place it above H4 for sure. It's hard to make it worse than 4th part. There is no Elves, no Mages, even that puny Elementals (I mean the castles) for me, it's a big flaw. This whole Dynasty thing, ok, it can be, I don't really mind. Not so many maps, even if we take these made by players. Of course Uplay is an issue, same as that Conflux thing. Generally it is still fun to spend couple of hours with Heroes but it's not the same any more, that game have lost it's magic. But i still would recomend it, just wait for good discount.			"

												Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a bit of a mixed bag in my honest opinion. Right off the bat I’ll say that, overall, the game is decent with enough content and unlockables to keep you occupied for a while. The various factions each focus on their own unique theme and due to this they also have different units to go along with it as well as heroes that can be adapted to your playstyle with the use of skill trees and reputation. This works just as well in the different campaigns where the reputation you choose for the main character will actually influence the story potentially giving you two different endings for each one. As good as this may sound the game isn't without issues that potentially ruin the whole experience (at least it did for me).Firstly it's worth mentioning that the game uses Uplay (a platform made by Ubisoft) as opposed to Steam meaning you have to register the game on a Uplay account as well. This was more of a slightly annoyance rather than a problem so I won't get too much into this point but I have heard that this has caused problems that seem to involve Uplay not accepting activation keys provided by Steam.The main problem I have with this game is the way the multiplayer was handled and how disappointing it was. I bought this game to play with a good friend but in our first game we quickly discovered that you couldn't watch battles being fought by other players (including allies). This means that every battle that your friend will take part in is another 5 minutes of having to sit there and watch the map as nothing happens (unless you both make use of the quick fight feature which I would recommend doing). This also means that you're forced to miss out on any significant battles between your friend and enemy heroes which may decide the outcome of a match. What? You actually wanted to see these two mighty armies clash? You wanted to laugh at your friend as he makes a bad move and gets a stack of his units killed or even see what his faction plays like? Too bad. You can't.The only way I can really recommend this game is as a single-player game which it seems to do well enough but as a multiplayer game it just feels like most matches (under normal circumstances) take longer than they should and even when you do finish it you look back and realise that the experience could have been much better. Regardless, if this game ever goes on sale and you are a fan of turn-based strategy games then I would still recommend it even if it's just for the campaign and the occasional skirmish against AI.

												Disclaimer: I have only played the single-player portion of the game.  Recaptures the feel and subtle complexity of the original Heroes game while adding larger tactical combat maps, additional inventory options, zones of control and swapable buildings in the cities.  The biggest weakness is the game's interface which can seem a bit awkward.  Overall, I'd recommend it, especially on sale.  Beware, however, as the game uses (and requires the installation of) Uplay, Ubisoft's DRM system.			"

												I'm really a fan of the atmospheric feel to this game. The originality in the art style is certainly there, while it is a classic fantasy, it still feels like a fresh apporach to a long loved genre.As for the gameplay: While I honestly have no idea what I am doing, I am enjoying the combat system. Town managment has depth but is not overwealming. Map exploration feels very rewarding. I feel that the AI could be a little better and I really wish that I didn't have to deal with Uplay in order to play this game. But other than that I would reccomend this if you are a fan of RPG/Strategy games.			"

												My only complaint is that all the maps are pregenerated - you can't generate random maps.The gameplay is a balancing act of economy building which is pretty subtle.  I lost an easy map 3 times before figuring out a way that worked (and even then I might have just gotten lucky).The music is excellent - which means a lot coming from me.  I'm very picky about music.Also the artwork is very well done and nice to come back to.This is not a TBS like Civilization, because the maps are very linear and sort of contrived.  You can't build as many cities as you want - everything is fixed on the maps.  But it's still FUN and really artful and some of the artwork is so good I'll forget about the game for months and then an image pops up in my head and I want to play this again.The tactics are interesting because some units take up more than a single square - like 2x2.  In those cases you can set up shielding formations to protect your most important units, maybe other cases too.Yes buy it.Also... as far as Uplay goes... yes it's a pain in the ♥♥♥, but so is Steam.  It's just another platform and this is just the way developers do marketting.  I don't care.  I can still get to the gameplay and I enjoy it once I get there.  That's all I care about.  Uplay IS a pain in the ♥♥♥ though - they want to suggest 2-step verification.  Guess what Uplay - this is a ♥♥♥♥ing game not a bank account I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about your stupide 2-step verification ideas!			"

												I had decided to withhold a review of this game because I didn't want to undermine the release of HOMM7 but since metacritic scores say HOMM7 is crap anyways I will go ahead and review.As far as pro and cons go it is easier to criticize than to praise. I will try and cover good points first.- This game is a huge time sink. Games that are huge time sinks are good at what they do.- The maps are well decorated.- The combat for haven town has some depth.- The AI can play a good game of cat and mouse on the world map for forts and places equidistant between two forts or a fort and a town or two towns.- The faction ability adds some depth to combat.- Some hero spells can make combat more strategic.- Movement speed of units on the map and in combat can be sped up in options.As for the cons:Simply put the game is over streamlined. Because of this it becomes very lather rinse repeat.- No matter what you play your first two hero skills are likely going to be +20% gold and +3 movement since a critical part of the game is amassing resources and building your city up quickly. The difference between doing this and not doing this is quite large. It can be the difference between a steamroller and attrition.- The hero customization is very MMOey. It doesn't really provide any kind of uniqueness to your heroes. If you're a warrior class you will likely use the same skill set every game with mass stone skin and maybe some other spell thrown in. If you are a mage there is somewhat more customization but it really comes down to a combination of summons to block ranged units, some kind of healing spell, maybe nukes but nukes tend to fade away in effectiveness as armies get bigger, and again mass stoneskin.- The game map is very streamlined. You can usually get away with a vanguard hero and a scout. Mines are only relevant as far as clearing them is concerned. Everything revolves around forts and towns. And thus the game is about the +20% gold and +3 movement at the start and building up as quickly as possible and then vanguard hero sniping. You can plunder and sabatoge mines but it is usually out of the way and at best forces a player to gate. At worst they simply step out of their town and kill your hero.- Aside from the haven town where vestals become important you can do most of the game with quick combat turned on. As a result most of the critical gameplay happens on the world map which is over streamlined with towns and forts and revolves around vanguard hero sniping.The unit trees are quite linear. With only three resources unit build-up usually follows the same pattern. The only real curveball is deciding when to build your warpgate.Hero leveling is mostly irrelevant in the campaigns. You are either a level 15 hero or not a level 15 hero.Converting towns is another element that over streamlines the game. I don't see an option to turn it off in any menu so no mixed unit tactics.To conclude a very streamlined game that revolves around linear build-up and vanguard hero sniping with little hero uniqueness and few strategic goals on the world map. However it is a hefty timesink and simple can be fun.			"

												Not a bad game. Could of done a lot more with things, Some of the units aren't the best. I enjoy the game i have played might and magic for a long time. Like honestly im pretty sure i played might and magic 1 which has been forever ago. I felt like it was a good idea with blood and teir perks just they should of capitalized on it more. Also the leveling is kinda weird, fun but weird. Its a game worth trying out, if i could id get VII but its processer takes maybe to much so idk if i wanna buy it. But only thing that bothered me about this game is not many factions to choose from and if you do, hell, haven, necropolis are the strongest. Strong hold is okay but it lacks early game. The water people are pretty cool but sadly their one of the more weaker factions to pick sorry can't remember their name. Honestly i think haven and necropolis is probably the strongest ouf of them all. Hell is really strong but u gotta try to get devils soon as possible cause their a great unit, as well as building up good range. Its a good game, its put down a lot but im sure you would truly enjoy it. My only tip is tho, just have fun don't expect much, And do not go into maps that are layered like underground stuff cause there is a lot of bugs underground. Hope this review helps :)			"

												Ubisoft sucks, but this game isn't as bad as people are making it sound. It isn't as good as most of the previous entries, but it is still enjoyable to play. I had a lot of fun with most of the campaign levels and unlocking heroes and leveling equipment (which carries over between different campaigns). I would say this was a step in the wrong direction, but still very playable and enjoyable, especially if you enjoy this genre or previous HOMM games. I would say 3 and 4 will probably always be my favorites with 2 close behind, but I actually prefer this over 5. Anyway, I think it is easily worth $20 bucks.7/10 Not as good as previous entries in the series, but not horrible either.			"

Probably the Best ""Heroes"" since HMM III.PreambleBeing a massive fan of HMMIII, and having played all the following games in the series (Except M&M: HVII) I would rather warmly recommend M&M:HVI.While the game was first plagued by game breaking issues courtesy of Ubisoft's dodgy DRM, numerous bugs, and a lack of Town screen which caused an uproar when the game first released, these problems were eventually addressed. I think a lot of the negative reviews date back to the olden days of 2011 In my infinite wisdom, I only bought the game a year or so after it released, and my experience was only slightly mired by the innate DRM and Conflux systems. I've not played all the DLC content available today for M&M:HVI, only Shades of Darkness (SoD), so this is the scope of this review.  The GoodThe campaigns are interesting overall, with some of them really shining as possibly the best campaigns  in the entire series. This is particularly true for the SoD extension which was thoroughly enjoyable in my opinion. I liked as well that the main heroes in campaigns are related to the other heroes by an overarching story frame, which - to boot - allows you to play the campaigns in pretty much any order. The game also includes the ""Dynasty system"" allowing you to unlock Heroes and additional bonuses that can then be used in multiplayer and other modes, as well as weapons and pets for your campaign Heroes.Last but not least, also included is a Karma system of sorts which, through your choices and actions, allows to you to gear your main Heroes towards super-good or mega-evil, thus gaining equally good or evil superpowers. This is a tiered system, which at first provides small but useful advantages, but by the time you reach the last scenario in a campaign will give your Hero some massive bonuses. This adds another level of customization to your heroes and provides some replay value for the campaigns. The profusion of ways in which your Heroes can be tweaked, upgraded and customized will give the min-maxers a great time. Graphics and audio are pretty good, though some of the voice acting can be a bit off-putting at times, but overall the presentation is pretty good. The gameplay, exploration, city management, kingdom building, hero development are all very enjoyable. The battle system while being very classic is also very enjoyable thanks to a clear interface, nice graphics and animations (which after a few hours you will certainly want to speed up !)The BadOn the downside, you have to bear with an ""AI"", which at times is so obviously scripted that it becomes a bit of an immersion breaker. (Hello Inferno campaign!). The Truly EvilAh! UBISOFT darling when will you understand that such heavy handed DRM only affects the people who actually purchase your games? We're not in 1990 anymore when everyone was burning ""backup"" copies of games and ""lending"" them to our friends! We have the internet and we have smarts! We can download in a few mere minutes DRM-free versions of your games and enjoy their content without your annoying, crippling, absurd and utterly pointless DRM!To the point, Uplay, the DRM, should really be called Udontplay, because frankly it can be pretty hard to get the game to start after installing it. Thankfully in most cases you will find the solution in this here forum or on the web.ConclusionLastly, once you are past the DRM Gates of Hell, Heroes VI, offers great gameplay and a huge amount of content to play through, even more so nowadays with all DLCs available. Overall, with 313 hours on my counter, I must say I have very much enjoyed Heroes VI + SoD, more so than any other since the days of HMMIII. (Excluding Heroes VII- which, in my still infinite wisdom, I will not buy before Ubi gets their game together so to speak.)			"

												I would like to give this game a good review, I really would seeing as the Might and Magic series is something I played many years ago and enjoyed however I just cannot here.The simple fact of the matter is Uplay is the worst thing to ever happen to gaming and has no place existing whatsoever. Despite buying this game through steam you will have to go through the Uplay platform in order to play it and Uplay is just not gaming, or anyone for that matter, friendly.I have barely been able to play this game to its fullest as Uplay HATES routers and trying to use any online functions connecting via a router will meet you with a brick wall ""cannot connect to servers"" message with staff members telling you to go through a lengthy and potentailly dangerous (if you have no idea what you're doing) process of port forwarding your router.The second reason I have barely been able to play the game is because the games response to a connection drop is the most insulting thing I have ever seen. I played a level for some time without saving and my router crashed, at which point I was kicked out of my game, sent to the main menu and to my horror found that my entire progress was deleted. I managed to recover this by playing the ""offline"" function but even the ""offline"" mode is created in such a way to PUNISH the player for daring to oppose using Uplay services as by playing offline you cannot access many functions of the game.Unless Uplay is removed and replaced with Steam servers or is fixed to actually work my only advice unless you use a direct internet connection or are routing savvy is to just avoid the game altogether and break out your old Might and Magic games which were created in a day when companies didn't hate gamers.

												I just stopped playing this game because the game has been repeatedly crashing when the AI town portals to one of its towns. I would have to restart the mission at this point and hope that it doesn't happen again. At this point, I think I'm done. I've experienced crashes when trying to play this game at other times, as well. The fact that the game crashes and has to be reset in order to avoid crash scenarios is enough to give it a negative review regardless of what other features it may have.			"

												This game isn't available on Steam.  Installation of this game will, however, install a crude Steam clone that can in turn be used to launch the game.I don't have much to say about the game itself.  Attempting to launch the game, even from Ubisoft's Steam clone, exposed a wall of marketing gimmicks with no immediately obvious way to actually play the game.All-and-all, I feel like an idiot for spending money on this title.

												I don't understand all of the negative reviews of this game. It isn't on par with, say, MM3 but it is a very fun and addictive game as well with it's own unique charm. The graphics are great, the gameplay is tweaked but maintains the classic Heroes vibe. All the DLC is a bit of a turn off and the lack of custom map making is a step backwards but overall it is a good addition to the universe.A lot of people complain about Uplay but I have not experienced any of these problems. Perhaps the complaints are outdated? I can play online without issue, Uplay functions perfectly. I have had one instance of a game crash but that was after hours of play and enabling the daily save feature makes it so that the odd crash really isn't much of an issue.  "

												It's a shame that the whole Might & Magic and Heroes of Might & Magic franchise isn't on steam because the previous games are so much better.I'd love so much to play the original heroes of might and magic as well as the might and magic games on steam.At least, almost all of them are available on Gog.comIt's better than what people says but it's not the greatest game in its genre, the previous ones were better In my opinion and there are games like Age of Wonders which is pretty similar but the unit system is different but this game is still good and worth to play, it's pretty long and can be pretty hard on the hardest difficulty though, even impossible sometimes.It's a good game that I would suggest to any fans of Heroes of Might & Magic, strategy games and perhaps as a Might & Magic game.7/10			"

												NOPEJust... no.What a flaming pile of dung. After spending way too many of my precious and limited ""free time"" trying to diagnose and correct an intrinsic connection issue with the game, it depends too heavily on the Ubisoft ""UPLAY"" (more like UCANNOTPLAY) software to function. Since this is a game I bought on Steam, it appears that the two launchers just are not compatible. I could spend several more hours and probably get it to work, but why bother? I have enough OTHER games to play that this isn't worth my time - nor is it worth anyone else's, either.			"

Is this a direct result of Console Peasents buying more PCs, or is the Master Race not as L33t as they assumed?What can I say though? Better than V in every way, with Blackhole getting very close to mirroring the original feel and mechanics that made this series great. Is this III or IV worthy? Hardly... But it's a start in the right direction, and Hot Seat and MP is as memoriable as ever. Story is meh, but such is the way of HoMM. Hours of fun ... if you know where to spend those hours.			"

												Do not buy this game.My PC is an i7, 3GHz, 24GB of ram and a GeForce 960 1GB video adapterPlaying on high graphics settings is not possible as I never get 30fps. Then I tried low graphics and I get 70fps, except every time I move my hero it goes down to 20fps.I am able to play games like Shadow of Mordor on full graphics without a glitch. How is that possible??The DRM is terrible, having to install UPlay and be always online is outrageous.Loading times are very long.Sometimes textures are missing from the game and I can see the checkered placeholder instead.I am a big fan of the Heroes franchise but what Ubisoft has done here is at best a wannabe that should be forgotten.The 20 hours I have on record are already too many for what this game deservesI would be ashamed of releasing anything like this as an indie/garage developer.On top of that it has been 5 years and every couple of years I come back to the game hoping for a patch that would make it playable. Instead they release and charge for 2 more expansions of the same crap.I guess I'm giving up. I'll uninstall it finally and will probably not buy the next one either, because to me this feels like a scam.			"

Awful cities as before as after the patch 2) Sometimes inappropriate units' voices 3) Somewhat lazy made storyline in main campaingsI recommend this game to every heroes series' fan (exept those who like thirds and thirds only) and to everyone who likes strategies. If you've played thirds' fourths and fifths at least try to give this game a chance. I too was very angry at developers at first for their innovations, but after a few days i understood that this game is good, despite all negative sides (Cities). Looking back now, i regret that i didn't bought this game before, when Blackhole studios (original developers) still existed.			"

												I just finished the HoMM V after playing it for the first time this weekend.And loved the game so much I bought the Hammers of Fate expansion as well as HoMM VI and also started playing HoMM Online as well.Way back in 2002 I had purchased what I believe was HoMM IV, my first HoMM game and I recall within minutes not liking it, deleting it and for the next 13 years avoiding all HoMM titles.GEEEEEEZZZZZ, what was I thinking!?!On a whim, I played Kings Bounty for the first time last Friday, ""KB: Legend""...I loved it !And also was happy to find out that HoMM and KB are related.This got me thinking to give HoMM a 2nd chance, so I bought HoMM V and OMG I love it!I could not stop playing it!Although, I finished it, I still have Hammer of Fate to play.But, that could not stop me from wanting to try HoMM VI with its upgraded graphics.My initial hesitation on Steam to return to HoMM games was due to mixed reviews regarding the versions of HoMM that require the infamous ""UPlay"".But, being a techie I was determined to not let UPlay ruin my fun.Despite, not being able to play HoMM VI due to a UPlay error, that caused me to RAGE, I was able to get it to run with the help of our Steam forum members.As a result, I LOVE HoMM VI as well!1) Updated graphics2) Beautiful Sound Track3) Plays just like HoMM V, but with some changes that others complained about, but I do not mind.My only complaints thus far is that the voice acting is not as good as HoMM V, the Orc sounds downright cheesey. And of course the cinstant connection, Conflux and UPlay all adding to disk usage and duplicating Steam.if you never played a HoMM game before, let me tell you that the game design is very uniquer and fun and is being imitated by other games.For me, the allure is the way the game switches from strategic view to tactical view where the battles are fought.Loving it			"

												DON'T BUY THIS BROKEN MESS, even at 4.99 it isn't worth it.Let me  explain . Heroes III was one of the first videogames I played, and I loved the series ever since. This one is a joke,the AI cheating is ridiculous , they have absolute vision , free troops every week or even day and if you fight them when you're supposed to win , they'll just flee and not lose troops. I even encountered a time when I had 2 castles and the deadly enemy hero came , I was in one castle so he went on to the other , I used town portal to defend my other castle and he just went for the first castle ( he never went that far , so he shouldn't know where my hero is ) and that process was repeated infinitely.This is cheap and unfortunate since the creature and world design is great and a good innovation from the previous titles. The leveling system is convoluted but offers some freedom.			"

												The game is fantastic, but like everything else ubisoft touches its turned to ♥♥♥♥ by their god aweful uplay system. I must say the game ran fine for the first 21 hours of gameplay, However after that I was unable to access any content or even switch the game to offline mode. Ubisofts uplay software is pure s***, and unfortunately this is another slap in the face to heroes fans. I am happy to say I will never under any circumstances being purchasing another Ubisoft game, and i highly recomend that you don't either.			"

												This game is utter crap compared to its predecessors.   The AI cheats, doesn't play anything like you do.  It does not build up fairly or normally, has insta-armies and unlimited income.  So you cannot attrition them.Every mission, you end up ending turn like 50 times to get powerul enough to defeat the boss.Neutral monsters gain stacks like mad as well, I'm talking 20 thousand of a unit.  It is as if the game was not playtested at all.Total junk, would not recommend to anyone.The only good thing is the hero levelling system tree is well done.			"

												I haven't yet played the game to completion, and I have picked it up for the sake of story completion, however if you played V and its expansions, prepare for disappointment...On the plus side, the game is visually pretty, like all HoMM games. The two hero option per faction has been restored, in the vein of III, which is great. The hero pathway has become more defined, but I can't help but feel it is more homogeneised now, and not as impressive as V's skill system. It provides more options for the player to choose whether to rely on might or magic, so you don't have oddities like a Warlock hero focusing on unit-oriented abilities, and can instead take a hero suited to this path. Sandro is also back!VI also brought in the Naga as a faction, who I find interesting.On the negative side, I feel the battle system is simplistic compared to V's. Most units have had their abilities stripped down, and V's awesome system of two upgrade options per unit (introduced in ToTE, IIRC) is gone. Many of the factions have had their unit makeup shaken up and a distinction between ""core"" and ""elite"" units, which has always existed, at least on an informal basis. Again, I feel V has it beaten on this aspect. The Sylvan and Academy didn't make it in. I've little love for Stronghold, which ToTE brought in, and their exclusion for this faction did little to appease me. The artwork and music of V was far grander and of a higher quality. All in all, it's slightly above average, and I'd give it a 6/10. I'm hoping VII will revert to the pathway carved out by V, which was an excellent attempt by Ubisoft at remaking this series to its own liking.			"

												As for the bugs and ""OMG UPLAY DRM? UBI PLS DIE! OMGG CONFLUX NOOBS"":A lot of complaining from a lot of people who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of. Give them no heed! Sure, it's tied with Uplay, but I like it. My game crashed the second I launched it. Googled uplay fix, they told me run uplay as admin not through steam, and it worked like a charm. I have no issues opening from steam directly anymore. If you want to play offline, you still can, but be careful that online/offline saves are not the same! If you start someway, stick with it! (though it has no consumption at all, so you might as well just use your 3G)As for the actual game:It's a great game, nice challenege, amazing graphics and HUD, pretty decent story (as far as video games go). I've played Heroes 5, and I can honestly say I liked this one more. Combar is more intuitive (no, the same creature can not act a billion times before your creature gets a turn), you can see info about every creature on the battlefield directly in a MUCH neater way than before (including what's affecting them and what that thing is) -- like I said, amazing HUD. Gameplay will get boring if you spend all your time waiting around for reinforcements! If you're playing it right, you should never be just waiting around.Magic is now a little less varied but more reliable (you pick what you want to learn and spend a 'skill point' rather than getting random ones in guilds) Same for skill level up. You have a build in mind? Go with it, don't hope you get the relavant skill when you level up.You can also convert towns (THANK YOU!), and summon creatures produced in multiple towns from the same town (no caravans, no 20 sub heroes shipping to the same main hero, just one place and go on with your life)Oh, and once more, the HUD is really really nice. It feels so fluid (unlike the VII one, sadly).No one online for multiplayer though, so don't buy it if that's your aim, but I'd definately recommend the game.			"

												I think it's the most perfect game of all Heroes of Might and Magic series. The graphics, the campaign story, the creatures - i love it all! I would love that they would fix a few bugs here and there and maybe add a new Race, but in overall it's a fantastic game.			"

												Turn Based Strategy / Fantasy*Important BugsOverall 3 out of 5Complexity 3Graphics 3Immersive 3Inovative 3Game Pace 2This is a hard call between recommending or not, but at the end I think it is worth the money if you find a good discount.To make it easier I split the review in pro and against.Pro:This is very much like the original games, the ones that got very popular, with the addition of a relevant achievement system.There is this extra layer to the game where you create your heroes and give them the habilities, and as you play you do not only level in game but you also level your profile and acquire in game coins. This profile leveling allows you to expand the set of options for your heroe and the coins to acquire more habilities and other stuff for your set.It's interesting and fun developing your profile as if it as an in game character, and it gives extra game hours.The game itself is pretty much like the series, you have castles, armies, heroes and resources and you are in a row for conquering it all. The AI is decent enough, the creatures have a nice variation of habilities and magic is interesting although narrow.If you like the series, this is a good call. I personally didn't like the Heroes V, but this one I did. There's plenty hours of game in.Against:Ubisoft have been showing a tendency to shady business in recent developments, and this seems pretty much it.The games have loads of bugs that will probably never be fixed, it crashes, hangs, etc. also the Uplay is mandatory for this game, but there are bugs syncronising content making the loading a pain. Almost every time I open the game I have to wait for a long attempt to syncronise content with their server, eventually it fails for time out, and only then I can play.Another hint that Ubisoft do not really care much for fair play is that this is not a full version. You'll not find the Dungeon available, the only way to get this is to buy another fully independent game by a price way above a game pack. I'm also not sure if this is the only thing missing as I originally bought two game packs along with this because of a sale.Bugs and shady business aside there's one more annoyance, if you are a fan of multiplayer or stand alone, to take the most of the game you'll have to at least play one campaing with your favourite race, aside the introductory campaing. This is the only way to unlock some special items that will be attached to your account.The introdutoring campain is boring like hell but is ""short"", the race campain I can only tell about the Undead which is not bad.All in all, there's no other game like this. Falling Enchantress gets close to beat Heroes, but it misses some fundamental stuff. Others are too simple to be interesting for long... so in my opinion this is worth for the simple reason that there's no competitors for this game style, specially if you want to play with friends.If you are looking at games at random and not after this game style in specific, then stay away.

												Ah... Heroes of Might and Magic 6. Now this game is amazing! Some may say that the new castle system is weird or bad or just completely messed up BUT this game is the step from the Heroes 4 and 5 back in teh way of heroes 3 which, as many say, was the best of them all. As many of us know by now, game requires much more than flashy graphics and cool animations to provide good and stimulating gameplay. Esspecially if it is a strategy game where you can just skip the combat (not that anyone who knows how to play does it) and you see the same animation over and over in a long campaign. And frankly I think Heroes 6 delivers. The new addition of Dynasty is interesting but considering the Ubisoft features and the Conflux with it along with all the facebook liking and skype shenanigans might have been a step too far towards the community. The thought is good but I'm pretty sure we all know how to switch on skype... I hope.  But concerning the game: Briliant! Esspecially if you want to play with more people online in a set up party. Great castles, very very well worked through passive abilities and active abilities in mosters and amazing heroes with teh new Blood and Tears system! Definitely worth the money			"

												First off I want to say this is the second Might &Magic Heroes game I have played. The other game is the third game.Compared to the third game this is garbage. So I would recommend any one thinking about buying this game to buy the third and play that instead.  Gamewise they feel a little different. Pros:* It has quite good graphics, the battles look cool.* The battles are still as epic.* It gets cheap when there is a sale.Cons:* I felt VI feels to narrow. * There are no open areas just small corridors. If you want to get from one point to another there are only a few corridors you can take.* Uplay.So to summaries I would not recommend you to buy this game for full price. IF it is one 75% sale then yes it is worth the money. But otherwise I would recommend the third game in the series.			"

												I'm a little disappointed in Ubisoft for taking the Heroes series in kind of a weird direction. If you enjoyed the prior ""Heroes"" games for things like the cityscapes, faction details, and down-to-earth plots, you won't find all that much of those things in ""Heroes VI"". What you will find is over-the-top unit designs and a lot of the current trend to make the bad guys seem not so bad after all. The Inferno Faction has really suffered in that regard - it's not so much evil and demons as it is a bunch of misunderstood guys with horns.Gameplay, though - that's what's remained true to all the previous ""Heroes"" games, and the developers did a lot to expand on the options available to a Hero in terms of the skills and powers they can develop.

												Game was not what I've expected. Diplomacy DOESNT work! That was my favorite part about Heroes 3 when the creatures decide to join your army if it's strong enough. Op? Maybe, I don't care, it was fun as hell.Otherwise story and gameplay was boring, couldn't even finish it.Don't buy VII too, I've heard it's even worse.			"

												As for the bugs and ""OMG UPLAY DRM? UBI PLS DIE! OMGG CONFLUX NOOBS"":A lot of complaining from a lot of people who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of. Give them no heed! Sure, it's tied with Uplay, but I like it. My game crashed the second I launched it. Googled uplay fix, they told me run uplay as admin not through steam, and it worked like a charm. I have no issues opening from steam directly anymore. If you want to play offline, you still can, but be careful that online/offline saves are not the same! If you start someway, stick with it! (though it has no consumption at all, so you might as well just use your 3G)As for the actual game:It's a great game, nice challenege, amazing graphics and HUD, pretty decent story (as far as video games go). I've played Heroes 5, and I can honestly say I liked this one more. Combar is more intuitive (no, the same creature can not act a billion times before your creature gets a turn), you can see info about every creature on the battlefield directly in a MUCH neater way than before (including what's affecting them and what that thing is) -- like I said, amazing HUD. Gameplay will get boring if you spend all your time waiting around for reinforcements! If you're playing it right, you should never be just waiting around.Magic is now a little less varied but more reliable (you pick what you want to learn and spend a 'skill point' rather than getting random ones in guilds) Same for skill level up. You have a build in mind? Go with it, don't hope you get the relavant skill when you level up.You can also convert towns (THANK YOU!), and summon creatures produced in multiple towns from the same town (no caravans, no 20 sub heroes shipping to the same main hero, just one place and go on with your life)Oh, and once more, the HUD is really really nice. It feels so fluid (unlike the VII one, sadly).No one online for multiplayer though, so don't buy it if that's your aim, but I'd definately recommend the game.			"

												First review I've ever made about a game. I like the game and am lucky that I am able to actually play it. The main problem is of course Uplay. You cannot play the game offline you only get the ""demo"" if you are offline. If you get disconnected while playing you get pushed to the main menu and can only play the ""demo"" again. My first computer I played this on I couldn't get past the Uplay launcher which was annoying. Current computer every so often the game just stops functioning and says its loading. Which means exiting the game and relaunching it. Soon as I beat it and the expansions I plan to never touch it again. Its honestly a waste of money for a game almost 50% of the people cannot play due to Uplay. I did notice that the bugs in it from when I first managed to play successfully are still around. Overall 1/5 because I like the series and am able to play. -1 gameplay -1 bugs -1 uplay -1 have to be online 100% of the time.			"

												First off I want to say this is the second Might &Magic Heroes game I have played. The other game is the third game.Compared to the third game this is garbage. So I would recommend any one thinking about buying this game to buy the third and play that instead.  Gamewise they feel a little different. Pros:* It has quite good graphics, the battles look cool.* The battles are still as epic.* It gets cheap when there is a sale.Cons:* I felt VI feels to narrow. * There are no open areas just small corridors. If you want to get from one point to another there are only a few corridors you can take.* Uplay.So to summaries I would not recommend you to buy this game for full price. IF it is one 75% sale then yes it is worth the money. But otherwise I would recommend the third game in the series.			"

												I'm a little disappointed in Ubisoft for taking the Heroes series in kind of a weird direction. If you enjoyed the prior ""Heroes"" games for things like the cityscapes, faction details, and down-to-earth plots, you won't find all that much of those things in ""Heroes VI"". What you will find is over-the-top unit designs and a lot of the current trend to make the bad guys seem not so bad after all. The Inferno Faction has really suffered in that regard - it's not so much evil and demons as it is a bunch of misunderstood guys with horns.Gameplay, though - that's what's remained true to all the previous ""Heroes"" games, and the developers did a lot to expand on the options available to a Hero in terms of the skills and powers they can develop. The AI is a bit smarter, and the game can be very challenging if you don't stay on the ball in the early parts of missions. Some units are a lot more useful than others, and the factions have been homogenized a little bit, and there are only five...			"

												Turn Based Strategy / Fantasy*Important BugsOverall 3 out of 5Complexity 3Graphics 3Immersive 3Inovative 3Game Pace 2This is a hard call between recommending or not, but at the end I think it is worth the money if you find a good discount.To make it easier I split the review in pro and against.Pro:This is very much like the original games, the ones that got very popular, with the addition of a relevant achievement system.There is this extra layer to the game where you create your heroes and give them the habilities, and as you play you do not only level in game but you also level your profile and acquire in game coins. This profile leveling allows you to expand the set of options for your heroe and the coins to acquire more habilities and other stuff for your set.It's interesting and fun developing your profile as if it as an in game character, and it gives extra game hours.The game itself is pretty much like the series, you have castles, armies, heroes and resources and you are in a row for conquering it all. The AI is decent enough, the creatures have a nice variation of habilities and magic is interesting although narrow.If you like the series, this is a good call. I personally didn't like the Heroes V, but this one I did. There's plenty hours of game in.Against:Ubisoft have been showing a tendency to shady business in recent developments, and this seems pretty much it.The games have loads of bugs that will probably never be fixed, it crashes, hangs, etc. also the Uplay is mandatory for this game, but there are bugs syncronising content making the loading a pain. Almost every time I open the game I have to wait for a long attempt to syncronise content with their server, eventually it fails for time out, and only then I can play.Another hint that Ubisoft do not really care much for fair play is that this is not a full version. You'll not find the Dungeon available, the only way to get this is to buy another fully independent game by a price way above a game pack. I'm also not sure if this is the only thing missing as I originally bought two game packs along with this because of a sale.Bugs and shady business aside there's one more annoyance, if you are a fan of multiplayer or stand alone, to take the most of the game you'll have to at least play one campaing with your favourite race, aside the introductory campaing. This is the only way to unlock some special items that will be attached to your account.The introdutoring campain is boring like hell but is ""short"", the race campain I can only tell about the Undead which is not bad.All in all, there's no other game like this. Falling Enchantress gets close to beat Heroes, but it misses some fundamental stuff. Others are too simple to be interesting for long... so in my opinion this is worth for the simple reason that there's no competitors for this game style, specially if you want to play with friends.If you are looking at games at random and not after this game style in specific, then stay away.

												Ah... Heroes of Might and Magic 6. Now this game is amazing! Some may say that the new castle system is weird or bad or just completely messed up BUT this game is the step from the Heroes 4 and 5 back in teh way of heroes 3 which, as many say, was the best of them all. As many of us know by now, game requires much more than flashy graphics and cool animations to provide good and stimulating gameplay. Esspecially if it is a strategy game where you can just skip the combat (not that anyone who knows how to play does it) and you see the same animation over and over in a long campaign. And frankly I think Heroes 6 delivers. The new addition of Dynasty is interesting but considering the Ubisoft features and the Conflux with it along with all the facebook liking and skype shenanigans might have been a step too far towards the community. The thought is good but I'm pretty sure we all know how to switch on skype... I hope.  But concerning the game: Briliant! Esspecially if you want to play with more people online in a set up party. Great castles, very very well worked through passive abilities and active abilities in mosters and amazing heroes with teh new Blood and Tears system! Definitely worth the money			"

												I'll be straightforward.I don't have a problem with the ubi launcher. It's a fail, but it does the job done. When it works.I don't have a problem with the dumped down resources. Although i prefer the old system, i can live with it.I don't have a problem with difficulty in general. Sometimes it can get rediculous, but you can also change it to easy.Where i do have the problem though, is with the games core mechanic that increases enemies army size every week like the players. It may look nice on paper and you can dump it down a little through difficult settings, but if you take your time (like me) wandering around the beautiful crafted map, or sometimes just killing every army you encounter, you'll hit sooner or later an overpowered enemy wall that you cannot cross.This is by the far the worse thing in the game in my opinion. It forces you to play fast and precise, otherwise you may end up in a really tight situation. Why? Why in earth can't i define my own game pace? It makes no sense. And if they liked that mechanism so much, why don't they just put a slider or something so the players can adjust in a precise way the amount of reinforcements enemies can get? Bad design choice.Apart of this, the game is nice with all it's problems. And it has lots, just read the following reviews. But it's also fun, has gorgeous graphics and a beautiful designed enviroment. Oh and the animations, are one of the best i've seen, kudos to the animation team/studio.It's a good game, full of bad design choices. A  5/10  from a series veteran.A solid  7/10  for the newcomers or the ones who simply don't care.			"

												I love the M&M series and have been playing it since HOMM 2 (I later went and purchased the bundle pack of HOMM 2 so I could experience HOMM 1). This game brings alot of changes to the series and I personally like the fresh take on the series. Major changes include, the new leveling system, spell system, blood and tears system, and dynasty system.The leveling system is different in this entry in that you actually get to choose the path and perks of your hero as they level. While this gets rid of a bit of the luck side of things when leveling it adds a strategy layer to picking your perks and leveling your hero. For those new to the series, in older games when your hero leveled you got to pick from a selection of randomly generated perks and skills. Sometimes you got the ones you wanted... sometimes you didnt. I can see how some loyal heroes fans would be upset about this major change but I personally enjoyed it. I felt like I had far more control over the outcome of my hero.The spell system in this entry has been overhauled as well. In previous games you would have schools of magic and spells that fell under those schools. You'd build mage guilds in your towns and get a random selection of spells from different schools of magic. Certain Factions were more likely to get specific magic types. In this game schools of magic are only available to certain factions. Spells and perks that you would get from a school of magic are part of the leveling system. When you level up you can pick a spell, a skill, or a perk. You no longer learn spells from mage guilds and shrines. I can understand how this draws away from classic heroes and can upset some devout fans but I believe the outcome is better. You can learn your spells on the fly (without having to go back to town everytime you buy a new level in the mage guild), Certain high level spells are restricted to level requirements (no level 5 guy smashing your team with death ripple), and you can pick between a weaker but wider range of spells or focus in a specific school and make those spells stronger. Again I believe it adds an extra layer of strategy and gets rid of some of the luck.the Blood and Tears System is an entirely new addition to the heroes franchise. The system rewards consistant gameplay style by giving you points towards your style. Blood being ruthless and tears being compasionate. You gain points for actions such as persuing and slaughtering lesser creatures (blood), or allowing them to flee (tears). When you get enough points your hero gains a special perk garnered to that gameplay style. It's an interesting feature and certainly brings something to the table. I found myself many a time slaughtering weak armies just for the blood points when i'd normally let them flee just to save combat time.The Dynasty system is a new addition as well. This particular addition came with some powerful perks at the cost of a miriad of major drawbacks. Perks include weapons with their own leveling system that can be passed from hero to hero and small perks that could give a starting advantage to new games. The DRM system forces you to be online in order to take advantage of the perks you can gain through dynasty. It can be relatively annoying if your playing games and you are disconnected. All in all I enjoyed the game and got my moneys worth out of it. While I understand that the vast majority of the negative reviews are for bugs or the DRM system the game itself is worth playing and is IMO the best HOMM available on steam. That being said HOMM 3 (and its expansions) is probably still my favorite entry in the series and is available on GOG.			"

I thought that would be the end of it.My account is banned for 10 minutes due to the number of times I attempted to log in. Except it isn't the 10 minutes you and I know.  It has now been 5 and a half hours. As far as I can tell 330 > 10.I give up.			"

												Many people say this game is the worst of the Series BUT that is just because its diffrent. This game is great with friends and awesome heroes options , and creating your own one. The Factions are missing Elves and dwarves but are adding the Sanctuary faction. This game was terrible at launch but went through alot of changes and is now AWESOME !!!! If anyone wants to play just tell me !! :)			"

												1) This game is by Ubisoft 2) It requires Uplay (third party gaming app) to play.     If you are still not convinced not to buy it...3) The launcher now crashes on startup (and is generally buggy), after I took a long time away from playing it.    Why did I stop playing it? Because...4) The game mechanic where you have to mindlessly click through turns just to get a big enough army to defeat the final castle in missions is still very much applicable. Click, click, click...5) Did I mention you can't access your saved games if you are offline, for whatever reason? You actually have to make offline saved games, which are separate from the normal saved games.I played through all campaigns of M&M 5, and all add-ons (a final battle in one of those was bugged, where you just kept fighting the battle over and over). So I've played a fair share. It's a pity about the problems with this one.6) Oh, and with reference to M&M 5. You remember those lovely cities with inspiring music, that were arguably the most enjoyable/well-done features in the game? Well, no longer. They've actually been downgraded.Despite all this, I would actually like to play the game some more. Sadly, point 3 rears it's ugly head.			"

												I dont recommend this game. ive played heroes of might and magic 3 and 4, but this game doesnt compare.its mostly because of the bugs in the game. you cant properly play multiplayer because you constantly lose connection eventhough it doesnt have anything to do with your actual internet connection. btw this only happens when i try to play with 2 or more of my friends so it ususally works if you play with just 1 friend and hot seat does work. ive also tried this game on lan with more that 3 people and that also wasnt playable.another problem of the game is that you need a connection with conflux (ubisoft) to play online and conflux usually has problems. ive read a lot of forum messages that conflux doesnt work and it seems like ubisoft is just ignoring all the bugs that are in the game and or connected to conflux. if conflux does work it usually takes 15 seconds to connect for some it takes even longer.if you want to buy this game to play this with friends i would recommend another game. it was the main reason for me to buy this games as i dont enjoy this type of games in single player modes.

												i am upset with the purchase of this game,  i really did not expect any risk with satisfaction as i have had such great success with steam games in over the past 4 years.  I would like a refund but i guess that is just the risk with buyinga game.  such a shame i waited so long to find out.			"

												Even though, in my opinion, it's not a worthy successor for M&M V, I still had a good time playing it.			"

												If you are having error like ""Unable to connect to conflux"" it a good idea to check your antivirus and  firewall setting chance are it blocking access. Hope it help. Cant wait for MMH VIII !!!			"

												One of the most boring games I've ever played.  With drudgery like this I should be getting paid to play this.  Pretty graphics do nothing to save this game from its dull, mindless point-click monotony that drags one along with little real mental or reflexive challenges.			"
