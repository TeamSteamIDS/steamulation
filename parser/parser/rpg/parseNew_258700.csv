												Okay, first of all, I know I got like 0 hours of this on Steam as I'm typing this, I'm literally still downloading this, but hear me out. Please.I've been playing this since it came out 4 years ago; Been on Korean, Chinese and South East Asian servers. I've played through all available classes and most 3rd jobs (Inquisitor, Raven, AbyssWalker, Obscuria, Saleana[Pyromancer?], Soul Eater, etc.) Got 2 characters on level 80, went back to SEA to look after my guild, went to EU to help my brother... Seen this also available on Steam last week and I just HAD to download this (again) to have it on Steam to be able to type out a review to warn people about what's to come. If it was 2012 I'd have given this a thumbs up, licked many ugly feet for it, but sadly this time has long passed.This game was A TON OF FUN.I loved this game.I skipped classes for it.It has the best and most fluid action combat ever.I was literally addicted.There is/was no other action MMORPG that feels/felt like it gameplay-wise. (But I think TianYu/Revelation Online has a similar feel from what I've seen, looking forward to it going OBT)BUT... 70 cap with the new classes, cash item events, constant reminders of the cash shop and these ""revamps that should have helped balance"" ruined it.!!! Note that what is currently happening in other servers doesn't have to happen in DNEU, community-wise, but it very well could !!!Why?1. Class DiscriminationThere's no room for ""low DPS"" and ""useless"" classes from what I've seen in other servers. Class discrimination is everywhere. Kiss your favorite class good-bye if it's discriminated. Class discrimination is one of the worst things to happen in DN, and it's not just the fault of the community, it's also the fault of how Nests and Raids at cap 70+ are made. In order to make it easier they gave classes buffs that weren't meant to have it and thus contributing to the class discrimination. Who needs suppport when you can KOS with a full ""useful DPSers"" party, right?You only see this kind of setup in almost any nest/raid party:- LightFury/Physician combo*- Ice stacker (Glaciana, Adept)- Main DPSers with ""useful KOS buffs"" (Assassins, assassins everywhere, or, occasionally, Artilleries and Acrobats, rarely mecha lolis)- If they feel like it, a Saint, but the LF/Physician* combo took that spot even if people argue that the Saint can't be replaced.""Wait, where's the tank?"" you may ask. Useless. Not needed. They revamped the Guardian, did it help? Nope.Guardian is you main? Good luck, buddy, good luck. Unless you can throw some €€€s (Or farm for ETERNITY) and get all rare grade bling bling and +12~+15 gear and max out FD%, go kiss your favorite character good-bye. I'm not even kidding.Kali? What is a Kali? Do we need that? Nope, not anymore thanks to Lancea and our lovely Raven/Ripper.The once awesome sorceress with the lazers and boom boom is now a boo boo alongside the poor Saleana/Pyromancer since the Majesty/Obscuria boost.Snipers and Tempests are already gathering dust.2. The stat that should have never existedFinal Damage. Remember when everyone told you to max out critical? Good-bye to that too, FD all the way, baby! How do you get it? 3rd stats on heraldries and accessories sets. How do you manage to get that? With luck. A LOT of luck. Those 3rd stat FD heraldry-babies sell for 300~900k gold at DNSEA... Have no idea how much they will sell for in DNEU but I'm PRETTY SURE it's not something you could afford by just farming 4 weeks without selling at least some AC items.*Remember Physicians? Guess why people like them again. No, really, try and guess! ...Tired already? Okay, okay.. 50% FD buff and a Speed buff with Injector EX! How does that sound? Neat! But wait, a healer AND someone to buff FD? Combined with a LightFury that heals and increases damage??? Go dig your graves, Saints. Inquisitors might still have a chance thanks to the boost.""Oh, you are gonna start the P2W bullcrap now, aren't you?"" Yeeeep. Well, not quite... Maybe... Ehh, yeah, okay, you got me.3. Give me your money!If you compare a character/class that doesn't have any AC items on to a character/class with a full rare (the blue) grade costume set with rare grade accessories, wings and tail, you will suddenly see a difference that you first think might not do much, but you're mistaken. A massive speed boost, rare grade costume set bonuses and the stats the costume gives itself  (Which, I may have to add, might cost you over € 100 to get a full set of, even more if you're just damn unlucky) PLUS the set bonus of the rare grade accessories that assure you a nice +1k~2k Attack Power even if you don't notice it at first. Believe me, I know, I wasted € +200 for that game already.Put these 2 characters in a PVP match; Comp not turned on, no armor. Just costumes. You don't even need to be smart to know who has the upper hand (regardless of who wins) Enchanting: Everyone knows that making weapons unbreakable thanks to the magic of cash items is a very bad thing to have in ANY MMO.Potions. NPC potions are useless, as soon as you hit level 10 you don't even think about them anymore. Cash potions, though? That's a nice 30% HP regen with a very little cooldown you got there! Yeah Yeah, I know I know, farming and cooking! But guess what? want more soil to plant on? Buy a ticket! Need your crops to grow faster? Buy some lovely drugs for your plants! Want to fish better and not waste 4 hours trying to get what you want? Buy a better fishing rod!Premium/Extra Heraldry/Talisman slots. Well why yes let's give the whale more options to pump some more stats into them! ""But you can only equip one Agi/Str/Int/Vit Heraldry/Talisman you stupid noob!"" Oh, I see... You're new to 3rd stats, right?Pet skills! Pet stats! Wooooooo~!4. Enemies, Nests and DifficultyAs mentioned before, at level 70 cap, things go from ""Well that's a bit hard"" to ""I'VE BEEN HITTING THIS GUY FOR AN HOUR AND HE'S NOT DEAD YET, HOW!?"".Nest bosses are ridiculously hard-hitting, have a ton of HP and basically level 70/80 Nests take hours unless you have your OP buffers and DPSers with full FD and +10~+15 gear around.Even normal dungeons are ridiculously hard on Master/Abyss mode at level 60+. When you just turned 60 and go to the new dungeons I wouldn't be surprised you die your first time because, wow, dungeons literally got a lot harder.This is one of the main reasons why this game went very downhill alongside point 1 and 3.It's a shame what this game has become. If it had better graphics it might have survived better, despite it's shortcoming and unfairness... But as soon as B&S and Black Dessert come to the west... DN is nothing special anymore.			"

												Introduction:First off, I love this game. It is great in so many aspects - yet I can just not recommend it. The thing is, while it was the love-child of someone once, it sure isn't anymore. And, to make matters worse, this ""someone"" was Korean, which puts oceans and continents between the version you will be playing and the version they are developing for. What is good about the game:The first thing you will find to draw you in will be, without question, the combat. It is fun, it is intuitive, and the learning curve is pleasant. The graphics, while dated, aren't bad for this kind of game. The colorful scenery and interesting level design where a big plus for me. That said, a lot of work went into many of the levels, usually making them feel unique but, at times, a little hard to navigate. The story, as unlikely as it sounds, is good. It's not just ""good"", it is, by all accounts, great. (For a MMO, that is.)The ""grind"" is not much of a grind the first time around. If you take your time, not rushing endgame (which you really shouldn't), then you're in for a great time and advance at a good pace. Getting to 80 was everything good in the game.What's so horribly bad that I wouldn't recommend it:Everything at the endgame is a cluster****. I mean it. You can advance almost entirely alone through the game (if you skip out on Nests you can get to lvl 80 without having talked to any other player) - but the moment you hit 80 you WILL need someone to do almost everything. ""Sure,"" you say, ""this is a massively multiplayer online game after all"", rolling your eyes at me. Well, you are somewhat right, but oh so wrong. You see, playing with others is implied in ""multiplayer"", yes, but to that end ""other people"" would be necessary. The game might not be dieing, but there are without question games with more players. Which would be probably every game with more than about 200 players. I am not even exaggerating: There is one mode, ""Hero's Battlefield"", that you can do at max level. At the end of the week you get a mail with how you ranked for that time period - and I constantly manage to get in the 11-100 bracket. While I am a natural, without question, I am reluctant to believe my crappy gear and inexperience would normally suffice to be this good at something I did for my first and second time. Conclusion: There simply are no players.That leads to the next problem: The players that usually are there, are hardcore, and, usually, a*****es. Sometimes I would even go as far as saying hardcore a*****es. The community consists almost entirely of people that played since they know how to turn on a PC. Which in many cases is only about a few years back. Yet, this game is all they know - you on the other hand, have no Idea of how difficult the endgame content is, of what to do and how to not instantly die because of your crappy gear and / or inexperience. That is, IF you actually manage to get into a group - after all, they want to clear that dungeon quickly and without incidents, so why would they take a under geared noob like meyou with them in the first place? The answer is there is no reason they would and so they won't, so you'll be left to farming gold, so you can buy gear to at least not look like an idiot. Also, the majority is not English native. Sometimes you may even encounter people who don't speak English at all. Now if we ignore the problems with the community and the impossibility of learning what to do in the endgame without help, there is still plenty wrong with this game.You see, the chat, for instance, is ubiquitous. It can't be turned off and it persists through cut-scenes, looking ugly and all. Why is that? Because there is no world chat. Instead, there are so called ""blue birds"" (twitter someone?) that allow you to send global messages. ""Global"" being literal: Everyone, everywhere will, without fail, receive that message. However, these birds come at a price. Namely, a real money, hard cash price. You can't get them normally, and a stack of them has to be bought with AC, the fancy ""I paid for this"" currency. Now you might wonder what I mean with ""a stack"": You don't buy one blue bird that allows you to use this chat option, because this is not a chat option. Every time you want to send such a message you have to consume 1 unit of blue birds. the best offer, 10 BBs, is a little under 5 bucks. So, OK, maybe that all is not enough to deter you. But maybe this will: Remember how I said ""this 'someone' was Korean, which puts oceans and continents between the version you will be playing and the version they are developing for""? There are several things important about this one. First, the cancerous translation. It is not just bad, it is the worst I have seen. Ever. Imagine Google translate for whole sentences, only slightly better. And they literally don't give a damn f***. They have been asked about it, but they won't even let players help that would work for free. There have been accounts of people who screenshotet mistakes and corrected them, only for eyedentity to completely ignore them. That, however, brings us to another topic. If you encounter one of the (various) bugs in the game, or, heaven forbid, spent money on an event and something goes wrong (spoiler: Something always goes wrong) your natural response will be to contact support. Thing is, there is no support for steam users. there is no ingame ticket system and the ticket system on the internet site needs you to log into you account - which doesn't work for steam users. But don't worry, you're not missing out on any stellar service here. If you actually care enough to make a normal account, describe you issue, maybe even have a screenshot or video, then you only have to wait 3 to 4 weeks for a response from their incompetent monkeys of a support team. This may sound rude, but these people, whose job it is being nice and helpful, are usually no help and as far from nice as any support I have ever seen. I'd even argue to say that they actually go out of their way to tell you to go screw yourself, regardless of you being a paying costumer.If that prospect doesn't scare you, be my guest and go ahead. This is just my personal experience and I would like to save you the pain of coming to like it and be disappointed at what becomes of it. That saying ""It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved""? It's wrong.EDIT: Starting February the WORST POSSIBLE THING, or WPT, happend, and the aforementioned monkeys managed to lose ALL the data. That mean, level, the entire inventory, all the titles, everything, save the names, is GONE. Yes, even cash items. The best they could do was host an enormous compensation event - which is mostly over by now. Don't get me wrong, the compensation was great for those who were there. Those who were not however will now log in to find themselfs naked and broke, while everyone else has more money than they could ever farm on their own. So if you are a returner, my condolences. If you are a starter, this hardly matters to you.TL;DR:Combat's awesome, classes are fun; people are unbelievable dib♥♥♥♥♥ that more often than not can not speak english; translations are horrendously bad; endgame content was awesome, but you'll probably never know because you can't find a group as a noob and you can't not be a noob without help from others; game is buggy, ""support"" is insulting and slow af.A lot of content has been removed in the 90s Cap to be reworked; there is hardly anything to do now.

												One of the better F2P MMORPGs that I've played. I did clock a lot more hours previously, possibly when it was in beta, and it's certainly one of the ones I've invested most time into among its counterparts plaguing the genre.The game itself works similarly to Vindictus with instanced dungeons & loot hoarding so there is grinding involved which I'm sure is an instant nope for a lot of people. With this in mind, most quests will consist of you carrying out certain objectives around the different dungeons and while the dungeons do have difficulty settings to choose from, most of the difficulty scaling will simply come from higher level dungeons. Aside from the dungeons there is also a PVP mode which has quite a few different modes available including a ladder.The 'dynamic' combat of the game is surprisingly satisfying compared to other games that feature this style of combat and each class does have a nice variety of skills to compliment that. Each main class can specialize into two different sub-classes which you can later specialize even further which provides some nice choice for those who make alts like there's no tomorrow.The game by no means compares in visual fidelity to Vindictus but does have a nice vibrant style which suits the game well aesthetically. The overall sound is pretty commendable too ranging from satisfying sound effects to a well made sountrack that's not too overpowering. There is also a lovely Christmas song that plays in towns for those lucky to play during the Christmas event. The voice acting isn't particularly great in most cases but the lines are kept short so it should bearable even for the less tolerant.Keeping in mind that the game does involve grinding I'd only be inclined to recommend to those who are fine with that. If that's the case then by all means I recommend you give the game a shot, it is free after all.A minor complaint for the Steam version specifically is that the ""Exit Dungeon"" key is F12 which is also Steam's screenshot key by default, while most keys can be rebinded I see no option for this one in particular so you might want to change the key on your own Steam beforehand.

												Grinding & Farming on Noobs      + Pay to Win ( this review might contain some bad manners + grammer)  (BEFORE U GO TO THOSE WHO THUMBED UP THIS GAME READ THIS )I've played this game with friends and solo. This game contains extream amount of Grinding, I mean from the first lvl to MAX, this game will make you do the same freaking DGN atleast 10 times or 100+ (i'm not even joking about 100+ i did several dgns more then 200)You will do back and forth quests, talk to this NPC talk to that, EVEN IF THEY STAND LIKE 10 METERRS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. When i talk about grinding, you will also grind like a maniac to get ""gold"" to buy gears to compete with Max leveld players who""pay to win""and offer to  ""Invite"" you on their nest runs.Hell..  players in this game will strongly recommend u get more alts to farm with such as, Daily quests & nests My favorit Go farm key runs, let me explain, ( A key run is where you boost a low leveled player/s probably lvl 16-24 for an item called Dimensional Key whitch you sell per stack(20) in Trade house. Now your wondering, how many times do i need to do this? depending on prices or time.. you might be doing this for atleast 1-2 weeks just boosting for ""gold"" People are defending this game saying it's not a PAY TO WIN game.First you can buy Costumes/pet/mounts/wings etc that give stats/movespeed w/e small♥♥♥♥♥♥it is. it's a diffrence.Example 2.5 % matk/Patk/hp/MP etc~~Second you can buy♥♥♥♥♥♥called ""jellies"" like other games these items ability is to make your item unbreakble when enchanting it from 6+ above so it wont break.~People often tell me. ""but you can buy all  that in the Trade house from other players"". well for all those who say this, you ignorant duck.  When person 1(pay to win) sells a costume for x amount of gold in the trade house to player B(grinder) who buys it. That GOLD is then used to buy whatever Person 1 wants. Person B who's a grinder for gold like the majorty will need to spend his money on ""Jellies"" Costumes"" pets whatever that can give you more stats..I have no problems with Free to play games. I play freaking dota and spend money in it cause i like it so much. but this ? If you don't spend atleast some 100 euros here and there your freaking dead stuck.This game is decent at start but suuuck monkey balls at max lvl only pay to win players or players who've been freaking farming like it was their job or messiah. I strongly adivse you to not play this game.  it's horrible in so many ways.Some♥♥♥♥♥♥that made my go insanetrade house  you can only sell 30 items per week if your not a paying costumerMail you can only send 30 mails per week and 5 per day that gets refreshed if u used all 30Nest/dgn THERE*S A FREAKING LIMIT per day on how many times you can do a nest! WHY? cause they want to controll the stock prices and limiting♥♥♥♥♥♥to players, then again WHY? so freaking players pay more to enchant their items (JELLIES)!you don't want it to break, cause you can't do nest(where u get materials to craft these set items) so if one breaks you have to pay more money to buy one or crafting materials.Graphics It aint 2014 blizzard cinematic gameplay, it's anime styled and rough edged. if you want better graphics go to aion or something. Gameplay it's okay but for some reason, you can't unbind f1-12  or make ctr+1/alt+1 as key strokes.As you accumulate more skills, it's hard as hell to not use all your keys, they do have this thing where u can switch your spells in battle from kinda quickMusic/:. well it's gonna make you go crazy after a while. i muted it. Story.. it's freaking hard to focus on the story when the people voice acting it out, are not even trying. Someone died i think or got hurt in one of the clips but hell.. i just laught at how bad they voiced this of so called work""This game is a 2/10			"

												Where to start...I started playing Dragon Nest years ago at the South East Asian server (DN SEA) right after it got to 40 cap. I remember having a level 32 epic set (Cerb set), spending hours on farming in order to get better gear to access parties for nests (end-game 4-man ""raid""). The next level cap was right around the corner when I finished (50-cap). All of I sudden I started making decent amounts of gold by buying/selling at the auction house - the economy was stable.Fast forward a few weeks.First guild-member to have full level 50 epic set, it was +8 and considered to be very good. Nesting and farming every friday and saturday. Tons of things to do!Fast forward to 2015.Been playing DN EU for a while, it was 60-cap when I arrived. It was decent, a good economy, lots of players and a good balance. 70-cap arrives along with more cash events. The game was still fun, but the events were a little too good sometimes. 80-cap arrives along with even more cash events, upgrade events targeting the cash shop. Every week there's more cash events. You all see where this is going?During december 2015 there's been 2-3 cash related events every day. Every week there's at least 4 cash related events. These events can double the points you charge for real cash. Events where charging $$$ currency gives x-amount of gold (usually insane amounts). These events are now the main source for in-game currency (gold). Some events gives more gold than 3 months of farming end-game content for lethal players. And it doesn't stop... The best gear in the game is very hard to obtain, and extremely expensive to upgrade. Events like +30% enhancement chance occurs every now and then. The gold used to upgrade is obtained by cash events. To upgrade equipement, one needs Magic Jellies (cash shop item) not to break the item.This game is pure P2W. Eyedentity is milking this server for every penny. I've never seen a ""F2P"" game so aggressively courage its players to spend real money on useless costumes and boxes (gambling) with events. Oh... forgot the montion there's a few players who apperantly are millionairs in real life. They control most of the gold in this game, making some of the best gear impossible to obtain for casual players. But hey - if you got a few thousan dollars to spend on this game, you'll be among the very best geared players.			"

												Ignore my short game time and focus on my point.They lost 2 years of player progression.If you didn't login during the 'reimbursement period' you're screwed, like me.You missed gold, items, costumes, mounts, level 80 gear.I went from 30 - 80.Because I missed the reimbursement period I had NOTHING at level 80.Even my class was changed to swordsmaster from marauder which is damn annoying.I sent a ticket asking for a refund for a costume I paid for prior to the 2 year wipe.Their reply? 'We can't reimburse you because you wasn't logged in during the reimbursement event'.Bare in mind, I paid EXTRA to make the costumes in question.. PERMANENT.I never asked for you guys to fail to backup the server during maintenances, I wasn't aware you screwed up to begin with.Goodbye Dragon Nest. You SERIOUSLY messed up.			"

												I've started playing this mmo a week ago or so. I have to say, it's a lot of fun, mainly because of the brilliant combat system. In most MMOs you queue an attack or spell, and your character will then perform the action whenever he/she feels ready (That's why I never liked playing melee classes, you just couldn't feel the right response).In DN however, your actions are a) direct and b) you have to aim manually. This makes combat incredibly dynamic! I've played my warrior to level 29 and also tested archer, templar and mage for a few hours and they all feel very good and responsive.The second big plus in this game is atmosphere / quests briefings etc. The quests texts are actually worth reading, rather short and quite often hilarious. Quite often I feel some resemblance to the early Zelda games for N64 in this respect (and the graphic is not too far off either).As for the negative points in this game: The PVE content only takes place in small instance areas, which are rather repititive after a while. And last but not least, there are tons of mistakes in both english and german translation.Still, in conclusion, I would absolutely recommend to try this game!PS. The Steam launcher doesn't seem to be working for me. I reckon this will be fixed soon. Alternatively, you could use the old non-steam launcher (visit the website).			"

												I've played this game for a bit now, soloed all the way up to lv.46 (including casual soloing of abyss-mode and stuff), and these are my findings and opinions of the game so far:pro's:- combat feels pretty nice, it has a few drawbacks but the style of attacks and such fits pretty well with the overall style of the game- When you killed enemies, they have a pretty decent chance to drop food items (+hp / +mp / +hp&mp / +attack / +evade / etc). This allows you to replenish your lost health and mana for free, but do note: it's not guaranteed: there are times when they just don't really drop food.- you can get pretty much everything (apart from certain costume items and such) by just playing the game. You can speed things up with cash purchases if you wish to.- it has a mentor - pupil system (or w/e it's called, haven't used it yet myself) so you can help out friends who started the game later, or get somebody to boost you up some levels.- The devs weren't 100% serious with the entire game. You have random stuff all over the place, ranging from a dance challenge from a minotaur to guards counting down the exact amount of seconds they still have to serve. As you can probably guess, this gives a good giggle now and then. (Or the casual 'Watch out for traps', before you get rammed in the face with a massive battering ram.)- party play is encouraged- playing with friends is also encouraged (you get more xp if a person on your friends list is in your party)- private dungeons: no killstealing from random strangers- you can farm / fish / cook and make your own food. These meals generally restore a pretty good amount of HP / MP, and they aren't crippled by a lengthy cooldown. Early food in quite often in the trading house, and it's not uncommon for it to be cheaper (a piece) than the normal potions. As soon as your normal potions begin to be useless in a heated fight, start getting these food items. Do note: they have a level limit (21-30, for example), so don't stock up on hundreds of them.- no forced combo system: you can use your skills in whatever order you see fit, and figure out for yourself which order works best to annihilate your opponents.cons: - technically the game is free, but there are a lot of limitations all over the place, some obvious, some less so. A few of those things; the trading house (auction house) has a limit of the things you can put up (30/week, 5 at the same time), and they only last 12h. A 'TH coupon' mostly relieves this, with unlimited /week, 10 at the same time and up to 24h offer duration. Another thing is the bag and bank system. You get some extra slots with the level-up reward boxes you get at some levels (24 and 32 if I recall correctly), but besides those you can only expand your inventory or bank with real cash.- Early on you won't really notice it, but at mid/ later levels you get crippled by a feature called 'blessing points'. You get a set amount for daily use, and a 'backup' bar which only resets every week. From what I've heard there are some places which require BP to even enter, but overall you can still play without BP. It's just that the XP gain and loot drops are severely crippled.In a nutshell: it's a grind crippeler. (not 100% sure, but the mentor in a mentor-pupil party doesn't need BP to run an instance, the pupil does). There are a few items which can restore some BPs, but those have a limited use / day (if I recall correctly you can only use 2 pots / day).- The jumping is garbage. Really. It's pretty much a fully vertical jump, with barely any horizontal movement. The animation is as if you first stop moving, and then jump upwards. After you land you start moving again.- There is no 'casual semi-rubbish mount' for direct purchase at lv40 or something. You can only farm for some rare drops in a dungeon, or buy the tickets / cards for a lot of gold in the trading house. Or you could skip all that and purchase one with cash.- The mounts are globally a bit useless. You can only use them in towns and the areas between the towns (not the actual mission areas). And you know what's the best part of all? In the towns you can warp around (even to specific NPC's) by talking to the guards. Way faster than a mount. So effectively mounts are more eye-candy than a truly required / practical thing to have.- The normal potions are generally really underwhelming for 2 reasons:1: they restore a relatively meager amount (you generally have way more hp / mp han they restore)2: the have a 20s cooldown.The cash store potions, however, are not the same. (From what I've seen) they have a fixed rate of +30% hp or mp, and only a CD of 3s or something. You get a few of these with the level-up reward boxes.- Character creation is rather bland. You can choose between a number of classes, then you can pick between a few hair styles / faces / eye colours / skin tones / clothing items. Oh, and you can give a custom name to your character, they are nice enough to allow for that.- The graphics aren't exactly fully optimized and realistic: it's a tad 'anime' in certain aspects, and it's not exactly refined in certain ways. The 'anime' style is not directly a con, but it might turn some people away.The list of cons does appear to be larger than the pro's, but I highly advise to just give Dragon nest a try (if you don't hate lolis and anime-goons with massive swords so much you'd toss your monitor through the window).Despite it's drawbacks and annoyances, it's still an amusing game to play (in my opinion, at least).Personally I love the Chaser-class Assassin (my main). He allows me to solo quite a lot. But I might be slightly biased since it's the only character I actually leveled, next to my lv6 archer.			"

												My first mmo and my first love. I never thought this cute game would make me play over 860 hours and still counting! But how that happened? I will sum up all pros and cons and explain them.*GAMEPLAY*- Is the best action combat in a mmo i've ever seen it can even be categorize into a hack 'n slash game all your skills/spells are skill shots, the game has a hard combo based PVP and there is the PVE where you team up with your friends and guildies to face huge and strong enemies but not combo based like PVP but it takes skill to dodge enemy attacks.*CLASSES*- LOLIS! Right now there are 8 beginning classes each can go into 4 different jobs. There is some class racism mostly for raids, but my main concern is towards Light Fury class due to his great healings and attack buffs despite him being a support class he is rly good in pvp to. Some classes work better with others but all have their place. Thankfully you can create up to 24 characters but you still have 12 characters slots avaible for free, so you can try out everything without having to delete your main characters.*GAME WORLD*- IT´S CUTENESS OVERLOADED! The art style is amazing it feels like an anime but also a manga with those gruesome effects from your skills and enemies, the characters feel so well made specially the playable ones, in the other hand there is the story, some like it but i found it confusing. Mainly for no voice acting in many lines and some early ones the voice acting was very poor but thank god the playable characters have supperb voice mainly because it´s korean.*DIFFICULTY*- Regarding the PVE the late game is hard and i mean it. You have to be very well geared and in top of that if you aren´t aware of how nests and bosses work you will die alot. I know if the game was easy it would be lame but when new raids (it´s a huge nest with many one hit kill shots to the players) only the elite players are able to do it. You will get used to the difficulty with time but the difficulty leap is huge, actually until you get lvl 40 the whole game felt like a tutorial. To resume it´s hard and tasty.*CASH SHOP*- The gold and cash money are kinda bound because there is alot of cash stuff you can get with gold. But, is it pay to win? Yes and no, paying makes your life easier because people exchange cash money for gold, but it doesn't matter how much gold you have because its all about RNG ( random number generator ) you can get rich by just doing easy stuff and get lucky to drop something worth alot of gold or spend tons of gold to get geared in order to do the hardest raids to be able to get profit it's all about the RNG. And there is the deluxe box the game main source of income, it drops random stuff good or mostly bad *cough* RNG, but hey i got a pegasus and other good stuff without spending much money.*COMMUNITY*- Yes i had to talk about it because it´s one of the best on the internet firstly because how friendly they are and by the ammount of the events they do.If you seek a great online game where you want to customize your characters and play a very fun game with new content every month, Dragon nest is the game for you.8/10			"

												This game was great. The combat was fluent unlike any other anime mmorpg I have played.Last played it back in 2015....

Which for some reason requires your National ID Number?!

This game is constantly in evolution, and some content was added like once a week/two week.The begining can be rude, especially  the level 24-32, but if you go through you will live awesome things like fight with dragons, tactics raid...Try this game and play with some friends!

												Classes available at the beginning of the game, for example, are only five more a sixth arriving in the coming months. Of these classes, although they may customize some aspects with the progress in the game, we will not drastically change the appearance. We may decide facial expression, hair color and character (choosing from four or five alternatives for option) but we can not change such as their gender or their tonnage. A handicap rather obvious for a genre in which customization is so important.			"

												Spoiler alert.* Great anime style graphics.* Legit fast paced arcade slashing gameplay.* Variety of approaches to monsters killing.* Ability to play this game in coop with a friend or in SP-ish style.This game is one of those where the more you play the more you want to play! Currently I have around 6 hours in this game, one very kawaii archer character and lots and lots of fun received from this game! Gameplay is very easy to understand and indeed fast-paced. Unlike one of my favorite MMO Guild Wars 2 - Dragon Nest is fully based on your reflexes. It's like u're playing some kind slasher with MMO components. You dodge, you run around shooting monsters.The way this game uses MMO components is perfect. When you get to town - lots and lots of people around, guild managment/creation, events, party creation/joining and so on. It's all there. However when you go outside of town - instance created specifically for you and your party. Meaning it's possible to treat this game as a slasher coop where your character is constantly evolving.There are plenty of dungeons and quests in this world. Unfortunatley on my first character I don't follow story all that much, but based on some cutscenes - it has something to do with rescuing someone. Along the main storyline u're free to help bunch of other NPC and even befriend them. Each dungeon has its own personality and style. And in the end of each dungeon there is a boss waiting for ya...Oh my god boss battles! Is't been a while since I was excited about that! Yeah, it may sound like a simple thing, but when you have amazing fast paced arcade fighting gameplay - this simple fight can turn out to be very exciting! Especially on maximum difficulty! It provides you with challenge which can be beaten without paying extra billion dollars.			"

												Well I would like to be able to write a review for a game I was looking forward to trying out, however unfortunately I didn't even get the chance to play the game. Ignore the 8 hours Steam claims I have played for, thetruth is that is the amount of time it has taken me to try and get around the games insistance that I have a cherry account, not that I am adverse to setting up an account but it would be nice if the process actually worked instead I am asked to create a password with a mixture or upper case, lower case . numbers and a special character, a little extreme but never the less I did what I was told next I was taken to another screen asking for a security question and a 6 digit pin .. now this is where it gets interesting - every time I tried to input a 6 digit code it would give me an annoying red pop up telling me to enter a code after clicking on the first digit - then rinse and repeat.

												hy you, whoever you are.i personally really reccomed this game if you don't want the classing click and cast RPG's. as you can see i have quite a lot of hours on this game considering that it's still increasing and my max hours exept for Dragon Nest is 55 hours xDi'll be talking about the pro's and con's of the gamePRO'S:- first and most importantly, the combat is amazing. it feels smooth and worked out, PvE's combat system makes it that you improve gradiually while PvP is fast paced and really fleshed out.- the skill tree. you have a total of six classes al with a first and second specialization wich allows you to choose your playing style so you get the most enjoyment out of it.- diversity of dungeons. trust me you hav A LOT. you have 4 cities you can stay in:        ____ Prairie town; for lvl 0 - 10       ____ Calderock village: for lvl 10 - 25       ____ Saint haven: for lvl 25 - max.           Saint Haven is the main city and you will be returning to it every time       ____Lotus march: for lvl 40  - max- the diversity in quests. Yes i do admit there are a lot of side quests that repeat and the sheer amount of side quests can be intimidating too. - The story. there's a really good story and the biggest pluss on the story is the fact that every class sees a different side of that story. there are parts that something one class does affects what other classes see, in the story ofc not in dungeons themselves.- The nests. Nests are special dungeons that you can complete a certain amount of times per week, these are the perfect difficulty for their levels. not too hard but not easy either, they expect you to learn the boss mechanics or otherwise you will die... a lot and get frustrated xD. But when you're finally able to clear it solo without dying, that is the best feeling ever and you get awesome loot. you get rings, necklaces, earrings but materials to craft gear too wich all boost your overall stats- gearing has been made tons more easy and fun to do, you are averagely to good geared with cauda gear wich has the lowest stats out of all max lvl gear but is easier to get and can get you started fairly easely- getting gold has been made easier too with the lvl 90 dragon jades selling for around 600 - 800 goldCON'S- the graphics are a bit outdated, they fit the game but might be a reason not to play it for some of you- once you reach max lvl (lvl 90 rn) the game slows down a bit because you need to get gold to get better gear namely heraldry's, Dragon Jades and Talisman which all boost your stats. Yes you do get these through dungeons while leveling but they're either magic grade or rare grade. Your goal is to get all in epic grade. exept for talisman they're only magic grade or rare grade and rare grade is as the name suggests rare to get and is really expensive in Trading house (the black market in Dragon Nest)- the community sometimes: most max lvl players have multiple characters that are all max lvl and have the best gear you can get. these people are mostly just annoying people boasting how good they are and how noob you are compared to them. and hey admit it you are noob compared to them but that's normal, you just started the game and ar improving steadely. so let them boast they have nothing better to do anyways.- the hosts of DNEU are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, they take forever to fix a problem to then have it appear again a few days later, the free events arent worth your time heck even the paid events like tier systems are not worth your moneyif you can't find a guild then join Ketumei-Kishidan, i'm in it ^^ my ign is or BitingTiger or DarkBiteso yeah i hope this helped and enjoy the game if you do end up checking it out			"

												So me and my friend were looking for some good Anime style rpg games when my friend stumbled upon this gem. It has everything a person wants in an Mmorpg. Good skill trees, plenty of awesome quests, a variety of character roles. The community does need a bit of a push in the friendlier direction as most towns are speechless apart from the odd ""FREE BOOST 16-24 PM ME"" being shouted by some random mad man in armor whom is sitting on a giant wolf in the middle of the street. All in all I havent played as much as some people but from what I have played I have enjoyed the story, the quests, the diversity, EVERYTHING! There is one bad word that I have to say and that is, The running back and forth from dungeon to quest provider. Its like putting in stops every five meters on a rolercoaster. Not only does it stop the action but it also leaves your face a bloody mess. But aside from that 10/10, love it, Im gonna play more.			"

												I used to like this game because it had nice action style combat - always in challenging dungeons, rather than kill 10 rat quests.The fact that I could put the game on a very hard difficulty and spend ages clearing each dungeon with a friend made up for the fact that running about town picking a million quests I don't care about is time consuming and un-fun.Now they decided to remove the option to set a difficulty higher than normal (basically making it impossible for me to lose solo, let alone when playing with friends).Difficulties are available at some point, but I don't play games to suffer the boring ride until the fun begins so I cannot recommand this.It *is* free however, and if you're more of a casual you might enjoy it, so still do go ahead and give it a try.

												From what I can see so far, this is a very fun, enjoyable and surprisingly immersive game. It has a refreshingly new combat ""style"" compared to the press-a-button-and-wait combat of the average MMORPG.Good points:1. 6 classes all with varied stats and abilities, and at level 15 you can choose a specific path to go down, normally DPS and tanky.2. Brilliant combat! I cannot say how gratified I was when I discovered that you actually have to try when it comes to killing various things. Most games you just tab a nearby enemy, button mash for a while, and soon enough a dismembered creature will fall to you. With this game, you have to aim at said creature. Dodging attacks is a fun element, rolling away from an enemy's attack. And bosses do significant damage with a chance of killing you if you let your guard down. All mobs have their own special attacks too, which makes combat interesting.3. PvP is very fun, with 2 teams of 3 players lobbing fireballs at slicing away at each other. Strategy is a much beneficial aspect in this game, if you charge in staright away, you will be taken out in three seconds flat. Placing traps around the arena is advised to slow and damage enemies. 4. BALANCED CASH SHOP!!!!! The first game I have literally ever played where you don't need to spend a million quid to keep on-par with other players. The only thing you should possibly buy to help with the game at a later point is extra inventory space.5. Noticable strength increase. In most games, you need to have full sets of items and have them upgraded to the max to see any slight noticable increase in damage dealt and recieved. In Dragon Nest, upgrading one item a few times will help a lot, and make a nicely noticable difference. Sets are a great thing to have on this game however as you get useful set bonuses as a ""reward"" of having several items of the same tier. 6. The sounds in this game are surprisingly good, and so are the animations for your characters skills. These help make the game immersive and keep you playing for longer.Not so good points1. Gender-locked classes is a small but rather irritating thing in this game. Want a female warrior? Sorry. A male Kali? Not for you. Hopefully this will be changed in a future update.2. A little character GUI would be nice in the inventory space so you can see what your character looks like as you change equipment. However, this is probably just me being fussy.Verdict - A great F2P game that you should definately download if you are a long-time fan of MMORPGs or are new to the genre. Massive tick from me :)			"

												Since they handed the game to this ""Cherry what ever"", the game has gone down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, all character went from ""level 50 something something"" to level 80 and with the wrong classes, because they said, they lost information on the Database while making the changes, they tried to ""compensate"", i don't want my characters level 80 FOR ME, i want the adventure and troubles of making them get to 80, not to talk about all the itens from Halloween and Xmas events i lost, And aparently there is nobody you can cry to fix things, i sent a ticket to the support one month ago, now it says i haven't even sent one ever, *Slow clap*. I was in love with this game since i started playing it, gameplay/art style/story even the crappy voice acting. But Cherry what ever its called, Killed this game for me, sucked the joy of playing it right out my veins.Right now i'm a Love/Hate relation with this game. I'm still giving a thumbs up just because of the memories of the good times i had.			"

												The game was released long time ago and I first tried it back in 2013 for a couple of hours, the combat system is still very good compared to some other recent f2p mmorpg. I wanted to give it another try, but unfortunately the game doesn't work at all for me and for a lot of people who have been trying to have fun playing this game. I spent hours downloading it with my slow internet to realise that reCAPTCHA verification is required to signup and it isn't working at all. I managed to open the Patch without using Steam, thanks to the help of the community, and I created my account in their website. Spent some more hours downloading the last patch and when I tried to launch the game, it just doesn't work, the process just crashed 2/3 seconds after (no crash report at all), there isn't any info about how to fix this problem and the community is complaining about the lack of customer support from the publisher.If you're trying to play Dragon Nest, I recommend you to not waste your time with Steam, download the game directly from their website and have fun.In a scale from 0 to 5, I rate Steam Dragon Nest Europe with 0 since it doens't work at all and there's no customer support either.

												So I just randomly picked this up while bored not long ago, thinking I might get an hour or so entertainment out of it... seeing as I rarely manage to stay on an MMO for long before losing interest. Buuuuut Dragon Nest has really hit home with me, and have found it incredibly fun to play so far!As the game description says, it uses a more action-orientated combat system that makes it a heck of a lot more different from the usual ability-stacking and micromanaging you get with most MMOs, and makes combat incredibly fun and hardly like a grind at all. I've found myself picking up low-level quests on purpose, just to get them out of the way... whereas usually my quest hubs are littered with forgotten quests that I could never find the drive to clear away. It doesn't take much effort at all to look like a complete badass once you start smashing up enemies! (Note: At this point, I've only experienced the game through a cleric, after just reaching double figures in level)Graphically, the game does take some time to get used to... if you're not used to the cartoony/anime graphics of some other MMOs. And even though the graphics are hardly groundbreaking, they're not an eyesore either... it can just feel incredibly odd at first with how chibi-fied characters are, while keeping mature voices. Ah... and that's one thing that's good to mention beforehand. The voice acting is very lacking in most cases! ...But even then, I'd hardly say it's that much of a game-ruiner. Considering most dialogue is quite short.So, all in all... I was very happy to have picked up this little gem. And although it has it's flaws such as it's voice acting very minimal character creator... personally, I find the good to outweigh the bad. Combat is brilliant, the world is really quite appealing once you get into it, a fairly decent story, and it has an absolutely amazing sense of humour at times. So if you're looking for an MMO that goes away from the standard formula of WoW or similar games, at least give it a try... it's not even a big filesize! ...Just for gods sake, be careful around the blacksmiths. >_>			"

												So before I say anything else -- I see so many people having trouble with this game, please allow me to share some simple solutions!> 1.) The Cherry Account asks for too much information.Just fill in whatever. They don't check your information, I literally got through saying that I am a non existent person living in the state of I made this up.> 2.) It won't let me enter my pin.It didn't let me either -- not through the game launcher, at least. I went to the website, logged in there, and succesfully created a pin within seconds. Worked smoothly in-game after that.> 3.) Steam launcher won't work.It does that sometimes. You can either a) restart the launcher until it DOES work, or b) go to C:\program files(x86)\steam\steamapps\common\DragonNestEurope and find the folder that says DragonNest. From there, start the launcher manually. (To make this easier to access, you can just drag the folder to your desktop, too.).. And that should solve all the problems! These solutions will take a few minutes at most, and you get a great game in return for it.And now, the actual review! (NOTE that I have done the map dragging thing, too, hence Steam stopped counting my hours in the game. I have maaaany more hours in this than the 28,4 recorded!)The Pros Combat is fun! It's no simple ""click on the enemy and they will die"". You actually have to DO things in this game, haha. Once you're familiar with all the attacks you have, a level up happens and a new ability or skill becomes available. Keeps it nice and fresh! Dungeons are (almost) all different! There's a bunch of different environments and while one or two may occasionally be alike, no two of them really look the same. Keeps you exploring, too! The story changes with each class you play as. Play the game as a warrior, your story is different next time you replay it as an assassin. Again, keeps it nice and fresh. PvP apparently is lots of fun! I haven't tried it myself yet, but I've seen videos, heard stories.. all very nice and positive. It seems very promising! The community is REALLY friendly, for as far as I can tell. People are helpful, kind, and willing to help you level. Bonus points! Leveling goes at a nice and balanced pace. Not so quickly that it makes the whole level system seem irrelevant, but fast enough to make you feel like you're really progressing. You'll feel productive after a few hours of dungeoning, rather than tired after a few days of grinding (which is the case in many other MMORPGs). I am a cleric. I can dance. I feel like a one man boyband. ..I am a dancing boyband cleric. Truthfully, that's all I ever needed in life.The Cons Limited character customisation. Classes are gender locked, and you can only choose from a few hairstyles, colors, facial features and outfit colors.  The start may feel a little lonely. Probably because everyone's been having so many trouble registering, the starting areas (for me at least!) were very quiet. It wasn't until I reached the third town that I saw another player for the first time. Once you get there, though, there's a nice amount of other players! Some things are outdated. A friend of mine and me have been looking for something called ""the Apocalypse Nest"" for FOREVER.. only to later hear from another player that it has long been removed from the game. The dungeons are.. or have gotten.. way too easy. Like waaay too easy. Apparently, things get really difficult from level 80 and on (and SUPER difficult near the level cap?), but I'm currently level 57 and have yet to get my HP below 75% for the first time. In fact, I'm now dungeoning without armor in hopes of creating somewhat of a challenge, haha. The graphics aren't all that great. They're still okay, though! ..cash items are expensive.. eehhh-- THE VOICE ACTING NOWould I recommend this game?Aha, well, yes! Once you're past the whole starting process, the game really is great fun. Pros weighed against cons, I'd say the game is easily enjoyable enough to make up for its weaknesses. The only thing I really do hope they update is the difficulty level.. Who knows, though. Maybe once I'm level 80, I'll wish I could return to the times things were still this easy. Haha. Welp, one way to find out..			"

Yeah, it requires some silly registretion involving either your phone no. or some document. I did it. But... The captcha doesn't let me in.These guys just loose a ton of money because they just fail to kick one of their employees to make them stop drinking their coffee and just do something already.This is crazy.

												This game has some of the most beautiful effect and animations in games. People who like those overexaggerated anime characters like chuunibyou or bleach are going to love this game. It can get a bit grind-y from level 30 onwards though. Here are some pros and cons which comes to my mind when playing this game:+ class diversity: 6 classes (warrior, archer, tinkerer, priest, kali, mage) with 2 subclasses each which again are divided into two more subclasses. So there are 24 classes in total+ Arpg: a lot of action is going on and on higher level difficutlies you have to fight through a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of monsters. Bosses are also very challenging+ fun PvP and 8-player raids: PvP is about evading skill shots and outsmart the enemy. It feels like a 3D Tekken game. Raids seems to be fun, too. You can start doing raids at the start of level 30+ cute anime characters: Irine is my favorite and also the Kali, dat a** :3+ easy to pickup: Although the game itself can become a bit grindy, you can always stop when you want. A dungeon lasts for 5-10 minutes. If you have a break and want to play some DN, just do 3-4 dungeons and go back to work/studying+ no hard p2w: you can pay for XP boosts I think, but that´s about it. You can do anything by investing a bit more time into- bag space is really small, if you don´t want to invest money into the game. But it gets better, because you get 10-slot-bag expansions (for free) at Level 12 and 24. I assume you get expansion for every 12 levels. The same applies to the bank slots too. I can live with this though, but from 1-12 it´s really annoying to sell all those crap to get some free space back.- annoying profession: you can learn fishing and farming to gather materials for the cooking job. Well, it´s not fun and it seems like you need to make food to get ""free potions"" for dungeons at level 30+ onwards.TL:DR: All in all I really fell in love with this game. I tested almost all Arpgs on Steam like Neverwinter and C9, but this game really is awesome.			"

												Well It s really interesting game. Even though it has classic story it has nice options. You can fight on your own on different difficulties. If someone watched SAO (Sword art online) then I can say that this is one of the most simmilar games to it. But on the other hand you can be really quickly confused by events and such. You dont have to wait for respawning monsters or anything cause every single player can be in ""his own"" dungeon and fight.Every class has a bit different story but with same events. You can craft few things like an armor or weapons (well you dont need almost anything else :D ). Well dont know what to say next :) Just try it and dont worry its pretty easy to understand.			"

												This game is pretty damn good, if I do say so myself. It does have elements of originallity while keep in style with the classic MMORPG.Gameplay:This is the unique part, I don't know if it's my lack of scowering the internet and downloading shady Anime MMORPGs but, I will say the play style is amazing. The roam, the combat, it all  completely immerses you in the game. The quests aren't too repetitive, however you do find yourself going to the same dungeon at least once or twice, but that isn't much of a problem since each dungeon is enjoyable to complete with the intense, fast action combat. Controls:The idea of having a mouse sensitivity option avaliable at the press of two keys is extremely helpful, due to all the combat being manual, some may have a hard time aiming, however it is easy to get used to. The controls are neatly laid out and easily customizable for those with different preferred layout. As for the controller support, I manage to try it out for a short period of time and personally I can only say the keyboard controls were easier for me to use, if you're more comfortable with a controller and start out with a controller, then it would probably be easier.Character Customization:Despite how amazing this game is overall, I'd have to say, the customization is lacking, A LOT. And I mean, A LOT. That is one thing they could improve one with more hairstyles and colours avaliable, because I generally see a lot of clones walking around low-leveled areas. I myself think it would add to the immersive gameplay to have more options, as people would be able to customize characters where you don't see same-faces walking around, making you as a character feel unique compared to everyone else.Connection:It's great they decided to spread Dragon Nest to Europe, I can't image how much that helped people in Europe with not-so stable internet connection. While I experience no issue with connection, other than tiny almost unnoticable lag spikes in crowded areas (my game pretty much runs as smooth as silk), my friend (this might be due to their bad computer and internet connection) has issues, more often than not, during loading times their game tends to freezes, and every now and then the game will suddenly crash, which is troublesome if in a dungeon that is close to being completed. It would be nice to get more servers in, especially if they were to cater to different parts of Europe (e.g. North West, South East etc.) And that may help connection issues even further.Play Time:I will say, the play time is immense. But what do you expect from an MMORPG, 4-10 hours gameplay? You're kidding right? So far I've played 52 hours, and I have a level 25 (soon 26) Warrior, a level 16 (going on 17) Cleric, a level 6 Academic and a Level 10 Cleric, along with a few level 1s I've been neglecting. In the early stages of the game, level is pretty quick if you dungeon almost non-stop (like myself) and you find you can get to level 15+ in the space of 2-4 hours. However once you reach the level 17+ mark, leveling and experience gain drops dramatically. Some (myself not includded) would think of this as tedious, the sudden difficulty in level could prove frustrating, however despite it's suddeness, to me, it ensures we don't get Maxed out Level 60s right off the bat who actually have no idea how half of the mechanics work in the game. It creates a balance, slowing down those deemed as ""inexperienced"" and allowing them to go at a slower pace, learning each and every mechanic along the way. So when they do get to Level 60, they aren't completely lost on how to do anything.TL;DRThis game is incredibly fun if you excuse the lack of customization or it doesn't really matter to you. The controls are crisp and easy to grasp and change if necessary, however for long-time keyboard gamers, the controller support is not recommended. And you find you can easily get attatched to the game, with many hours of play time. However, I wouldn't recommend this a game (unless you really want to play it) if you have poor internet or a computer that is rather slow due to the overal size of the game being huge.			"

												Okay here is my first Review ever:I partly agree with the negative reviews but also partly with the positve ones.It's a great game at it's core, BUT as a beginner you will struggle with class selection because you don't know what is popular in parties and which class specailization is good for PvE and PvP. There is alot you would have to figure out before even start playing. And yeah you can solo alot of dungeons for leveling, but after a while you will end up grinding (even with questing you will have to run through the same dungeon multiple times) and that stuff can get really really boring. Until level 24 you may or may not find some ppl who will boost you for free or for items. but after that nearly no one is gonna boost you for free or even gonna grind with you.This Game is really fun when playing with friends or within a Guild, so I would recommend every beginner to look for a Guild with nice people as soon as possible alot of them would help you for free in leveling and give you tips for your class!tl;dr:++Good++*nice and skillfull action combat system*alot of freedom regarding building your skilltree *mostly friendly people*great story*able to buy some cash items with ingame money at the trading house*lolis*every year something new*nice world--Bad--*Class discrimination*hard to compete in PvP and some PvE dungeons without cash items or very expensive stuff*equipment is mostly luck based (or money based)*cash shop items are very expensive*can get boring to grind for months to reach max level*as a beginner its hard to figure out what class is needed the most for parties/raids*(not the best graphics and some bugs here and there)*lagg can mess you up alot especially in PvPI would recommend this game if you want to play it with friends. If you want to play it solo you have to prepare for alot of grinding/farming. You need to be patient in this game.			"

												Great game. I'd love to actually play it again someday.When this was under administration of the previous company, I had no problems with is. Perhaps a bit grindy, perhaps a bit empty. But the gameplay is solid, the storyline is good, and the voice acting is decent. This has some seriously great writing!However, the recent overtake by Cherry Entertainment is just shy of a destruction of the property. Any and all accounts that used to exist on the old servers now have to be transferred to a new Cherry account. Okay. Lets make one, shall we.E-mail and Password.Okay.Date of Birth, Security question and a pin.err... okay.Enter pin again.Okay.Full name, gender, country,Okay.Identity type.What? I'm not ready for philosophical questions here, Cherry. Oh, you want me to publish to you either my Social security number, my drivers licence or my BIRTH CERTIFICATE ID!WHAT!This is utterly and absolutely unacceptable!How did this takeover go through? Was there anything of an acceptance test here?My player data is being held hostage by a company that requires me to give them my social security number to give it back. This is nothing less than theft of virtual property. I've known many people who've spent a lot of money on this game. Where has that gone? The rights to the credit that money gives within the game? Gone! They cannot access it without giving critical identity date.I won't stand for this, and neither will my friends. Goodbye Cherry. Go choke on this IP.			"

												I'll just keep this short: game itself is fine but the publisher is a joke, they did not have a backup server and when it crashed it lost the data of all the characters in the entire server making everyone lose absolutely everything. So basically stay away from this version unless Shanda loses the publishing rights and someone competent picks it up (I'm actually expecting the server to tank in the next 2 months).Don't have any recent playtime since I switched from the steam client to the regular one due to crashing issues by the way, just wanted to warn people about this.

												First personal information required, and now my characters are gone? GG ty very muchEDIT: Sent a ticket to get my characters back which took a while, but there is literally no point in asking your account back since they just level all your old characters to level 80 (which is great i guess) but the downside is that you don't have any items and gear. I still got a small amount of gold (idk how) so I thought np ill just buy some gear, but when i went to the trading house there was almost nothing that was cheap and level 1-80 (when before the transfer there were many low level and cheap items and now there is almost nothing), so the game is basically dying (kinda expected that since the server status is always on sparse).TL;DR: If you are new stay away since the game is dying and you need to fill in personal information and if you're a returning player don't bother asking your characters back since they just give you a level 80 char without anything on it.

I came back and was happy that nothing changed over all. Still a fun game, and even as a f2p you can reach high levels and have good equipment. So yeah, give it a shot.UPDnevermind, Cherry Exchange doesn´t even work properly. They are not able to send a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ e-mail with a link, so one can verify his account.

												Hi all, Dragon Nest, its a very interesting MMORPG of all i played( i play a lot of games this type) In all MMORPG i was max lvl 40-45, but in Dragon Nest Europe, im already 63, and all time i was interested of this game.Now im talk about main story.Main story is different in different towns while in first town we meet Descedant of ancient in second town we need to get orb and only then we starting to know who is she.This game is special because at lvl 15 we choose our specialization(I see this rare in other MMORPGS)And 1 another thing we upgrade our specialization and lvl 45(Not somuch spells just upgrades to them.In this game is a lot of classes, i talk about rarety classes, i dont seen them at MMORPG.So,we start.Kaliits  Intelligence and Strenght class, she need a lot of mana for her spells, at lvl 15 she can go at screamer or dancer.At lvl 45, Screamer can go at Dark Summoner or Soul Reaper, Dancer can go Blade Dancer or Spirit Dancer,Oh i forgot screamer its a magic damage and a dancer its a physical damage.And on that word i finish my prewiew abotu Dragon Nest.I recommend this game if you like MMORPG, Be highest lvl at all MMORPG, Good luck :))              Thanks to War Child with helping			"

If you decide to login with an existing account, the LOGIN button does not work, or any other on the interface, so you have to close and choose the option Sign in. The problem is you cant ever finish the Sign up because they make you create a stupid PIN code that resets the Sign Up process every time you try to click on the number pad they make you use, so its a never ending cycle.

												Though the graphics do look appealing (anime alike), the game itself is very shallow. It's nothing like a real MMORPG which it claims to be, but it's more a HUB game. In towns you CAN meet other people (and those felt already very empty), pick up your quests and the moment you exit the town you're in a private (party) instance. And if you think that instance is the whole dungeon, you're wrong. From that instance on you go from one small map to the next (and when I say small it really is SMALL - 2 to 5 minutes max to get through including killing the monsters!) until you get to the end boss of the dungeon and then the 'fun' is over.An other thing that bugged the hell out of me is the instant-gratification that this game uses. It's clearly aimed at little kids who want to hear how well they're doing for every little silly thing that they've done. REALLY? Insta-gratification is prolly one of the worse things you can come across in games and certainly doesn't give the feeling of accomplishment, even when you actually did achieve something in the game! >:(Last but not least, the Ca$h $hop... Every time you hit town you get that so extremely annoying pop up that they're selling stuff in it. And when I look at it, it's not just cosmetics they're selling. All cosmetic items have stats, which points somewhat Pay2Win, while the gamble boxes (one of the Ca$h $hop I really hate) give a chance for something really overpowered. How do you mean Pay2Win and milking whales?			"

												After Shanda transfered the game over to Cherry Credits, we basically lost everything we owned. We did get some items reimbursed, but it was nowhere near what we had before. We lost our gear, our cash shop items, event items and PvP ranks etc.They then only gave us a few cash shop items back, I think I got 50% or so of what I had originally. The game already had problems before, with lag in PvP that gave anyone with a bad connection a clear advantage, to people teleporting everywhere and lagging so much that you couldn't see their skill animations. It also runs terrible on a high end PC, with constant frame drops and stuttering.Just avoid this game altogether			"

												I have been playing Dragon Nest Sea (Not EU) for about a year and i have to say Dragon Nest it self is very addictive, the combat style is very good. No click and wait but i have to say there is a lot of pro's and con's about this version (EU,SEA,NX) first of all, EU's update is way behind Dn SEA and X, EU has jost got it's lv60 cap in december and SEA has almost got it's lv70 cap also if you have a bad pc (like me) its very dificult to move around towns as there is only 1-3 servers unlike NX and SEA they have multip[le servers to go on so you dont lag for each towns but gameplay in dungeon is very smooth.

												7/10Cons:The game itself is a fun game to waste hours on but the one thing that sets the game back is how there's quite a few game breaking bugs. For example your character can't complete or even start the main quest which sucks if you've put quite a lot of hours getting your character leveled up, this isn't really an issue if you're level 15 or lower as it doesn't take much time to get back to those levels but once you reach a higher level such as 30 or above and sunk around 10 hours into the game, it's a real chore to get back the progress you've lost.The quest markers may often direct you to an entirely different area then where you need to go (this becomes more frequent once you reach Saint Haven) so you spend 10 minutes running around looking stupid wondering why the Dark Mines aren't in the area you're at or even you cleared a dungeon out for no reason only to figure out that where you were wasn't the correct area.But there's only one thing worse than the bugs mentioned and it's the God Awful voice acting in the game, most of the NPCs you talk to sound like they woke up from a 3 hour sleep and are still half asleep, but since the game is free you shouldn't really expect amazing-ness as far as voice acting goes.There is a lack of a main menu which if you just boot up the game for the first time you'll have to suffer through loud music until you finish creating your character (same goes with other options, just using sound as an example)If you're playing this game during the Christmas event then the jingle bells instrumental loop will drive you insane so it'll make you want to pick up the quest as fast as possible and bolt out of there.Pros:The game provides quite a lot of characters to choose from so you can always replay the game as a different character to find out which best fits out your playstyle. The characters also have different paths they can take ability wise so you can pick a different path to make your playstyle more combat or team player focused. The characters are all unique in their own way, classes like the Cleric are more suited for team play and classes like the warrior are more suited for combat which makes it easy for a party to figure out a tactic before heading into a dungeon.With 80 levels to achieve you'll really sink in a lot of hours playing this game, getting to that final level after putting hours into the game will give you a sense of accomplishment when you do so in the end. The combat system is surprisingly fluid for a free to play game, it's a real time RPG where you have to constantly be on your feet to no get wombo combo'd into the next dimension and allows new players to easily get a feel for the combo mechanics of the game so that they can almost effortlessly take care of anything that stands in your way. The controls are simple yet effective when it comes to the battlefield.Not feeling PvE? Well there's always PVP (I'm not very good at this). You can pit up against a friend or a stranger in the coliseum to finally prove who is the ultimate warrior. The PVP offers a unique system which balances out the gear and damage of the players to make sure that even a level 20 can still have a chance of duking it out with a level 80 in the arena and coming out victorious or not get one shot by them (of course this can be changed in the lobby settings but most people prefer to have balance on).There are also fun challenges you can complete in the circus like a boss rush for example, where you pit out against all of the bosses in a certain area, sometimes with modifiers so you might fight an invisible manticore from time to time. Or even an EXP arena where you have to kill a predetermined amount of enemies before fighting the boss, giving you quite the amount of loot I'm the end.With a ton of side quests there will never be something you can't do in the game. But if you do have all of the quests completed you can always flirt with pretty much any NPC in the game so it's not only an RPG but a dating simulator. (if you're in a place where the legal age of consent is 18 or above we do not suggest doing this as the game would be pedophile simulator but if it's around 17 to about 15 then it's legal :^) ) You can also be a total pervert and look up their skirts which is probably the best way to spend your time in the game.You can beat the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of santa until he drops you presents (I do not recommend you to do this as it'll put you on the naughty list for life)You can get a homeless man to give you money as an event and then flirt with him by giving him badges.

												I have played 10+ hours this game now, and it has been really good so far.--For short--Combat is perfect, game mechanics are good and easy to understand and as you lvl up they go deeper. Skilling system gives you freedom to choose what to specialize your character into. There seems to be also quite good looking PvP.Im not so sure about the lore cuz i havent been paying any attention to it.Only bad thing what i can say about this game is that the voice acting is pretty bad...But generally for free to play mmorpg this is really good choise give it a shot!!!

So Dragon Nest is not playable at all. THANK YOU FOR PREVENTING US TO CONSUME YOUR PRODUCT. THAT CHERRY, SO DELICIOUS, SUCH TASTE, MUCH HATE, WOWEDIT: Game works if you do this account register at the website with your browser.Also got my old account back.

												Sad thing happens. Cherry Credit don't let me play this game. First of all, I could not create Cherry Credit account. Why? Well I have tried millions of times and it does not accept normal email address. If I don't have Cherry Credit account I can not bind my account. Second who an earth will give social security number, passport number or driver's license number to some game or shady company.I played this game quite much before Cherry Credit. It was fun game, very action base. I had 4 level 80's. Now I don't even get access to my account and characters. Cherry Credit custom service didn't help any ways. We had a lot of conversation, but results was totally vain.So what I have learnt from my friend, you will loose everything thru this binding. Characters are naked, no guild, nothing at all left. All effort and money what they have spent are gone.I can not recommened this kind of game to anybody. If they are not able to do better data convertion from account base data, it is not worth to play. You never know when you loose everything again. And most of all, they should have done account binding automaticly from Dragon Nest Europe to Cherry Credit. So players would not have seen change in any ways. This was bad way implemented operation.			"

Loads of nests removed for future updates. Hopefully they come back even better :>.			"

												Holy crap this is the worst account setup process I have ever seen!So I download the launcher through steam right, and I've played before (on the US server I think) this was ages ago, but I had written down my password so I figured I might aswell try to log in with it. Nope. Well alright, lets click NO on the launcher and make a new account right? Except it wont let me enter a PIN. Okay, fine, the launcher sucks (did I mention it has now been 10 minutes because every time you launch the game there is a 66% chance it will just sit there for 4 minutes then say herpderp unable to connect or something like that. BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN LOGIN. Oh yeah and I also have to use a second email account because my first one is already in use, even though I can't login with it...Okay were on the website now, let's finally set up our account.WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DO I NEED TO INPUT AN ID?! This is the sketchiest thing ive ever seen for signing up for a game. Oh well, apparently all you need to do is hit ""Other"" and it will happily accept whatever words you type into the fields...Okay account is set up, let's go play. MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING LAUNCHER WHAT ACCOUNT INFORMATION ARE YOU CHECKING WHEN I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ABLE TO LOG IN YET. Okay after the third time or so I get to the login screen.Create character. Choose the facial features and whatever, DONE! Right? No, now you get a message saying you got disconnected (my friend got this too, it isn't just me I guess). And the game quits. Great, let's restart the launcher until it connects. Except my character was not even created, so I have to do that ""disconnected"" process again...This time however after the apparently mandatory restart it works and I can play. Only to find the camera angle when aiming is too low, so in some places to aim at the enemies I have to place my camera directly into some tall grass to aim. See a problem here? ♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not going to take any more of this bs.			"

												FROM A 2 HOUR PLAY EXPERIENCE At first i was sceptical from the screenshots, id assume that the game would be mostly about dressing up a character to look pervy as possible and have extremely weak gameplay but i was quite wrong. this game is a action rpg and is very true to that. its about hitting alot of targets at once while on the move, doging attacks and racking up a high combo while clearing a dungeon with a good score and a fast time, very arcady but in a good way. i have only played the warrior class to get a grip of a beginner in the game and i will say that the actions and skills look great. every move and attack you do gave me a impact that i was doing heavy damage. and having different skills that you can unlock and level up quests in this game are not a chore either ( from starting point) alot of the quests either involve talking to other npc's about retreiving items or following the main plot. this is fine as most fetch quests involve completing a dungeon and you dont need to specificly search for the item, just beat the crap out of the monsters and clear the dungeon to get your quest item.another good note is that the difficulty is set out very well, specificly telling you how hard a level is going to be, the exp you will earn and how large your party will need to be to get the most out of that difficulty. HERE IS A RUN DOWN....Good...Action/Skills make you feel powerful and look great though the animationsarcady action feelsimple quests/ easy to acheive if done properlydifferent difficulties give choice to go small or risk big for Expeasy to party up.Bad....Graphical quality ( i know the requirements are low but even on a high setting its not very impressive, kinda like WoW on low)limited character creation from startlag is introduced when in a hub with alot of players at oncenot really a MMORPG in my OPINION (more like a Action co-op RPG. due to the dungeon setup and and small party count in a dungeon at once)i would say more but i have not played enough to give a enitre opinion.

Early game is really boring to do a third time so I won't be jumping in again but it's still a pretty awesome game.

												The game in itself is pretty Awesome. It has a pretty solid gameplay and  the gameplay its what this game is all about.The gameplay   of this game feels like you are playing games Like TLOZ (3d ones).  It has 4 classes the warrior. Cleric. ranger and mage.I have tried the warrior class and ranger class so far and the ranger has a lot to wish for, e.g. the warrior makes combos and skills continuously moving all over the arena but the ranger is just shooting standing still (lacks of mobilty it does get some good skills but so far its just Aim and shoot) hiting just one enemie at a time unless you use skills. In my opinion is a boring class but that's just it. So if you want to try this game choose the Warrior class. and you'll see what I'm talking about.However it's a ""dungeon"" based game. which means no open world for the players , something like spiral knights. so if you are like me the game will make you feel ""trapped"". once you finish a dungeon you are just meant to go out of the dungeon and select if you want to be dropped at the town or the road before the dungeon. (to get to the dungeon you pass a portal from the town and it leaves you in a road which splits in two with other 2 portals that goes to different dungeons)Despite that is a very good game and you should try it. It's free so there's no losing.			"

												Holy crap this is the worst account setup process I have ever seen!So I download the launcher through steam right, and I've played before (on the US server I think) this was ages ago, but I had written down my password so I figured I might aswell try to log in with it. Nope. Well alright, lets click NO on the launcher and make a new account right? Except it wont let me enter a PIN. Okay, fine, the launcher sucks (did I mention it has now been 10 minutes because every time you launch the game there is a 66% chance it will just sit there for 4 minutes then say herpderp unable to connect or something like that. BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN LOGIN. Oh yeah and I also have to use a second email account because my first one is already in use, even though I can't login with it...Okay were on the website now, let's finally set up our account.WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DO I NEED TO INPUT AN ID?! This is the sketchiest thing ive ever seen for signing up for a game. Oh well, apparently all you need to do is hit ""Other"" and it will happily accept whatever words you type into the fields...Okay account is set up, let's go play. MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING LAUNCHER WHAT ACCOUNT INFORMATION ARE YOU CHECKING WHEN I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ABLE TO LOG IN YET. Okay after the third time or so I get to the login screen.Create character. Choose the facial features and whatever, DONE! Right? No, now you get a message saying you got disconnected (my friend got this too, it isn't just me I guess). And the game quits. Great, let's restart the launcher until it connects. Except my character was not even created, so I have to do that ""disconnected"" process again...This time however after the apparently mandatory restart it works and I can play. Only to find the camera angle when aiming is too low, so in some places to aim at the enemies I have to place my camera directly into some tall grass to aim. See a problem here? ♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not going to take any more of this bs.			"

												I´ve been playing this game for a while now and I have enjoyed it immensly. Solo playing doesn´t get too boring, at least at first, but I have yet to have got bored with solo playing, but it is also rewarding to do so. Still, the more, the merrier and this is what I have found out as upon playing quite a while with somebody, I found it even more fun with a third member in the group.One of the games greatest features is the fact that it´s Free to Play. I would never have picked this game otherwise, but I´m glad I did, as it has provided me hours of enjoyment. Them Kitty pets.. I love them!Cons I see about it are - while they don´t by any means ruin the game or gameplay - many typos spotted around, which I can understand I suppose if the game has been translated from Japanese/Korean, or so I believe it to be.

												One of the best games I have played in my life I have 6 level 80's and am frequently active on this game over and over I have played for 1400 hours and still enjoy the game theres still stuff to do even after 1400 hours the game has a lot of action and class variation 1-40 may seem a bit boring but wait till you get to the higher levels 60-80 (well 90 now) the game gets harder overtime and more intense you really feel like you have achieved something after a tough boss its not p2w but it does take time if your a free player. There's also constant events which make it nice for f2p players its not like other MMO's where you just click an enemy and it dies... I r8 1000/100 could not be better :DEdited: 02/03/2017This game is not what it used to be anymore its full of unbalanced classes using things called ""Awakenings"" however it can still be fun if you know what your doing they finnaly fixed a few things and made it much more friendly to new players so they can gear up faster it used to be that each 5 level you would get something called a ""Level up box"" but they changed that so Every 1 level you get one instead which imo is much better because it gives you more reason to level your character.They fixed some of the missions that where broken luckily and a lot of people seem to trash the steam version of this game saying that the non-steam is better and less buggy well I have been using the steam version since 60 cap and its no different.

												Full action packed, epic Boss fights, pretty decent story, a lot of different skills and stuffs, solo and coop missions with your friends - and its all free. Enough reasons to enjoy this game.For those Steam account makers - Register your account through web, not steam. Even better, download the game from website.			"

												I reccomend this game as it is a fun free to play RPG game where you can customise your character, do missions and generally have fun. What makes it more fun is the PVP and Co-op gameplay, especially on abyss mode. It really helps build teamwork as it is needed to get through some levels due to bosses being hard so reviving is needed. one thing that could be improved though is the fairly bad voice acting... Other than that, it is still a great game!8.7/10			"

												It was fun for a long while. The combat system was the best I've found in an MMO, none of that enemy selecting then choosing what power/ability you want to attack with. Then having to watch your character shuffle over to the bad-guy and watch him do a lil' animation and it loses health. Nah, you can actually move around when you attack. I don't normally play these Free to Play MMO's/RPG's due to micro-transactions and such a slow begining, and that's why I stopped playing it. Other people are used to this sort of gameplay though, I like my character to look a lot different from level 1 to level 10, not maybe larger shoulder pads and a different colour scheme. I like the way ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" does it, almost after every level your character looks a little bit different, that all adding up your warrior or mage can look like a badass at level 10 or 15. I'll stop rambling now as this recommendation review is turning into a rant. I recommend this game to anyone who has friends who also want to try this game out. I couldn't find anyone who wanted to play it with me in a party, taking out dungeons and sharing loot. It seems that if you're on your own you get loot for other classes 90% of the time, making it almost essential to have a party.			"

												I TOTALLY recommend this game,I don't understand what some people talk about when it is pay to win.Here are the good things!-GOOD--Interesting,useful characters-New characters every year-Specilization classes making it so that you decide for your character-Really fun with friends-Awesome abillities-Level 60 cap wow (and it gets extended soon)!-Great storylineNow here are the bad things-People have to pay for jelly to get 13+ gear-Bad customization-Minotaur nest seems to be very hard to do unless you have a level 40 on your team-Hard to find parties unless you are a Shooting Star class or Saint for example-Sorceress HP nowhere near makes up for their attack since you can complete nests without them anyway and they will probably die first-Pvp or pve side of classes can be bad since they don't TELL players that it is suited to pvp-Difficulty settings should be allowed in all nests Overall I would say it is a 6.5 rating. The combat is excellent and classes are mostly well made. Mainly the bad side is the difficulty and how you are supposed to handle that.			"

												Shortly this game is awesome.A lot of heroes and unlimited in all direction posibility to improve hero character .Graphics may be not the best but it possible to play on old PCs.I like that I can customize my own hero. In the begining it looks a litle bit boring, but after 10 or 19 level a huge world is opend and a lot of fantasctic action there. also I like that I can fight with other players (for me it like Mortal Combat but in RPG mode)You need to play.

												After the first hours I've got  to say it is entertaining. They don't smack a pay wall in your head, they don't lock content. Everything is accessable thanks to the trading market. Pets and mounts are given to you at certain levels, you can buy them with either real life money, or IG money. Neat! Combat system is skill based. I play on master and abyss difficulty as an assassin. It is  so fun! Got a 60 hit combo just by throwing a shuriken into a crowd of enemies. The game is very generous.			"

												Partial Controller Support is really only partial.You are able to move around and hit stuff with game pad only, but the menu and menu prompts still require you to use a keyboard. Button Layout is not intuitive - for example one of the skills gets triggered with Start. Gameplay Tutorials also ignore the controller and tell you only which keys to press.Could work better if you take the time to configure everything to your needs, but I couldn't be bothered.Otherwise, it might be a good game. Combat felt fast and fluid. Character creation offers not enough variation for my taste.			"

												For players, who are bored of playing other anime-style MMORPGs, such as S4, Fiesta Online, etc., I can recommend this game. There are 16 final classes, with different weapons, skills, roles, etc. This game has much better graphics than the other anime-style MMORPGs, looks so amazing for an anime-style MMO. The creators of this game didn't think about making low level abilities less spectacular, and making high level abilities more spectacular, all of the abilities are spectacular I think. Of course, there are big differences between low and high level skill in which is more spectacular, or less, but the low level skills are spectaculars too I think, unlike in most of the MMORPGs, where your low level skill is only a slash, or if you're an archer you shot 2 arrows instead of 1 (seriously?:D). A different between other MMOs and DN is there aren't incredibly huge armors, but there are big weapons, which feel like ""real ones"". *Spoiler*: (e.g.: if you are using a two-handed hammer, your attack moves are slower and look like you are nearly not able to hold your weapon, because that's too hard for you. It gives the game a special feeling I guess.) *End of spoiler* Crafting is easy I think, and the bosses...Bosses are incredibly and amazingly huge. It's an anime-style MMO, so bosses are so huge as I said before, and if they hit you, you'll better begin to think about healing yourself, or asking of helping. The game has story too. Nothing special, but It does have. Bugs: I didn't notice any bugs If I remember well, there's maintance only sometimes, and the game never crashes.  You can see I don't have any hours of gameplay on Steam because I had started to play this game before It was released on Steam, so don't worry, I gained experiences about this game :D I can only recommend this for players who want to try out and play an anime-style, fast-style MMORPG. Hope this review helped, you.			"

												I was going to play this, it looked rather fun, but when I go in-game, the cursor refuses to move an inch. Apparently the solution is to change the size of your display on the desktop itself. And to be honest, no. No I won't. This is such an odd issue that was never bothered to be fixed (As I have already seen the issue raised online, and in other mmo's), so I'm not going to be bothered with the game. Be it an engine issue, application issue, conenction issue, I don't really care, I am in no mood for it. Such a shame.			"

												Dragon Nest is one of the only MMORPGs I've been able to get behind. Unlike many other MMORPGs Dragon Nest doesn't force you to do this worthless gathering and hunting quests for the first 10-20h of playing. Instead Dragon Nest takes the fun part of MMORPGs which is dungeons, and they base the game around of that. So basically Dragon Nest isn't your usual MMORPG with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ side quests which you have to prowl through before getting to the good part of the game. The graphics are a bit outdated if not ancient, altough that is the charming part of the game. The game doesn't have that lock-on garbage like many other MMORPGs. Instead they hava a kind of hack and slash type of gameplay, which is a perfect fit for the game I won't lie though, dragon nest isn't problem free. Just like many other games Dragon Nest has its flaws. They couldn't have made it harder for players to actually get into the game, and when they get into the game it's a high possibility of the game crashing (personally I don't have these problems). Is it worth trying out? Yes, it's free! You won't losing anything by doing so.			"

												okay its free to play game, but the good equipments on game are not free and i think its such a waste of time to farm in this game, you have to do the same dungeon for like billion times and thats so boring. but wait, you still can buy cash item and sell them in the tradehouse for some gold, at least you have to spend 100€ then you can finally buy your equipments. after you spend some money for your equipments, there's an update for maximum level in game. so you have to leveling again then you buy some equipments again. and then comes the new classes, your class now is weaker than the new one, so what ? make a new character and do the same thing again. of course you can join someone party into the dungeon and get some equipments without converting some euros to in-game-gold, but not all player want to party with some weak character and not just the other players that would be a problem, monsters in the level 60++ dungeon are so unfair, you can die just by fart from the dungeon monsters.yeah i played this game and i enjoyed it at first, but then i look into my financial history and damn, thats a lot of money that i have spent on this game. no matter how many i have spend there's someone with the better equipment (not better skill) than me, i think skill in this game would be meaningless without good equipments. and because of this game i skip my classes and become unsocial-human-being, such a waste of time i think. my advice : dont take this game too seriously, just play it for fun. and my character on dn eu got banned because of real money trading, and i realised that is my fault. always read and understanding the rules of the game first.sorry for my broken english, not my native language, i hope this review help you guys whoever read it.

												I played this game till mid-game without the Steam client , and I really have to say: Give it a try! Sure the graphics aren't realistic , but if you accept the style you'll see they did good. There are some rumours about a pay-to-win system , but I looked up many information and I saw reviews online , you won't pay as much as you'd pay for an abonnement-game , it's porbably much less. And you really can't expect that the developers are content if they get paid with nothing , sure there are some costs in the endgame , but not higher than the price for one fastfood meal , they have to live somehow. So it's a nice game to play with friends , especially if you enjoy action combat. You'll get simpler graphics than in (for example) ""Vindictus"" , but more potential for long-time fun and a nice story. Also , don't get scared by the kawaiiness of the first scenes , it's getting cooler later.So grab some friends and start playing this , I want them to see that it is worth producing their Dragon Nest 2 to the end :PDeutsch:Testet es einfach , klar werdet ihr später im Endgame mal 5 Euro im Monat ausgeben müssen , aber dann lauft ihr halt 2 mal statt den Bus zu nehmen und die Sache ist erledigt , ehrlich , warum erwartet jeder ein Spiel das komplett gratis ist , gerade von deutschlandweit kleineren Entwicklern? O.oLernt den kindischen Grafikstil zu mögen und gebt dem Spiel ein paar Stunden eine Chance , das Gemetzel macht einfach Spaß :P			"

												Gorgeous anime graphics, Free aim, well balanced, Arena system  (PvP). Long sory shory its an amazing game and F2P aswell. The cash items are defintely NOT overpowered. The only turn off in this game for people like me is basically the instancing system instead of a open world. But then again it will be open world when Dragon Nest 2 is released :)			"

												Dragon Nest is a very simple and rather silly ""MMO"" with surprisingly fun combat.It's obvious they're working on a very tight budget, but that doesn't stop the game from being enjoyable. Though I've only played a bit so far so I don't know what it's like in the long run, my first impression is very positive.Here's the main points I'd focus on so far:-There's very little voice acting, and what there is isn't great. They've also left in some combat shouts that I assume is Korean.-The translation is rather poor in places and the quests are very basic.-The graphics are rather simple, but they're colorful and cartoony.-I put the quotes around MMO because the combat areas are instanced, and can only be shared with party members.-The combat areas are also (so far at least) very short and linear.-At the end of each instanced 'dungeon' you fight a mini-boss after which you get graded on how well you did, for example I've gotten A rank on the first few I've done.-Combat itself is responsive and the skills are fun to use. There is no forced locking on to enemies, you just do attacks and the enemies that are in range of the attack get hit.-There is very limited character creation. You can only choose class and then a few different hair/face styles. For example the Kali which I tried first is female only.If you're looking for an in depth MMO, this isn't for you. But if you're looking for something silly to kill mobs in a combat that's actually fun and not a boring TAB locking on snooze fest, and you don't mind the simplistic nature of it, I'd recommend trying Dragon Nest out.N.B. I've yet to try the cash shop at all, so I don't know if there are any 'p2w' elements or other unfair/bad/good sides to it.			"

												The gameplay of the game is solid and it is a very enjoyable game.Well it would be if it were not for the game breaking glitch you run into in the first bloody dungeon. You accept the level two quest to investigate the ridge and get the red mask. You complete the dungeon getting the quest item, only to have the game crash on you. Then you relog, you still have the quest item but you need to complete the dungeon again. No big deal. You beat the boss again to find out that you can't talk to the npc because you can't pick up the quest item because you already have the quest item. Logical conclusion would be to try again, you try again. Same result. Next conclusion is to abandon the quest or to relog. Relogging a second time does nothing, complete the dungeon, can't talk to npc due to not picking up quest item, can't pick up quest item due to you already having it. Quest item is non destroyable btw. Abandoning the quest is the same. You lose quest item, do the dungeon, pick up red mask, game crashes(this second crash, i actually got a message stating the game ran into a problem), relog, redo dungeon, can't finish quest due to not picking up quest item due to you already having it.They will probably fix this bug eventually but until they do, new players can't progress past the second quest in the game past the intro. meaning they can still level up and get stronger but they will only be able to do the first dungeon. Do note, that completing the first dungeon S rank gives 20% xp at level 3. Imagine trying to get max level with small amount of xp. At the same time, there is no point in doing the higher tiers of the same dungeon either, you won't have good enough gear to do them due to not being able to progress.Until the bug is fixed. game can't be played by new players. When the bug is fixed, i will return to playing it within a heart beat. After all, i do like the game from a gameplay, visual and story standpoint.			"

												Lookie here. This game is amazing for what it is. The developers really did an outstanding job with this game because they managed to cram alot into a small space. They have unbeivalbly long quests which can be good and bad. Good: They provide alot of gameplay to keep you entertained half the time. Bad: Alot of most of the quests are just talking to NPC's. But yeah, this is a neat little, well actually it's pretty big, game which offers a cross hair type playstyle MMO all about going into dungeons and tearing up the joint which is suprisingly entertaining for what it is. The game may not look all to amazing compared to standards set by games such as Battlefield 4 and such but it has a real nice art style which boasts some awesome looking skills with explosions, swing effects and such as you would expect. All of it looks real nice. I enjoy alot about this game. If you're looking for a game which can distract you for a while I highly recommend it due to it's simplistic play style and easy to 'jam' into combat system. Also it's just like any other MMO so you can ditch those high expense games like World of Warcraft or Guild Wars and check out this FREE game! I highly recommend it! (emphasis on FREE!!!)			"

												So, this game was pretty dang fun, I remember waiting AGES for it to come out in the EU, when I did, I was thrilled;- Simple interface and allocation system, there wasn't too much on the screen at once and it was pretty basic- The combat was fluid and unique, a nice change from most of the point and click RPG's and has some nice skills and effects- Classes were quite nicely varied, none of the classes felt too similar and there was some variety in the proceeding jobs.- The games pacing was pretty ok, there wasn't a time, for me at least where I felt underpowered, however, there are moments that require you to be a certain level and could cause some frustraion, I found myself a few levels lower than the restriction a lot of the time, but the circus allows for some quick and easy farming.- It's not pay2win, the game absolutely does not require any money involved if you want to get high level, there are lots of events for free things and Life Scrolls are kinda common, besides that, most of the cash items are cosmetics. However:- The voice acting is pretty abbysmal.- Story was not innovating at all, for me at least, keep in mind this is personal opinion, but I think the voice acting is almost factual. It's not a big issue, but still an issue none the less. I would think this fairly sums up the game, I would definately recommend it but as of right now, I am really not happy about the wipe as the game has now gone to CHERRY, who appear to have the worst account making system I have ever seen, I'm not sure about the dedication of the team, to me, they seem a little bit like they are milking the game, as most content changes weren't great, such as the new class, this is personal opinion, but I really didn't like Machina, at all.

												Although the game is really fun to play, at the endgame you run into a brick wall, seeing how it's really damn hard to find a group to do a Nest, and even then, most of the Nests require you to do other Nests first, meaning to do the actual Nest you wanted to do, despite gear and everything, so, for the true endgame content, your chances are almost 0%, since people do NOT have the patience to help you with the previous nests required, meaning, yeah, this is almost a single player experience with really poor translations, unless you're playing with a friend, in which case, yes, the game feels amazing, but, with friends, what game doesn't?Now that that's out of the way, I'll also mention something that, granted may not happen to everyone, but to me and a friend of mine, it did, which is, after every darn week or so, the game files become corrupted, meaning you will crash at launch, and the only way I found to fix is is to reinstall the game, but no, not reinstall back on the same partition you installed it previously, cause that won't fix it, you'll have to install the game on a different partition...Fortunately, I had 4 other partitions, but I am running out of them if this keeps up.As much fun as I have with the game, I unfortunately can not bring myself to recommend it given these issues, maybe the Nest part can be that I'm not one that likes to waste hours in town talking random and pointless talk with other players, and if you played MMOs, you know what pointless talk I mean, but, ofc, not for them cause, they probably know each other IRL, so yeah, there's that.

												I was a CBTester for this back in SEA.I immediately fell in love with this game because of the combat system, its one of the most fun i have ever seen in an MMO.I played this game in SEA for about 2 or 3 years before i ended up quitting, mostly because of the Pay-to-Win, now i have to say the EU version did not have the same sort of P2W as SEA did, but now they offically sold themselves to CherryCredits (The publisher for SEA).The game itself is only fun because of the combat system, i cannot say this enough.Developers of this game keep insisting on making it worse over the years, they have removed more content than adding new. The endgame is basically non existant as of now, in the current patch they removed literally all of the ""Nests"" (Raids) in order to ""improve"" them and there is no ETA on when they are going to be returning. I must add that the endgame of this game was absolute garbage to begin with and removing the small amount what there was is completely idiotic.The end game (how it was at least before it was removed) consisted on running Raids with a weekly clear limit to farm up equipment pieces and crafting materials, it is utterly mind numbing and tedious to run the same stuff every week until you hit the cap, and as of now there is only 1 end game raid, since they removed the rest.The PvP was also one of the bigger things in the game, since obviously there is nothing else to do, but the PvP side in EU at least has been dead as far as i know pretty much from the beginning, in SEA it was more prominent.But now since the SEA version and the EU version are practically ran by the same company, it might get better, but im afraid it can only get worse since now the P2W aspect will come to play more strongly.TLDR:The combat system is fun, but that is all that there is.No endgame, Nothing to do, Farming is pointless since there is nothing to farm for unless you run Nests which have a small weekly limit.I might go back to visit this game in the future, but i will definetly not be staying around for long.Im not saying the game is a complete waste, its pretty good if you want to waste some time, but thats all it is.

												This game requires active aiming. There's no target lock. This MMO has a very unique combat system not often seen in MMO's. My favorite is the Archer where you actually have to aim with a crosshair to hit anything at all.			"

												I've played this game a lot in the past, and I liked it a very much. I played it together with a few friends, and because we didn't play it on our own, we could enjoy this game which would normally be a massive grindfest. The game is still good, but the registration system got changed in such a significant way that 80% of all people who want to play this game cannot even make an account. Good job. Based on the actual game, regardless of the screwed up registration system there is now, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. But for now, unfortunately, I'm going to have to give it a6/10 "

												If you like a game where you cant possible get lost, and I mean impossible then this game is for you. Add repetetive attacs and you have this game. Its a clear the stage area in the shortest time possible. The graphics are amazingly beautiful the controls are simplistic as they can get.The tutorial is short but damn annoying you get tips on how to walk and kick that covers the whole screen, cant be turned off, Feels like a mobile game. After 4 levels of running in a straight line killing stuff repetitive attacks I got boredThis is not a mmo game. I can give it a multiplayer status with co op features.			"

												First of all i think this Game is one of the best i have played in a long time.The Pros: Addictive.Loads of Skills.Cute Anime.The Combat system is unique and is very Polished.The Graphics are Good.Unique Classes.The Effects (Skill Animations) Look Amazing and over the top.Pleanty of levels.Lots Of cosmetics (have to buy Most).Easy Grinding.Diffrent channels (This Reduces the ammount of lag you will get in game Due to the ammount of people connected)Lots of unique creatures/enimies to fight (including the boss).Cons:(P2W) Some of the items do increase your stats so it is a P2W in some respects.Limited Classes at the start.Repetative Dungeons. Annoying/Pointless Talking Quests.Some non-skip Cut Scenes.Collecting/Gathering Gold is difficult (unless you Buy gold) or (Farm)Non-Solo Dungeons/Nests (You cannot solo some nest's becasuse the enimies are OverPowered).In my opinion this game is Great and i loved every minute playing this. LVL Cap: 70 but rising to 80.Also you can get to lvl 70 in about a week.Thank you for reading this and i hope i helped :) "

												""blazingly fast combat action with visually stunning skills"" lol:D Such trap I can't believe i fall for this:D After watching LazyPeons video on youtube i decided to give it a try and oh boy what a disaster so far. First - you can't jump without fully stopping even when you are running it's so annoying is beyond every logic of any action combat game. In combat you are required to use jump, because some skills are only useable when you are in air, and while you are in combat its ridiculous when you are trying to execute that sweet dash move to avoid being hit, but instead you come to full stop for like 0,5 secs just to jump and slightly move to the direction you were moving:D 2nd thing you are required to fully stop to pick up that loot witch drops in tons, so much time comsuming its ridiculous, it makes you don't want to pick that loot:D 3rd game is so heavily instanced it doesn't feel open at all. Also, when you are equipping gear you can't move camera around to see how your new gear looks, you are required to close your character sheet and close inventory. Also when you zoom in on your character it blurs out your character so heavily you became one large pixel:DDD Usually games tend to blur out the enviroment around you to highlight the character but not in this broken mad world of dragon nest:D It's so broken and yet its been out for like 5 years now and I'am just lvl 6 and ive seen things man beyond bad:DD I have no idea how players are positive about this, I have to play more to find out if my initial opinion changes cause so far its a punishment to play this noncense:D			"

												Things I like- Several classes to pick from.- Feels easy to control the character- The map shows recommended level for different zones.- The quest tracker points the way to where you have to go.- Dungeons are short and easy to figure out, which lets you focus on learning your character abilities and mechanics.Thngs I don't like:- Very limited options for customizing character looks. You can't even have blond hair.- A flashing button says ""You have new mail"", but nothing happens when I click it. - Ads pop up in your face.- Identical items don't stack automatically.- Often when I try to ctrl+esc out of the game nothing happens.- To exit a dungeon you have to press F12 - the same button that triggers Steam to make a screenshot. And you can't change the control.- There's a bit much cinematics, like every time you talk to an npc or enter a dungeon. I wish I could turn it off.- Dungeons give me either lvl 5 items or lvl 15 items.. I'm level 9.			"

												A good game that is fun at first.After some time it's all about grinding.But the worst part is dissconections.I often want to play in the morrning because I am more focused,but each time I do I get at least 1 dissconect and it happens right when I am clearing a dungeon or nest.That is really frustrating.Afternoon the servers are soo crowded that being in city is almost impossible to move due to laggs.One more part that I found out recently is that some nests cant be accessed anytime.They are limited to just one day.That is really bad.There is probably a lot more problems that I didnt mention,so I would definetly not reccomend this game.

												If you like MMORPG's this a relaxing game for you. It's different than others, with a little 'childish' aspect in it. This aspect makes the game more fun. Pick one of the classes and start leveling it, maximum level is 70. You can create more than 1 character too! It's not only fun to level more character, but also effective! By combining the levels from different kind of characters, you can unlock skills you can't with just 1 character. This motivates you to continue leveling.The graphics are ok, but it's not a game you should play because of the graphics. The gameplay is balanced and the combat is great. A lot of action, hack-and-slash mostly.A lot of quests can be found anywhere, no matter where you look, you'll find some. The quests mostly ask you to go in an 'instance', but these are possible to solo.Playing this game with a friend or more than 1 friend makes it even more fun. Compare each others skills and damage within the dungeons, explore new spells and share your thoughts about the class you're playing.Every day there are random events that can be found at the 'events planner', which can be found in any city.This game is relaxing and fun to play. This game is Free-to-Play, but there is a 'real-money'-shop available for the 'hardcore'-players. With the real money, you can buy costumes, gems, etc. etc.It's totally different from other MMORPG's, but it's comparable with 'Eden Eternal' or any of this kind. Not hard, easy to understand and fast to play.Pros- Fast-paced combat- 'Childish' aspect- Lots of quests- Events to do besides your daily questing.Cons- Melee classes are Male-only- Ranged classes are Female-only- Lot of high-levels begging for 'Likes'Rating7.5/10The game is awesome, relaxing and fast-paced.Recommended?Yes, I recommend it. It's a Free-to-Play game, so you won't need any money. It has a lot of gameplay, which lets you get to a maximum of level 70. Combining characters-levels will unlock even more skills. Playing the game with friends is a good idea. Playing it for days/weeks/months is possible.			"

												I was in love with that game when it was still beta releace. But thy have fuc'ked up all game now. It's to easy game. I can play it with blinded. This game was fun when u had the Difficulty settings. Because Veteran players like me had a chance for challege. I am so sad because of it. Infident mana and no CD. (Cooldwon) on spells is to rediceles. Soyea. If there is someone who can say. (This game is so hard) Then to Hack and Slash type games are not for u. I played it before. and eaven if I got on lvl 40. There was no challenge on the higest difficult. So it get's boring. If u can allready 1 hit evry god dam enemy up on lvl 15. Then I can say this. U need to change things for this game. Or u will louse all hard core DN players!			"

												Absolutely mediocre. Nice action system, but it's quite easy to land attacks. Everything based on putting enemies on the ground. The world is closed and divided into really small parts. Linear progression, not too many quests. Also it feels weird when jumping and walking. Lots of invisivble walls and stuff that makes an aRPG game look weird and awkward.			"

												Most people are negative about this game now since ''Cherry Credits'' took over the game.I must admit after that things went wrong.But its good that DN-STEAM works again so you dont have to worry about that.If you have problems you should contact the Cherry support it helped me aswell.But next to that it is still a fantastic game to play with amazing graphics.The game is mainly based on 80-90 lvls, but since they added more awards for lower levels its easy to defeat dungeons and do quests/exp.At lvl 90 (max) the game becomes super fun and you can do raids with friends and clear some nice nests and dungeons with friends/guildies.Definitely next to some technical issues still one of the best MMORPG's on the internet.

												Dieses MMORPG hat mich von Anfang an immer mehr überrascht. Es gibt sehr viele Dungeons und der Main Quest begleitet einen bis zum Ende durch das Spiel, statt wie bei anderen nach den ersten 10 leveln aufzuhören.Allerdings hat das Spiel auch seine Schattenseiten wie bsp. dass es nicht genug Quests zur Auswahl gibt und man mit jedem neuen Charakter dieselben Quests immer und immer wieder macht. Die ersten 100h fand ich das Spiel interessant und bis jetzt habe ich gerade einmal 4 Klassen ausprobiert. Allerdings ist es mir zu einfach. Man kann ohne viel Mühe sehr viel sehr schnell erreichen.			"

												For starters, I could not really bring up a good point about this game, even if my life depended on it.-  Too easy!  o but really, I am not a ""hardcore"" gamer, but this game is made for people with 0 Mental capability or motor skills. I was clearing lvl 23 dungeons on lvl 15 on hard mode without dieing a single time.-  Not rewarding! As said you clear high level dungeons you get nothing out of it. It will drop you stuff, but the level caps are ridiculous, so you won't be able to use it to anything.-  Gearing is a joke!  You get a SINGLE set of armor for about ever 5 lvl. Yes A SINGLE F*KING ONE!!!! There is no chosing between gear, or grinding for items with better stats, you get one which you use til you reach the next level cap for the next set of stuff.-  Immesurably boring!  The whole ame is a tutorial. God help me I tried, I really tried I reached lvl 26 but there are still tutorial quests. They could have explained the game mechanics in the first 2-3 levels completely, they chose to drag it out for no good reason.-  So boring you will want to end your life!  They foce you to emty dungeons 4 levels below you ( as I said even 10 level above it is way too easy) in repetative quests, which supposedly are funny. You will enter the same easy dungeon about 10 times, thinking there is absoulutely no merit in this, just so at the 3rd rom you meet someone for a 2 line dialoge to finish an unrewarding quest.I really suggest look trough the positive rewievs of this game are made mostly by people with 2-3 games on account ( obviusly fake accounts only to praise the game ). This game took every element of a good MMORPG and made it anoying. I really enjoy grinding, but this game does not reward it the slightest bit, you can not get better gear by farming, it does not worth challenging harder dungeons.If you wish to stay sane, or just want to have fun, stay far away from this game.

												 I played this game for years before finally quit, mainly because I reached a stage in my life that required me to focus on other things beside this game, and I just didn't had the time to play any more. From what I can see, the registration system chagned, and it sucks. The good thing is that you can just put whatever information you want and you're good to go. I don't see this as a reason not to play the game. The things that I hate about the game tho are pretty simple - right now is hard for me to actually enter the game, create a character and start playing, because the process is laggy and full of bugs. A lot of times when I try to create a character or log in the ""Disconnected from server"" error keeps apearing and it gets me out of the game. Also, a thing I noticed, whenever you try to create a character, you create it, then you kind of have to quit the game and enter again to be able to actually see the character you created. This is pretty horrible if you want to create multiple characters and play with a lot of them. Those are the two main problems I see with this game - the hard registration process and the bugs the game has from time to time. Beside that, I did not play enough of it to see how it works with all the new updates. I did not play the game for a while, but the way I remember it, was pretty good.  The only thing I do not like is that at high levels things get a little too hard, especially if you want to play alone, and not have a cleric or tank with you. If you're a mage at high levels, well good luck with that.  Beside those problems, the game is great. Awesome combat system, decent graphics, skills that look like skills, not like little lights comming out of your weapons, and interesting dungeoons.  My opinion - a good game, beside the bugs and hard progress at high levels. Play this game to have fun and don't take it too seriously - it will get horrible at level 50-60.			"

												Pretty much the same.. but instead of a big open world, you get tiny cities with portals to a lot of dungeons that can be played in many dificulties.I have played untill level 10, and here is what I found:Tutorial is weak..History is weak..Craft is almost zero..Didn't see any mounts/pets at all (nobody using)..NPC conversation is boring..And of course, there is a realmoneycurrency that buys the entire game..The only thing I found cool is the ""FPS-like"" combat system..If you are searching for a free MMO-RPG to have real fun on steam, I recommend ""RIFT"" or ""Path of Exile"".

You cant make a proper game that is pleasing to the consumers and aswell avoid them getting angry, the first thing this game does is getting me angry and does not deserve my attention. Srsly hire some people that know what they are doing before you make another game, or just hire me.			"

												another silly braindead f2p tooney fantasy INSTANCE RPG for pedophiles...I really don't understand who likes graphics that look like they're designed for 4 year olds...I don't mind games being mature and sexualized.. but I find it extremely bizarre when it's all stupid cartooney kid graphics and the avatars behave like they're about to do porn.. The gameplay is mindless, replicated instances- skill spam. There is literally zero char customization to start with, the area you begin in is full of characters who look the same.  Maybe I just hate christmas and can't stand that there's still a christmas theme even though it's THE FLIPPING 11th of January. Games like these.... ""fantasy"" stupid anime cartooney graphics for pedophiles or kids who are entering into puberty. Either way this is creepy / annoying /♥♥♥♥♥♥ Can't we just stop making pathetic anime/cartooney free to play fantasy rpg's for one fkn second? How about a little bit of inguinety.. and morons stop paying for this trite garbage... unless you're a pedo then I'm sure you'll love this. I tried to give it a go because there's seemingly nothing else f2p other than these types of games.. maybe there's some kind of fun to be had but no... lazy design.			"

												Fun and intense, true free fighting Dragon Nest is one of my favorite MMO's that are free to play. Its diverse fighting is one of the best little features in the game. Anime style graphics make this game look great. When your fighting you will definatley feel like you are breaking the earth. Only setbacks of this game is it is gender locked and that there isnt very much character customization. Sooner or later though NA (North America) will get more classes such as the Assassin which is Dragon Nests' biggest project at the minute. The Assassin is only available in its birth place, Korea, and is based on what his name is, an assassin. Very good game, despite those bad features the game looks great and is very fun and addicting.			"

												One of the better F2P MMORPGs that I've played. I did clock a lot more hours previously, possibly when it was in beta, and it's certainly one of the ones I've invested most time into among its counterparts plaguing the genre.The game itself works similarly to Vindictus with instanced dungeons & loot hoarding so there is grinding involved which I'm sure is an instant nope for a lot of people. With this in mind, most quests will consist of you carrying out certain objectives around the different dungeons and while the dungeons do have difficulty settings to choose from, most of the difficulty scaling will simply come from higher level dungeons. Aside from the dungeons there is also a PVP mode which has quite a few different modes available including a ladder.The 'dynamic' combat of the game is surprisingly satisfying compared to other games that feature this style of combat and each class does have a nice variety of skills to compliment that. Each main class can specialize into two different sub-classes which you can later specialize even further which provides some nice choice for those who make alts like there's no tomorrow.The game by no means compares in visual fidelity to Vindictus but does have a nice vibrant style which suits the game well aesthetically. The overall sound is pretty commendable too ranging from satisfying sound effects to a well made sountrack that's not too overpowering. There is also a lovely Christmas song that plays in towns for those lucky to play during the Christmas event. The voice acting isn't particularly great in most cases but the lines are kept short so it should bearable even for the less tolerant.Keeping in mind that the game does involve grinding I'd only be inclined to recommend to those who are fine with that. If that's the case then by all means I recommend you give the game a shot, it is free after all.A minor complaint for the Steam version specifically is that the ""Exit Dungeon"" key is F12 which is also Steam's screenshot key by default, while most keys can be rebinded I see no option for this one in particular so you might want to change the key on your own Steam beforehand.

												One of the better F2P MMORPGs that I've played. I did clock a lot more hours previously, possibly when it was in beta, and it's certainly one of the ones I've invested most time into among its counterparts plaguing the genre.The game itself works similarly to Vindictus with instanced dungeons & loot hoarding so there is grinding involved which I'm sure is an instant nope for a lot of people. With this in mind, most quests will consist of you carrying out certain objectives around the different dungeons and while the dungeons do have difficulty settings to choose from, most of the difficulty scaling will simply come from higher level dungeons. Aside from the dungeons there is also a PVP mode which has quite a few different modes available including a ladder.The 'dynamic' combat of the game is surprisingly satisfying compared to other games that feature this style of combat and each class does have a nice variety of skills to compliment that. Each main class can specialize into two different sub-classes which you can later specialize even further which provides some nice choice for those who make alts like there's no tomorrow.The game by no means compares in visual fidelity to Vindictus but does have a nice vibrant style which suits the game well aesthetically. The overall sound is pretty commendable too ranging from satisfying sound effects to a well made sountrack that's not too overpowering. There is also a lovely Christmas song that plays in towns for those lucky to play during the Christmas event. The voice acting isn't particularly great in most cases but the lines are kept short so it should bearable even for the less tolerant.Keeping in mind that the game does involve grinding I'd only be inclined to recommend to those who are fine with that. If that's the case then by all means I recommend you give the game a shot, it is free after all.A minor complaint for the Steam version specifically is that the ""Exit Dungeon"" key is F12 which is also Steam's screenshot key by default, while most keys can be rebinded I see no option for this one in particular so you might want to change the key on your own Steam beforehand.

												So after giving this game 88.7 hrs (according to right now) I have this to say:I love this game. The combat is amazing and the dungeons are great. However, this game could've been so much better than it is currently (even though I will keep playing it).CONS: The quests are not engaging at all. No matter the quest, if it's in a dungeon you'll clear it pretty much automatically just by finishing the dungeon. Also, if you like to complete ALL quests, you'll be sent to the same dungeons about a thousand times over. Main quest especially. I had 8 possible dungeons I could visit at one point. It first sent me to the first dungeon, then the second, then the first, then the second, then the second again, then the first, then the third and then all those three. It gets repetitive really fast. The translation in this game is horrible. I gave up pretty fast reading anything (and it's a lot of text), since it doesn't make any sense because of grammatical and linguistic errors. There's a lot of other errors with the text as well, such as more than 50% of quests I've done points to the wrong dungeon (in the text, they are correct in the quest log) Voice acting is lacking in more ways than one. Many characters aren't voiced and many cut scenes aren't voiced. Others are, and that's where the weird stuff happens. Some keeps their original asian voices while some has new english speaking voices. Overall, I think the game should make up it's mind if it wanted to keep the original voices or add new ones, it just feels half-done. This game can be played without paying a dime, but you gain so much from spending some money on it. Because of that it's pretty much P2W. You can basically only get ""costumes"" (stuff that looks better than the gear you have) by spending money. This would've been fine, if it wasn't for the fact that these costumes have stats! Pretty high stats too! This is also a problem since I want to use costumes I think looks nice, but I'm pretty much forced into using costumes with better stats instead. If you have a problem with female skimpy dresses, this game is probably not for you. My archer has such short skirt you can basically see her whole butt at all times. I don't really mind though, but I know many do.So these cons above could seem to be a deal breaker. So why am I recommending  this game? Because of all the pros:PROS: Amazing combat system. I've been playing as an archer and I'm in love with everything. This is the main point of the game it's done incredibly well. You can definatly feel your skill level go up when you play this game. Playing makes you better and gear truly makes a difference. Lot's of customization options for your characters looks and playstyle. It's great and it really feels like I can play the game just as I want to. Quite generous events. You'll get a lot of stuff doing them and it's pretty much only worth buying anything during an event since you can sometimes more than double your moneys worth. Seems to have a somewhat kind and good community. Everyone I've talked to have been quite nice. Very good oppurtunities for the single lone wolf player (such as me). Pretty much everything but the late game is doable solo even at the hardest difficulties. As a archer anyway, haven't played the other classes.  You can get rich by playing the auction-house game if that's what you are interested in. You'll probably need a special P2Get auction house ticket to do it though.These pros make a very enjoyable game. It does have a lot of shortcomings though which I hope (but doubt) will be fixed in the future. I'm enjoying it, so I'll give it a thumbs up. You'll have to test it out for yourself though to see if the cons are too much for you.			"

You can get rich by playing the auction-house game if that's what you are interested in. You'll probably need a special P2Get auction house ticket to do it though.These pros make a very enjoyable game. It does have a lot of shortcomings though which I hope (but doubt) will be fixed in the future. I'm enjoying it, so I'll give it a thumbs up. You'll have to test it out for yourself though to see if the cons are too much for you.			"

												pros:-cool animations, FX and BGM/OST-gameplay flows well (when you attack - see below)-they are finally balancing the game-exp grind to level cap is relativelly short compared to most MMORPGs-TONS of dungeons-interesting skill tree/build mechanics to play around withcons:-getting hit/speed debuffed makes you realise that the flow of movement overall sucks-best gear & skill tree reset cash locked-sub best gear daily/weekly grind locked (booo repetitive)-too easy, i can tank 20+ hits from a boss with a squichy class and kill him in less than 15sec-BS party wipe mechanics aka the only ""challenging"" thing in the gameI recommend it IF :-you never played MMORPGs and want to try one-you like the way the game looks			"

												After trying this game out for a bit, I have decided to write a review.Dragon Nest is an instance based RPG. The graphics are outdated but still tolerable.Where this game really shines is the fighting. The attacks are completely over the top and nicely animated. There's big explosions, fire, poison and all the stuff you need. Just awesome. The characters are gender locked and customization is not really a thing, but I don't mind that at all. Some quests are a bit tedious (talk to x, talk to y, talk to z), but the action easilly outweighs them. If you like to (or have to) play alone, you can still get pretty far - I've recently reached level 60 basically all by myself. So, overall I'd give this game a solid 8/10 and I definitely recommend it.			"

												I play this with friends so my experience may vary from those who would play alone.So far I have enjoyed this game very much. The combat is enjoyable and rewarding since you feel powerfull from level 1.However you can change this by fighting more difficult dungeons where you still feel very powerfull untill you notice your health seems to be disappearing at an alarming rate eventhough your enemies are being obliterated.This game is already worth your time for just playing the dungeons.The pvp I have only played 1v1 matches against my friends and that shows that some classes dont really balance out against eachother.

												Let me think about this game...It has been a while since I played it (Halloween 2014) and how was it?Well from what I remember the combat was good, quite fast and fluid, but there was a fixed amount of enemies, that makes it a bit less fun, it was a lot of running around from dungeon to dungeon, clear the way to the leader, die, revive and kick the butt of what ever killed you...There were enough classes and enemies, oh and sub-classes, to keep it interesting, which is nice and all, but those badass dragons you see up there, in the screen place, I havent seen any, but hey, I was not that far in the game.I did not come far in the game because I switch way too much in MMORPG's I start as rogue, move up to mage, ect, ect. that caused me  to be slow here.So? take it or leave it? Well for a free game it is not bad, not bad at all, keeps you interested a bit, does some original things, but nothing great. On a rating system from 1 to 10 this would be a 6 (barely better then avarage if compaired to paid games).Now the question is: Do you want to play a fun mediocer game for free? I guess the mayority will do so, so I recommend this game, for those that do not expect anything great. Disclaimer: I might be wrong about sertain aspect of the game, maybe combined aspects of a totally other game with this one, this has been done from memory that has been jolted by the scenes from above here, also the game may have greatly improved from the last time that I played, so only believe me when I am talking about the core elements of this game.

												I play this game quite often, and i really enjoy it. But recently I stopped and asked myself why i like it so muchYou know how in any MMO you have to grind like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by killing monsters one by one? Well here you grind like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ killing Dozens of enemies at the same time. That's why i love it.The only downside is the dungeon are always laid out the same way, so when grinding you litterally kill dozens of monsters the same way everytime, they pop up out of the same place everytime.Also i don't quite like most of the bosses, well i had nothing against that until the amazing Manticore fight where you actually have to do stuff to survive and not simple spam your skills until it dies.Overall good game, the graphics might hurt your eyes a little, but hey, people still play Florensia soooo			"

												Some comments say pay 2 win and in all honesty thats a lie!Dragon nest takes back to the roots of how the class system once was if you remember games such as ragnarok you know what I'm talking about.Dragon nest while being in the grindy side offering so much time to get to the next level in which you will find repetitive boring, but for those of you looking for a challenge when it comes to dungeons you've come to the right place.In Dragon nest as you progress you will find Dungeons called NEST and in these NEST everything changes you will need to find a team filled with skilled people along with the best equipment of that level unless your that ONE guy who thinks he can solo everything into the highest difficulty be my guest.Back to pay 2 win: NO what you find in the shop is merely aesthetics which do give you a tiny bit of advantage in stats however to balance this you can get these with in game events as well for free just play!So should you play Dragon Nest: Meh!

												This game is fun, really fun.There are 7 playable classes, (Warrior, Archer, Assassin, Cleric, Tinkerer, Kali and Sorceress), each one leading to 2 subclasses that lead to another 2 subsubclasses. Each class is unique and powerful in its own way, it's fun to play as every single character, by default you can't have up to 12 characters so you have a lot of options.The anime like visuals may not be up to date but suit the game very well and the animations look gorgeous and detailed, frame-by-frame. The textures aren't very good, they look like ```` most of the times.The abilities are the best part, every time you use one it feels like you are actually the one doing the ability, the sound and animations do their job very well.This isn't a open world kill monsters MMO, instead the monsters are in dungeons. The dungeons have a number of levels, and in last level there is a boss (duh), after beating the boss you get a reward depending on the difficulty chosen and a grade showing how much you suck.The Nests are like, mega dungeons, where it's best to have a party with you and you get really good rewards at the end of the Nest. You can only do one Nest a certain number of times per week, I don't like that.The story is skipable, I personally don't read it, the voice acting is garbage, but the funny kind of garbage.The PvP is amazing, it really is, if you fight someone your level you will see what I mean, I do not recommend fighting someone that is 5 or more levels above you, it may be frustrating, and only go PvP at level 15. The bad thing about PvP is that they change the stats, cooldowns and cost of abilities from PvE, wich isn't a bad thing, but it's kind of bleh, you strongest ability that does 10.000 damage only does 3.000 damage now. But it's balance stuff, so don't worry. The updates are slow, and for them to compensate that, they make Events, they may add new mini-levels, temporary raids or seasonal stuff. Besides that they just add costumes that you need to buy with money (update.png). I really hope they add new updates soon, this has a level 70 cap, but other servers, like the korean ones, have a level 80 cap and a new class. We will need to wait a while for that to reach Europe ;_;.  Just to finish it off, those people saying ''Dis p2w u can't pley dis >lel'' are very wrong. You can play this without wasting a single cent, you just need to work hard to get to that point, and also have some luck :3. You can get money items/costumes from the trading house that people sell, and also from events.  The last very important thing is that you shouldn't quit the game before reaching level 24. At level 24 is where you get the good stuff, your first official set and it is also the point where you should be moving to the next city, where you will see if you really want to quit or not, because of the new dungeons, nests and npcs. If you are still doubting the game and you made it to level 24, just play untill you can do the 2nd nest, then your decision should be final. But to those idiots saying ''Well I reached level 13 and this game is garbage...'' '' Oh! I reached level 20 and this sux!!1'', let me say that you are a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot. I recommend playing with friends, or getting a guild, the community here is very friendly and you may find many friends here, like I did.This review does say a lot of good things, but the game has its flaws, some may even quit because of the art style, or even the voice acting. Note this, the game isn't perfect, I said what I really loved about it and what people should be looking to get.			"

												I can't say that I didn't like RPG's, I mean I did, I found Final Fantasy REALLY annoying and I would have never thought I would change my mind with this type of game.It reminds you of skyrim, cause of it's ""open-world"" and the ability to level up, blacksmith, casts spells among others.Oh I had the greatest of memories with my friends here and sadly I can't get them back, cause they got bored of this game (the reason i'll never know why).I'm not very good at reviewing games let alone PLAYING them, but enjoying it is what I do best, and I guess other gamers do too.I can't give specific reasons to why I love this game cause i'm far from completing it. Let's say that holding a giant♥♥♥♥♥sword and bashing the ground and kill the enemies in one hit is the most hilarious thing ever in this game.That's it, have fun with this game. If you don't like this genre, it's never too late to try.And oh, just cause someone says ""It's bad"" doesn't mean that it'll ruin your experience with the game.			"

Up to level 50 it should be pretty much easy if u gear yourself to decent (epic set +6) cost around 10-20 gold(set materials in trading house) if you buy it or you can do the nests for the sets :) there are quite a lot of helpfull players on the server which will carry you in nests ^^.After level 50 the gameplay pretty much gets harder. When you hit level 80 you will probably need to work as a team with other players to complete daily quests for being able to get gear and stuff cuz the dungeons will have to be made on abyss/chaos difficulty which is pretty hard for ungeared players. The game has a lot of features and the combat system is sick, probably one of the best ones i've ever seen. Getting end game gear is really hard and makes you work a lot for it which is pretty much fun cuz you always have something to work for... Lots of events, updates and new stuff added monthly...Nests are based on mechanics not only hack and slash and stuff like that, so if you want to do a high level nest you need to learn the bosses (attack patterns, mechanics which activate on a set timing or when the boss hp bar decreases)  to be able to dodge. Also team work is essential. You can't really do one high level nest alone, well you can but u have to be really good geared and know all the mechanics and evade pretty much all of them but that will also take a lot of time.There are lots of fun peoples in-game and most of them are social and helpful, so you can make a lots of friends in game and be able to get a party for nests easily. So i really recommend this game if you're looking for something where u can socialize, make friends and have lots of fun defeating bosses and stuff aiming for end game gear ^^			"

												After trying this game out for a bit, I have decided to write a review.Dragon Nest is an instance based RPG. The graphics are outdated but still tolerable.Where this game really shines is the fighting. The attacks are completely over the top and nicely animated. There's big explosions, fire, poison and all the stuff you need. Just awesome. The characters are gender locked and customization is not really a thing, but I don't mind that at all. Some quests are a bit tedious (talk to x, talk to y, talk to z), but the action easilly outweighs them. If you like to (or have to) play alone, you can still get pretty far - I've recently reached level 60 basically all by myself. So, overall I'd give this game a solid 8/10 and I definitely recommend it.			"

												There should be a ""mitigated"" button between yes and no. Good things first : the game is fun to play. The action based gameplay is really fun, simple and complete. But there's a lot of things that aren't good.. I've never seen a running animation that failed in any game. The character seems to float left and right while running straight forward. There is missing PNJs sometimes, some speak english and some speak korean, some things aren't translated (in french version).. But I still recommend it, as there's stuff to do, players to fight with, etc. And most of all, it doesn't need a war machine PC to run perfectly smooth. If you got a low spec PC and like anime style MMORPGs, this is the game you're looking for. If you're looking for a similar gameplay with better graphical quality and a little more difficulty, take a look at C9.			"

												This game is amazing; they don't lie to you when they say fast-paced action! In this game you have so much to do, and so much to explore! This game is overwhelmingly good for RPG-type gamers and gamers that want to waste some time. Leveling in this is very, but VERY slow, but that's what makes it a extremely long playthrough. And I MEAN long. Every now and then you have to buy new equipment because even though your skill does matter, you'll always need better gear. This game has alot of replayability and a character personalizarion that's almost as big as TF2's cosmetic system.The part that really got me nuts was when I had to get better gear from nests. If you don't know what a nest is, you'll know in your playthrough. The first nest (Minotaur) is actually quite easy for most people, but every other nest is very hard when you have the priveous nest's gear. Tecnically, this isn't really a bad thing, it makes the game not so easy but challenging wich makes it even better. I don't play this game for competion purposes, but you might. If you want, simply max out your character in every way possible and then go battle other players. The guild system in this game is quite good, the dialog is--- okay let's be honest here, people are only going to read mostly half of the game's dialog, just to know the game's story. There are HUNDREDS of side quests you can do to get better gear and money, wich make the game have even more replayability. Also there are dozens of ways to make your character.The things I was most annoyed at is that you can't trade mounts, almost every pair of wings, pets or anything that's in the ""AC"" tab of your inventory, and that you have to buy a scroll to reset your skillz. Like, if you create a character, but then you become tired of it and go and create another character, you can only give that character your gear and your money, but you can't give pets! I know that there's a gift option in the store but what if I already have a pet? I can't give it to my other character.But anything other than that, it's still a very, Very, VERY good game and I'm sure you too will have a great time playing this game. Just don't make the nest that is near your level meta, and you'll be fine.			"

												Game is quite good i liked the gameplay and skill system but. it is realy anoying when you are in quest and battleing a boss and the game decides to crash on you or give errors, so that is a big no no for me, i was still only lvl 4 so i just deleted the game as i dont want to stress myself with game crashes during boss fights or who knows what important quest im on so because of that i realy dont recomend this game at all. a game shouldnt crash like this at least not at this stage of the game. hopefully the devs will fix it. i might try it again in a year or so if it still exists till then			"

												I can't say that I didn't like RPG's, I mean I did, I found Final Fantasy REALLY annoying and I would have never thought I would change my mind with this type of game.It reminds you of skyrim, cause of it's ""open-world"" and the ability to level up, blacksmith, casts spells among others.Oh I had the greatest of memories with my friends here and sadly I can't get them back, cause they got bored of this game (the reason i'll never know why).I'm not very good at reviewing games let alone PLAYING them, but enjoying it is what I do best, and I guess other gamers do too.I can't give specific reasons to why I love this game cause i'm far from completing it. Let's say that holding a giant♥♥♥♥♥sword and bashing the ground and kill the enemies in one hit is the most hilarious thing ever in this game.That's it, have fun with this game. If you don't like this genre, it's never too late to try.And oh, just cause someone says ""It's bad"" doesn't mean that it'll ruin your experience with the game.			"

PvP is best i've seen in a long time and all classes have a unique twist to them, as well as sub-classes such as the swordsman and the mercenary for the warrior. The only down side is that to upgrade equipment past level 6 without fear of them breaking, you need to pay for a certain ingredient with real money, but thats what you get with a F2P game.			"

												I've searched through dozens of MMORPG's trying to find something at least a little interesting!Luckily some of my friends told me about this game, so I could spend some time with it - and it is really fun!There is no need to pay to win, if you want to spend your money you're still able to buy fancy dresses and hats!You get pretty much anything you need to have fun for free by just playing.The combat system is the most interesting thing about this game and pretty much it's core; after all everything is divided into dungeons and restricted areas, unfortunately.It is fast paced and built to fight through hordes of enemies quickly, which also works on lower difficulties.Though there also is a lot of oddly translated text in side quests and the story and much running around, you can definetly have fun with it, so check it out!

												Fun and intense, true free fighting Dragon Nest is one of my favorite MMO's that are free to play. Its diverse fighting is one of the best little features in the game. Anime style graphics make this game look great. When your fighting you will definatley feel like you are breaking the earth. Only setbacks of this game is it is gender locked and that there isnt very much character customization. Sooner or later though NA (North America) will get more classes such as the Assassin which is Dragon Nests' biggest project at the minute. The Assassin is only available in its birth place, Korea, and is based on what his name is, an assassin. Very good game, despite those bad features the game looks great and is very fun and addicting.			"

												I have only one advice. The community is Guild oriented. That means if you expect to complete something difficult with a raid/party, you have to choose a strong guild otherwise you'll end stuck at level cap doing stupid stuff. Personally, i had to destroy some guilds in order to fit in their closed stable-endgame-party, but hey, i got what i wanted. Well all of the above is possible only if you are so skilled they are forced to let you in, even if this means they have to break-up relationships with old friends or w/e			"

												This isn't a fantastic game. It has a myraid of flaws, but the combat is fun and intuitive and that is what holds the game up, at least for me; it's one of those games that isn't note worthy or technically impressive but is still fun to play - IF, you enjoy the combat. If you decide that you don't like the combat, then stop playing. In my opinion, this game is only worth playing because of it's combat system.			"

												Played this game with a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop and worked alright until I got into the more intensive dungeons and then gave up. After building my Gaming Rig I've begun to enjoy this game again and with the new Avenger class it's just amazing.If you're into grindy MMO's, this is definitely the one for you. The combat system is very well done imo as in you need to actually use skill as well as utilise you abilities for the best combat performance and DPS.There's a lot of foreign people on this game but it is a Europian game so that's to be expected (took me a while to find an English speaking person but that's like 1 downside).

												pros:+ you can run it solo+ anime style+ pretty animations+ nice costumes+ good combat mechanics+ freeCons:- party oriented with small size (4)- linear- low endgame content- cash costume op- low social content/ interaction Well... well.. well... it´s a nice mmorpg BUT, very linear and party oriented. Dispite been a mmo you almost run by yourself in this game, playing solo maps and quest. It´s something in this ""party oriented"" game that bothers me you can interact only with your party outside of the city.The party size is other major point, only 4 members, unless your attempting special dungeons (6~8 members).But its free Yay, and cute and funny... a nice game with some concept flaws for its genre.

												great game . almost dying but still worth playing . i have so many hours in this game and i still have alot of fun with this game ^^ ... but steam needs to fix this laucher . and the game needs more events to keep the game alive , gamewise the game is amazing u get to max lvl fast and u have lots of classes and character but when u reach max lvl u want to do those end game Nests and they are so hard for new players and if u dont have a good gear u cant even find a party . so fun game but u need friends or u need to get strong from alot of grinding because this game is not forgiven for new players . but i love this game and i will play it until is closes but keep in mind hard game and alot better with friends, and very low population. but give it a try u will love it :D			"

From what i remember the game was good, if you can get through the signup process (and cherry haven't mucked the game up since taking over) it is worth a look, HOWEVER I strongly suggest you go to the website and try to make and link your new account BEFORE you try to download (no sense in wasting time downloading if you can't get an account working) I am therefore marking this game as no for now, if the game play is as god as i remember though that could change quickly.*edit*well taht was a total bust, despite the message that this games launcher has been fixed and now works with steam...it doesnt, at least not for me oh and it tried to install an adware onto my computer (though i suspect when avg killed this it took out some of the game files too which may be why the game wont run) if i could change my review to a double thumbs down i would try going direct to the website if you still want to try this game DO NOT download it here.

												Totally recommend it, the gameplay and the story are sick...The game is pretty much easy at the beginning and gets harder as you level up and unlock new features. Up to level 50 it should be pretty much easy if u gear yourself to decent (epic set +6) cost around 10-20 gold(set materials in trading house) if you buy it or you can do the nests for the sets :) there are quite a lot of helpfull players on the server which will carry you in nests ^^.After level 50 the gameplay pretty much gets harder. When you hit level 80 you will probably need to work as a team with other players to complete daily quests for being able to get gear and stuff cuz the dungeons will have to be made on abyss/chaos difficulty which is pretty hard for ungeared players. The game has a lot of features and the combat system is sick, probably one of the best ones i've ever seen. Getting end game gear is really hard and makes you work a lot for it which is pretty much fun cuz you always have something to work for... Lots of events, updates and new stuff added monthly...Nests are based on mechanics not only hack and slash and stuff like that, so if you want to do a high level nest you need to learn the bosses (attack patterns, mechanics which activate on a set timing or when the boss hp bar decreases)  to be able to dodge. Also team work is essential. You can't really do one high level nest alone, well you can but u have to be really good geared and know all the mechanics and evade pretty much all of them but that will also take a lot of time.There are lots of fun peoples in-game and most of them are social and helpful, so you can make a lots of friends in game and be able to get a party for nests easily. So i really recommend this game if you're looking for something where u can socialize, make friends and have lots of fun defeating bosses and stuff aiming for end game gear ^^			"

												well ""Dragon Nest"" were should we started?I've been playing this game before it's come out on steam when I was about 15, 17 now.well this game is amazing the creators of this game just showed us that graphics don't really matterwhat thay haved created with that kind of graphics. they showed me that eny kind of graphic is beautiful.Stroy line well I don't want to spoiled enything so I will just say for F2P this game has some decent storyto tell.good:-graphics 6/10-Story Line  7/10-Co-op 5/10 co-op used to be good actually 10/10 but with latest update or aleast I think it happend in latest update every character start of with different quest. So if you wanna experineced that again will only experience that again if you and your friend create same class witch is kind of stupid cause we alawys liked to play with different characters.Bad:Well you used to choose from very begining with difficult you wanna mission to play now when you new you can onlu play on medium which is basically easy for me & my friend we put 3hrs to this week and we did't die once-game difficulty balancing 3/10and I think is the only bad think about it right now because I didn't play this game for while if theres eny thinkl I find I will update this review.-game 17/40 but it's great experinced & I will recommend this game			"

												After trying this game out for a bit, I have decided to write a review.Dragon Nest is an instance based RPG. The graphics are outdated but still tolerable.Where this game really shines is the fighting. The attacks are completely over the top and nicely animated. There's big explosions, fire, poison and all the stuff you need. Just awesome. The characters are gender locked and customization is not really a thing, but I don't mind that at all. Some quests are a bit tedious (talk to x, talk to y, talk to z), but the action easilly outweighs them. If you like to (or have to) play alone, you can still get pretty far - I've recently reached level 60 basically all by myself. So, overall I'd give this game a solid 8/10 and I definitely recommend it.			"

												I play this game quite often, and i really enjoy it. But recently I stopped and asked myself why i like it so muchYou know how in any MMO you have to grind like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by killing monsters one by one? Well here you grind like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ killing Dozens of enemies at the same time. That's why i love it.The only downside is the dungeon are always laid out the same way, so when grinding you litterally kill dozens of monsters the same way everytime, they pop up out of the same place everytime.Also i don't quite like most of the bosses, well i had nothing against that until the amazing Manticore fight where you actually have to do stuff to survive and not simple spam your skills until it dies.Overall good game, the graphics might hurt your eyes a little, but hey, people still play Florensia soooo			"

												Some comments say pay 2 win and in all honesty thats a lie!Dragon nest takes back to the roots of how the class system once was if you remember games such as ragnarok you know what I'm talking about.Dragon nest while being in the grindy side offering so much time to get to the next level in which you will find repetitive boring, but for those of you looking for a challenge when it comes to dungeons you've come to the right place.In Dragon nest as you progress you will find Dungeons called NEST and in these NEST everything changes you will need to find a team filled with skilled people along with the best equipment of that level unless your that ONE guy who thinks he can solo everything into the highest difficulty be my guest.Back to pay 2 win: NO what you find in the shop is merely aesthetics which do give you a tiny bit of advantage in stats however to balance this you can get these with in game events as well for free just play!So should you play Dragon Nest: Meh!

												This game is fun, really fun.There are 7 playable classes, (Warrior, Archer, Assassin, Cleric, Tinkerer, Kali and Sorceress), each one leading to 2 subclasses that lead to another 2 subsubclasses. Each class is unique and powerful in its own way, it's fun to play as every single character, by default you can't have up to 12 characters so you have a lot of options.The anime like visuals may not be up to date but suit the game very well and the animations look gorgeous and detailed, frame-by-frame. The textures aren't very good, they look like ```` most of the times.The abilities are the best part, every time you use one it feels like you are actually the one doing the ability, the sound and animations do their job very well.This isn't a open world kill monsters MMO, instead the monsters are in dungeons. The dungeons have a number of levels, and in last level there is a boss (duh), after beating the boss you get a reward depending on the difficulty chosen and a grade showing how much you suck.The Nests are like, mega dungeons, where it's best to have a party with you and you get really good rewards at the end of the Nest. You can only do one Nest a certain number of times per week, I don't like that.The story is skipable, I personally don't read it, the voice acting is garbage, but the funny kind of garbage.The PvP is amazing, it really is, if you fight someone your level you will see what I mean, I do not recommend fighting someone that is 5 or more levels above you, it may be frustrating, and only go PvP at level 15. The bad thing about PvP is that they change the stats, cooldowns and cost of abilities from PvE, wich isn't a bad thing, but it's kind of bleh, you strongest ability that does 10.000 damage only does 3.000 damage now. But it's balance stuff, so don't worry. The updates are slow, and for them to compensate that, they make Events, they may add new mini-levels, temporary raids or seasonal stuff. Besides that they just add costumes that you need to buy with money (update.png). I really hope they add new updates soon, this has a level 70 cap, but other servers, like the korean ones, have a level 80 cap and a new class. We will need to wait a while for that to reach Europe ;_;.  Just to finish it off, those people saying ''Dis p2w u can't pley dis >lel'' are very wrong. You can play this without wasting a single cent, you just need to work hard to get to that point, and also have some luck :3. You can get money items/costumes from the trading house that people sell, and also from events.  The last very important thing is that you shouldn't quit the game before reaching level 24. At level 24 is where you get the good stuff, your first official set and it is also the point where you should be moving to the next city, where you will see if you really want to quit or not, because of the new dungeons, nests and npcs. If you are still doubting the game and you made it to level 24, just play untill you can do the 2nd nest, then your decision should be final. But to those idiots saying ''Well I reached level 13 and this game is garbage...'' '' Oh! I reached level 20 and this sux!!1'', let me say that you are a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot. I recommend playing with friends, or getting a guild, the community here is very friendly and you may find many friends here, like I did.This review does say a lot of good things, but the game has its flaws, some may even quit because of the art style, or even the voice acting. Note this, the game isn't perfect, I said what I really loved about it and what people should be looking to get.			"

												I really loved this game. I would call it ""My first love"". After time passed, the game went through mayor changes, and after a few updates, the game wasn't what I loved anymore.Just as I fell in love with it, I'd like someone else to do so too!			"

												The creating an account part is as hard as cracking the code for Japanese Captcha for a game like PSO2 if not harder....----------------------If you can get past the horrific account creation and the broken launcher this game isn't bad it is actually a lot of fun.As other people have states don't take it to seriously just sit back and enjoy it.Play it with a friend and just have a generally good time.As far as gameplay goes there is a lot of depht put into customization, Specifically gatherable equipment.You can upgrade gear to +something something as seen in many Jap~ MMO's.You can have many skills and all can be used and I myself prefer to use the controller.Combat is fluid and makes you feel awesome, It is quite breath taking once you get further into the game.The controller support is pretty good although navigating through multiple menu's is best done with the mouse.... Weird :') Normally it is the other way around :')So again if you happen to be into this sort of thing, And you can get past the account registration... Which actually isn't hard... But rather frustrating....Then give this game a shot it is a blast to play.			"

												pros:+ you can run it solo+ anime style+ pretty animations+ nice costumes+ good combat mechanics+ freeCons:- party oriented with small size (4)- linear- low endgame content- cash costume op- low social content/ interaction Well... well.. well... it´s a nice mmorpg BUT, very linear and party oriented. Dispite been a mmo you almost run by yourself in this game, playing solo maps and quest. It´s something in this ""party oriented"" game that bothers me you can interact only with your party outside of the city.The party size is other major point, only 4 members, unless your attempting special dungeons (6~8 members).But its free Yay, and cute and funny... a nice game with some concept flaws for its genre.

												Yet another change.. As much♥♥♥♥♥♥as I gave CC last time, they are making a tiny bit of effort to make dneu better.. Popularity is coming back to some extent but unless you're looking for a slow moving game, I'd hold off on dneu for now.Oh and to all of you who think you have to put your actual details like pin, address etc. to bind a cherry account to a dn account.. Stop being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. Just put ""none"" or something and it'll be accepted. I'm pretty sure by law they have to do it.. I'm not sure if Singapore Law dictates that but if it does, just follow the damn thing by putting ""none"" in the sensitive info boxes			"

												If you can get into the game, yes the sign up system is a bit buggy, it's actually a good game. Though I do agree that cherry has made some issues, logging in, etc. But also the fact that alot of players like to level through the game and do quests, but when cherry took ownership of the game everyones characters were set to level 80.
