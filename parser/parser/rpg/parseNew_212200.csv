												The game's good, but pretty rough on people that choose not to spend any money. Some tips:1.) Finish the first Saga and get a free Pegasus pet. It has an aoe summon attack that cures poison.2.) Make a human first and that way you'll get a free elf and giant from talking to the elf and giant leaders and aligning with them (you can change alignment once per day).3.) Events usually give you cash shop items so be sure to bank in on those.			"

												My name is Trigger, of the Ruairi server.  I'm well known in the community, even across servers, for effectively codifying the proper use of Mabinogi's Magic skill set with a comprehensive guide that underwent many, many revisions over the years (and which is still referenced and quoted to this day).  I played for over six years and sank countless thousands of dollars into the game.  Mabinogi is my most-played video game of all time by a nigh-incomprehensibly-large margin (just not on the Steam version, which will explain the lack of hours logged here).  I've shrugged off changes that have made similarly-tenured players quit.  And as a relatively respected player whose advice carried significant weight with newbies and old-timers alike, I have one thing to say. Do not play Mabinogi. Mabinogi's combat was originally, at its core, a rock-paper-scissors system.  Normal melee strikes are deflected by the Defense skill.  Defense can be broken with Smash.  Smash is not as fast as normal melee and will always be trumped by it.  This, combined with many different enemy AI patterns, required players to be able to read the enemy's movements well in advance and react with appropriate timing, because all attacks carry some degree of stun and enough consecutive attacks will knock a player backward.  In the original release and for some time thereafter, tanking was completely non-viable because player health was vastly outclassed by enemy damage potential, requiring every combatant to be adept at reading and reacting to enemy movements and encouraging the then-commonly-espoused battle philosophy of ""don't get hit"". In the early game, this system is still mostly apparent and functions as intended.  But a number of problems have cropped up over the years that make the game's overall combat functionality less strategic and as a result less unique (and if you've not played Mabinogi, yes, its original combat system literally has not been replicated anywhere else, despite its brilliance).  I will attempt to outline what I view as the most egregious of these problems below. Power creep is part of Mabinogi's story.  There is an in-universe justification for the player's rise to near-godlike power, although I won't spoil it on the off chance you disregard my advice and play this game anyway.  But despite power creep actually having a treasured position in the lore (and despite its being a damn good plot point), it has still negatively impacted the game in more ways than one.  Nearly every subsequent flaw I list is in some way related to power creep. The difficulty curve is a joke.  The combat system underwent an overhaul back in the summer of 2012, which you may read my at-the-time opinion of here[www.purifierunit.com].  It was an inherently good update, and I thought it would force Nexon to consider their poor handling of the difficulty curve more seriously.  Sadly, they've done nothing but exacerbate the problem.  More and more skills keep getting added to the game with absolutely no substantial increases in content breadth or depth to match.  Since almost all skills grant permanent stats when upgraded, and since many skill sets rely on the same stats as other sets (allowing indirect upgrading of already-maxed skills), and since there are so many skills now, there will come a point at which a player is no longer challenged by anything the game has to offer.  In a game whose combat was originally defined by strategy and skill, and wherein a properly skilled player could take out a far bigger and stronger monster with ease, ""difficulty"" is now represented by monsters with bigger health bars and higher damage output, and virtually all of them can be laughed at upon reaching a certain power threshold, completely removing all strategy requirements from combat and reducing it to mindless grinding.Enemy AI is a hopeless shambles.  It served its purpose well in the original release -- for instance, bears and goblins were both notorious for using deceptive tactics to bait players into reacting incorrectly.  Most enemies can handle melee, magic, and archery attacks with relatively good reaction patterns.  Attacking an enemy more than once with a bolt spell or a normal bow shot, for instance, will almost always cause the enemy to charge at you directly, reducing the effectiveness of spamming, especially in the cases of fast and ultra-fast monsters.  Once alchemy was added to the game, the original AI crumbled and never recovered.  Enemies have never once had their behavior patterns updated to handle new offensive techniques or new skill sets.  They are still operating on their original AI, all of them.  If you start out focusing on melee skills initially, you'll receive a decent portion of the game's original challenge level.  If you choose something like Puppetry or Dual Guns, you will completely outsmart the AI merely by virtue of the weapons and skills you'll be using.  It isn't a total slam dunk, as most skills start out with low damage and the AoEs all start with relatively small areas of effect, but the enemy AI will still have no idea how to handle them. The early game has been nerfed to hell and back.  This was unfortunately necessary, as the constant piling on of more and more skill sets left newcomers hopelessly behind the curve of the experienced players (and since this game has no level cap and no class system, there was no way for them to ever catch up).  The changes to leveling speed have aided everyone, though, not just the newbies, and thus the problem remains unsolved, having merely shifted in a certain direction.  Newcomers can attain a decent power level much more easily and with far less fuss than they could originally, but by the same token the old dogs can effortlessly blaze through new skill sets in a week or less, leaving anyone beyond a certain point utterly content-starved.  The endgame has been killed thanks to poor design choices focused on making the early game easier. In case you didn't catch this in one of the previous paragraphs, there are far too many skills in the game now.  Most of the new skill sets have been added for very little reason other than bigger, badder, flashier attacks (going hand-in-hand with the attempt to shift the game's demographic from fantasy fans over to lovers of everything vapid, flashy, and hollow), and as already mentioned, enemies simply can't handle the newer stuff.  Anything designed with previous content in mind is always outclassed by the next batch of skills.-----That about wraps up my deconstruction of Mabinogi's many current flaws, all of which contributed to my leaving the game and none of which have thus far been addressed.  I don't expect any of them to ever be addressed, either, because Nexon's Korean development team basically just develops for the Korean users, and the players on the North American servers get whatever Korea gets.  If you play this game, know that you have absolutely no voice in the game's future direction.  You will exist merely as a cash grab for Nexon. There are other major gripes I could have laid at Nexon's feet here, including their horrendously overpriced cash shop, their habit of releasing a bundle of new outfits in gachapon and calling it a ""content update"", their poor community management, their childish and completely amateur banning practices[www.purifierunit.com] (of which the linked blog post is hardly the only example), and much more besides.  I tolerated all of the above for over six years because Mabinogi was once a giant among MMORPGs, schooling the rest with unique mechanics and satisfying gameplay.  It's now a shadow of its former self, and it does not deserve your attention.			"

												although it says i have only 425 hours in this game that is far from the truth, i found this game on its website and then i went and found it on steam. Now although i love this game i will try to not be bias. so to begin, i will start the pros and then go to the consPROS:1.this game is massive, as of Thursday October 30, 2014. there is 16 generation story lines . then there is two episodic story lines , saga and iria, with iria on its 4th episode.2. you can do almost anything in this game. I always ask people "" tell me what you'd like to do in the game."" and I normally get stuff like ""trading, clothing crafting, black-smithing "" and those exist , probably one of the only things you cant do is open pvp. you have to invite the person to a pvp battle and they have to accept it.3. the graphic style, now this is both a pro and a con, i will talk about the pro part here, the good thing about the graphics is that they are rather simple. now not to say the game looks boring. the areas you can go are diverse and interesting. a winter mountain range full of giants, or a desert in a constant sandstorm with elves. or do you go to the lands of tera and tailliann, the front of the fight in g94. skill ""tree"". this game offer a interesting system for skills. it is free flowing. everything if offered to you at the start, there are a few that you have to unlock( like meteor, blizzard, and hydra transformation) or you have to be good in one skill set to unlock hidden skills. the beauty of the system is that you can always be doing stuff. i have one character that is level 2500 total and i have barely mastered any skill sets.5. Combat, now combat is interesting because it truly matters on what skill set you choose to adopt. a battle mage or spell sword are going to fight completely differently from an archer or puppeteer. but the most basic combat is like a real time rock paper scissors where some skills trump others but are trumped by others. this makes you require a bit of strategy but also quick moves6. events, there are always really fun and entertaining events, just last summer their was a big staged event that ended with an SAO eventCons.1. camera control, now this is the biggest complaint I've gotten from people, the camera is not the easiest to control. you ether have to right click, or move you mouse to the side of the screen. now yes in combat it can be a bit annoying. but it just takes a getting used to, it takes a bit of pre-planning2.graphics, like i said this is a pro and a con, now if you like the style and since its low in the graphics you can easily play it on low end pcs, but if you have a better one or don't like the art style, it will definitely be a turn off.3. the openness, now i know a lot of people like the openness but most likely as a newbie will get so caught up will all the possible skills he will want to try to use all of them and be weaker than they need to fight enemies of there level. it takes a bit of discipline to focus on just one class.4. pay-to-winness, now this may not be noticed by most people but since it is a free to play, there has to be some form of transactions. some of those include cool pets (like dragons) or gachapon that hold special items. these are used to get special items, these items can then be sold for gold to other players to make a profit. yes this does happen, yes there are people who have a whole quick slot full of dragons. but because of those people, everything can be acquired in game for gold. now it might annoy people that this is true but pay to win is not entirely true. it just depends what your term for ""winning"" i can honestly say I've probably spent 500+ on this game and that might sound crazy but for how many hours I've clocked i think its worth it			"

												Dude I used to love this game, and so did so many others. Like I had some of the happiest times in my life through this game; I started this game with 2 of my real life friends, found an amazingly fun guild, and made an amazing friend (though I'm sadly no longer in contact with them) as well as other great friends. Now, sorry for this giant rant, hopefully you read it. I seriously loved this game.I went and replayed the game about a year ago, hoping to relive my happy times, and to some extent I did, but to a very small extent. I went and played on the Mari server, the once biggest server in the game. I found ALOT of fun through Martial Arts (it was boxing basically), and it was flashy, and the enemy AI (The AI used to be really smart and worked very well, but it was never upgraded to combat skills like Alchemy and Dual Guns, so it became really stupid when you used these skills) was still functional using it, but besides that, everything that made the game crumbled. There was so many damn skills, each one rendering older skills useless. Magic to a point and archery more or less were replaced with Alchemy. Then puppeting came and replaced Alchemy's biggest selling point; having a golem. Then came Dual Guns to completely replace archery (like so few people used archery, why not go and fix it?). The last thing that was added before I gave up on the game was Ninjistu, and I just gave up. It was so silly and extremely anime (yes the game's korean, but it had taste and a really nice art style; not just full fledge kawaii desu Naruto rip-off crap), and I can only imagine this replaced another skill class.That wasn't the only thing that made me leave, there's a bit more. I could deal with a load of crap skills as long as I had some fun ones, but each new event was complete crap. Back in the old days events were so much freakin fun! Like there was a skiing event, a cotton candy sheep event, and a water balloon party event! (just to list a few). Aw man these were all great and alot of fun to me! But when I returned, it was just non-stop re-hashing of the dragon boating event (where you go down a river in a raft, fight some mobs, get a reward, rinse and repeat) and the Tara event (a japanese style event with a dart throwing mini game and a test-your-strength hammer game.) The Tara event was fun when it released, but it REALLY overstayed its welcome through it being rehashed every other week.The economy also went to complete crap. Current day rare items would cost about 10 million+. You wanted a guitar? Better be rich, because you're gonna have to dish out about 20 million. Not only that, all old rare items went to complete commodity. Like I had a rare Leprechaun outfit that was super rare when it first came out; I was one of the maybe 20-ish people who had it on Mari, but when I rejoind they were barely even worth 100k (this is basically normal spending money in player markets). Due to Nexon just re-hashing old content, extremely rare items became to the point of being only uncommon to just somewhat rare. I used to be so proud of alot of my rare clothing; since alot of the game was about fashion and being distinct and being yourself, I felt proud walking about with some really cool n rare clothes, but now that satisfaction I had was quickly diminished. Lastly what made me give up on the game was how lonesome and empty the servers became and how crap the once thriving and amazing community became. I played in about 2009 to 2010, and when I did, I could basically just walk up to anybody and either join in their conversation or start one, and befriend them. It wouldn't be some weird akward conversation either, people would just talk and be friends with eachother. The game used to be a huge party. You could walk down dunbarton (basically the games main town) on almost any server and find naked people running about PvPing one another, and then just down the road find a group of people participating in Elves vs. Giants war. It was great! But when I went back, the place was completely lonely. Nobody talked, there were barely any live guilds anymore, most guilds being dead, and nobody Pvp'd anymore. For the most part, the game was just deserted. Sorry about this huge dang rant man. I just really love this game. It was really important to me. I made alot of great friends through the game, some that I'm sadly no longer in contact with, but I still have the fond memories. This game was amazing in every aspect in its prime; great combat, great community, and great events; there was something to do for everyone, and the game truly was a fantasy life. You wanna go and do something? Go do it! You can! Everything felt important and was satisfying. Even just fishing and gathering potatoes and such was fun, because you always had a friend while doing it or just someone to talk to, and a reason to doing so. I'm always hoping to find another amazing game like this; a game that'd make me excited to wake up and see what's going on, and just a sheer joy to play. I keep hearing about FF:XIV, and here's hoping that I'll be able to enjoy it like mabinogi. Once again, sorry for this giant rant; I'm just super passionate about this game. This game meant alot to me.			"

												An Anime-stlyed mmorpg, point and click style.Be what you want and do what you want.While I may not have many hours here on steam, I mainly played the game prior to having it on steam.I would recommend this game to any of my friends, and if Tarlach server is joined - then I'll be willing to help people out.Mabinogi is an MMORPG, with the following unique features:- CombatNow, you may think ""Combat, every game has that"".While this is true, Mabinogi incorporates many forms of combat, such as:* Martial Arts* Ninja Skills* Magic* Alchemy* Puppeteer* Melee* Range* Gunslinger* Lancer / Knight* and more!!- QuestsThe Quests is Mabinogi vary from doing something as simple as gathering items, to something as crafty as making an item. They even go to as complicated as following a series of mini-quests and dungeons in order to complete the Quest.- HousingNow, the ""Housing"" in Mabinogi is not your usual home-like area.The ""Homestead"" that you own from level 10 onwards, is actually different for everyone depending on their tastes. There are three locations to choose - Human area which is Grasslands, the Elven area which is a Desert, and finally the Giant area which is Snow.While you get to choose your location, when you level your Homestead up (yes, it has levels!) - you can then build more unique structures. Everyone's Homestead will be different.- RacesThere are three Races to choose from, upon your initial character creation.Human. Giant. Elf.Each Race will of course have bonuses and different specialties.For example - Humans are the only ones who can use two swords.Elves are extremely amazing Archers, while the Giants have more Health and Strength, and more powerful 2-handed weapons.- Marriage & FamilyYes, in Mabinogi there is a Marriage system.You can get Married to the opposite Gender, or even the same Gender!As for Family - If you get Married, you can create a Family.A Family can consist of yourself and your partner, and up to 6 Children.There is a Family Rule that can be set (example: No dropping items). It will reeset every week I believe, and it will show a counter for those who break the rule.- Pets / MountsYou can obtain Pets and Mounts in-game.Most of the better ones are from the Cash Shop (NX / Karma Koin).Some pets are simply just that - Pets. Both a Pet and a Mount will have inventory for you to store your items. Mounts on the other hand, can be land-based, or have the ability to fly as well.- Rebirthing""Rebirth"" is something unique this game offers. You can Rebirth every so often up to level 1000 Total, from there onwards you will actually need to Rebirth every week or purchase character cards to use to Rebirth.Rebirthing a character will give you the option to change your character appearance, level, age and even gender!- LevelsThere are two variants of levels in Mabinogi.Your level, which is basically your ""combat"" level. Everything you do will earn you exp, which will contribute to this level.There is also Exploration levels. To level this up, you basically have to do Exploration Quests, or go out into the Wilds in Iria (Elves and Giant area), and search for unique hidden objects and items, which you can trade in for EXP and Gold.To level up anything, you will need AP which can be granted upon every level up.The higher your ranks go in a skill, the more AP it will require to level up.- RanksSkill ranks go from the following order (worst to best)NoviceFEDCBA987654321 - Max RankAnd now, to my favourite part...- Non-Combat SkillsNon-Combat Skills are extremely variable.Want to spend your time Cooking tasty treats? Become a Chef!Feel like crafting your own Clothes? Become a Tailor!Want to laze around and spend your time Fishing? Then do so!There are many non-combat skills to find and master.The one unique one which makes Mabinogi different than other games, is simply my favourite;Musical Instruments & Composing.You can re-create songs inside of Mabinogi.Want to play Skyrim Theme? Done.Want to play Game of Thrones theme tune? Done.Pokemon Battle Theme? Done.If you wish to give it a go and enjoy playing, feel free to play with us.Server: TarlachMy in-game name: Alyxa			"

												*Edited and revised for further clarity and information*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------An interesting mmorpg. Having played many mmorpgs before, mabinogi is a favorite due to its dynamic combat system. There are infinite battle combo possibilities as the gameplay involves fast paced action with a unique do-it-yourself strategy allowing almost limitless freedom to choose how you play. While the game features talents (i.e warrior) like most mmorpg's, it doesn't limit what you can and can't do allowing you to choose what skills from any tab (melee, magic...etc) you want to train giving a really unique gameplay individual to the player rather than restriction, emphasizing complete freedom in how you like to play. Another appealing factor for mabinogi is the anime-style graphics rather than the traditional realism based graphics that give the game a relaxed outlook rather than a serious tone.Having played this game for several years and watching it change and grow i can point out a few perspectives on its pro's and cons:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pro's:- Freedom to play however you want, as whoever you want to be with no linear path set out for you to take. There are no penalties for doing what you want or neglecting to do certain things if you don't want to. This allows a player to choose what to do, whether it be fighting and training, crafting and trading, or even just socializing.- Active and alive community full of players from veterans to newbies; never a dull moment no matter where you go (Alexina is one of the most active servers in-game and Dunbarton is one of the most active towns in-game).- Immersive and involving storyline that spans out several chapters, events, and in-game years that pit you in the midst of the struggle as one of the ""milletians"" involved in the conflict between the gods and various factions in Erinn.- Constant updates and add-ons to the game; whether in the form of a new storyline chapter or the many year-round events, mabinogi always keeps you coming back for something new or even something old that is a favorite.Con's:- Cash Shop: Some items you might want to acquire (like pets, high grade items or bags for example) are only obtainable through the cash shop, which is if you don't mind the $5-$10 price, and are otherwise difficult to obtain (trading in-game gold for NX codes to get a pet ***not recommended there are many scammers*** or paying millions of in-game gold for a bag or high stat items).- Skills: Some advanced level skills require immense effort or dedication to obtain (in the form of grinding certain monsters or dungeons to receive quest items or completion points related to the skill you are trying to obtain. Alternatively these skills can be easily obtained by rebirthing into one of the Aces Hero talents, however that also requires direct NX payment or Pons purchased with NX.- Outdated graphics (however still quaint): Mabinogi was coded and released in an earlier decade where archblade and warframe level graphics were not available. There have been many updates and upgrades since then but no real way to modernize the graphics without creating an entirely new mabinogi game. However the graphics still hold their charm if you enjoy anime-style art.- Clash of personalities: unfortunately like many online games, mabinogi suffers from groups or individual players who are destructive rather than constructive in the community. This ranges from simple acts of annoyance or ""trolling"" of the general player-base to out-right scamming and arrogant im-better-than-you attitudes. Thankfully these groups of players are easily identifiable and are only a small part of the much larger community of helpful, respectful, and kind players.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would say, try it out. If you like it, then enjoy it. If you don't then that's alright too. Don't knock it till you try it. It's one of the very few unique mmo's that are out there that feel different from generic mainstream mmo's.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~for those who are T.L.D.R -> Great fun game with a few issues here and there like any other game (nothing is perfect), if you give it a chance try it out you might like it.

												[Edit 7/4/2014] Review has been slightly revised prior to the ""New Beginnings"" patch. The most noteworthy bits of information: Rebirths are now free and can be performed every day for newbies, and weekly for experienced players, and beginner benefits now extend till level 1000, thus making the game even better since all players don't have a huge waiting time to continue playing the game.---Original---As someone who spent way more than 3,000 hours on this game, I feel as I have seen everything this game has to offer, and I still enjoy coming back to it. Although Mabinogi is a free-to-play game, don't let that label drive you away from trying this unique game out.Mabinogi is about the story of a random Milletian (You) who was sent to the world of Erinn, one thing leads to another and you end up helping to save the world from one of many dangers. The graphics are cell-shaded and provide an anime-like feeling, the background and world is inspired from Celtic Mythology and fantasy titles, and for what it is, realistic looking graphics wouldn't make it look better. I should mention that the game has minimal optimization settings since it's a title from around 2003, but most computers should be able to run it and handle it smoothly.The core gameplay of Mabinogi is the freedom to develop your Milletian to be anything and everything. Most of the skill sets are well balanced and influence other skill sets or play styles, giving players the ability to fight as stylish or brute-like as they please while being efficient and reliant on the player's actual observatory skill and reaction time. Skills aren't trained by just leveling up, you have to actually use them in specific ways to be able to train them, and at the end of that, you can advance them to a higher rank, which rewards more damage output and stat increases that carry over no matter what you decide to do next. Combat is also not just clicking and letting your character do all the work. Player input helps determine how the combat pans out, and goes in deeper than just mashing hotkeys. The game is tailored by ""If something is bigger, than it is stronger than it as well."" It's also a challenge to fend off more than two enemies at once at first glance. Once a player gets in the swing of things and understands what skills are effective and when, then yes it's easier to play and interpret what an enemy will do next, and what skills they should look into advancing.If you are already pretty beefy, there are a plethera of life skills which people can work on that reward the ability to produce products of the sort and permanent stat bonuses. Most people only do this on their downtime or till after the point where they feel they are strong enough for what they run.The other core function is the ability to ""Rebirth."" This resets your current player and exploration level to 1, giving you the chance to level-up as easily as you did back when you were level 1. Which in turn, gives you more AP to spend on skills. This means there are no character level caps, and you can keep going to learn new abilities and skill sets. Rebirths are available for free every day for players under total level 1,000, or every 6 days for players over that 1,000 level mark. Some people dedicate a rebirth and pool all the AP they recieve in that timeframe towards a certain skill to get that mastered.Mabinogi has a social aspect as well. A large chunk of players in Mabinogi are either anime fans or people who just want to hang out, and most of these people actually play the game as well. There are various sub-groups people are ""put in"" based on what they do (PvPers kill each other, Fashionogi stand around flaunting their looks, Vendors/Sellers sell things or advertise, etc.) and a lot of people connect more based off that ""system."" The forums on the site are also well active, with many people who communicate amongst one another, including with some of the more well-known Nexon employees or community managers.The premium shop has it's fair share of criticism since Mabinogi is a free-to-play game. However, in my personal experience, It's not that often where I will say something isn't worth the money. Ranging in the premium shops are pets and mounts which serve as inventory space or... obviously mounts to ride or fly from place-to-place with, the premium services (which isn't required to play the game in it's entirety), and various other goodies. It boils down to if you believe it's a reasonable price for the item and if you are willing to pay for it. Along with this, I'll get criticism for saying this as well, but Nexon is pretty generous with their premium content. A lot of events and even some in-game quests reward players with premium content, double training / AP events, and more content to fondle with.Mabinogi is a truly unique game overflowing with content that you can choose to aspire to or not. When you sit down to the game and play it for the first short while, you will feel accomplished just starting out and getting the hang of combat and gathering. With that feeling, you'll want to get better at the game and pursue playing it more. At first, it's a steep learning curve, but don't let that concern you. With practice, experience, and time, you will be able to take on anything, and you will fully enjoy this game.If you have any questions regarding features or anything else in the game, Feel free to note my in-game character, Aradefaktare of Alexina server.

												I can only begin to try to describe the countless good and bad things about this game, but the bad far outweigh any of the good. Detailed other reasons are noted after the 3 short lists of key factors. Note: I have clocked in several thousand hours over the 5+ years I have played this; before it was available on steam naturally.) Looking back, it was not worth any of the time or money invested.The Good: Unique and interesting way of ""leveling up"" as your power is based on skill levels rather than actual levels (a unique system known as rebirthing is  the fastest way to gain the points to rank up skills).  Combat system Is complex and strategic, with MANY skills to choose from, you can even mix ""skill classes"" such as melee with supplemental magic attacks  An interesting story and lore with several hundred of hours of quests (not including non-story questing).  They now offer 2 basic pets (with no inventory), a thoroughbred and an eagle (flying pet)The Bad: Traveling can be a pain, pets can only be used a limited time per day, and are still needed to truly get around in longer dungeons and the map To be effective at solo play you need SEVERAL pets, a mount, several combat pets (like dragons or nine-tailed fox), a cloud to heal your HP and wounds (they are also useful fighters; and with their healing nature can save you alot of inventory)  Inventory is a seroius pain to deal with, even carrying basic things you always want on you will need a pet or two (ex. basic tools for most ""life skills""; tradeskills)The Worst:  Has had major hacker issues, (characters being corrupted beyond restoration, deletion, etc.) The game is horribly optimized, even with the highest end of computers you can and will experience issues with the frames per second in some areas.  The community is atrocious, you can find it difficult to even get people to help you with basic dailies (easiest difficulty), yet you will be surrounded with 30+ people just sitting in the area idling around and walking about.  Inventory is such a hassle to deal with in general; you will find yourself using up all your bank space, inventory bags, equipment bags (if/when you can afford them), and many pets to hold the things you need for dungeons and crafting.  Over time your favorite items will be damaged from even the best blacksmith/tailor, and when that happens it loses some of its max durability (naturally they make you fork over $6 USD for each ""save"" per item).  Everything you do and will want will be heavily directing you to the cash shop  Customer Support is deplorable Addition of the new ""free"" pets: Thanks to some feedback I remembered those existed. However do not think its that great you now get some basic free pets for travel. The choices they picked for these ""beginner"" pets are among the worst in combat, they do not have access to their pet inventory feature (so they cannot hold anything, not even things to heal/mend you; mending is EXTREMELY important, as when you are alone, since pets can mend you as you sit down for full effectiveness of each bandage.The Atrocity of the cash shop: I can only begin to try to explain why the cash shop is just among the worst. To save your item's max durability you must repeatedly spend ~$6 USD each time (each item i believe.) This is just unacceptable because you should not be influenced to spend money for something that is such a basic need of the game.Pets cost between $2.90 and ~$18 ... naturally the more expensive ones are among the only really useful ones, as their cost seems to go hand in hand with how useful they will be in both function, and combat. These are important because of any combination combat, travel, healing, gathering, and inventory functions.They just go too far tying the cash shop directly into the game,enchantments are among the worst.  Want a good enchantment?  Well enchantments themselves ... when they fail it destroys the item (at higher enchant ranks) lower ranks cost you max durability, and to even get to using higher level enchantments you not only have to do a series of enchantments (going from low ranking to higher ranking enchantment scrolls; you also need the enchantment skill level high enough to be able to do them and up your % of success ... to save an item from a failed enchantment you must purchase an absurdly expensive $$ thing to stop that from happenning. Character slot availability also suffers, you only have 1 character per account ... luckily they have ""assistant"" cards given to those humans who choose a race (elves or giants) to ally with (not sure if this still holds true). After that you have to spend $10+ per character for new ""character cards.""). But this is a problem as it limits the different combat playstyles you can try (as levling up different skills do not always compliment eachother, and they all add to ""CP"" Combat Power, which makes leveling up skills substantially harder in the long run. There is also the fact that for some end game skills you will have to buy a special ""ace"" card of ~$6 to !$20 just to keep your progression going. One example being the Merlin talent. Depending how much you spend is how much it gives you to start with. Problem with ""Life skills"" (crafting):  You will find that it has lots of chances of failure, as if to pad and drag out the experience, some may argue its part of the joy, but I find no join in having an A rank herbalism and struggling to pick even base herbs (the most basic, literally), or blood herbs (for HP potions). Why it costs mana and having to rank up how much mana you have just to batch make potions is stupid (especially for warriors). tailoring and blacksmithing can also feel like a game of chance. And mining is only done within certain dungeons! (only 1 of which being good), There is also of course the obvious fact that Life skills take INSANE amounts of time, grinding, and effort to rank up (literally many hundreds of hours.) Enchanting (although in the magic tab) is the worst of life skill (because of pading and cash-shop tie ins), as you use it to enchant armors/weapons, and of course when those fail ... it destroys the item ... worse yet those scrolls EXPIRE after just a mere 24~48 hours. Basically in laymans terms enchanting is one of the hardest and most drawn out skills to rank up. And the most costly to items, as depending on the enchantment rank (the scroll imbued with the enchantment), you will lose 0~8 max durability to your item ... most have about 10 to 14. Why is this such a big deal? because you will be needing those good enchantments for good gear, especially for later in the game, you will quickly find that the risks for going up only get higher and higher too. Imbalneces between races:  You will notice that humans are the only race that can effectively use pretty much any combat style or skill sets ... yet they are also the slowest movement speeds (which has both travel and combat implications). Races are all different, they rank up skills at different rates and costs, but also have different stats per rank. For example a giant has better melee skills (costs less to rank up too), than humans, and elves are the weakest at melee (to a point where investing into it is a bad idea for a playstyle.) Giving each race a lean is good, but making them drastic as it is, is terrible. Especially since finding gear for any race other than humans is VERY difficult (gear outside of starting and basic gear.)The combat and story itself are interesting and wonderful (respectively), but Nexon has just butchered the game into something to milk money from, and the sad part is that its been that way for as long as I remember. So this game is definitely not worth your time, or your money.			"

												Played this game for 8 years. No other online game has got into me more than this one.I would not recommend it for its combat, its p2w cash-shop or its overall content.But if you want a game to talk with people and to live adventures.You won't find a more social game anywhere.The skill system is interessing, the Story has its up and downs, the music is amazing and the npc are memorable.But what really give mabinogi its charm is how there is no ''zones''.No matter your lvl, everyone hang out in the same cities.You meet and talk with the same people every day. You get to know your server.This game was for me exactly what everyone is hoping of a future SAO mmo.I've meet people here that I wish I still had contact with, friends that I would never see in the outside world.Fox, dem0, Waui, Tropacat, Blackcat9, Ravendor, Reginar, Atokadz, Kittywolf, Goodrich, Alexane, Rena24, Kiosk, Lucy, Abbie, xcrushx, Zyrus... and so.. so many more that I can't even remember the names... I knew each of them. Some more than others. Shared joy and sadness with them. Laugther and rage. Tales and Music. Advices and questions.I took a few breaks. Changed servers a few times.After 7 years I've lost friends. Somes hated me and stoped talking.. Others simply quit the game. I was seeing new faces more and more. And then It hit me. Mabi was not the same for me.I don't know if I will ever be returning, but I feel sad every time I think about these memories.It may only be a game, but the time we spent in it was real.Elevenn of Alexina 2008-2013Firelinks of Tarlach 2012-20xx			"

												I am ghoultrooper of Alexina lvl 11k. I've been with Mabinogi for a long time playing on and off since 2008. i wanted to input my views of the game so here we go:The Pros~+ Unique Rock paper Scissor style of combat *+ Infinity customization in coloring anything from the soles of your shoes and outfits to the hilts of your weapons+ Newbie Friendly Beginner System ( helps you somewhat catchup to the current players )+ Unique Rebirth Leveling up System which has no LvL Cap ( main reason i haven't ever permanently quit )+ Events come by frequently and so do content updates every few months+ Many Crafting Skills+ Abundant amounts of daily minigames/quests that you can do+ Nice Story+ Playerbase is Mostly Friendly.The Cons...- Nexon.- Has a somewhat steep learning curve.- Reforges are from cash shop only but are obtainable from other players via in game gold.-* The unique combat system slowly dies off as you gain High Dmg. you will end up using just the efficient clearing methods ( although that can be said for most of any game ) -~ Inventory can become an Issue if you're a hoarder like i am. Pets are almost a must buy utility BUT you are able to buy pets from other players with gold also so... -in my honest opinion, at least half of the NA server is lazy af. so many  people just afk and don't run anything ( missions, dungeons, etc. ) - 7  channels but everyone clogs up on channel 1 and channel 2 through 7 are almost like ghost towns zzzz....- Durability.Neutral**- Despite what many people say, Nothing in Mabinogi is actually Pay2Win. Everything is obtainable through grind or luck. things in the Cash Shop are more of Convenience/ Fashion Items.Conclusion.I find the game fun to play every now and then but once you've got your gear and many of the skills done there isn't much left to do. the Dye customizations are great! I Recomend any new players to find a nice guild or just a nice veteran player in general to help guide you through. guilds are generally very nice in Mabi overall and will help you often.			"

												Mabinogi is the best yet the worst game out there in the MMORPG genre. There are quite literally infinite possibilities in gameplay, but most people spend their days online with friends. The social aspect of this game is honestly it's best trait; Mabinogi holds home to one of the most friendly and active communities I've ever seen. Sure, it sounds great and all, but it's a serious time consumer. Personally, as a gamer, I want to play as many games as I can for story, gameplay, etc. Mabinogi offers this, but it never stops and consumes all of your time and money. I will never regret playing Mabinogi; it was the best time of my life, but I am also happy with leaving the game after five years of service with the hated and loved Nexon Inc.			"

												Mabinogi is one of the greatest MMORPGs out there. Very Unique and Very Fun.I was recommended this game by a friend and I told him that I wasn't very impressed by its 'looks'. Sure enough, I at least gave it a try...and From that point onwards, I have never stopped playing it. That was about a year or so ago. That's how amazing this game is! Mabinogi is one of those games that doesn't require you to complete EVERY SINGLE quest and task; it's all completely up to you to make the choices and do what YOU want to do.One of the main things that makes this game so unique and fun is its combat and leveling system. The combat in this game requires more stragetic choices and as well as good timing of skills and attacks to do some damage against foes, rather than just pressing the skills button to do some extra damage. Also, the leveling is very different to other games. There's quite a lot to explain but to put it shortly: There's no level cap. You can just keep on leveling.Another thing is the gaming community. I promise you, that this game has one of the most friendliest communities I've ever played with and that is what keeps me playing. Simply just asking for a little assistance and someone, who hears it, would usually come by and help you out.Last main thing is the story and updates. The story of mabinogi is very unique and it is separated into 'Generations'. Each generation can pose quite a challenge and usually isn't something you can just rush through. The story overall is a very interesting one with its twists and turns. Each update is always something that I can look forward to as each one usually has some sort of event with it, giving players the chance to win great and useful prizes.There are alot of other great things that I can say about this game, as well as a few minor problems. But overall, this game ROCKS! and I recommend it 100%!			"

												Mabinogi is a play as you want game. There is really not much you can't do in this game as far as picking how you want your character to look and feel. Outside of few race locked skills there is no ability you can't learn and master in this game if given enough time. Even for people who like to do nothing more than craft items and gear all day the game is set up not only to let you do that, but you to also level up while doing it. In this game what level you are doesn't really mater as much as the rank of the skills you use and how well you can use them. Even a person who is a total newbie can manage to kill bosses for as long as they got the timing of their skills right, know when you block and/or dodge, know what weapons work best for what you are doing. There is no such things as making a bad roll when creating or playing your character as part of the systems as well as story is ""rebirthing"". Letting to restart your character from lvl 1 and/or change your looks again. When rebirthing only your level is reset and you keep all your gear and skills. So over many life times you can build up your skills only focusing on what you want.This updates often with events that are fun for new and old players alike. And the main story of the game is well thoughtout and deep. Besides being fun and well as challenging. People who are aware of real world history and mythology will notice and spot a lot of the hidden meaning behide a number of the people, places, and things within the game.			"

												As one of the few people still playing Mabinogi, I've noticed that the game has been on a rapid decline since when I first began playing. This, of course, can be attributed to many things, but I feel like what stands out the most is how little attention has been payed towards bettering the game. Within the past year, the changes have been minimal and largely focused on adding new gimicks and events. Customization is only an option when you have Pon, the premium currency, and opportunities to get this are far and few in between. The community is slowly dying out, and nowadays you'll only find 5-6 players in one area.     With this in mind, I continue to hold out hope that Mabinogi will make a comeback, as I really liked the rebirth feature and have yet to experience all that they have to offer. If only attempts were made to smooth out the edges of the game and perhaps introduce new features that actually matter to the gamer, it wouldn't be too far a stretch for Mabinogi to gain back what its lost as time has passed.     However, as Mabinogi is now, I just don't feel like this game is really worth playing. I'll still keep waiting for that game-changing update, though, if it ever arrives.			"

												I'd like to go on record now and say that I've put more hours in to this game than anything else I've ever played. I started back when I was in seventh grade and this was my game of choice every afternoon and weekend through all of high school. I quit playing Mabinogi seriously about the time I graduated, then went back some time later. I've put way too many hours in to this game and I've watched it grow from the early stages to the game it is now. Now, the I'll break down the game's biggest weaknesses as best I can and let you decide if you want to play this game or not.RNG repairs: It's present in nearly every game at this point, but it's really bad in Mabinogi. If you have a sword with 12/12 durability and you take it down to 0/12 with lots of use, you can lose your maximum durability on a repair. Your 12/12 can become an 11/11 or even a 9/9. You can pour money and time in to upgrading and perfecting your weapon, getting the perfect enchants on it, and even spamming pay to win elements on it to make it perfect, but eventually you'll be sitting on a great weapon with 0/0 durability and no way at all to use it. RNG upgrades: Once you fully manage to upgrade your weapon of choice, you have a special upgrade you can preform that either increases the damage or your critical attack damage. This upgrade comes in multiple ""steps"" starting from step 1 and going up to 6 (I believe step 7 was added as of the last time I played, but I have no experience with this.)Step 1 to 2 will have a 50% success rate and cost about 100k per attempt. If you fail at getting to step 2, your step 1 weapon will go back to 0 and there's nothing you can do about it but try again. Every success takes you up a grade, every fail takes you down one. You could have a step 4 weapon and it can drop down to step 0 simply by failing what feel like coin flips repeatedly, each failure making your weapon weaker and costng you money to do so. As if that's not bad enough, there's a final 6th step you can reach from step 5 that has a 40% chance of success, and your weapon will DISAPPEAR if it fails. What.. The.. ♥♥♥♥.... Imagine spending a bunch of money on a weapon, a bunch of money carefully repairing it, a bunch of money upgrading it, you finally manage to get it to step 5 then POOF! All gone, try again. Seriously, whoever thought this was a good idea needs ♥♥♥♥ing fired.In-game economy: It's nonexistant. Seriously. Any item you can craft or get as a drop will also appear in the cash shop in the form of a gachapon or a set you can buy. Want to recover a little of your max durability on a weapon? wait for it to appear in the cash shop. Need more space or want to get around faster? Buy a pet in the cash shop. You can't spend money to get out of doing leveling, but you can buy weapons that will make your leveling experience feel like the easiest thing you've ever done. The only reason to raise any crafting skills in the game is for the added stat bonuses. PvP: What PvP? There are multiple systems in the game for it, but there's absolutely no reason to do any of them. Players can do way too much damage and don't have anywhere near enough health to deal with it. Experienced players with enough money invested in reforges (see next point) can kill somebody (in a duel where you're supposed to do 1% of your original damage) in about ten seconds. There's no point at all.Reforges: Oh boy, here we go. This, for me, was the nail in the coffin. This is what made me quit the game after so many years of hard work and commitment. Reforges are cash shop exclusives (with very very few exceptions through events.) A normal reforge will cost about $1.30 and gives you one roll at your gear. It doesn't change the gear's existing stats in any way, but it does add a new stat down to the bottom. Once you put a stat on your item, you can buy another to change it. I've seriously gone through $140 just trying to get the ONE stat I wanted on a single piece of gear. Not two specific stats, just one. You spend and you spend and you spend, throw your entire pay checks at Nexon just for a chance to maaaaaaybe get what you want. It got to the point I wouldn't duel anybody who used reforges, and I stand by my decision. You're literally buying your damage in the cash shop. Reforge scaling: To put it in perspective, I could take the next few years and fully max out a character. Every skill. Maxed. No exceptions. I could then enchant all my gear and upgrade it perfectly to maximize my damage. The best bow with the best roll and the best upgrades, all the way to step 6.. Where to go from there? Nowhere.. Pretty good, pretty good... Now take a newbie with three month's experience and give him the same bow, let him max out just his archery skills (no added dex from other skill trees) and spam it with reforges till you get decent damage rolls. 10/10 times that newbie will do more damage every time with every shot than that expert. This game doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about your play time or your effort, money will always win. In conclusion: There's tons more I could talk about, but I don't want to keep writing this any longer. This isn't recent, I haven't played this game in at least eight months. This is the resentment I feel towards Mabinogi and their publisher from how terrible their game was all that time ago, and I am positive it hasn't gotten any better. They add new 'harder' content but they increase the cap on the damage players can do as well, so there's really no point. Even if Mabinogi has some of the most entertaining progression I've ever played, you'll outlevel the progression and it turns in to a slow tedious grind on easy mobs and artificial difficulty thrown at you to make you feel challenged. Don't waste any time or money on this outdated trainwreck, your bank will thank me later.			"

Mabinogi: The Fantasy/Anime Life (This hits the character limit, by the way.  Scroll to the bottom for the important summary/spoiler.)Mabinogi is my number one favorite game of all time.  I'm not one for number ratings so base your opinions on my biased ones. This is the first time I've actually devoted time to seriously reviewing something, so feel free to leave me any feedback or whatever.  I'll try not to spoil anything.  Here we go.The GraphicsThis game is simultaneously great and terrible with graphics.  Earlier content is standard, not too detailed or appealing, and may be all around bland.  In my potentially terrible and possibly uneducated opinion, the game would leave more to be desired considering it's an anime inspired game.AND YET...Due to the lack of amazing cutting edge graphics, you can generally use your imagination to fill in the amazing level of detail.  Also, considering how long ago the game was made, and how easy the game is to run (even if it doesn't run perfectly or crashes or whatever), I could let it slide.  My toaster didn't short out, so it's a win in my book.The StoriesThis one is tricky.  The game has a storyline based on many of it's major updates and they're labeled as generations.  The writing and detail in most of the game's dialogue and story pretty much can be summed up in the word ""anime"" with you being the star of it all.  My only complaint would have to be that some of the later generations seemed to be excuses for adding in newer skills to the game.  Some things wouldn't add up to me while playing, and the skills you get being the ace in the hole to beat that certain end generation boss, or that last unexplained solution or clutch thing someone does to save the day inexplicably just screams ""anime.""  The latest generation (Generation 20 as of this review) is the perfect example. But hey!   You can turn into a god of immense power with dope skills that do massive damage for no reason halfway through the story.   So there's that.The Gameplay (This is my favorite part. Try to stay with me on this one, of skim/skip it to save time.)Playing Mabinogi is like playing a smaller, and simpler version of World of Warcraft.  You run around this world, hit things to level up, run dungeons for loot and experience as per any other MMO of the like.But Mabinogi is kind of special.  Let's talk about skills first.  Skills are grouped together and collectively add experience to a ""talent"" system, and upon leveling up, adds stats to your character.  Every skill has a rank, which is increased by ability points earned from leveling up, and range from Novice->F->A->9->1, with 1 being the highest. With the transition from novice to F and A to 9 being instantaneous, that's a total of 16 ranks per skill.  Some combat skills works in a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors fiasco(smash beats defense, counterattack beats smash, etc), while some works based on properly timing your skills to deal, avoid, and spread damage (looking at you, Gunslinger and Ninja).  The non-combat skills and talents vary from the standard MMO cookie cutter stuff (Fishing, Cooking, Adventure, etc) to somewhat unique things that only playing the game could explain (Battle/Construct Alchemy, Wine Making, Carpentry, etc).  The skills in the game are well complimented by the leveling system.  On a side note, skills have certain requirements that have to be met to gain experience.  The system feels broken/improperly scaled for most skills, but that's just an opinion. Anyway, this system allows you to take on literally anything at any time, which lets you make that perfect MMO/Anime character you've always dreamed of.Let me also add briefly that the game has a hidden stat called combat power that guages your power based on how much you've leveled certain skills.  Moving on...Leveling up in Mabinogi is very different from other games due to the unlimited level cap for CUMULATIVE levels.Here's the kicker though: you can only reach a maximum CURRENT level  of 200.To clarify, this means that as you play the game, you can play up to level 200 before you can't level up anymore (which is hard, tedious, and dumb), so to make playing the game fun again, you get to REBIRTH, which sets your character back to level 1, and lets you grind back up again for more ability points. Rebirthing works on a 24 hour limit up until cumulative level 1000, and afterwards works on a time frame of 1 week.  Fortunately, you can reallocate every single point you get before you get there, which means at level 999, you can talk to an NPC who can set all of your skills back to novice and give you a chance to remake yourself entirely if you're not happy with the results.  By the time you hit 1000, though, you'll be strong enough to handle majority of the game, if you haven't already, with the only main downside being that the game scales with you on some fronts in terms of enemy difficulty, which can lead to many instances of artificial difficulty.Nexon is very good at creating that, by the way.  Speaking of bad things, time for the opinionated negatives.This all ties together, actually.  Playing the game,  you level up as you normally would, putting your points into your skills like you want to, and being the awesome character you want to be.  Then you get to that dungeon or boss you can't beat that hits you like a truck because you're stuck in the asphalt in the center of the road.  No problem.  Go train your skills and get better at the game.  By the time you get better though, you reach a level that ups the game difficulty, which makes the dungeon harder, and on top of that, the skills get harder to train, because the monsters that used to be ""boss"" level to you are only ""powerful"" now due to increased combat power, so you can't fulfill skill requirements as easily or as fast.  See where I'm going with this?  The game mechanics can unknowingly make the game harder on you the stronger you get.  This isn't a common problem due to Nexon locking the difficulty on most missions via updates, as well as making most missions ""partyable"", but when it hits you it hurts.  Phew...moving on.Still with me?  Hey!  Wake up! We're almost done, I swear.Everything else.Here are all the other things that are not or may not be worthy of mentioning for one reason or another.  I'll try to keep these in a few sentences or less.The community isn't very large, as the game has been around for a long time and other games have surfaced. Most of the time you'll get complaints of people going AFK all the time, or higher lvl people treating weaker players with less respect, but that's every MMO at this point.  Let's be honest.  It doesn't always happen either.  A good amount of the community is actually pretty cool for the most part, but keep in mind, you don't need people to play the game.  It's only recommended, and there are few instances where teamwork is necessary, especially if you already know what you're doing.  The game almost always has an in game event going on, but they're all usually uneventful.  Ironic eh?  They're usually simple, easy, or uninteresting due to one of several factors.  The events that get the most attention generally involve some fancy or amazing skill, action, item, etc that everyone wants to claim, or sell for the profit.In SummaryMabinogi has captivated me.  It showed me what I wanted in this genre of video game, and even though it's far from perfect, I love it to death.  I wouldn't recommend playing it though...it hasn't aged well unfortunately...

												Mabinogi and I have this love-hate relationship, but whenever i think back to all crazy adventures i've had, and the people ive met, I can't help but smile. Mabinogi is a game that always left me wanting more. After playing it for a while i would crave and action game and leave it, then I might crave a stragegy game and leave it, I might leave it to focus on my school work or my part-time job. But every time, without fail, I always come back. In a since, i guess mabinogi was my home. It raised me, and though I would sometimes wonder off, I always knew where my home was.Thank you Mabi, for the 7 years.			"

												Mabinogi is an interesting little mmo that is about you the player being sucked in your computer and ending up in a world called Erinn. You are called a milletian by the worlds people and as you discover more things about yourself, the story unfolds into this tragic and sad conflict of many different people. This is the main focus of the story and I will say that its decent. It will keep you interested but the story mission lines are short. Though at this point in the games life, there are tons to complete. And speedrunning even at low level will only take a couple of hours to finish.Now on to the Mechanics. Mabinogis combat is simple yet hard to master. It is a lot like rock paper scissors and every skill has its counter. Smash> Defense Counter>smash. Theres many different skills to choose from and you will always feel unique from other people. The skill leveling on the other hand is somewhat similar to UO (Ultima Online). You have to use the skill repeatedly to rank it up. For example Smash would require you to kill 10 enemies using smash, smash a critical on ten enemies to rank from rank B to A. These are just examples, but the number of times you would have to repeat using this skill increases to hundreds or even thousands depending on the skill. Some rank themeselves up and you won't even notice it as you play. Other skills will require you to go out of your way just to train them and could take hours of your time just doing that. Life skills like blacksmithing could take you about a month to do if that was what you had spent your time on for a whole month. To rank skills though, you need Ability points. Ap (for short) is given by leveling. I level up to 80 per rebirth for example. After you hit say 80, you will want to rebirth. Rebirthing removes the stats you gained from levels but you keep your stats that you gained from skills. You can only rebirth once a week but you can rebirth for free every three weeks. If you would like to buy a rebirth once a week its about 10 bucks.This is actually one of my problems with mabi is that its very grindy. Its a very unique game with huge amounts of character customization. Just very grindy. The questing is totally fine with not much grind at all. Some of the story quests mix it up with puzzles. Its just the actual building of your character. If you are looking for an mmo thats different and you can waste a ton of time on but stay engaged, then this is the game for you. Game has quite a bit of sandbox features such as housing and character customization with tons of outfits and skills to mix in. There is even farming. If you are looking for a game that will not waste your time but still give you a great experience then this may not be what you are looking for. Mabinogi has to much grind hidden under those colorful cartoony graphics to justify playing only 1 hour a day. You can very well play the game for free without spending a dime, but you will want to. They offer limited edition pets constantly, Various limited edition clothes, and rebirths to make your life easier. So all in its a very unique mmo and its hard to lie and say that it isnt. But playing an mmo like this or wow really worth it to you? After all of the fun is said and done and you have seen everything it will turn into a job. Every mmo that is currently out in america will have you grinding for hours. Even guild wars 2 has grind at the end. So is it worth it to you?			"

												Mabinogi is a game based off of the Celtic myths called Mabinogions. I don't know much about celtic mythology, but the game's icon is based off the celtic knot. The game is made by Koreans who are well-versed in the art of coding crack cocaine into video game form.  You look like an anime character from the PS2 era, doing mundane tasks to rank up how well you can sheer a sheep, or mix strawberry milk. Onto the gameplay,This game has no excuse to run at 15 fps at some places, being from the 2000s. If you can get past the horrible engine this game forces you to play on, you're in for some not very exciting gameplay. The game is based off of a rock-paper-scissor type combat (at least for the basic combat skills, this starts to matter less once you get more specialized skills) which would work well if the game didn't lag to ♥♥♥♥ing oblivion.I forgot to mention the lag. Depending on the day you play, time of day, position of the sun and moon, and if your oven's clock is synced to your microwave's clock, the game can lag terribly to unplayable.After 6 days (everyday if you are under a total level of 1000), you can rebirth and reset to level 1, but keep the progress you have made on any skills you were ranking up. This is a core aspect of the game. Optionally, you can use rebirth potions that you can buy with real life money (NX) to rebirth anytime. Eventually, you'll be level 80 after one day and have a whole 5 days to wait, wondering what the hell to do now. The game tries to keep you playing everyday with events, and opportunities to give you more ability points (what you use to rank up skills, these run out very fast). The community is absolutely awful, since it mainly attracts weeaboos, middle schoolers, weeaboo middle schoolers, edgy middle schoolers, edgy high schoolers, people from Gaia online, and actual adults who spend way too much money on a Japanese anime life simulator. All of the above will try to prove how much better than you they are by using the classic ""my damage is higher than yours"" reason. Although this doesn't really change the fact that you are both playing a Chinese timesink.One thing I do like about this game is it's NPC art. Not the graphics themselves, but the little portraits that appear when you talk to NPCs. Also there's cute waifus which is VERY nice. The music is ok, some pieces are actually pretty good. But one of the things that attracted me to this game originally was the fact that there are musical instruments in the game, and you can compose songs using MML (Music Macro Language). Eventually, everyone just ends up playing Naruto openings, Bleach openings, Mario, Pirates of the Caribbean, Zelda, Skyrim, Carameldansen, Power Rangers, and other songs you've heard to death. The skill ranking system goes from rank F - A, then from 9 - 1. Getting some skills to from rank F to rank 1 can take either a day, or a few months. You spend AP, or ability points, to rank up these skills. Some skills will take about 60 AP to get from rank 2 to rank 1, and that's not including all the other ranks before that. The main reason for rebirths is to get more AP for your skills, which to why you keep coming back to this Taiwanese basketweaving tutorial. The quests are ok, I guess.This game is ok, I guess. Play it if you have a few hundred-thousand hours to waste. It's easier with friends.  "

												I do apologize for my lack of game time. I played Mabinogi directly from Nexon before it was released on Steam. Though it seems I have almost no time on the game, I guarentee I've spent at least 150+ hours on the game.Now that that's out of the way...This is quite possibly one of the best, if not the best, MMORPGs that I've ever played. This game is far, FAR ahead of its time withs its massive variety of skills ranging from picking herbs to controlling puppets in combat, its INCREDIBLE organization of stats and abilities, its MASSIVE amount of customization and fashion (Hence the nickname ""Fashionogi"") and wonderful, active community.Unlike other MMORPGs, where you choose a class and typically sit on it, making it stronger, creating your own skill sets, etc. Mabinogi has the unique feature in which you can be ANY CLASS. You can do anything...eventually. The game starts out fast so a new player can master one of the classes (For instance, mastering the Warrior class) and then it slows down quite a bit to increase the challenge of the game, demanding a bit more attention and dedication from the player.Want to be a warrior? Sure. Want to be a mage? Sure.Want to be a ninja? Sure. Want to be a magical ninja warrior? Sure. It'll just take more time. However, power isn't everything. Tactics and pure skill can determine life or death as much as skills and raw power do in this game. Unlike most MMORPGs, where dungeons are scaled in a way that only players of a certain level or above can survive, Mabinogi changes the whole scene. Going to try and clear a very difficult dungeon at a lower level? A lower level player can do it, provided he or she has the skill and appropriate knowledge of the game mechanics. But is it going to be easy? Not in the least.Even skills that aren't combat related aren't useless in this game. As they level up, they provide increases for various stat points. No skill is totally useless, its all useful in some way whether the player uses the skill or not. The music is simply wonderful, and the ever updating content and events are always there to keep things interesting.My ONLY complaints in this game (And believe me, they were hard to find) is the occasional bug that comes with all MMOs and the fact that the combat system is a tad slower than I'd like it to be. Nexon is EXTREMELY lazy when it comes to updating the combat engine, though they are making tiny updates (emphasis on ""tiny"") that are working on changing this.But these flaws are insignificant and downright redundant in comparison to this game's virtues. My rating: 9.5/10.			"

												Mabinogi is not your typical rpg, with the class-less character customization and clothing color system, it's practically impossible to be ""just like"" another player. The game can get very challenging at times, and also has multiple storylines for you to follow. Overall, your experience in this very old anime-style game will be like no other.7 years, 3 accounts and $4,600.00 later, I am sadly an addict to this game. I can't seem to quit. My money just keeps turning into NX Credit.Yes, the game is a ""Free To Play"" title, but once you start throwing money at the game, you notice they make things so much easier for you, and then you want to just... throw more money at the game. This is not to say the game is ""Pay to win"", it's more like ""Pay for the better life"".Sadly, being over 7 years old (over 10 if you consider the original Korean release), this game isn't aging well. With poorly optimized visual techniques, and processor utilization, even the most powerful of computers will have a difficult time running the game in ""1080p 60fps maxed out"". The game itself is barely optimized for dual core processors, so anything higher than that doesn't make a noticeable difference.If you have yet to play this game, tread with caution. If you already played this game, then you are too late.*Edit*I would like to announce that as of September 1st of 2015, I have successfully quit the game.			"

												I've been playing this game since it was release to NA and have loved this game ever since. In fact I still very much love this game, but the population of the game is a different thing. People was once very active in doing other quest instead of just raids and such. Once I could ask for help and get a response in a matter of seconds from total strangers. I could also once go to a shadow mission area like terra and expect to see a plethera of parties looking for players. Also, I could trust people when it came to trading....Now everything has become to money hungry, everyone just sitting around doing nothing. Its all about how good your character looks or how much everyone sucks unlike you. You also have to worry about being scammed or getting someone who plans to screw you over in a mission. Most of the content has become more solo based unlike before where you would require to find friends to help you out and just plainly enjoy the game for its story. Now everything is handed too you and and people have just become mostly rotten. If you plan to play the game I say get your friends to play with you or find a guild thats still alive and running. Because if you want to experience the full game playing by yourself is impossible...			"

												Okay, I'm gonna go straight to the point here. I love the concept that this game has. I think the fact that you can rebirth and master multiple skills instead of being restricted to one class is really cool. Being a music teacher, I also love how you can compose music on here using actual music theory. The in-game music is pretty awesome as well. One thing I don't like is how buggy the game is. The pathwaying for the game seems pretty sloppy, as I occasionally find myself glitching in the same spot when I try to talk forward (especially through the narrow hallways in the dungeons). I also invited some friends to play the game, and it seems like most of them have problems when they try to launch it (these people also have very capable computers, so I wouldn't call it a systematic problem). Another thing that really bothers me is the pop-up tip windows. I try disabling them, but it doesn't seem to work. It's tediously annoying to have to deal with that appearing in the middle of my screen during a fight. Overall, I like this game. I think you'll enjoy it too, if you can work around the little annoying bugs and pop-up windows.			"

												Mabinogi, by definition, is the closest MMORPG to Sword Art Online ever created. Wether you acctuly like the anime or not, there is no doubt that Mabinogi closely resembles some of its elements. However, I whole heartedly say this, Mabinogi is not for everryone. Why you may ask? Well, simply but, Mabinogi is very, very, VERY grindy. If you want to have a half decent character, you need to grind. See, there are 2 ways to play Mabinogi. 1. You can play just to dork around and talk to some friends you convinced to play with you. 2. You can feel like a toatol badass when your character is so combatically stacked, that plowing through hoards of enemies with one quick swoop becomes incredibly entertaining. That' right folks, you want some fun out of this game? You gotta learn to fight, and fight like a pro. This is where Mabinoig is the most grindy. See there are multible classes (or talents). And each talent has its own weapons, and stats, and blah blah blah. But here's where the game is intresting, some talents work off the same stat, thus making it that if you did both classses, both would become stronger due to you training that stat. Here's an example for you: If you do Close Combat, which get's its power off of your strength stat, and you alos did Ninja, which also get's its power from the strength stat. Now both of these talents become stronger because they both work off the training of the strength stat. Some people will take this to the extream by taking many different talents that rely on strength, or intelligence, and train them up so that they can be powerful in a whole arsenal of classes. Now how do these classes work? Well remember how I said this game is kinda like Sword Art Online? Well basically each class has X amount of skills, and each skill can be trained and ranked up by using AP. Every skill can go from rank F to rank 9, and then rank 9 to rank 1. This obviously is where the game becomes very grindy. In order for your skillset to be half decent, your going to have to train that skillset a lot and earn lots of AP. However, that makes becomming a respectable warrior all the more rewarding. Mabinogi is honestly very addictive, it plays off its own grindiness, pulling you in and making you beg to bring your skill up just one more rank before bed. Basically if you give Mabinogi time, and take the time to learn the ropes, and find your way around (I would suggest using the Mabinogi wiki page) then you will find that Mabinogi is a really great game.

												Mabinogi was a lot of fun. Using 'was' because I played it for over 5 years and outgrew it already, but couldn't just leave without reviewing my experience. Let's start with the good stuff. -UniquenessThis game is old, and it was way ahead of its time. There were so many features other MMO's never even though about having. So much stuff to do. There's not even a level cap so you could just literally keep on playing this game until it died. Updates are frequent and have actual creative/interesting content.-CombatHow do I even begin to explain how amazing the combat in this game is. Sure it's point and click, but its deeper than the typical point and click game. You actually need to think about what you're doing instead of just spamming 1-9 skill keys like other similar MMO's do. -GraphicsFor a game from 2003(?) the graphics don't harm the experience. The anime style of the game still kept it refreshing. -StoryOh man, the story in this game.. All I can really say is that its confusing and doesn't flow together but its interesting at the least. The directors kept changing for this game and they never continued each story arc, they made their own instead. So why am I not recommending this game? Nexon. The name itself pretty much has a derogatory meaning in the world of MMO's -Horrible customer service-It's just another pay to win-free to play game.The community isnt that great either, it was good at first but then corrupted once cash items started becoming necessary to be good at this game; Such as reforges.Don't get me wrong.. I've spent hundreds of dollars on this game. Looking back at that.. it wasn't really worth it.  But if you can get past Nexon, for some odd reason. Then go ahead and try out Mabinogi. There weren't many MMO's to play back when I played this. The ones that did come out, never stood up to Mabinogi's features. Not to mention that I had a crappy computer, so this game was perfect for it. I grew up with this game and it'll hold always be special for me. But yeah, if you want a more modern version of Mabinogi, just wait until Peria Chronicles goes west. (if it ever does, but Nexon will probably bring it over)			"

												Pay no attention to my hours on record, I've been playing this game on and off via mabinogi launcher since 2008, before they switched to Steam. Honestly I have a love hate relationship with this game. It's addicting as hell and even though I hate so much about it I can never leave.  Skip to the bottom summary if you don't want a list of reasons for my love hate relationship.THE GOOD:There are things I love about this game that differentiates it from other games, things that I have never seen in any other game from all my years of gaming. The whole fasion system is AMAZINGGGGG (OMG I cannot express that enough) and for a girly-girl who loves video games at the same time, that's a total sell. Any other time I play a different video game I constantly complain about their lack of costume creativity. Being able to hoard 150+ outfits, AND dye them EXACTLY how I want with such a variety of colors is what makes me never want to leave Mabi. I'm 150% attached to every single one of my imaginary items. Also, I think this game has a really interesting story line, I know some people who even fan girl over it. I love a lot of the music (for those of you who actually listen to the game you're playing), and the fact that it's an anime based game is really appealling to me. In addition, this game is responsible for me having met the best friend I've ever had (including actual face to face friends), and I can see us being friends for a very long time, even forever perhaps if we do not loose touch being long distance and all.THE BAD: The reasons I hate mabi seem to be endless. Granted, their customer service is EASILY 200% better than it was even 3 years ago, it still isn't great. The game itself doesn't run very well, it lags A LOT and makes you want to throw your keyboard, punch a wall, or a person, etc.; even though I have one step below business class internet with a custom built compter that can handle games like AION, TERA, and FFXIV perfectly. The community (at least the Mari server) is GOD AWFUL. They are relentless when it comes to harrassment and even death threats if you♥♥♥♥♥♥off the wrong person who just so happens to be friends with ALL OF THE TROLLS in the merchant channel. They know exactly what buttons to push, things you wouldn't even imagine another human being, being capable of saying. Yet, Nexon has yet to care about any of it. There's also the times where one or a small group of person(s) decide to use an incredibly illegal hack to where the entire server crashes, and there's a rollback that causes you to loose really rare stuff. And does Nexon care and/or replace your items? Of course not, because they don't have any kind of tracking system like that of WOW (not that I've played, because it's hideous, but have heard about) where they can verify that you did indeed have said rare item, and now you want to cry your eyes out for a week because you lost your favorite item(s).!!!WARNING!!!:The whole free to pay thing, yeah not. PAY TO WIN, and have sexy outfits. Which I, like many Mabi players, cannot have enough of. My first 5 years of playing this game, I had kept every single one of my Nexon cards ever purchased at a gas station. Why? Idk maybe one day I had hoped if I spent enough money and could visualize it, I would stop giving them so much money. I had spent literally THOUSANDS$$$ of dollars on this game in that amount of time. After that, when I got my own bank card and started using that online, it only got worse. The prices are ALWAYS rising too. I just came back from a 6 month break and noticed that their outfit shopping bags, which WERE $6.50-$7.50, and are now at $9.90 each. And of COURSE you can't buy JUST one, no! Because their new outfit designs are always THAT appealing, GG Nexon. And don't even get me started on their gachapon system - it's such a scam! You would have to honestly spend hundreds of dollars in one sitting to get anything even remotely good. Maybe you're ok with that, or MAYBE you're one of the few who gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lucky and gets something worth 50m after spending 5 dollars. Lets be honest, that doesn't happen all that often. Although it seems to happen more to newer players than those who are veteran players, from what I've noticed myself and heard through other people. Why give a veteran something good if you already have them hooked on the game and spending money? Let's reel in the newer people to get them to spend more money in the future! Honestly if you're looking to find a game you love and stick with it, do yourself a favor and DO NOT play a ""Free to Play"" game such as this. Playing a sub game(typically $15/mo) usually includes everything you will ever really need. SUMMARY:Sexy outfits with a vast, neverending variety of fashion choices to which you can customize exactly(NEARLY all the time) to your liking=GOOD. If you like anime based games=GOOD. The company, the community, the functionality of the game itself, and of course, your forever empty wallet from too much Mabi addiction purchases when it comes time to pay for rent..and Idk...maybe buy food so you can eat? = BAAAAAAAAAADEven still, I'll never quit.

												I Would recommend this game to anyone looking for a mmo that really is like nothing else. I've met some people i plan to keep around for the rest of my life on it. but remember, it's called a ""fantasy life"" for a reason (sometimes drama and all). it can consume ALOT of time.One other thing to remember, this game doesn't hold your hand. everything i know about the game i had to find out for myself.*edit* at the bottem of this review i will do a hard break down of a single combat encounter.-----------------------------Pros? Litterally no level cap,Interesting combat (can be complicated), it's skill combo based, you need to act and react according to what you, AND your enemy is doing. spamming one skill will get you killed. unless your a playing range. Many classes, each with completely different play styles, and any skill can be used while under any ""talent"" as the game calls it, your talent only means your gain double xp for the skills under that talent, there is only race restrictions for some skills.Some of the combat talents are; close combat, mage, puppeteer, Alchemist (construct, and battle), Lance, bard  (mostly buffs only one offensive move), fighter, ninja, gunslinger etc.. theres alot to pick and choose from for combat There is many many things to do outside combat, there is alot of life skills, cooking, smithing, magic craft, etc.. the list goes on and alot of these the high end goods from these crafts can fetch a handsome price. and outside skills? there is treasure hunting on Iria, and different types of collection books to fill, such as types of food you've eaten, types fish caught, monsters you've hunted. Commerce is another thing, in which you take goods from one town and take them to another and hopefully sell for a higher price, which nets gold and ducats, ducats used to buy limited supply goods and more powerful versions of standard weapons.MANY MANY skills, (want to be a master of milking? how about hoeing? you can do that.)almost always 1 or more events happening,new stuff all the time,friendly crowd (depending on server, but over all amazing and you can usually find someone willing to help you at any time, the game is better when your friendly and make friends, just a tip.)more clothes and styles then you can shake a stick at, (all of which can be gotten with out spending a dime, though.. sometimes the dime would be ""cheaper"")great customization options (sometimes at the cost of money), interesting lore and story (if you can read) regular updates------------------------Cons?You can find yourself spending quite a bit of money for anything from pets, pon (for character features and homesteads), limited time clothes, character cards, and suchthe nice clothes, aren't cheap with ingame money. get use to it.combat can be complicated if your coming from the typical mindless button mashing mmo. with out spending money, there is only 2 free pets you get on start, a horse (without inventory), and a eagle mount (with out inventory). later you can get a Pegaus mount (with inventory) per character, but you have to go through a story line that can kick your butt with out the skill lvl for it. There is a biannual event where you can (after alot of work) get free pets with an sizable inventory, other then that, events where you get pets.. are rare.With out spending money, your basic character will look pretty bland and dull. (with one or two dollars though, it can be vastly improved.)Gachapons, can turn in to an addiction if u don't watch out.Lag, glitches and such happen, but are completely bareable._____________________Overall, it's an mmo i don't plan on leaving for a while, and i've hopped from most other mmo's out there, this one, is different and i love it. For me, the best part of the game, might not be the game, alot of it is the comunity._____________________COMBAT BREAK DOWN:ok i'ma try and be as simple as i can with this.. this games combat is.. for the most part very unqiemelee encounter:as your enter combat you open with SMASH (an opening hard hitting move used to 'smash' through defence)> the enemy after being smashed and taking 100-500% damage and being knocked back (human scale) will then use either defence, counter, or windmill, smash or simple basic attack back (each require different answers)            - for DEFENCE use smash again and knock enemy back again           - for COUNTER use use windmill and knock enemy back again           - for WINDMILL load defence and walk up and take reduced damage (like a 1) and then attack enemy with basic attack, or a skill of your liking, has to be instant load and knock enemy back.           - for a BASIC ATTACK you would want to use counter, which will negate damage, and deal damage to the enemy knocking them back again or you would use defence, which will greatly reduce damage and likely deal only 1 to you, but as a trade off, will alow you to freely attack the enemy how ever you like.            -for SMASH you want to use counter, smash negates defence, so counter is the best option, you can as well basic attack out of being smashed, counter will knock enemy back again.>when a enemy is knocked back there is a fallow up move, ASSAULT SLASH, which you will charge the enemy, and deal more damage ontop, but leave you close to the enemy with less reaction time, the move will do a small knock back.>Now if you attack the wrong way.-if you smash the counter, you will take your damage added to the enemy damage-if you basic attack the counter, you will take your damage added to the enemy damage-if your basic attack defence, you will be stunned and the emeny is free to attack you-if you windmill defence you will be stunned and the enemy will be free to attack you-if you counter defence nothing will happen till one of you changes your attack.-if you get close to the windmill, the enemy will deal damage to you, and knock you back-if you use counter with windmill, the enemy will attack you will windmill and negate counter-if you load defence for the smash you will take smash being knocked back-if you if you do nothing to any of these the enemy will attack you. derp.>now another thing, every skill have different amounts of cool down, so you WILL NOT be able to answer the same way to everything every time. you will be forced to answer in different ways.>there is ""ultimiate"" type of skills ""final hit"" is the big warroir one. >there is many, many modifiers ontop of all of this, armour, weapons, enemy armour, enemy stat modifiers. >there is multi-aggro enemies, which complicates this even farther.>there is far far more warroir skills that are avaible then what i've given examples of.

												I JUST LOVE IT HOW YOU GO INTO COMBAT AND THEN YOU GET HIT WITH MASSIVE SERVER LAG AND FIND YOURSELF DEAD ON THE FLOOR.10/10 Would die due to server lag again, thanks Nexon love knowing I can count on you! <3...But really, I'm gonna be writing a serious review here. I love this game so I'm recommending it, Mabinogi is a fun, casual game to pick up and play at your own leisure. Currently my main problem is the combat. Ever since I first started playing this game some six or seven years ago I've noticed one major thing; Nexon's server stability is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If you play this game with the idea that you're going to mainly be combat oriented, you're gonna have a bad time!Combat in this game is all about picking your battles wisely. Two key factors in combat is lag and targeting. I've already talked about lag so let's talk about targeting. Unless you're good at pointing your mouse in very specific places, you're gonna wanna hold ctrl to auto-target the nearest enemy to your mouse. Now, this isn't a bad thing... unless you're fighting a large boss monster. I'm in the beginner dungeon trying to target a giant red spider when his little buddies are nowhere near my mouse, yet I target them anyways and aggro unwanted enemies, thus getting myself killed.That aside, this game has a number of features that make for a great atmosphere. The soundtrack, for example is one of the best I've ever heard in a free-to-play MMORPG. Not only that but you have the ability to pick up an instrument, write your own music and then play said music. The only other game I've seen that implemented would be in LOTRO so this feature is a huge thumbs up in my books.Mabinogi offers a wide range of skills from combat to magic to simple gathering and crafting. Each skill has a rank and the more you work on the skills the more training it gets to the next rank. Before ranking it up you need to spend AP which is gained when you level up. Back when I first played this game AP was really hard to come by so you had to pick and choose what skills you want to work on, the same can't be said now as I have more AP than I know what to do with! Personally, this is a bad thing hiding underneath a good thing. Having all this AP means that you can work on more skills, but at the same time it means that everyone can pretty much be a jack-of-all-trades. This bothers me slightly because it takes away from the idea of players specializing in specific things, constructively forcing them to work together.Community is...well, as I said in my review of WAKFU, you have to know where to look for them. Sure you'll see a group of people hanging out in the Human starter town in channel 1 of any given server, but aside from that I don't see many people aside from your everyday player running to and from one place to another, too busy to stop and chat. There are guildstones placed all over the place, you can click on them to bring up information about that guild. You can also just pull up the guild interface and search for guilds so I find the guildstones pretty redundant. There are also guilds recruiting on Nexon's official forums as well as community forums, which gives the opportunity to speak to the leader or recruiters before joining.There are more features about this game that I'm missing, I'll be editing this review at a later date but I thought I should add some more of the game's core features to the review since it was originally pretty bland. I still recommend this game and even though I talk about negative points it is still a great game that you absolutely must experience at least once. Thank you for reading!			"

												I've been playing this MMO on-again-off-again for a very long time. I know my Steam hours don't show it, but back in the days of using Xfire I had over 2,000+ hours devoted to the game. I first started playing in 2008, around the release of G2. This is back when the game was still basically pay-to-play if you wanted to do any of the main storyline quests. These were the ""good ol' days"" that any veteran players will probably be referring to. Back in those years, we didn't have mounts, you had to pay to rebirth at all(no freebies), the game was just in general harder to move your way up. You needed real strategies to pull off defeating dungeons. There wasn't much of a classification between who was a poor noob and who was powerful because pretty much everyone was in a similar boat and there was a definite sense of community. (I made friends in those years that I still talk to on the regular and game with to this day.)Now that that whole memorial shpiel is over, I still love this game but♥♥♥♥♥♥what the Hell happened to it. Serious. This was a great game and you pooped all over it. The combat went from actually having to use strategies to ""if I spend enough irl monies I can defeat anything hahahahahhah.""The storylines are still pretty decent though?I still play this game and I've spent a lot of time and money on it. I will still probably be playing Mabinogi until it runs itself into the ground. Honestly, I don't recommend this but it is a game worth at least testing the waters in and seeing if you care for it at all.			"

												As a veteran who has played this game for 6-years, I would recommend this; however, this game has really reached its end-point and it has lost its luster. Why? There are various reasons and it's the reasons why I have left this game permanently, with some very few exceptions of coming back for the story content.NOTE: I have played more than 2000+ hours of this game; however, I have never kept it attached to my current Nexon Account, because the one attached to this is my banned account.Gameplay / Game Compatibility - The game engine runs on a pretty old engine from 2003 and it has hardly been tweaked for newer contents. While that might not be the problem, the reason why this game has issues here is because of the ""security programs"" and constant ""bug fixes"" that Nexon does. This game literally burnt out my previous computer, because it couldn't handle Nexon's new ""security programs"" and ""fixes"" between year 4 and 5, and had to buy an Alienware M14xR2 to keep playing at 30+ FPS a second. I can play Tera Online and Archeage and sustain better FPS at high graphics (which has a newer engine and better graphics) than what Mabinogi can do.Game Management - Horrible. DO NOT HAVE HIGH STANDARDS FOR THIS COMPANY AT ALL OR YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This company has went back on many of its promises to the player base in the past few years and literally doesn't investigate problems appropriately. There are hackers still playing who has been in major incidents for several years, while there has been countless innocent players banned because Nexon found them for ""illegal third-party clients."" Even I was one of these victims in year 4 of my gameplay, but I just remade my character after months of trying to dispute the claim with their e-mail and ticket system.Game Community - You can say this has the equalivency to Gaia Online. Dramatic, horrible, and down-right vile. While there might be a small group of players who actually are nice and look out for each other, the grand majority of the community is compiled of either: elitists, drama wh*res, fashion addicts, merchants, Nexon / Sabina whiteknights (people who solely defend Nexon with complete disregard of what wrong they've done), PvP addicts, pr*stitutes/womanizers, and/or trolls. I've played on three of the four servers and I can safely assume this is on all the servers.Game Events - Hallowed out and barely worth it. Out of the all events in two years, there is about 5~10% of the events that we actually get rewarded with decent stuff. Otherwise, all the events that get transferred from the Korean/Chinese/Japanese Servers get their rewards hallowed out and replaced into the gachapon / boxes. This is the only way how they can actually sustain their game services, because they literally advertise the hell out of gachapons and any event that requires you to spend money. (Basically, Pay2Win) So, you're basically feeding the company money for decent-quality events in the game. While they might've removed rebirth cards and such, they still ♥♥♥♥♥ out the gachapons and other services like crazy. And before I jump to the next part, Nexon loves putting those AFK events into the game.Teamwork vs. Solo - In the beginning, the game was heavily relied on Teamwork in the dungeons. You had to be a high level with some good gear to even sustain Solo capabilities (which also involed Pay2Win back then) in all dungeons. After several years, a level 100 with heavily overpowered gear can do about the same as some overpowered 2k+ player did back in the first 2 years of the game. I can understand if you're making a new character to restart, but the game has went overboard on how broken a newbie can be now.Overall - The game is actually good and such, but the company and community has ruined it to the core. I enjoyed the game over the past six years, but I had to finally put this game down in June and call it quits. The game wasn't really fun anymore, the community has been getting progressively worse overall, the game was starting to eat up more resources on my Alienware labtop, and the company kept forcing Pay2Win-events down everyone's throats. Why play a game that gear is heavily backed by Pay2Win options, a company that hardly takes care of the game and players and breaks it consistently, events that hardly has any value to them, and requires you to buy a new computer every year to keep up with the stability of the client? I wouldn't.			"

												No.I remember excitedly waiting for the Closed Beta to begin. Constantly rewatching the Lorna & Pan shorts so I could learn a little about the world I was about to dive into. I also remember getting to play for an hour then getting dragged off the computer to do chores. The game has cool and unique concepts but it's notthing like it was almost a decade ago. The cash shop is riddled with things you'll need to survive. From pets for transportation, buffs, debuffs, storage, and heals. Potions that can keep you from getting a debuff called Potion Poisoning which makes pots give less Hp/Mp/Stam back and also lowers your stats. Tons of Gachapon, or like I called'em Gachapwn'd. And biggest ♥♥♥♥ you of them all. Reforges.Read the other reviews and you'll learn of them.The game was so alive. Now it's a ghost town. The only place you'll see people is the main town of Dunbarton where all they do is stand around for hours afk playing the Fashionogi game. It's sad sight to see when you know how the game once was.It's free and won't hurt to try it but take some advice from a Mabi vet. Just don't.			"

												The game can be stale at times, but last night just made me want to write a review. It's because of night's like those that I still play the game. So I'm just minding my own business, I see a party ad for a title someone wants to buy that I happen to own. Well, I note them, we agree on the sale and whatnot. Well, they then proceeded to invite me to run Lord missions with them. The entire time we're just having laughs and fun. A person who was there was beating enemies with his hammer and pickaxe. At some point he realized he could use the new skill, ""Bash,"" with an umbrella, and well. I pulled out my american flag umbrella and brought democracy to all of Erinn that night. LMAO.After that, we went on to do caravan trading, better known as commercing. We just talked and goofed off the entire time. We finally travelled all across Uladh, from Tara to Bangor, and just hung out in front of the trading tent. It was grand. Now these were TOTAL strangers. People I'd never played with/talked to before. I've been playing since G1, and I'll tell you, this game is THE BEST when you play with some good folks. I didn't add them, but I know if I see them again, I'll be more than happy to greet them. GOOD TIMES GOOD LIFE. MABINOGI DA BEST WOOTZ.			"

												Mabinogi is an extremely addictive MMORPG created by Nexon, who have a history of creating addictive games such as Maplestory and Vindictus. I'm a relatively new player, been playing for about 2 months now, have spent 300$+, with 900+ hours, despite a majority of those hours being spent AFK, I feel like I have put in enough time to write a review. I haven't advanced very far in the story, I'm still in G1 (Generation 1 of 20) so I can't say much for the story, but from what I have heard, it's nothing amazing or mind-boggling. A majority of my time playing Mabinogi has been spent doing events, buying gacha's, life skills, and merchanting.I've spent a lot of my time merchanting, which means I've gotten to know the community quite a bit, I've met some really interesting people, who actually want to engage, socialize, and help new players, however I've also met people who only sit around and complain about the game 'dying' despite constantly playing it non-stop and just ruining others fun.As previously mentioned, I spent a fair amount of time and money buying gacha's, a gacha is a box which contains or sometimes contains armor, clothes, etc. One of Mabinogi's major problems is they're constantly releasing or re-releasing NX bought items, instead of focusing on fixing the current game. It's worth to note Nexon, has been releasing or re-releasing a gacha everyweek, as soon as one ends, another begins. Pets and partners. in Mabinogi you can own pets which are summons, depending on which ones, you can mount them, name them. and they'll even fight in battle for you, each has it's own individual skills, partners are similar to pets as you summon them and they can fight for you, interact, and have their own skills. You're able to get 3-4 pets for free, not including events which sometimes allow you to earn some, but besides that you have to buy them with NX or in-game gold and buy them from someone who bought them with NX. Partners on the other hand, have to be solely bought NX and I don't believe you can buy them from other players. It's also worth noting, you can only buy certain pets / partners when Nexon puts them up for sale, which aren't cheap, the prices range from 3-20k NX or 3-20$.Mabinogi's release date was 2004, however it released in North America in 2008, so it's a fairly old game and it shows. Unable to start the game, the game crashing, constant disconnects, screen flickering, audio cutting out, stuttering, abysmal frame rate, these are just a few things I've run into performance wise.Another thing that has aged poorly is the Mabinogi combat, It feels very clunky in general and skills sometimes won't load, you'll get hit when enemies aren't near you and the AI is a bad joke at times. As an Elf archer in Mabinogi, i'm currently at a huge disadvantage, as when archer's load an arrow in their bow sometimes they won't shoot or there's a 3+ delay, which will get you killed seeing as most enemies can 1-2 hit you. This has been a problem for years, and it hasn't and most likely will not be fixed.Mabinogi is a unique and addicting game, it saddens me to see it be so neglected by Nexon, for this reason, I can't recommend it, as there are just so many better options.TLDR; Dwindling player base, lack of bug / glitch patches, weekly gachas, mediocre playerbase, old engine, lackluster / clunky combat, there are better alternatives.

												This once was an amazing game.

An Affectionate Retropective...I haven't touched this game in a while, thus I can't represent what the game is now, however I can give my thoughts on what it was like a few years ago. The only reference used here is my own memory; this will mostly likely have bias, as a person who did enjoy the game. I bolded the important bits for tl;dr.The story is actualy good for once, or at least the first three generations were. I can't remember what the rest of them were about, though I do remember that they continued the story line in one of the later generations (17~18 I believe). I don't think I've ever seen characterization of this extent in any MMORPG; to this day I still occasionally wonder what ever happened to Triona and Ruari. The NPCs are recurring, meaning that they still are relevant through out the game relative to the story. There's even a relationship system with the NPCs, though I do think it could be fleshed out some more. Perhaps they've already fleshed it out by now, who knows? I remember giving lots of bread to the nun that's always outside the Church in Tir, I'd finally got her to warm up to me after ~50 loaves of bread and occasionally she'd give me a boiled egg. It was ... heart warming, and it's probably the only thing remotely similar to human affection I'm ever going to get from a girl.The music is god tier. Each NPC has their own special song. The nun outside the Church had a particularly wonderful tune. Here it's better to show you, listen for a bit: 


YouTube™ Video: Mabinogi NPC- Endelyon 

			Views: 6,140		

			She wears a simple black dress of a Lymilark priestess with no remarkable features. Her chestnut hair, in clear contrast with her transparent complexion, hangs down below her shoulders.		

It almost seems like each song was composed to maximize nostalgic value, even more so once I heard the lyrics to the theme song sung by Tanaka Rie; it was as if it was speaking directly to former players. Not to say that new players can't enjoy the music as well, it's just that listening to these pieces right now, it has more impact than one would think.It's an ever lasting game. There is no level cap, how it works is that every so often you'd reset yourself to level 1 again keeping your skill progression. You can literally play for as long as you want with out it getting too slow to level. And when I speak about leveling it doesn't nessesarily mean grinding.Even with the unconventional combat system (for it's time), you're not required to grind or even kill anything at all. The game doesn't follow the point, click, and wait system that was common during that time, it was a little more dynamic than that; in fact back in the day getting hit twice usually meant death. Goblins, being one of the lower forms of enemies, would still deal out high amounts of damage both in raw damage and in numbers (multi-aggro). The good thing is that you don't have to kill monsters if you don't want to, with the release of non-combat leveling, you can be a farmer that levels up by touching chickens, milking cows, etc, or you could just blacksmith things all day. I found it particularly fun to simply search for gems to feed to the loli living in my knife.Customization is a core aspect of the game. If I had one good thing to say about Nexon's cash grabbing, it's the customization options. They do a pretty good job of offering a bunch of choices. That's all on top of the innate customization in the game, I can't even count the amount of clothing articles this game has. Even in the case that you see someone wearing the same thing you are, there's dye. mathmatically there are millions of possibilities, for God's sake you can dye your weapons. You write your own music, you design your own plot of land, etc. Combat wise some of the key choices the game shoves at you is Paladin vs. Dark Knight, Elf vs. Giant, I think you have to choose the Demi-god thing too; I can't say for sure, I never got that far in the game (those quests were too dificult for me).Not to say there's nothing negative to say about Mabinogi...The graphics may be a bit blocky for this generation, especially with these fancier games coming out. My defence to this is that the magnitude of customization offered here would not be realistically possible with ""next gen"" graphics, though keep in mind this game is aged, for if we look at Elder Scrolls, Black Desert, etc we can obviously see model level character customization. Even those games however lose to Mabi in the amount of apparel there is.From what I understand with recent updates the player character gets incredibly stronger, putting less emphasis on the need for tactics. (Who needs tactics when enemies that used to 2-hit you now only deal 1 damage). Perhaps this is to accomodate for this new age, refer to Pokemon ORAS and it's justification for not having a Battle Frontier.I remember the movement system being a little quirky, though they did mention they were working on improving it, adding features like auto-pathing and anti-clipping.There's actually so much more wrong with the game, but to me it's just part of what makes it special. In fact, given this age, I predict that you probably won't like the game; the AI was all over the place, it was really laggy sometimes, and there were many glitches. In the end, they all just grew on me after so long.Well this is the best I could do at hopefully getting someone to play the game, or not play it, having nothing but a past experience. Trust me, I have well over the ~200 odd hours that is documented on Steam, as Mabinogi only got put on Steam well into it's life. The only reason I stopped playing was because I could not play due to starting college a few years back, and believe me I consider myself somewhat tech savvy, I tried everything in my power to get around the port-blocking set in place by the school. I think this game is largely player driven, and without those players, you'd find the game to be quite stale. I have no idea how the player base is with this game of this moment, I don't know if this game is dead, but I have played of lot of these newer MMOs (Dragomon, Tree of Savior, Blade & Soul, etc) if the player base resembles that of the newer games, where everyone is about their own business not even bothering to stop and talk, the game might as well be dead. To spare myself from that I'll just leave it at that. I'll probably never play this game again as it's been far too long for me to get back into it, but I gotta say those few years that I did play were some damned good years. I'll always compare any new MMO I play to this game and will probably always be dissapointed.Now for those of us that did used play the game, instead of a closing statement, take a moment to watch this video:

												Now, I am by no means an expert on this game. However, to all the people who say it's ""dead,"" I'd have to say I disagree with you. In the starting village alone I saw several high-level players just hanging out and chatting while a bunch of noobs like myself were running around doing the tutorial missions.Later on, in the first major town you visit (Dunbarton) I met a decently large group of people standing aroung playing music. I blew all of my money on a lute and a ukelele and joined them. In the process, I met a couple of friendly players who ended up teaching me the art of combat later on. After they logged off, I went back to Dunbarton and spent an hour jamming with this guy who had a lot of custom music. I made a total of 3 friends.ConclusionWhile Mabinogi may not have as large a population as, say, WoW or Tera, it is by no means dead. The community, as a whole, is friendly and helpful. If you're a skeptic like me, you should check out this game. I'd give this a solid 9/10.P.S. my computer only has the integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics, and this is the most visually pleasing game I've ever managed to run. It runs surprisingly well.			"

												While Mabinogi is pretty new to Steam. I played it when it first came out #hipster. Mabi is a game that basically plays like a more awesome, anime version of Runescape. If I have to be honest. You can train talents and skills related to combat, tailoring, cooking, carpentry, fishing, etc. It's basically a virtual life simulator that happens to have weapons and monsters involved. There are marriages, familiies, and of course the classic guild. The combat system is strategy based, with a heavy emphasis on stacking and planning out the use of your skills (Combo. If you will). Simply left clicking on an enemy is enough sometimes, but when you start diving into deeper dungeons, or the dark, deep wilderness - you're going to want to know how to run your dang combat skills. Recent updates have made the game MUCH more accessible as far as talents and skills go. And with frequent. FREE updates coming constantly, there's no shortage of content available to keep even the ""old school"" players entertained. The music is amazing, and the art style is a pleasant, cell shaded anime style that appeals to a great deal of players.It's F2P, so the only thing you honestly have to lose is time. I would recommend Mabinogi to anyone into MMORPGs.			"

												Love this game! Have played for abut 8 years. They are always coming out with new events and new pets you can get for your characters! Plus its a free to play. You can make purchases such as pets and outfits but can still do really well in the game without using real money! I would recommend this game to anyone there is always something for everyone!			"

												I've found that I can be really picky about MMO's to the point that I'll only play one or two. Character customization and freedom are key things for me and Mabinogi has those. It is not perfect, but I don't think any MMO will ever be. I'll list some of the good and the bad (and other key notes) and let you decide if it's for you.--Cons--Nexon/Cash Shop: The cash shop does support the game, but with people spending hundreds, if not more, each time a Gachapon comes out it gets a bit excessive. There are some useful consumables, and some pets and outfits that change frequently.Grinding: Grinding is very real in this game. Finding materials or items for quests or crafting can take hours. Training some skills can also be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥AP: Skills are more important than levels and all skills have their own rank and use AP to get those ranks. I listed this in the Cons because it shouldn't be spent wildly, even though it is technically unlimited, because it can take a while to get.Quests: A number of the quests are the generic, lackluster fetch or hunting quests.--Pros--Events: Nexon always has some sort of event running and 9/10 are at least decent (there is one where I had to fight two dragons (with other players) and all I got was a crappy MP potion. That event was cut short and replaced). Some events will give cash shop consumables, unique outfits, pets, exp, or just other unique items.Customization: There are several free options for physical appearance and your armor and weapons can be dyed. Finding a player with the exact appearance and outfit and colors would be difficult unless you coordinate it.Classless: Something I like in games. Rather than choosing a class, you choose a talent that helps with training associated skills. You can change your talent and it doesn't restrict any equipment or skills. You could be a Mage with heavy armor bashing things in the face with an umbrella. Story: There is an extensive story, but all of it is optional. There are some exceptional rewards for parts of the story (transformations, a free pet) but with the open world you never have to touch it. It's also possible to start later parts of the story. Best of all, the quests are generally unique.--Neutral--Dungeons: Dungeons are randomly generated and are have some unique rewards. Searching for a specific reward, however, goes back to the grinding note. It's especially annoying to have a multiple floor dungeon and not get the drop you need.Races: There are three playable races in game, each with their own pros and cons. This and your name are the only things locked about your character, but I listed it in Neutral because I'm not especially for or against it.Tutorial: They added a new tutorial a while back that allows you to learn the controls and even allow you to sample the talents before you pick your first one. Sampling the talent includes the higher tier abilities for that talent so you have an idea of what to look forward to. If I recall, parts of it are skipable (good if you have another character), but other parts are not. You'll also always start at that tutorial when creating a character.Overall, I'd rank Mabinogi a 8/10. There's an extensive wiki available online, and you can find some helpful cash shop items in player shops (can be a little expensive though). There's also a few minor glitches, but all games have that.Edits: Added a mention of a tutorial update they did a while back. I just never brought it up.			"

 Mabinogi and how I feel about it After Spending around 900 hours in this game, I do believe it's time I make a review for Mabinogi.In short, mabinogi is a Open World, Fantasy Life MMO, You're free to do literally anything you want too, you can run around and explore dungeons or you can take up smithing and make weaponry, or you could take up tailoring or carpentry instead, you can even play music to help buff your team mates in what they're doing.Honestly, I've put a lot of time into Mabinogi because I fell in love with it's charm and how it plays, it's not super fancy, it doesn't have the top notch graphics that most MMOs have nowadays but it has so much more to offer outside of it's looks that it just blows other MMOs out of the water.With that said, there are quite a few Cons for Mabinogi too, forinstance the lack of support for people who are on newer system and the extreme amount of stuff to wrap your head around, it's very overwhelming, it's not really as popular as a lot of other MMOs either, which to me is honestly a good thing because that means most people on there are just as deticated on there as you and are usually willing to help a friend out, it's also just not built as well as most other games either.But overall, I'd recomend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun time in a vast open world~and if you need someone to help you out, gimme a call :P			"

												I've played mabinogi since the release of Generation 2 on the NA servers. I really enjoy the game even with it's faults and bad times. It's currently haveing a slow time atm but it's still fun if you find the right group of players to hang out with! I highly recomend it to others looking for a game to enjoy and just take it slow and easy.			"

												Mabinogi is a rock-paper-scissors type alternate-life MMO. Essentially this means the main core aspect of the combat, is based off of a rock-paper-scissors system in which each skill has an added advantage, and disadvantage. There is no real class system in Mabinogi, for mostly every character can fully master every available talent that is provided in the game, save for race specific talents. This means that you as a player start off very weak, and can rise to the ranks of the most formidable opponent through time, patience, and effort. It is plenty fun to slowly accumulate new skills, new weapons, and develop your own combos. This game is great in the fact that there are no class barriers, you can master every talent, from which, are a few such titles such as Warrior, Martial Arts, Knight, Mage, Archer, Bard, Gunner, Ninja, etc. All of these talents can be used together in synergy to create a stronger, hybrid-type talent through practice. This game has its own storyline, PVP system, and three continent world.Although Mabinogi does not offer too much in terms of raw character creation capabilities, it makes up for this loss by providing a multitude of clothing, armor, and such to buy, find, or create as you start your journey in Mabinogi. As a veteran player who has essentially everything mastered, and has done everything available to be done, I can say without a doubt - Mabinogi certainly is fun. However, depending on what kind of person you are, you may not like the community of Mabinogi - which is heavily saturated with lovers of anime culture and the like (whom of which it is technically marketed towards) - and you will most definitely not like the Pay to Win aspects this game creates with its cash shop. Mabinogi is completely conscious of just how much earnings they can reap in by giving players the upper hand in the game, and what some may say an ""unfair advantage"". While others work hard for their items and damage, can be attained with a couple of paychecks in a fraction of the time by people who are so inclined. Disregard these unfortunately major problems, and Mabinogi is quite a fun and satisfying game, however these issues certainly must be taken into consideration. Overall, this game has some really nice core aspects, but a fair amount of internal, problems such as community and pay 2 win really deduct from this games potential. I would tell you to check it out, and see if you like it. It's much better to play with friends, or make friends who can help you along in the game as it can be rather difficult and over cumbersome at first. I thought it was terrible the first time I played it, picked it back up, and now I have more than ten thousand levels under my belt.			"

												I've played since 2008, so I have way more hours logged than what I've played on Steam. As such, I can say that I whole-heartedly recommend this game... if you have friends to play with. It's a hard solo experience, with a very rewarding dungeon system that gives better loot at higher difficulties (but you're not able to outright solo them). The questing is a tad sparce, but it makes up for that with a chapter based story system with fleshed out cutscenes that tell the story of Erinn very well.Now, as it's a Korean MMO, it's very grindy. Very, very grindy. The game softens this, however, with its unique rebirth system; every 7 days, you're able to start over from level 1 and ages 10 through 17. Your character ages up every Saturday, and as they do, they gain stats and ability points (AP). There is a diminishing returns factor when it comes to stat gain.The pet system is a lot of fun, giving you the ability to play as your pet and level them up in dungeons. They do have a time limit, however, which replenishes every real morning. They are a real boon to your gameplay, giving you a large inventory to compliment your own, and opening up a plethora of combat tactics. Unfortunately, they cost real money in Nexon's very aggressively marketed NX shop.The combat is a lot of fun albeit clunky. Although, the game is from 2003, so it gets a pass. It doesn't help much that Nexon's servers are some of the laggiest pieces of garbage known to mankind (the dungeons are on a seperate server, and that SoB crashes so much and if you're inside a dungeon when that happens, the monsters will not spawn and loot will not drop). Nexon support is janky at best; they do respond, but most of the time give copy-paste responses. However, this doesn't affect my opinion on Mabinogi on a whole.The community used to be one of the best. Helpful, friendly, always willing to play with you and hang out. Of course it did have its bad eggs and drama queens, but it was amazing. It changed for the worse over the years, where everyone sticks to themselves, are unwilling to help those in need (unless you're their friend or popular), and play the game only for the fashion (which isn't a bad thing, but is similar to RuneScape's atrocious bankstanding culture). I've met some of my best friends on this game, some whome I still keep in constant contact with.Overall, the game is a lot of fun. You will most definitely have a vastly different experience than what I've had. It will be a great experience where you will meet friends, form relationships, and embark on an amazing journey.9.5/10 where the last .5 is just from minor nitpicks that I'd rather not divulge into.

												Despite being a game originally made in 2004, I can guarantee you that you will not find another game that can compare to this.The main thing about this game is the fact that there is technically no level cap - while there is a ""soft cap"" at 200, you can make use of the Rebirth system to continue leveling, easily growing you character's level into the thousands and even tens of thousands. You can also play the game however you like: want to be a sword-weilding elf wearing beach shorts and sandals in the middle of a frozen tundra? Go right ahead.If you want to be a gun-toting Giant in armor that also knows how to make potions and is a high ranking singer? Well get to work on it!Want to master every skill tree? Only thing that's stopping you is AP restrictions but you can if you want. Don't want to be involved in combat, and do nothing but play the game as a pacifist? Yup, you can do that too by fishing, gathering, blacksmithing, and more. Players also get a homestead that they can decorate with decorative props and items that can be used with training life skills and some alchemy skills.There's a lot that I could go on about with this game, both good and bad, but as I've mentioned earlier there's a lot this game can offer despite its age.

MABINOGI REVIEW================***Please disregard my Steam time. I have played this game outside of steam and have at the least, 3000 hours of playtime in total. By the way, I play in the server, Ruairi just in case you are curious.***This game has to be the closest MMORPG I have played to a fantasy life with combat. (Kind of like the Sword Art Online Anime, but not really). I have never came across a game just like Mabinogi. In addition, it is highly addicting after you push yourself to play the game. I have actually quit this game for a year just a few days after I got it, then went back to it after a friend of mine pushed me to play it again. Anyways, I will go ahead and go through some of the game components so one could get a feel of how the game is like:FEATURES----------This game offers the following:PROS------*Customization of character/homestead.*Mostly friendly community, willing to help other players and socialize.     - Guild system.*Numerous different enemies and bosses to fight against.*Boss raids.*Offers different kinds of talents with unique skills and specializations & you can specialize in all of them.      - Ex: Ninja, gunslinger, cook, lumberjack, blacksmith, warrior, mage, etc.*Nice NPC portrait art with specialized music.*Music.     - You can make your own music and play with different instruments such as the piano, violin, guitar, mandolin, etc. (Yes! You can even make the Legend of Zelda Theme Song or Go Go Power Rangers or Disney Music. Anything really is what you can replicate in game.)     - Mabinogi music is soothing and effects the mood sometimes.*There is a storyline.     - Featuring, currently Generations 1 to 20 in addition to the Iria Sagas and side quests.*Open World.*Many Dungeons.*Get married in-game and have your own family with unique attributes.*3 Different Races     - Human     - Giant     - Elf* PVP system.*Transformation System     - Transform into your favorite NPC, animal, or enemy.*Cosplaying in game     - There are built in outfits such as the Fate Stay Night outfits or Sword Art Online. (You can dress like Saber, Gilgamesh, Kirito, Asuna, etc.)      - You can also form your own costume with in game items. I saw a guy dress up as Links from Zelda once and another guy dressed up as Iron Man. You can accompish this by dying clothing and knowing which outfit fits the character you are trying to cosplay as.*You can dye your clothing any color you want with dye ampoules.*Play Carnival games and other mini games in Festia.CONS------*The community is slowly dying      - The community is probably less than 3/4 what it was a year ago.     - Many people go AFK (Away from the Keyboard) in game.*There are many ""recycled"" in-game events.*Some unfixed bugs and other programming issues.     - Glitches     - Random Black Screens     - Screen Freezes*There is some lag but the lag is not too bad on an average computer.*Items that can be bought with real cash for ingame use can be expensive, and some of the best items cannot be earned in game (Pets/Outfits/Stat Boost Puppets/Partners).     - On the bright side, you don't need to buy items with cash to get cash bought items because you can buy them from other players. Just need to save, spend, and invest in in-game currency wisely.*Customer Support can be pretty bad...*Servers are like totally separate worlds in a different dimension.     - I don't know about you, but I just don't really like the idea because pets and items are untransferrable between servers. In other words, if you have a pet named Fluffy in server Ruairi, you can't have that particular pet, Fluffy, in server Mari.*Deleting your character does not give you a blank character card... In other words, if you delete that character, you will not be given a new character card to replace that. (-1 Character slot)*Mabinogi is not doing a good job recruiting new players, currently, so please join. (Please come to Ruairi). lol ;)OVERALL:=======Presently, Mabinogi has become the ""Fashionogi"" game where character customization is very big in the community. Not many players run dungeons or do any sort of real combat anymore. However, it is a game that you can find yourself coming back to no matter how many times you might say you want to quit after you got into it the first time.Anyways, I hope this review helps everyone who is thinking of getting this game or checking out games to play.

												A once great game now nothing more than a black hole for your wallets bordom.  Maginogi, coming on 9 years live, has seen better days with more activity.  What can be said?  Nexon, the publishing company for the devcat studio based in Souel, South Korea, has watch its hit game run into the ground.Nexon is no better, letting employees abuse the job by ban hammering anyone they please or creating chaos without due consequence or respect.  Before Danel Kim showed up with KNoxxr, the infamious CFO, VP to PR; Mabinogi held on to the top 5 list in IGNs best free to play, letting player customize thier ""Fantasy Life"" and giving them room to follow a path of their own choosing without talent trees to follow.  Mabi once held a hybrid subscription, where you could play as much a you want but things like mainstream storylines and talking with your egos, was not premitted unless you paid the 15$ a month.  Rebirths weren't free either.  So whats changed and does it get my seal?First off lets look at events.Events have always had something to remember them by in terms of unquieness.  Now every three months there is a fishing event.  Events now do not reward the player justly as it did 2-3 years ago.  Events are also tuned a step above in terms of difficulty.  So no matter what your doing some event that you just can't solo, and if you do; the reward never fits, ever.RNG.RNG, or random number generator, is heavly used in Mabinogi, mainly with life skills.  If you ever enchanted something, you know what I mean, if not this is how it works, mabi never has a 100% garuntee unless it involves quest items.  Now normally 100% meant 100%.  From experence, 100% isnt 100%.  At times the RNG feels more broken then working within the bounds it was meant for.  Even Will Saves don't always roll and check.  That being said it doesn't seem like the game likes playing fair.Content.Lately Content seems exhusted from being crapped out every 6 months for huge lore updates.  The latest Saga season feels rushed and doesn't even explain anything past the re washed Ruairi hates everyone and no one live a hapy life.  Old content has now been nerfed.  Honestly, I hate how g1-12 have been reduced, even noobs can take Glas on alone and win.  Although I do get bragging rights for about 90% of my toons passing g3 before nerfdom, the nerf given is a bit extreme.  Without a level cap, or an end game result, nerfing kinda felt pointless.Leveling.Leveling no longer require grinding.  Before g17, players were capped at 100, requiring more exp to be gained between times.  Level 30 for most was the start of grindy.  Now players can level to 100 with no problem.  With Mobs that carry the Ancient title, exp is increased greatly for those not label weak against you.Combat, Loot and game Mechanics.Ok, here I'll start with combat.Starting off in G2, you could use the skills you obtained from vairous parts of Ulhaid, and make combos or useful ideas to down a somewhat OP mob.  Now the combat engine features a no load, post-use cooldown.  Effectivly making me feel weaker and using my skill with way more cumbersome use.  Before you could use stradegy or have a unquie fighting style, where now is more number crunching to one hit everything.Loot is for the most part off and on when it comes to getting that one thing.  For one, Ancients used to drop items that normally you would find in Advance dungeons, Theater Missions, Shadow Missions, or quest items like Fireball shockwave thunder or Ice Spear.  They now drop nothing.  Mabinogi also has annoying times where the loot given for very hard mobs dont fit what so ever.  Where trash drops better than average stuff where the boss drops trash.(Yes some do).  And if your looking to farm gold from Mobs, do not bother.  Your better off playing the market.Game Mechaincs are the only thing that do make sense.  If someone has a shield and is defending, no matter the skill the cannot be knocked back unless being charged.  SOme mobs have certain restrictions when it comes to fighting them.  However limited, mechanics still exist.Community is dead.Customer Support is really a bad joke now.  Submit a ticket and get a response in a week, if your graced with good fortune.  Everyone who answer a ticket is cryptic, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag, or plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy.  They treat you like♥♥♥♥♥♥and still expect you to be ok with it.  GMs are now not allowed to make them selves public due to a bad day in Dunbarton.  PR is not something Nexon is fond of assocating themselves with.  Modders have even moved on, not to the 5 anti cheating systems now in place, but merely because Nexon will ban anyone for any reason no questions or refunds.Cash shop.It has its sales, it has good things.  Mainly more for people who have nothing else to blow money on.Graphics.The same when it launched.  Mabi uses an anime style of CGI.  But no improvements have been made since.  Same with Sound.This is a game for those who once played it, I will never recommend a Nexon game, ever.  Mabinogi is more for those who want nostagla.  Otherwise, your in for a night of swearing.

												Phew... I think it's about time to rework this now that the nostalgia goggles are 100% off.Mabinogi has been a wonderful experience for me. I've always found it engaging. I've always enjoyed it. That's probably never going to change for me. I've discovered and experienced so much magic in this game, that it will most likely always hold a dear spot in my heart and memory, even if it is sad at times. I've met people in it that I've been friends with for a long time now, and we'll probably be friends for many years to come. I'll even go as far to say it's played a major roll in shaping me into the person I am today, and that is a person I'm very proud of. I've had such an intimate relationship with this game and I'll probably keep revisiting it till, for whatever reason, I can't anymore. Across both Nexon's main site (where I prefer to play) and steam, I have well past 5,000 hours by now, and I'm not done yet. Maybe soon, but not yet.So... Why am I not recommending this to new players?Mabinogi... It's dieing. Not a graceful death, where it's finally played out it's course. No, it's a bit more tragic then that. Slowly, very slowly, but surely. It's well past it's prime, and in recent years, Nexon's been milking it more and more for cash, and turning the focus from low fantasy to flashy, over-the-top and stylish. Looking at it now, I wouldn't blame someone for thinking it's something it's not. Mabinogi is losing it's identity, and it's a very sad thing to see happen to something that was once such a giant. The kind of game people pointed to and said ""That one's a legend.""I'm going to stick around if only because of the memories. That will never die for me. Newcomers won't have those, however, and at this point... Sure, for a short while, you might see glimpses and sparks at what Mabinogi used to be. You might be enamored with the combat system which is, I promise, something that no other game has managed to do as well. But once the initial reaction wears off, you'll look at this as another ""whatever"" game. Hell, maybe even a bad game.If you really want to give it a go, go right ahead. You'll find a good game, though it will most likely be short lived.But you won't find a damn near perfect game. Not anymore.Thanks for the story, Grandma. It was absolutely beautiful.

												Like most of the reviews here. I am one of those who played before Mabinogi entered steam, and just as what others mention, this game really is one of a kind. I'd be tragic if Mabinogi ever died.I don't remember the exact year when I started playing, but there only used to be three or four classes you could pick, being the typical around MMOs, Mage, Melee, and the Archer classes.The community, I also found to be as good as family. Like most others, I also wish we could still be in contact, because of how such an amazing time we had merely just socializing. The best part is, that you can actually start a family by getting married and adopt others. ""Living the fantasy life"" just as they say.Being unique is also a very major thing they worked well on. Having the exact same clothes, with the exact same colour, is even more rear to find than in real life. But I happen to be lucky enough to get the majority of my clothes that I buy at the time to be themed Yellow and White, giving my own signiture no matter how much time passes.The major parts in customization would be the absurd amount of clothes they have available to sell. While some are very high price, nice clothes can still be bought at a decent or rather generous price for their beautiful, impressive, or complex design.While I can understand the complexity it takes to upgrade the graphics and having to almost completely rebuild the game to impove the travel and combat system, as well as the general animations for the envioment interaction. I find the lacking of these improvements really bothered me, even when I continued to play frequently, or when I return every couple of times. It really annoyed me when I get stuck in complex or tight spaces, like in small stores, or between trees, when chopping for some wood, and having to click a lot to get out. I like how the designs are improving, but because of the old age of the game with it's unimproved flaws, it really sets me back on how much more I can actually enjoy it. But I guess that makes it classic.Still to this day, the combat system is a bit lacking, but it's very unique, being able to approach combat with different tactics and styles. Especially over time when they began to implement much more unique ways for combat that are not found in many other MMOs.The thing I love the most about the combat system, is that you don't have to stick to your class all the time and could use a mix of skills, hybridizing any skills you decide to build on your character, beaing able to master all classes and obtaining hybrid titles to prove your skills.There are times when people mention how bad I am at building my skills, especially when contributing to melee even though I'm an elf. At first combat was really hard for me, being an elf was really being like a glass cannon, having impressive magical and archery power, but heavily lacks on the armour and defence department.Until you manage to get stronger, then even an elf, with just light armour on, could withstand just as much as humans and giants can.But as a hybrid, I looked for more ways to withstand damage, the exciting part, is that I can actually do that. My most happiest momment is when I obtained the Mana Shield skill. Able to withstand all sorts of attacks, but the weaker the skill, the heavier burden it is to your mana pool.Later on, with the release of a dedicated music skill set, with the already ability to write your own songs, they included skills you could use to support your team directly by improving their abilities in combat and non-combat situations, much more instruments and the ability to fight with them. Being a big musical fan at the time, I loved the update and used my instument for every close combat situation, expressing how much I love music. At first I got into alchemey and tried to master the golem, but as it was high maintence and quite costly for long term adventuring, I dropped it for more simpler skills, but I still figured ways to reduce direct combat for my elf. Such as obtaining and training a pet. They helped me a lot in a varity of situations, such as holding my things, saving me from a group of monsters, or healing me and my party. But even when they are strong, they were not as efficent as fighting directly.Then after a while more classes arrived in Mabinogi. The most unique and game changing for me, was the marionettes. As an elf with a weak body and the massive difference in the marionette combat style, I absolutely loved this update more than anything else and I still look back in all my adventures with my pierrot marionette when ever I think of Mabinogi.The biggest difference in this combat style was when you equip the control rods, you could still use them like regular weapons and includes three skills you could use to bind and pull your enemies with, but the main role is to control your marionette, which you had to summon with no cost, other than actually taking care of it, had a ridiculous amount of health and defence conpairable to some or most boss grade enemies, and the combat, had their own unique damage, which mean't any enemy with any resistances will not be able to mitigate a marionette's attacks. They are also one of the few classes which has skills that can directly break through the defence skill and able to combat multiple opponents with a very large attack range. Also the stats required for marionettes are majored for Strength and Dexterity, which gave versitility for both melee, archery, and life skill majors, letting any race to be reletivly equal in terms of mastering the marionette. Using the marionette skills require stamina, but quite little compaired to most other stamina required classes, allowing for much longer combat with little worry of overspending your stamina and having to carry extra potions.There is little negitives I have for the marionette, other than being quite slow, which gives long range enemies opprotinities to attack it, but can be overcome by walking up to them yourself and using act 1 or attacking directly. Also it has incomplete skills, or ""acts"" having little combat varity but it does have a very high flexability for all sorts of enemies, dispite only having six marionette skills.All in all, I would like Mabinogi to be improved even if they have to rebuild Mabinogi, but I really would like them to keep all their content, and unique apporach to the MMO world. All the've built, really attracted and kept many people loyal to the game for a longer life span than most other MMOs.Back then when I saw them advertise with ""Live a fantasy life."" I thought ""What a joke!"" but when I look back, it was a life totally worth living. But now that many people I know are gone, it feels really lonely. To me, making new friends got a lot harder than before. But there still are some really good people out there.			"

												I've played close to every mmorpg out there, and Mabinogi is the very single game that stands out to me. It has so many skills, many different classes to choose from, and a rebirth system that allows you to keep on playing without worrying about the level cap. My character just hit lvl 4200...Yes 4200 xD Thats almost 8 years of playing. Another great thing about this game is the social aspect to it. I can sit in the main town (Dunbarton) play my instrument, train some skills, and simply talk for hours to nearest ppl and make friends. Their is probably always a great event going on for players of any experience. They constantly update the game. Ah and one of my favorite features of the game is customization. In this game we like to call it fashionogi haha. Dressing your character in whatever you want, and dying your clothes whatever you want  without any level restrictions. I've even had my character cosplay Kirito from sword art online. I'm always shopping for new clothing! Before Mabinogi I played Runescape for many years. They are somewhat similar in the way the skills work instead of ranking skills from 1-99 its Rank F-1 which costs Ability points that you get from leveling up and rebirthing. I reccomend this game 100% I've stuck with it for 8 years already on the same character!			"

												Spent alot of the past year and a half on this game, I regret nothing.Pros:*You aren't bound to a class*Alot of options for fashion*You can dye most clothes and weapons*Alot of talents to try out*Morrighan*Still being updated with events*Most of the questlines scale with your combat power,  so you don't need to worry about following a linear storylineCons:*Outdated engine, causing FPS drops even on computer with high specs*Customer support has a low rating, though they do eventually reach you trying to help*Dying community*I wish healers had more of a prominent role, especially for spirit healer wands*Best girl Ferghus doesn't get enough loveIt's a good game to play with, especially if you have friends to play it with. Though if there are game breaking glitches  it can take awhile for Devcat and Nexon to do something about it. I once had a glitch that caused the game to crash through most custscenes, including the cutscenes that show bosses at the end of a dungeon, so I couldn't do any dungeons for about 3 monthes. I'll give it a bonus point for having something as unique as puppeteer as a class. All in all I give it an 8/10 glitches aside.			"

												Like a lot of you may have been I go from loving WoW and playing it a lot to not wanting to touch it and then doing the same thing all over again many... many times! :P So... I searched for a free alternative that had appealing visuals and since I am a fan of the anime aesthetic I figured what the heck it's free and cute so I'll check it out! First impressions of the game don't really excite me as much as the trailer had. The art in the trailer seemed more crisp and vivid to me but that could just be my graphic settings not correctly configured yet. The text can have some grammatical issues but it doesn't detract from the gameplay too much. The art style is a bit underwhelming, in comparison to what I had witnessed in the trailer, but still very cute. I am assuming that later on as I progress there will be more attractive armor sets. Anyways, some things I do like about it, and I'm even impressed with, so far is the fact that this game actually has more going for it than I expected! One of the cute things I really love about this game is that you can even have a culinary talent as well as some obscure things like going up to a chicken and taking its egg. I like this because it reminded me of one of my favorite games of all time, Harvest Moon. :P Another thing I really found cute and enjoyable about Mabinogi was the adorable pets!!! I don't own any yet but that definitely is something I would love! These are some of the cutest pets I've ever seen! I even saw a baby seal in a shark costume... >.< OMG MY HEART! :P lol So as you can see Mabinogi definitely has some strengths and weaknesses but overall I definitely recommend it if you are short on cash and want something free to play and pass the time by yourself or with friends. REMEMBER THE PETS!!! XD			"

												Mabinogi is free to play MMORPG.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Cute hand drawn cartoony looking artwork.  Has many crafting professions to choose from.  Building a homestead and getting married, collecting and raising pets, composing and playing music, puppetry.  Has Character Aging system and Rebirth every 7 days, you can rebirth to another gender, class, profession even.  Has extensive tutorials.  It was released in 2004.CONS:Looks like you could run out of inventory space easy, forcing you to trash or sell stuff or buy more inventory space with real money.  Items takes up number of spaces in bag depending on size and shape of object, and not stacking. Try it if you like easy going MMORPGs.For more info:

												Mabinogi is a fantasy life MMO, with a lot of content aside from fighting that is much more interactive than most other MMOs. Also, it is NOT PAY-TO-WIN.Hi. I urge you to strongly consider giving this game a try; you may just find it worth your time, and if not I won't stop you from turning away. If you don't care for some sections I made in this review, scroll past them. But - trust me that CHARACTER, COMBAT, and CONTENT are worth the read. Subsequently, I will try to the best of my ability to summarize different aspects of the game I have categorized this review into, in an effort to pique your interest in trying out MY FAVORITE GAME IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.1. INTRO: Mabinogi is an MMO game different from any you've ever played. If you plan to read on, throw out all you know old-school tab-targeting hotkey-mashing MMOs. If that's what you like, you DEFINITELY should try this game, because it'll be a very interesting experience for you. Mabinogi has no stupid beginner collecting/grinding quests, no slow leveling and skill-acquiring, no long exhausting distances to travel. In fact, suppress what you know about every MMO you have ever tried, because this game is just that different.2. FLAWS: I'll get the bad and ugly out of the way first so they scare you away before and not after you spend all this time reading my review.- This game is run by Nexon America, the same publishers of Combat Arms and Maplestory. Nexon users have reported bad experiences with customer support but it will be different for everyone.- The game will go down for maintenance subjectedly, sometimes up to thrice a month, but Nexon will give a 10-minute warning for the scheduled ones which usually only last hours.- Crashes are rare but not unheard of. Only people with personal shops lost items before in a crash, and Mabinogi's servers have only crashed once or twice in the past 6 years.- Bugs are rampant in this engine like an infestation of Bethesda Games' code's bugs with a mutation of gun-powered butts that just spray♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere and spit in your face to top it off. None are game-breaking, but some annoying bugs are seen in aspects like user interface.- Players can experience NA server lag because they are not timezone-based. From the East Coast, my latency in Tarlach is generally smooth.Still reading? I hope you are finding tolerance in these errors and will consider giving this game a chance. Read on.3. CHARACTER: Your characters are classless, cloneless, and 100% customizable. You will never find another person exactly like you. You will choose from different eyes and hairstyles, colors for both, as well as age and gender. You can shape your character however you like - your first one even has access to ANY premium facial feature (disregard what the game says about giving premium features to your first character).There is ZERO class selection. ZERO. Even after you select a talent, you are completely free to assign Ability Points to WHATEVER you wish along the way. Your skills train by actively using them and meeting requirements rather than by level. Spend AP (earned by leveling) to upgrade skills to the next rank. HOWEVER - you never run out of AP because of the rebirth system which I explain later in this review. Skills have 15 ranks each, and reward you with master titles when you complete the highest.Different schools of combat can be focused or, if you choose, not focused: Bows, 3 kinds of Alchemy (quite similar to Fullmetal Alchemist itself, even), Magic, or even Bard, Puppetry, Gunner, and martial-arts-like Fighter. Three elemental types in the game add to the dynamic fighting system - Fire, Ice, and Lightning. There are also life skills, like tailoring, blacksmithing, and fishing.A rebirth system allows you to reset to a current Level of 1 every few weeks (recently changed to every week), giving free regular access to more Ability Points to rank skills while keeping EVERYTHING about your character, while resetting only your age, current level (you maintain a total level), and if you choose, looks.4. COMBAT: similar to a kind of Rock, Paper, Scissors. I would define it as strategy combat. It requires a degree of timing and reaction-based approach. Skills are loaded and executed.5. COMMUNITY: There are guilds. Social interaction is a HUGE part of the experience of Mabinogi. Differences between any two can mean nothing at all. A friend window allows an email-like system. Gestures allow people to animate characters to fit their mood. Nothing at all can be transferred across the 4 servers, save friends and IM messages.6. CONTENT: You can fashion yourself with a HUGE selection of clothing items and dyes, or work on Life skills. Lack of classes allows for free switching and hybrid builds fit to your own playstyle. You don't have to find a single monster to bash the entire game - hone a life skill instead and be a merchant. You even own your own free Homestead.7. EVENTS: Nexon will add friendly (though oftentimes, very cheesy) events almost weekly where players participate in certain objectives to win rewards. None ever require pay-to-win or elite levels to take advantage above others.8, PETS: though most are bought with real money, the game grants you two free permanent mounts as you complete the beginner quests. All pets fight for you, are shared among ALL characters, and have inventories. Many have unique abilities.9. PvE: Enemies are found all across.Grinding is nonexistent in Mabinogi; it is never a requirement. In fact, the game penalizes your experience-gain for fighting in overworld fields for extended periods.Raids are in the form of field bosses which appear at certain times throughout a real-life week. Some will require upwards of 40 skilled Mabinogians to defeat, others may only require a few and have much less threat.10. PvP: Fighting other players is another very open-ended aspect of Mabinogi. One method is dueling a friend 1v1 anywhere. The other is arenas. PvP rewards are not a huge part of this MMO.11. STORY: The story is in installments called Generations. The interactive anime-based storyline is a sufficient length and is regularly updated. The mainstream story quests are completely optional, but they do delve your character deep into an enticing and dramatic plot.There is just so much content in Mabinogi that I will never be able to sum it up in a review. Use wiki.mabinogiworld.com, the most complete community wiki you will find for the game - it will answer mostly ALL of your questions as you learn to play.If you guys start to play, I'm on Tarlach server and my main character is Aznborne. Others are Leo172 and Leonnes. I'd love to play Mabinogi with anyone. I found this game 5 years ago, and I've always had an unforgettable time playing it. It is your own unique Fantasy Life itself inside a game.			"

												I've only played for 60+ hours, but I think I have a good idea of what this game is all about. Here is a list of everything subjectively good or bad about the game:-Buggy and glitchy. I've only tried the Steam client, but it's almost impossible to start up and impossible to quit. It crashes all the time, and lots of things ingame don't work. It usually takes me 3 tries to get the game running.-Visuals. The game does a good job at being very cutesy and anime, the style is not the problem. I'm sympathetic for a 2004 game, but the graphics are very outdated. And even then, the game is very poorly optimized and your performance is usually impaired by flashy abilities. Many of the dungeon maps are reused often resulting in confusing awkward rooms and hallways that have nothing in them. And the game's dungeons are always the same thing: Hit the orbs. Kill the mobs. Get the key. Go to the next room. Repeat until boss room.-Soundtrack. The music in this game is usually really bad, and sometimes ok. It's also very repetitive, with the same tracks used over and over again. Many characters have their own unique theme, however, which is a plus. Here's an example... make sure to turn your volume down for this one:

-Clunky Combat. The combat system in Mabinogi is unique, with a rock paper scissors type of system going on. Mabinogi is not a button smasher, and if you go in and press random buttons you will die. You have to actually go through the tutorial, and it's pretty frustrating and complicated to figure out at first. It's not even worth it in the end; yes, it makes the game harder as it forces you to pay attention, but the horrendous LAG that Mabinogi innately has makes the combat system which relies on reflexes impossible. Generally you just DC, everything stands still, and when you reconnect you're already dead.-You can play the game without paying money, with an exception of the social life aspects of the game. You have a homestead, which you can put things on for free overtime. However, you can't go inside your house (unless you pay for a different kind of home in a seperate place), and it's purely for looks or for a place to put work stations in. Even the houses you can buy and go into in the game cannot be decorated, and are used as stores where merchandise literally just lies on the ground. The game is very bland and has minimal scenery decoration indoors. You have to pay for pretty clothing and pets, making roleplaying even more difficult without spending money, especially for ""fashionistas"". Most everything combat wise however, is given to you for free as you go through the main questlines. You can get decent armor and weapons, and you can get a land mount and a flying mount. Most of the ""talents"" or classes are unlocked for free. Rarely, especially during certain ""events"" that happen over and over again annually (no new content), you can get the ingame shop items for free. Overall though, I'd say the game does a good job at not being P2W.-The game is essentially dead. You do most things alone, with the exception of some dedicated groups of players left. Definitely play on the most popular servers.-Bards. The game has bards, which is an usual sight in an MMORPG. The bards are a perfect example of something that can be both combat capable and something that can roleplay well. The music system in the game is really awesome too, since you can compose your own songs. There is a variety of instruments, though most are very expensive and difficult to get besides the standard lute.-No endgame content. There's very little to do eventually, especially if you power through it and try to progress quickly. I took my time slowly, which is where most of my playtime comes from. I wish I could give an unbiased recommendation, but I'm going to recommend it. I've heard that in the past it was much better. But as of right now, it's at that threshold where if you're really bored and looking for something to do, it's worth a try, especially for being a mostly free game. I had a fun time personally.Turn back now if you're looking for a good game. "

												I definitely do reccomend this game as a game to play, if you are a fan of MMORPGS. Despite, what my steam account says I have more than it suggests, due to me playing it before it was even released on steam. At the time of this review, I would say I have around 3000+ hours logged into this game. I have been playing this game for a very long time. I cannot really say that there is any other mmorpg that can match the experience that this game has given me. I can remember when I was noob struggling to slay the low level mobs and how I thought that they were impossible to beat by any means. Now a days I look back and remember those moments and just smile. All the friends and people I have met have become good friends that I am now glad to say are STILL my friends to this day. I can remember every single experience I've had in this game. That's the great part about this game, that I can remember all of these experiences, even if they were from years ago in a video game. I am still having great experiences with this game to this day. I don't really know how to put it, but this game has a had a huge impact on my life, whether it be for the good or bad... lol.I will give you a quick rundown on the game, just a gist.Mabinogi is an Anime fantasy life MMORPG game created by Devcat, and published by Nexon. The game is based off of Celtic mythology and takes place in the World of Erinn. You play as a Milletian A.K.A the character you created. There are currently three different types of races, Humans, Elves and Giants. So what do you do after you've created your character? You do whatever you want. That is what this game is about, you can do literally ALMOST anything you want in Mabinogi. Meet people, make friends! Have experiences. Be a Warrior? Be a Mage? Archer? How about a Ninja? Martial Artist? Yup, you can even control puppets too. Oh, and don't forget about those pesky life skills that are in other MMORPG games, don't worry though, if you have alot of patience then this game is for you. I warn you though, this game can quickly become addicting, if it's your style of game ofcourse. Okay, so that was a LITTLE more than a gist, but you get the point. (I hope)Pros:+ Artstyle looks nice and clean (if you enjoy that type of art anyway)+ Wide class diversity+ Wide Race diversity+ Decent playerbase+ Not new to MMORPGS of the genre by any means, but lively communites, parties, and guilds to help you with anything needed. + Limitless things to do+ A lot of unique skills to master, and occupy your time.+ You can see the actual progression of your character overtime.+ Unique events+ Interesting, and engaging storyline/questline.+ Rebirth/AP systemThe most unique leveling system I have seen by far. How does it work? The Rebirth system works like this. Every week you get a free rebirth, in which you can reset your character(s) levels, and looks. You rebirth to level 1, do not fret though... all those levels you gained go towards your cumulative level and in turn help your stats and provide you with AP which is given after each level up. What this system implies, is that there truly is no ""Max"" level.CONS:- Like any other Nexon game... the Cash shop and NX.- Toxic elitist players, like any other game.- Poor customer support on the Nexon.net website sometimes.- Very grindy (Definitely a game you have to be patient with)- Some skills are insanely hard to train (Hardly a con, but if you arent a fan of grinding then...)- The in-game economy (It's overpriced)- Servers can suck AT TIMES (not too often though)- Some classes have not received sufficient buffs like others. (Looking at you, Archery)- Handouts to new players- It's pretty hard as a new player, it takes a while to get some traction in the game.Final verdict. I give it a 8/10. The game has its problems, as any would with Nexon and their cash shop. It's pretty grindy, but if you have the patience then it should NOT be a problem at all. The in-game economy needs to change for sure. But most of the skills are unique, and feels unique when playing as each. The Rebirth system is just by far an AMAZING idea, and there is limitless things to do in this game. The storyline/questline really engages each individual player, and if you have the time this game is DEFINITELY worth a shot.			"

												This being my first legitimate review, expect lack of detail.Old, But funMabinogi was a game released in 2003 in south korea under a ""Pay to Play"" model, Obviously that changed later but that doesn't exactly matter now does it?What this game will do for youIf you can bear through a somewhat slow startup (depends on how well you pick up on things) The game can keep you entertained for quite a while. (Took me 5 years before I quit, A lot of hours aren't logged on steam) Imagine an MMO where you don't have to kill anyone. If you so please you can spend your time composing music, Making food, Potions, Clothes, Ect ect ect.The pace is set by the player, so the only limitation is you. This makes it good for people who tire of the constant ""Questing Only"" Thing that has taken so many mmorpg's. The lag is minimal (for those of you outside the US though, Good luck) The quests that are there have meaning and you actually have to pay some attention to what NPC's say to understand what the ◘%╦○ is going on.Its actually fairly lore intensive, And its still getting updates in actual content. Its combat system is pretty ""Rock paper scissors"" though, For example an enemy loads smash. You would load counter. Of course you could alternatively use windmill or hit them with magic, But sometimes that can be hard to do depending on proximity. Speaking of skills, theres a ton, I mean. A TON. You can mix and match how you please, There are no class limitations. So yes, you can be a ninja healer that also can cook the best food ever.I got nothin' left, Just ask about certain details and I'll probably explain better there (In comments, if this ever -gets- comments)TL;DR: Old game, Still fun. Constantly Updated "

												Mabinogi... is a thing. It has soo much content that you simply cannot do everything unless you dedicate all your time to playing. You can easily get lost in the game so much that you are planning and checking the Wiki constantly for how to do something.Graphics - While not the best graphics, the graphics themselves are fairly good. They fit in very well with the game's style. However, the Physical (collision, movement) portion of the graphics are complete crap. This is likely to do with the engine or bad net coding as a result of the poor engine. But the displacement lag among other things make this game something to yearn for.Content - You are not prepared. I do not know of any game that has the level of content that Mabinogi that is actually useful at all times. Unlike games like WoW, Mabinogi quests stay useful and do not go obsolete. The 'Generations' keep moving forward and new players start right from the begining. None of that ""Oh hey, you can do quests... but you will really only get to experience the current xpac and everything else is a faceroll"" kind of deal. There is also a very interesting and very long story to be told if you are interested in the RP aspect.Combat - Combat, as stated in the Graphics, is kind of meh. I think it could Vastly be improved if DevCat/Nexon took the time to upgrade the engine and fix the problems plauging the game. But, that will take time. I just hope it is in the pipeline soon. I actually think the combat style itself is very tactical and interesting, but suffers harshly because of the engine issues and terrible net coding.The game can be a bit hard on new players and players seeking to do the generations may find themselves struggling. Vetrans think the generations are too easy while new players think they are too hard. The game does have scaling built in, where it gives harder monsters based upon your combat power, but it has not been properly updated in some time.Overall, I would recommend the game if you like anime MMO's. Mabinogi has something not seen in other games so it is worth trying out (it is free after all). I think Mabinogi could have a very bright future if DevCat/Nexon start focusing on the ever-present problems with the game. But, you do learn to live with them and find quite a bit of joy playing the game. Whether you like to fight with magic, range, or close combat, you like to craft, make stuff, or trade, mabinogi has it.  "

												Ok I have 2 sides of this review, first off I do like the game. If you like skills that range from, well Range, to Cooking, to Magic, to Alchemy, to Sword Fighting, to god-like powers, to... well to everythign short of farting and picking your nose, then you'll probably like this game. The graphics are very low req but I still recomend a decent computer, OS, and connection.If you do join I suggest, STRONGLY, that you research the different servers for people who suit your play style, be it RP, Social, or being a butthead, seriously the servers populations vary so look into it.The game is a bit over hacked imo, I don't really care how someone else plays their game unless it interferes with mine, and it has come to that a few times, the fault of which is the second side to this review.I do not make a habit of bashing companies, in fact I usually support them and use to try to support this one. Now I understand that Nexon KR and Nexon NA are two separate companies and that Nexon KR treats it's customers very well, but Nexon NA does take it's orders from Nexon KR. Nexon NA has repeatedly lied to it's players, ignored problems until they're just so out of control that we had to reset and lose weeks of work (they use to only backup once a month a policy I hope has changed). They allowed players to rob NX (that's Nexon cash) without recompence and seemingly without bans for those who did it. They've allowed disruptive players who aided in completely trashing the game BACK into the game while permabanning others with minor offenses. Their support system leaves much to be desired (I'm told it has improved but as grandma use to say the proof is in the pudding)If you can put up with all that then by all means, play, and enjoy.			"

												Hello! My name is Nyxis and I am going to review Mabinogi! This is my first review, so I'm sorry if it sounds off at all.Mabinogi is an MMORPG based around... well, life itself. Fantasy life, specifically. You can be anything, from a bard, to a dual-blade weilder, to someone who just milks cows (production mastery!). The game is very old however, and the graphics in the starting town for humans (Tir) definitely shows it's age. The textures for newer items and such look much better than the older counterparts, but it can be a bit offsetting if you compare it to some newer games.Overall I'd give Mabi a 9/10 since other than the graphics (and some say clunky controls, but I digress) it's a really amazing, and really enjoyable game! (I for one don't even mind the older graphics, it's a bit endearing to me, eheh. )P.S. I DO prefer the nexon launcher to the steam launcher at times, but they both work wonderfully. It's always a good idea to use both, however, since sometimes one works when the other does not.			"

												I've played this game since I was around 11. Me and a friend were looking for something to play and this was it. We spent hours upon hours running around, doing dungeons, riding ostriches, playing songs, and much more. This game was everything we wanted, no specific way a player should play, many, many quests, and just an open world for you to explore and be with others. The second I hear the theme song I instantly am hit with memories of me and my friend as elves, getting our first pets, fighting boars and just having a good time. I'm not sure how others feel about Mabi, but it just hit home with me, and whenever I want to have a good time with my friend, we always manage to come back to Mabi. :)			"

												I've played this game for nearly seven years now (and only had steam for almost 3) so my hours are actually much greater than what's displayed.  As far as games go, it's open world, the skillsets and classes are open too, no level cap, and much to do outside of everyday grinding.  It's become pay-to-win, but in this kind of game, ""winning"" doesn't really matter, so you have freedom in that aspect.Personally though, I don't have much reason to play anymore as all my friends have moved on to other games.  Playing solo is an option, if you're into that, but you lose out on the core of what a MMORPG is for.			"

												I've played this for to long and I suck at writing reviews on games. The good:-It's F2P but P2W if you have over 1k to drop but I've never seen someone do that.-It'll run on potatos and toaster oven computers, You could probably make some ham with how well it runs.-It came along way back when I use to play it as a kid it has weeky (Daily for newbies) rebirths not how it use to be when you had to wait till you were 18 IG.-Story is good I heard (I never cared for it and only read some)-Combat is pretty simple (Can be good to others bad for some but I like it)-A LOT of events it's pretty rare for there not to be some kind of event going on in mabinogi.-Guilds/Community make the game overall a better experience. (It kept me playing for 3.5k hours rip.)The bad:-Some people in the game can be mean like most other MMO's out there-Market can be... Weird with pricing.-None (To most) of the older clothing in the game has been redone and reworked still having that good o' knife level edges and low resolution textures.-The free hairs just suck.-Mods aren't allowed that make the game run better, however, I do understand why it's not allowed.The ugly:- It's old and the game is **** tier optimized. Not as bad as some games though.-Nothing to really do when you've done everything there is do go do in this game other then to grind for the next nice looking outfit.-Raids need to be improved for dragon raid.

There is a pro to this game tho, what were once premium stuff (like bank space and free stones, newbie benefits, etc.) are now FREE however if you'd like to  create a guild and get a house mainly for selling, you still need VIP (which is $14 a month). But at least you can rebirth for FREE every week.			"

Freely do so!Maybe you just want to be a bard, sitting on the sidelines, playing music for the heck of it, or even playing music to benefit your adventuring team?  You can even make your own music, through the composition skill in which you use the MML format to create the notes.This game is brilliant, and I totally didn't know it was available on Steam.

												For the little time that I played this game, I do have to say. Make sure you have a decent Gaming PC or a Gaming PC that you built on your own. A lot of times I feel as though there are people giving bad reviews on games here who may be trying to play MMORPGs on their run of the mill PC with average (at best) Processors and Graphics cards. You can't just simply jump into a game on a basic PC and expect to have top notch graphics, good game play  and so on. In the small amount of time that I did play this game I did notice a few cons right off the bat, one being that there are Tourtorials for everthing and they don't seem to end. As someone who tries to look at games from two sides I can say that from a gamers stand point this is the most obnoxious thing to deal with in a potentially great game. From a game designers stand point I couldn't imagine making a game that is constantly telling people how to play, and if the game is so difficult that you need tons of tourtorials to explain the game, then you're obviously doing something wrong. A game should pressent challenges that makes it fun, not annoys the crud out of it's Potential fanbase, and I use the word ""potential"" rather loosely here. But like I said before, as a gamer I want a game the brings a challenge, but not in a way where I need tourtorials. I'm going to recommend this game cause from what I have played of it, it was fun. But who ever plays this game after or based off of my review, just know you might find your self getting flustered from time to time.			"

												I enjoyed this game, and am, in fact still playing as I write this. My experience with the MMORPG genre is minimal due to a combination of disliking the pay to play model, the fact that I usually get bored of them fairly easy and the sheer amount of time those games seem to absorb. However, I do love games that allow for customization and are all about lighthearted fun. Mabinogi caught my attention because of this in addition to the fact that it was also free-to-play.So I gave it a shot and I’m still enjoying a good game play experience so far. This game takes place in an anime cartoon setting with surprisingly well-written characters, colorful visuals, and a fun loving community of players that don’t really take anything too seriously. Every character you create starts of as a blank slate from a choice of three races to a variety of age groups. Ageing is a factor in Mabinogi as well as a rebirthing mechanic that if used right can lead to almost limitless leveling, but basically every action you whimsically perform molds your character’s skills, career, event list and in some case your physical traits over time and experimenting with this potential is half-the fun.Gameplay wise, there is almost too much to do.  Explore dungeons, manage property, building a house, discover creatures to tame, finding hidden abilities, starting a guild, guild wars, special story lines and events, craft pretty much anything, manage an in game business, pvp…. etc. I haven’t even seen half of all the craziness that fictional world provides, but like I said I’m a player that appreciates choices and Mabinogi has a ridiculous amount of choices.Mabinogi, as I understand it, is game that has also been around for a good deal of time. So it funs smoothly on most computers people would be using now, making it accessible almost anywhere. So if you are not exactly up to date, don’t want to pour more money into games at the moment, don’t mind the JRPG setting, and are just bored and want to play a game you can just goof off in, then Mabinogi might be worth a try. I certainly thought it was.			"

												The game has a great and immersive story and it really keeps you into it. But the coustomer service is abyssmaly terrible but it is updated constently which is the strongest point in this game. The combat system is great and truly gets you think outside of normal rpg combat.The Dungeons are cookie cutter and the side missions are a bit lack luster. overall you can happily waste away your hours in this game with no regrets that is if you make it past the tutorial phases. you can play for months on end and still have plenty of content. I recommend this game to anyone craving something different also it's well worth the price of $0.00 if i do say so myself!			"

												My friends and I play this all the time. The events in the game are enjoyable and quite challenging sometimes. When you want to get that specific reward in the event, it takes maybe days or hours. But when you finally get the reward, you'll feel relieved!			"

												One of the best Massive Multiplayer Online Games, I have ever played. Great Storyline, Great Music, Excellent Character Customization, Excellent Character Development, Decent Graphics and very Linear Skill System. This game doesnt get updates as much as it use to but let me tell you this game is one of the best there is.			"

												I've been playing Mabinogi for roughly six years, starting just after Closed Beta ended. Over these fine months, the game has grown from a somewhat-playable glitch-fest to a nicely polished MMO. A few of my friends even dubbed Mabinogi ""Runescape done right"".The community involved in Mabinogi is one of the best you could ever get. Most players are friendly, and many are willing to help new players with anything and everything. It does, however, have an odd learning curve.When I started playing, the beginner quests were somewhat lacking, and hard to find. All players will be taken on a ""Generation 1"" quest line, in which they will be introduced to the enormous plot and equally enormous world. Thankfully, they've added a merciful transportation system in the form of moongates and mana tunnels, which used ot only work during the night and day, respectively.Once the player gets through the first three mainsteam quests, they will generally feel quite strong, usually ending up to be around level 300-400 by that time. Levels are handled with a continuous rebirthing system. A play may choose to rebirth into a new life, setting their character's age between 10 and 17, and resetting their level to 1. Their previous skills, stats, titles, and accomplishments are retained, however, effectively increasing a player's ability to level up without losing anything.Skills in Mabinogi are vast, useful, and the main focal point of ""Fantasy Life"". Each skill set is separated into tags ranging from Life Skills to Warrior, and so on. This does not mean you are restricted by their use, either. Effectively, every player can play as any class at any time without the need to change. For instance, in a Warrior's primary slots, he could have a pair of sharp, deadly blades, and in his auxilary slots, a wand and book to increase his magic potential. The game calls this combination 'Spellblade' in the form of a ""Talent Title"". Generally speaking, so long as you train the skills and obtain good equipment, you are able to switch between any fighting style at almost any point of your career. If at any poiunt your are stuck in obtaining or training something, there is a user-run wiki readily available with very few advertisments from J-List.The most common complaint about Mabinogi is that the publisher, Nexon, charges insane bills to those wishing to venture through the cash shop, but the player is never REQUIRED to use it, and why should they? They can get the same, if not, better things by playing the game. Events will generally drop free, usually valuable and strong items that cannot be bought from the shop, or obtained anywhere else. Players will always sell event items they don't want or need. Sometimes DevCat also gives everyone a free month of Premium, or double AP weekends. The advantages of premium don't take away from free users, either. Basically, premium players get cheap items once a week, they get about 10% more EXP, and a bit more inventory space. There's also a daily VIP mission that gives more gold and EXP. The only thing extremely worth paying for are pets, and if a player uses the pets they get from Generation Quests, they won't even need to buy those.In short, Mabinogi is a great game, and surely worth checking out. Nexon has a very minimalist hand in what DevCat does, so that complaint should not be the first thing that comes to mind.			"

												  Good game. Bad Devs. It is fun with friends, It isnt very grind heavy except for skill leveling. Being a bard type character is great since you can make your own music scores, or find your favorite boss theme .midi files and making your very own music scores. This isnt a game for graphic ♥♥♥♥♥s, but if you want a game you can be casual or hardcore with friends this is a good game for that.     Comparing the cash shop to other games, Nexon is a little better in a 1:1,000 ratio as in 1 USD is 1,000 Nx. The gachapon system is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, it may seem tempting but the chances of getting something truly good is all based on RNG or simply how lucky you are. Though costumes and dyes are fair enough prices. a full costume that is on sale for the month of event comes in a all in one package, usually no more than 15 USD. and pets never going over 18 USD as far as i have seen in my years of playing. Best still is they are all unlimited, and never disappear. Pets however do only stay summoned for a set amount of time until the daily renewal.     I'm not going to say don't spend money cause thats the players choice. When i first starte dplaying when i spent money i didn't feel regret, now in the past year or so i hate spending money on somehting i want for my character. Unlike other games i play like Warframe and Elsword.      All in all i would give this game a 8/10, since i still do come back to play it, and make music scores often.			"

												Hmm.. I've been playing since December 10thish? of 2014 lolSo I would say I'm still newish to the game, Mabi is.. Unique, People complain about the glitches, I've always found some of the funniest moments when running into these, most of the time they arent even serious things, for example I once punched my friend through the dunbarton wall during a pvp match it was hilarious, the point being sometimes bugs arent a bad thing.Though ive been playing for about a year and a month or two I've discovered I'm a higher lvl than a bunch of people who've been playing 2-3 years, the lvling curve isn't broken it just requires effort it also helps if you dont wait until lvl 100 to rebirth :PI love the community, the people you can meet can end up being your best friends in the end, I personally try to help any new people I run across and returning players from whenever, It's always fun because helping people gives you something to do, lots of players do the same thing as me and help others which is great to see.Nothings quite like the open class system mabi has, if I want to be a chef and punch some monsters in the mouth as a boxer with tangerine gloves, then I can do it because I want to ! You want to use guns but also stab people with a sword then go for it! (Personally I recommend going warrior first just for the defense/hp boost)PvP.. haha.. -facedesk- PvP can be very very broken, however, again The community! theres certain rules thats always agreed upon before a match begins prohibiting certain skills just for the sheer fact that they are broken, so pvp is fun as long as your fighting a honorable dualer~One of the biggest issues is the lack of ""support"" for like if your account got hacked or your client doesnt work etc..Other that I dont personally have any issues with the game, honestly if you put a little effort into the game you'll understand how to avoid most bugs and most of the bugs you avoid arent even big things ust mostly stuff like walking glitches lol.I only play (Mari) server btw <3			"

												Mabinogi is a fun MMORPG game. I, myself, am not a big fan of MMORPG games really but Nexon's Mabinogi has me obssessed! I've played nearly 400 hours of this game and it doesn't get boring. I find that in a way it's different from other MMORPG games. There's always some type of event going on and the quests are actually pretty fun even though some can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to finish. And getting the titles from Saving The Goddess, Saving Erinn and many more and being able to show it off. Right now I have it as SavSavvy The One who Saved Erinn (or something along the lines of that) You can also join guilds. I am a part of an amazing and funny guild. And my talent is Martial Arts and just got to Senior Fighter earlier today. (: So I highly recommand this to anyone who enjoys such things.			"

												While I may only have a few (lol 2000 more hours off of steam) I used to really like this game, but the biggest problem is as nexon always is, at some point it gets ruined by the terrible pay to win concept. Not in the state of buying gear, but buying items and selling them so you can afford to do anything past a certain point. Unless you are willing to spend countless hours a week to keep up, and farm gold in any way you can you hit a hard wall. I first noticed this around level 1400 and it just gets worse and worse...

												Mabinogi is a game deep to me on so many levels, having played it off and on for roughly 6 years. To this day, it provides an experience no other game can quite capture, though saying that also gives me personal grief. The updates the game has seen in the last few years have not played well to the game's strengths, and have soiled what I once considered a ""historically inspired"" MMO. Up through the first major expansions, the title held true to its Celtic and Irish mythos and assets-- which is bizzare because the art style doesn't inherently lend to that type of setting. True with any MMO, the developers sought to appeal to the playerbase en masse, and tossed aside their creative direction in favor of something more widely appealing (being anime, japanese culture, and straight up crossovers with anime titles). The hay-day of this title persisted up through the 4th generation, just before the expansion involving Iria and additional playable races. The playerbase was not centered in any one area due to convenience, and the content available in-game gave every location significance. I would reccommend this title if you enjoy anime, slow-paced (strategic) combat, and want to take things day-by-day, or if you are looking for an unique MMO experience. That being said, the age of the game is very evident, and the developer has not updated old content. It's very obvious, playing through quests and observing different items in-game what assets are newer and which are older.Pros- dynamic weather- wide variety of in-game activities- thoughtful combat (Mashing buttons WILL kill you.)- aging system/ no level cap/ not pay-to-winCons- infrequent updates/ developer is bad- clashing art directions- graphics have not aged well- combat is buggy - user support is almost nonexistant (I've had tickets sit for months without being reviewed.)

												Don't.Edit:I figure I'd write an actual review for this since I now have 700+ hours invested in this game.Do you want a game where you can become a blacksmith who's also a mage?An archer who just happens to use an oversized lance or a chef who happens to be a scientist?Look no further but be warned: The game is a lot easier compared to when I first joined but that doesn't change the fact you will have a hard time. There is a variety ways of optaining gold but mercy will you still have trouble affording repairs.The game was, and still is, designed to be played with others: You can't really do it alone for the beginning, in fact in the beginning NPCs encourage the player to meet others.That doesn't mean somehow the game becomes easy with more players: Throwing impossible odds at you in the later chapters is pretty much mabs at this point.Now if you're interested thus far you're probably wondering if this is P2W: It's not. I've heard people say this game is P2W but that's not really true, unless you want pets, almost everything else can and will be sold by other players. In fact for 400 hours wasted I didn't pay a cent and I still managed. A lot of the paid stuff isn't even that good, it just looks fancy.You will struggle; you will suffer. You will lose and you will fail so many times but if you keep at it you'll eventually pull through.So in conclusion: Don't.			"

												This game is great rough around the edges but great this game has been around 2003 and still is getting updated and still alot of people play. It's a MMO RPG and you can learn any skills if you try hard enough playing with warrior but still want to have bow magic or alchemy on your side No Problem! you just have to learn the skills and train them. The level up system is like any other train skill kill enemys no problem but there is a rebirth option this allows you to keep you total level this mean you get more ap when you rebirth because leveling up is easyer when you got that nice sword of yours you do keep your hp/mp/sm (health/mana/stamina) and your skills that you trained. the only downside is travel/getting gold now there are ways of getting gold kinda have to work your way up and get more as you go along now for travel if you do most of the starter quests you get a horse and a eagle but they are limited each day when you summon them they have a timer that goes down but can be stopped when you finish summoning them and the time refills every day and the time limit for the horse is around 90 mins and the eagle around 80 mins still plenty of time. There is plenty to see and do there is also life skills mostly such as things as cooking potion making and fishing just a name few of many. There is a problem with the skills if you want to learn all of them your gonna have to take some time and scroll but there are filters to help you pick if it is a life skill or magic or fighting but some skills don't have this filter at the moment but if you like hotkeying then you'll have plenty of time to. There are plenty of quests but some are a little tricky to understand but there is a wiki page for mabinogi (if you need to resort to this) you can sarch up your quest and there is likely plenty of pages from the community and strait from the wiki to help you along. For the players or fanbase most of them are realy nice but some do get into charater or just hard to talk to but this only come time to time for most of the people ive met most of them are nice players. So if you thinking of downloading this game I highly suggest not to do ace but if you think you need some help going into the direction of fighting/life skills then use aces but if you want to spread into many skills and see for your self how you like them i would choose milletian. Over all this game is great if i would to rate it id give it 9/10 for the missing 1 there are bugs that break the flow of the game but mostly doesnt happen such as npcs won't move from there position you can see the npc try to move in a direction but won't move by just teleporting back from where they were and you can walk using the wasd keys but sometimes get trapped when trying to move foward (moslty is dungeons) but other than that the game flows nicely and i highly recommend downloading and give a try p.s. you do need to create a nexon account register with one if you have one if you ever played vindictus or maplestroy and registed with your nexon account you should be good. ALSO if you notice my hours it's because i register with a wrong nexon account so i went in to steam files you can run it from there (mabinogi.exe) all the diffrence is you have to logon every time you get on not that big of a bother to me.

												Mabinogi is a fun game with some anime content events installed (such as Sword Art Online) and the collaboration of the Hatsune Miku event.Advantages: Fun with friends, a large variety of clothes to wear for fashion, MMORPG, very interesting and enjoyable storylines, more updates coming soon and fun events, less hackers, community is very social and friendly, make tons of friends from 4 populated servers.Disadvantages: Massive lag if your computer and internet connection is horrible, very bad servers (tends to dc a lot if hot time is announced), a lot of rubberbanding (you tend to move back and forth), tends to get boring at the start of the game (requires some active friends to keep you playing), if all storyline is completed it tends to get very very boring and making friend from different time zones tends to make it impossible to meet up and chat.

												Mabiongi changes up the standard mmo gameplay quite a bit, and is significantly different from most other ""Asian"" mmo's. The game is quite old though and it really shows in some places more than others. Mabinogi seems to have low population a lot of the time but dont let that stop you from trying it. Mabinogi had a lot to offer in its day but gameplay style and technology seem to have left it behind. If you want to get a taste of a game that changes some things up though you should try Mabinogi.  Mabinogi also has a prequel/ side game called Vindictus. Gameplay there is very different from Mabinogi, but if you are a fan you should give that a look as well. There was also a Mabinogi sequel in development, Mabinogi 2. It has subsequently been canceled.			"

												It's a great game, and it's rightly so. There's really no limit to what you can be, aside from the time you spend. Which comes to one of its hugest downfalls. It will suck your life away harder than World of Warcraft due to the amount of leveling and overleveling, rebirthing, and Ability Points grinding you have to do in order to become a stronger character. If you love grinding, love getting stronger, love pwning things, and having no limits to how you want to play a game, Mabinogi just might be what you're looking for!			"

												Friends, ignore my low hour count on steam. I've invested atleast 5 years into this game in the standalone version.This is a fun wonderful game that I only have good things to say about. The only negative things I'd ever say about Mabinogi were community-based. (E.G. trolls, afkers, bullies - jerks you find in a lot of places)Mabinogi is probably the most diverse anime-themed game I know. With a fantastic gigantic fashion clothing & armor system where you can express yourself in anyway you imagined yourself. The talent, combat, exploration, and life activity skill system is always adjustable to whatever you want & anytime you want. Regardless of whatever you choose to begin as in Mabinogi, you can change anytime during the game and begin working on something else while retaining any experience and skills from the previous class/talents you used. This game is also unique due to the fact that you can use Music Markup Language to write songs in-game and play them in-game on a variety of instruments from the lute to the mandoline to the piano to the electric guitar. It's a fun ride when you're playing it together with friends you know on there. Having a huge friendly community makes the experience inside this game ever better! And it's a shame the community suffered many declines in the past years, but it's being revived in 2016. I've met a lot of friendly people and seen a lot of new beginners finally flowing through the northern towns in the Uladh continent as well as explorers flying throughout Iria again. And I'm glad. This game needs some attention.Haven't given this game a try? It's a fun free-to-play without any attached strings. Only thing essential in the Cash shops are the pets, but new players get permanent flying and ground mountable pets on their first login anyways!So what's the harm in trying? Do it. You might find yourself enjoying it for a week, if not more.			"

  Mabinogi has come along way over the years  Truth is this game is fun, and kinda cutesy.Pros:   +Aging & Rebirth - Be any age from 10 - 25+   +Cute Anime - Self-explainatory   +Truly Class-less leveling system   +In-game Costumes are plentiful   +Now you get more characters (six i believe) and 2 free pets (without inventory slots, but mountable)   +Most things can be bought with play-money (gold)   +Fun - atleast for those who precieve fun as doing their own thing   +Now Races other than humans can get more than 1 free character.   +Accelerated Time(Erinn Time) / Real Time(PDT) Hybird Time System.   +The Game is constantly being actively maintained and updated   +Game has something for everyone - Fashion, Dungeons, Fields, Life Skills, Socializaton,  Poor Chat Moderaton xD   +Events - Always something going on - it's the sugar rush/attendance chart when I wrote this review but it'll be something else when that expires.Cons:   -Although not pay-to-win the game is much more enjoyable if you spend money on it.   -The game can be boring and repeative, especially once you get all the skills you are looking for   -NX or Pon (aka USD) are required for quite a few appearance options (Mostly Bodily; Most clothes can be purchased with gold or won in game).   -The ""Style"" Tab costs 12 Pon a month to unlock or you could subscribe to their VIP and get it for free while THAT subscription is paid (not worth the VIP if you ask me) (For Reference although rarely - you CAN occasionally win Pon from events - beyond that 12 PON for your style will be at a minimal 2000 NX for 20 PON Worth of Real Money Transactions (Ie $2/month USD)   -Objectives in game are alittle unclear at times, and sometimes you have to create your own to suffice the mean time.   -The Game's got a character creation system that screams, ""Don't Delete Characters"" - b'cuz you have to buy ""cards"" which are 1-time use character slots, once you use a card it's ""used up"" and a character takes it's place - however this is a one-way transaction as deleting the character does *not* return the card. However - in their exceedingly stupid wisdom - Nexon has adopted a failsafe that if an account deletes ALL it's characters you recieve 1 free character card to play with. (this does NOT give you your other 5 character slots back from account creation)Misconceptions:     Mabinogi has many misconceptions surrounding itself. Yeah it's more enjoyable if you pay, no it's not pay-to-win.   Yeah the combat system has some elements that are tied into the cashshop but no they really aren't that big a deal.   Yeah everything seems out of reach, but that's part of the fun of collecting, no 2 players have the exact same set of clothes for example.   Another Misconception - Dyes require USD - NO! They require USD to buy the ""Normal(Paletted) Dyes"" (but you can also buy them from other players) but ""Fixed Color/Flashy Dyes"" can easily be obtained via in-game methods.   A real misconception - The game's community sucks; Totally Untrue - The majority of the hell raisers are gone for good, and the remaining players are a friendly and helpful bunch. (note: I only have experiences on Alexina (the most popular server in the US) - I cannot speak for the other servers)   Also allow me to clarify here - The Style Tab is just an option for replacing the visual appearance of your characters model with a different set of armor/clothes than you are wearing; there is also the ""Normal"" Tab which can equip all the same items except for the fact that they are ""really"" there, and not just for show (ie style tab items don't decay or add stats, you CAN wear cute clothes you bought WITHOUT paying real money - they will not be very good for combat though)   And another rumor to be crushed: You can't use the same character to gain every skill - except for racials (of which there may be 6 between all 3 races) totally untrue, it'll just take forever to master them all.Edit: Although I still believe it far too long for them to act, my faith in Nexon's Technical Support hass been restored hence the removal of the con on that effect.

												This is a game I would not recommend to everyone simply because, to same, it may or may not come across as one of those ""pay to win"" games. While some of the items and pets in the premium shop do have some rather powerful capabilities, the absolute strongest equipment and skills are only accessible by actual gameplay. For example, that Thunder Dragon I use for my combat pet/mount starts off with a skill fittingly called Thunder Breath which when you first get this pet deals 200-300 damage per use. However, to make the best of it, you need to level this pet or any other pet like it through actual training, which for this particular pet requires you to level it up to Level 60, in which Thunder Breath then does 1,600-2,400 damage per use. For context, when you first get a pet, they all start at Level 1; you can either bring them with you while fighting mobs OR you can actually play as them to fight mobs to gain experience with.Like I said, even if some of the stuff like what I mentioned above appears pay to win, you still need to put actual effort into even the stuff you pay for in order for it to become a killing machine if you intend to use some of your pets in battles with you and such. Now then, that aside, let me get into another example; the racial transformations, demigod skills, and the brionac. All three of these are stuff that you can absolutely NOT simply buy your way to victory with unlocking these, among other skills I'm not fully aware of that were introduced after these ones. My point is, do not let the cash shop get to you and make your judgment of the game too early before you actually get into the game and play it for yourself to see what it is actually like. It is true, though; some of the pets and other items in the cash shop can be overpowered, but to be perfectly honest, you're more than likely to get mad with the purely cosmetic purchases than the ones that affect actual gameplay.In terms of how you play the game, the game itself is very open ended for how you ultimately want to play. Once per week, you're able to rebirth to reset things like your character's age and level, but your skills and training for them will be intact. When you rebirth, you'll be able to select a talent which for the most part all it does in the long run is give you a 2x training bonus for skills within that talent, but for some skills, you need to have the talent active to learn a certain set of skills related to it. It's not a big annoyance, but I can understand if it does annoy some when you're just getting started. Combat talents give you access to various combat related skills as you'd expect, but life talents give you special perks such as +50% in part-time job gold rewards.As I mentioned, Mabinogi is not a game I'd recommend to everyone, but it is a good game if you're willing to actually give it a chance. I'd say sink about a week into the game to experiment with the gameplay, quests, and skills, and then come up with a decision of your own regarding the game. As somebody who has been with the game since 2009, I've had many ups and downs with the game before, but most of the negatives I've had with the game originally had long since been patched out of the game and things are generally a lot easier nowadays for anything you're desiring to accomplish. Not only that, but the new tutorial questline nowadays also flat up gives you access to free pets that'll make your early playing experience much easier to begin with.The actual game proper has what are the generation quests which for the most part are optional, and primarily for bragging rights because these are by no means easy quests no matter how you choose to approach these quests when you start. When you start off, you're probably not going to be strong enough to even take on the enemies in specific dungeons or missions that are generally weaker than what you'll be facing towards the very end of a given generation. If you want to clear the generation quests at all, it is advised to group up or simply get good at soloing specific quests that won't let you bring a party. As of 2017, activity is pretty low in general for the game's servers, but it's still possible to find a decent party if you go to the party board for help. Perhaps the one thing that might annoy some early players who want to get access to certain items will be the shopkeepers and their general pricing for the items in question; typically it is much easier to obtain certain items through mob hunting or crafting than it is to simply buy something outright. Not only that, but even the manuals for crafting stuff like armor, weapons, or shields, even with their limited uses per manual, can fetch you quite a bit of profit if you know your craft. Not only that, but while learning how to make stuff via crafting does take a while, it's only natural considering crafting in many games does not get you the best stuff as soon as you start the game. Not only that, but key advise when it comes to fishing; some minigames that certain skills have don't need to be interacted with in-order to get a reward from it.For my final verdict, I'd recommend the game from my personal experience; I would advise anybody else who has played for as long as I have to make up their own judgments before they recommend to anybody else this very game. Also, as a word of advice for those starting off who need to level quickly; Rath Royal Castle's first floor hosts a banquet every week on Saturday at 7 PM PST to 8 PM PST. You'll find this place in the city of Tara, which is not very hard to get to once you have the special mount(s) from the tutorial quests. Log in with any character or pet you want to level and keep them logged in for the duration of the event. In terms of how much experience you'll get, if you're at Level 1 with no experience and you attend this event, you'll be Level 40 by the end with approximately 20%-30% experience remaining until Level 41. This may be subject to change if they adjust the experience tables in the future, but it is still useful information to know ahead of time.			"

												A very enjoyable game if you have a lot of time on your hands. Not as easy when you only have a couple of hours every week but still fun. I would like it better if it wasn't mostly focused on fighting, but it makes sense that it is in some ways. It's mostly a game to play if you have friends who play it however because most people tend to stick to groups they know but occasionally you find other people who are pretty cool and you become friends. Overall though it's a good game that has an interesting story and i won't forget about it for a long time to come.			"

												It may look like your average MMORPG, but actually, this one's got a really big difference from pretty much all of it's competitors: ""Classes"" doesn't really exist; you're free to learn skills you want and combine them into your own playstyle. It's pretty much a sandbox MMO where social interactions are encouraged and combat isn't always the main focus. The levelling (and rebirth) system is quite unique in it's genre, along with skills sets. Also, the whole storyline is freaking massive, as expected from a MMO going on since 2004.			"

												Although it is advertised as a free to play game, sometimes I feel like I can't afford to play this game if I did not have the incentive of playing for such a long time.  I would recommend this game as an exploration tour of how different and open-ended this MMORPG compared to others, with its unique leveling system. I however advise not to get too attached to it as a long-term game, due to getting and creating great equipment relies heavily on the cash shop rather then skill and labor (via fine reforges and prenchanted gachapon items.)+ Very Open-Ended Character Customization; you'll be sticking to one character and he'll eventually have every skill.+ Unique Leveling System;  Although it follows traditional leveling; your relative power is based on what skills you invested in. Combined with the ability to reset your level AND keep your skills that you have ranked over time, you will continue to grow and grow.+ Unique Combat System; This is a not a turn-based combat where your stats and gear can save you, but rather skill-based. + Consistent Flow of Events; Rarely you will never see a day in Mabinogi without an in-game event going on, so you can find yourself occupied with something new every week. Great goodies for everybody.+ Aesthethics; You find more then 1000+ types of clothing to decorate how your character will look, and the ability to dye them to the color of what you want.- P2W Cash Shop; The introduction of fine reforges and gachapon (enchanted gear, titles that increase your stats, buff potions, etc) tend to drive competitive PvE'ers away. Maintaining good gear is extremely expensive, but these are fortunately tradable from other players. - Server-sided Issues; This game is very prone to rubberbanding and lagging at times during peak hours.

												Probably the best and one of my favorite games I've ever played. This is a game you can easily (after getting used to it) adjust to your play style. Plenty of 'classes' to choose from that can accomodate every player, plenty of realms and channels if you're shy or gregarious, and not to mention, a wonderful community to play with. I currently have 13 characters on my account (you can have around 300 maximum!).My only suggestion is that you don't download the game from Steam and get it from the official Nexon website instead. The Steam version is outdated, as you can tell from the launcher if you're a veteran, even though you still have access to updates and such. With the Steam version, you'll get a great many bugs, crashes, and a good helping of lag (I couldn't get past the character screen). The Nexon launcher should take care of you just fine, even though you won't get to connect so easily to your friends on Steam.			"

(I've probably spent well over $1000 on this game.)Pets cost real life money.Pets are probably the cheapest way to expand your inventory.Pets are ♥♥♥♥ing adorable so even if you have more than enough you wanna get another one.Did I mention pets?Oh, and Nexon is a bit of a money-♥♥♥♥♥.Nexon is a terrible place to go to for support.

The paid content isnt that op so you cant one hit scrubs with starter equipment... that often. The combat is honestly really fun. The combos are fun to mess around with and the people arent toxic.

												As someone who's played for years, I am very torn between wanting to play this game everyday, but also hating every single aspect of it. Essentially, if you value your life, don't play this. It's an evil machine that tells you of friendships and fortune, and then shoots you directly in the face with a bullet of despair and regret from a 50. Cal.5/10 - If this game were how it was years ago before it met the same fate that ever other game does; that is, becoming a money hole- It'd be a wonderful 8 instead of 5. But it's not.

It's a really fun, lighthearted game and most people are nice and willing to help out new players in quests.  There are a few trolls, but luckily the game has a blacklist option which means that you don't see or hear them, and they can't see or hear you!			"

												I have been playing Mabinogi since its orginal US release back in 2008 so this review is long overdue.If I had to describe Mabinogi in a few words, I have to say that this game has ""LITERALLY EVERYTHING"".  It amazes me that Mabinogi does not have much recognition in the MMORPG world because this game has great potential if it was optimized better with slightly better graphics.  I know not too many people are fond of the ""cute anime"" look and prefer stunning graphics.  If that already deters you from the game, I suggest playing games like Vindictus.  But if you are looking for content with a game that has both aspects of dungeoning and a casual social fantasy life, then I would give Mabinogi a try.===THE SUMMARY===Mabinogi is a VERY customizable game.  You can play any class you want from lance combat, melee, ninja, alchemy, magic, martial arts, music, puppetry, gunner, and a variety of life production skills.  There are tons of different outfits that can all (unless restricted) be customized by your own color dye.  Mabinogi also has a rebirth system that allows your character to rebirth and start over at level 0 but still KEEP your previous life skill ranks.  This prevents players from constantly grinding levels for ability points.  A lot of the environment in the game is interactive.  You can chop trees, gather wool from sheep, harvest crops in the field, fish at the lake, fight field enemies or bosses, etc.  ===HISTORY OF MABI===In the beginning, Mabinogi was actually a very complicated & challenging game.  You had to learn skills through interacting with NPCS and using the right keywords.  A lot of my friends that started Mabinogi with me instantly quit the game because it wasn't your typical ""spam buttons"" type of game.  Mabinogi's combat system required strategy and use something like a rock, paper, scissor effect where certain skills worked better against other skills.  If done properly, you could be untouchable by enemies with your combination of skills, but if you just run in there and mesh buttons, you would die in an instant.  Eventually Mabinogi made the game more friendly and made everything much more easier with extras here and there for new players.  This still required players to use the combat properly but at least they wouldn't die so quickly with a finger flick.  They even improved the game by including detailed tutorials that allow players to learn all of the different types of classes & an altruist system that rewards players for helping newer players.  ===PROS & CONS===Now for the pros and cons, here is what you'll need to know:PROS:*Customization.  From character look, clothes, color, etc.  Most of everyone in Mabinogi will have their own unique look.*Content.  Plenty of quests, dailies, generation storylines, saga storylines, etc.  If you start out in Mabinogi, you will have PLENTY of things to do.  Even if you're a long time player, there are lots of dailies and events in the game to keep you busy.*Class Freedom.  This is not one of those games where you have to worry you will choose a wrong skill tree path.  With Mabinogi's rebirth system, you can literally rank up every skill in this game with time.  You can switch between classes whenever you want because you are not binded to a specific class.  You are just a character learning EVERY type of class skill out there and it's YOUR CHOICE to decide which skill you want to use.*Community & Support Response.  I know most people will not agree with me on this and I've listed this as a con in one of my Mabinogi videos, but it has changed significantly lately.  I want to say that the Mabinogi community has gotten better and people are more helpful than before.  You will still run into stuck up players that ignore you because they're rich or OP or act childish with their own petty in game dramas a girlfriend & boyfriend here or there.  Nexon's support also got a lot better and instead of waiting for weeks on a ticket response, I've gotten my tickets responded as quick as a few days or even the next day.  Again it varies, so it's a BORDERLINE con.CONS:*Cash Shop.  Since this game is free to play, the company has to make their money somehow.  Gachapons & reforges are the most popular sale items in the game.  It benefits most paying players because they can get the latest gears that may or may not be pre-ranked & enchanted or the rarest fashion outfits worth millions of gold.  Everything is RNG so people that spend money on these items may get junk rolls or get rare rolls.  It's a gamble but regardless, those that spend real money in Mabinogi will mostly likely rise up in the game with gold at least.* Poor optimization.  This game uses so much, it's rather ridiculous that players need to have a pretty decent computer in order to run this game.  Many people complain about game crashing, graphics bugging out, disconnections, etc.  *Economy.  Economy is horrendous.  There are items worth a ridiculous amount of gold such as 50 - 100+ millions.  Most new players will see that as an impossible reach and it is if you are new.  Most merchants in the game are also heartless & rude and can be shady at times.  Once Mabinogi releases a better auction system between player items, this may get better, but for now it's a con.===SHOULD I PLAY?===Mabinogi is a decent game for a FREE TO PLAY game.  It's the only game I stuck with for so many years because either I really enjoy the game or I invested way too much time and money to quit.  I've had a few months here and there where I stopped playing Mabinogi to play another game but I would always return back to Mabinogi.  Mostly because the other games I played would always have one or two things missions.  Either it's too combat focused and not enough life skills, or it's got a lot of content but not enough customizations, or it heavily focuses on big groups and can't be solo'd, or it's gender locked and has way too many skill trees. etc.  Mabinogi for me never had that problem.  It has both combat & life skills for the hardcore & casual players, it's got lots of content and lots of customizations, it's got raids for big groups and plenty of missions for solo play, there are no gender locks (though somewhat some race locks on outfits lmao), and of course no skill tree except deciding on whether you want to be a dark knight or paladin.If anything, I would give it a try if any of this interests you.Please also check my Youtube channel at mabiBOBO if you want to stay updated with Mabinogi & learn more about the game.

												My play-time is longer than what's shown on Steam, btw, because I didn't always play this through Steam. Now, let me start by saying that I have a love-hate relationship with this game. My favorite thing about this game, hands-down, is the MML music system (well, the music in general, really). It's why I fell in love with the game years ago, back when it was less frustrating. HOWEVER.This game is highly addictive the longer you've been playing in my opinion, and the forum community 75% of the time is utter crap (it's much less crap in-game, at least in Ruairi). There's better games out there, I'm sure, aside from the obvious case that the MMORPG genre is dying. That's without mentioning all the 'eh' events and cash grabs happening lately. Save yourself the trouble while you still can.One thing I can give the game is that the GMs are semi-active around the forums and have events on both the forums and in-game. The story is pretty good, too, if you can forgive the mistakes here and there, as well as some frustrating gameplay once in a while. Even some people within the forum cesspool can be helpful at times. But I still don't think it's enough to attract *new* players that would stay for the long run. And that's without me mentioning all of the other more important problems, such as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ economy and limited ability to get a lot items unless you're really rich or risk the cash shop. There's lots of neat fashion and combat gear options-- if you've got the time, gold, and even IRL cash if the last two aren't enough.			"

												Mabinogi Has got to be my most memoriable and enjoy mmorpg that ive ever played . Originally i started playing when i was 10 probably back when g3 was already out , i dindt know what i was doing then , came back 2 years later (age 12) when g9 was released and still play it to this day (age 17) where its already at g18 hopefully g19 soon to come. In my years of playing i can simply say that mabi has transformed throughout the years , originally the combat was slower and more strategic and was built towards partying with other players in order to defeat dungeons and shadow missions etc , once combat was overhauled the gameplay moved faster , most ppl missed the old mabi and some probably left but i stayed and grew with the game as well .Id have to say that my favorite aspect of the game is how easily you can get involved with the storyline and how oringinal the quests are , mabi is far from your hack and slash  mmo like wow or ya know games like that its very difficult to get bored in mabi since there is so much to do ... ill list those laterCommunity- im not to sure how the communities are on all server ( i am on Alexina)  but as far as i can see mabis community is very friendly , you can easily get along with most ppl and build long lasting friendships , joining a guild was also one of my best decisions ive made in this game cause without it id have never met the friends i have in mabi now !This game also caters to several different audiences , if you are a pvper , pver , life skiller , or okay for a storyline you will have something to do in mabi !Gameplay - asides from questing and doing the main story generation quests players can run dungeons , shadow missions , theater missions , joust , join the fashion contest , cooking contest , commerce , ferment wine ,raft , hot air baloon , playing the egg guarding mini game , forest of purifaction mini game , and so much more !Many ppl say that this game is practicly a p2p game , sure u can and probably will buy a mount in the future with nx but its honestly not needed these days , b4 a year ago non premium players could not own shops , or have there full bank account open once they passed lvl 30 , now they have access to setting up shops ( or using the shop bag for extra inventory) and all bank space opened for all characters , and u can get a free character of each race if you start of with a human . so lets see if u need inventory ( which you will ) get your 3 characters , so u get 3 bank slots , get shop bags , do g16 for another bag , and complete g18 on all your players for a free pegasus mount that offers alot of space , not to mention alot of events go on that offer free pets !As i mentioned b4 there are alot of events in mabi usually 1 or 2 a month Classes - mabinogi offers the ability to use all forms of classes as well as a rebirth system ( rebirthing allows you to reset your current lvl ( not your total ) and quickly lvl up to gain ap to rank your skills (skills start an novince and go from rank f to A and 9 to 1) so there is no lvl cap , players are also given the ability to chose a talent which is like a class bonus for double skill training as well as stat perks  there is just so much in this game that you'd be crazy to pass it by !The only downsides Mabi  has in my opinion doesnt even have to deal with mabinogi , the company that runs the NA server is called Nexon and they arent the best with customer service respond time , as well as Server lag but thats some we all deal with and u get used to it , seriously give hte game a go you may fall in love with it ! ~ Gregthegreat of AlexinaAlso Mabinogi has probably one of the best wikis for any mmo out there if  you are confused on anything they have the solution !

												To do list in Mabinogi:make friends ✓join a guild ✓master melee combat ✓master magic ✓master cooking x (I burned everything) get killed by a spider ✓get mauled by a bear ✓get married x (single for life :) )confess my love for nao x (she rejected me...)In short, Mabinogi is a fun game with a unique skill system which allows you to become anything you want to be. Even though this game over 8 years old it's still a game that always has me coming back for the new content.  "

 Mabinogi What makes this game unique enough to look past the glaring graphically unoptimized 2004 engine?- Huge storyline and tons of quests- Beautiful (If not highly compressed) music from Devcat- Portrait based conversations that hilariously contrast the 2004 engine- Continual/Occasional updates that do actually improve player QOL- Continual/Occasional revamps, new features and quests- Very unique combat system, imagine rock paper scissors except the rock, paper and scissors are metaphors for hundreds of metaphors abilities- Free to play from the start, pets being the most useful items to buy, and some given away for free- Thousands of items and most of them are dyable- Merchant system and Trading system - No predefined classes! You can choose a talent which increases xp gain for those abilities associated with the talents.- To go with the above, yes! abilities individually rank, similar to how Vindictus is handled. Once you complete objectives associated with each rank and you have gained enough ability points from leveling or completing quests you can advance a rank, making the skill more powerful.- Did I mention there's tons of abilities? Blacksmithing, Tailoring (With minigames), Alchemy, Carpentry, Cooking (again, with minigames), etc- Actually still maintained, there's events almost weekly, each offer custom clothing and gear that may not be available for a long time. - Many more features! As somebody who's not a weeaboo, I seriously recommend this game, I've been playing since Pioneers Of Iria.I play on Alexina, Add me on steam if you are interested in playing.			"

												I do recommend this Mabinogi.  The events are fantastic.  I could play for hours.  There is so much to do there and you can get your friend involved, play a dungeon or 2 or more, although they may hate you afterwords for getting stuck playing the game and not doing anything else with their life, but that's a chance you have to take.  Dungeons are fun.  Pets oh yeah, but you have to purchase with real money. Else you are stuck with getting rid of all your inventory because you have no space.  I'm waiting for the nine Tail fox to come back.  Mabinogi bring the nine tail fox back, please I want one.  All in all a great game.  Love it!!!			"

												This is a fun game to play. It's a good intro to RPGs for kids. But, I can't recommend it. The game gets very tedious. There are soooo many microtransactions. Lots of the gameplay is limited by this. There is a lot of content that is just unreasonable without the microtransactions. It can be a fun game to log in to every once in a blue moon. But it's definitely not a go to kind of everyday game.			"

												I cannot recommend this game with a clear conscience. I simply can't.I've spent a lot of time on this game. 2+ years on it. I don't even know how many hours. I lately came back to it after some odd months of not playing anymore, and was interested in some of the patches. And then I looked on the wiki about some of the new ""character cards"".Ice Spear is a pain. Literally the worst. I've spent along time trying to get it. Ive spent every dollar to my name in game trying to get it, maintaining my character, working so long just to get this thing. And when I turn around, I realize that you can simply buy a character at 2000 total level with Ice spear level 3, AND Thunder level 3, AND Fireball level 3. All skills are a pain to get. A horrible pain. Like, I have spent WEEKS trying to get just one of these skills. Just one. Not even counting all the other skills that you get on this card for absolutely nothing, other than the base price of a simple 24 dollars. I realize Nexon doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everyone in game knows it. We all know they don't care. But I guess it wasn't until I realized how little they cared that it really hit me: I am worth 24 dollars to these people. Less, even; the amount of time needed to get everything on this card is almost double what I've done in 2 years. My entire investment in this game, worth 2+ years and well over 200 dollars on luxuries and stupid other stuff, is worth 24 dollars at the most. 24 real dollars for me, myself. Me. This is my price to Nexon, in exact change. 23 dollars and 90 cents.I was speechless for a long time. And then the anger set in. That knife between my shoulders really smarts.I am going to continue to play this game, because I feel like I have to. I enjoy the game and I've already put so much into it that stopping would be a horrible waste. But for the love of everything good that you hold dear to you, please do not spend money on this game, and please do not start to put time into it. Nexon does not value you and never will. The worst I can do to them for this betrayal against me and all the other customers that have been sinking time and real dollars into them is to write this review and never spend another dime on these capitalist scumbags ever again.Don't play this game. If you haven't already, just don't. Won't take my word for it? Play for free for a while, and just ask around. Play their game; see for yourself how little Nexon cares, and ask yourself if these are the values that you want to support.			"

												I’ve never been able to get the Steam version of this game to work, hence why my steam time is non-existent.That being said, and before I get started, just a quick note: This game CAN be fun, Hell, even now I find myself playing it sometimes.But still... I can’t, in good conscience, recommend it. There’s a reason it’s FREE, after all.Pros:FreeNo combat required to gain experienceTons of different activities you can do, from making clothes, mining, to decorating your home-y space, or going dungeon-ing, etcThe soundtrack is awesomeCons:Lots of the good stuff is locked behind a paywall.  To be expected but that still  doesn’t make it a good thing.  *shrug*A Glitchy, unforgiving mess  (Want to finish your mission?  Too bad.  The door’s glitched.  Have fun doing it all over again.  Oh, hey invisible bandits that the devs still can’t be bothered to fix. Have fun with that.  Oh hey, the game just crashed and now you’re being penalized for it.  Enjoy the profit loss. Hey, don’t you just love it when the enemies can steal from you when they are that far away? Or attack you through walls?  Well, they can. Oh and don’t you just love it when people in your party can steal gold from you with their dolls? Let’s all be thieves. Cheers!)Community is crap  (Sure, it’s nowhere near as bad as WoW’s but it’s STILL crap. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.  Want to enter that dungeon that requires another player?  Only if you bribe them. ^^  Want to get some black dye?  Cough up a million.  Want ANYTHING?  Cough up millions.)  Only play this game if you have friends that do too.The Cooking Mini Game from Hell  (Many a rage-quit to be had.  Fun stuff. Those that have ranked Cooking up to 5 already know what I mean. We got through hell guys.  *highfives* )Very very very grindy  Seriously, If you are not patient, just save yourself time and sanity and avoid this game like the plague.  It’s an MMO so grinding is to be expected, but Mabinogi takes it to stupidly absurd levels.Want to max windmill for the title?  Have fun windmilling 4k+  enemies of various CP levels to death then. (and that’s if you have a combat title that gives you a 2x bonus and have gotten to the max level to BEGIN with ) Yeah, have fun with that. It sucked and it wasn’t even WORTH it.  For bragging rights?  Meh.  Guess so.You will never feel incredibly strong even after months and MONTHS of work.  I speak from experience:  (read: It’s been YEARS)Welp. At least I get to walk around in a penguin costume?  :3 "

												I've been playing Mabinogi since 2009. As a veteran MMO player this game is great. It has a variety of crafting recipes and minigames that is sure to keep you entertained. The combat is fast paced and requires actual skill and knowledge of hotkeys, and is certainly a welcome change to the constant clicking of the mouse. The story is absolutely amazing and grips your attention every second, and the fact thats its been going on since 2008 tells a lot. The amount of items, pets and gear you recieve make it so you can get the full experience of the game without having to pay a penny, no ""exclusive content"" or ""pay to unlock this"", they give you all you need for free. The only negative thing I can say about Mabinogi is that now days, its too easy. The combat is challenging but Nexon and Devicat has made the quests for the story so easy that you will have no problem at all and they shortened them too. Its also way too easy to make gold now. Overall a great game, it will keep you busy but it will get boring after you become a demi-god. You'll know what I mean.			"

												If you've played ArcheAge and aren't satisfied by the lack of content, Mabinogi is for you. In Mabinogi, you could have a farm. You can construct a home in an instance which are called ""Homesteads"". You can do trade-runs (Commerce) for gold and EXP. You can run dungeons and never get bored of the same layout. The make-up of the dungeon is changed every time you enter it. You can quest like any other. There are traditional quests like ""Kill X, Kill Y"" to quests where story is involved. As you progress through the storyline, you can gain the ability to transform and even gain powers of a god! Not a fan of dungeons & questing? You can cook, go fishing, perform alchemy, dig at beaches for gems, blacksmith, weaving wools, hunt for artifacts, explore for treasure, buy a house, get married, and even make your own music. The great thing about this game is that there is NO LEVEL CAP! That's right. No level cap. Of course, you can grind your way to the highest level, but you can undergo a process called ""Rebirth"" which will reset your current level to 1. All progress in leveling is added to the total level. I highly recommend this game! It's worth tossing money into if you are a fan of vanity or want to progress faster. Huge amounts of content. You will never get bored. If you get bored, then you are doing something wrong.			"

												I could say it's a fair game that offers a beautiful flexible combat system. Mabinogi is a fairly old game that manage to keep its beauty of the game. I really enjoyed the music that they has to offer and they allow you to play whatever song that you desires to play. I would recommend to people who are casual or hardcore gamers; it's very flexible when comes to MMO. To be honest, they have one of the nicest communties I've ever encountered; but, it sometime consists with many anime fans which I don't mind.The only issue is that Nexon sometimes ruin the game by adding pointless systems like the pon system.So overall, Mabinogi is extremely flexible when comes to other MMO.

												This game is completely free and while it takes a long time to download, it is very fun and free as you can be anything you want. It doesn't limit you to one class, you can be an archer, magician, lancer, anything while being anything else. You can also customize your style without worrying about stats because armor doesn't help, it is based on your stats. I also like it because you can do a lot of exploration and life skills, such as cooking and tailoring, or even blacksmithing. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a free off the chain game.

												First lets start with the main bad issue: It is very laggy due to the events they keep adding, and now the server overload for adding it to steam. Also, keep in mind that this game is on a custom built engine.Thats really the only complaints I hav.eThe good? Everything else. Variety of Skills (COUNTLESS of skills, each one can be leveled), Countless of customization options for you and your weaponry, A Big but learnable world, .. there's much more that you can do here that you wont be able to do with your typical MMO. This is NOT like other MMO's.And last comment: THIS IS NOT PAY TO WIN. I can not STRESS that. Look at their bloody shop before you make that assumption. Heck, read their VIP service even. There's nothing about it that can boost your abilities. NOTHING. You cant buy gold. you cant buy strength. At the very worst, you can buy EXP buffs that last 10 minutes.			"

												Lv 7.8K Remilia :>Just in case you are wondering, yes. This is the STEAM account of Johan from Ruairi. I've played this game ever since 2008, during Closed Beta testing. In this review, let me summarized for you a short history of Mabinogi.Enjoy!Long before I've started my time in Mabinogi, I enjoyed MMORPGs mainly for the communities within. Many early MMOs tend to have helpful communities, which is why I joined in on this joy ride the moment I knew about it.Mabinogi started off as a simple game of rock, paper and scissors. The three basic combat skill goes with Defense, which blocks normal attack, Smash, which breaks through Defense, and Counter, the skill that allows you to counterattack Smash. The skills are based upon loading time and latency, meaning that if you lag, it is more or so likely that this game will be more difficult for you.The game evolved from simple melee, magic and archery to the wide spectrum of skills you have today; from sharpshooting to even puppetry, where you make use of puppets to fight for you. The community was welcoming in the past, and the game was fresh, being a half-sandbox, half-quest-and-instance based orientated RP. Events were plentiful, and every day would be an interesting experience for all.-----Skills, level and attributes:Mabinogi is a game with endless possibilities. With hundreds of different skills, you have countless ways to combine and make use of the combat technique of your dreams. Feel like being a gunmage? Mabinogi has that. A spellknight? No problem-o! Perhaps you are a fan of Naruto and you would like to use ninjitsu along with puppetry? Mabinogi has it all.It is generally one of the most complex, and yet simple, game I've ever played. Skills are trained based on how much you use them, and sometimes it can be quite a grind. However, ever since the Adventurer's Seal Shop update, players can purchase skill seals every Sunday to help with training on difficult skill ranks.Attributes are mainly gained via levelling up, or ranking of skills. Based off the game's endless possibilities of limitless levels, you can get your character up to insane tiers. For example, the maximum level limit for every ""Life"" is capped at 200, but you can rebirth to reset that back to zero, gaining valuable ability points and keeping all your skills and resources.Levelling in Mabinogi is generally easy for the first few steps in the game. The game labels anyone under the total level of 1,000 as a newbie, thus giving them perks and benefits for new players to try out new skill sets, reset their current skills, and even rebirth once every day (After your 1,000 levels, rebirthing will be capped at once every week unless you have rebirth potions). Leveling allows players to take on more challenging aspects of early game due to the amount of attributes and stats it gives. However, in the late game, levels barely give less than 5 to 10% of your kept statuses, and thus becomes less of an importance.-----Customizability, clothing and fashion:In Mabinogi, you are given a wide range of hairstyles, facial features, and even colors to go along. Being my favourite portion of the game itself, the freedom they give to you as to customize how your character looks, fights and lives is incredible.Ever wondered how old your character is, or how your character might look years down the road? In Mabinogi, characters age once every week and grow in terms of size. From the age of 10, capping out at the height of 17, the game keep tracks of your current age and gives different levelling stats and attributes based on the character's current age.How about eating? Do you enjoy a good roast beef, or perhaps having a beer or two? In Mabinogi, eating food will actually change your appearances. Yes, that means you can become amazingly fat, buff, slim or even slender based upon the food you eat. Each portion of the body is customizable, based upon the sort of food used. Top, which includes the chest (Or breasts, for female characters) and arms. Bottom, which includes the hips, the waist and the legs. Customize your character to the size you love!Not just the fact that you can change your height and size, however. Mabinogi also gives you loads of facial features, hairstyles and colors to create the character you love. This is just a little about the character themselves.What about clothing? In Mabinogi, there are hundreds of clothing available in game in a full spectrum of colors. From light skimpy skirts to full metal body armor, each clothing has a maximum of 3 dyeable slots, giving the player the customizability to make them unique in their own very way.It's a fact that unless two players intentionally dress up the same, it is almost impossible to find two exactly similar characters within Mabinogi. Why not start your fashionogi adventures today?-----Quests, life skills and economyMabinogi works itself along side a full storyline of quests, from fighting monsters to celtic gods. Each quest revealing a little more about the world of Erinn. There are a whole bible of quests for you to go along with, each possibily traversing different worlds and dimensions.Life skills allows players to create pre-determined equipments of their own, from clothing to armor, gloves, boots, hats and even swords and staves, shields, guns and more. There is just countless of things you can find to do in Mabinogi. Feel free to roam and go wild, experience life as never before!Mabinogi, being an open economy, late-stage game has seriously inflated prices. However, in comparison with most of the MMOs of it's age (Mabinogi is 7 years old now), the items are not really THAT expensive. End-game quest grinding gives around 2 million gold per hour, and most of the equipment price range goes from under a million to a twenty, at a most. Unless you are a perfectionist who will aim for the best possible weapons to squeeze for that last ten damage, Mabinogi wouldn't be too hard to get into.-----Actions:Mabinogi also has many ways of levelling up your character. Combat isn't the only way to get good. For example, mining gives EXP, cooking gives EXP, potion making gives EXP... Even merchanting gives you EXP. There are part time jobs given by NPCs for you to gain EXP from and train your skills, so level your character which ever way you want. Dungeon grinding is just the most basic of them all, but that doesn't means much in a world where everything gives you decent EXP.Mabinogi also gives you many different ways to do things. For example, merchanting or bartering would require you to bring products from town to town to sell and make money. Farming requires you to tend to crops. Winemaking allows you to create dank brews and more! The possibilities are endless.-----Of course Mabinogi sounds all dandy and all, however, like all good things goes, there has to be a con that goes along with it. Mabinogi has quite a few cons, and it is important to know what you can do and what you can't do in the game.Latency is a huge issue in Mabinogi. If you lag, it is going to make your experience in the game itself worse. Skills might become unusable. For example, Blaze, which is a skill that makes use of magic being in melee range and has a loading time based on how long and how close you are to the enemy. Lagging in Mabinogi WILL cause ""rubber banding"", a term MMO players use when they jump back in time because of server desync. Several skill sets fail to function at optimum, like archery, gunner and ninjitsu. If you lag, I recommend playing something that gives you a wider range of leniency, like magic, for example.There are more issues, like as with the community and more, however there is a word limit in STEAM, therefore I will cut this review short.The game is good with friends. Know what you want to do, it is a sandbox. Most importantly, have fun!			"

Pros*No Restriction On Skills (train what you want at any time)*Customization is extremly vast (can change the colour of your clothes/armor/weapons)*CORE combat is solid*Story is decent*Community is majority nice*Constant eventsNeutral*The grind is real (that is most mmorpgs anyway)*The cash shop is real (mostly because this game is fueled by consumer purchases atm)*Guilds require premium service to create/maintain (again, fueled by consumer purchases)*Community slowly dwindling awayCons*Even after dungeon rework the game hardly provides an end-game*If you do not have a task to work on or motivation to do said task, game feels extremly shallow*Any combat that isn't the core (melee, range, magic) breaks the game (Mobs are not adjusted to the combat system)*Most clothing / armour have the same stats (only the obviously good equipment have different stats, otherwise choose based on cosmetic appeal)*Some of the constant events are terrible*Updates are as slow as it gets*Runs On A Game Engine Designed in 2003 with no company intention of upgrading the engine (No matter what system you have, you will have fps lag in places)TL;DR (Too Long; Do Read)This game does hold a special place in my childhood. Playing it since closed beta and being one of my first major games that I dedicated time to. There is so much to do and being able to master every single skill is a challenge hardly anyone can accomplish. The fact that the developers (DevCat) and the publishers (Nexon) do not have any intention of reworking this entire game's core system or increasing the frequency of updates makes this game not so appealing. The combat was great at the beginning, but now the additional skills and talents ('classes') against mobs still using the core game's basic combat makes it less fun. The game is constantly plagued with cash shop updates rather than content for everyone, which is fair for a free-to-play game, however not when the game receives one to two major updates a year.Play the game and see if you enjoy it. Do not take it at face value with what you see or hear, but rather from the gameplay you are experiencing. This game, if bought and redeveloped by another company, could of and would of been one of the best mmorpgs ever to exist.			"

However, the controls are difficult to get used to. Unlike most MMORPG, you actually can create unique characters with unique skills and quest lines! The PvP is a matter of skill rather than strength, and gets to become very in-depth. The lore is very interesting as well.			"

												A game that seems amicable at first glance and for the first few weeks of playing soon turned into your personal hell. Mabinogi has a way of looking and feeling amazingly pretty until you start noticing what you've been ignoring. Over the course of six years this game has grown and showed a lot of progress, but at the same time hasn't shown progress where people want it shown. Either abuse your wallet with cosmetic items, pets, and gambling gachapon to amass your pride, or spend year after year working up to a higher place to the point where you feel you're actually good at the game to not feel content because of the amount of time you spent on it with little to show.Pros:- Rebirthing; The ability to reset level and change age after a week, rebirthing will allow you to change your age and level, allowing you accumulate a higher cumulative level, which gives means a lot more points for skills that would normally be limited by a level cap.- Talent System; There is no classes in Mabinogi, only talents. Every rebirth, from creation on you are forced to choose one of seventeen(fc) talents. Choosing a talent will provide bonus experience when training skills of that selected talent, and some offer unique tips and tidbits, like any of the adventure talents will show you locations of smugglers.- The fact that there's so many talents to choose from. There's a lot to do in the game, from being a grandmaster warrior to gaining the highest magic attack, from using alchemy to dual guns. The choice of having puppets to fight for you, or using a ninja star to level the playing field. There are a ton of weapon archetypes, and if you aren't into combat, there are life skill talents such as cooking, blacksmithing, tailoring and adventure. Each of these are a welcome new change when you get tired of the usual.- The community. Say what you will, the community is a positive and negative thing. While there are some people who  are snobby and elitists about fashion or combat, there will always be a few people you can befriend and have a great time with.- Beginner bonuses: This game is a whole lot more friendly to new players than it was when many veterans started playing. From free skill resets to multiple character slots, being under the cumulative level of 1,000 provides a lot of nifty bonuses that surely help out. - Events: Another positive and negative, there are a lot of events. Events, while either tedious or not viable for everyone give opportunity to get some decent items and experience, and most are repeatable within the time frame the event lasts. Most MMOs I've played have advent calenders or double experience events, but Mabinogi provides from role playing dungeon events to daily gathering/tasks to  get good rewards.-Strong Update: While a lot of the problems I wish were solved aren't, the developers aren't stupid. They notice things that many players have issue with, and aim to fix them. Before, inventory was limited to a main 6 x 10 slotted inventory, and eventually if you paid money per month you'd be available to use additional inventory slots. Since, that's become a free service. There are constant updates that help a lot.- Player-Based economy you will see here and in cons. The reason for this is because items are usually a bidding items in trading or selling from player to player, so it's not rare to find someone selling an item you think looks cool for an affordable price.- Free services. While the game has a literal ton of items and pets and advantages you can get from using in real life cash, with a bit of hard work and dedication, you can get a good amount of stuff that will benefit you as much.Cons:- Player Based economy is my biggest issue with the game. While there are good things about it, there's also the fact that not every item is in abundance, and a lot of items wont be cheap. That isn't my issue though, my issue therein lies that players are given too much power in deciding how the economy shifts. Recently, a lot of people have taken to trading in game items for real cash, upwards from fifty to over two hundred dollars. For singular cosmetic items. This is insanely limiting, and not to mention against the terms of service, but little is being done about it.- The cash shop; It doesn't provide many things that completely shift the balance of the game, but there are some things. While you can't outright buy an end-game weapon, you may buy gachapon which offers anywhere from useless common items to rare and near end-game items with a higher grade. There are also pets, which once you have some, feel like a necessity to the game. It boosts overall speed of play as well. Why walk from one area to another when you can just get on your 3x movement speed flying horse and dash through the skies. Pets also sometimes provide a combat bonus of stats after a certain time of being summoned, or AoE attacks on summon or in their skill tab that you won't get otherwise. These save hides, and make the game a /lot/ easier. Most of these items and pets are unobtainable by others means, unless you buy them with gold from other players; and pets are not tradeable(usually).-The voidless gap and journey to end game. For people that are casually playing this, this does not apply to you. After a while, you'll take notice to the difficulties of the game, from Basic to Heroic/Lord/Elite. It's because it's a classless system that viability becomes a problem. Chances are, if you don't stick with your initial combat-oriented talent, you won't be as strong as half the players. While combinations are great in this game, until all used combinations are maxed out, you'll be doing far below normal damage. Stats are also a pain for this. You might reach the level needed for a new difficulty, but stats are a problem. If you choose to be an Archer, chances are your damage will be insanely lacking, and this is because more than half the gainable Dexterity(source of damage for archery) comes from life skills that either you aren't looking at, or do not want to waste time and effort ranking. The only clear answer for this is a recent game mechanic, Reforging which amplifies the ability of your skills and stats on equipment. The problem with this is that the NPC-sellable kit won't make a big difference for you, and the rest of the kits are in the cash shop, as well as not definite. So, even if you do buy from players or the cash shop, there's a chance you'll need anywhere between one and a hundred kits to get the effect you want.- Skills: Other than communication, you'll be spending your time ranking skills. Unlike most games, you don't just level up and spend your points on skills. Skills have requirements in order to be ranked that get tedious as the rank up. The requirements could go from use this skill five times to use this skill five thousand times to rank it. This is why talents are cool, it cuts requirements in half.- Gear and crafting is a pain, if you're used to the usual ""oh cool, boss dropped a rare drop. wooo, enough mats to craft my ultra legacy weapon."" Mabinogi doesn't do that. Most good items are bought with currencies from doing daily quests or through crafting which is rigarous compared to other games where mats are common. Most of the mats needed are scarce and require hard mode dungeons or difficult tasks such as raids.- Performance. The game was released in Korea in 2004. The system is ages old, and no matter how pretty they make it looks, it's easy to notice. From crashes to obscene lag there are a lot of wrongs that can grow to frustrating.All-in-all, this game is a beautiful game, that when played casually can be the most fun you've had in ages, but if you have plans to play more than casually and reach end game, you'll likely just end up frustrating yourself or regretting the time and money you've spend on it when you've lost interest. If you don't mind, and have time, check it out. "

												Its worth a download for the experience, you really have to earn your keep in this game. It is a bit like Dark Souls in the sense that it is hard and a bit unforgiving, but plays like a turn-based hack and slash. Everyone can get any skill, there are no class-limited options, only race-limited options. These race-limited options also come with pros and cons, basically that Giants have the most melee damage at the cost of ranged/magic. Elves have the most magic/ranged bonuses at the cost of melee. Your in-betweener the Human, being the slowest, plenty capable of having the best of both worlds without taking penalty, but not having straight increases like the Elves or Giants may have.Bottom-line, this is a huge world where everyone is equal and we all have to outsmart our enemy.

												This MMO game is one that you'll like if you are a fan of anime because of it's anime based artstyle. Some players do not know how to play the game but that's ok since other players always help them. The players in this community are a lot nicer than most of the Free MMOs that you will find online. The combat system in the game is really unique and features many things other MMORPG's never had. You can even create and play music in this game! And the best part is that you play the game your way. You can play a peaceful gamestyle being a blacksmith, tailor;or go to dungeons with parties and test your skills; and you can just socialize with others. That's what makes this game so popular because you can basically live a virtual fantasy life. I definitely recommend you try this game if you haven't yet!			"

												Mabinogi is a very unique MMO and has came along way since 2008 when it was launched. Originally the game was very small with only a small main quest line and a few dungeons the player could partake in. With that being said it had one unique skill that wasn't introduced to the gaming world till LOTRO and that was the ability to play music and not just any music but what ever you wanted. There's a big difference in the 2 games though, like WoW, LOTRO is a tab targeting combat game were you hit tab and start mashing 1, 2 and 3 when ever they light up. Mabinogi's combat system is more strategy based and not tab targeting at all. When you go into combat you decide which skills to use and if they are going to be effective on your current target. Mabinogi is a very unforgiving game in the sense if you decide to use skills that are not going to be effective or deploy them in a ineffective way then you die and yes there is a death penalty like in most KR/JP RPGs.Mabinogi today has grown huge from the 1 small main story line to 18 very big story lines that completes the last. Outside of the main quests there are things todo ranging from shadow missions to skill based quests. There are so many different things todo in mabi that it will keep you busy for a long time just trying them all out.A few key features are your char isn't given to you, you have to earn what you got. If deciding to make a magi type char don't expect to get all your spells for free and be ready to put in the work to beable to cast those ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; spells, same goes for higher level skills. It a sense of reward when you do get them and you will remember the blood and sweat you put in for it. Music - in mabi allows the player to compose any song they want weather against copyright or not so have a good time and try that out(Iron Man on Lute is amazing)Fantasy Life - If you decide combat isn't your style then there's always crafting and yes you could craft and gain skills from crafting alone with little or no combat.Lots of Events - I'll be the first to rag on Nexon for being the masters of the F2P MMO model but they do well to keep the player entertained with many events that they host ranging from Zombies to taking a spooky walk thru a hunted mansion.Overall it is a F2P game with a cash shop so why not give it a try			"

												This game, is quite unique, I ended up playing this game back when it was first released in closed beta back in 2006/2007 this was a VERY unique game.It's Combat system is unique, it's story is unique and even though it's a Cell Shaded MMORPG it's still very unique in it's own art.The game is very rewarding for both Free to play and Paying Players, and you will find this game to be quite a refreshing and unique experience.(Gosh I'm saying Unique a lot aren't I? )However, This game has suffered SERIOUS reputation damage, the company Nexon doesn't seem to support the servers quite as much as the community demands especially back a few months ago. However I am told they have shaped up quite a bit and are taking the game a lot more seriously.But that is still no excuse for things like, Hackers whom cause gold to be duped, Destroy peoples accounts, take other peoples possesions in a virtual game without the ""Police"" of the game ( I.E. Nexon ) actually doing anything about it. Several Bugs that needed severe fixes never got fixed, Glitches that would ruin your items and prevent you from getting them back, Support Tickets that would go un-answered for MONTHS.It took them over 8 Months to fix a hack that HUNDREDS no, THOUSANDS of people have sent information on. Hell even the hackers themselves sent their files just to taunt them!But that is in the past and unlike some of the others will say about this game, it is a good game and it probably could shine again.. But I fear the worst with the given steam release but I am somewhat hopeful. Maybe things will change and maybe it already has.However I for one will not be returning to it, I've done my time in this game. "

												Mabinogi will always have a spot in my heart. Coming form a 5 year long guild leader who actively purchaced castles to provide affordable housing for players, I had to hang up my dual swords to make room in other activities in my life. Mabinogi is a great experience, and it's heavly depends on the PvE, and Socializing. Just be careful, and remember everyone is different. A lot of people will brush you off with a superiority complex.I wish I could re-live those memories / 10Also Warrning - Nexon Support isn't as sharp as it's compeitors like Trion, Blizzard.			"

												Lets start off on a good note, I love this game, it's my life, the music, the items, and the people i've met, and i still believe that it's the best MMO i've ever played. However, I'm very different than everyone else, especially all this ""Cash Shop"" Stuff i can hear about.I know this may sound dumb, But i would give all my money to play this again, For some reason, my computer can run alot of Triple A games and other beautifully enhanced games like WoW, FFXIV. And those games just don't make me feel invested, so i can safely say that it's very worth it to invest money into a game that's as good as this <3But they don't have what this MMO has, In fact, Nothing close! This MMO is the best thing to play when you wanna relax with friends and explore things together. And if you roll solo, then the game won't penalize you for it, even though i somehow can't play this game on a nice computer, I still give it a 11/10. Good luck out there! <3 "

												Hi everyone,Just to say I was hoping to find SAO, though it turns out there is no such game called SAO.... So ive been looking for something close to it. I found this game here. The few things i dont like about Mabinogi is that it has magic, and the fact that it lags ALL the time. Other then that i really really like this game and recommend it to anyone who likes team work RPG, meeting  nice people, adventure, learning, and reading. Watch the 2 of 3 videos that are working on steam for an insight and check on utube for some other vids on this game. Im certain u will like it. Also if u wantt o join a team that will help u go to http//JungC.ORG "

												For what you can do within this game is great, even for how old it may be. Not only that, but they keep coming up with updates with newer features every so often, and it is a fantasy mmorpg for sure.However, it is probably more worthwhile to play spending quite a few dollars in it, for example: Pets. Pets can not only be a good extention to inventory space, but help in combat. Downside to them, is their spawn time, where its like even older mmo rpg games ive played like Dungeon Siege, where summons have time limits, but Mabinogi's pet time is considerably worse, seeing as how they only have a set time for a full 24 hours and cant be taken out until the next 24 hours.I've spent quite alot of time playing this game, since generation 1 i believe, and have had my ups and downs, but i've definitely enjoyed my time playing mostly, and thats just when I find suitable dungeons for my level and want nice clothing or better gear. I feel this game is a hardcore kind of game, seeing as how it has alot of realistic aspects to it, where if armor being repaired can actually break, and lose durability, which then can also eventually make it un-wearable... but because of that, makes it a challenge, and something to look forward when you get more gold from those few dungeons you ran for hours earlier that day.But if theres anything that really brings down the game, it would probably have to be Nexon. Nexon's support for I think any game, really, ends up being the worst I have probably ever been victim and witness to, seeing as how a ticket for support can be put up for 4 whole years and not once be looked at, while my account being hacked atleast a maximum of 8 times wont even be a care for Nexon it seems, sadly enough, but it could just be me and my friends that have had support issues.Other than that above paragraph, ive had quite a blast meeting people who really gave me the feels, good friends came from this game alone, and I have yet to quit playing it for good.

Battle System( Yes! ): I love this Click-to-hit battle system and have yet to find another MMO that *HAS* this kind of combat system, let alone *lets you play dressup with clothing and face options* IN THE SAME GAMEArt Style( Yes! ): The game is 3D yes, but the assets are a comic-artist's dream, everything looks to be hand drawn, so your avatar ends up looking like an anime character no matter what appearance options you choose. The dressing room supplies you with a catalogue of haristyles, mouths, eyes, and skintones that apper to be straight out of a ""How to draw manga characters"" manual :)Replayability( Meh... ): There are no randomly generated field quests, so there's nothing to sit around and wait for. So the only way to avoid sitting around is to actually get up and run a dungeon or read a Job Board. You will not find quest NPCs out in the middle of nowhere.Promotes group tactics?( NO . ): Almost every quest, and mission in this game is soloable and people would rather run them alone. This game hasn't been an MMO in terms of group-quests in years and does not promote the use of party groups whatsoever in any of its new questlines. There are no group quests outside of events and Campaigns(within reason, hence lacking just enough for me to claim this statement). Quest and Mission rewards do NOT scale based on participation, so having a partner with you has no boost in rewards gained. Because of this, people choose to run everything alone to avoid greifing.Raids?( Meh.. ): There are only 3 raids in this game: Black Dragon, White Dragon, and Girgash. Since Nexon is dumb(to say the least), they release a new Gachapon(web shop item) almost every month containing random rewards that far outclass anything you could craft yourself in-game. This renders the need to participate in Dragon Raids pointless and you will be hard-pressed to find anyone willing to Raid more than once a week(at the time of this review).Crafting?( Meh.. ): Yes there is crafting in this game. The wiki contains a catalogue of every creature in the game that you can possibly fight and they each tend to drop their own exclusive items. This makes crafting quite an adventure on its own, but sadly: The crafting manuals are never updated and almost ALL of the new/event outfits and weaponry aren't craftable. Period. And life skills such as the entire tailoring and blacksmithing category are deprecated and are only useful for the miniscule stats that they give your character. You will probably never need the crafting skills anymore, they're dead.My opinion: Probably the only MMO in existence that is NOT reccomended for loners. Also, the AFK fashion crowd is NOT the minority in this game, it's the majority: so good luck finding active friends that will play when asked			"

												If my hours aren't enough, just try it yourself.If you're gonna freak out over the graphics, go play something next gen instead of complaining about it.Some general tips for starting out are:This game is very different, keep an open mind.The community is AMAZING.  The people are usually really nice compared to a lot of other MMO communities.You ought to play on Alexina, just because that's where everybody is.Don't blow all your money on it like I did, you can get along fine with paying absolutely nothing.When you make your first character, you can select any option for the appearance, but only when you make your first character for the first time.If you haven't tried it, I won't beg you to play it but I think you should.You might like it.You might not.It'll be an experience.Take it for what you will.

												Mabinogi is without a doubt a diamond in the rough.Anime inspired MMORPG's have a stigma of being boring and generic, Mabinogi offers much to break this stigma. At first glance the game looks simple enough though it's not till you've entered the world of Erinn will you truely appreciate the games mechanics. Graphically the game is not anything to marvel at, using the excuse that the game is old and dated does little to soften the blow. I remember playing this in it's early days and even then the graphics weren't up to the top tier MMO's out at the time. That being said the game's graphics are unique enough to not get completely washed away with what is offered today though it is evident that it's graphics won't be a big selling point in whether someone would play this game or not. The sound direction in the game is nice and cheery for the most part. Whilst exploring you won't find many out of place sounds but at times you won't hear anything at all, though that's not a bad thing. By not hearing anything at times you gain a sense of loneliness which inturn brings you to make choices that ultimately benefit your experience. Grouping up with others is where the game truely shines. Being an amazing fighter means little if you have nothing to fight for, Playing beautiful music means little if there is noone to listen to it and the mabinogi experience offers little if one has noone to share it with.Mabinogi was a game I played back in it's first year of release and till this day I have tremendous respect for it. The overall game design works in perfect harmony with the games mechanics and it is evident that the design choices were made with a set goal in mind which I think they accomplished.A small issue I have with Mabinogi isn't an issue with the game itself but with it's steam integration. Unlike some of the other nexon games currently found on the steam F2P section, Mabinogi seems to have the most troubles being integrated with steam. If you want to play the game then I would highly recommending downloading the game directly from it's website which can be found published under Nexon.Mabinogi is one of my favorite MMORPG's of all time, it's unique and very memorable. Anyone who has never played it but has some kind of interest in it should definitely try it out as this game is really an experience to be had and a marvel of excellent game design.			"

												This game was excellent 7 years ago or so. It was enjoyable, simple, it was actually a game. And as it grew and as time went on it really went down hill and they made it too easy. This used to be a game I was guaranteed to enjoy and could always come back to and have fun. Now though I'm really disappointed. It used to be a unique fantasy game, but now it's just...I don't even know. There are random non fantasy elements in here that really make me question where this game is headed other than the MMO graveyard. Why the hell are there motor scooters, electric guitars, and guns in a fantasy MMO? Someone please answer that? And when the hell did it become a P2W? I remember back when the only thing you could buy were dyes for armor and clothing. Now you can buy almost anything. WTF?! I trusted you, Mabi! You've really let me down.			"

												I didn't like this game because I don't think I've even gotten to the full game yet. Steam says I have nearly 7 hours logged in when I truthfully have around 3 . And let that be known that I have 3 hours logged in and I honestly don't know if I've beaten the tutorial. Let me explain. First, there's an optional tutorial. I decided to play it because I'm new to the game and it said there would be a reward provided. It got a little boring so I took a break then got back to it because I feel like they went over a few things that should've been obvious, but whatever. So I beat the ""tutorial"", got my little reward, and went out on an adventure! But apparently I didn't have a class and there were actually more tutorials after the optional tutorial. So I was VERY far from the starting point when I realized this. But nevertheless, I went all the way back, did more tutorial missions, and then I was told to do something called a ""rebirth"". Apparently, this is when you reset your character but keep their same skills. I didn't want to reset my character because I worked pretty hard on the one I was already using. But who cares about my feelings, right? So after I made a new character, I was finally able to choose a class! BUT the class I wanted can only gain skill experience from being in a party. AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO BE IN A PARTY WHEN YOU FIRST PLAY A GAME. BUT I STILL CONTINUED PLAYING. I picked a class I didn't want to be and finally finished the ""tutorial"" this time. Or so I thought. Because right after that, I still had more quests to teach me about the game. And as I saw them stack up on each other, I decided to give in one more time...And the reward for what I hope was the final tutorial mission was a nice, pink dress for my male character. By that point, I just closed my laptop and laid down.			"

												This has to be one of the MOST unique games I've ever played. I haven't played a single game so far that is remotely similar to this game, and I love that about it.Now I know what you're saying: ""This sounds too good to be true"" and well... it is unfortunately.I'll list the pro's and con's for this game:Pros:-Unique combat system, it's not a typical ""click and wait for your character to kill it"" kind of game, there's a stun meter, and it resets depending on how much you hit the opponent, Making mashing away, unless you are higher leveled, useless.-No class system, I swear when I join an mmo, I have a super hard time thinking what class do I want to be, and what if I don't like it later? Well, Mabinogi has a ""skill"" system that gives you stats, instead of having to be limited to certian skills because a class, everyone has skills equally, with the exception of a very few amount of skills (Those skills are locked into race).-Mainstream storyline quests, I will say it, I hate most mmo plots, the characters lack personality, there isn't a feeling of depth within the bosses, and most of the time, you have absolutely no idea what they are talking about, nor do you really CARE. This plot had me paying attention, I won't say it's an amazing plot, but if a plot in an MMO actually manages to have me wondering what will happen next, then I say it's at least decent. The bosses (due to the combat system) really have you feeling like you're facing off against a MENACE. Plus, you know a plot is at least decent when you have players sometimes actually TALK about the plot in the game.-Armor and clothes. Oh God how I hated games that were like ""Wait you want this cool looking armor or that adorable dress you always wanted? LEVEL UP AND GET THERE! Oh what's that? The next armor looks like -bleep-? Well if you wanna be good at the game, you gotta WEAR THAT ONE INSTEAD!"" You can wear ANYTHING at ANY LEVEL. Although the exception is Elves with wearing heavy armor, other than that though, you can wear anything with any level character. Are you a level 1 that so happened to get a rare item that EVERYONE wants? Wear it and be proud!-Pets These things actually HELP YOU in combat.-You don't HAVE to do combat. You don't... and I love that... I mean I still play the combat system, but if that's not your thing and you just want to socialize? Then go ahead! Want to make music for everyone to hear? Compose away! Want to be a farmer? Ee-ai-ee-ai-oh it up!Cons:-Once you have leveled to a certian point, there's nothing to rank anymore, and once that happens, unless you log in just to talk to friends, the game gets boring.... fast... rally fast...-Most amazing armors and clothes in general come from gachapons... which you have to PAYYYYYY for, not only that, you only have a SMALL CHANCE to get the clothes you want...-If you reaaaaally want to be damaging in combat, guess what you gotta do? you gotta PAYYYYYYYYYYYYY for it, just to HOPEFULLY get that equip enhance you wanted.-Appearence changing, if you've got money to spend, this shouldn't be an issue, heck you can change your character's gender if you wanted to (which is free to do). But... you need money to actually CHANGE your appearence. I mean it's good that you are able to change that hairstyle that you hated at first, but most good hairs you have to pay for...-Pets are good, and valuable in storage and combat, but... you need to PAYYYYYY for it...Overall review: Great game- amazing even in my opinion, but it IS owned by Nexon, meaning you gotta have money, and lots of it. If you want to play this game casually and just have fun with it, it shouldn't be a problem that much. If you want to get really damaging or be a fashionista? Gotta have that stash of the cash to be ready to flash.			"

												Let me start by saying this: DO NOT let the anime graphics trick you. Mabinogi is a complex and mature game entrenched in Celtic mythology. I would describe it as a ""sandpark"" because there are many sandbox elements but also many themepark elements. The game somehow found a way to blur the lines of casual and hardcore. I could write a long drawn review, but I will leave it at thisIf you are an anime fan, Play mabinogiIf you like to roleplay play mabinogiIf you like to craft, play mabinogiIf you like to socialize, play mabinogiIf all you care about is how cool your character looks, play mabinogiIf you like exploring the world, play mabinogiIf you played Everquest and ever raided (attempted to kill the ""unkillable"") the sleeper, play mabinogi (There is a white dragon in the game i'd love to see you beat. He is a beast)If you ever played Lord of the Rings Online and used the music system (Mabinogi has a complex music making system with many different instruments. In fact ""Mabinogion"" is collection of Welsh tales based on old Celtic legends and mythology and the word that was used to name the game ""Mabinogi"". Also it is widely known that J.R.R. Tolkein used a lot of Celtic mythology to write LOTR.)If you like to do dungeon runs for rare (and EXTREMELY valuable items in game) play mabinogiIf you like the idea of a classless system (you can be everything eventually.. but it would take years like EvE online) play mabinogiIf you want a character that ages, play mabinogi (1 week in real life ages your character one year in game. The physical changes are noticeable from age 10 to age 25.)You are tired of typical linear MMO's and want a game that lets you express yourself........ PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF MABINOGI.The only person I wouldn't reccomend this game to is PvP'ers. There is open world faction PvP but there is an option to turn it off, which leads to nothing but high powered ganking and no real incentive to pvp, although that may or may not change in the future. Other than that, you will not be disappointed. Mabinogi is what every jaded MMO'er is looking for, they just don't know it yet			"

												Well most games i wouldn't just recommend. Most don't normally catch my eye. This didn't catch my eye, but looked right at it. The reason for reviewing games, books, and movies is to tell how good or how bad they were. Well this one was a good one. i personally likec the experience even though it's not one of my typical games. I may love anime, but their games normally don't catch my eye like this one did. Hey maybe this game isn't your cup of tea and i completely understand that, but trying new things is always pretty nice too. That's all i'm saying.			"

												Can you tell I've wasted my life on this?  Granted a lot of that is AFK time, but it also doesn't count all the time I put in prior to it hooking into Steam.Overview:Graphics: B-. not great even by 2004 standards (when this was released in Korea), but stylized heavily enough that you will still enjoy them from an aesthetic standpoint.Music: A++.  Hanstone is second only to SoundTEMP (putting Mabi second only to RO) in terms of background music.Story: Solid A.  Well made and involved story across 15 full generations released so far over the life of the game.  Solid lore and worldbuilding come together as the plot advances, giving you tidbits of the past (loosely based on Celtic mythology).  A long series of deeply involved quests (none of the MMO standard ""kill tons and tons of X, fetch this, farm that"" junk) leading up to many epic and challenging (unless you bring some powerful friends along) battles and bosses.Combat: A+ Real action combat. Some of the best you will find in an MMORPG.  Entirely unique style (somewhat copied later by SMT: Imagine).  None of that lock and auto WoW clone nonsense.  Simple core mechanics of hitstun and knockdown give weight to everything you do, with just as much emphasis on reacting to the enemy as there is on figuring out how to combo your own skills.  With skilled play, avoiding taking damage entirely is extremely possible.  Combine that core with dozens of skills from a multitude of talents that you can mix and match at will (there are no classes/jobs, learn and train whatever you want) and you end up with limitless possibilities.  There are no forced or defined roles.  Lag CAN be an issue if you are on a bad connection, but most people will be fine.F2P model: Recently upgraded to B+.  All of the core gameplay is now entirely free.  Premium service can be purchased if desired, but it's just some bonus convenience.  Pets can be purchased (and are permanent), in addition to the ones you can earn for free (and the free pegasi for completing the Saga are better than most paid ones).  The closest thing to a pay2win left in are reforges, but the game has a strong economy and those can be easily bought from other players fairly cheap (and not really necessary outside of minmaxing)Overall it gets an A.  Great choice for how to spend your time, and you will spend a LOT of it.Stick around if you are interested, I'll go over some of the key mechanics that differ from other MMOs.Start with the skill and rebirth system.  Every time you level up (or from a few other possible methods) you earn 1 AP (ability point).  You spend these to rank up your skills.  Obviously it's easier to level up when you are a lower level, so once per week you are allowed to (but not forced to) rebirth.  Rebirthing resets your level to 1, and lets you pick an age from 10-17.  Age normally increases by 1 every Saturday, giving you a boost to stats and some AP.  Depending on your age, the stats you gain on levelup will change.  Early on this can make a big difference, so consider picking an age that makes training the stats you use most for combat easier to get.  As you can guess, resetting your level to 1 on rebirth does reset your stats gained from leveling.  However, the main way of gaining stats is not from leveling, but from ranking your skills.  Each rank of a skill comes with certain permanent stat gain that will persist through rebirth.  So, while you may temporarily revert to being weaker, the overall result makes you much stronger.I have mentioned that there are no classes, but every time you rebirth you DO get to pick a talent.  Talents give you double training in a certain set of skills, as well as a small boost to stat gain on levelup relevant to those skills.  You MAY opt to pay for one of the Ace talents, which is simply a set of 3 normal talents at once, along with its 3 ace skills that normally do not receive 2x training from anything.  You can still learn and train any skill in the game regardless of talent, and mix and match as you see fit.  In addition to the various sets of combat and supportive skills, there are life skills.  These vary slightly from other games' crafting in the way they work.  If, for example, you wanted to make a hairband from scratch, you first need to use shearing to collect wool from some sheep, then use weaving to spin the wool into thread, and weave the thread into fabric.  Finally, you can use tailoring to assemble it into the hairband.To rank any skill up, you first need to train it.  The skill will give you a set of conditions to fill that each earn an amount of skill exp.  When you reach 100 or higher, you are then allowed to spend AP to rank the skill up.  This can be a grind, so be prepared for that.  Some skills require you to interact with enemies at a certain combat level.  This is measured by the difference in combat power, a value based on your stats and strongest skills that determines how strong you are and what the relative difficulty of an enemy is.  Train these early.  Later on you can get enchanted gear to reduce your combat power,  but it is best to simply train early while there are plenty of easy to defeat monsters available still rated as much stronger than you.That's the basics for why Mabinogi is a very *different* MMORPG experience than you are probably used to.  Give it a shot.			"

												I know it says that I've only played 2.5 hours in the past week, but that's because I only recently redownloaded it with Steam. I'll make a list of pros / cons towards the end of just me rambling aimlessly about it.I started this game whenever I was in fifth grade--back then, my eyes filled with delight and curiosity whenever anything happened in this game. I was excited, I bought so many pets, and I loved it.It's been so long, and whenever my online college classes picked up, I wanted an MMO that I could play with others. I redownloaded it during August, started playing again. Made a new character. I haven't had as much time recently to play it, but I do still enjoy it, so I decided to download it to Steam and link up my account.Honestly? The development of Mabinogi surprised me. I never expected to see guns or anything else that's there. I never expected to see things like ""Ninja"" or ""Merlin"". Though, I do feel like a lot of parts of it have fallen to the ""purchase for more of the game!!!"" thing, which is a p big disappointment imo, I still personally like it a lot? They've kept the banquet going for ages, and they've even made parts of the game more accessible, it seems. I really like how it's growing.I do admit, the community seems a bit hateful at times--and unless you have a friend or two that you've brought with you, chances are it's going to get pretty lonely, unless you dig that kinda thing (who plays an MMO to be alone? I mean, at times I kinda like the isolation brought on by Vales, or just wandering around the outskirts of Filia (seriously adventure on foot sometimes / camp out at night, it's really surprisingly satisfying, maybe it's just me), but I still like player-to-player interaction!). The ""roleplay"" aspect that was adopted by quite a few players has seemed to drop considerably, and nobody does that anymore, which is definitely a shame, but it's fine I guess?Pros:-Lag isn't too bad. Surprising.-Opportunities for things like free pets.-Currently a ""if you're cumulative level is under 1k you get some rad junk"" thing is going on, and that's neat!-More quests are available; get hella cash, get hella experience.Cons:-I don't see much player-to-player interaction between strangers, unless one has a package to deliver.-Part of the old plot is now gone (well not GONE); the world is post-war for elves / giants (you can no longer tease the guards in the opposing village </3), and the Memory Tower in Filia has fallen.-At times the art style is wonky, especially if you're trying to make your character chubby. Most clothes don't look right after that.-The dye system is still annoying.-Some things are practically impossible to do alone; certain quests that are recommended for a party are extremely difficult to conquer alone (even if you're a high level).I do recommend it, honestly. It might just be nostalgia talking, but.			"

												Let me explain why Nexon is a♥♥♥♥♥♥company at handling their staff members.I am only going to state FACTS, none of them are made up or conspiracy.About Me & MabinogiI've started the game when it came out in Korea.That was approximately 12 years ago.I've played for about 5 years, then got hacked and my account got deleted.So I quit the game, and joined Mabinogi NA about 1 and a half year ago.My IGN is Rixx and I reside in server Alexina.I've helped noob part of the community and angered a lot of greedy, rich players.I've spent over $10,000 USD on Nexon over the last 4 years, I can say I'm a hardcore player.I've been a Mabinogi modder for a long time, and I wouldn't deny that I distributed mods.(All non-game breaking, making simple tasks easier such as enabling hotkey of an item, etc.)Eventually Nexon got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥somehow and banned me.Okay, I'm fine with that. They banned me for something I shouldn't have done.I deserved it.The GMs Think They're Gods.Then when I got unbanned, I stopped making and distributing mods entirely.It seemed all well, then I wake up in the morning and I see that my account has been banned AGAIN.I sent a ticket to Nexon, and in the meantime I go through the live chat and ask for the reason why I'm banned.The GM says he doesn't know, so I just waited patiently for a reply on the ticket.After 3 days or so, some other GM says I'm involved in distribution of mods again.What? I haven't even made any mods since last ban, so why are they banning me now?I asked for evidences, evidences that wouldn't exist because I didn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥And the GM just says ""the status on your account wouldn't let me unban you"" or some crap.I've talked to several people and found out that there's a private Skype chat between the GMs and some players,and one of those players' hobby is to ask GMs to ban players he doesn't like.Sadly I was one of those players who caught the attention of this abuser.What's more is that the GMs set up a group called New Player Ambassador and enlisted these privileged abusers join the group to receive items that are not available in the game by any means.ConclusionI'm not even going to seriously try to get unbanned, because I know these money hungry pigs will simply let me blow more cash on the game and ban me for fun.My point is, their staff members are corrupt and have no standards when it comes to dealing with players.The game itself is great, the staff is what makes the game absolutely trash....TL;DR1. Got banned for distributing mods.2. Got unbanned, stopped distributing mods.3. Got banned again for distributing mods. What? How?			"

												Very good MMO, I give it a 9/10, the only problem is probably a slow start in the game. Combat and movement is very easy to learn and master. It's not a pay to win game, but it is hard to get large amounts of gold (which is good since then not everyone is super rich and has the best equipment in the game). Most of the really good equipment is usually gotten through boss fights, dungeons, and shadow missions: people have incentive in going into them. Guilds are awesome, being able to join a guild and always having other people to do these boss fights, dungeons, and shadow missions with. One suggestion is to make the less flashy classes like warrior to become more flashy, since they do not have any special or cool skills like fighter or mage. I would also like for the dungeons to have better drops or become harder since the really high leveled people in the game can solo it easily. Other then that this game is super fun and cool, the best MMO I've ever played, the graphics are awesome too which is a plus of course!			"

												Mabinogi is unlike any game you could possibly experience, and has been primarily my favorite game (Console or otherwise) for several years now. Even eight years after the game's initial debut, not only has it withstood the test of time, but can directly compete with other ""Innovative"" game ideas. It literally transcends the normal spectrum of MMOs into something far greater.   The leveling system is comprised of your traditional numbered levels, but there is no actual cap for your characters, nor classes. Leveling gets you Ability Points, which you use to rank skills in a very Disgaea inspired fashion (Rank F to Rank 1) Every three weeks you can ""Rebirth"" which will set your level back to 1, while retaining all of the status bonuses and skill ranks you have been achieving through your past lifes. The result is you ARE ALWAYS getting stronger and there is no real endgame.  My own toon is now above total level 7000+ and growing.    Your character from the start can do anything they want from all available playing types. Talents serve as a very loose archetype for your play style, encouraging specialized play without taking away from t heir unique experience. Gameplay demands legitimate skill from it's players; attacks stagger and stun you, knock you down, and prevent you from retaliating. If Rock paper Scissors were turned into an action game, this is roughly what it would look like. All skills have ways to be counterracted, negated, blocked, or even avoided. It is up to the player to learn the complex knockback system to succeed. Even the lowest level fighters can complete endgame content with the right strategies. (It may take hours, but it's possible to not get hit even by the strongest foes in the game if you are really good.)     Quite possibly the best thing about the game however, is that it is not instanced, much like similar action title games like Dragon's Nest or Vindictus. You can explore this great vast world, fight field bosses, perform merchant commerce runs and more, all with your friends or strangers at the drop of a hat. There is a dungeon system catering to high level players and new players alike that is instanced. You can create parties or enter these dungeons yourself with passes you hunt from monsters or chests in the dungeons themselves for OTHER dungeons. There are also Hard Mode versions of each dungeon in the game which provide a greater challenge and better  loot, though a few are unreleased as of now. All in all, I recommend this to anyone who may be tired of cruddy MMOs as a whole. It will change your thoughts on what makes a good game, and good gaming world.			"

												Hey, herostar here. Yes, herostar of alexina, the blue haired gun toting bard of spiral hill.If you know me, then you already know this game is more worth your time, and perhaps a bit of your money, than I can ever recommend. I've played this game for almost 5 years now, my 3rd year milletian title proving this strong. I've collected pets, learned all the skills, met so many wonderful people, and even speak to the community manager through steam (I've got more hours on this game than Sabina, the dedication is Real.)Regardless, I'm gonna give you my review of this game. Hold tight, we got a Lot of points to cover.Let's start with the first impression. Mabinogi is not a hold-your-hand type of game, and you'll get little to no explanation on how things work. This led me to blunder around for nearly a year before I figured out how things worked, and yet, looking back, I still don't think it was a bad experience. The game holds true on it's free to play title, as you can go from 0 to 100% absolutely free. Pets and other things can even be earned in events, and just about every bit of clothing is sold on the market.Combat. Well, it's certainly entertaining. From the unique rock-paper-scizzors approach to some moves, and just how well you can time moves against foes, it's possible to do an entire dungeon or mission without being hit once. The game's combat flows smoothly, giving you time to react to the challenge ahead, and prepare accordingly.Classes: Let me get this out of the way real fast, you are not limited to one class in Any way, shape, or form. You can go from warrior, to mage, to archer, to bard, all in the same week. You can learn every single skill in the game (provided some exceptions with race and the like) all on one character. Infact, I have learned everything an elf can learn ingame!Skills: Now this is a topic I love. First off, every skill is unique. Unique in animation, unique in execution, unique in effect, in damage, what effects it, every skill has it's own specialty to it. Each skill goes from Rank Novice, to Rank 1, minus some that have a rank limit due to there being no more content for that skill. (Yet*) And as an added bonus, the skills also can give, and often do, a variety of stats to increase the power of your character in many different categories.Stats: Oh boy, these things... There are a total of 5 stats, being Strength, Intelligence, Will, Dexterity, and Luck. Each stat effects your skills and other aspects about your characters. Some stats even effect the chances in skills, such as Dexterity effecting Cooking. You can have Rank 1 skills, but if your stats are laking, there's nothing that'll save you from being underpowered. There's also of course, health, mana, defence, protection, magic defence, magic protection, and so many more, but these are all effected by the base 5, as well as certain skills.Community: Sadly lacking. While there is a few good souls left, mabinogi's community has really fallen apart over the years... it makes me sad as a bard to see noone follows Bardic code of Conduct anymore, as simple as those rules are. A tip from a true erinn hero: If you have to mute your game for any reason whatsoever, there's a problem. And with important figures like Tanino being chased off from the game entirely, I truely fear for the worst...Company: Nexon's not perfect, not by the longest shot possible, but it's not the worst. Nexon is doing what they can to keep the game bug free and happy, and you gotta give them credit for where credit is due. That's all I'll say about that, since the less said about their customer service ticket waits, the better.*And finally the best perk: It's constantly being updated and added to. It's always changing, for better or for worse, and so far, I'm enjoying the content they've added. Talents like Ninja, gunslinger, fighter, puppetteer, even the massive list of bard's buffs weren't in the game when I started. But god, do I love that they came <3Overall, mabinogi's a game I grew up with, it's a game that I love and respect like a brother, and even if it might see a downfall, it's still going down as a golden gem in my history books. Overall rating 9/10, I'd recommend this game to everyone who owns a computer.			"

												The first time heard about Mabinogi was in 2009, way back before it was a standalone launcher and not on Steam. I heard it bing a fantasy life game where you could virtually be anything you want, as long as it was reasonable. I thought this game was a big lie, until I tried it.  It was as amazing as they promised it would be, letting you become a musician with a huge amount of string and wind instruments and the ability to write any song!  You could become a chef creating dishes that tasted good with a few tools to help you that kept it easy to do and not so complicated. You could become a warrior, knight, bowman, mage, and fighter, each with its own verstile equipment and skills! The thing that made Mabinogi truly great was the fact that they let you do all this- at the same time. You could eaisly switch off from being a warrior to chef if you had enough AP (ability points). Also the fact that every time your character hit age 20 he/she could rebirth to level 1 again and age 10-17  for free! You wouldnt even lose the skills you learned before rebirth! For all of you wondering right now if this game is great, I say it's probably the best MMO you will play in a long time.Note: This game IS NOT  PTW ( Pay to Win) though it just requires some dedication to get a vast colection of money			"

												Unlike most mmos where the combat is automatic and everybody is wearing the same gear this game allows you to create your own identity of sorts. Not only can you just pick and choose what skills you would like along your journey but you can pick out your own outfit from a large selection of clothes. In this game the battle system is real time and you can be knocked back or even knocked DOWN, same goes for the monsters you fight. You have to be constantly on your toes making combos, it's not that forgiving.We have a large selection of classes that you don't even have to dedicate yourself to as you have the freedom to just expand to any and all at any given time. It's as easy as switching out your weapons from swords to wands. You can dual wield swords with humans or maces with giants. Giants can use 1 hand to wield 2 handed swords normally meant for humans and can also equip a shield with it. Giants can't dual wield 2 handed swords tho.Going back to clothes, you can color your outfits to your liking and you very rarely find people wearing the same stuff as you. When you put on an outfit you're making a statement about yourself and creating your own identity and that is the fun part about clothes.			"

												Mabinogi is truly a different MMORPG. The combat is different and your not stuck to one class (You have access to ALL skills) which creates for something interesting gameplay. You can do random quests, or the story line which goes by Generations in this game, or you could do dungeons. You could play this game without talking to anyone but its way more enjoyable when you interact with other players and makes the game easier at some points. There are mounts and pets in the game; You can 2 free mounts I believe, A horse and an Eagle (for you to fly) other then that you have to pay for them. Yes, I know. At first I was ""Meh.."" about it too. But play the game for about 30+ hours and if you like the game to play it much longer then invest in pets because they are worth it. The world is another great thing about the game. Its huge! Also you can play as a Human, Giant or Elf. Anyways, if your reading this then I highly recommened Mabinogi , I played if over the years and quit multiple times and always keep coming back and just recently got back into realizing it was on steam. Have a good day everyone!			"

												I joined Mabinogi back in 2009 and have loved it ever since. The difference with Mabinogi compared to most MMORPGS is that your character is you life. You dont have to follow the questline instead of fighting, why not cook or commerce? You want to fight using a sword while having a flamethrower strapped to your wrist? Go ahead. Mabinogi is a game where YOU'RE in control. Theres no level cap so you can keep playing and getting stronger and stronger. You even get benifits once your character reaches a cetain level. The story line is catching [Although text heavy] will leave you wanting more and more. The community is one of the best you'll ever meet, don't know what to do or where to go? Simply ask anyone and they'll help. Just play this game its hard to get into but once you understand it you'll have tons of fun with friends.			"

												This is a game where you feel immersed in its world. I have played countless of hours in the amazingly detailed world of Mabinogi. I have 300+ hours on Steam from when I wrote this review but I've played this game before it was even on steam, back in 2009. The world is vast and beautifully made. I have still not visited every destination and I have plans to in the future to do so. The community in this game is outstanding. Never played with such an amazing community. There are many items that you can purchase from other players with an in game economy. Or you can buy some with real money using a gachapon system (Kind of like the Team Fortress 2 crates without the keys). But you honestly don't have to buy any of those cosmetic items to enjoy the game. There are hardly any level up restrictions with no level cap. But levels don't really matter. Its all about the skills. Every time you level you gain a skill point that you can put into the many skills you will get to improve them. Rebirthing to make your level back at 1 is possible every 3 weeks if your character's age is 17. Thats my only problem. That it takes 3 weeks for you to rebirth unless you pay for a weekly rebirth. It is not needed because you will be spending those 3 weeks leveling you character like crazy if you're a beginner. Playing music with in-game instruments is an option using a music language known as MML (Music Macro Language). I would sometimes walk by an amazing composer with an amazing song or even bands that just play music for people's enjoyment. Mabinogi has a very strategic combat system with many different classes to play as. Nexon is constantly updating the game with in game events and even different storylines and generations(quest lines). You will not beat this game in a matter of weeks or maybe even months. I still haven't because of the quantity and quality of this product.  If you enjoy role playing games and MMO's you will enjoy this game. The community in this game is amazing and will make you keep coming back. This is a different kind of MMO. Its unique in its own way.Server: AlexinaIn Game Name: Cloudstride			"

												This is quite possibly my favorite MMORPG.  It's simple but addictive as hell.  I'm hoping that it will become more popular because the channels seem more barren lately.  I've been playing this game off and on since 2009 and there's about 2000 hours unaccounted for by Steam.  I've spent plenty on this game, probably far more than I should have, but it is just too much fun.  Getting with the right group can make or break the experience for you.The game has been streamlined and cuts out a lot of what was there in terms of quest based padding to get some of the earlier quest lines out of the way. I was able to get through the first story (G1) in about a day and G2 is shaping up the same way with G3 not far behind.  I'm hoping that with redoing G2 I'll get another crack at being a Paladin so I can make other skills easier to train.There's always something to do.  There are no set classes so you can be whatever you want.  Any weapons, spell, combat skill, or life skill is available to you with only a handful of abilities segregated for race.  They've made it so that you can spam to Lv1000 and catch up quick and still be a beginnger so that you're not lagging behind the veteran players so far. Earning levels is also much easier for everyone.  Once you hit the Lv1000 and Lv2000 milestones, you can start new characters at those levels and not have to completely start over on another character.  This is a HUGE boon considering that it wasn't like this from the beginning.  There are many more free options to play so you don't even have to pay to get access to most of the options in the game unless it's something extra that you're really looking to get.  Even so, there's generally plenty of spill over from the paying players that the pay items are readily available to free players for in-game gold.  The battle system can leave a little to be desired if you're getting slammed by four or five enemies at once, but if you're in a party it evens out.  I personally really enjoy the life skills because it leads to more business options.  There's a lot of support now that wasn't there before for those who really want to focus on building life skills.  No more are we forced into battle to gain AP in order to build our life skills.  It's wonderful.  It's not for everyone, but it's a second home for me and I love it.  If you're ever on Tarlach server, look me up!			"

												Such an amazing, yet often overlooked game by Nexon & DevCat.There's SO MUCH to do, so many skills, ways to do combat, character customization. It's ridiculous this game isn't more popular. The social aspect of the game is great too! I've made many great friends who I still keep in touch with outside the game. The great part of this game is, you can do EVERYTHING on ONE character! No more multiple characters to play all classes or something like that.While the game is a little dated, expect it to run fine on older & newer computers with no problem. I wish one day there will be a major graphics overhaul and engine updates to make the game better though.Some cons to be wary ofIf you don't find friends to play with, you'll find yourself severely bored and hampered at some parts of the story.Some skills are monsters to rank up.And other things you'd expect of an MMO.

												Mabinogi is an mmorpg with very anime like themes. It has a variable number of classes that you can be and has an interesting set of weapons and skills for each class. The gameplay is like that of many other mmo's yet due to the more anime like style of the game it seems more interesting. This game will get addicting and you will play it nonstop to level and rank your character, but even so the game is very good and catching.			"

												mabinogi is a lighthearted mmo that stands out in the variety of ways you can play be it fighting monsters in the main story or writing music and farming crops. the gsme is very enjoyable and has no shortage of content but suffers from relatively low graphics and difficulty in gaining equipment at least in my experience. this does not cause many problems because of the systems implemented to help beginners and the many events that can give you quite nice items.overall the game serves as a jack of all trades being quite good in all categorries but never perfect and is highly enjoyable for all demographics.

												Hey, herostar here. Yes, herostar of alexina, the blue haired gun toting bard of spiral hill.If you know me, then you already know this game is more worth your time, and perhaps a bit of your money, than I can ever recommend. I've played this game for almost 5 years now, my 3rd year milletian title proving this strong. I've collected pets, learned all the skills, met so many wonderful people, and even speak to the community manager through steam (I've got more hours on this game than Sabina, the dedication is Real.)Regardless, I'm gonna give you my review of this game. Hold tight, we got a Lot of points to cover.Let's start with the first impression. Mabinogi is not a hold-your-hand type of game, and you'll get little to no explanation on how things work. This led me to blunder around for nearly a year before I figured out how things worked, and yet, looking back, I still don't think it was a bad experience. The game holds true on it's free to play title, as you can go from 0 to 100% absolutely free. Pets and other things can even be earned in events, and just about every bit of clothing is sold on the market.Combat. Well, it's certainly entertaining. From the unique rock-paper-scizzors approach to some moves, and just how well you can time moves against foes, it's possible to do an entire dungeon or mission without being hit once. The game's combat flows smoothly, giving you time to react to the challenge ahead, and prepare accordingly.Classes: Let me get this out of the way real fast, you are not limited to one class in Any way, shape, or form. You can go from warrior, to mage, to archer, to bard, all in the same week. You can learn every single skill in the game (provided some exceptions with race and the like) all on one character. Infact, I have learned everything an elf can learn ingame!Skills: Now this is a topic I love. First off, every skill is unique. Unique in animation, unique in execution, unique in effect, in damage, what effects it, every skill has it's own specialty to it. Each skill goes from Rank Novice, to Rank 1, minus some that have a rank limit due to there being no more content for that skill. (Yet*) And as an added bonus, the skills also can give, and often do, a variety of stats to increase the power of your character in many different categories.Stats: Oh boy, these things... There are a total of 5 stats, being Strength, Intelligence, Will, Dexterity, and Luck. Each stat effects your skills and other aspects about your characters. Some stats even effect the chances in skills, such as Dexterity effecting Cooking. You can have Rank 1 skills, but if your stats are laking, there's nothing that'll save you from being underpowered. There's also of course, health, mana, defence, protection, magic defence, magic protection, and so many more, but these are all effected by the base 5, as well as certain skills.Community: Sadly lacking. While there is a few good souls left, mabinogi's community has really fallen apart over the years... it makes me sad as a bard to see noone follows Bardic code of Conduct anymore, as simple as those rules are. A tip from a true erinn hero: If you have to mute your game for any reason whatsoever, there's a problem. And with important figures like Tanino being chased off from the game entirely, I truely fear for the worst...Company: Nexon's not perfect, not by the longest shot possible, but it's not the worst. Nexon is doing what they can to keep the game bug free and happy, and you gotta give them credit for where credit is due. That's all I'll say about that, since the less said about their customer service ticket waits, the better.*And finally the best perk: It's constantly being updated and added to. It's always changing, for better or for worse, and so far, I'm enjoying the content they've added. Talents like Ninja, gunslinger, fighter, puppetteer, even the massive list of bard's buffs weren't in the game when I started. But god, do I love that they came <3Overall, mabinogi's a game I grew up with, it's a game that I love and respect like a brother, and even if it might see a downfall, it's still going down as a golden gem in my history books. Overall rating 9/10, I'd recommend this game to everyone who owns a computer.			"

												I joined Mabinogi back in 2009 and have loved it ever since. The difference with Mabinogi compared to most MMORPGS is that your character is you life. You dont have to follow the questline instead of fighting, why not cook or commerce? You want to fight using a sword while having a flamethrower strapped to your wrist? Go ahead. Mabinogi is a game where YOU'RE in control. Theres no level cap so you can keep playing and getting stronger and stronger. You even get benifits once your character reaches a cetain level. The story line is catching [Although text heavy] will leave you wanting more and more. The community is one of the best you'll ever meet, don't know what to do or where to go? Simply ask anyone and they'll help. Just play this game its hard to get into but once you understand it you'll have tons of fun with friends.			"

Also this game is great for anime fans of sword art online cause it has huge similarites to the anime such as the irl aspects i said before but this game keeps getting bigger and better i rather enjoy this game and with a lot of events going on that means new content.Cons: Bugs(duh), poorly optimized, needs to have a auto-detect for graphics, crashes at times and lag. Also you cannot use razer cortex on this game since hackshield thinks its a hacking software.Over all this is a game that i can keep coming back too.			"

												OH how beautiful this game is. This is the very definition of mmorpg. I'm going to list all the cool stuf then shortly review this so here we go.1-This is not just another copypasta mmo. This is all unique engine. quite frankly the best ive seen in a while.2-You don't have to play every main mission and be all combat. You can play this game as a craftmen. You still get exp and stats for it.3-Story is outstanding. One of it's strong elements of the game. Recomend  ""Vindictus"" the Prequal.4-Tons of class and customisation and no class restriction. you start as regular joe and then just improve stats from leveling skill of class type skills. THe best part of the game.5- DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.I really recomend this game for anyone who want to play something so unique and fresh and want to escape from from the usual WOWcopy pasty stuff out their.The game suffer from a few things just to let you know at first hand.*The game respond like if it was still in alpha,*Bugfix comes almost never sometimes.*The nexon Technitian is a bunch of Flaming monkeys throwing flaming poop at eachother.But after all that i really like this game. i tried allot of free to play mmo and this game just sets in nicely even with all the problem.

												Let's give this another shot without the pointless tangent:This is a Korean MMORPG and everything that might lead you to suspect, by which I mainly mean that sometimes the whole code feels like a house of cards ready to blow up in a storm of bugs and embarassment at seemingly any or no provocation. This is compounded by a proneness to serious lag, which loves to pop up in the middle of combat just to murder your face for trying. Many-to-most features of the game are quite opaque and tricky to understand, and there's a lot of grindy crap. But, uh... Well, I enjoy it. It gets easier to enjoy as you get used to its flaws, I think.The combat would actually be quite fun if only it were less laggy and buggy, as it does at least have a nice weight to it. And then, if you'd rather not fight so much, well, there's just so much to friggin' do in this game. Go into one of many schools of combat if you want, or choose a more peaceful lifestyle of commerce or production, bearing in mind that you'll almost certainly want to be able to hold up in a fight whatever you do. It's a big and engaging world that's fun to just hang around in. The playerbase is... hmm. Well, it's... you can find some good folks, but I'm just glad it's easy to blacklist people. If you end up paying for anything, it will probably be pets, which can serve all kinds of useful functions to include simple combat backup and extra inventory space. You'll want inventory space.Anyway the point is, this is the sort of game where you can lose yourself for a long time if you're not careful. I seem to get a little more lost every time I come back to it. Honestly I'm okay with it. It's impressively far from perfect, but ultimately a good time.			"

												This is a one of a kind game that everyone should give a chance. Mabinogi is a fantasy anime MMORPG with a rich character development system, unique combat system, and a rich story that separates it from other generic MMORPGs. As you dive into the world of Erinn, you can do a variety of things. From fighting monsters, performing quests, and leveling up to fishing, jousting, dressing up, and even playing and composing music. Each time a player gains enough experience from doing these kinds of activities, they will receive an AP (attribute point) that lets them distribute it to any skill and rank it to make them stronger or more efficient. There is a rebirth system where a player can reset their character's level in order to easily acquire more AP. This means that there is an infinite amount of levels so you can create a character that will suit your own play-style. Since the amount of content Mabinogi has to offer, the possibilities are endless. This is a game I can see myself playing for many years.			"

You can use the most tools as weapons, microphone for example. You get a weapon skill depended on the item you use for combat, such as blunt or slice.There are hidden quests, if you tell the right keyword to the right npc.You dont need to buy anything for real money to play.The Inventory becomes little after a while playing because there are so many items to find.

												Mabinogi is probably one of the best MMORPGs you will ever play. It is not a grindfest and you gain your experience in more ways then just fighting monsters. You can choose to pull goods from one town to the next by elephant or cook and play music around the campfire. The game also requires skill. Its far from a button masher. If you are just starting out, its a great time to be a newbie. The game practically caters to them...leaving all the old geezers to rot. I should know I have been playing for over 5 years. Its all about the newbies now! Its also import to know the game is practically a solo now. Partying to accomplish goals is practically obsolete! The only downfall of this amazing game is its host Nexon NA. Nexon NA is probably one of the worst game hosts in existence. But if you can look past the crap they pull on a daily basis, the game is absolutely amazing.			"

												My opinon on this is kind of two sided. I'm sure many people have stated this, but the combat can be not so great at times, however this does not make the combat terrible. I've played many MMOs and have run into some with far worse combat.Mabinogis' combat holds up. The fact that Mabinogi isn't completely combat driven helps that.As far as skills go, theres a lot that will keep you busy. The class system is set in a way that you may have chosen mage, but you can easily learn another classes skills. If it wasn't for that Mabinogi might have been slightly more boring. I know various MMOs have used this same concept, Runescape for example. Back in the day that is what kept me playing that game, and I'm sure this game for just as long, if not longer.Okay now for the community. Like Any MMO there are helpful players, then there are those stuck up players who don't care about you unless you have something they want, or your what they would call ""Strong"". During my first few hours of playing I met this player who was a big help with questing. (Seeing as I for whatever reason couldn't make it through) Most of the community I've met through my experience are nice. (Thats just a personal preference of mine)Overall, I would say if your looking for an MMO that you can invest loads of time into, check out Mabinogi. As long as your into a not so combat driven MMO you should fall in love with it.			"

												The easiest way to describe this game would be 2007 runescape, except with an actual (REALLY REALLY FUN) combat system.Mabinogi doesn't suffer from pay2win as much as most MMOs do. There is a ""reforge"" system, which is the same as maplestory's cube system (use this cash shop only item to give your item random bonuses). But the tools needed for this are tradable, and somewhat cheap in the player market (plus the bonuses are rather low). There's several way to get mounts and AoE stun pets without paying a dime. The only clear cut advantage you can get with real money is rebirthing every week for $10 a week, rather than every 3 (which is probably going to change soon anyway, juding by the updates that the other versions have received).This game's rebirth system means you can play it casually and not fall too far behind those who play it religiously. Someone who plays about 4 hours every 3 weeks will still progress about 25% as fast as the person who grinds to level 200 combat + 30 exploration every rebirth.My one warning to anyone who's trying this game for the first time, or returning, is that the UI is poorly deisgned. It's a mess of buttons, most of which you won't use, as you'll have hotkeys for them memorised. It doesnt' scale well to low resolutions, and will look like an eyesore until you move everything around to where you want it to be. The combat tutorials are also annoyingly long. Once you get past the tutorial and get used to the UI (and outdated graphics), you'll realize how amazing this game can be. I'd personally say this is the best MMO I've ever played.This game also has a very large modding community. Most of which are simple model swaps and sound changes, but there's also ENBs and some clientside script editing.			"

												I been playing Mabinogi since 2009 and I've been addicted to it ever since. Basically Mabinogi is a fast pace combo loco mmorpg with a knockback system. The combat system is unique and very much loved by everyone in its community. I'd say if you want to try this game, first pick the Alexina server, since it has more newbies than the other servers. Try to make friends as soon as possible you'll need all the help you can get. Picking ""Warrior"" as your first talent would be wise and a newbie you want all the strength you can get. Confuse was skill to first rank up? Well let me tell you W-I-N-D-M-I-L-L. That's right get windmill and critical hit to rank 1 first, then do whatever. Oh also refine as soon, since its the only skill that favors the RNG in whole game. By the way Mabinogi has horrible RNG percentage... have fun!			"

												Let's make this review short and sweet. Amazing game with an engaging story (until after generation 12) and fun PVE. PVP is just as fun. The amount of weapons and skills to vary from and quests to do, give a player TONS to do, next to the MASSIVE world made (which no one travels). Cons? The economy as a whole. Almost no one is friendly, or truly at least and the game is completely built around needing gold to people. Yes you need good gear, but crafting is available. Items that're COSMETIC, cost MORE than items that actually are used for combat, so when you try to sell over powered combat items, you won't truly get your monies worth. If you want to play this game, either have a group of friends that already play it a fair amount, or play with friends whom haven't played. Either way, this game isn't all that bad, but should be avoided if you aren't enticed my a rather one sided economy.			"

												A bloody good MMORPG.  Like most, it'll take a bit of grinding to become a full-fledged fun seeking player of Mabinogi-- but the bright side is that there are no class restrictions nor are there any specific ways to approach dungeons and monsters.  That might make it sound like a ""hack-and-slash"" sort of game, however it gives a vast dimension of a ""Fantasy Life"" that fully immerses a player into its weird world of Swords, Dungeons, Dragons, Magic and unique lore!

												Let's give this another shot without the pointless tangent:This is a Korean MMORPG and everything that might lead you to suspect, by which I mainly mean that sometimes the whole code feels like a house of cards ready to blow up in a storm of bugs and embarassment at seemingly any or no provocation. This is compounded by a proneness to serious lag, which loves to pop up in the middle of combat just to murder your face for trying. Many-to-most features of the game are quite opaque and tricky to understand, and there's a lot of grindy crap. But, uh... Well, I enjoy it. It gets easier to enjoy as you get used to its flaws, I think.The combat would actually be quite fun if only it were less laggy and buggy, as it does at least have a nice weight to it. And then, if you'd rather not fight so much, well, there's just so much to friggin' do in this game. Go into one of many schools of combat if you want, or choose a more peaceful lifestyle of commerce or production, bearing in mind that you'll almost certainly want to be able to hold up in a fight whatever you do. It's a big and engaging world that's fun to just hang around in. The playerbase is... hmm. Well, it's... you can find some good folks, but I'm just glad it's easy to blacklist people. If you end up paying for anything, it will probably be pets, which can serve all kinds of useful functions to include simple combat backup and extra inventory space. You'll want inventory space.Anyway the point is, this is the sort of game where you can lose yourself for a long time if you're not careful. I seem to get a little more lost every time I come back to it. Honestly I'm okay with it. It's impressively far from perfect, but ultimately a good time.			"

												Let's make this review short and sweet. Amazing game with an engaging story (until after generation 12) and fun PVE. PVP is just as fun. The amount of weapons and skills to vary from and quests to do, give a player TONS to do, next to the MASSIVE world made (which no one travels). Cons? The economy as a whole. Almost no one is friendly, or truly at least and the game is completely built around needing gold to people. Yes you need good gear, but crafting is available. Items that're COSMETIC, cost MORE than items that actually are used for combat, so when you try to sell over powered combat items, you won't truly get your monies worth. If you want to play this game, either have a group of friends that already play it a fair amount, or play with friends whom haven't played. Either way, this game isn't all that bad, but should be avoided if you aren't enticed my a rather one sided economy.			"

												1.1 hours of making it attempt to work. At first, I got this because a friend was playing it. I went to set it up and never have I ever had such a game react like this. I've got a good computer and this game absolutely refused to run. I managed to get in, log in with the extra account and was forced into making a secondary password. I managed to pick a character (despite only two models of however many there were showing up), got through the introduction and then the game crashed and refused to run after that point, giving me a black screen that I had to Alt-F4 out of. Decided that I'd leave it alone and eventually try again.A couple updates and months later and while it seems to be running better, I can't get into the game because of this required secondary password. I don't know why it says it was ""optional"" on the website but I sure didn't have a choice when I set the account up. I wouldn't be reviewing though if I could actually RESET my secondary password, which the website refuses to do. When I click to reset, it asks if I'm sure (YES) and then it pops up with an error: ""There has been an error with the service. Please try reloading the page."" Exactly how many times do you want me to reload the page? I'm up to around twenty with the same error coming up. If I can get back around it, I'll remove the review but for now, the game is unplayable with a useless website.			"

												The game plays a lot like Ragnarok Online, which plays a lot like Diablo, which plays a lot like a number of old SSI computer games. Move the mouse, click the enemy, kick its♥♥♥♥♥ and repeat until you die of old age or kill yourself.You can go fishing to raise your dexterity, but it takes about 9,000 years before you can go up a rank in it. The game revolves around training your skills, then spending AP to raise them. The more you do it, the harder and harder (Read: More money you spend) it gets to actually raise it, and it will cost moar AP.With a name like Fantasy Life going for it, you can bet that people do treat it like it is their only life. You can make an ugly female character and buy a maid outfit and learn how to cook and pretend you are an actual anime woman! You can buy an explorers outfit and grind exploration levels (Which reset every time you rebirth, meaning you have to keep doing boring quests over and over again)It's full of incredible amounts of busy-work that you just don't want to do. If you're not leveling, you're probably grinding for materials that go for absurd amounts on the in-game market. NPCs don't give you squat if you sell anything to them, so don't bother. But the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will turn around and overprice certain items regardless. If not that, you're probably trying to gain proficiency on your weapon. You don't just go to a blacksmith and tell someone to upgrade your weapon, it doesn't work like that. You have to beat up enemies with it and get points on the weapon, THEN you can upgrade it. It costs tons of gold and tons of points just to get one upgrade too, and if you don't do it you will insta-fail.Not only that, you have to worry about the repairing of these said weapons. If you want to try and keep your weapons in tip top shape, you have to shell out so much cash you'll probably end up buying some gold from Chinese Gold Farmers to make ends meet. All blacksmiths except one have a repair rate of 96% or lower. The one with 98% charges unbelievable rates for just one point of repair, the kind of rates that would make even Bill Gates think twice.The monotony doesn't end there. Not only does it take a few years of dedicated game play and credit card swiping to get anywhere in this game, you also have to worry about a broken e-Conomy that overprices ugly clothes that were released on old events because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s think it's ""retro"". There are even dyes that have flashing properties, when applied to clothes they flash between colors and give epileptics one hell of a seizure and hurt the eyes of those healthy. People literally ♥♥♥♥♥ out for these in order to act cool among the other trash that plays this game. It's all about getting the prettiest clothes made for youtl;dr, this game is boring.			"

												A free MMO with an anime art style, storyline, and fighting system. There is a lot to this game, but ultimately, it's a game with so much you can become, so much you can collect, so much awesome for you to achieve, but only if you sell your soul to it. Most of the game revolves on making yourself LOOK cool, with special clothing, pointless weapons, micro-transactions from hell, etc. It dangles skills, weapons, armor, trinkets, and whatever neat stuff in front of your face saying ""Hey, this stuff exists! And you can get it! But only if you spend 300 hours grinding the same action over and over again!""This game is also very buggy, both for and against you. It can be VERY unforgiving in certain missions, making you start completely over if you fail. The in-game store for micro-transactions has some items that help you quite a bit in surviving, but your spending can quickly add up if you aren't careful.However, if you DO put enough effort into it, you can get a lot of really cool stuff. And I do mean A LOT. They do a good job rewarding you, even though it often feels like you will never make it. Also, the community is surprisingly helpful. There are rarely people that exist just to give you a hard time, and most people will help you if you ask for it. And playing this game with a friend can make for some really fun adventures.I recommend this game to people with a lot of time on their hands, and not an extremely critical way of looking at games. It can be very enjoyable, but it will eat away at your soul if you let it.			"

												Dear god, where to begin with this crap fest of a game. First off, it's extremely heavy on your computer. Nexon could have fixed this years ago but they've been busy adding too much new stuff that costs either actual money or about 20m ig gold. I've only played for about two years, but I finally quit a couple days ago. The GMs are very biased and show favoritism towards friends; there's even rumors of the CM giving the rarest sword in the game to a friend of a friend for free. The storyline is decent, g19/g20 were my favorites, but hardly anyone actually plays the game. The game is almost completely dead, and those who still play (at least in Tarlach) just afk all day selling things from gacha for insane prices. Again, only playing on Tarlach, I might be biased, but the community is terrible. There's so much drama between guilds or just a couple people. Half the people, when they actually aren't afk, are total jerks. The other half are cancerous as h e l l. I will admit I've made several of friends on it, I wouldn't even be dating my boyfriend if I hadn't played it, but it's getting worse and worse every month. Save your computer, save your time, save your money, and don't play this game.			"

												Pros-Unique Gameplay-Nonlinear Progression-Many different ways to spend one's time in game-Average communityCons-Nexon-Servers tend to be unstable at times. Makes certian skills & skill sets non-viable.-PVP is fun, but has to be balanced by player-made rules. -Many quests & events are incredibly vague. You must use the wiki for this game.-Mainstream quest lines & lore are confusing as heck. -Nexon continues to release more powerful cash shop itmes. You will likely spend at least the same amount of money you would on a subscription-based on them. If you're not a careful spender, possibly more.  -Client-sided lag even on the strongest of machines. Variable (Depends on your personal tastes)-Cell shaded anime-style graphics.-Soundtrack -Nearly infinite progression (Been playing for almost three years and I'm still nowhere near what I want.)-Hilarious additions to the game that make no sense (Lightsabers, Guns, & Scooters in a medival fantasy-style world.)One thing to note is that this game will probably ruin you for other MMOs, if you play it for too long. Point & Click will feel too dull, and anything strictly action based will feel awkward. I really wish there were more games like this, because Nexon & devCat don't seem to know how the heck to balance it.			"

												What can I say about this game? It's repetitive, boring, ugly, has a terrible community, and makes you feel like you're in purgatory. It's managed by Nexon, one of if not the absolute worst MMO conglomerates in the business. It's a time sink that leaves you sitting in town squares rather than fighting because fighting for more than an hour or two is an Olympic test of patience and fortitude. I have many hours on Steam, but I barely play it anymore. Before the Steam release, I sank 20,000-30,000 hours and upward of $300 in rebirths into a character, which got deleted by a hacker while I was taking a long break from the game. Did Nexon compensate me? No. Did they have so much as the decency to respond to my ticket? No. Seriously, why are you even looking at this game? Go play something good. Unfortunately I'm cursed by a history with this game, so I've yet to be able to fully shake it. People keep drawing me back in. Now I get why people keep playing♥♥♥♥♥♥like Runescape. Just get away while you can. I could've done so much more in life with the time I wasted on this unfulfilling, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.			"

												I highly recommend you don't play this game.Not because the game has nothing to do or because of the company, I say not to play this game because of the community.The community in this game is terrible and uninviting to new players.They constantly use eachother and you and then claim to be your friend.They never help anyone but themselves with quests or what have you need help with.If you choose either side in the whole Elf vs. Giant thing an entire half of any server will insantly hate you.This game also destroys friendships you may have in the real world.

Just kidding. So yeah, this is a pretty interesting game with some cool mechanics, which sets it apart from other MMORPG's. I haven't played much, but I got some good first impressions. It isn't too heavy on required specs and should run fine on most PC's. The combat is very different, but execcuted well, in my opinion. There's plenty to do besides fighting, so this adds to the experience. I'd recommend this to any newcomers to MMO's or anyone that has been playing them for years. And it's free. So go do it. (This review was based around the time I last played, which was the summer of last year. Going to reinstall soon.)			"

												Probably had over 3000+ hours in this game, didn't play it on Steam. Very addictive, very fun. Fashionogi is end game. Slowly takes over real life until you are truly living the fantasy life. Literally ruined my real life 10/10 uninstalled, will never play again. The memories are both good and bad, but seriously don't do it. As fun and addicting a game this is, it's probably not worth it in the end. Also, it's severely dated now as it was released in NA in 2008.			"

												I've got over 1000 hours on this game (not on Steam, but y'know), so I decided to finally write my review.Well, to start off, Mabinogi is a great game. It's fun, addictive, and anime-styled. It plays well for the most part, save for some server lag in certain areas.The other players are pretty friendly.Mabinogi, in my opinion, is more fun playing with other people rather than on its own all the time.Quests are optional, you're not forced to do them whenever. There's lots of combat skills and then some ""life skills"" which are non-combat like cooking, blacksmithing, etc.Most events are fun and often give free stuff which is amazing!Not pay-to-win, but pay-to-look-good, I guess is how I'd describe it.The music is pretty great, gets repetitive after a while, though.The pets are cute, too!PVP is optional, so if you don't like it, you can just turn it off!You're not forced into just one class, you can be all of them if you want.Updating skills gets a little difficult if you don't have the AP for it.Aside from that,8/10 is my rating!

Servers are♥♥♥♥♥ It took me ten minutes to figure out where the hell the menu and options were because it's so damn hard to see. Most things about this game is boring. the game itself starts out loud as hell (and the menu and options problem doesn't help). The UI is cluttered with so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in the beggining it's hard to figure out what the hell is going on.Notable information: The soundtrack (as I said before) is agonizingly bad; it's best to just mute it and play your own music. The customization options are actually so good, I'd like to see more games with that kind of variety. Progression is really easy. Combat is a mess of clicking and hoping something happens. The game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥even on the highest graphic settings, but I'll give that a pass since the game is pretty old. Nothing really makes sense in the game when you first start it, it'll throw you in and it may take you an hour or two (that I didn't bother to spend) to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening. You won't enjoy this game unless you're the following: Easy to impress, a small child, never played any MMORPG before in your entire life, a diehard fan of this game, very very intoxicated.Conclusion: This game is garbage, not complete garbage, but pretty bad. I would not reccomend this game to anyone (unless they're what I said before). There's a reason I don't have a lot of time on record with this game, which I've played before it came to Steam. All in all, you can try it, it's free, but don't put money into it; it's not even worth it.			"

												Great game. A True Free To Play Game allowing you to get all the stuff from weapons to gear using in game currency only. Tons of customization(Optional). Summonable Pets(Animals) to Partners(Humans) with free pets from many great events. The best part you aren't stuck in a single class instead can easily change gear to use magic, alchemy, melee, and fighter skills allowing you to change your gameplay style easily and enjoying it all.

You get to pick between various different talents so you can get better at the skills within that talent, while being able to still rank skills of different talents, the community is very friendly, and both the Mainstream and Sidequests are very fun.

												Installed it, tried to play, uninstalled it. I played this game back in 2012. Forgot why I left, decided I would try it on steam. It remembers my old email addy so I'm suck with one character I don't want to use. So I delete that character and have to wait until tomorrow to make a new one, then read I have to erase my pet card too or something then BAM I remember why I stopped playing in 2012. This game is mired in microtransaction hell! Gimmicky easy to detect cash grabs befor I even played and I'm sure microtransactions that sneak up on you later. So I guess it could be a fun game, and sincerely toss out my review since I never actually got to play befor being hit with paywall, but that's truly the reason I quit.			"

I am bored of it, and they bring back old events every year there's ever so rarely a ""new"" event it's mostly old events that get a little revamp to be a little different, GMs don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥to help you out, GMs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, there's not a lot of good GMs, but that can be in any game.Pros there's not a lot:Gameplay is simple and easy to get into.Friends that you can makethat's all I can think of.Cons:Playerbase is mostly trolls, and pervers (that's just what I ran into it wasn't always that there used to be really cool people on here back when I first joined now it's like a bunch of little kids on here and it ruins the playerbase I joined like 10 years ago and there was a looot of helpful people back then, I quit for about a year and half came back, quit and came back a few times and when I came back like 2 years ago it's playerbase was shot, gameplay was boring.)GMs, don't help out much when you need themthere's a lot of scammers on here.Gameplay is boring after a while.Dungeons are boring after a whileShadow missions get boring after 100s of runs of themEvents are old reruns with little changes to them to make them ""new""Their getting rid of EvG and ruining the PvP experience.Forum is not helpful when you encounter a problem it's like you have to describe detail for detail what happened like what exact minute and second you encountered the problem.they still haven't made it so people on windows 10 can play windows 10 players have to use a work around.That's my review for now untill they make some drastic changes my review will remain the same.Rating 2.5/10			"

There are no bots on Mabi 'cause Mabi is cool like that and theres plenty of storyline to follow so you never get bored.What I love most about it is that once you choose a ""class"", you arn't limited to just those skills. You just get bonus skill training in that area and are still free to train any other skills. Overall it has way more pro's than con's and it's deffinitely worth downloading.			"

												Mabinogi is a Korean MMORPG brought over to the states (and other places) by Nexon. It provides a unique gamplay experience and is constantly adding new content. The gameplay is simple enough for casual players, yet has a number of facets that can make it complex if that's your thing. It's also not a huge hardware drain, and can be run on stuff as old as Windows ME if your specs are good enough (Although I personally suggest nothing older than XP).			"

												If you are into MMO's, this game is for you. It's very dynamic with its skills and there is so much to do. There are no bots on Mabi 'cause Mabi is cool like that and theres plenty of storyline to follow so you never get bored.What I love most about it is that once you choose a ""class"", you arn't limited to just those skills. You just get bonus skill training in that area and are still free to train any other skills. Overall it has way more pro's than con's and it's deffinitely worth downloading.			"

												Despite it's really outdated graphics, it remains my favourite MMORPGs of all time after over 5 years of playing. The seemingly endless amounts of content, good storyline, and attention to detail makes up for the lack of great graphics. There's also a good sense of a helpful community in the game that are often missing in MMOs that are lost in pure competitiveness. Mabinogi is one of the few MMOs that lets you take it easy when you feel like it; you aren't pressured to grind, you can focus on training more than one group of skills at a time, or just talk and have good times with friends.

												Mabinogi was the second MMO I have ever played before -Years ago- And I have yet to find a reason not to stop playing it. The fact that you don't need to do the same thing over and over like other MMO's, you can do a lot of other things beside dungeons. You can farm, have a life style of a chef and be who you want to be in the game. I think everyone should give it a try before they find it 'boring'.			"

												Mabinogi is definitely one of the most interesting kinds of MMORPG's I've ever played. It's packed with things to do both combat and non combat related. The community is great depending on what server you're on (I'd suggest Alexina if you're a beginner) and is truly one of Nexon's crown jewels in the F2P Market that holds up with new content even after 6 YEARS. The style is friendly, warm and inviting. The music is also calm and relaxing in my oppinion. The skills are a point and click with a skill hot bar system which may turn off some people if they're tired of that kinda thing like I was, but the combat animation looks so cool I barely cared at all plus some skills require you to press buttons like the martial artist talent which I found pretty sweet. However I must explain the cons, The game's Rebirth System maybe confusing to some people. Basically it's the system that replaces traditional ""Level Up, Up a few of your skills"". Mabinogi has a ranking system with each and every skill and you rank up these skills by spending a certain amount of ""AP"" which you get by Leveling Up and Doing quests that reward AP. So for those that feel at one point that they need to get more AP they're free to ""Rebirth"" which means resetting back to Level 1, BUT you keep all of your skill ranks so you're able to increase them further by leveling up. (NOTE: LEVEL UP YOUR WINDMILL SKILL FIRST, IT WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO LATER ON) Next on the Con List is the steam version..I've ran into so many problems with the steam version that I just up and decided to un-install everything and re-install it from the actual site. In fact you'll probably get the best performance from just installing it from the website. Last on the con list is Nexon, Now I do love some of their games but I dislike their company mainly for my poor experience in Customer Support. I don't know about you but I expect AT LEAST average to good customer support whenever my money is being put into a company (You can purchase additional content not required by the game in the Nexon Cash Shop for Character Customization, Different mounts, and Pets). Nexon's customer support is poor, so poor that it's almost insulting so buyer beware. So in short, I do recommend this game just not the Steam Version :/			"

It's fun, though, and there is a lot of customization available. Your character path isn't extremely limited to one class or playstyle, so you can pretty much just wander around and do whatever.			"

												Mabi's one of the few mmo's I keep going back to. Combat is not terribly complicated, but it beats standing in place and spamming abilities on a hotbar. There's also tons of stuff to do outside of combat now, and learning skills is easier than when it was first released in the states. The greatest flaw in this game is the cash shop, as it gives paying players a clear advantage in-game (for example, one can purchase pets/mounts that grant additional inventory space as well as items that reset points spent on skills).

												Honestly this game, has changed a lot over the years... Some changes good and some pretty bad... ;;  If you've never tried Mabinogi befor, it's an interesting game to pick up and play with your friends. This game has a lot of story elements, that is tied with plenty of social interaction with other players. Once a huge hit when it was first released to English speaking shores, but now slowly dieing off into history. The graphics are now dated, the engine... Surely, and the players of old have come and gone. The thought of a sequel or a spiritual successor is unknown to me. But if this game was rebooted, then it may have a brighter future. Sure there is Vindictus, aka ""Mabinogi Hero's"". But it's not a Mabinogi where the cute graphical art style stood supreme and friends were your best and loyal comrades that help you out when you need them most. Not many games of today are focusing on R and R to just sit around a campfire and chat these days and tell stories... Play this game if you're interested, but sure it's not going to compare well with titles of tommorow, but it has some charm. Old and New gamers alike still could say, this was a good game for its time. But now, unless you have a friend on hand... Well. It's not a very good game by itself anymore... It's really getting to the point of extinction.			"

												Mabinogi is a great game except, It takes a while to get a small understanding of what you need to do. My suggestion to any one new! Go to the mabiwiki website and make a friend on the game if you can. Don't be noobie and beg for peoples help, but start a regulare conversation and get to know them. It's not too bad once you get moving through the quest and levels and achieve new abilitys. It's worth a try. P.S. Start with a human, you get a free elve and giant if you make a human. (quest)P.S.S. Tarlach server isn't too crowded so try that server to avoid too much lag.			"

Its a really fun game but they could add another game other then mafa? that would be awesome! maybe they could add hide and seek? mini games? racing? id love that!

												Mabinogi is an intriguing game in some ways, and an extremely frustrating one in others. I'll break it down for simplicity's sake.Pros: - The graphics, while simple, are clean and polished. If you don't have contempt for anime styling, it looks pretty nice.- The sheer variety of potential skills, combat-related and otherwise--it's extremely rare for a game to have its own music system, for example. - The community is fairly friendly and welcoming.- With the rebirth system, leveling is treated completely differently from most MMORPGs. It's still necessary, but more focused.- Combat requires more input than clicking skills on a hotbar. You still do that, but timing matters and knowing the right time to play defensive is key.Cons:- There are very few enemy models, with constant recycled ones given a new coat of paint. This is to be expected in MMOs, but Mabinogi is hit extremely hard by it.- The dungeons are likewise very formulaic, all series of hallways and square/rectangular rooms filled with enemies or incredibly simple puzzles. - While the rebirth system takes some of the pain away from leveling, it still feels somewhat limiting. Initially, with the bonuses of a new character, you can rebirth and start from level one with skill levels intact every real-time day. Once these bonuses wear off, it's once a week. For some, this is fine. For me, it's tedious. -Travel on foot is extremely slow. The game gives you the option of buying pets or using less feature-complete beginner pets to make up for this... Which is great, except it then puts pets on a timer. Once the time runs out, the pets go inactive until the next real-life day. It's needlessly limiting. - While the rebirth system helps, leveling still slows substantially over time during the period between rebirths.Don't get me wrong. I still like Mabinogi, and I still recommend checking it out... But you will know very quickly whether you have the patience for its unusual format.			"

 My full review on Mabinogi.I've gotten tired of playing several different MMOs.  But none of them I've played as long as I have played Mabinogi.  It rivals my playtime of minecraft- and I've played alot of minecraft.  Steam can only report about 25% of the hours I've played of it as most of the time, I had launched it through Mabinogi's website Located here.[mabinogi.nexon.net] Mabinogi has gone through a management change within the last few years.  Before it was to the point where one could call it pay to play- as they had a subcription required at the time for priemium storage.  That feature is now open to all players for the next 83 years.  Many of the pet features that Mabinogi had used to be restricted to paying players.  Most pets were around 16 to 35$ USD.  The game itself is still pay to win, as the point of playing the game is to enhance the player's expirence of the game itself.  This game is not fully based on combat (though the Generation Quests say otherwise).If you decide you want this game, it would be highly advisable to get yourself a human character to start with.  With the human character, you can get yourself a free Elf and Giant card.  Without paying further, you wont be able to get other cards.Pets are still pay for- and they do provide a nice benifit aside from looking cute.  Some you can ride, some can also fly.  There are also pets that have a rather large inventory.  There are three current free pets.  Two you get from doing the basic quests (no added inventory) and one you get from the Saga questline.  The game is not a fair free to play.  You can get boosts of every description from the shop, and some of the shop outfits you cannot get via other means.  It is pay to win.Though the free parts are rather nice.Amount spent on this game: 45$			"

												This game can be pretty awful, but it can also be amazing. It's really one you just have to try out. High points are that it's very original and adorably quirky. The combat system pulls you in and can be deeply rewarding, but that same combat system will be one of your greatest drawbacks if you don't live near the server. If this is the case, a lot of time will be spent taking hits when your character is waiting for the server to respond to your commands, and in spite of this being an MMO, almost the entire storyline of the game forces you to play alone, which turns way too much play time into a lonely grind through waves of monsters who aren't hindered by server speed. The overt glitchiness is an early sign of how little support the game receives from its managing company, which is easily the root of its issues, but the community is awesome and the game really does play like nothing else out there. Definitely worth a shot. Don't pass it by if you haven't at least put a few hours in, because if it grabs you it grabs hard and you have a great time, but beware that you will deal with a lot of frustrating errors due to lack of support.

												A different experience than most MMORPGs. Best part of this game is the rebirth system which allows for continuous character growth. A knockback and stun system, a variety of (outdated) crafting and life skills. Storyline leaves something to be desired and graphics aren't top-notch. Being run by Nexon has its downsides. But give it a shot, maybe you'll like it.			"

It is fun and so manny things to do with updates every once in a while. keeping you entertained with so manny things you will want to get done the time playing. Sadly It does get old and The combat system is very laggey so it will get boring at times which was the reason I stoped for a year. However if you like living in a mid evil real life kinda world. This is the game for you. I give this game a 6/10 a fun game to waste your time with but after a while you will start to put less time into it.

												Mabi's one of the few mmo's I keep going back to. Combat is not terribly complicated, but it beats standing in place and spamming abilities on a hotbar. There's also tons of stuff to do outside of combat now, and learning skills is easier than when it was first released in the states. The greatest flaw in this game is the cash shop, as it gives paying players a clear advantage in-game (for example, one can purchase pets/mounts that grant additional inventory space as well as items that reset points spent on skills).

												Honestly this game, has changed a lot over the years... Some changes good and some pretty bad... ;;  If you've never tried Mabinogi befor, it's an interesting game to pick up and play with your friends. This game has a lot of story elements, that is tied with plenty of social interaction with other players. Once a huge hit when it was first released to English speaking shores, but now slowly dieing off into history. The graphics are now dated, the engine... Surely, and the players of old have come and gone. The thought of a sequel or a spiritual successor is unknown to me. But if this game was rebooted, then it may have a brighter future. Sure there is Vindictus, aka ""Mabinogi Hero's"". But it's not a Mabinogi where the cute graphical art style stood supreme and friends were your best and loyal comrades that help you out when you need them most. Not many games of today are focusing on R and R to just sit around a campfire and chat these days and tell stories... Play this game if you're interested, but sure it's not going to compare well with titles of tommorow, but it has some charm. Old and New gamers alike still could say, this was a good game for its time. But now, unless you have a friend on hand... Well. It's not a very good game by itself anymore... It's really getting to the point of extinction.			"

												Still one of my favorite MMOs since childhood. Plenty of content has still been added over the years, probably making getting into it easier for newer scrubs than for older vanilla players like myself. But in this game, you can basically do whatever you want. Don't even have to fight if you don't want to. Just wanna cook? Go take cooking leasons and make dat paypuh. Just wanna make and maintain weapons? Go mine some ore and learn blacksmithing and make your own stuff or stuff for your friends. Just wanna play music? Get an instrument and compose songs or whatever. Just a nice, calming and relaxing game with fun combat. Combat is balanced enough where a Lvl 15 could possible take down a 40 if they play use their skills right. And although Nexon has gotten awfully Jewish over the years, games still ain't Pay2Win. Even with your basic equipment from the beginning shop you could still beat those spoiled emo kids who spent $40 on horses or premiom gear. Overall still a great non-generic MMO with nice combat, land, and overall fun. 10/10 IGN/Sessler approved.			"

												Its the MMORPG that has had me the most entertained and has very unique features, the game sure has quite changed over the 4 years I played it, but its still great, sadly i wish some of its issues and glitches were to be adressed, lag also plays a large problem, but overall, I love the game. Its very social, and its combat system is rather stragetical, but it can even be played to the point its like an action game!, despite of how outdated and glitchy, and all of its other problems it contains, I have yet to see another game to have some of the unique features this one has, its already a decade old as well and its pretty innovative till today.So far, no other mmorpg managed to steal me from this one, as for now, its the best mmorpg out there for me.For 4 yearsEDIT---Its been quite a while since I wrote this review, but im here to update, this game is going to an awful direction, the optimization is getting worse, old content is getting ignored, the game is heavily unbalanced to the point that theres no difficulty, enemies are either too easy, or too cheap, I loved this game a lot and enjoyed it a lot, but then the game just took a bad turn and it seems like it wont turn back from that.The game seems to be far beyond recovery to what is actually fun about it, theres many outdated things about it that devs wont bother to touch to keep the game consistent and up-to-date, and no, im not talking about graphics or any of the new-tech sort of the thing, im talking about how several parts of the game havent been touched for years while more and more content is being added but doesnt mix well with the rest of the game. Its only getting worse in terms of whats balanced, even the story was screwed with so much that none of it makes sense anymore, I wouldnt bother recommending this game to anyone anymore, all what I see left of it is a bunch of people wanting to look pretty in it.

												If you love doing insane amounts of quests and stories, you should enjoy it. Other wise IDC about the quests any more.

												This game is perhaps one of the strangest, most beautiful games that I have ever had the pleasure to play.I've had maybe 500 hours offline, and I'm still not even close to getting to the end of the game. Why not? Because you can have millions hours of this game, and you'll never finish. This isn't a game that's focused on fighting- it's shaped around social interactions. I've spent hours just sitting in a square, talking to friends and listening to people play music. This is a game that you'll go to find friends in, to relax and talk in, not fight endlessly in.			"

You must be 12 years old or something, to play this brain-dead-reject! OMG. I had to force myself to at least try it- give it a chance- to let it grow on me. FAWK NO. UNINSTALL THAT 6 GB REJECT~! Jesus Christ, if this game was a religion... I'd blow my brains out. I'm serious. don't play the game, get trading cards, craft badge, maybe get a rare background and forget about this game.

												I've played this game well over 1,500+ Hours through the Nexon Launcher. This game at first is very slow because of the land needed to travel but because of these updates it is much easier than before on new players. The game itself is actually pretty unique from the other mmo's I have played. People tell me this is like runescape but I still don't feel it. The combat is very fluid is you have a decent connection. In this game you are bound to socialize more than the actual storyline or grind, but only because of the nice community this game offers.

The whole reason I use Steam is to make it easy to access games, but this one has defeated my best efforts.  Maginobi support just says to use their launcher instead but I'm too frustrated to do that.  And I want to use Steam.Would certainly not recommend to others and hope that the developers can develop better coordination with Steam.			"

												I couldn't even play this game. It lagged so hard on both my computers, and when I did get on it, issues and alerts kept poping up. I spent 40 minutes just trying to make a character just to find that the game won't work. Basically, if you don't have a good graphics card, don't download the game. And if you do, I can't guarentee that you will or will not lag.			"

												This game is decent and I can play for hours I guess you could say but there're so many crappy people on this game :/. I would recommend this game but honestly it's such a time killer and it pushes you into spending tons of money on it. Like I said, most of the people I've met on this game are either rude, perverted, stupid, untrustworthy, etc. Some of my old friends  fit in really well with the community, how I don't know. But in my opinion, it's just full of a bunch of people I don't want to be around. But, if you do have time and money to waste and you think you would fit in with this godawful community, then go ahead. And I suggest people 14+ because I know being a young person playing this game is extremely stressful. For example, lets say if you tell a close friend that you're 12 they might think of you differently, exclude you, think of you as weird, and/or tell you that you're too young for the game. I'm saying this because that's happened almost every time I told someone in this game that I am younger than most people that play. But, if you're lucky enough and you know how to make people like you regardless of your age then you might have some luck with this game.			"

												This game has changed a lot over the years. It used to be a quaint little game based on Celtic mythology. Now it is an anime based game with everything from dragons to scooters to food trucks. Mabinogi is a great sandbox game if you want to just explore the world, have the freedom to level up any skills you want (unrestricted by a class system) or meet people and be social. The world is bright and cheerful, with a darker main storyline to quest through if you want some direction in the mostly sandbox game. Unfortunately, the game is VERY heavily pay to win. If you want to have good gear, good stats, and be able to participate in high end content, you will have to buy items in the cash shop to increase your character's power. The worst part about this is that the items (gachapon, reforges, etc) are completely RNG based. So you might have to buy just a few to get what you want, or you might spend hundreds of dollars and still not get what you want. Also sold in the cash shop are numerous pets, which help quite a lot in combat. Each of these pets runs about $15, so it can get expesive quite fast. Finally, there are many, many types of boosters that are sold in the cash shop, to help you raise your skills faster and level up faster. These are less of a problem, because it's just a time vs money thing, but it is still the icing on the cake to make this game pay to win.Because of the numerous pay to win elements, I cannot recommend this game, as charming and friendly as it is. If Nexon would just restrict the cash shop items to cosmetics and maybe a few boosters, I would recommend this game in a heartbeat.			"

												I lived on this game for litterally more then a year... i wasnt employed or in school, so it was play, sleep, play sleep, day in and day out. Unfortunatly, it reached a point after about level 1,000 (which is considered noob if you never played the game since some people are levels 8-12000 xD) and the content just started lacking... i also started realizing that the game economy is unbeleivable, the trolls are countless, and Nexon puts out these ""Awesome 'NEW' Events"" which are just recycled events or really bad attempts... there was an SAO event (sword art online) and everyone was excited since Mabinogi is rated the #1 closest game to the anime... Nexon absolutely ♥♥♥♥ED IT UP! The event was spamming dungeons and fight the easiest ""final boss"" ever, as well as watch kirito fight a dragon while picking up rocks... it was a joke, NEXON, YOU SUCK, SELL MABINOGI TO A GOOD COMPANY LIKE SOE FOR EXAMPLE!

												I used to like this game, and I occasionally spent a little money on it. It's one of those games where you have to put in a lot of time to get in any results, but I didn't mind. I had a lot of time to kill. As time passed, it became increasingly clear that this was a pay-to-win, even moreso than in the past. The price of pets was rising to over twenty dollars. That was alright, I could still play. It wasn't as much fun, but I still had the friends I made in the universe of Mabi.After a while, I started to have trouble launching the game - sometimes it would crash after a few minutes. Not long after, it started to do that every time I tried to play. I tried reinstalling it; at this point it quit launching altogether. I submitted a ticket to nexon, which was automatically canceled since it fell under Tech support; the automated message told me to post in the Tech support forums. I was a little irritated, but I did anyways. I had sunk a lot of time into this, so I didn't want to give up so easily. I didn't get any help, just a few useless comments and one or two people saying they had the same problem.I found the game was on steam, and all was well for a time. However, when I helped my Guild mine stones for a castle we'd won in an Auction (it would only be ours temporarily) and we completed it, I found that I needed Premium service to actually enter the dang place. I was less than pleased. I still played a little, just dinking around and talking to my friends now and then, working an undeveloped character I happened to have when I had some time to kill. (I avoided playing it unless I KNEW I had a lot of time; many of the quests require a maddening amount of running back and forth to two NPC's who were often on different ends of the continent, or at least a few cities apart. This game is impossible unless you drop some cash on pets to get around without going insane. Even then, travel takes longer than is fair, and with the increasing size of cities, much of which are empty and with a handful of NPC's spread over something that can take half an hour or more to traverse on foot...) Then, after a while, it started crashing after a few minutes again. At this point, I begrudingly cut my losses, deciding that it wasn't worth the effort and the frustration I was getting from the worsening pay-to-win environment and rising costs.			"

												With my previous experience with this game (and my current play after recent updates), it is hard to say whether or not I actually enjoyed it. What I liked was the customisability and open world feel to the game, with many different play options to explore. However, after my terrible experience with paywalls a few years ago, I subsequently quit playing. Downloading it again to see what improvements had been made.PROS- The game is up to you how to play and explore.- There are many different ways to customise your character.- A devoted fanbase.- Opportunity to waste many hours.CONS- Compatibility and anti-aliasing issues.- It's an old game, so some textures look very low-res, whilst newer items/areas look far more detailed, which breaks the flow of the game, in my opinion.- While the fanbase is devoted, the player base is much smaller than it was, leading to the world feeling barren and empty.- The combat system takes a lot of getting used to, and often made me want to flip the table.- Some story aspects seem forced to add content (race war, really?)- Pop up windows, annoying and always at the worst times.Overall, if you're new, you're a bit late to the party. Has Nexon quality (generally p2p and such). But if you can cope with the cons and somewhat annoying pop up windows, and playing mostly alone, then go for it![this review is my experience and opinion, debate it any way you see fit :)]			"

												i enjoyed playing this game many many years ago and return for a breif visit every now and then. *sadly Nexon lost my account and lacks a human heart capable of customer service* the game hasnt changed much at all outside of random changes and restructuring of Nexon's rascally business practices. which may or may not bennifit the player or can outright rob them blind.there are reports of players requesting aid in recovering stuff that falls through the cracks and waiting for somtimes years before a responce which never is an offer for help but may instead include a threat for banning or prossecution in court... most of the time it's an automatted message saying they dropped your ticket with no option to appeal... so dont bother customer service they are a bunch of meanyheads. Nexon doesnt do customer service... the page is there only for show.I would have to not reccomend playing this game only because its run and managed by Nexon a very terrible game develloper/producer that has a tendancy to destroy wonderful creations and has an almost blantant disregard if not hatred of American & European customers. the game itself and its vibrant and adorible community are wonderful however.if you plan on spending money on the game, make your purchases through Steam... as there isnt a limit to what or how much you want to spend... and Valve will butcher Nexon if they rob you. which Nexon has done in the past with thier game cards and homepage credit purchases.mabinogi is adorible & fun... but my personnal experience with Nexon has ruined any chance ill ever play any of thier titles for risk of loosing an eye or limb.

												Unlike other Asian MMOs where it is filled with fanbase of big boobs, panty shots, etc. for the male/lesbian taste, and mainly focused on combat. This is a fun MMORPG to try out for at least 3 days (or your money back).When you first start, you may feel overwhelmed and excited to try out as many skills as you can. It is highly recommended that you try out each skill at least a few times before leveling it from Novic to F (if it requires 0 AP then go ahead) because you will not get those back. Eventually you'll figure out which talent you want to invest in, take your time on that.One thing I really like is that the clothing/equipment doesn’t always look the same in color and may not have the same stats either, if created by tailoring and/or blacksmithing, same for some weapons. This game really focuses on teamwork and is very welcoming to casual players as well. Another thing I really enjoy the most is how some of the NPC's break the 4th wall at times, or that some of the enemy's you meet will wear funny disguises. Lastely, weapons and equipment are sort of irrelevant in damage and defense. Talents are what really helps you grow whether be combat or non-combat talents. Level, Age, and Race also play as a factor for stat increase. Can also earn money not only by questing or grinding, but by part-time jobs or commerce as well! If you play your cards right, you could earn 10k+ in no time!There are a few flaws/annoyances though: Can only make one character (Only bright side is that with your first character you can pick all the choices, normal and premium, for customizing, however will have to purchase another character card via cash shop, depending on type price varies, or make an alliance with either Elves or Giants to get a free card of that race). There is no advance warning that you’re using a beginner inventory package till level 30, where you’re able to use the full bank inventory, but the right half will be locked after level 30 and anything stored in there will be stuck unless you get the Inventory Plus Service from the Cash Shop for $8 for 30 days. The inventory on your character may get easily filled if you’re taking on too many talents. When buying a pattern or a blueprint for crafting clothe, weapon, armor, you don’t know what materials will be needed till after you purchase and start to use it. Best to use the wiki for this, it’ll save you up on gold.Recommend doing 2-3 life skill talents that require frequent inventory space like Tailoring, Medicine, and Cooking. It is nice to have at least one combat talent too like Close Combat (aka Warrior), Lance, Magic, etc. Say no more than two combat talents though if you wish to do any non-combat talents, and vise versa.On the server I go to, Alexina, the community is friendly and helpful to newbies (however there are exceptions.) I have rarely seen any players that gloat/brag/show off about their W/L record, about how strong they are, or about their equipment and skills. This makes the game fun and comfortable to play in. Overall, who needs skill when you can have fun? That’s what the game is really emphasizing, fun!The only piece of fanbase you’ll get the best of is at the start after making your first character. Enjoy the bouncy boobs while you can, because that’ll probably be the only time you’ll get to see anything jiggle on a woman!-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

Only about 50 things out of the 500+ pets, hairs, outfits so forth are ""Not for sale""3.Yes, it is a free to play. honestly, I now know why.4."" thousands of devoted players await!

												Let me get this straight off the bat: I love Mabinogi. Character customization skill-wise is my top priority when it comes to MMORPGs, but when you start shifting the focus towards vanity items that do absolutely nothing except for making your character look good and you add a crap ton of random classes that confuse the heck out of enemy AI who've only had to deal with melee, bows, and magic, that's when I start frowning on the game. Ignore the playtime Steam has. I've played for quite awhile on the standalone launcher. Anyway, back to the review. In a nutshell, Nexon has turned Mabinogi into a cash grab with no good updates in who knows how long just to satisfy their greed. Yes, I just called Nexon out for being greedy. Yes, I will continue to point out Nexon's flaws through out this review.| Gameplay |The original system for Mabi's combat was a modified rock-paper-scissors match which required skill more than luck. Smash broke through Block, Counter evaded Smash's slow attack, normal melee couldn't break Block, etcetera, but with the addition of new classes and skills along with it, the AI of the mobs just can't cope. They only know the bare essentials with maybe a special skill or two for the bosses.Outside of combat the economy of Mabi is jacked.

												If you are planning on getting any game from Nexon, I highly reccomend getting the game directly from Nexon. Soon as I got Mabinogi, I couldn't log in for very long and it would kick me off stating that I needed to be logged in again. The Steam launcher for Mabinogi did not log in sucessfully with Nexon before running the game.			"

												Let me get this straight off the bat: I love Mabinogi. Character customization skill-wise is my top priority when it comes to MMORPGs, but when you start shifting the focus towards vanity items that do absolutely nothing except for making your character look good and you add a crap ton of random classes that confuse the heck out of enemy AI who've only had to deal with melee, bows, and magic, that's when I start frowning on the game. Ignore the playtime Steam has. I've played for quite awhile on the standalone launcher. Anyway, back to the review. In a nutshell, Nexon has turned Mabinogi into a cash grab with no good updates in who knows how long just to satisfy their greed. Yes, I just called Nexon out for being greedy. Yes, I will continue to point out Nexon's flaws through out this review.| Gameplay |The original system for Mabi's combat was a modified rock-paper-scissors match which required skill more than luck. Smash broke through Block, Counter evaded Smash's slow attack, normal melee couldn't break Block, etcetera, but with the addition of new classes and skills along with it, the AI of the mobs just can't cope. They only know the bare essentials with maybe a special skill or two for the bosses.Outside of combat the economy of Mabi is jacked. You can hardly get started nowadays without buying something with real money from the Nexon store. Maybe, just maybe, if you find a experianced player then maybe they'll give you some gear, but with Mabi's playerbase dropping, it would be very rare.| Graphics |Perhaps the greatest point of Mabi is the graphics.

												Ground rules:Don't ever jump into this game without knowing anything. Don't recommend anything aside from a warrior talent for begginers. (Because no one gets other talent tutorials.

What is more important is if you know how to use your skills, weapons, and the enemy's AI to your advantage. Overall you have to learn a few things by yourself in this game and not give up if you want to get anywhere.			"

												Don't touch this. You will be poisoned. You have to Set GOALS in this game or you will get extremely bored extremely fast. You know how most MMO'S focus on actually playing the game? In the first two towns of this game, people do nothing BUT SIT AROUND AND TALK ABOUT TYPICAL HIGHSCHOOL 'HE SAID SHE SAID' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. Everyone in the game strives to be the most flashy, putting on metric ♥♥♥♥tonnes of sparkly, CPU draining equipment which will cause your framerate to drop like a ♥♥♥♥ing rock, not to mention that they like to brag about their laggy equipment and pretend their better than you. And dont even get me started on the economy. Even the most basic set of armour will cost you an arm and a leg, forcing you to grind HOURS upon HOURS of grinding. And guess what? Most of the time when you have to repair it, it'll ALSO cost and arm and a leg, and theres a chance it wont even repair correctly and you'll lose durability.The verdict? Pour gasoline on it and toss a match. I would'nt♥♥♥♥♥♥to put this out.			"

												Personally, I do not like Mabinogi.  It has a lot of promise buried some where deep within it, but it never really appears.The story you experience in the game consistently has you helping NPCs you'd rather brutally murder.  And the quests tied to these stories have various levels of imbalance, either being way too easy for a long time, or way too cheap all of a sudden causing you to die like crazy.Although the game gives an impression that you can choose what skills you want to learn, what race you want to be, what equipment you want to wear, and what you want to do, you quickly learn that, in order to be good at the game, these choices quickly stop being choices.  Due to Combat Power requirements that only get worse as you level up and learn skills, you practically have to learn the skills in a set manner, with the most gruelling and reviled of these coming first simply because your lower Combat Power makes them ""easier"".  The races are imbalanced, with Elves being the butt monkeys of the game, Humans not really excelling at any one thing, and Giants being ""teh best evarz"".  Equipment is heavily restricted by Race and Gender, with the best either being horrendously ugly or costing an in-game fortune because they were once cash-shop items that you can no longer get.  And, as for doing what you want, you have the choice of pretending this is a fancy chatroom like Second Life or you have to do almost everything permanent, including the story, to become skilled at the game.Of course, this game also has problems with lag and latency.  Regardless of how fast your connection is or how good your computer is, you will find yourself getting cheaped on by enemies you should be owning because they have consistent 0 lag and erratic movement while the game's engine is struggling to display certain graphics or send commands at a reasonable rate.  This hinderance continues as you will also occasionally to frequently miss the timing on certain skills, such as the Chain 2 and 3 Fighter skills, because the server starts the timer on them before it even sends the data to your client and you have to go through as series of back-and-forth messages with the client and server to line whatever skill you are trying to do to whatever enemy you are trying to do it on.You might have better luck with the game than I did overall, but I'm just posting how I feel about the game.

Im kinda disappointed with the launching of the game not working for me because I was so hyped when I saw it.

If you manage to actually get in the game, it's pretty great. Easily the most unique MMO in the world.FYI Nexon's steam client installation is a cruel joke. When you attempt to launch the game, it will have to re-download THE ENTIRE CLIENT, around 3.8GB. I don't understand why Valve is allowing this. It goes against its historical QC trend.			"

												This is a fun game. The combat is satisfying, the side quests are amusing, the story is pretty interesting, all in all, it's a pretty good game. EXCEPT for the fact that it is poorly optimized. Not just I, but many others have reported crashing and freezing. I crash at Fiodh's Dungeon boss and I need to beat that boss to progress the story. But I can't! I've even paid money on this game and the fact I can no longer progress is quite frankly, fustrating. Perhaps you'll be luckier than me, but I would not take my chances with this game. It's a good one. But the fact that not everyone can continue progressing is a turn off to me.			"

												This game is like if Dark Souls was a cheaply made Korean MMO. The core features are especially brilliant and unique, BUT IT'S STILL A CHEAPLY MADE KOREAN MMO!

Dont bother sending a ticket to the gms, if they ever do respond it will be ' go look at the forms' for help. most of the time they wont. they finally fixed the bots after 2years but theres still hackers and if  you loose stuff in a glitch or hack you wont be getting anything back.

												Played it from the standalone version when it came out a couple years ago, had a lot of fun. The players were progressing a bit faster than the updates were coming, but everyone was fine with it, we were patient because the game was so solid and entertaining that being patient was the only logical thing to do.I had an archer with a sword. I would shoot my most damaging skill while the mobs were far, knock them down when they got too close, then finished with 1 or 2 well timed sword skills.The storylines were nice, the dungeons were even nicer, especially with friends.The loot/equipment was such a joy to acquire, the hoods, the armor!The classes worked so very good, it really was different from the rest.STOPPED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARSCame back around last summer to immerse myself in it again, hoping to catch a glimpse of what it used to be, maybe play a whole week non-stop during my holiday.NOPEClasses are ruined, system is chaotic, you don't work for what you want anymore, there's just too much stuff in your face distracting you from playing the game, the fighting is nowhere as good as it used to be.There's just no adventure anymore, this game used to be about adventure.

												Mabinogi is about as close to Second Life you can get without it actually being Second Life, and that's not a bad thing.The combat is like WoW- a toolbar for skills, click to attack, etc. The gameplay is solid, but quests get repetitive quickly. Clothing is very detailed, and character customization is simple. Overall, Mabinogi is worth the download and is a good time killer for when you don't want to play anything singleplayer or shooty.

												Having suddenly been re-engulfed in this game to a greater extent than ever, I'll try to give better context to its staying power. Mabinogi is very rough around the edges, thanks in part to the localization being managed by Nexon of all things. It's over a decade old and much a product of its time, unoptimized, laggy, hard to get running on a modern OS, not very user friendly, the game does not explain itself well, you will constantly have to reference the wiki to make any headway in a number of things and understand the convoluted backend systems at work, Nexon support is nonexistent, and above all else the barrier to entry is horrible.The way character progression works is by leveling up to gain ""AP"", which you use to rank up your skills that not only improve the skills' functionality, but often grant incremental stat bonuses. Then when the level grind gets too slow, you rebirth and start over from level 1 to continue accumulating AP. The end result is that the game is tailored around accumulating ridiculously inflated stat bonuses from skill ranks, to the point that your character level means little to nothing. Unfortunately, early quests are not very well balanced and have about as much chance of being a cakewalk as stoving your face in in an instant, as you are extremely fragile to start.Where the game shines is in breadth of content. Combat is action-based and operates on a sort of rock-paper-scissors triangle that has since bloated outward but is still pretty interesting, on the rare occasion when it isn't being crippled by lag. Combat skill trees include swordplay, blunt weapons and axes, battle alchemy, magic, puppetry (yes, really), dual guns, one-on-one fisticuffs, archery, lancing, musical buffs and bludgeoning instruments, and for the hell of it, ninjas. Production skills include blacksmithing, fishing, cooking, mining, tailoring, herbalism, metallurgy, magic craft, engineering, carpentry, various alchemy, commerce, and for the hell of it, playing instruments via MML - the latter of which is what hooked my interest to begin with, actually.If you're wondering where the payment incentive comes in, the answers are: pets, extra storage, and crappy lottery gachapons. Your starting inventory is pretty pithy all things considered; pets (that come with storage), special events, and limited edition cash shop items are the best remedy to this. Pets have the added bonus of being cute, and a semicompetent combat companion (if you level them up before they age).So it's a bit hit and miss, but as a whole the game itself is a remarkable sight better than it once was, between all the retoolings and added content. It's still kind of a guilty pleasure, but a good romp with friends. If you ever play, be sure to set up on the Mari server. It's where all the cool guys are at.			"

												While this game offers something new and different than your usual MMO, it is unfortunately crippled by many issues. Nexon is an inept company that always fails to get it right the first time. Nexon's first and foremost concern is taking your money. Anything useful, conveient, and in some cases, necessary you will have to pay for. Nexon's customer service is abysmal; commonly taking them over a year to respond to ticket and even longer to actually resolve it, if that ever manages to happen.Servers regularly crash and/or are under maintenance usually for a long time, especially during or after an update in which they inevitably break something. If they aren't, they're usually lagging, sometimes pretty bad. Hell, initally you need to mod the game just to make it acceptable to play.If you do decide to play this game be prepared for attention ♥♥♥♥♥s, severe weeaboos, 12 year old girls, 13 year old boys, adults that act like 12 year old girls and/or 13 year old boys, meme spewing, and rampant hacking. I say more power to them (hackers). There needs to be people that can remind everyone about how bad Nexon sucks with this game.A good game for people with a whole lot of disposible income ( or stealing mommy and daddy's credit card until they notice $100 vanishing every month) and people who can't play anything better.Some pros for those that think (and will probably continue to do so anyway) that I'm being biased: - Very moddable, pretty much everything, from the sun to the UI to the music can be modded into whatever you can find/make.- A good break-away from your typical mmo; offering things other games could learn from.- Interesting battle system. Although with a past update, took a bad turn imo.- Expansive customization from characters to clothes (be prepared to pay for this too though)Check out the forums.			"

												Everything requires some kind of money.. If you have a thousand dollars to spare, then go for it, even though it would be the biggest waste of money in existence. Now, back when Mabinogi was new, it was better, but still, you had to have money to do a lot of things, but I didn't mind that because you can go through the game like normal even without using you money, but now Nexon milks money out of this game like it's the biggest cash cow ever.

												Played this game on nexon launcher, paid some cash into it, thought it was really fun. UNTIL I played it for 30 hours. Then I realized, I had no friends, but that's besides the point. Main reason is because overworld seemed kinda empty. Then again, that's probably my computer was crap. Considering that CSGO crashed it, I think the world was empty because I couldn't render anything. [review will be revised when I give the game another chance circa: God knows when]			"

												(This is not a recommendation. It is an ANTI-Recommendation)The game is Okay and all, but Nexon is crap. they are a horrible publisher, and choose to charge insane amounts for things that shouldn't be that high price. What's more is, if you try to get the BBB involved with trying to get your support ticket noticed (Mabinogi tickets have a 6+ Month waiting time at least) the BBB will tell you that Nexon America has opted out of BBB, and therefore support cannot be given via BBB. (Shows how much they care for customers, etc.)The content updates are quite lacking nowadays, running out of ideas, still trying to milk money out of Mabinogi players, until Mabinogi 2 comes along (No, it's not Vindictus, there WILL be a Mabinogi 2.) Then they will just delete everyone, no refunds, no nothing, clean slate on Mabinogi 2.Of course, this doesn't come without issues. Nexon KR, the parent company of Nexon USA, has always disliked their USA Nexon branch, and maybe won't even push Mabinogi 2 through to it. So in all, if you play anything from Nexon, you're better off just quitting, or following the crowd like sheep or lemmings. I'm not trying to be rude here, but because of Nexon's inability to ""Play Nice"" with its community, I'm pretty much forced to.			"

												Mabinogi seems to have a lot to it but I can't get past the horrible game engine, poor graphics, poor camera and all the glitches. I can play most of the high end games with graphics on high with my computer. This and the fact that after playing for a few hours then logging off, I have to rewatch all the starting game intros and play the stupid villager killing monster before I can do anthing again? Pressing ESC wouldn't let me skip them. I looked for a save when I was done playing the first time but there was nothing in menu. I assumed it would save when I logged off. So instead of starting where I left off I was forced to watch intro again. All this means I will be deleting this game and playing something better. If this game is taking real money from folks they should really invest in updating the game engine and bring this title into the modern times. Good Luck. I really wanted to like this game but I have to say it's a pass for me.			"

												I tried to like this game, I really did. I was first introduced to the concept of this game, by a fellow student in a Irish folklore and folk life class and it seemed to me to be everything I was looking for in an MMO when it came to lore and interesting mechanics, however that sadly did not turn out to be the case. This game is defiantly for those who like to explore and have little to no guidance in what choices they make, which for me sadly meant wondering around a lot, losing time trying to figure what I was doing with my character, class and abilities and what have you. Between an almost dead community presences online (at least when it comes to help guide) and just overall becoming boring after the first few hours, Mabinogi just was not the right game for me  "

												It was hard to get into the character, not knowing anything about the game and just being tossed into the world with barely any knowledge of ... well anything.Character cards are ridiculous and make no sense.  Allowing a person to make one character per account or card is just silly and was a big turn off at the beginning.  Then suddenly I'ma  horse running around attacking spiders and wolves but unable to talk to anyone and no idea what was going on.  It's basically a game for older players.  As in, people who have been playing it for a couple of years and have gotten to know one another rather well through the game itself.  Which is fine, if you're looking for a social game.  I was looking for something with more adventure.  This was not that game for me.  Although it does have combat, it's tedious and slow.  With numerous combat progamming issues such as slow to no response, it get boring and annoying very quickly.  If you want to be with your friends from the beginning you have to make the same type of character.  Unless you are one of the players who has played for some time then you're aware of how to get where and what exactly you're doing.  I was enticed by the farming, cooking, trade skill aspects only to learn that those are the main skills you pick from the beginning.  While you're welcome to learn other skills or professions, if you picked cooking then cooking would be the only thing you truly excelled at which gives the game another annoyance factor for me personally.I'm not going to say anything about the graphics because I believe that graphics do not make the game no matter how beautiful or up to date it is, if the game play is awful it is awful and god rays won't save it.  t's dated to be sure but it works for what (I assume) the game is going for.  After awhile I got tired of children players running around and elves with large breasts giggling constantly and decided to try something else.It's a charming thought but all in all this game left me more confused than with the feeling of enjoying a real role playing game.  If you have extensive amounts of time on your hands, do not like social interractions in the real world or are one of the few serious fans left of the game, enjoy.  Otherwise, I would try something else with better, more responsive controls and doesn't rely on extreme amounts of beauty shop items in order to enjoy the ""game"".			"

												For the 32 or so hours it took to download and install this game, it was not worth it. I feel like there should have been more of a tutorial for the game as I had no idea what I was doing. I felt lost, and the character customization was lack-lustre. I expected more options than what was offered to me. A lot of the hair and eye colours and styles were locked until you purchased something. I was also disappointed in the fact that you could not choose your own clothing at the start of the game. This is definitely a game in which you'd want to level up in, and I'm assuming that leveling up in this game takes a long time. However, I will say one thing: the online community present in this game is very helpful and friendly. They were willing to give me and my friend really nice new clothing when we accidentally sold ours and were quick to offer tips and advice on playing this game. My only advice to you is that if you're interested in playing this game, doing extensive online research on how to play the game before playing would be highly reccomended in order for you to have a good start. However keep in mind that my friend and I did a little research; including watching a few ""Let's play"" videos on youtube, gong to the official website and wiki, and also going to a few fansites, which made us excited for the game and caused us to have high expectations of the game after seeing all the things you could do (after leveling up and/or spending real money). Added to the issues of not knowing how to play the game, and the ridiculously long download time (which after doing some research we discovered that it varied from person to person - one of the people we met on the game waited 3 days whereas some took no time at all), I found that this game was also incredibly boring, especially if you haven't leveled up. It definitely has a slow start and I'd definitely reccomend using a mouse as character movement proved difficult with a trackpad. Combat was confusing and even after I attempted to get through a short training exercise (which I did not complete since there were no tutorial instructions) I was still unable to figure out how to successful maneuver my fighting ability. However, between waiting for the game to install on Steam (which took about 7 hours) and waiting for the patch to download there was still an issue with creating an account. The account creation system we found was buggy and tempermental, and finally after that was dealt with and we were excited to start playing, there was still a patch to install. We found that while this wait was a one time thing, and is a lot faster when downloading from steam as opposed to the game's website, it still took about 22 hours to install, even on a relatively fast computer. While there are still a lot of good things to say on the game, there are more bad ones and in my opinion it all boils down to what your expectations of a MMORPG are. In my case, I was just looking for a fun game with easy-to-use controls and lots of options on what sort of things you can do. The game probably would have been better if new players received an extensive array of items when they first started playing. Things like a starter weapon, a fishing rod and a few more books focussing on starting level abilities associated with your class type would be useful. Overall, this game took way to long to download for how long I played for and for how much I enjoyed the game.			"

												Don't run this on Steam, ever. Just get it off Nexon's site, if you play for hours at a time, it will freeze. And when it freezes, even after the program is closed, steam will register it as running. Restarting steam or your computer will solve nothing.			"

												I loved this game so much and I played hours on it, then it started messing up and giving me errors every time I tried playing it. I tried uninstalling and re-installing and the game continues to give errors. I have tried several methods of trying to fix these errors, but in the end I just had to call it quits. It's a good game if you can get past the errors, but in all I do not recommend it due to the unstability of the game itself.			"

												Cool little MMO at first, certainly a lot of options, but I stopped playing when I found out that flying on my griffon mount ws disabled in most areas. Is that a petty reason to stop playing a game? Probably. But roleplaying as a powerful wizard who rides a griffon and smites his enemies from the sky is epic- the same wizard finding out he can no longer fly and has to walk everywhere is a lot less epic. Not to mention the samey, boring dungeons.			"

												Tried to play this game, the controlls were difficult for me to learn, the quests had me all turned around and as a beginner to this game everything was self-learning. Barely anything for a tutorial to teach you, I personally had tons of bugs, such as I would use the health potions but it would not heal me and died several times for it. Not much to say for the graphics, if you like the cutesy not so detailed and smooth games than go ahead.Only thing I did find pleasant about this game was its inhabitants, the community was very helpful and I had already made friends 10minutes into the game. Sadly I wasnt able to get over the other issues.			"

												I tried my hardest to enjoy the game, but the combat was just terrible and there were way, way too many bugs for a game as old as this (If you're wondering it was released in 2004 in korea and 2008 in NA). There were just so many times where I would enter a building and get stuck and have to relog or be fighting an enemy and your character will literally just sit there. With that being said, this MMO is more of a social game rather than a combat game, which isnt really my cup of tea. The graphics are nice but they definitely haven't aged well at all. I think the biggest flaw though is the somewhat Pay-to-win aspect of the game. You almost HAVE to spend a decent amount of money to even make the game convient enough to play. They give you a mount to use, but even then it only lasts for 1 hour and a half each day unless you buy the ""permenant"" version, and in a game where the quest NPCs are sometimes continents away, you'll find yourself spending more time walking from place to place than actually enjoying yourself.

												 This game is more than just a bad game or a game with too many nerfs, buffs, ecenomic instability, pay to win or anything like that.... all of those are here in one way or another but hear me out, please:Mabinogi is the definition of the game that punishes you for playing it.First off, if you do have a morbid curiosity and decide to start the game, mute it. Immediately. Go into your control panel, turn down the Client.exe or Mabinogi volume through system settings, then play. If you do not do this you will be blasted with late-90's synth music that will at least make you ill, and the remaining sound effects will make you deaf.If you are still playing you will notice that you have nothing to do, and no idea what to do at all. While odds are you won't need the wiki at this point, you will need to do anywhere from 20 to 30 missions depending on the class you picked just to unlock your skills.If you manage to actually do all of these 15 minute long missions for each skill, you should just stop. Close the client, because  what you did was all you should do.You see, the game developers (at least for the north American side of the game) don't actually like it when people play the game, because their ""special events"" give you more experience for doing half-programed mini-games than actual dungeon crawling, which no one does because dungeon crawling is obsolete, and has been for years. How? simple: buying ""gachapins"" from the real-money shop can give items that are better than anything you will ever find in any dungeon. What about making the armor with blacksmiths? NOPE: event and gachapin items have better stats than anything a blacksmith can make. The newest lifeskills even? nope, new armor an weapons where released a few months later. Anything that doesn't involve throwing away real money and standing around doing nothing will just make you a second-rate character, and sometimes, you just have to sit around and do nothing, since most events reward you if you're AFK!The only thing that 90% of people do in this game is sit around town in their outfits, or try to make money by doing event mini games to make money. The few people who actually play the game typically hate what the game has become, and would play something else if they hadn't invested so much time and money in the game.Oh, did I mention that the story will make your eyes bleed? Don't read the fluff text, especially if it involves Shakespeare.TL;DR: doing nothing in this game is more rewarding than actually playing it. Do not waste your time and sanity.			"

												What can I say about this ""Thrill-Ride"" of a F2P game? Sorry for the ovbious sarcasm, but let's take a look at Mabinogi:This game first off immediately tries to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off by playing super-loud music at the start screen that you can't change until you've made a character. Now I know what you're thinking: There's a mute button stupid, but at the same time an experienced friend of mine is trying to teach me the basic stuff about the game. To add to that, the game is impossible to figure out unless you have a friend guiding you the whole way. Also, the game is ridiculously slow-paced and boring with just everything that you do. The combat system is ridiculously tedious and annoying to use. When you first create a character, you instantly discover you can only have one character per account and VERY limited customization options. If you try to create a male character, it will always look like a female. The pay to win system is unbelievably bad and stuff costs way too much. The resolution isn't even optimized for all screen resolutions so it looked really sluggish to me. Everything in the game looked horrible and low-res. There is tremendous lag on every server and channel even though I have way above the recommended system specs for this game. The worst part is, the customer support for the game by the publishers, Nexon, are unresponsive and couldn't care less for the community. The servers are practically barren and the few people I find outside of the 2 friends that tried to guide me through the game never leave me alone and spam the chat like crazy. The first guy you meet, Duncan literally tells you that: ""All of these jobs may seem boring to you."" So heed his warning. The only things that are nice about this game is that it is a bit different from other mmos and the story is set up well. But other than that, this feels like a boring, tedious, annoying, and a confusing experience the whole way through. This game is slowly dying so I advise not to get in to it. The sad thing is, I hear from lots of dedicated players that the game was decent when it first came out back in 2003, but then Nexon screwed it up significantly. The worst part is, there are way better Free-To-Play MMOs like Planetside 2, Warframe, SWTOR, Rusty Hearts, Cosmic Break, and so on. This game was so bad that my testicles committed suicide due to the lack of testosterone considering that no matter what you do to customize your character, you'll always look like a female! Not being sexist or anything, but I want to look like my own gender please, come on now Nexon!To sum it up, this isn't just a bad F2P MMO, it's probably one of the worst F2P MMOs I've ever played. Just do yourself a favor and just play a different F2P game unless you enjoy grinding for several hours just to earn or do anything that is cool or fun at all.P.S. This game killed my son and I became an alcoholic thanks to this game.			"

												A good MMO if you don't want do battle. The battle system sucks and is frustrating as hell, however the music system is original and good, it allows you to put any song you want into the game, if you know how.On the music system there is a lot to offer, ranging from different instruments to creating your own music score, solo or band optimized.The music system is the largest pull of the game, and is certainly what got me to get the game and stay in it for longer than I care to admit.Be wary of the ""free"" grab as well, everything is free except quite a lot of the game, which can be frustrating because to have more than one character, you have to buy, to have your character look unique, you have to buy.However it has addicting game play and interesting NON-combat orientated systems, but the moment you get into the combat, you're greeted by a poorly designed system, that not only makes it boring to fight, but painful, on that note the combat side feels ignored, the drop rate ratios are far from decent, and the dice roll based damages, can be quite unforgiving for new players, or Australian players, as there are no Australian servers which makes latency, a royal pain in the left butt cheek.This game gets a 4/10 from me.

Went to the nexon.net site and tried to create an account from there. Another error. Every time I try to register I get an error, no matter what method.Submitted a support ticket yesterday, no response. If they can't even manage a simple registration process, I can't imagine the game is all that great either.			"

												Okay, I'll give a serious review of this game now.I've wasted about $7000 dollars and 9 years of my life playing this game, and in the end if you asked me if it was worth it, I'd say hell no.This game has an inferior game engine that has been used like a beaten horse since 2006. There are no scheduled plans for this game's engine to get the update it so desperately needs, and because of this, the game suffers extreme lag day in and day out.The community of this game is toxic as all hell, not as toxic as say, League of Legends, but pretty ♥♥♥♥in' bad.The game's systems are outdated, and while I will say this: I have enjoyed several aspects of the game, from the fast-paced, skill-based combat, to the fact that you can use a programming language (MML: Musical Markup Language) to literally creat your own pieces of music; the game is severely lacking in other aspects, such as proper guild-managment systems and end-game content. Recently, you might say, they added a new dungeon that is consider end game, but that is only accessable through months of grinding to get to a minimum level of 3000, and that's not the hardest variation of said dungeon, which, to reach, you need to have a minimum level of 7000, and good luck finding someone to help you out with that.Speaking of which, something the community has asked for time and again is the server merge the game so desperately needs, as whenever I do log on, I see maybe 5-6 people on my friendslist of 300 people actually online.And you might be also asking, but Gil, what's that $7000 up there about? Well, I'm glad you asked, because instead of offering meaning and worthwhile content, the devs of this game would rather♥♥♥♥♥♥out the ugliest, worthless and most useless piles of♥♥♥♥♥♥items through their ""Gachapon"" systems that they try so hard to grab your hard-earned money with almost every 2 weeks when they put them up for sale. I have attained a literal gambling addiction, from spending so much money trying to get the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ing things in these last 9 years, and I've accrued so much debt that I now require to sell some stuff to make up for the debt of all the money I wasted throughout the years.I will say this to everyone, and everytime I'm asked if this is a good game to play, my answer will always be the same: NO. DO. NOT. PLAY. THIS. GAME. IT. IS. A. WASTE. OF. TIME. MONEY. AND. EFFORT.			"

Grade: 40/100Difficulty: Convoluted, at best.Pros: Promises of customization and a pretty world...Cons: ...which are lies, lies and more lies. You pay for anything and everything, right from the start, and the delivery of the promised things falls very short. Most people I know who have tried this game also reported buggy computer problems associated with the installed files that cleared up once they uninstalled the game.Replayable: No. Do not recommend. Find a real MMO, not this sorry excuse.			"

												I remember playing this a long time ago and liking it. But now I don't know what I was thinking back then. The movement controls are horrible. You will probably spend most of the beginning trying to get used to walking around. And when talking to an NPC, before speaking it's normally silence or quiet background music. But if you speak to an NPC there is a sudden and uneeded change to the music. It is overall frustrating to play			"

												Stay away from it while you can.~Axelrod of AlexinaIf you want an explanation, literally all of the hours that I've put into this game have gone into AFKing. If there was a point where I wasn't AFK, it was because I was talking to friends. Why nothing else?Your input is delayed if you don't adjust your network settings, the game's so unoptimized that the font they use is even capable of causing frame skips, and any new content they have have gets stuffed into a gachapon.What's a gachapon?A gachapon is a form of gambling that is legal for people of any age if you do it in Mabinogi, as long as you convert your real money into a fake currency they call NX and spend your NX on these boxes that are more likely to have garbage inside of them than what's advertised. And the people who localize this game even embrace gachapons enough to make them into a Steam emoticon.So I'll re-emphasize my point. Stay away from this game while you can. This review update was brought to you by a bored Axelrod on 3/28/2016.			"

												This trailer made the game very enticing with my friend but after your every day ordinary game installment, we still had to update a patch which in total took up to 22 hours before we were able to play! It caused unnecessary stress while we were killing time during this long ridiculous delay. When it was finally completed and we were looking forward to play, we only came across a disapointing discovery: this is more of a Play It To Win It type game and you only have limited options to choose from when creating your own character unless you rather waste a whole bunch of $$$ which could be spent on another game. It was a big let down and not worth our time! Besides that, I got to see a rooster kick a fox's @ss karate style haha!!! :3			"

												Everywhere I look there is promising reviews about this game. The idea of owning a house, crafting, offering something new, ect. However the game is overly complicated and the tutorials are extremely bad. The graphics are flat out terrible as are the controls and camera angles. The game also looks almost nothing like the videos or pictures you see and I'm assuming it’s because their supported resolutions are so low. The combat system also just doesn’t feel like it belongs in the game. Just a very outdated game, needs to be remade.			"

												Mabinogi. When i found this on a top ten list of anime mmo's, i got rather excited, and couldnt wait to play the game. From what ive seen, its really good! trailer is cool, showing what looks like a robust open world to live in , rather than play in. Un fortunatly, thats where to good stuff ends. After a one hour download for the files (3.8gb) in steam (not much, but wait. there's more), i went to play the game, thinking it should be fine, it's downloaded. 27 HOURS later, the 3.9gb patch FINALLY finished downloading (why take so long? *shrug*). Ok, so long downloads are nothing new. lets play. Iplay for 5min, looking awesome... then crash. 900mb update. ok, still going, still wanting to play the game. play again. Get to login screen and.... crash. enexplained, just an unhelpfull error message. fine. i give up. ill spend my time with simething else. good day.			"

												I agree with StalkingEmu this game is also bad beacause one of it's main ways to draw players in using a sexual fanbase. Just look at the woman on the cover, COME ON REALLY!*THIS IS HIS REVIEW*What can I say about this ""Thrill-Ride"" of a F2P game? Sorry for the ovbious sarcasm, but let's take a look at Mabinogi:This game first off immediately tries to ♥♥♥♥ you off by playing super-loud music at the start screen that you can't change until you've made a character. Now I know what you're thinking: There's a mute button stupid, but at the same time an experienced friend of mine is trying to teach me the basic stuff about the game. To add to that, the game is impossible to figure out unless you have a friend guiding you the whole way. Also, the game is ridiculously slow-paced and boring with just everything that you do. The combat system is ridiculously tedious and annoying to use. When you first create a character, you instantly discover you can only have one character per account and VERY limited customization options. If you try to create a male character, it will always look like a female. The pay to win system is unbelievably bad and stuff costs way too much. The resolution isn't even optimized for all screen resolutions so it looked really sluggish to me. Everything in the game looked horrible and low-res. There is tremendous lag on every server and channel even though I have way above the recommended system specs for this game. The worst part is, the customer support for the game by the publishers, Nexon, are unresponsive and couldn't care less for the community. The servers are practically barren and the few people I find outside of the 2 friends that tried to guide me through the game never leave me alone and spam the chat like crazy. The first guy you meet, Duncan literally tells you that: ""All of these jobs may seem boring to you."" So heed his warning. The only things that are nice about this game is that it is a bit different from other mmos and the story is set up well. But other than that, this feels like a boring, tedious, annoying, and a confusing experience the whole way through. This game is slowly dying so I advise not to get in to it. The sad thing is, I hear from lots of dedicated players that the game was decent when it first came out back in 2003, but then Nexon screwed it up significantly. The worst part is, there are way better Free-To-Play MMOs like Planetside 2, Warframe, SWTOR, Rusty Hearts, Cosmic Break, and so on. This game was so bad that my testicles committed suicide due to the lack of testosterone considering that no matter what you do to customize your character, you'll always look like a female! Not being sexist or anything, but I want to look like my own gender please, come on now Nexon!To sum it up, this isn't just a bad F2P MMO, it's probably one of the worst F2P MMOs I've ever played. Just do yourself a favor and just play a different F2P game unless you enjoy grinding for several hours just to earn or do anything that is cool or fun at all.P.S. This game killed my son!			"

												Yet another Seriously OLD game being ported onto STEAM in attempt to make profit.JUST. STOP.2004 release, 2008 NA   died in 2010 This game is Seriously OUT dated and UNDERwhelming.Now you may argue ""but free to play, how does it make money?""  - DLC, and  micro transactions.Despite what some THINK - the game is DEAD.Yes, SOME ""high levels"" come to lower level zones - but that is because there isn't anything to do for them.  They use the game as a chat service, like AOL used to be.  They are not active and there are not enough players active to consider it a ""MMORPG"" anymore. Let it die. Bury it again.  It's been dead for like 7 years... let it be.			"

You could easily touch the older things up one by one but they left them as they were and seriously they are unusable because they look so bad. The game itself is fantastic every story that unfolds reminds me of why I play but the older stuff doesn't seem to be cared for and it's losing track of it's roots.			"

My only issue with it is the fact steam didn't bother to update the installer for it. The update takes a very long time because it is a decently old version. To be honest it's faster to install it from nexon.net, issue is then you can't launch it using steam. Guess steam forces patience..			"

												I've spent almost two years on this game, and I've gotta say, I'm still sticking around.It's a unique game. Everything can be obtained, and there really is no true p2w. I guess it'd be p2getitemseasier.It's skill and leveling system is different compared to other games. There is no true level cap, and as long as you rebirth, you can keep on restarting from level 1 and getting AP all over again. There are no classes you choose. Simply equip the weapon you want to use, and have the skill. Weapons are unique as well. There are no ""Level 50 Behemoth Sword"". all weapons can be used from the get-go, excluding racial restrictions.Verdict: It's fun. Try it out if you think you might like it, and if you think you won't, still, try it out.			"

												Quite possibly one of the most annoying games I have ever played. Getting past the passwords for Nexon and Mabinogi popup and hotscreen to even play are ridiculous and getting your first skill is beyond annoying. I chose archer and the targeting system has you pressing multiple keys and resetting multiple times for each attack which is stupid. You dont get much of a character choice or pet choice unless you pay for facial expressions and get ""tickets"" for all the other extras. So for such a dinky little game with awkward controls and lousy targeting system it isnt worth a penny of my money. Glad this was a free to play or I would be upset.			"

												A fantastic game run by a 'meh' company. The game is great, there's plenty of content so you'll rarely be stuck with nothing to do. To add to that, this game focuses on the idea of a 'fantasy life', so you're not just forced into fighting monsters all day long. There's a lot of different things to do, and it's up to you to decide what your personal goals are. The biggest problem with the game is that it isn't very beginner friendly, even after a few attempts to make the game easier for beginners. You'll probably want help from someone who plays the game avidly to help you get a good idea of how things work out. The main thing to remember is that this is a game, so just enjoy yourself. Everyone who plays this game wants to have a nice fantasy life, so try not to ruin it for them and they shouldn't try to ruin it for you, either.			"

												To make this fairly simple for those who want to know if this game is worth playing, i say yes...however thats simply not enough to be said about this game, because for all the time ive played video games and what ive labled as a ""bad"" game this game has... 1.poor visuals: this games graphics are very simple and... like most games that try to do the anime style onto a 3D modle it translates oddly.2. it is buggy as ♥♥♥♥... you see monsters stuck on themselves ALL the time.3. you gotta pay into it to get the most outta it.so by those factors alone, one would think... why waste the time then? Well my inquisative gamers ill tell you why, its been the best experiance i have had with a ""fantasy-life"" MMO, its strange sounding, especially with the afformentioned problems.the possiblity of customization is insane and the open class system is well done, want to be a knight? well congrates get a lance and you learn the basic knight skills. want to be a mage? well thats covered, want to be a druid that transforms into animals like WoW? well guess what thats in there too.  (not to mention you have a crap ton of things to turn into, from a useless chicken, to a dragon, to one of you favorite NPC's) the games subtle details are very nice like food affecting your weight, ageing and getting taller, your charector looks at a player after they type things in. and the sence of acheivemnt is pretty good in this game, making a weapon for the first time felt REALLY awesome because it was a lagitamently difficult.To make a pretty broad statement about this game this game looks like crap, smells like crap , but tastes like paradise,and im almost certain if nexon did a mabinogi 2, with cell shading, voice actors, and stomped out the stupid bugs... you would be looking at the next greatest MMO			"

												I am going to try and write an endepth and fair review for this game including what i love and what i hate. ill break it down into 3 catagories 1.The Good 2. The bad and 3. The Ugly        So lets start with the good. mabinogi is a f2p game that does not treat you like a second class citizen when you play it. you can earn alot of things most games would make you pay for from either other players or just hard work. The community is also very nice unlike world of warcraft or other mmos ive played. most people i have met are kind and friendly and love to help new players out. A majority of the community seems like weeaboos but hey they are nice weeaboos. The combat system is very unique and is adaptable to almost any play style although some skills are just straight up better than others. almost every class is viable and if you are not happy with your class you can swap it in 3 weeks or 1 day if you are under level 100.          The bad. This mmo used to be predatory. very pay to win and there are alot of things from the past that come to haunt you. for example the generation quests. in order to beat the final boss of Generation 3 you will NEED someone who is about level 1000 or higher to help you beacuse it is a gaint dragon who does massive aoe 4000 damage attacks.  (at this point you will have about 150 heatlh). there are still a few pay to win elements for exampe you could buy a cloud that will heal you when you summon it. sounds alright right? well what if you buy 4 of them? you got a chain of full health aoe heals for the low low price of 60 dollars. Want the best upgrade for your weapon? be prepared to grind for hundreds of hours to repair it or just pay 5$.           Another thing is the economy. Do you wanna study how inflation works in an economy run by 15 year olds? well mabinogi is a great case study. anything remotley nice costs about 200000 to 500000 gold so once again do you wanna grind for hours and hours or do you wanna just buy expensive items from the store and sell them to players? although  I need to preface my gripes about pay to win by saying it is getting better. in fact it already is better in korea and we just gotta hope they keep updating the american version. you can not just grind levels infinetly beacuse the game has a system called rebirthing. rebirthing sets your level back to 1 but lets you keep all your skills. if you do not rebirth once you hit level 50 or so it becomes very very hard to level up and you have to wait 3 weeks to rebirth again. just another annoying progress blockerThe ugly. The art style is ALL OVER THE PLACE. very much influenced by korean culture even though the game is set in a mythical european setting. immersion breaking does not even begin to describe the cosmetics in this game. it is worse than tf2. You play as a bunch of immortal demigods so i guess it makes sense that they copy clothes from earth but still it makes no damn sense. I have alot more to say about the game but im sick of typing so ill wrap it up. The game is fun VERY FRUSTRATING. but fun and hey it is free just be sure to read up♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wiki and make friends and you will have a good time. Do not buy the starter packs on steam they are worthless garbage learn the game before you make any purchases (I apologize for the grammar and spelling mistakes i am to damn lazy to go through and spell check this.)

												Mabinogi is now a LEGIT FREE 2 Play MMO Game because before you had to wait 3 weeks to rebirth and gain more ap to rank your skills. Now its down to 1 week of waiting which means it gives u more time to rank your skills. So if ur like one of those people who like free roam, adventure, action MMOs try it out. It doesnt have a strict class system so you can be anything you want thats available (yes and i mean with constant updates there should be more skills coming out)			"

												Great community of players.  The element about the game that blew my mind in this game was the inclusion of music.  If you like immersion play this game!  There is a variety of interactivity you can choose from and also big adventures that await! The combat mechanic is also great.  There is strategy to the rock, paper, scissors playstyle that allows the player to never get tired of battle.  It's not a spam mechanic which is great! Look forward to playing with adventurers that give Mabinogi a try!			"

There are tons of skills you cna learn and master that are used differently than the usually mmo instead of slamming buttons you need to use each one depending on what your enemy is using to counter theirs or to go for the opening with a high inpact attack. every item is color changeable allowing you to dye your outfits and armor to be unique from every one else in the game and tons of customization options for your character to be a hero instead of Knight # 1087.

												    Community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ now most guilds require rediculously high total levels with two alternatives which happen to be new guilds (which usually die given a few weeks) or guilds with so much drama involved you'll be wanting to leave in a matter of hours. The skill systems suck now. When I first started playing mabinogi years ago the skill system was perfect the enemy AI was actually intelligent and made the game difficult which was FANTASTIC. With the addition and revamping of so many skills and now getting AP for talents it makes the game hilariously easy.   Sure hope you like spending money! Because if you like to save your money, back the ♥♥♥♥ away now! This game is pay to win and I should know as I've spent more than my fair share of money on this bucket of crap. Pets are basically useless now. Before it was difficult to beat the game without some kind of pet because the difficulty curve actually existed. Now Nexon is coming out with pets worth $12 that ♥♥♥♥ing SING ALONG WITH YOU.   Sure hope you don't like customer service when it comes to nexon. One of my accounts was banned years back for no particular reason and I sent a ticket in and I never heard a damn thing about why my account was banned. So within a span of about 3-4 years I sent in a total number of 15 tickets and NONE of them had even been touched by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutomer ""service"" representatives. There are also absolutely NO refunds here. Trust me I did try to get my money back from wasting at least $200 on my at the time recently banned account.  The events are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and are recycled every year. You're lucky if you happen to see an event from a few years back and that's what they say is ""New and shiny events"" more like trash that they shined up for you so they could stick it up your♥♥♥♥♥easier. On occasion they'll add a new event but generally it's so boring you'll wish there were no events. Mabinogi makes it now so that there is ALWAYS an event but it just...It just doesn't work.All in all the game just isn't all that fun anymore. I certainly would not recommend it anymore.			"

												I have played mabi from the first generation and on and off for every year, sometimes doing speed runs on different characters. It's not the same as the older versions but it's still good. The client is low spec so you can multitask while playing and the gameplay is reactive and somewhat player skill based early on but at higher levels it might not be as fun. The best part of this mmo is the character customization. In the past I delete all my characters to start over with all the  customization features for free, but I don't know if that works anymore. It's a good mmo to create a character you like and play with.			"

The difficulty in learning skills is also higher for some skills than others, but whatt i enjoy is that there is much more to do. Many mmo's I've played have been nothing more than kill and fetch quest with little story, but luckily mabi has more to it and actually presents its story rather then just t having it in a fetch quest where it's not even necessary to read.

There's tons of quests to do, you don't HAVE to fight if you don't want to, and in general there's an endless stream of content.My only criticism here is that in terms of character appearance, you have to have money if you want to look nice. Clothes and hair and new face options cost actual money. But if that's something you don't care about too much / are willing to pay for, you should definitely try it out. See if you can get friends into it too, if you like it - it's much more fun to play that way.			"

												Its impossible for me not to reccomend mabinogi. Ive been playing the game 0ff-steam for years and ive fallen in love with it over and over again. The game has tons of new features, and even though its old, Nexon keeps it well updated. The Best thing about mabinogi is the community. Nearly everyone is always cheerful and will be kind to you under almost any circumstance. Coming into the game and making a new friend is an amazing feeling because Mabinogi lets you do so much together and really wouldnt be the same alone. It has a unique blend of strategy and real time combat that makes it wonderful in its own little way, along with hundreds of moves and so many ways to keep an enemy off your tail (yes, you can have a tail if you want).Even hardcore gamers would find there own little guilty pleasure in leveling up and getting stronger. The game was updated a while back so now noobs can easily find a foothold in the world of erinn, plus with the game being free, theres really no reason not to give it a try. Theres no limits in this game as to what you want to do and even after playing for so long im still surprised by what i see. So come and send me a friend request. My name is dumgrum nice to meet you.

												This game is fairly awesome, theres been lots of changes since ive started i dont agree with tho that removes the necessity for a few pets but then again, i am an elitest on this game lol, i will admit this game is 100% free to play but... i have dropped over $5000 admititdly just for a large amount of gachapons mainly but also side stuff like self ressurection and reforges, it seems stupid to many people but ive played around 700 hours w/o payign a single dime...  as a single guy with a job and only house bills to pay, i got the money for it :) and honestly is worth every penny imo.The ranking system and social value is pretty high up there tho the only negative thing about the game is that its getting really really easy which i dont see why (other then to accomidate the younger and lazyer generation) i want to see this game move foward with harder dungeons and more expansive content, i dont see why bother to have every map preloaded instead of constant small area rendering, which would correct alot of gltiches (primarily some commerce bugs), save alot of lag and make the game seem more worldy? adventruable? some word like that.I'd love the game even more if they can make it happen with maybe possiable world pvp server or option, as the current ""world pvp"" is rather lame but admidly fun in cities sometimes, i feel theres alot of potential for pvp mini-games and ranking and lots of other stuff as well.Three cheers for the militents and humans that put thier effrort in this game tho!

I just didn’t get anywhere but the training area, whenever I tried to do other things I kept having to go backto the training area because I couldn’t do anything else… and the spiders kept killing me in training so I couldn’t advance, lol… So I was stuck doing the same thing over and over.. After dying 10+ times I said screw it..			"

												      Hi! I've been playing Mabi for 6 years now, but I just started playing through Steam. My name is Buggeroff on Tarlach server, Haeche guild master.  It's a realy good game. most of my family plays it with me. Mabi is easy to play for beginners and can be very challenging for those who get in to the more advanced stuff. (my son started playing at age 12 and is still into it at 16) It was a good game for me (a late bloomer in the gameing world) to cut my teeth on. No matter what else I play, I always come back to Mabinogi. They give us  lots of content updates and events. I always have a ton of stuff to keep me interested and I've met some of my closest friends on this game. I enjoy helping new people. Give it a try, and look me up if you deside on Tarlach server.

												There really isn't an end to this game. It's not like other MMO's where you go out and kill 5 enemies and come back. This has so much of a social aspect, many dungeons and quests to do. It's almost endless, so many generation quests and saga quests. You won't be disappointed by this game!			"

												Something I've been playing since just after the beta, even after nearly 10 years i still find it a good game but nexon as a company is negligent to issues and repeats cheap events rather than fix problems that could revive this games playerbase. i myself love the combat, the fact your forced react to players is exciting, because any player can defeat anyone else if they can manage to outplay them, i have prooved this before with a new character agaisnt someone whos level was nearing 2k, so this is a game where the quote"" anything is possible"" is a valid argument.

												Mabinogi is a very drab game. It advertises endless possibilities and mountains of content, when in reality the only real things you can do involve trading and stabbing bears. The combat is too lopsided, the story is too KAWAII-DESUUUUUU~ and the economy is a huge mess. Dungeons are boasted as in-depth and randomly generated, which they are (kinda). Small enemies can kill you just as quickly as you can kill them, and bosses require a couple of players (or luck, in most cases) to beat, which kills it for me because I like being able to solo most things. Armor does nothing, surprisingly, and you're better off saving your money up for weapons and potions than splurging on armor. There's also a wound system that requires you to use bandages before potions do any good, forcing you to waste even more time. Everything is a grind and nothing is rewarding. Good luck getting anything done. Trust me, you'll need it.			"

												Incredibly fun MMO. I don't have 5 hours of playtime, I have only recently switched to Steam. I've been with this game since Iria came out. While a lot of the good stuff is paid only, they have been doing much better with that, a prime example being the new weapons from the revamps. While the game isn't a graphical masterpiece, it plays very well and the graphics are acceptable. The only thing you'll really need to pay real money for are AoE pets, and you can do good without them.			"

												Honestly the best MMO i've ever played despite its age. I put and invested countless hours into this game off steam (which shows in the lack of hours.) The number one reason why this game isn't as famous as it should be is because it's simply owned by Nexon. The company has ruined many popular titles such as MapleStory, Dungeon Fighter Online, and yes that includes Mabinogi. All games are still popular in korea, but due to the INSANE price differences in the Korea version VS. the NA version cash shops, this MMO constantly has you spending 3x-4x more than an average Korean player. If this game was owned by another company such as Riot Games, or another known good company with a good sense of customer relations, this would easily topple the gaming industry in terms of Fantasy MMOs. Highly recommend if you're going to spend thousands of dollars on this ""f2p"" mmo to try and buy Final Fantasy 14 Online. Yes its subscription, but in the end its a lot cheaper than Nexon's ""f2p"" mmos.			"

												this a great game i have spent hours playing and leveling up the best part is unlike almost every other mmorpg out there there isnt just a set of 4 skills such as warrior, archer, mage, theif your not just limited to a set of 4 or even three and you can chose a skill that isnt even realted to combat i personaly love the adventurer skill since you get the ability to go around and kill things that around whatever level your skill set is at and then after collecting a certion about you can then transform into that animal or monster but i would recamend that you do choose a combat skill first before getting that skill since your gonna need some levels and experance in the the game before you can use that skill properly otherwise your just gonna keep dieing over and over again and thats not fun trust me and i do truly love the rebirths so you can choise more skills to learn (pssst little tip for anyone that hasnt played or hasnt it yet normaly a rebirth resets your level and everything you still keep your money and stuff but your level rests to 1 but i know a way around that so in the rebirth screen when you have your character and its giving you the option to change the gender age right above the gender option there are three little check boxes if you go the first on the left and click it unchecking it that will make it so you dont have your level reset to 1) i really recommend this game to any first time mmorpg player as well as any experianced mmorpg players out there			"

												This game seems clunky and weird at first. It's hard to really get into any mmo, the first time you try it after finding one you enjoy, but Mabinogi has an... aura to it. It has this unique feeling. I've found no other game like this to a T, as you can with many other MMORPG's. I was horribly depressed. This game gave me new life as I found new friends, went on new adventures and found.. a strange living comfort in my new found fantasy life. But now, mabinogi is not what it used to be. It's okay, it's still great by all means, how ever... I can no longer recommend it with every fiber of my being. I say try it. Try it, and see what you can find that is for you. It's your fantasy life. So it's up to you, to find your own joys, your own story, your own friends, your own likes, your own dislikes. This is a game made for YOU, the player. It's a bit pay2win, but none of it is mandatory for certain things. Pay2get pets can come out in certain events, some items can be found in the market for a hefty price either way and if you wait it goes down. It's a good game. It just.. takes a specific type of person to love it. So enjoy it, if you can. If you don't, fret not. There are other games more suited for you. But I myself love mabinogi. I would say, by all means, give it a try. Sure, some sour spots can be found here and there, but honestly, I say go for it. If you DO play, try mari server first. Fact; Alexina is a bad server. It has the worst type of players on it.			"

												I'd say this game has lived quite past its glorious day, but most of its features can be interesting.Firsthand, the crafting system feels a bit more involved, for you actually have to toss-in inputs in order to gain improved results, which is quite an interesting twist on the standard MMORPG's way of rolling with that.The combat system feels a bit awkward at first, but that issue will eventually disappear with time.The main issue I can perceive so far is related to the low server population, but it is quite normal at this advanced stage of existence.Lastly, if you enjoy life skills and some creative class design, this game has plenty of them to entertain you for quite a while.

												I've only just started playing this game but thus far I really like it. A lot of the people playing are pretty friendly as long as you aren't rude and the game is pretty easy to figure out when you get in. The first thing I would want to say though is that going into this I did make 2 characters, one of them was used for learning to play the game, and the other was used to play once I figured the game out. idk if this was a good Idea but I feel like with the first character I was able to make all the mistakes I needed to make while learning and not worry about it affecting the rest of my gameplay experience.That being said it didn't take me long to figure the game out and if you're used to most basic MMO style gameplay then you should be able to figure out a lot of the concepts and UI placement pretty quickly. When I started I played as a basic human warrior and I have to say that I had a lot of fun with the combat. The fighting style with close combat is very fun and it feels like when you're hitting things you're actually doing something. The second talent I tried was magic because I thought it might be kinda fun to use magic at a distance and then beat my enemies down with my sword when they got close. I do have to say that to me personally I didn't think that the magic felt very rewarding to me. It seemed like I was just kinda poking things and making them angry and I found myself using my swords a lot more often.Another thing I noticed that I actually really liked is that you can go anywhere. If you want to wander into an area with mobs that are much stronger than you, the game won't tell you that you can't. I mean you will obviously get murdered going in there but I feel like it makes the game more fun when exploring because you don't know how powerful a mob is compared to you in a new area until you attack it. The sense of exploration and not knowing if you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you the second you attack something makes the game a lot more fun for me personally.Again this is all low level beginner experiences of mine and the gameplay could become much better as you become higher level. I feel that this game is probably going to become kind of an addiction for me but this is also the first 2 weeks of me playing this game. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys MMO style games and loves exploration in games.			"

												If you're looking for a fantasy life game that isn't the sims, play this first. This game is really fun with friends. Get friends, play with them. I've been playing on and off since I was about 10 or 11. I am now 16, still fun but the game has changed more than I would have liked it to. The social aspect is really awesome, the game isn't really suit for pvp unless you're dueling or have your trans pvp activated. One of the only things I don't like about it now is how it seems that it is beginning to die out of players, Alexina still says ""new server"" even though it came out before I even started playing, Nexon made it incredibly easier for new players to get a hold of the game if they're under level 1k (now new people wont know the struggle of having to wait for weeks just to rebirth). Other than the nostalgia of being a kid that it gives me, I have to say it is indeed one of the best MMO games I've ever played since it hits the dot when it says ""fantasy life.""			"

Despite its flaws this game is very fun to play. It gives you something unique to you if you have the cash to make yourself whatever you want and the extreme patience to become used to the UI. Its an addiction but its an addiction I am proud to have.			"

												An MMO I sank way too much time into in middle school. Still a Korean grindfest, but it does it in a pretty unique way. If you like this sort of thing, go for it. If MMORPGs aren't your thing, this won't really change your mind.			"

												I have played mabi from the first generation and on and off for every year, sometimes doing speed runs on different characters. It's not the same as the older versions but it's still good. The client is low spec so you can multitask while playing and the gameplay is reactive and somewhat player skill based early on but at higher levels it might not be as fun. The best part of this mmo is the character customization. In the past I delete all my characters to start over with all the  customization features for free, but I don't know if that works anymore. It's a good mmo to create a character you like and play with.			"

												I enjoy it, but the populace is rather small, and people don't talk much which is a problem since some skills and quest require you to have a party. The difficulty in learning skills is also higher for some skills than others, but whatt i enjoy is that there is much more to do. Many mmo's I've played have been nothing more than kill and fetch quest with little story, but luckily mabi has more to it and actually presents its story rather then just t having it in a fetch quest where it's not even necessary to read.

												Great story lots to do, overwhelmingly so. Would  highly suggest playing it... If not for the major need of a revamped world, better game engine, adressed issues for bugs and glitches, oh and the lack of service and investigation for major issues such as Characters being unable to finish a quest-line. The wiki is not a cure-all, nor is it an excuse to provide awful customer service.Aparently self-promoted sales werent enough so now they're using steam to promote a newby care pack. Lol			"

												Fairly large learning curve. I put most of my time into it from Nexons website, but logged quite a few hours on here as well.If anything it had one of the best communities of any game I had ever played. With tons of classes and quite a few people to talk to. Literally spent my first week playing just screwing around in town with people having a good time. Its a pretty relaxed game, or at least it was.Right now its mostly just people hanging out in town and showing off their cash shop items, chatting, and maybe dueling. Which is OK, but no one runs dungeons anymore, most just buy stuff from the cash shop. Its kind of hard to recommend playing since the community pretty much stopped doing any form of dungeons etc unless you get to the much higher levels of play where people are constantly doing dailys etc. Its also gotten quite a bit taken over by a lot of kids bregging about cash shop items and not doing anything else.Other then those few issues however, I have had more fun on this game than any other MMO I have ever played and Nexon fixed a few quality of life issues even though the game doesn't run all that great. One of which is their rebirth system in which you reset your level down to 1, but retain all your ability points (used to level up whatever you feel like training at the time: cooking, fishing, warrior, archer, cook, tailor, lots of things.) Rebirthing helps you level up and get the ability points fast again, and now free players can do this much more often. Once a week I believe which is usually pretty perfect.One of the best parts about the game however is that you can pretty much play however you want. I was exploring the desert for a few days, mastered some cooking, then killed some beasties in a few dungeons. Its pretty crazy what you can screw around with, and even though the community went a bit downhill, its still really good; especially compared to many other MMO's out there.If you are looking for a fairly relaxed game with tons of options and a pretty cool community, and don't mind the constant spam of people playing clannad/sword art music. Then download this and get to chatting and dungeon crawling. Its a lot of fun when you get some people to hang out with.Sorry if this review is a bit jumbled up, not a lot of time and its my first one. Best of luck in the world of Mabinogi!			"

												This game is pretty great. The graphics are out-dated, but the community is good and generally helpful. There is no P2W concept, you can buy pets which can help you carry loot and junk, but they aren't going to win any battles for you. The learning curve is there and noticeable, but once you get a grasp of the game it's easy to work with. It's an overall fun game, and has loads of potential and variety for you to look into. But some patience might be required, and having and making friends to play with will certainly make the experience more fun. The story is also great and in-depth and all the characters you meet have some fleshy story to them.All in all I would rate this game a strong 8/10,  if it had better graphics and more streamlined combat like say Tera or something then I would say this is probably the closest to a perfect MMO you'll find.

												After 3000+ hours, I should be recommending Mabinogi to other players or those who are interested in it. However it may be, feel free if you want to spend time on the game because after all it's a one-of-the-kind MMO's and nothing really compared to it at the time. Though if you are wondering why I don't recommend it......it's because it's now lost many of the great qualities of what made this game most enjoyable.After all these years of playing, I can now say I wouldn't recommend it due to several changes.For veterans and newcomers alike, you'll understand that this game can be punishing, gameplay wise and economically wise. Learning how to play was a little difficult. When we got used to it, there was more to it and that was the fun part. Making those mistakes but learning from them and getting better and better. It's now spoonfed to you in the early levels when it comes to exploring and developing your character. Grinding is still the same as it is back then only the hard part is the later levels.When it gets too tough for, that's where microtransactions come in. They are literally the game changers including what you can get from exclusive events. That also means the economy has a massive overhaul due to the ease of obtaining the items.Over the past years I played it on and off. When I played it, I would literally spend so much time on this and when I took a break it would be about one or two months. I enjoyed playing music scores made by other players, jamming to those songs, questing with randoms and just chilling in Dunbarton with random players. The community was great. The keyword is ""was"".You still have great people and those who help out but now it's taken over by a lot of terrible players in terms of verbal abusers, scammers, hackers and griefers usually as a wolf in sheep's clothing. It's also come to the point where power balancing is ridiculous. One class that started out as mediocre becomes the strongest thing in the game and then gets screwed over again as the cycle repeats.Not only these issues aside, nowadays Nexon's recently gotten lacklustre with their customer support. I've noticed this in other games because for example 'Maplestory' they had banned a majority of players due to being exposed to a hacker and there was no way to get back your account at all. If you saw a hacker in Mabinogi or someone who was literally abusing the system and everyone else, they don't care. As long as they continue to get money for their ridiculously overpriced things then there's no support for you.In honesty, I enjoyed the game a lot and I do want to recommend it but it's become more difficult to and I don't plan on returning to Mabinogi with all my time spent there. It's bittersweet at best.If you do have the time (or/and money) to spend on this game and want to invest in this game because you are interested, I won't stop you. If you don't because of what I had mentioned or you simply don't have the time then I suggest looking elsewhere.			"

												If you're looking for a fantasy life game that isn't the sims, play this first. This game is really fun with friends. Get friends, play with them. I've been playing on and off since I was about 10 or 11. I am now 16, still fun but the game has changed more than I would have liked it to. The social aspect is really awesome, the game isn't really suit for pvp unless you're dueling or have your trans pvp activated. One of the only things I don't like about it now is how it seems that it is beginning to die out of players, Alexina still says ""new server"" even though it came out before I even started playing, Nexon made it incredibly easier for new players to get a hold of the game if they're under level 1k (now new people wont know the struggle of having to wait for weeks just to rebirth). Other than the nostalgia of being a kid that it gives me, I have to say it is indeed one of the best MMO games I've ever played since it hits the dot when it says ""fantasy life.""			"

												I'd say this game has lived quite past its glorious day, but most of its features can be interesting.Firsthand, the crafting system feels a bit more involved, for you actually have to toss-in inputs in order to gain improved results, which is quite an interesting twist on the standard MMORPG's way of rolling with that.The combat system feels a bit awkward at first, but that issue will eventually disappear with time.The main issue I can perceive so far is related to the low server population, but it is quite normal at this advanced stage of existence.Lastly, if you enjoy life skills and some creative class design, this game has plenty of them to entertain you for quite a while.

												This game has got me coming back over and over again, not only because it's a good MMO, but the friends that you make and the relationships you build through the impressive social community are outstanding. If you only played this game for the dungeons and etc, you're missing out on quite a bit. The character customization isn't the best, but they make up for it in gear. The game itself has a anime style touch to it and even had a Sword Art Online event at one point (Which I have Kirito's outfit, swords, and wings now ^.^). I think out of anything in this game, my favorite aspect is their music playing. You can play an instrument and even write your own music (if you know how to do it with MML). If you ever want to try out a game that has a nice social aspect aswell as combat, try out Mabinogi. Mabinogi is best played with friends or friends made along the way <3Although it says I've only played 0.2 hours. I have played much longer than that off of steam.			"

												There really isn't an end to this game. It's not like other MMO's where you go out and kill 5 enemies and come back. This has so much of a social aspect, many dungeons and quests to do. It's almost endless, so many generation quests and saga quests. You won't be disappointed by this game!			"

												This game is fabulous and bad at the same time. If there was a neutral button toward a review, this would be the one game I'd use it on. Here are some pro's & con's.Con's first, cause' it will grab your attention at the very finest.PS: , I mention this later but, I have around 2500 hours on this game and I've played for four years. Don't take my hours on the steam platform for granted please :)Cons:*BAD support, as far as I know, only half the people in their customer/tech support system actually do their job.*Money-hungry company, this game is 'considered' a pay to win due to the mere impossibility of doing things without money near-end game, but it's still a great experience otherwise.*Not much customization, in outfits, near early-game, which is rather considerably okay how they deal with it. Not really a con.//Some of these con's deal with the company that franchises it, the gameplay is, heavily, HEAVILY, different.Pros:*Epic combinations of skills that will leave you on your seat when you happen to get that unexpected boss kill ;D*Best community out there for a [mainly] free2play game.*Grand amounts of customization near mid-game, leading to epic skill combos, neat outfits, tools..*DUAL WIELDING, do I HAVE to explain this? They handle it so well.*It doesn't feel like a grind in the beginning or middle, near late game is where grindy stuff happens.*Memorable times...!*A VARIETY of amazing skills such as fishing, making a campfire, cooking even! These were added to make the game more realistic and overall bondworthy toward. It also makes some killer picnic's.*Realistic-like PVP , or, in this case, Duels. You literally walk up to someone, ask them if they want to duel. A menu comes up, you set the pre-requisites straight forward and get dueling. You aren't FORCED to do it either, and you can make good friends off of it.*Graphics are easy to render, a lower-end / mid-end computer could easily run 30-100FPS. The game was made around 2000-something if I recall. The graphics still look amazing though.//*Death penalty system is not degradeful, hated, or anything in particular. It is annoying when you die, you get Nao stones to revive on full health sometimes though, and even if you do die, you don't lose anything. There is a chance when you die you may lose your gear if its expensive and not blessed by a certain item, but you can get it back at a town hall for a .. 'reasonable yet sometimes a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ kind of price.//*And finally, its NOT a rage game. Well, not easily alas. Sometimes there are mobs that can truly p1ss off someone but other than that, you don't lose very much.//\\Oh and, don't take my hours for granted. This game was just recently platformed on steam, it used to be on the companies website, which doesn't, as you may know, transfer hours over to here.I've played Mabinogi for four years! Highly inactive, but I at least have 2500 hours on the game and I've witnessed all the stuff they've done on it.//\\This is a more TL:DR Version::!!//\\There are plenty more cons to the game, but they are outweighed heavily by the amount of pros this game contains. The community is so well knitted together that even a child could have fun without any pervs or foul language to watch out for. It's fun, engaging, and most of all, it's made for a community. You can manage epic combos in combat, you can even have pets. Its pretty cool, and is definitely worth trying.However, the support service/s are typically bad, but you can still manage a refund if you didn't get something you payed for. They are money hungry , as they support many different games imported from Japan, and I can understand that. When they ask for too much money though, its pretty noticable. Back on the topic of the game though, there isn't much customization in the beginning, so its kind of boring. If you keep on going though, you'll find it pretty epic overall.--//...An even more TL;DR version..!! ;//\\Fun / Engaging game; but has a bad support service / company. It is a near pay to win at the end, but it is still very fun. It's also very involved with the community, most people are friendly and you don't have to watch out for swear-a-holics. A 9 year old could play this and learn to be kind from the community, most of the time.//OVERALL SCORE, the moment you've been waiting for..I give this game an 8.5 / 10  !!The reason I knocked off 1.5 points was rather simple, just the bad service and company it is owned by in America and the 'noticable yet not overkill' hunger for money they desire to keep the game rolling. Here is a more in-depth explanation.+1 - Great graphic design, even for a game made near 2000. It can also handle lower-end computers well.+3 - Epic community for a free-to-play game, it is very well knitted together, its hard to rip apart. Very hard.+4.5 - Amazing combat system, PVP, and gameplay in general. Has a killer storyline too.-1.5 - Aside from all that, the game has a bad support system and is a mere pay to win near the end. You can still have a great time though.Thanks for reading through this, I hope I've told you the most I could about this fabulous game.-~Kon			"

It's got a bunch of inspirations it draws from, Harvest Moon being a primary. It's easy enough to solo play if you don't like the community, but when I have joined up with other players the player base has been wonderful and helpful. Very fun, if a little gridy.			"

												I have played Mabinogi on and off for years, yet it still is always able to draw me back into the game sometime down the road with new interesting content. Although I have only played 200ish hours on steam, I have played since before the release of ""Pioneers of Iria"" (appx. late 2008 - early '09). The Pros: - many many skills - no specific class restrictions ( you can be a dual-sword-wielding, fireball-ing, gunslinging, musical chef if you want ) - most items can be dyed to what colors you wish - Most, if not all, storylines have been streamlined - Addition of Talents, which are like titles for how proficient you are in certain skill sets (i.e. combat, magic, music etc.) - The Saga storylines give your character a chance to be a part of ""episodes"", like a tv series. - Continually seems to come out with events / updatesThe Cons: - Pets are extremely hard to get these days without paying cash - In some areas, on some channels, the LAG IS REAL. - Cash shop items are EXPENSIVE. For example, buying a 15,000 Nx pet? That will be $15 US. - The economy of gold seems to be rather pricy on certain, desirable items. ( 20 million+ gold for a set of ""eh"" wings ) - Dyes are expensive. Overall, I'd recommend Mabinogi with a 8.75/10. There are some issues, but aren't there issues with every mmo out there? And although this game is ""old"" ( 2006 release ), it's still alive and kicking.			"

												Among all of the MMOs and online multiplayer games I have played over the years, Mabinogi is truly a one of a kind game. Originally debuted in 2004 as a pay 2 play and transitioned to a free 2 play in closed beta, Mabinogi started off small with only a few towns and already had a ton of features that existed today. Though my only gripe as that even though it's a free to play game, you really get the benefits of the game by paying out of the wallet. Even though people say you don't need to. Over the years Mabinogi has tried to solve this problem by elimating some premium services and letting more free 2 play features into the mix.Now compared to 2004 there is always a lot of content. People who say who say it's ""a generic MMO"" haven't really looked deep into the game's mechanics and features. It's rare you find a game where you can use your own music in battle, or find a ton of minigames like you'd find in here.Still that doesn't mean that between 2004 and now this is now flawless. I still gripe about inventory space for free 2 play players. You most likely will be forced to get a pet eventually for lack of inventory space or buy their VIP service for more bags. Also their durability feature on equips is most frustrating, especially when it's not 100% chance that you might repair an equip completely. Some times even with a high-end computer lag might hit you as well, but that's unfortunately on the server end of the game. Also some quests can be a pain to do alone.But all of those gripes don't take away from the fun of the game. I highly reccomend playing the game through it's main and side quests for at least a couple weeks and join a guild and see if you are still enjoying the game.IGN: YuenRuairi server			"

												I'd recommend this game if the homestead houses were actual houses, and that'd be really nice for socializing, but they're not, soooo ♥♥♥♥ IT.The crafting in the game is beautiful, as is the lack of real class systems.  However, I don't particularly like the ""bonus exp for talent"" system.  Essentially, you now pick a class and when you do tasks from that class, you get more exp.Despite all this, I still recommend this game.  If you like the Anime art style, it's perfectly acceptable to enjoy.  If you don't MIND the art style and would like to play a game with interesting craft and harvesting systems with the ability to master every task in the game, then I recommend it.  However, if you find Anime grating at all on your nerves, you will puke 3 minutes into the game.			"

												Despite what my playing time says, it only represents the amount of time an nxsteam.exe application error sat on my screen.I haven't been able to even get past this by launching the game through Steam.However I am still going to give this game a thumbs up, because I have been able to play by starting the game directly from the installation folder without any hassle.I've spent a good 3-4 hours playing as Ninja Elf by the time I write this, and I have to say that once you get the hang of the somewhat awkward controls, it's actually a lot of fun!Its colourful and cute looking, the community is friendly and helpful (so far), and there is tons of stuff to do, to collect, and see.It's even got odd looking cats!The graphics quality might not please everybody, but hey, the game's free to play after all.Haven't encountered anything so far that forces you to pay with real money to get certain items, which is always nice.The only downside I have is that buying outfits can get REALLY expensive, but I suppose that's one of the reasons you will keep playing on. :pIf you're looking for a fun, free MMORPG, give this a go!Just be mindful precious real life time might get wasted in fast quantities...

												Very fun plot line to play through and very addicting game ... though in the end game there is barely anything besides repeating commernceing, replaying the Saga plot lines and PvP. .... Well the "" open PVP "" system of paladin vs Dark Knight and Elf vs gaint is very broken meaning you die once and you basicly lose conintuously until you get to a healer's house to heal up but also you hit at 100% power to the other person thus you are doing hundreds if not throsands of dmg per hit and the max HP is only 1500 w/o trans anyways which only will bring it up as much as 1850 hp but stil that is a 4 hit kill and you revive with 5hp and the rest of it wound that cannot be restored with a normal HP potion. This is how that kind of PVP is broken. PVP via the Dualing system is better and what most ppl on Mabinogi use now as it lasts longer you do ussualy 1s but i ahve seen it go up to like 12 dmg some times when on 0% though good question how they got to 12 dmg when it should have been all 1 dmg hits. The plot is getting longer still and that is good and they are still tweaking it so the older skills are not always worse than the newer ones which i  also see as a good thing			"

												Wellp. I just broke 1.6k hours. Recorded On Steam at least. I've been playing this game long before it was available on steam and I gotta say its one of my faveorite MMOs out there. The learning curve is steep and the engine is defiantly showing its age (over 10 years now) but it still has the core of what mmo's used to be like ages ago.  The sandbox elements are pretty good and despite the change of directors over the years shifting the design away from what it originally was I still find myself coming back.If you were to try this game you need to prepare to look over it's short comings due to the dated engine and be willing to learn it's systems as they are very different from other games and are not explained too well in game.

												Garbage piled up on more garbage built upon the sub-par foundations of more garbage. Its not a true RPG, but rather  a life simulater, with combat being a means to collect materials and money to buy pots and brooms and other such things. Its incredibly grind heavy, the enviroments ,though cell shaded and quite pleasnt, have a mixture of both High Level enemies mixed in with Low Level monsters that punishes players for trying to explore, griefers and goldsellers are abound, and the game actively pushed you to buy needless garbage. The only redeeming quailty I can say about the game is that the promotional character has a huuuuge pair of breasts, complete with exaggerated breast physics. All in all, for a true RPG experience rather than a Life simulater about making gloves shearing sheep, I suggest Vindictus, a prequal to Mabinogi thats based on the source engine and has an emphasis on combat.

												Love, love, love this game! This game has an exuberant amount of life skills, providing plenty of hours of entertainment. Life skills range from the standard mining/weapon crafting to cooking and music composition. I personally enjoy any game that allows for a lot of gathering of needed materials and this game surely provides. The fighting system is very involved, so don't expect a point a click. Defense is key to making it through dungeons. They are constantly updating their jobs and quests. The best part is the rebirth system. This allows you to start from lvl 1 while still retaining previous skill levels and an overall level as well as being able to change jobs. One week your a cook, the next a gunslinger. Out of all the free mmos I've played, this one definitely allows for greater amount of freedom than others. The quest and storylines are creative and unique. My only complaint (and it's huge), is that any tume there is an update I am suddenly unable to play the game. I can uninstall and reinstall the game but it doesn't seem to help. I have to wait (usually up to months later) to play the game. This has been happening to me for years; even before the game came to Steam and I have yet to still resolve the problem. Sadly though, the game is just too good for me to stay away permenantly.			"

												This game has got me coming back over and over again, not only because it's a good MMO, but the friends that you make and the relationships you build through the impressive social community are outstanding. If you only played this game for the dungeons and etc, you're missing out on quite a bit. The character customization isn't the best, but they make up for it in gear. The game itself has a anime style touch to it and even had a Sword Art Online event at one point (Which I have Kirito's outfit, swords, and wings now ^.^). I think out of anything in this game, my favorite aspect is their music playing. You can play an instrument and even write your own music (if you know how to do it with MML). If you ever want to try out a game that has a nice social aspect aswell as combat, try out Mabinogi. Mabinogi is best played with friends or friends made along the way <3Although it says I've only played 0.2 hours. I have played much longer than that off of steam.			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, but after several grueling hours of dicking with the interface and learning to play the game, I realized that I really (REALLY) dislike the camera control and mechanics. You control your character much like any other point and click game, but Mabinogi has the audacity to not let me zoom out far enough to allow me to see all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I want to see. Good end user experience? Nope.Other than the fact that the game was uncomfortable to play, it has installs, starts, and uninstalls pretty well.			"

												Mabinogi is very unique of a MMO. There are tons of skills you cna learn and master that are used differently than the usually mmo instead of slamming buttons you need to use each one depending on what your enemy is using to counter theirs or to go for the opening with a high inpact attack. every item is color changeable allowing you to dye your outfits and armor to be unique from every one else in the game and tons of customization options for your character to be a hero instead of Knight # 1087. Be unique! be yourself play mabinogi!			"

												Out of all the MMOs I've played, this one is the only one I keep coming back to. The levelling system is unique, and grinding is more common in skill training than leveling. The only downside of the game is the company that runs it; with lacklister customer service, lack of in-game moderator prescence, and the ignorance the company has when it comes to problems, its a bit surprising that I come back still. Overall, the game is great, the hosting company needs work.			"

												I feel like this game deserves a true review as it was such a major part of my life as a gamer a few years back. Though I haven't played it much as of late, I can honestly say that this was the best MMORPG that I have ever played. I was initially brought in due to the charming art style. As a child, I figured this would a simple, cute rpg that anyone could play with ease. While I was right about the easiness of getting into the game, the whole system as a whole is beyond amazing. The point and click system that was used early on was never cumbersome like other games I had played before then. Combat and movement felt fluid most of the time though there was the occasional moment of confusion on where my character was actually going.As for the story, I never really focused too much on the story as a child, I simply went through dungeons in order to level up. But after going back through some parts, I found the story rather charming. I was able to feel somewhat invested into the story despite feeling more like some mercenary that the REAL main characters used to do the dirty work. However, I didn't mind this too much as I still had ties to certain characters.Anyways, this is a game that one can easily get into; The community is mostly friendly, the controls work fine, and the general overworld is beautiful! My only major problem is that the economy seems to be in a horrible state ever since I played. Player shops rarely have items that anybody can afford. Though most items they sell aren't essential so it won't effect your experience much.My Overall Score: 8/10			"

												I've played Mabinogi On and Off since at least 2008 .   and my only problem with it is the scope of it all.    It beautiful without being taxing on the system. there is so much to do that you could play for hours and only sctratch the surface.  whether you explore, craft or dungeon run you'll mostly get bored because you can't decide what to do.   While there is a questline you aren't tied to it. the cash while expensive is entirely optional (except for more charcter cards) but since rebirthing has changed that's not a problem as you can evolve you charcter however you want.

												Definitely pay to win, but if you don't mind a little grind you can do basically everything without paying a dime. To a lot of people that means a lot, but not so much to me. What I find most appealing about this game is the classless system, you can make your character anything and at any point you can change your mind and pick up something else. You aren't limited to one type of weapon or skill set based on the race you play or the weapon and skill set you choose to start with. Over time they have improved the tutorials at the beginning of the game to make it easier for new players to get started and the community in this game always seems to have a friendly vibe. Overall, it's a great game and I would recommend it. If you're hesitant about it, it's free and trying it can't hurt. It runs on low spec systems fairly well and has a good look to it even though it's aging as an MMO. What you won't find here are cutting edge graphics and animations, but it makes up for it in gameplay. Not saying the animations or graphics are bad, they are very good considering the generation of MMOs this game comes from.			"

												Quite possibly one of the most annoying games I have ever played. Getting past the passwords for Nexon and Mabinogi popup and hotscreen to even play are ridiculous and getting your first skill is beyond annoying. I chose archer and the targeting system has you pressing multiple keys and resetting multiple times for each attack which is stupid. You dont get much of a character choice or pet choice unless you pay for facial expressions and get ""tickets"" for all the other extras. So for such a dinky little game with awkward controls and lousy targeting system it isnt worth a penny of my money. Glad this was a free to play or I would be upset.			"

												Wellp. I just broke 1.6k hours. Recorded On Steam at least. I've been playing this game long before it was available on steam and I gotta say its one of my faveorite MMOs out there. The learning curve is steep and the engine is defiantly showing its age (over 10 years now) but it still has the core of what mmo's used to be like ages ago.  The sandbox elements are pretty good and despite the change of directors over the years shifting the design away from what it originally was I still find myself coming back.If you were to try this game you need to prepare to look over it's short comings due to the dated engine and be willing to learn it's systems as they are very different from other games and are not explained too well in game.

												Warning: This game, IMO is a WoW killer! Why? Well for many reasons, some more than others. Including:1. The rebirth system: This mechanic is actually the one main factor in all of this. Once you reach the age of 20 years old (Years in this game are weeks IRL), You can rebirth your character back to Level 1. I like this because it allows you to try different playstyles. If you're smart you'll actually invest in a playstyle that you like.2. The class system: This is a trip. See, the funny thing is, You actually don't need to restrict yourself to one playstyle. The only equipment restriction you have is in terms of clothing/armor. Classes instead give you access to learning certain skills that are exclusive to that class, as well as certain buffs. For example, The Mage class allows you to have an INT boost and extra Mana. This is also true for the Generational questline.3.Life Skills: These are unique in that they require a month of two of discipline to master! The variety is in this game. For once Devs kept their promise.Overall 8.5/10			"

												Mabinogi is a complex fantasy world with a vast array of customization, from combat skills to life skills, and highly varied levels of equipments, abilities, and upgrades. My only criticism is that it is easy to lose to the ""freedom"" that the game gives you, and not be able to focus on a goal because of the willingness to explore so many different areas. There are a bunch of tutorials and beginner boosts to get you going and the many seasonal events keep the game fresh. Gachapon style awards in the cash shop are a pain, but every once in a while... you may get something nice. maybe. The story is very deep, so pay attention! Its definitely well thought out and well worth your time.			"

												Mabinogi is a very open ended MMORPG with multiple main quests to play, lots of dungeons and events, lots of weapons and cool swag to snag, and lots of NX goodies... which thankfully isn't as required with the new updates. It's F2P, more so than ever these days actually. The game still suffers from lag, but it always has suffered from it. I blame the largeness of the game and the Fergus maintaned servers that are probably older to begin with. The game has customization that was almost unheard of at the time of it's creation (which is what really drew me in), and it still is pretty massive in terms of how unique you can make and build yourself.Lastly, an absolute blast with friends. It can get a bit boring and tedious alone, but find a few friends who play in real life, or find some friendly faces in the game, and you are in for a great time.Original circa 2012: This has got to be the best MMORPG I've ever played, sooo much fun with friends!

												Although my steam says i only have 19-20 hrs on this game, that is FAR from the truth. i've been playing since beta, and just yesterday got it on steam. this game is one of, if not the, best mmorpg out there. There is absolutely endless possibilities as to what you can do in this game. Though you can't open pvp, there is plenty more to offer. I recommend to anybody who likes fantasy mmo's, or just rpg's in general.			"

												Pros:Do what you want- This game has so many skills the player can learn, both combat and lifestyle. What I really like about this is that if you are a warrior and you want to learn magic, of course you have to level it up but you don't lose your warrior skills or have to change to a different ""class"" like in other games. just switch weapons and there you go.  Combat- Rock, paper, scissors. Although that is much more engaging than other games where you just point and  click. Art Style- cute child friendly anime themeCommunity- one of the only mmos i know where random people would give an absolute stranger some items if they are new to the game. Even spend time explaining/ helping that person out if they have questions. This is from my own experience, results may vary.For new players- After making a new account, you do start with 6 character slots. Although if you are a returning player that made an account before this update, you are stuck with 1 (or 3 depending if you got the human, elf, and giant cards for free).Cons: (personal opinion)Combat- pretty slow pace since combat is more strategy than button mashing which might not go well for fast paced action lovers. Besides that my only issue is that the combat isn't very friendly to 1 versus crouds. you may counterattack one enemy but if another attacks on at the same time, it gets annoying. Then if you have enemy archers in mix, be prepared to just sit there stun locked.Graphics- I do like anime themed games and this isn't really a con, it's just that i wish they would update the models and animation to something that isn't early 2000s. Cash Shop- Im not sure since I dont look at the cash shop much but from what I can tell, most of the cash shop items are PURELY FOR AESTHETICS which i have absolutely no problem with. I dont this this game is anywhere close to pay to win which would make sense since I think this game is more social than competative. My only problem was that the ""style tab"" (armor put in the armor/ inventory tab effects defensive stats, armor put in the style tab only effects what your character looks like) which is usually free in other games you have to pay for in this one. Also once ingame, you only have like 10 costume sets to pick from everything else is cashshop or event. Grinding- SInce this game is more social than competative, there is no rush to become stronger than another person making grinding pointless. But if you are a person that wants to level their skills as fast as possible BE PREPARED, it will take a while.			"

												If you're looking for a fantasy life game that isn't the sims, play this first. This game is really fun with friends. Get friends, play with them. I've been playing on and off since I was about 10 or 11. I am now 16, still fun but the game has changed more than I would have liked it to. The social aspect is really awesome, the game isn't really suit for pvp unless you're dueling or have your trans pvp activated. One of the only things I don't like about it now is how it seems that it is beginning to die out of players, Alexina still says ""new server"" even though it came out before I even started playing, Nexon made it incredibly easier for new players to get a hold of the game if they're under level 1k (now new people wont know the struggle of having to wait for weeks just to rebirth). Other than the nostalgia of being a kid that it gives me, I have to say it is indeed one of the best MMO games I've ever played since it hits the dot when it says ""fantasy life.""			"

												I'd say this game has lived quite past its glorious day, but most of its features can be interesting.Firsthand, the crafting system feels a bit more involved, for you actually have to toss-in inputs in order to gain improved results, which is quite an interesting twist on the standard MMORPG's way of rolling with that.The combat system feels a bit awkward at first, but that issue will eventually disappear with time.The main issue I can perceive so far is related to the low server population, but it is quite normal at this advanced stage of existence.Lastly, if you enjoy life skills and some creative class design, this game has plenty of them to entertain you for quite a while.

												Despite the amount of hours shown on my Steam account, I have played Mabi for the past 4 years through Nexon. And, I can tell you, it has been one of the best experiences ever.When I discovered Mabinogi through a friend, I was doubtful. I never really liked RPGs other than the FF series, but this game made me change my mind. Yes, it does have its bugs at times, and can lag a lot if you do not have a top notch computer, but the adventure and vast world make it all worth the while. Mabi has a very, VERY big world which has been growing for the past few years, so you'll never be bored by the everchanging scenery. There are literally an unlimited amount of quests to help you level up until you reach (probably, unsure since I haven't bothered to level very much) Lvl 900+. It is also extremely addictive if you have friends who are willing to play with you regularly. Most people on Mabi are friendly, so asking for help and befriending strangers are easy.In all, I would give this game a 9.5/10.			"

												This anime mmorpg is one of the most funnest games to play. If you like anime and rpg then this is your type of game. Its not a pay to win but it is to pay to look stylish. You can also earn your stuff but if you don't have the patience to earn your stuff then you can buy with real money. Overall this game is great!			"

												A game I keep coming back to over the years - definitely a unique game worth playing.I will say that after finishing the generation quests and mastering all the abilities  you want to, there eventually comes a point where there is little to do.. you become a little overpowered and any new content is a breeze. Still fun nevertheless to just socialize or live that fantasy anime life you could otherwise never live >:D			"

												Definitely one of the best MMO experiences I've had. Mabinogi allowed me the freedom to♥♥♥♥♥♥around, to explore and discover things on my own. It won't hold your hand a ton but that's not to say it's brutally difficult. You really just do find your own way in its world.I had to leave it behind cold-turkey because I got addicted for nearly a month straight. It was just so cool to do trade runs, gather materials for crafting, attempt and often fail dungeons because I suck at combat... if I recall correctly the last thing I was doing was collecting creatures so that I could transform into them.I met a lot of interesting folks. One player posed as a dog and just barked and followed me around for a day. He helped a friend and I complete a tough dungeon and generally made that day's experience a ton of fun.The game is a bit antiquated in some respects but I was easily able to look past that and have a good time.Give it a fair try, maybe with a couple of friends, or make a couple of new ones in there. Or go solo if that's what you really want to do, maybe take pictures and do a blog about your journey.Just settle on down and play yourself some Mabinogi, bro. Enjoy it.			"

												this a great game i have spent hours playing and leveling up the best part is unlike almost every other mmorpg out there there isnt just a set of 4 skills such as warrior, archer, mage, theif your not just limited to a set of 4 or even three and you can chose a skill that isnt even realted to combat i personaly love the adventurer skill since you get the ability to go around and kill things that around whatever level your skill set is at and then after collecting a certion about you can then transform into that animal or monster but i would recamend that you do choose a combat skill first before getting that skill since your gonna need some levels and experance in the the game before you can use that skill properly otherwise your just gonna keep dieing over and over again and thats not fun trust me and i do truly love the rebirths so you can choise more skills to learn (pssst little tip for anyone that hasnt played or hasnt it yet normaly a rebirth resets your level and everything you still keep your money and stuff but your level rests to 1 but i know a way around that so in the rebirth screen when you have your character and its giving you the option to change the gender age right above the gender option there are three little check boxes if you go the first on the left and click it unchecking it that will make it so you dont have your level reset to 1) i really recommend this game to any first time mmorpg player as well as any experianced mmorpg players out there			"

												In the past, it was a great game that pushed for community.  As it grew, it became more and more solo focused.  The combat system was designed to be slow paced.  Would definitely recommend this game for those who enjoy developing their characters into a one-man killing machine.  Or those who just love fashion, or looking cute, or love to afk in towns.Recommendations for in-game:- Number 1 thing to do is: Visit the wiki, get an idea of which path you would want to start with.- Start by focusing on your life skills.  They will improve your combat abilities through passive means.- Rank each skill up one by one so that you can achieve Rank 1 in each.- Take advantage of your newbie status by resetting your Rank 1 skills so that you have more AP to rank another skill. (Recommended since you will be free to rank your skill back to 1 without training again)- Talk casually with people, ask and let them lord over you as if you need shelter from an invisible enemy. (There are good people who are understanding and make recommendations for skill paths or training methods, others will try to shove their methods down your throat)The Good (presently):- Game is largely solo-able since a large part of the community seems consist of isolated groups.- Story line is ok if you don't care how they butcher some mythological characters.- Combat is unique, inbetween fast and slow pace.  Used to run on a Rock-Paper-Scissors sort.- Life skills are extremely tedious, but is also the most rewarding.- Large variety of pets.- Huge map filled with life.The Bad (presently):- Community seems to be extremely immature and isolated.  Many are obessessed with PvP.- Skills are in no-way balanced for PvP while patches try improve the PvP scene.- Heavy on the Pay-to-win scale.  Pets are now stacked with beneficial buffs or attacks when summoned. (almost game breaking)- Group are hard to find for dungeons or challenges for new players.  Not many are willing to have a character that isn't stacked in their groups.- Latest Patches have made their gorgeous map into nothing worth exploring (very little reason to head out there and kill mobs)			"

												I've been a longtime player before this game was made available to steam, so here's some of my thoughts for you all:- If you're looking for a different mmo to settle down in  with good social AND combat aspects, consider playing this one. It's a great mmo to return to; especially if you're into long term commitment. There is a reason why this game's catchphrase is something akin to 'live your own life.' Every single skill you upgrade contributes towards the growth of your character.- There is no class system. There's specific skills filed under skillsets. Your role in combat is loosely determined by what skills you prioritize in ranking up. It's purely up to you how you want to play the game.- You can literally be every class if you wanted to.- Combat can take getting used to, but flows together well. You're allowed to be creative in your playstyle.			"

												Other than having to re-download for steam, this is one of my favorite MMORPGs of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone with little or more MMORPG experience.One of Mabinogi's strong points is the skill system, there's no skill trees, allowing players to train themselves in whatever they want with no skill prerequisites. This allows for amazing party combinations, adapting to your fellow party members weaknesses and enhancing their strengths all at the hands of players and not forced into by the game itself.The quests are all pretty good with balanced rewards, never once have I been dissapointed with a quest or felt that I wasn't rewarded appropriately.

												I've gotten past being a newcomer, even though I'm still technically a ""newbie"" due to my total level being under 1,000. But so far, I've explored many talents, but the one I like the most is a tie between ninja and medicine. Thanks to my friendly guild, awesome friends and the diverse world of Erinn, I've found Mabinogi to be worth the time and effort. The events are awesome, and my current favorite was the SAO one! Although I'm on G3, I look forward to reaching G10 and on. The stories behind the Generations is, in itself, interesting but confusing when you start G1. I'd have to say expect the unexpected, and always be ready for fun! What really makes this game fun is the guilds and the community itself. I love my guild, Mythical, and I feel completely at home with it. With that said, I recommend trying at least one talent at a time to so you can find your perfect life for Mabinogi.			"

												Mabinogi is a game where you need to be able to spend time, energy, and sadly for most gamers (ages 12-18 [generally): money. Otherwise, Mabinogi offers what is told by most game descriptions, age, unique combat, and plenty of costumes from any in-game event. Its certainly different from most MMORPG games, but if you want an easy anime life, then you'll need plenty of NX to spend. Either way, the dungeons have a decent difficulty curve, and the story is told in chapters, letting your character grow and develop on the way to the ending. The ending, however, is discovered after hundreds of quests you'll have to complete, and having friends to accompany you is very well recommended, and not just by the game. Some quests are near impossible without some comrades......and I speak from experience (damn golems.....). Mabinogi features plenty of skills to learn and master, and some of them aren't even combat related! Mabinogi is an MMO is one of those games you should play when you want to try something different, maybe even to play to meet some new friends. Either way, its your fantasy life!			"

												Nexon saw World of Warcraft, thought ""we could probably do better,"" and then spat out an anime-styled cutesy MMO for the masses to enjoy. I've been around for a good portion of it's lifespan... and through every generation as things grew bigger and I became a smaller and smaller part of the world, I sat back and enjoyed myself more and more. The choices that are there now are expansive and there's so many ways you can build your character. Don't fret, because how you build them doesn't matter! REBIRTH allows for you to start over again at level 0 if you are tired of being range-based. So you can follow your Mabinogi dreams and become a chef or a great mage or even just a fun little bard. Speaking of bards, they have a custom COMPOSING system which allows for one to fashion a song of their choosing/making. The possibilities are endless, especially if you are one for running dungeons like a classic MMO player. One drawback I can see is many parts of the game are locked/hard to get to without paying a bit of cash. Some character customizations are also premium only too, but that's mostly vanity stuff. It doesn't make it pay to win necessarily, it just makes dealing with travel and some skilling much easier, especially with a limited source of inventory slots and hotbars for skills. I still find it worthwhile to pay a little so you can play the game at it's fullest potential. The game is so expansive that I can even recount a time where I was pillowfighting with my sister in Dunbarton as our mounts went nuts trying to devour us. From what I remember, there are Humans, Giants, and Elves for racial picks, but if you buy any pets they not only carry stuff for you/between your characters more fluidly, but they also can be directly playable, so buying a flying mount can make you a taxi as well.All of that I just typed... Only a small portion of what's in store if you're up for it. Seriously, if you are into WoW, it's definitely worth checking out. Just remember that just like WoW, it's best to play with friends... 'Cept here you can go a step further and marry your friends and make them your family. Then go family dungeoning and recount endless adventures across Iria with them around a warm campfire.Mabinogi has events all the time, so it's wise to check in on it once in a time so you get LOTS of free stuff and more to pick from.I give it a 8/10. In comparison, I give a game like WoW a 6/10 due to the lack of a deep and extensive story. Mabi goes, in my opinion, too far to fill the blanks on your experience. Plus with all the events going on, odds are you'll make friends that will explain it all for you. I've had many amazing memories playing this game, and I am SURE you will too!			"

												As a person who played this game for about 4 years since the beta and then on and off again to see updates, I can honestly say that this game is not as fun as it could be. It's got blatent cash grabs all over the place. One of the biggest draws of the game is the deep character customization, but most of the costumes available are from cash only events or directly from random box items in the cash shop. The gameplay is interesting but poorly balanced. Every update brings a new flavor of the month. Anyways, I don't want to be too wordy, so here's a pro/con.Pros:Lots of character customization in looks and abilitiesA fair amount of content in the form of dungeons and missionsInteresting battle mechanicsCons:Frequently updates are just cash shop updatesLots of customization is locked behind a cash wallPoor balance in PvP (and sometimes PvE)Often exploitable bugs that trash the economy (and Nexon doesn't do the best at cleaning them up)			"

												Mabi is, in a word, unique. On various levels. This is a game where you will never have to worry about a level cap. This is a game you can play hard, or play casual and you will still enjoy it. There are probably bigger 'sandboxes' to play in, the thing about Mabi is that there is always something more you can do be doing. Typically the problem is there is too much you could actually be doing. Fun to play with friends, easy to run around solo. Like every game it has its bugs and glitches, and quirks, its jerks and amazing people all in a row. I do recommend it, however I also recommend do not give up on it on first impressions. For those coming from a more, traditional, background RPG wise, it can be a bit clunky and difficult to understand. Ask around in game, on the forums, check out the game's wiki (we all use it) and give it a few hours gameplay and a few successes before you throw in the towel and give up on the style and mechanics. If you like being a bit of everything, or wish you could play a game with complimenting skillsets (and play both or any skill set at the same time) you can here, and we welcome you to Erinn.			"

												Mabinogi is now a LEGIT FREE 2 Play MMO Game because before you had to wait 3 weeks to rebirth and gain more ap to rank your skills. Now its down to 1 week of waiting which means it gives u more time to rank your skills. So if ur like one of those people who like free roam, adventure, action MMOs try it out. It doesnt have a strict class system so you can be anything you want thats available (yes and i mean with constant updates there should be more skills coming out)			"

												I've been on this for a very long time since 2007-2008 during the year. I did feel lost for a moment, until I finally realized what I had to do. as I look at the story. It gets light but also dark twist moment at the same time. I like MMOs like this. No classes, But Talents, and Class free. Rankiing system. To me, there is no downside with this. Except Force solo. Sometimes I will have to Train Certain Skills or obtain Certain Advance Skills to get through some task that are still a pain.Still Recommand this. Just going to train hard to get through Generation 19.			"

												I've played this game on and off for almost 8 years. No, my Steam acount won't show that proof, but I refuse to play through steam, so you'll have to just take my word for it. As an overall rating, I would absolutely recommend this game to someone who is interested, however, there are always the issues of whether or not you have friends/can make them quickly. There is so much to the game that yes, you can run it solo after a lot of hard work but it doesn't feel nearly as rewarding to me without people to share it with. Sadly, this day and age, the friendly people to share it with have all but forgotten about the game. Long story short: if you don't mind soloing, it's great. If you're a social butterfly, good luck. Oh, and mind the lag & glitches, cause they rarely/never get fixed.			"

												Ive been playing this game since 2007, it's in my opinion one of the best MMORPGs ever made. I only say that because the combat is much more immersive than your standard damage battle like in WoW. The story is rich and as a free player you get a lot of benifits that used to be just for premium players. As with many FTP games there are microtransactions but you can easily play the game without spending a single dollar real money. Happy Playing.P.S. my recorded time is much less than my actual time			"

												This game is easily one of my favorites. I've not played it as long as some people, but overall I've got around (Edit) 550 hours (Including Steam & Non-Steam Hours). The game has many stories in it, even some from Shakespeare, some of my personal favorites. There's plenty of events to keep you occupied. Even if you get bored of the game, which for me, was after around 150 hours, you'll be wanting to come back to it eventually and I played it even longer after coming back to it. Story : 10/10 - Takes far longer to beat than plenty of games I've ever played and has multiple stories. Graphics : 6.5/10 - The game runs on an older engine, so graphics aren't the best, but the artwork is beautiful.  Combat : 8.5/10 - While it certainly isn't as fun as the combat in TERA (Another amazing mmorpg), the combat is better than that of many mmo's I've played. Community : 7.5/10 - The game is rather old so there's not as many players as there could be on it. Overall, the community's fun, helpful, and rather friendly. As far as being helpful goes, many experienced players are willing to help new players get a grasp on the game's key features, especially combat.  Gameplay : 9/10 - There's enough to keep you busy for a while, so there's not much to hate about it.Overall, this game was great and I plan to keep coming back to it. The game definitely deserves more attention & players than it gets. If I was to go over everything in this game, this review would be several paragraphs longer so try the game out for yourself :PEdit: The only thing I disliked about this game was it being owned by Nexon. I've typically not enjoyed games they own but this one is different and doesn't have a pay-to-win feel like other games I've played.			"

												I can not recommend this game enough, If you can't tell by the time Steam has recorded I am telling you now, and while this may not be a button-masher combat game everyone seems to expect these days I warn you that it was not supposed to be. Timing and grinding is part of the game where the storyline ranges from a small, weak character, becomes that of a god-killer. I have been reading through the other reviews claiming Pay-To-Win though Gachapons they apparently didn't know that those did not affect the player's ability to defeat the enemy A.I. or other players. Instead they affect the appearance and sometimes made the character significantly weaker so that the player can train their characters to become stronger.			"

												Please note: This is just honest opinion.  I didn't want to do this, but considering that the help was blantant half-assing, I have to do what I must.  This was also posted on the 19th, so if it says differently on the date this post was submitted, it is a lie.I enjoyed Mabinogi, it was interesting it had potential.. and I really REALLY wanted to play its UBW events for F/S, but.. sadly.. I cannot due to issues that are unknown to me and HAD consulted them directly on their site.. and...*cricket* Yeah, that.  Sadly, nothing was working, nothing was launching, and I've done all the tiers necessary to get to the bottom of this and it won't launch.  It's a free game, but the lack of players it has recently.. it is pretty self explanitory, even the community is having issues with this and not just me and yet no help to them.  Sadly.. I have to give it a thumbs down.  Like I said, I don't want to do it, but I have to out of sheer honesty.  And the worst part of it is, why are they recommending me pages to Riders of Icarus when their support page is clearly for Mabinogi?  Are they truly paying attention?  I have enjoyed their many games from the past.. but sadly, you can tell that it's not looking good for them.. especially on the tech/consumer level.  I'm sorry, Nexon.. but this is the second time you've failed me.			"

												Before it was on steam, I've played it on the regular client from the Mabinogi website. Been playing since Fall 2008 and don't regret it at all. I've made some really great friends and met many great people. I've tried quitting, but a part of me keeps dragging me back. I guess you can say Mabi has become a part of me. Anyways...if you like an anime style fantasy life then this is for you. Want a combat system unlike any other mmorpg? Mabi has it! Don't like fighting? No problem! There are lots to do without combat like commerce, fishing, cooking, tailoring, smithing and many more! Also I recommend Mari or Alexina server :)			"

												While the gamplay is unique and a breath of fresh air from all the WoW wannabes, this game has one major flaw.. and its not the game, but the company that manages it. Nexon is horrible at maintaining this game, Servers have constant lag,  and there customer service is even worse, if you have an issue with a game, only the god you worship can help you, because Nexon will never get back to you, and if they do, its going to be a canned response thats not going to help you at all,Despite what game companies claim, this game sadly isn't free to play, sure you can get started for free, but to  have any REAL fun, your going to have to sell your soul and open your wallet to get a few pets or mounts, the speed and extra storage space is MANDETORY in order get far.Regardless of the flaws in management, and the really childish graphics, Mabinogi is probably one of the best and most unique MMO's out there,  with its elements of gameplay, story quests, super powers, and no class restrictions, its a shame I have to be so negative about it. If you can round up some friends, or are social enough to make some friends in-game and got 20-30 dollars to spend, you'll be looking at an adventure that can last a year.P.S and pray to your computer that you never run into a technical problem			"

												One of the most fun MMOs I've played. The ability to switch between classes just by switching equipment. No need to put points onto your characters stats, just the skills and the stats follow. The pvp is a little lackluster with most of the time coming down to who has a better ping. The storylines are great, not perfect, but they are fun and with some having some linear correlation its fun to play through them.			"

												Warning: This game, IMO is a WoW killer! Why? Well for many reasons, some more than others. Including:1. The rebirth system: This mechanic is actually the one main factor in all of this. Once you reach the age of 20 years old (Years in this game are weeks IRL), You can rebirth your character back to Level 1. I like this because it allows you to try different playstyles. If you're smart you'll actually invest in a playstyle that you like.2. The class system: This is a trip. See, the funny thing is, You actually don't need to restrict yourself to one playstyle. The only equipment restriction you have is in terms of clothing/armor. Classes instead give you access to learning certain skills that are exclusive to that class, as well as certain buffs. For example, The Mage class allows you to have an INT boost and extra Mana. This is also true for the Generational questline.3.Life Skills: These are unique in that they require a month of two of discipline to master! The variety is in this game. For once Devs kept their promise.Overall 8.5/10			"

												Among all of the MMOs and online multiplayer games I have played over the years, Mabinogi is truly a one of a kind game. Originally debuted in 2004 as a pay 2 play and transitioned to a free 2 play in closed beta, Mabinogi started off small with only a few towns and already had a ton of features that existed today. Though my only gripe as that even though it's a free to play game, you really get the benefits of the game by paying out of the wallet. Even though people say you don't need to. Over the years Mabinogi has tried to solve this problem by elimating some premium services and letting more free 2 play features into the mix.Now compared to 2004 there is always a lot of content. People who say who say it's ""a generic MMO"" haven't really looked deep into the game's mechanics and features. It's rare you find a game where you can use your own music in battle, or find a ton of minigames like you'd find in here.Still that doesn't mean that between 2004 and now this is now flawless. I still gripe about inventory space for free 2 play players. You most likely will be forced to get a pet eventually for lack of inventory space or buy their VIP service for more bags. Also their durability feature on equips is most frustrating, especially when it's not 100% chance that you might repair an equip completely. Some times even with a high-end computer lag might hit you as well, but that's unfortunately on the server end of the game. Also some quests can be a pain to do alone.But all of those gripes don't take away from the fun of the game. I highly reccomend playing the game through it's main and side quests for at least a couple weeks and join a guild and see if you are still enjoying the game.IGN: YuenRuairi server			"

												What a game! I first played this game in NA Closed Beta back in late February 2008, and then later on and off again. Every once and a while I played, the community seemed to change as well. Mabinogi is IMO a step up from Runescape, everything is improved and also more Free-to-play. That said, lets get on with the review.TUTORIAL and START:A long time ago, every player was restricted to the human race (which has the most stable tutorials and quests). After the G4,5,6 update, players could play as elves or giants as well (tutorials were a bit flaky). The tutorials basically teach you how to play the game basically, but for more exciting gameplay you would need to learn it on your own. Now, the tutorial for gameplay consists of you clicking on a board and being taught for about 30 minutes how to play in a certain class. For Elves and Giants, there are few tutorial quests before you are sent to copy the human tutorials (Effectively making the tutorials for elves and giants pointless). TLDR: Play as a human, you'll be handsomely rewardedRACES:There are 3 races in the game: Humans, Elves, and Giants. Humans are the most balanced of all, Elves excel in archery, magic, and life skills but are terrible in melee combat, GIants excel in melee combat and alchemy, but suck in everything else. The game is heavily biased towards humans as they get the best skills, armors, and overall stats. Next up would be elves, since they excel on the skills that are most important in the game. Giants get very little, less interesting skills, very little armors, and awkward hit boxes.MAINSTREAM QUESTS AND STORY:Personally I play Mabinogi for its story, since after a while there is nothing to do in this game. It's not like people talk to each in this game (More on that later). G1-3 update introduces probably the most ""Play Me"" like story. It's about 3 ""Legendary Warriors"" and how you interact with them. It ends in a very Korean drama like way. G4-8 update focused more on the development of the game, with new races, regions, and flight mode. However it really felt like there was not really an interesting story here. G9-12 probably featured the most complete story with no loose ends, and a lot of interesting features (Shadow Missions, Demigod mode, Brionac weapon, Alchemy). G13-16 destroyed the game and ruined the reputation by essentially copying Shakespherean plays and putting Mabinogi characters into there (You know when you know something Nexon does will be bad, and it really does comes out bad). G17-18 made the quests episodic and increased the amount of ""Drama"" in them, with the return and ruined reputation of the ""3 Legendary Warriors"". G19+ has been almost a revival of the game, where it seems the developers are trying to actually make some original content for once in almost 5 years.TLDR: There are a lot of different mainstream stories. They all seem to be modeled after K-Dramas, and almost all the NPC characters' reputations end up terrible as you progress through the stories.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is incredible for when the game was released (2003 in Korea, which is 13 years ago). You can do almost anything in this game that RPGs offer, in addition to music making (The most unique feature of this game). The AI in this game used to be actually interesting with each enemy fighting in a certain pattern. As of now, all enemies just chase you and have their HP buffed to insanely high amounts. There are many different styles of fighting (Melee, Archery, Magic, Fighting, Alchemy, Gunnery, Puppetry, Ninja, Lancery). However they are not all balanced, so there are some styles of fighting clearly more advantageous than others. Crafting in the game consists of (Weaving, Tailoring, Refining, Blacksmithing, Cooking, Winemaking, Synthesizing, Metal Conversion, Magic Crafting, HIllwen Engineering, Mana Crystallization). It is really a grindfest just to participate in crafting in this game. MUSIC MAKING:The best and most unique feature of the game. You can compose music with Mabinogi Music Language and play it in the game for the community to hear. Of course every just copies their music from some where else. Some people actually put effort in the whole playing music thing in this game, where they buy a piano and play really complicated songs. For that effort, I am confused why those people would not just learn to play those songs in real life.LAST OF ALL, COMMUNITY:The most important thing about any MMORPG is its community. Mabinogi has had different groups of people play the game since I began playing it. In the beginning, a lot of players were new and there was a lot of adventuring in the game. Today, it has mostly ceased except the the Alexina server. Usually most people who are active in the game will be elitists who play with other elitists. The majority of the players in the game just AFK in Dunbarton trying to sell stuff for hours on ends. If you are a new player who wants to play this game, I heavily advise you to play on the Alexina server. Obviously this game is heavily involved with anime. That said, there are alot of weaboos present in the game (YOU have been warned). Also, ""Fashionogi"". Everybody invested in this game seems to have millions of pets filled with endless amounts of clothes to prance around in.RECOMMENDATION:Taking all these into account, I do recommend playing this game for at least a few hours to see what it offers. Today this game probably can not compare to other games, due to its aging graphics, maintenance, and dying community. A lot of players I have met over the 8 years I played this game have moved on to newer games. Mabinogi will forever be one of the greatest games I played (probably due to the time I played it, when everything was still new). That said, I probably would hate this game if I played it for the first time today. Because of all the new content, I have been slowly distancing myself from this game. It won't be very long until I myself completely quit the game.If you are looking for a more action based game with similar backgrounds, try Vindictus. It's the prequel of this game, but a lot entertaining to action based players with short attention spans.			"

												Edit: A more serious review of this game is that it is a fantastically bland looking generic game that has a wealth of depth in what you can pull off and put your time into for the game.I've never experienced a game that made me feel like I could do as much as I could playing this and nowadays despite the age of the game getting to itself if you can look past the janky buggy movement and gameplay you'll see the charm it holds.A more serious note on progression of this game is that it is surprisingly not that Pay2Win formula other reviews tend to give you a whole plethora of new player friendly content is out to ease the transition and the most you would ever feel encouraged to spend on is a mount or a pet for extra storage. The one argument that can made is that all the tools to make oneself into a stronger and steamrolling character exist but to feasibly pull this off would require hundreds if not more of real life money to pull off.If you ever plan on making it far in this game please be aware that the game treats skills and advancing as a slow more methodical approach with being consistent about your intentions to raise and level which can turn some people off if they're too used to MMO's since progression is more usually linked to gear/level progression.

												In the past, it was a great game that pushed for community.  As it grew, it became more and more solo focused.  The combat system was designed to be slow paced.  Would definitely recommend this game for those who enjoy developing their characters into a one-man killing machine.  Or those who just love fashion, or looking cute, or love to afk in towns.Recommendations for in-game:- Number 1 thing to do is: Visit the wiki, get an idea of which path you would want to start with.- Start by focusing on your life skills.  They will improve your combat abilities through passive means.- Rank each skill up one by one so that you can achieve Rank 1 in each.- Take advantage of your newbie status by resetting your Rank 1 skills so that you have more AP to rank another skill. (Recommended since you will be free to rank your skill back to 1 without training again)- Talk casually with people, ask and let them lord over you as if you need shelter from an invisible enemy. (There are good people who are understanding and make recommendations for skill paths or training methods, others will try to shove their methods down your throat)The Good (presently):- Game is largely solo-able since a large part of the community seems consist of isolated groups.- Story line is ok if you don't care how they butcher some mythological characters.- Combat is unique, inbetween fast and slow pace.  Used to run on a Rock-Paper-Scissors sort.- Life skills are extremely tedious, but is also the most rewarding.- Large variety of pets.- Huge map filled with life.The Bad (presently):- Community seems to be extremely immature and isolated.  Many are obessessed with PvP.- Skills are in no-way balanced for PvP while patches try improve the PvP scene.- Heavy on the Pay-to-win scale.  Pets are now stacked with beneficial buffs or attacks when summoned. (almost game breaking)- Group are hard to find for dungeons or challenges for new players.  Not many are willing to have a character that isn't stacked in their groups.- Latest Patches have made their gorgeous map into nothing worth exploring (very little reason to head out there and kill mobs)			"

												Something I've been playing since just after the beta, even after nearly 10 years i still find it a good game but nexon as a company is negligent to issues and repeats cheap events rather than fix problems that could revive this games playerbase. i myself love the combat, the fact your forced react to players is exciting, because any player can defeat anyone else if they can manage to outplay them, i have prooved this before with a new character agaisnt someone whos level was nearing 2k, so this is a game where the quote"" anything is possible"" is a valid argument.

												This game is fabulous and bad at the same time. If there was a neutral button toward a review, this would be the one game I'd use it on. Here are some pro's & con's.Con's first, cause' it will grab your attention at the very finest.PS: , I mention this later but, I have around 2500 hours on this game and I've played for four years. Don't take my hours on the steam platform for granted please :)Cons:*BAD support, as far as I know, only half the people in their customer/tech support system actually do their job.*Money-hungry company, this game is 'considered' a pay to win due to the mere impossibility of doing things without money near-end game, but it's still a great experience otherwise.*Not much customization, in outfits, near early-game, which is rather considerably okay how they deal with it. Not really a con.//Some of these con's deal with the company that franchises it, the gameplay is, heavily, HEAVILY, different.Pros:*Epic combinations of skills that will leave you on your seat when you happen to get that unexpected boss kill ;D*Best community out there for a [mainly] free2play game.*Grand amounts of customization near mid-game, leading to epic skill combos, neat outfits, tools..*DUAL WIELDING, do I HAVE to explain this? They handle it so well.*It doesn't feel like a grind in the beginning or middle, near late game is where grindy stuff happens.*Memorable times...!*A VARIETY of amazing skills such as fishing, making a campfire, cooking even! These were added to make the game more realistic and overall bondworthy toward. It also makes some killer picnic's.*Realistic-like PVP , or, in this case, Duels. You literally walk up to someone, ask them if they want to duel. A menu comes up, you set the pre-requisites straight forward and get dueling. You aren't FORCED to do it either, and you can make good friends off of it.*Graphics are easy to render, a lower-end / mid-end computer could easily run 30-100FPS. The game was made around 2000-something if I recall. The graphics still look amazing though.//*Death penalty system is not degradeful, hated, or anything in particular. It is annoying when you die, you get Nao stones to revive on full health sometimes though, and even if you do die, you don't lose anything. There is a chance when you die you may lose your gear if its expensive and not blessed by a certain item, but you can get it back at a town hall for a .. 'reasonable yet sometimes a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ kind of price.//*And finally, its NOT a rage game. Well, not easily alas. Sometimes there are mobs that can truly p1ss off someone but other than that, you don't lose very much.//\\Oh and, don't take my hours for granted. This game was just recently platformed on steam, it used to be on the companies website, which doesn't, as you may know, transfer hours over to here.I've played Mabinogi for four years! Highly inactive, but I at least have 2500 hours on the game and I've witnessed all the stuff they've done on it.//\\This is a more TL:DR Version::!!//\\There are plenty more cons to the game, but they are outweighed heavily by the amount of pros this game contains. The community is so well knitted together that even a child could have fun without any pervs or foul language to watch out for. It's fun, engaging, and most of all, it's made for a community. You can manage epic combos in combat, you can even have pets. Its pretty cool, and is definitely worth trying.However, the support service/s are typically bad, but you can still manage a refund if you didn't get something you payed for. They are money hungry , as they support many different games imported from Japan, and I can understand that. When they ask for too much money though, its pretty noticable. Back on the topic of the game though, there isn't much customization in the beginning, so its kind of boring. If you keep on going though, you'll find it pretty epic overall.--//...An even more TL;DR version..!! ;//\\Fun / Engaging game; but has a bad support service / company. It is a near pay to win at the end, but it is still very fun. It's also very involved with the community, most people are friendly and you don't have to watch out for swear-a-holics. A 9 year old could play this and learn to be kind from the community, most of the time.//OVERALL SCORE, the moment you've been waiting for..I give this game an 8.5 / 10  !!The reason I knocked off 1.5 points was rather simple, just the bad service and company it is owned by in America and the 'noticable yet not overkill' hunger for money they desire to keep the game rolling. Here is a more in-depth explanation.+1 - Great graphic design, even for a game made near 2000. It can also handle lower-end computers well.+3 - Epic community for a free-to-play game, it is very well knitted together, its hard to rip apart. Very hard.+4.5 - Amazing combat system, PVP, and gameplay in general. Has a killer storyline too.-1.5 - Aside from all that, the game has a bad support system and is a mere pay to win near the end. You can still have a great time though.Thanks for reading through this, I hope I've told you the most I could about this fabulous game.-~Kon			"

												    Community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ now most guilds require rediculously high total levels with two alternatives which happen to be new guilds (which usually die given a few weeks) or guilds with so much drama involved you'll be wanting to leave in a matter of hours. The skill systems suck now. When I first started playing mabinogi years ago the skill system was perfect the enemy AI was actually intelligent and made the game difficult which was FANTASTIC. With the addition and revamping of so many skills and now getting AP for talents it makes the game hilariously easy.   Sure hope you like spending money! Because if you like to save your money, back the ♥♥♥♥ away now! This game is pay to win and I should know as I've spent more than my fair share of money on this bucket of crap. Pets are basically useless now. Before it was difficult to beat the game without some kind of pet because the difficulty curve actually existed. Now Nexon is coming out with pets worth $12 that ♥♥♥♥ing SING ALONG WITH YOU.   Sure hope you don't like customer service when it comes to nexon. One of my accounts was banned years back for no particular reason and I sent a ticket in and I never heard a damn thing about why my account was banned. So within a span of about 3-4 years I sent in a total number of 15 tickets and NONE of them had even been touched by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutomer ""service"" representatives. There are also absolutely NO refunds here. Trust me I did try to get my money back from wasting at least $200 on my at the time recently banned account.  The events are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and are recycled every year. You're lucky if you happen to see an event from a few years back and that's what they say is ""New and shiny events"" more like trash that they shined up for you so they could stick it up your♥♥♥♥♥easier. On occasion they'll add a new event but generally it's so boring you'll wish there were no events. Mabinogi makes it now so that there is ALWAYS an event but it just...It just doesn't work.All in all the game just isn't all that fun anymore. I certainly would not recommend it anymore.			"

The combat is cool, but somewhat difficult to get a hang of. However, I do enjoy the atmosphere and and feel of living life in a fantasy world. This game, through the facade of anime-like characters and charm, has helped me overcome some of my real world inhibitions. A great game, if not: a great experience.			"

												I have played mabi from the first generation and on and off for every year, sometimes doing speed runs on different characters. It's not the same as the older versions but it's still good. The client is low spec so you can multitask while playing and the gameplay is reactive and somewhat player skill based early on but at higher levels it might not be as fun. The best part of this mmo is the character customization. In the past I delete all my characters to start over with all the  customization features for free, but I don't know if that works anymore. It's a good mmo to create a character you like and play with.			"

												I enjoy it, but the populace is rather small, and people don't talk much which is a problem since some skills and quest require you to have a party. The difficulty in learning skills is also higher for some skills than others, but whatt i enjoy is that there is much more to do. Many mmo's I've played have been nothing more than kill and fetch quest with little story, but luckily mabi has more to it and actually presents its story rather then just t having it in a fetch quest where it's not even necessary to read.

												Very fun plot line to play through and very addicting game ... though in the end game there is barely anything besides repeating commernceing, replaying the Saga plot lines and PvP. .... Well the "" open PVP "" system of paladin vs Dark Knight and Elf vs gaint is very broken meaning you die once and you basicly lose conintuously until you get to a healer's house to heal up but also you hit at 100% power to the other person thus you are doing hundreds if not throsands of dmg per hit and the max HP is only 1500 w/o trans anyways which only will bring it up as much as 1850 hp but stil that is a 4 hit kill and you revive with 5hp and the rest of it wound that cannot be restored with a normal HP potion. This is how that kind of PVP is broken. PVP via the Dualing system is better and what most ppl on Mabinogi use now as it lasts longer you do ussualy 1s but i ahve seen it go up to like 12 dmg some times when on 0% though good question how they got to 12 dmg when it should have been all 1 dmg hits. The plot is getting longer still and that is good and they are still tweaking it so the older skills are not always worse than the newer ones which i  also see as a good thing			"

												I love this game and it is fantastic to play especially with other people.   While the video slightly over embelishes all of the things simply because not that many people are that focused in the game unless there is an event, it is completely possible to do all the things and is a game that brings me back to it every single time.  Definitely give it a chance and begin your fantasy life in Mabinogi.			"

												It's a good, casual game. Not for heavy upgraders and character maxers. It takes a long time to get up in levels, months, years, just to get where you want. It is fun, though, with so many options. You'll never really run out of things to do. It's more like you get tired of not having enough people around to do all that you can do.The first Saga is a must to finish, for the free pet. You get free pets, but each character can get a free pet from the saga, and the inventory is worth it. Always make your characters on the same server. Get a human first for free giant and human cards. And to anyone who says money is hard to get, it really isn't. Do events, sell your potions, and get a gold talent for hard-mode missions (with some strong people to drag you through it, and pick up all the gold they leave).			"

												Mabinogi is one of my favourite MMORPGs. With its good storyline, unique artsyle and combat system, it is a great game to play.   It was the first MMORPG that I really got stuck into and enjoyed a lot. You can be anything, do anything with not many restrictions on class/skill leveling. I have had some lag in the past, but that's only because I'm playing a game hosted in NA while I live in Australia. I only stopped playing due to no one else playing with me... :< Mabinogi is the game that I benchmark MMORPGs on. I'm literally doing a Shakespeare subject thanks to this game as well...  xDP.S.

												This game is really good and addicting, however, it's player base is dying due to how old the game is and people who dump gold thus rising the price of items in the market.

												This is honestly a pretty decent mmo. It might not have the best graphics but it's still pretty fun. There a few classes you can pick from and you can switch whenever. I think a problem though is that the game doesn't force you to play the story in order, as such you can skip right to the end of the story if you know how. This isn't ideal though as enemies will be able to kill you quickly. Regardless if you have friends, or simply want to make friends, then this game might be worth a try. Hop in a random guild and hope for the best.			"

												Personal review 9.5/10Objective review 5/10I love this game. I played this game since it was beta and this is game that literally grew up with me. Whenever I play this game I have nostalgic feeling of me playing this game when I was elemantary student. Some people say WoW is game that people can never quit, but keeps on coming back, but for me this is a game that I will never ever quit (unless it closed down) and will probably be my first and last MMORPG.Reason I like this game so much is you have so much things to do. You can play this game socially by joining guilds. You can play this game going through quests. You can play this game playing music within game with different kinds of instruments. You can play this game doing all kinds of things such as trading/farming and so on. Even though graphic may somewhat look outdated, it kinda shows how old this game is.However, I also find it disturbing how this game changed so much to pay to win. While this game is free to play and therefore you dont have to pay any money, in reality, you kinda do if you want to take some part in the game. For beginners this game can be really hard because if you start this game literally from the blank, you will have tough time going through anything. Even though there are many features u can enjoy, you need funds. So overall do I recommend this game? Yes I do. Even though this game has gotten somewhat pay to win game, regardless it is great game and there are so many things you can to enjoy this game. If you are tired of WoW type MMO which just repeats quest - raid - pvp cycle, I definitely recommend this game. I wish future MMO adapts Mabinogi.			"

												Mabinoji is overall a well polished game. The graphics and theme are appealing and I found this game very fun to play. However, I have always had a problem with it's quests. Sometimes, they tell you to return a quest to an NPC, and they don't tell you where the heck that NPC is. I am sometimes really frustrated by this. Also, this is not a game that you can play solo. The dungeon's difficulty increases exponentially. The first maybe two dungeons you could do on your own, but anything after is nearly impossible without a party. Also the inventory idea in this game is terrible. You have like 100 inventory space in your bag. Tht doesn't sound too bad right? Think again. The Items aren't limited to one inventory space, so I often have to throw things away just to get my reward for my quest. This feature does make the game more realistic, but it makes the game feel less and less fun. The storyline is pretty good, but it is hard to follow, because you have to complete a dungeon to get to the next storypoint. And as I mentioned earlier, you just can't solo it. This game does have many problems, but I would definitely recommend playing it.			"

												Definitely one of the best MMO experiences I've had. Mabinogi allowed me the freedom to♥♥♥♥♥♥around, to explore and discover things on my own. It won't hold your hand a ton but that's not to say it's brutally difficult. You really just do find your own way in its world.I had to leave it behind cold-turkey because I got addicted for nearly a month straight. It was just so cool to do trade runs, gather materials for crafting, attempt and often fail dungeons because I suck at combat... if I recall correctly the last thing I was doing was collecting creatures so that I could transform into them.I met a lot of interesting folks. One player posed as a dog and just barked and followed me around for a day. He helped a friend and I complete a tough dungeon and generally made that day's experience a ton of fun.The game is a bit antiquated in some respects but I was easily able to look past that and have a good time.Give it a fair try, maybe with a couple of friends, or make a couple of new ones in there. Or go solo if that's what you really want to do, maybe take pictures and do a blog about your journey.Just settle on down and play yourself some Mabinogi, bro. Enjoy it.			"

												First off, if you're into anime/manga-- great! Mabinogi will probably appeal to you with its chibi-esque appearance/graphics. The game has multiple facets (all not included here): you can dungeons, farm, do daily jobs from various NPCs in town, romance players with your music playing abilities. Your character can age, lose/gain weight... and you can even ""reset"" by choosing the ""rebirth"" option. Dungeons can be solo'd or done in groups: all set up in a labyrinth-esque scheme.All in all a good game, but it gets a bit repetitive/boring after a while. If you're looking to kill time, check it out: but other than that, Mabinogi doesn't have enough substance in my opinion. The added fact that there is a cash shop available for players that want to get ahead or customize their characters further doesn't help either.			"

There is strategy to the rock, paper, scissors playstyle that allows the player to never get tired of battle.  It's not a spam mechanic which is great!

												Mabinogi is a very open ended MMORPG with multiple main quests to play, lots of dungeons and events, lots of weapons and cool swag to snag, and lots of NX goodies... which thankfully isn't as required with the new updates. It's F2P, more so than ever these days actually. The game still suffers from lag, but it always has suffered from it. I blame the largeness of the game and the Fergus maintaned servers that are probably older to begin with. The game has customization that was almost unheard of at the time of it's creation (which is what really drew me in), and it still is pretty massive in terms of how unique you can make and build yourself.Lastly, an absolute blast with friends. It can get a bit boring and tedious alone, but find a few friends who play in real life, or find some friendly faces in the game, and you are in for a great time.Original circa 2012: This has got to be the best MMORPG I've ever played, sooo much fun with friends! There's so much to do, find, level, earn, many paths to go, etc!			"

												Warning: This game, IMO is a WoW killer! Why? Well for many reasons, some more than others. Including:1. The rebirth system: This mechanic is actually the one main factor in all of this. Once you reach the age of 20 years old (Years in this game are weeks IRL), You can rebirth your character back to Level 1. I like this because it allows you to try different playstyles. If you're smart you'll actually invest in a playstyle that you like.2. The class system: This is a trip. See, the funny thing is, You actually don't need to restrict yourself to one playstyle. The only equipment restriction you have is in terms of clothing/armor. Classes instead give you access to learning certain skills that are exclusive to that class, as well as certain buffs. For example, The Mage class allows you to have an INT boost and extra Mana. This is also true for the Generational questline.3.Life Skills: These are unique in that they require a month of two of discipline to master! The variety is in this game. For once Devs kept their promise.Overall 8.5/10			"

												I've never found a game that can compare to this one. I've tried for many years to find a game that exceeds my rating than this one but i haven't. You can literally do anything. Farming, PvPing, Quests, etc. Basically I find this game to be the closest to SAO without the virtual reality. You can get so addicted to this game. I recommend it. If you ever get on, get on Tarlach & add me! Camxuyen or Catasuki :)			"

												Okay, so. Having heard about this game, and seeing the mostly positive reviews, I decided to attempt to play it. However, once I managed to navigate the start up menu and create a character (and even that was a chore), I was just plopped in the world, with very little explination of what to do, no money and no weapon. I proceeded to wander around aimlessly until I got killed by a giant spider because I didn't know how to attack. Eventually, I managed to get a slim understanding of what I had to do. However, even so, the controls were so horrendus that I had a very hard time enjoying this game. In conclusion:Pros:-Amazing premise-Cute characters-Good storytelling-Player choiceCons:-Terrible controls-Hard to play-No guidance-The usual 'free-to-play-except-if-you-want-to-suceed-you-need-to-buy-things'			"

												When one first enters into Mabinogi, it will seem like a simple MMORPG.But it's not, it's like calling TF2 a simple FPS.What makes this game unique is how it gives so many approaches and how immersive it is.You can be a chef that smashes things with a hammer, or a puppeteer who fights by controlling puppets twice your size. And unlike most MMORPGs which take to grinding to make any money or levels, Mabinogi uses an intriguing and original way to avoid this droning method of advancement.While there is indeed content that requires real money that adds on to the experience. Playing it free by itself is still worthwhile and satiating for the gaming palette, especially if you enjoy immersion.			"

												I've only just started playing this game but thus far I really like it. A lot of the people playing are pretty friendly as long as you aren't rude and the game is pretty easy to figure out when you get in. The first thing I would want to say though is that going into this I did make 2 characters, one of them was used for learning to play the game, and the other was used to play once I figured the game out. idk if this was a good Idea but I feel like with the first character I was able to make all the mistakes I needed to make while learning and not worry about it affecting the rest of my gameplay experience.That being said it didn't take me long to figure the game out and if you're used to most basic MMO style gameplay then you should be able to figure out a lot of the concepts and UI placement pretty quickly. When I started I played as a basic human warrior and I have to say that I had a lot of fun with the combat. The fighting style with close combat is very fun and it feels like when you're hitting things you're actually doing something. The second talent I tried was magic because I thought it might be kinda fun to use magic at a distance and then beat my enemies down with my sword when they got close. I do have to say that to me personally I didn't think that the magic felt very rewarding to me. It seemed like I was just kinda poking things and making them angry and I found myself using my swords a lot more often.Another thing I noticed that I actually really liked is that you can go anywhere. If you want to wander into an area with mobs that are much stronger than you, the game won't tell you that you can't. I mean you will obviously get murdered going in there but I feel like it makes the game more fun when exploring because you don't know how powerful a mob is compared to you in a new area until you attack it. The sense of exploration and not knowing if you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you the second you attack something makes the game a lot more fun for me personally.Again this is all low level beginner experiences of mine and the gameplay could become much better as you become higher level. I feel that this game is probably going to become kind of an addiction for me but this is also the first 2 weeks of me playing this game. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys MMO style games and loves exploration in games.			"

But due to my wife creating a account through my steam account, I was unable to create my own account and character due to the annoying secondary pin number. We have many F2P games on my steam account and all of them gives us the choice to create multiple accounts but this one. So based off that I am unable to rate this game. I'm sure its a great game for people who need one account but the trouble you have to go through to have multiple accounts is not worth my time.  "

												I'm sure for those that it works for, this game is a lot of fun. It looks really neat and I love the idea of being able to choose between being an adventurer, or just chilling and going for a more relaxed alternative like becoming a chef or a tailor, or a farmer and fisherman/woman. Unfortunately, the game keeps freezing for me repeatedly no matter what. After creating my character, it froze while loading me into the world to begin. I couldn't find any way to close out of the game, as nothing on my keyboard worked. So I was forced to shut down my computer just so I could close the game. Still hoping it would work, I tried loading it up a second time and I thought it was fine. I could move around, perform actions (Like laughing, greeting, dancing, disapproving ect) but I heard no background music. So I found the Menu button and tried to hit Options, hoping I could turn the music on and maybe figure out what I ought to be doing. Unfortunately, when I hit Options, my game froze once more and I could find no means of escaping. F1-12 buttons didn't work, neither did the Fn keys, and not even the ever reliable Escape key let me get out of the game. I am not sure if its because this particular mmorpg is popular, and therefore it has terrible and severe lag....or my laptop just can't handle it. Which I would sincerely doubt, as I have Windows 10 on my laptop, and it's a Lenovo ideapad Y700.It's really a shame I couldn't get the game to work, it looked like it would be a lot of fun and I was really looking forward to the idea of creating my own homestead.

												I really do like this game, it's absolutely fun to play and pass the time on, whether I'm doing something or just hanging out with other players online. There's tons of things to do, the way this game is played is incredible, I can't even begin to explain how many customizations there are to making your character suited just for you.The community is great, often there will be people who aren't so friendly, but it's overall a great game. There are some issues with it though, a lot of players feel the same about it. The frustration of bugs and crashing issues, errors, or just mabinogi suddenly not being installed is a hassle. Nexon need to keep on top of these things. The game would have a lot more potential if they'd keep tabs on crash issues and bugs. I don't really expect a superior mmorpg on this game, but it would be more enjoyable if they'd have their software up to date with technology today.			"

												Mabinogi, A fun filled online MMO RPG game. A completly free to play and not a pay to win game! I started back in 2012 I think it was, when transformation first came out as long as the cheetah pet, so I have a pretty vast knowledge about the game. It's a difficult game to get into at first because it's a old fashioned MMO and is a slow pace game. You have to be ready to spend major time into this game, and be committed if you want to get good at it. I have shown this game to a major amount of my friends, and 75% quit the game straight up because it is a diffcult game to understand when you first start. I personally love challanges, so for me this is quite what i was looking for. I would give a hands down to all the benifits they added to new players, it makes the game 100 times easier and with the new rebirth for free untill level 1000, it makes the game more easier and faster to finish (less waiting time).ALSO NOOBS GET TWO FREE MOUNTS! Games never do that... Nexon seems to be keeping the game fresh with ideas and new events every few weeks are so, so the game never gets boring. The community is very sweet and easy to co-op with as well and there are many friendly people. Mabinogi has many multiplayer cabillity so it is very fun to play with your peers. The game is very unique and I never played anything like it. It has a large range of things you can change on your character (face, hair, outfits) so you can personlize yourself how ever you want. The game is also completely free to play, and you can beat it without having memberships. (ex. World of Warcraft) The downside is you have to pay to get unique mounts, but they now added to where new players can get a horse and eagle mount for free. The combat system is very different, and basicly have to use the keyboard to preform skills, kind of like League in a way. Many talents/classes are avalible to choose from, and you never have to stay with just one, you can switch constantly. So the expierence never gets old. A new talent/class comes usually bout every year or so. Anyways to sum this all up, I recommend anyone who is up for a challenge and up for a wonderful expierence to play this game. And I wish you the best of luck to becoming a Grandmaster. Final rating: 10/10			"

												I have currently put around 70 hours into this game (the most hours i have put into a steam game) and i find this game very enjoyable, as it really is the first mmorpg that i have decided to play for more than three days. This game has more to it than your typical rpg, with just the mainstream classes like mage, archer, and warrior (it has these classes as well), but has different classes such as bard, puppeteer, battle alchemist, and more fun classes. In this game ""Classes"" are known as talents, you choose a talent and you get more exp in that ""class"". This does not mean that you cannot master other skills, you just get more exp. There are different types of talents, such as Life talents which are like talents you practice outside of dungeoneering and monster slaying. Examples of these are: cook, Tailor, smithing, and music. That is all i have to say, i really recommend this game.			"

Since then ive had fun with it, however ive raged and laughed like with any other game. Its a bit challenging when you start out but once you figure out how to do the basic jobs it becomse easy, It can be a basic dungeon raider if you want it to be or you can do creative other things, like refine music talent, be a merchant, even cook food, ive tried many of the talents and so far for me ive stuck to a merc, its good money and its nice to help others out. however the combat system can be a bit on the down side sometimes, but with any game be paitent with it.

												Significantly active international community considering it's a Korean anime MMORPG.  Enjoyable game, though dungeon/fighting system can get a bit stale, the diverse skill system makes up for it. Constant bugs and crashes tend to have a significant impact though, even though I have great internet connection and a fairly recent laptop (2 years old). Closest game one would get to Sword Art Online to date. Gaming (like most if not all MMORPGs) is multiple times better with other players so get socializing!

I only say that because the combat is much more immersive than your standard damage battle like in WoW. The story is rich and as a free player you get a lot of benifits that used to be just for premium players. As with many FTP games there are microtransactions but you can easily play the game without spending a single dollar real money.

												I thought the concept of doing whatever I wanted was cute. I got the game, downloaded/installed it, and proceeded to play the game. I was entertained for a little while, the combat system irks me a little because it was unfamiliar but I gave it my best shot. After playing this game for a bit, the process of LOGGING OFF is a nightmare. I played this game TWICE and it crashed my entire system TWICE. I was forced to use the power button to shutdown my system because the Task Manager could not even close the program and crash. I had all the specs required to play this game...and I cannot log off normally. That is why I gave a ""Thumbs Down""...a Thumbs up on the idea, if it doesn't effect your system.			"

But its dated, and needs a whole new backend and client.Yes I Clicked YES to reccomend... why, because of the hundreds of hours Ive spent on this game.. [far before it landed in steam] Ive had honest fun with it.

												It really is a fantastic game, Ive played it since 08 and since a lot of my favorite mmos over the year shut down, I find it to have aged well with the years. Its an old mmo that holds its own even in the field of newer mmos emerging.It has a lot of features that are standard in some MMOs today, though it was made far before then.Do I reccomend this game, absolutely, but I wouldnt try to be a completionist, you will only ruin your own experience if you rush through content to max everything as fast as possible.

												Overall id have to give it some credit granted the community has shrunk but ive been playing this game for a few years now. Since then ive had fun with it, however ive raged and laughed like with any other game. Its a bit challenging when you start out but once you figure out how to do the basic jobs it becomse easy, It can be a basic dungeon raider if you want it to be or you can do creative other things, like refine music talent, be a merchant, even cook food, ive tried many of the talents and so far for me ive stuck to a merc, its good money and its nice to help others out. however the combat system can be a bit on the down side sometimes, but with any game be paitent with it.

												Mabinogi is a different type of MMORPG that allows you to be good in multiple ""Talents"" (Talents are pretty much classes). The talent system allows you to be a Mage-Ninja-Chef that can dual wield guns; it really allows for you to be anything you want, and there are other aspects of the game that don't have their own talent like fashion (Tons of outfits). The social aspect of the game is what kept me on most of the time. It's just amazing meeting some overall nice people. The PvP in Mabinogi is broken at the moment in my opinion. PvP is 30% Skill, 20% total level, and 50% Equipment(PAY TO WIN). The current state of the game is laggy at times for my high-end computer, a decently low amount but just enough to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off bugs, and low in players on all servers except Alexina. I would totally recommend this game to people who are into MMORPGS and some that are just into RPGS since I've found myself going through quite a bit of MMORPGS before I played Eve Online for years and then came to Mabinogi. I've been spoiled by the amount of freedom that Mabinogi has that I couldn't even get into Black Desert. It does not make Mabinogi a better game than Black Desert but the freedom aspect is just very appealing to me. There is an Ingame market that allows players to trade almost all items for gold or exchange directly between players.----------------------------------------------------Pros+FreedomStoryCommunityCustomization----------------------------------------------------Middle Ground+-Anime style elementsPvEMarket----------------------------------------------------Cons-lagbugsPvP (Pay-to-Win)Graphics----------------------------------------------------If you join Mabinogi feel free to send me a note (IGN: Kavah | Server: Alexina) "

												This game is easily one of my favorites. I've not played it as long as some people, but overall I've got around (Edit) 550 hours (Including Steam & Non-Steam Hours). The game has many stories in it, even some from Shakespeare, some of my personal favorites. There's plenty of events to keep you occupied. Even if you get bored of the game, which for me, was after around 150 hours, you'll be wanting to come back to it eventually and I played it even longer after coming back to it. Story : 10/10 - Takes far longer to beat than plenty of games I've ever played and has multiple stories. Graphics : 6.5/10 - The game runs on an older engine, so graphics aren't the best, but the artwork is beautiful.  Combat : 8.5/10 - While it certainly isn't as fun as the combat in TERA (Another amazing mmorpg), the combat is better than that of many mmo's I've played. Community : 7.5/10 - The game is rather old so there's not as many players as there could be on it. Overall, the community's fun, helpful, and rather friendly. As far as being helpful goes, many experienced players are willing to help new players get a grasp on the game's key features, especially combat.  Gameplay : 9/10 - There's enough to keep you busy for a while, so there's not much to hate about it.Overall, this game was great and I plan to keep coming back to it. The game definitely deserves more attention & players than it gets. If I was to go over everything in this game, this review would be several paragraphs longer so try the game out for yourself :PEdit: The only thing I disliked about this game was it being owned by Nexon. I've typically not enjoyed games they own but this one is different and doesn't have a pay-to-win feel like other games I've played.			"

												I can not recommend this game enough, If you can't tell by the time Steam has recorded I am telling you now, and while this may not be a button-masher combat game everyone seems to expect these days I warn you that it was not supposed to be. Timing and grinding is part of the game where the storyline ranges from a small, weak character, becomes that of a god-killer. I have been reading through the other reviews claiming Pay-To-Win though Gachapons they apparently didn't know that those did not affect the player's ability to defeat the enemy A.I. or other players. Instead they affect the appearance and sometimes made the character significantly weaker so that the player can train their characters to become stronger.			"

												Ok they have reworked this game several times but tbh this game is only worth if u have others to play with or alot of free time and dont mind spending it grinding ur asz off the reason i say this is because endgame is almost impossible without gold grinding to maintain equipments and upgrade them while this cost no cash it does get boring also if playing from the east coast expect to lag alot i never quite figured out how to fix it even after trying a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fixes found on the wiki or from other players tbh i would prolly still play if the lag wasnt so terrible.i hate that the only way to really get a stonger char is to become a crafter for stats but the reason this game still exist is because its a true gem nexon isnt perfect but they seem to care about the game and there is no other mmo with mabinogi's no class skill based system that i can find.god i love this game but the lag just isnt worth it for me but if u dont live east coast give it a shot			"

A lot of stuff is in there and because it's Free to Play, there are microtransactions in the form of various prepaid currencies. Most of it is vanity-related stuff, though. So nothing to get too angry about.I have a bit of a bias towards the game because I've known about it for so long and played it for a good number of years. I'm also a smelly weeaboo who enjoys this type of thing mostly because of the art style and lovable characters. So take that as you will.7/10			"

												A little about this game, for an MMORPG it has a lot of hidden little secrets like gifting to the npcs to get special items to be sold, no factions but still has some pvp. Farming (like actual fruits and crops) to make money but takes time and igc. Armor doesnt mean as much as skill playing (cant just blindly attack, you need to time it for good combos with melee)...the best way to describe it is that it is like a friendly dark souls...but be careful if you die without getting all your gear in holy water, then it may disapear and you need to go get it from ""repo"". all in all a person can kill a bear bare handed at level 1 at the age of 6 and get a couple of special titles.30/10 would rematch bear over and over again.

												I'd say this game has lived quite past its glorious day, but most of its features can be interesting.Firsthand, the crafting system feels a bit more involved, for you actually have to toss-in inputs in order to gain improved results, which is quite an interesting twist on the standard MMORPG's way of rolling with that.The combat system feels a bit awkward at first, but that issue will eventually disappear with time.The main issue I can perceive so far is related to the low server population, but it is quite normal at this advanced stage of existence.Lastly, if you enjoy life skills and some creative class design, this game has plenty of them to entertain you for quite a while.

												If you're looking for a fantasy life game that isn't the sims, play this first. This game is really fun with friends. Get friends, play with them. I've been playing on and off since I was about 10 or 11. I am now 16, still fun but the game has changed more than I would have liked it to. The social aspect is really awesome, the game isn't really suit for pvp unless you're dueling or have your trans pvp activated. One of the only things I don't like about it now is how it seems that it is beginning to die out of players, Alexina still says ""new server"" even though it came out before I even started playing, Nexon made it incredibly easier for new players to get a hold of the game if they're under level 1k (now new people wont know the struggle of having to wait for weeks just to rebirth). Other than the nostalgia of being a kid that it gives me, I have to say it is indeed one of the best MMO games I've ever played since it hits the dot when it says ""fantasy life.""			"

												In the past, it was a great game that pushed for community.  As it grew, it became more and more solo focused.  The combat system was designed to be slow paced.  Would definitely recommend this game for those who enjoy developing their characters into a one-man killing machine.  Or those who just love fashion, or looking cute, or love to afk in towns.Recommendations for in-game:- Number 1 thing to do is: Visit the wiki, get an idea of which path you would want to start with.- Start by focusing on your life skills.  They will improve your combat abilities through passive means.- Rank each skill up one by one so that you can achieve Rank 1 in each.- Take advantage of your newbie status by resetting your Rank 1 skills so that you have more AP to rank another skill. (Recommended since you will be free to rank your skill back to 1 without training again)- Talk casually with people, ask and let them lord over you as if you need shelter from an invisible enemy. (There are good people who are understanding and make recommendations for skill paths or training methods, others will try to shove their methods down your throat)The Good (presently):- Game is largely solo-able since a large part of the community seems consist of isolated groups.- Story line is ok if you don't care how they butcher some mythological characters.- Combat is unique, inbetween fast and slow pace.  Used to run on a Rock-Paper-Scissors sort.- Life skills are extremely tedious, but is also the most rewarding.- Large variety of pets.- Huge map filled with life.The Bad (presently):- Community seems to be extremely immature and isolated.  Many are obessessed with PvP.- Skills are in no-way balanced for PvP while patches try improve the PvP scene.- Heavy on the Pay-to-win scale.  Pets are now stacked with beneficial buffs or attacks when summoned. (almost game breaking)- Group are hard to find for dungeons or challenges for new players.  Not many are willing to have a character that isn't stacked in their groups.- Latest Patches have made their gorgeous map into nothing worth exploring (very little reason to head out there and kill mobs)			"

												EDIT 2: This game is quite interesting to the fact that you can learn other skills and talents by using the item associated with the action/talent. For example:I use a bow ""You have gained knowledge about the Archery Skill!"" I read a book on magic,""You have gained knowledge about the Lightning Bolt Skill""! I don't have too terribly much expierience with MMORPGs,but I still think this feature is great. Being able to become a Martial Arts Mage,or an Alchemist Archer,or an Chef Knight. and so forth.EDIT 1: The video on the store page is what the players of this game dream of.The game is still great,but there's just not a lot of player-to-player interaction anymore. If you want action in this game,you'll have to make it yourself. The servers aren't very crowded (hooray?).Sadly,almost everyone online is away-from-keyboard,BUT there are a few good souls who will be your friend and help you out.ORIGINAL:It's a good game,as far as I've played. It's controls will take some getting used to(space bar,for example,isn't a 'jump' button,but it's the combat mode on/off button).It's a manga/anime massivley-online multi-player role playing game. The Inventory isn't THAT big,not a problem for me,maybe for someone else,but not me. And MAN,you can choose you AGE when you are creating your character,so here's a game where you can kick rear as a six-year-old(I may be wrong). Gold isn't too hard to find,but you'd better be loaded when you go shopping!If you want to know the Plusses of the game,play for yourself,or read someone else's review,BUT PLEASE,NEXON,ADD BACK INTO THE GAME THE PARTNER SLOT!

												So, after very many hours and $75 i have to say that this is likely the best game i have played. This game isn't just good gameplay, the people i met have been amazing over the past year. When I was very depressed by some events, these friends of mine helped me up and brought me to be more open and be more social. The Gameplay is also very fun, this game updates atleast once a month. (keep in mind this is an 8 year old game) This game is the game of infinite possibilities, I am a giant that wears an alpaca mask and flies with purple butterfly wings. This is the game that seems to go on, even as a person that has never spent money on a microtransactions, this game changed that and I spent $75. This game is really fun even without spending money, the money is so you can get specials pets and even butlers and maids. This game is also very well made and doesnt take a powerful computer to run. I reccommend starting to play with friends, but you will end up with more friends after you find the right people. My guild has moved on to other games than just this one. I see very few flaws with this game.9.5/10 Gameplay10/10 Social Aspect8/10 Questing "

												Well, where to begin? This game has aged poorly in the aspect that it doesn't run too well on modern systems. Otherwise for being 8 years old it has a fairly active (and friendly) community. To this day it still sees updates and varying other things. This was one of my first MMORPGs (the other being Fiesta). Seeing it grow and change has amazed that something can run for so long. I wish they would've released Mabinogi 2 (not that Vindictus♥♥♥♥♥♥ so Mabi could continue to run for another generation of gamers. But onto the actual review and not nostalgia. This game is a very unique MMORPG being advertised as ""you can be anything!"" And it doesn't lie. You can be a singer, a battlemage,  a archer, or a combination of the varying amounts of skills in this game. The levelling system is unique as in you can level and then ""rebirth"" your character which results in removing your current levels but you keep your skills. Your levels are, in a sense, saved in a total level. Mine being about 500-700, is fairly low, especially seeing as I have friends who have multiple characters at 4K+ levels. One of the downfalls is the sort of need of pets because you'll eventually run out of space. Going onto another downfall is how poorly it runs on current systems. This game was made 8 years ago and it struggles to support current-end parts. The community, when they aren't AFKing in Dunbarton or wherever, are usually super friendly and are willing to guide you through almost anything. One thing I do miss is some of the people I used to play with when I was a lot younger but dropped Mabi due to IRL things and lost contact with. But even then, I've found new friends who in a sense replace them but are completely unique from my original friends. All in all, if you disregard the graphics, this is an amazing game that truly needs a reboot on a new engine.			"

												I'm going to re-write my review of this game, just because it has changed since I played it. Unfortinitly, my thumb is still going to point twords the floor.  This game has a good sized world, it has many skills, and over the years has had some very nice improvments and new content. It also still has many bugs and while new stuff does get added and older programming does get changed at times, older textures and meshes rarely ever get updated, specialy if they involve wearables.   I wont go over skills and such much, I recommend trying the game for yourselves for that, but I will warn you that this game is not great at being pay-free as some would like to say, as pets ($), while unneeded, are about as unneeded as a car is, it's not a great idea to advoid them. There are boosters and the such you can buy with money aswell, but most of these actualy are not needed unless you're looking for a edge, but pvp is kinda a dead joke in this game. Then you get Nexon's -Amazing- customer support, of which I can only assume work at EA as well. Really, you -will- get problems with them eventualy, eithor through payment info randomly being perma blocked or through them randomly banning accounts. I have not had my account banned, but I have had friends, ones that don't do stupid stuff, get banned for no reason and dispite many ticket requests never get a reason as to why or a way to defend themselves.   Another downfall of this game is the extream lack of keybinding. while you can shortcut some UI keys, anything skill-related you are stuck with # keys and F# keys. No exception unless you own a Naga, in which case... why are you looking at this game?! (To be fair, I do not own a Naga mouse, and am just assuming the hotkey-program that it uses will works with mabi)    Now, I have a lot of gripes with this game and its p*ss poor support, but I also have a lot of great memories with it. As the saying goes, it's not the game that makes it fun, it's the people, and there is a good amount of good people in this game. As a new player, you also get a good amount of story quests and exploration to do, which I highly recommend exploring the world before trying to save it.   It is not a bad game, more that it is ran by a bad company, which as much as it dissapoints me, is the main reason why I can not give this game a good review, because it is loosing players every year, and Nexon just keeps trying to milk it for money, providing new content as a way to try and draw new players in to their failing game. Unfortinitly, their business practices will not change, and that will keep most new players from staying.			"

You control your character much like any other point and click game, but Mabinogi has the audacity to not let me zoom out far enough to allow me to see all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I want to see. Good end user experience? Nope.Other than the fact that the game was uncomfortable to play, it has installs, starts, and uninstalls pretty well.			"

												Wellp. I just broke 1.6k hours. Recorded On Steam at least. I've been playing this game long before it was available on steam and I gotta say its one of my faveorite MMOs out there. The learning curve is steep and the engine is defiantly showing its age (over 10 years now) but it still has the core of what mmo's used to be like ages ago.  The sandbox elements are pretty good and despite the change of directors over the years shifting the design away from what it originally was I still find myself coming back.If you were to try this game you need to prepare to look over it's short comings due to the dated engine and be willing to learn it's systems as they are very different from other games and are not explained too well in game.

												Mabinogi is a very drab game. It advertises endless possibilities and mountains of content, when in reality the only real things you can do involve trading and stabbing bears. The combat is too lopsided, the story is too KAWAII-DESUUUUUU~ and the economy is a huge mess. Dungeons are boasted as in-depth and randomly generated, which they are (kinda). Small enemies can kill you just as quickly as you can kill them, and bosses require a couple of players (or luck, in most cases) to beat, which kills it for me because I like being able to solo most things. Armor does nothing, surprisingly, and you're better off saving your money up for weapons and potions than splurging on armor. There's also a wound system that requires you to use bandages before potions do any good, forcing you to waste even more time. Everything is a grind and nothing is rewarding. Good luck getting anything done. Trust me, you'll need it.			"

												Hi it's Mininight From Alexina Server Here.This is My personal Review on Mabinogi.First things first, I Am An Old, Player, Not the kind that afk, leave game open. I can usually be on most days of the week, But enough about me, this is about the game.This game Used to really give you the sense of Adventure, and exploring the continents, without so many moon gates and the moon gate book, It used to let everyone explore, you used to be able to be with friendly groups of people to hangout with  and do things in the game with, that aren't trolls, scammers. and worse Them Alts... etc. But now it's kinda full of them. You also used to get the feeling of achieving something good. That is gone now to.I don't like how every begginer player gets recomended to do ninja talent. That is unbelievably grindy, and ive done it. Will make you want to quit, For awhile. or forever. But i do like the reset feature benefit, But i think it needs to be explained more, To new players, So you can learn how to exactly train each skill and talent. Also Explain how to get ap from it, its a very useful feature, alot of people ignore, and don't know of it. This Game has so much Potential. But i don't like how its all going down the drain.The Market is really crazy, also can be very hard. If it's crafting or selling mats, all im going to say is that its super grindy and when you sell the stuff and or gear, People are willingly to buy it in bulk and under valued... So your kinda better off crafting for yourself or for your friends..Life skills are very Grindy and need to be updated badly. Same with obtaining some materials easier like fine finest leathers. Increasing the fishing list and have a fishing contest mini game. some other stuff to.The guild system has been alright, But that need to be updated to, especially the guild features Like The guild hall, should atleast be able to decorate it. Also the Guild robe. The Guild pvp has potential. At the moment not that good.pvp about pvp, It needs to be balanced properly, Also the pvp currently is kinda bad because its full of stunlocking, to me that's super cheap and boring...Commercing, I used to like commercing but i tend to get a dismounting/ mounting problem. Commercing can be fun and worth it, if the commerce shop gets updated, Bounty hunting can be fun. Rafting i used to enjoy rafting, But that honestly needs to be updated and it's really displacement buggy. Same with the rafting shop id like to see some better stuff in there. The current way of the Spirit Weapon System is Built it, ehh, Really not worth it, can take years to get the gems and powders and so much money to level one up Also maintain it's dura. Also Needs to Be updated. Like adding the rest of the weapons to the list. Repair rate I honestly think it should stay and be at 100% without having your item, losing max dura, because it'd cost so much to get the dura back up. That and upgrading enchanting and reforging an item is so costly, Nobody really deserves it being not useable. Because of dura.Shadow missions can be fun, But the end chests need new and better stuff. Would like to see new bosses, etc in them. Also new shadow missions. As for shadow crystals, People way overprice those now. The raids are fun. But all the other raids, other than girgashy and the black/white dragon, I think those need better drops. Girgashy raids though, when it comes to that, Most of the people i notice that do those, are really strict Unhelpful unfriendly elitists. They can be very troll like and rude, But the community and people in the game, should hang in there and try to help eachother out for there experiences to be better.Elves and giants. Now about both sides.  The players can have alot of racism between the two. Elves and Giants i admit they barely. Even Get anything good. Humans Practically get everything. Elves need Better archer skills. Also A melee talent and better magic for themselfs. Giants. I think should be able to duel wield all one handed melee weapons, not just swords and blunts. Idk why but you cant duel wield blunts as human same with axes, But with swords you can. Im not sure if you can with giants though. But im kinda doubting it. Humans also get alot of towns to themselfs, where as elves and giants just get one. Uladh could use some real good field bosses to though. Tory ravine, hasn't been unlocked yet. I kind of like how they changed the dungeons. The rewards and stuff to. The event's are mostly Afk events so you can make alot of gold selling the stuff from those. Some of the event's can be fun to. The Premium Service and VIP Service are outdated. Only good for housing.The thing is though, The game  currently Makes me feel like You have to pay to do something good, and worth doing. It's currently Building up more and more. But not into something worth doing. Like sure its free to play, but it  does feel like it's turning into a really bad free to pay, to regret it afterwards aswell. So that's it. That's my review It's really upto you and your preferances for your likings to the game.If anyone needs help with the game just note me ingame. Sorry for my bad grammar though.			"

												Hadn't been playing any MMOs in a while and then I found this. I would only recommend this game to those to has the time  to play this game. Mabinogi has varieties of systems and endless gameplay depending on what kind of player you are. But If you're a new player who wants to get into PVP right away you'll never be able to compete with players that has been in the server for years. Players that's been in for years are basically gods when it comes to pvp. Just don't bother trying to be the top PVP-er.Been playing for at least 2 weeks and i'll just list the pros and cons.Pros:-Fun-Various of systems ingame that'll keep you busy-Friendly players who are willing to help you and teach you (So far i haven't met a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Complex systems but at the same time once you get the hang of it you'll realize that its awesome.-Admirable and adorable stuff in it. If you like anime and dressing up your character in various ways this game is for you.Con:-Some stuff you have to actually use cash like pets. But you can get them through hard work which takes awhile if you have no time to grind.-This game is a grind fest. To get strong or craft better things you have to grind for it. In layman's term grinding is basically training to get more experience for your character. This game is the so time consuming and addictive once you get into it that it'll consume your soul and you'll be like FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUk . . . there goes another day . . . . .-Exploration experience is a B***H to obtain. Its one of the things I hate in the game cause you have to actually take hours of your time to grind for Exploration experience just to level your exploration level so that you can get your AP.All in all its a fun game. Just remember your the player. You're in control of the game not the other way around. Don't be played by the game fam . . .			"

												I hoghly reccomend this game. It was excellent when it came and is still excellent. Definitely not pay to win as all store items are purely cosmetics and or quest items.			"

												I approve of this game, but the issues that I had with the launcher/startup questioned if I would want to continue playing this or not.			"

												Waste your life away. spend hours and hours grinding skills. spend hours and hours grinding skills only to find out you're now too powerful for most of the monsters in the game so you can no longer level those skills. Says I have 1033 hours. I've been playing since 2008.15/10 can't stop, won't stop. "

												Okay, so. Having heard about this game, and seeing the mostly positive reviews, I decided to attempt to play it. However, once I managed to navigate the start up menu and create a character (and even that was a chore), I was just plopped in the world, with very little explination of what to do, no money and no weapon. I proceeded to wander around aimlessly until I got killed by a giant spider because I didn't know how to attack. Eventually, I managed to get a slim understanding of what I had to do. However, even so, the controls were so horrendus that I had a very hard time enjoying this game. In conclusion:Pros:-Amazing premise-Cute characters-Good storytelling-Player choiceCons:-Terrible controls-Hard to play-No guidance-The usual 'free-to-play-except-if-you-want-to-suceed-you-need-to-buy-things'			"

												When one first enters into Mabinogi, it will seem like a simple MMORPG.But it's not, it's like calling TF2 a simple FPS.What makes this game unique is how it gives so many approaches and how immersive it is.You can be a chef that smashes things with a hammer, or a puppeteer who fights by controlling puppets twice your size. And unlike most MMORPGs which take to grinding to make any money or levels, Mabinogi uses an intriguing and original way to avoid this droning method of advancement.While there is indeed content that requires real money that adds on to the experience. Playing it free by itself is still worthwhile and satiating for the gaming palette, especially if you enjoy immersion.			"

												I love Mabinogi, but just a note. Not very safe to play on steam due to broadcasting. People can find your secondary pass.			"

												Would never play anything Nexon after the let my account get compromised by in game users that try to exploit phishing apps that only need a user name. I gave nexon all the information I had even the time and person I thought was the one trying since they were harrassing me in-game. I ended Their customer service was no better it took them 6 months to have an automated message tell me they will get with my issue iin the order recived.If Nexon would get their act toegether they would possibly have a great mmorpg company, other than that I say play/pay at your discression.

												I remember loving this game but it wasn't very easy for me. Then for some reason I stopped and started playing World of Warcraft (which is sorta similar in my opinion) But, not wanting to pay those dreaded fees I decided to come back to Mabinogi. :D I love that it's free and still very close to WOW. Definitely worth playing. (plus I like the characters on here a lot better lol)			"
