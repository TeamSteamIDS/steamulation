01. GENRE: A Sci-fi boardgame adaptation with card driven encounters.02. SETTING: Chainsaw Warrior is based on the Games Workshop boardgame of the same name first released in the eighties.  It is set in a future version of New York, in the year 2032 which is under invasion from evil, otherworldy forces.03. STORY/BACKGROUND: A mysterious portal has appeared in the heart of the city from which deadly minions pour forth commanded by a dark malevolent force that calls itself Darkness.  After several failed counter-attacks to liberate the city a retired, almost forgotten war hero is called upon, to mount one last desperate attempt to thwart the evil that is about to consume the city and send it to the otherside of the portal.  As the player you take on the role of this soldier, armed to the teeth with the best gear science can offer.  With only an hour left before New York disappears forever, you face the toughest challenge of your glorious career.  Will you defeat Darkness in time?04. GAME MODES: As per the original boardgame; only one game mode - singleplayer.05. GAMEPLAY: Gameplay relies heavily on a combination of revealing consecutive cards and then choosing from a few key actions from the options that present themselves and/or rolling dice to determine the outcome of said actions.  Including combat, evading, discovering equipment, using items and avoiding/disarming traps. The games begins with the creation of a character by rolling the core stats, special abilities & starting equipment including: Melee weapons, firearms, heavy weapons, devices, clothing and special items. Once the player is ready they must reach and kill Darkness within an hour of game time.  Movement is abstracted with the turn of a card representing progress made towards your goal is located.  Every card and each action costs 30 seconds in time.  There are two decks of fifty-four cards, each deck representing a day and night cycle.  Cards consist of encounters with enemies, traps and obstacles designed to slow progress, discarded equipment and special transit cards.06. MECHANICS: There are no complicated mechanics.  A combination of dice rolls and modifiers are used to deterime character stats, combat and action successes or fails.  Different cards are used to represent encounters and other events.  They split into four main types: transit, enemies, inventory and traps.  The final boss is Darkness and has a special card.Equipment has a huge impact on success or failure.  Melee combat takes a weapon's modifier adds it to hand-to-hand skill and the roll of a dice, compared to the enemy's skill and dice roll.  Firearms require a certain roll equal to or less to a particular enemy from dice rolls and the marksmanship modifer.  Devices allow you to perform certain actions or provide modifiers and nulify penalties in combat or in a given situation like if it night.  Firearms are also limited by the amount of ammo in the magazines.If an enemy is encountered on any card the player can choose to shoot in the first turn of combat or engage in melee combat and thereafter remain in melee combat or attempt a special action.  Combat is determined with one or two dice rolls.  If the player loses a combat turn they take damage and lose 30 seconds.  If they win the enemy is killed.  In the event of a draw the player may be able to choose a special action such as: fleeing, taking a lucky shot or hiding.  Players are defeated by: dying in  combat, by radiation or venom, running out of time or facing Darkness without a special weapon.  Additional actions such as fleeing combat, hiding from enemies, taking a lucky shot can be made if the player is injured during a combat turn.There are several types of common enemies including: zombies and rat-packs with different combat stats.  Chaos agents are varied come with special abilites such as; forcing the player to drop equipment or the ability to KO the player and losing them a large amount of valuable time.  Mutants, Slime and the Meat Machine are tougher, rarer enemies that are particular difficult to kill and in turn can hurt or kill the player in quick-time.There are also around half a dozen different traps which have different effects on play such as: slowing the player down, disabling equipment or hurting the player.  All of these can be nulified or disarmed with equipment, devices or weapons if carried.  Day & Night is divided when you reach the 30minute mark.  During the night time your abilities suffer unless you are equipped with certain items and the enemies become stronger.  Fear not though as your character can encounter discarded items during their journey.Awaiting you is Darkness, the final encounter somewhere in the second deck. This end of game boss is a tough hombre and can only be defeated if equipped with either a Laser Lance or Implosion Vest.  The latter resulting in a stalemate.  Make no mistake Darkness makes for a worthy opponent and more likely that not you will die, even on Easy difficulty.07. A.I: Due to the simple yet elegant design no A.I is required.  08. GRAPHICS: These are minimal 2D art based creations.  Nothing amazing but they do the job and immerse you in the game's setting.  The cards are well-drawn and a little variation is used to add to the sense of immersion.09. INTERFACE & CONTROLS: Point and click.  Basic interface includes HUD showing player stats, encounter information and dice rolls.  Action buttons display according to options available.  Placement is pratical and efficient.10. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: A simple repetitive yet catchy tune in a Midi format plays continuously. It oozes atmospehere and captures the ambience of the setting, increasing in tempo as the action increases in pace.  Combat has some nice weapon effects.11. VOICE ACTING: There is none except in the opening cutscenes, unless you count the mocking laughter of Darkness as Voice acting.12. DIFFICULTY: There are three difficulties: Easy, Normal & Hard.   These affect the way in which player stats are determined at the start of the game.  Higher stats are more prevelent in Easy mode.13. PLAYTIME: 15-20 hours to complete all achievements.  Overall a typical game can take between 1 and 30 minutes depending on how long you manage to survive and reach Darkness.14. PROBLEMS: No problems other than achievements not working, mostly in the week after they were added.  On two occasions. That said the developer fixed them a week or so later.15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Overall there are no time-consuming or difficult.  They mainly consist of complete game at each difficulty level, perform x number of kills or actions, take y amount of damage, defeat Darkness z times. Perhaps the most difficult to discover is the achieve all 9 outcomes.16. DLC: No DLC.  But the game has a spin off - Chainsaw Warrior: Lords of Night.17. APPEAL: This game will appeal mostly to fans of the original boardgame and casual players, maybe those of you looking for some quick time-killing distraction that you can enjoy and forget.18. ENJOYMENT: Given the games limited scope, short games and repetitive nature it is very enjoyable in short spurts.  Ideal if you're waiting for something quick and need some distraction.19. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: The game was designed to be almost infinitely replayable, if rather repetitive.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: The game is fairly cheap and one that I purchased at full-price.  I haven regreted it one bit.VERDICT: A cheap enjoyable card-driven game.  Simple in its execution, elegant in its design, with a good deal of sophistication in its play.  If you are a fan of Games Workshop or the original boardgame, or fancy playing numerous short turn-around games then this is a good buy.  Its one of my favourite games.			"

												This is a game which must sell entirely on nostalgia value.I've never played the original - I bought it because I'm a fan of Games Workshop's non-core lines (Blood Bowl and Necromunda in particular are favorites), but I'd never even heard of this.The game is a series of dice rolls with no real strategic decisions to be made. The largest amount of influence you have is to decide what gear you buy at the start of the game, after that a Choose Your Own Adventure novel allows more player agency. You get to decide whether to try to shoot before engaging in melee with enemies. That's the full sum of your available decisions in at least 90% of the average game.I suppose if you are really bored it might be worth it at 50% off. Do not buy this expecting the Games Workshop magic, though. This is one of their earliest offerings and it shows.			"

												This game is a digital version of an old board game that has quite an interesting concept and idea behind it. Survive long enough and oppose all kinds of enemies and obstacles in order to defeat the final boss. The game itself is neatly presented and it looks quite good at first, especially for a solitaire board game.Unfortunately the nature of the game is very dependant on random number generation, from the character creation to the combat rolls. Which kind of makes it extremely random and luck dependant rather than skill and careful planning. Furthermore your options as a player are severely limited. Sometimes you will have to manage your inventory and what kind of items you want to take or use but overall you will just throw dice over and over. Each encounter is resolved by dice rolls and it's absolutely not spectecular nor interesting. At some point you are just so bored because it is not a very involving process. Also the actual animations are so minimal, that you won't get any excitement out of it.Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of board games and I do not mind minimal graphical presentation but this game is shallow and very boring at best. There is nothing that makes you want to come back, perhaps just if you ownd the original game as a kid and feel nostalgic towards it.			"

												Too random, no possibility to make any significant choices beyond choosing the proper equipment after re-rolling the stats a few times, and in the end it just boils down to often failing 1:6 (or less) checks which usually result in immediate death.Was fun for maybe an hour, before the pattern became clear and uninteresting.

""Between the time when Snake Plissken escaped New York and the appearance of Predator aliens in central american jungles, there was a game undreamed of. And into this, the Chainsaw Warrior, destined to bear the Laser Lance slung over a cybernetic shoulder. It is I, this reviewer, who alone can tell you of his suicide mission. Let me tell you of the minutes of heroic sacrifice.""Chainsaw Warrior was an old board game by Games Workshop, created in 1987. This version is a direct adaptation of that game. For this reason, it may appear overly simplistic for many computer gamers. Beings from another dimension threaten to destroy New York and you, a cybernetically enhanced elite warrior (think 6 Million Dollar man meets Snake Plissken) have 60 minutes to get in the quarantine zone, fight your way through zombies and mutants and reach the big bad ""Darkness"" and hope you'll be able to kill it.""Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. The Chainsaw Warrior will be that man. Better than he was before. Better... stronger... faster.""You roll 6-sided dice to create your chainsaw warrior and pick your starting equipment.How many dice you roll depends on which one of the three difficulty levels you choose. While all have the potential for the same stats, on higher difficulties these are more random.Equipment is either chosen freely on Easy or blindly on higher difficulties.""New York, 2023: The entire city is on the brink of destruction. The old municpal buildings' staircases are mined. The elevators are booby trapped. And an apoclyptic cult has everything locked down. They think. Based on the board game by Stephen Hand, Auroch Digital's Chainsaw Warrior:One man must go in where no man stands a chance to ever get out. And if he fails his mission, our nightmare has just begun.""The game comprises of you turning over cards from a deck, each card being one room you search. Once the first 54 card deck is done, you proceed to the second one which includes Darkness. But the clock is ticking: each turn of a card, each round of combat, each other action are 30 seconds and there are 108 cards to turn. So you have to move through the building as fast as possible, conserving ammo and trying not to die of radiation or poison or zombie bites. In the end, when you finally get to Darkness, it may all come down to one stupidly lucky roll of double sixes. But that is what suicide missions with only a remote chance of success are all about.""So, did the Chainsaw Warrior banish the evil Darkness to its home dimension. And having no further concern, he returned to his hole-in-tjhe-wall appartment. Many cans of beer did the Chainsaw Warrior drink, trying to numb the memories. Yet honor and glory were heaped upon his name and, in time, he was called to save the world once more... And this story shall also be told."" "

												Similar Game(s):Chainsaw Warrior The Board GameThe Good:A quick pick-up & play game that can be played and beaten in 15 – 40 minute bursts (depending on how well you roll your starting stats)Due to the board game it is replicating, all the mechanics are in the open and based off six-sided dice rollsOpening comic is very slick and sets the scene for the upcoming game-playArtwork is well drawn and retains the original board game’s motifA high difficulty level that rewards diligenceCard descriptions are straight-forward and easy to understandVery rewarding to finally beat the game, on any of the three difficulty settingsThe Bad:Tutorial is lacking for those not familiar with the original board game from 1987Unexplained abbreviations are common and some important game-play mechanics aren’t fully explained (I’m looking at you, guns)Moderate level of chance present with every play-through, which can cause frustration when having a lengthy play sessionAdmittedly this is less of a problem for the Easy mode, which allows you to pick your equipment before heading forth to save the worldThe difficult-to-beat ending was anti-climactic and gone after a mouse click.  It would have been nice to have been treated with another interesting comicVoice acting during the comic is a little monotonous, which doesn’t fit with the well produced comic animationsThis is very minor, but I must have sat through 20 “how to play the game” tutorial iterations before I noticed the “Replay Tutorial?” button in the options screenThe tutorial was quite helpful the first time around, but maybe after that it should automatically switch the option to “NO” in the options screenCan you play it while the children are awake?:I felt like the artwork was a little too gory for them to be taking in.  Though the gameplay is pretty tame (virtual dice roll across the screen in place of “actions”), I feel the zombie pics on the cards would be a little too much for younger ones.Did I make time to complete it?:I felt compelled to beat the game on Easy mode.  The learning curve was steep in the beginning (not having played the original), but I persevered and became victorious!  A little achievement pop-up hasn’t felt so rewarding since beating Super Meat Boy.Recommended Purchase Price:$4.99or100% of full retail price of $4.99Reviewer:MisterS42http://www.gamersglance.com "

												Single player card game where you dig through two 54 card decks on a time limit to defeat the very uniquely named big bad, ""Darkness"". Most card games have enough randomization because of the shuffling of cards, luck of the draw, and so forth, but for some reason Chainsaw Warrior feels the need to add die rolls to almost every action, including stats during character creation. On Hard difficulty the game can be over before its even begun because of bad die rolls for stats or bad card draws for equipment (because you're only allowed to chose catagory, not specific items). [Quick anecdote: Mark Rosewater at WotC noted that the main reason the Star Wars CCG failed was because fans hated having to roll dice for everything in a card game.]Even if you perfectly pick your loadout and get decent stats, many cards in the play decks have incredibly gamebreaking abilities. For example, one card makes you reshuffle all the cards in the deck and start over, another will break your sole win condition weapon, and another will make you lose several turns (randomly decided how many, of course). The most frustrating part is these cards might as well say ""You Lose!""... but they just tease you into playing an unwinnable game. Many cards also have stat debuffs (zombie venom or radiation) that stack over time and are difficult to remove, providing yet another way for you to lose the game.Of course, being a cheap, direct iOS port also brings a slew of other issues. A touch screen interface with gigantic oversized buttons, ""click-click-click to play"" gameplay, and worst of all, savescumming. The decks are shuffled at the start of the game and are never reshuffled unless you trigger a certain trap. While this is realistic, it makes for bad video game gameplay. To put it simply, you can save the game every card and reload if you make a huge mistake or if you want to redo a fight (even the end boss!). This removed all of the challenge and distilled the game down into simple die rolls and restarts. While it is ignorable, you will still probably restart the game when you pull one of the previously mentioned ""almost game-ending"" cards.Chainsaw Warrior was probably a lot more fun to play sitting on the couch on a weekend afternoon but is a huge headache in its poorly ported video game form. Only recommended for nostalgic value or for owners of the original game.			"

												Okay, time to show off just how much of an old-school, dyed-in-the-wool, sad♥♥♥♥♥♥nerd I really am: I used to own this board game back in the day, and it's a SINGLE PLAYER BOARD GAME. That's how sad I am...er, WAS (I would never do anything like that nowadays, except for innumerable recent games of Arkham Horror by myself...but apart from that, NEVER)!!!This is the first time I've tried one of these literal board game conversions, and I must say I do find it all a bit odd as a concept, but that aside this is about as successful as something like this could ever have been. And I've just spent a solid few hours trying to conquer all three difficulty levels, so there's obviously something a little bit compelling about it all. Having said that, I suspect there's a not a great deal of replayability once one has gained all three - count 'em, THREE - achievements, and I'm already two down, so how much this is worth the measly five buck asking price is up to you. My advice would be to wait til it's on sale, and then the heck with it...how much playing time do you expect for two or three dollars? Skyrim won't be that cheap anytime in the next decade, so by all means, if you're as big a nerd as me, and want a taste of what we old ♥♥♥♥ers used to play BEFORE the Playstation 1 even existed, then it's surely worthwhile as a curiosity piece if nothing else. By the time I conquer all three difficulties I probably will have wasted five hours of my precious life, so that's about a buck an hour. Only the cheapest of cheapskates can balk at that kinda logic, surely...Verdict: 8/10.			"

												Fantastic little game that really can suck you in - great atmosphere, super-cheesy plot about saving New York from a horde of monsters out of this world, nice visuals and sound (keep in mind though, this is a the recreation of a 80's tabletop card/dice game). The game itself has no real flaws - except for one (but this is down to personal preferences): if you don't like randomness, plus rolling d6 OVER AND OVER is not your thing, you can stop reading now - this is not for you. That being said, rolling the dice in Chainsaw Warrior is seriously FUN.pros:- random, mindless and utterly stupid- great atmosphere and visuals- very addictive- fantastic animated dicescons:- random, mindless and utterly stupid- can become tedious after a while- the whole concept of the game - if rolling d6 isn't your thing			"

												Hey, did you ever want to play Chainsaw Warrior but didn't want to look like a total forever alone playing a board game BY YOURSELF? You're in luck, because now it's on Steam and mobile devices as a video game! It's brutally hard, so much so that while doing research for this review, I read that a dude who started playing this game in 1987 never got so much as a single win from the game in over 25 years. He became MEGA-PUA, Godzilla's latest nemesis. Losing streaks like these are a result of dice-based mechanics combined with card-based ♥♥♥♥ery, which results in this game being a big ol' pile of NERD GAMBLING. However, I thoroughly enjoy this because it is possible to get around those disadvantages and find a way to outwit and cleave through enemies like nothing, so it is possible to have a fighting chance. I enjoyed it, but I don't feel I'm going to enjoy it all that longer. But it's cheap and you can throw on some music from Thomas Barrandon in the background to enhance the experience.			"

												One of the first Games Workshop board games of the same name, this single player card and dice based game faithully recreates the experience in the digital world. Drenched in 80s sci-fi design pathos, Chainsaw Warrior drips in macho macheesmo and over the top mutated baddies. Gameplay is based off rolls of the dice, and drawing of cards consisting of ""Traps"", ""Enemy"" and ""Empty"". Each drawing of a card will subtract 30 seconds from the timer. It's a simple mechanic that's easy to grasp and makes for some truly random game sessions. Controls are simple, sounds and graphics are passable, and the UI presents everything on screen that is needed in a clear and easy to read format. Staying true to the original , it can be quite challenging and depending on the luck of the draw, you could be restarting within the first few minutes. Not for those who will be frustrated easily with ""unfair"" losses and bad luck. Those looking for something unique, and a decent time waster that you can hop in and play for a few quick sessions should consider this a go.			"

												A Games Workshop fan of the 1980's will probably remember this. I however was neither of these. In fact it wasn't until the Exploration Sale (2014), that I found this game whilst browsing the usual Warhammer 40k games and came across this little gem. Since I'm neither a child of the 80's, nor was I a Games Workshop fan, I believe I can provide a fresh, unbiased review of this game. So please bear with me.First off, this game is completely about the luck of the roll. You roll for everything in this game, and I love it! You begin the game with a comic strip intro, and then you begin the game. You have to roll d6's to get your stats. There are no RPG ""select this stat?"" After you have rolled for your stats, you get some basic points that you can use to aquire weapons, HTH (Hand To Hand) weapons, and or clothing. But you must keep in mind you have a very, and I do mean very, limited amount of points, which usually for me, winds up being one gun, one HTH weapon, and that is all.After all this prep you begin the game full. You are thrust into New York with a background picture, on your left are cards, to your right, your actions. You turn a card face up, and then you proceed from there. Once you turn it face up, if it is an enemy, you must roll the d6, depending on what you chose. As a short example. Say you turn over a card and it is a zombie, you select say HTH, once done, a combat roll will happen and based on your starting stats, you must equal or beat a certain roll. Or conversely, you can use your weapon, say a rifle. If you roll badly though, you can and will miss and as a last resort, you will be forced into HTH or even made to try and escape the threat.You go through the apartment blocks, and roll your way to victory! But not all the cards are of course enemies, you have some empty room cards, to which you must roll your d6's to see if anything lurks around the corner. You can get item cards, medical pack cards etc. But the majority of what you will be doing is rolling against the cards that are enemies. Once you have a chance to escape a building, you must roll through some more cards to make it out alive. Which if like me, you have been left with nothing but your HTH weapon, can be very tense. To make it to the end you need good rolls, and you need to watch your bottom bar which includes a venom and radiation meter. If either fill up, it doesn't look hopeful for you. Amongst the threats lurking behind each card backing, is the ever present timer. Everything you do takes time. Be it reloading a weapon. Using an item. And such. Once it becomes night, your stats may go down and it may just get that bit extra harder. As if it wasn't hard enough!I'd recommend this game based on it's original HARD difficulty alone as it is brutal and who knows if you will get the rolls you need. If you're a die fan, then sadly this game only uses d6 dices. The game has the mentallity for just ""one more roll, I just need one more good roll!""You will be pulling your hair out with bad rolls.			"

												I recommend this game, but with caveats. Not because Auroch Digital have done a bad job (they've done a faithful conversion) but rather that the original card/board game it was based on was brutally hard and would frequently screw you over with dice rolls and bad card draws.On the other hand, as I am an owner of the original Chainsaw Warrior game (and the extra equipment cards from White Dwarf magazine) from way back when it was released in 1987 I was always going to like this game. The digital version of the game allows me to play it much quicker.The Game:You take on the title role of the Chainsaw Warrior, fighting your way through a haunted building in New York filled with Zombies, Chaos Cultists, Mutant creatures, Rats and traps to the final boss. Your ultimate aim is to defeat Darkness, an evil being from another dimension who is intent on destroying you, the city and everyone in it because reasons. Mwuhahahaha! (cue spooky music)Play is basically flipping through a card draw pile and dealing with the various encounters along the way. You are armed with weapons & equipment to help you beat the enemies & hazards blocking your path to Darkness. What gear you choose at the start is critical (pick the Chainsaw!), but more often than not the evil dice will defeat you long before you reach the final boss.The Good:+ destroy Zombies with a Chainsaw+ plays just like the original game + quick easy setup & play since you don't have to track dice rolls, counters & cards yourself+ comic book style card art & themed interface icons from the original+ atmospheric music and combat effects+ reasonably priced+ good replayabilityThe Bad:- plays just like the original game- dice rolls will be cruel- you may fail due to a bad draw- not especially deep- your decisions, while important, will often be trumped by random chanceThe odd:- only some of the optional equipment cards from ""Life & Death & An American Chainsaw"" are in the game (an odd decision)- sadly the great Brett Ewins artwork from the original box & comic is not used (copyright issues I guess)In Summary:Buy it if you owned (or wanted to own) the original and loved itBuy it if you want to play a unique piece of 1980's Role play gaming historyBuy it if despatching Zombies with a Chainsaw appeals to youAvoid it if you hated the original since this is just the sameAvoid it if losing often to an unlucky dice roll sends you into a frothing rageBuy it if it's ever on saleGift it to friends who like Zombie games and movies			"

												Chainsaw Warrior is the digital treatment to a 1987 solitary style board game.  Yes, you read that right, board game & solitary style together.  Amazing, I know.  Leave it to the fine folks at Games Workshop, known world wide for making table top games, to invent such a thing.30 Second Review + Very challenging!+ Stats sheet, dice, character customization through random rolls.+ Each game is a unique experience due to the randomness of the dice and cards.- Solitary style game that may get repetitive and boring over time.- Can reach the end, but it may be impossible to kill the boss even if you do.Click this link to read more!http://everydaygamers.com/2014/03/07/review-chainsaw-warrior/#more-29274 "

												I may not have played the original card game, but this digital adaptation is simple yet marvelous. The game itself plays out like a randomized card-game version of a rogue-like. I've seen many complaints about the unfairness of this game, due to its randomized nature and all, but I can't help but feel it's an unfair assumption to assume that just because it's a card game that this game is inherently intended to be a purely strategic experience. What it is at its core, is a quick-playing ride into hell. Winning is a rarity - I haven't even won one game myself, but I still like to come back to it for a quick playthrough now and then, because it's easy to learn and fun to experiment with. It's nothing more than quick romps through bloodshed and randomized weaponry, but it doesn't pretend to be more than that either. That, and although its randomized nature - including randomizing the player's selection of weapons and items - may make it seem as though there isn't any room for strategy at all, the game does indeed have strategy in the same way most gambling games do. You're hedging your bets. Betting that larger firepower won't be necessary, betting that the monster around the bend WON'T be a radioactive sludge beast, betting you can open that door without wasting bullets and thus saving precious extra in-game time to complete your mission. You'll come close, it might be painful. But this is the kind of pain I like from a game.			"

												Bundle fodder. I would have liked this okay as a card game as a teenager, but it's super simplistic, lacking in any strategic depth, and not well suited to a digital port.It's a player vs deck solo card game where most of the cards are either a monster (combat), good event (heal / find an item) or bad event (take damage, lose x turns unless you have item y). Combat is a pair of 2d6 rolls + a basic combat stat. The presentation is okay but the UI is overly complicated for such a simple game.Unless you have serious nostalgia for the original card game, there's nothing to see here.			"

												A card-based game, developed by Auroch Digital, it brings this Games Workshop title to life on PC. The concept and story are relatively simple: You are a super-soldier, and New York is about to be swallowed up by a black hole caused by ‘the Darkness’, a mysterious unknown entity of evilness and evil. It’s up to you to chainsaw the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the Darkness and its forces, and to not let New York be sucked into an abyss in the process – you have an hour. Good luck!As simple as the premise is, so too is the gameplay - you do anything, you roll dice. Essentially, the gameplay consists of location cards, each of which holds a certain event, and you need to deal with that event using your weapons, items, or just by moving on when there’s a clear room. Of course, chainsaw-ing a zombie in the face is still satisfying.The sound is simple, but you’re basically just looking at the same screen with a different card all the time, so there’s not much complexity to be had, and whilst the art for the cards looks nice, don’t expect too much. Again, cards, not a 3D FPS or the like.This particular title will probably be of great interest to Games Workshop fans, but new adopters may want to at least check the title out through reviews (see our video above) and the like before buying, as the replay value of it might be rather low to many.

												Did you like Chainsaw Warrior as a card game or do you enjoy simple randomly generated games with little influence from yourselves in a neat setting? If yes then you will enjoy Chainsaw Warrior for what it is. If you were expecting anything more then you won't find it here.The game involves creating a character via the use of dice and a selection of equipment cards. After that you'll go into the main game which has you clicking through a deck of cards to see what random events you come across, which can be traps, monsters, secret passages etc. At each event you can select between a couple of choices like using a item or attacking. Everything you do is delivered through the dice.The presentation is okay. The art is mostly from the card game I guess, animations are basic and sound assets aren't anything special, the intro comic is quite neat though. But to me it feels so much more could've been done with this setting, like having the Warrior and Mutants visually on the screen and having them fight it out etc.I bought the game during a sale for a couple of dollars which to me feels like the right price for this game. The game is ok but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone except to people who want a digital version of the card game. The game length is also very short, but due to the random nature it can take you between 30 minutes - 3 hours depending on difficulty.			"

Picked up this copy on Steam partly to support the devs and partly just because, you know, sometimes you just want to save New York with a mouse rather than your fingers.It's basic, it's painful, it's entertaining.  And I wouldn't have it any other way.Two thumbs up.			"

												Super fun, old school (original board game came out in late 80s) solo dice/card game--which was most likely invented by SATAN!  You have 60 minutes to beat The Darkness and save NYC.  You roll for stats, pick equipment and enter a building.  There are things like zombies, traps, and other random stuff that you roll (and DIE!!!) against.  It is really hard...just when you think you have it beat, it beats you down.  Especially that fat, green jerk The Slime.Give it a try!  It's also available on Android and iOS if you want to play while you are on the crapper or on the bus.  For $5 on Steam and $4-ish on mobile it's a no brainer...you'll get your money's worth!			"

												Chainsaw Warrior is a game that is very challenging, and is not for everyone. For those that can get into Card and Dice based game play, then you will find this a fun and challenging treat. Based/Remade to resemble the 1987 board game, this game pits one cyber commando on a near impossible mission to wade through tons of traps, mutants, abominations and zombies until he meets and defeats his hardest foe yet, Darkness! The game uses a simple D6 based rule system. One of the really neat features of the game is you start off by rolling your character stats and equipment options. The built in tutorial does an ok job of explaining everything, there where a few occasions where i was left wondering how the game decided on a certain number i had to meet or beat. This game is no pushover, and sometimes a bad roll of the dice will just ruin you. For me, that's the fun in it, trying to bounce back from an already bad situation. Even though the odds are stacked against you, there are plenty of goodies and items to help you along your way. All items offer different perks and stat boosts, allowing you to approach the game in a few different ways. Sporting three difficulty modes, it helps oneself get used to how the game works and allows for you to experiment with weapon and item combinations.Its a simple game at its core, but it has excellent replayability due to its hard difficulty curve and random encounters/events. Pick it up if you are into boardgames or looking for a challenge. The Doctor Approves.			"

												For $5.00, is this game worth it? My answer would be yes, as despite the random, luck based nature of the game, and its brutal difficulty, there is some enjoyment to be had here. It's based on a single-player card and dice game from the 1980s. I hadn't heard of it until the release of this version. I find it odd that it is single player as I can see the premise working well with multiple people, but I digress.In this game, you choose a difficulty, and roll dice for your stats. Depending on your difficulty, you'll roll 1-3 dice and take various values, explained in game for your stats. Then you roll for so many equipment points, and you decide what type of equipment to take with you on your journey. From there, it comes down to what cards you draw and what equipment you have. Your goal is to get through one deck of 54 cards, and then through a second deck until you find ""Darkness"", the ultimate evil looking to destroy the city. Oh, and you only have one hour to do this. Every time you draw a card or engage in combat you lose 30 seconds, and you can lose time for other reasons as well. If you run out of time, well, that's it, you lose. This game takes pleasure in screwing you, in various ways. For instance, it's entirely possible that the only weapon that can defeat the final boss, The Laser Lance, can be destroyed during the course of your game, or you can run out of ammo for it, and have to start a deck all over to get a new one. You can be forced to start over due to running into a giant chasm, running into a locked door without a way to open/break it, etcetera.Despite this frustration, there is enjoyment to be had here, and for $5.00, you can't really go wrong.

												Only buy the game if you like playing for achievements and it's on sale. Other than that do not buy it.The game is a card/board game where 85% of the game is decided at the very begining. You start by rolling dice for your stats and gear. Then you start drawing cards at random until you meat the Darkness. The cards can be monsters, events, traps or aid. Your starting stats and gear will determine if you succeed at these events. There are very very limited choices you can make. There is no graphics to speak of. The card illustrations are average. Average playtime is 15-30 mins.So if you dont play for achievements it is very unlikely that you will play this game more than twice as it will become boring very quickly.			"

The good thing about it's nearly impossible difficulty is that it adds plenty of replay value to the game. I certainly enjoyed it! This game is definitely not for everyone so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you buy it. This game is based off a card/board game made back in the late 80s and you roll dice to determine your stats and when you're in battle. If you're into strategy card/board games and ready for a challenge then this is for you. Otherwise I would reccomend you stay away and get a different game.			"

												This solo card game is more difficult to win than the lottery.  It is beatable on easy, but on the more difficult levels its all up to RNG.  You roll up your stats randomly, you chose your weapons and other equipment at random, you may use gear during the game on an unlucky card draw, and each combat encounter is resolved randomly.  And if that wasn't enough you are racing the clock to find the ""Darkness"" and kill it with your trusty laser lance.  The odds are definately stacked against you.  But still there is something about this game that I like.  Maybe I like the retro feel of the game, or creeping tension, or maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment.			"

												Seeing Chainsaw Warrior on sale for $2, and knowing that it was a digital version of an old Games Workshop game I figured I would give it a chance. In the worst case I would get a few steam trading cards and kill some time. In this game you take the role of a soldier whose job is to save the city. You have a limited amount of gear and a mere 60 minutes to fight your way through two decks worth of monsters and traps before using your Laser Lance (or implosion vest) to destroy “The Darkness”.The game is very unforgiving and you should expect to lose. It is strongly recommended that you start with easy mode, the game is brutal enough that you will still need to fight tooth and nail for victory. Though the mechanics are mind-numbingly simple, the pressure of saving the world in “60 minutes” was surprisingly intense. Perhaps I just had the right mindset, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you haven’t already, watch the official trailer on the store page. It shows you exactly what to expect. The rules and interface of the game are most at home on a tablet, it makes no use of desktop capabilities. In fact, unless you want the steam cards, you should buy the tablet version instead. To those who haven’t watched the trailer, you click to turn over cards, you click to choose an action, you click next and then repeat the process. Though the game is largely mindless clicking with everything determined by dice rolls there is an element of strategy. You have a limited amount of time and resources to defeat The Darkness. Do you shoot now knowing you won’t have enough ammo to shoot through the next door you encounter? Do you run or hide? Do you charge head on with a chainsaw? Do you take the secret passage to travel faster but possibly miss out on finding supplies? There are lots of little choices which influence the game.To enjoy the game you need to overlook some glaring flaws. As previously mentioned everything is random, even the equipment you start with. You may need to restart several times just to have a character with a fighting chance. There are also encounters which destroy equipment making the game even more unwinnable. To top it off there are the slimes which can kill you with one lucky roll. Despite these flaws I am thoroughly enjoying the game and intend to play until I complete all the achievements. Its an excellent time killer and you can save and quit whenever you want. I don’t really think its worth $5, but its certainly worth getting on sale. "

												Chainsaws are exciting. Warriors are thrilling. And yet, somehow, Chainsaw Warrior is not quite the be-all-end-all of gaming experiences I hoped it would be. Even so, it's still more enjoyable than any other sci-fi horror Solitaire game on the market. In this PC port of a one-player card game from Games Workshops, you play as the eponymous CHAINSAW WARRIOR, a cybernetically-enhanced combat veteran called back in for one more job - to save New York from a teeming horde of extra-dimensional monstroids led by the entity known only as DARKNESS. After a bit of preliminary character creation (which you have almost no say in), you are sent out into the urban disaster zone to murder your way to the top, hopefully with enough equipment remaining that you can take down the big galoot at the end and save New York from devastation.The game plays out simply, and although it's highly dependent on luck, there's enough strategy and decision making involved to keep it interesting. After character creation, you head out into the city and are given one hour (120 turns) to plow through the two decks of encounter cards. Although there are some helpful encounters out there (empty rooms, ammo dumps, or short cuts if you're really lucky), most encounters are monsters or traps. Each encounter is likely to injure, poison, irradiate, or simply delay you, any of which will eventually kill you, so it's in your best interests to rush through encounters as quickly as you can. Actually clearing out both decks is next to impossible, but fortunately you (probably) won't have to. The final boss, DARKNESS, is shuffled randomly into the second deck, so you might only need to draw a single card from it to face him... or you might plow through all but one card and die, having performed a Herculean feat but still losing anyway.Which brings me to the fact that this game is just absurdly unfair. No matter how skilled you are, six-sided dice are fickle things. One bad roll against a monster capable of killing you in a single hit will just end your game. The last boss can only be killed with two particular items, and they can be destroyed or run out of ammo along the way. An early encounter with a monster that reduces your stats permanently can hamstring an otherwise promising hero. Heck, just rolling awful stats in the very beginning, or getting lousy randomly selected equipment, can ruin your chances of victory before you even set foot into the battlefield. It's all aggravating, and the character generation process is drawn out more than it needs to be, and there's no quick reset option, and aaaaugh i hate you i hate you i hate chainsaw warrior diiiiiiie....But honestly, winning isn't everything. There's something satisfying about the unpredictable generosity of dice rolls, very much along the lines of rolling a nat 20 and wresting victory from the jaws of defeat. As you play, you learn what threats you'll encounter, how the various items can compensate for your lousy stat rolls, and when it's justifiable to pull out your big guns and waste your precious, precious ammo. And on top of all that, the art style and general aesthetics are just the right kind of schlock 80's cyberpunk crap I adore, mixing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoonery with the occasional spot of authentically disturbing monster design... Just try to ignore the painfully bad voice-acting in the opening cut scene. I'm not about to call this a good game exactly, but it's certainly fun for a while, and the price tag is very easy on the wallet.			"

												Very Good game. Never played the original physical game, but i'd imagine that this would do it great justice.Its ridiculously hard, even on easy difficultly the entire mechanic of the game is there to screw you over, its fun but irritating, frustrating and sometimes downright hilarious when it all goes wrong in just a few turns (especially when you've had some really lucky rolls whilst creating your characters stats)Ive not finished the game yet (even on easy) but i can imagine that it would extremely satisfying to finally get through.If you are a fan of the ""Choose you own Adventure"" books this will probably be something you'll enjoy.

												A very well done game I must say.Story - *SPOILERS* It is centered around the chainsaw warrior *you*, trying to save the world from creatures that came from another universe by a portal. You must slaughter countless zombies, rats, machines and other monsters to get to the final boss and success in defeating him.Gameplay - You roll with dices to decide what happens, so the game is basically almost all based on luck. First you roll on how well your characters stats are, choose your equipment, and go battle. I must say the battles get somewhat repetitive after a while, though that doesn´t change the awesomeness and randomness of the cards. Verdict - The game tried to replicate the old card game, and it did well. The game has very suitable graphics, art style and game mechanics for it´s type. The music is quite enjoyable as well. For me, it deserves a solid 8/10. I would recommend it to anyone who likes card games. The minus points for it not being realistic, I mean, my chainsaw ran out of petrol after 2 victims c;. Enjoy!

												If you love boardgames, you'll enjoy ""Elder Sign"" more than this... I love board games and think this game is Okay -- but there needs to be more to it to justify it's existence. Decent for what it is (a very unforgiving solo board-game experience) -- it was fun, but there is not much going on and it really could have profited from a bit more effort to bring the game to the computer screen. If you are a Rabid fan of the board/card game -- you'll enjoy this for it being no muss, no fuss. But if you are a video gamer and not exclusively looking for a board-game experience here... keep on walking. Decent, but can't recommend it.			"

												Disclaimer: this score is full of sarcasm and irony. As always.Score out of 10:-Graphics: 1.0-9.0, what should I say...? It's a real Card game, with, you know, real cards...-Game engine: 6.2, has some minor flaws, like ""keybindings"" options without even working keys, except mouse, and long waiting time for main menu, but that's all acceptable.-Game mechanics: Board version 8.0 / Binary version 0.0 (it's not a smile), see below.-Game addiction: 9.5, like any Rogue-like game with permadeath. Updated: 7.0-Gameplay: 8.1, big mark for such simple concept, but it's interesting.TOTAL: 1d6+4So, it's hard to judge this game for two reasons. First of all, it's a digital remake of old board game. Second of all, it's a 2014 now.Game developers had not so many options to make it nice to old fans and new-coming players (Should I mention fresh digitalizers like Space Hulk and Talisman or should I search for something older?). At least they can make user interface perfect, while you are not able to change or improve game mechanics. Why I can not turn ""intro"" comics OFF by default? Why the hell all three active areas (Cards deck, HTH-Shoot-da-Whoop and Roll buttons, Continue button) are in three different corners of the screen? Why asking always for something, that's present in single (weapon for Hth, for example). Why always Rolling character in beggining with SO many dumb button press? There is a rule of thumb: program should wait for user interaction IF and ONLY IF user can change the state of program. Here you have to press 7 times some ""skip""-like button, just to see numbers appear on the screen. Hell, thanks, but no.On the one hand, game mechanics are pure random in nature: ""adventure map"" - shuffled card deck, combat - dice based. You'll be shouting on your PC :D for sure.On the other hand, game is hard to play and has a ""moment of choice"", moreover game will always punish you for mistake. You are not only skipping turns, waiting for some ""random"" output and lucky end. You have enough possibilities to change outcome, though they are limited.The original game lacks of ""horizontal balance"": most of ingame items (cloth, weapon, device) can be separed on usefull in 100%  cases and useless in 100% cases. That's bad. Another problem is small amount of such items at all. With all that said: it was fun to play. Please read AGAIN the total score I put in header for this game. It makes more sense than it seems to be: 1d6+4 out of 10.			"

												So Chainsaw Warrior is definitely fantastic... if you played the board game. It is pretty much a perfect recreation of the game with some added value like no shuffling or card management and easy/medium modes. Even on easy where you get a thumb on the scales for your stat rolls and you get to choose your equipment, it's not guaranteed that you'll make it through to kill The Darkness.You might hit the chasm, not have a rope launcher or the climbing skill and have to backtrack out of the building and lose time. The wretched lunatic might steal your IR goggles or, god forbid, your chainsaw. You might fail a reflex roll and break equipment in a fall. There are a lot (!) of ways to fail.And hard mode, which is the pure board game form, is brutal. Satisfyingly brutal. Killing The Darkness on hard is a nice mix of good choices and good luck.Having played and loved the game once upon a time, it's hard for me to peek out from behind my nostalgia colored glasses (for us children of the 80's, it's probably a Miami Vice pastel...) to know whether to recommend the game to folks without that tie to the past. The game is certainly fun, but there is a certain amount of clicking through mob zombies en route to more interesting cards that's not especially exciting after the first 50+. And a lot of the game is watching what unfolds. There are actual player decisions to be made, but not every turn. A lot of times you are sort of reacting to what the cards have in store for you. It's almost a randomized adventure game in that sense. And the mechanics are a bit unbalanced. Shooting requires a reflex check to even be able to fie and has limited ammo whereas hand to hand is one roll. If you play on Easy, take the Chainsaw. :)It's a great version of a great old board game. Hard as nails, patently unfair, good for a quickie 20-30 minute gaming session and deeply satisfying when on hard with randomized equipment you make your reflex check and shoot that smug prick The Darkness in the face.

There is litterally no skill involved, the entire game is based off random chance of dice rolling and your function is simply to push the ""Next"" button. The story was weaksauce, the art was lackluster, the gameplay was near non-existant. The entire game lasted ten minutes. No joke. Ten minutes. With no replayability. Waste of time, waste of money.

I don't even mind the low graphics, but it's very clear after at least 3 tries to play the game, and 10 attempts to get an endurance that doesn't roll below a 3 every time. That it's not worth it. So glad I didn't spend a full dollar on this garbage. Either fix your dice so monsters don't always roll 4 and up, and I barely ever roll a 5 and up ever. Or don't bother making these games.

												So many 'casual' games coming out now that are anything but. Mostly they're just crappy, and thus don't really fit into the category of time-wasters because they're not that fun to play. Others just take up too much time, they're not something you can quickly distract yourself with. Still others might be fun and brief, but they will get tiring quickly.Let's face it, it's hard to develop a game that's very enjoyable in 10-15 minute chunks yet keeps you coming back for more every time.This is just such a game.

												Pure luck.  Just draw a card and roll the dice.  Repeat 53-107 times and hope a bad roll/draw doesn't instantly kill you in the mean time.  If you play on easy or medium difficulty you can slightly alleviate this critical design failure by selecting a loadout, but it doesn't make enough difference that I would call player input relevant.Chainsaw Warrior is one of the few games I've encountered with no redeeming value whatsoever.  It baffles me that this trash has even a single positive review, though given some of the apologies I've seen for bad roguelikes and retro games, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.			"

												Did you own and love the Chainsaw Warrior card game back in the day? Are you a nostalgic person who loves being taken back to the experiences of your childhood/early adulthood? This game might just give you a few hours of fun and spark off some pleasant reminiscences.Are you anyone else? Then you should steer well clear.It's basically a straight port of the card game and frankly makes no sense to me. I grew up in the 80s with Games Workshop as a part of my life, but never played this card game, so didn't know what to expect. Despite being a GW license, the world portrayed here has nothing to do with either the Warhammer of Warhammer 40K universes, so don't expect anything familiar from either. After 20 baffling minutes spent clicking and watching random dice rolls, feeling completely out of the loop as an agent in the progress of what I was seeing onscreen, I decided that other games are far more worthy of my time.

												If you are a fan of the original board game and are looking for a new, faster way to play then BUY THIS. However, for everyone else this game is a pass. I found myself getting bored after a couple of play throughs. In short there is just too much clicking the ""Next"" button and not enough engagement and meaningful decisions.			"

												This game is tough as nails, and you will lose 98% of the time. Bear in mind, this is essentially a card-based version of a roguelike. ""Levels"" are randomly generated by way of deck shuffling, your character by dice rolls, and events by card draws. You have one hour (of in-game time, spent by making moves) to reach the heart of a Warp-infested New York City, before the Army nukes the joint. Simple as that.Much like Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space, this game is meant to be played in short, fifteen-minute ""coffee break"" games. For the small sum of five smackers, you get a huge amount of replayability, if only because you'll need to replay the game umpteen-million times before you win at least once. And, did I mention there are multiple endings?			"

As an actual physical board game this worked as despite the prevelance of luck, you have the tacticle components to play with and you actually get to physically roll the dice yourself. Basically taking all of the physical aspects of the board game away you are essentially left with a game that plays itself while you watch and it just isn't that much fun.			"

												Okay, so this is one of those games that could be good, but isn't due to some ridiculous design choices. I'm going to tear them limb from limb here like the zombies have with me over and over in this silly game.First of all: Chainsaw Warrior is not hard. Lots of people are saying it's ""hard"". It's not. It's a game designed to be stacked against you completely no matter what ""choices"" you make by using fake difficulty created by by how utterly random everything in the ""game"" is.I say ""game"" in quotation marks because everything's completely artbitrary. It doesn't matter what equipment you pick. It doesn't matter whether you flee or fight, or even if you shoot at an enemy or try to melee them. EVERY action requires rolling dice, every time you fight an enemy requires rolling dice from you both.This might make sense were it not for the fact that even your base stats and equipment are, for some utterly nonsensical reason, decided by dice rolls. These stats then impact EVERY dice roll.Instead of creating variation in gameplay, this usually just cripples you or (much more rarely) makes you stupidly overpowered from the get-go. It also makes zero sense. I'm meant to be some sort of ultra-badass cyborg who's humanity's last hope against a hellish invasion...so why do I have a Marksmanship score of ZERO and Hand-To-Hand of 3?This meant I didn't land a single shot with my gun for the whole game and even the lowliest of zombies was almost impossible for me to beat in close combat. In effect, the game was 100% unwinnable before I'd even left the character creation dicerolls. And I'm supposed to be the best soldier in the world? A blind badger is more dangerous than the Chainsaw Warrior.Add to this some utterly BS event cards for a very unenjoyable experience. There is a ""Chasm"" event that pops up and simply tells you that you have to re-do ALL previous encounters (up to FIFTY). WTF?!This is essentially an instant game over, because it means you have to take ""25 minutes"" off your ""60 minute"" timer (each turn is 30 seconds) and fight about 40 monsters all over again. Other events break your vital equipment and basically ruin your game straight up too.And the enemies. My God, the enemy design is just crazy. The lowliest zombies poison you if they hit you even once, and this builds up constantly for the rest of the game. Mutants have massive defence scores and give you radiation damage JUST BY APPEARING (they don't even have to attack you, again WTF) and The Meat Machine enemy is almost impossible to hit AND permanently damages your combat stats every time it hits you.This means the Meat Machine turns up, you miss shooting it, you miss melee (even with good stats), and then it hits you and damages your stats for the rest of the game. Then you try to flee, but can't because of damaged stats, and it hits you again. Then your stats are so low you can't even fight it at all and it literally gets free hits on you. The game ACTUALLY SAYS: ""You cannot fight this enemy, your stats are too low, lol."" INSTANT GAME OVER.These enemies can turn up on any turn. So you can get a Meat Machine turn 1 and lose immediately. Or Turn 60...and lose immediately.Basically imagine you took a dice game, gave it tons of drugs until it was a giggling irrational wreck with a severe sadism complex. Then roll 20 d6 dice simultaneously and subtract all of them from each other for no reason. You then have a game that makes as much sense as Chainsaw Warrior.			"

Hot from the fires of the Games Workshop comes a card & dice game about zombies and chainsaws.  Roll up a random character, equip them and then head out racing against the clock to save New York from 'the darkness' an evil from another dimension.The major issue with this game is that it doesn't provide the player any interesting choices to make during gameplay.  As long as you remember what your character's best stats are you can just keep using that one to one shot most enemies and your movement is predetermined by the shuffle of the cards.  The art is uninspired and repeated constantly as you face the same exact zombie card multiple times in a row.			"

												A fun recreation of the original chainsaw warrior game from the 80s. Most of the gameplay involves throwing dice to kill monsters and drawing cards. I enjoyed this game for the thematic element but obviously it is not for everyone. If you are looking to make meaningful tactical decisions, especially on the harder levels, think again. A lot of it is going to be down to chance. I found this enjoyable but if you are the type of person who complains about RNG, you are really going to hate this game.So go for it if you are a fan of zombie games/dice chuckers, but not for the strategists out there.

												You ever want to play a game where your choices really aren't that important, as compared to luck? One that requires pretty much no heavy thinking? And, to boot, one that pretty closely emulates a real card game experience? If so, then this may well be the game for you. It's an authentic card game, right down to having actual dice roll on the screen, and the actual cards that you flip over. There's not a lot of strategy to it; you make your choices and the dice decides the outcome. I definitely enjoy playing it though, and it's very relaxing to play because of how little control you do have. You're just along for the ride, so why not enjoy it?			"

												A very enjoyable card game that keeps me at the edge of my seat from start to finish.  The game is heavily reliant on roll checks to defeat encounters, though there is a little strategy in the different weapons and equipment items you choose in the very beginning.  Beginning stats are also randomzied via die rolls, so there's no class selection or anything of the kind.  You can make your roll checks easier by choosing the easier difficulty setting, though Darkness (the final boss) will still have his way with you unless you're very lucky.  I think he could be made easier on the ""easy"" difficulty setting, personally.  All in all, worth the price (especially if you get the game during a sale as I did).

												I've played a few Games Workshop games, but this title was before my time. Read the store page to discover the backstory to the game, though it's basically Escape From New York with zombies.The majority of the gameplay is die-rolling (it's nice to know my luck sucks as hard rolling virtually), however there are opportunities to risk/reward weapons, items, maximize attributes and to factor in how far along the player is in the run.The UI is very easy to understand; the art on the cards is nice and stylized -- I cannot compare to the accuracy or faithfulness to the original gameand -- and the difficulty is delightfully brutal.Still, play this game on Hard (also called 'Classic', which I assume is how the original was). Think of it like FTL: the joy is struggling to get to the finish line, dying an endless amount of times and one day feeling the absolute high of beating the final boss.			"

Unfortunately it appears that this card game sucks.95% of your game is determined when you create your character and if you don't have maximized stats then you will need to be very lucky to win, even on the normal difficulty.  Most of the encounters are boring and there isn't really much in the way of decisions to make one you pick your gear at the beginning.  Almost all of the enemies are so weak as to not need a dice roll and then the final boss is so overpowered you'll need to be rolling 10+ on the dice to do any damage to it.  I was so bored after several games that I couldn't be bothered playing through it enough times to beat the final boss by sheer luck and get the achievement for it.  The game has some style and potential but the actual game mechanics ruin it.  If you've somehow played the card game and enjoyed it then I am sure you will enjoy this version of it.  I've played worse games but it gets a solid thunmbs down from me.  Maybe a 3 out of 10 for style.			"

												I've played a few Games Workshop games, but this title was before my time. Read the store page to discover the backstory to the game, though it's basically Escape From New York with zombies.The majority of the gameplay is die-rolling (it's nice to know my luck sucks as hard rolling virtually), however there are opportunities to risk/reward weapons, items, maximize attributes and to factor in how far along the player is in the run.The UI is very easy to understand; the art on the cards is nice and stylized -- I cannot compare to the accuracy or faithfulness to the original gameand -- and the difficulty is delightfully brutal.Still, play this game on Hard (also called 'Classic', which I assume is how the original was). Think of it like FTL: the joy is struggling to get to the finish line, dying an endless amount of times and one day feeling the absolute high of beating the final boss.			"

												I loved this game as a Student in the lates 80s, finally got my own copy in the early 2000s from Hay on Wye. I love this version a perfect adaption of the original boardgame which has the bonus that you don't have to pack up the bits or lose them.			"

												I haven't played the original game so I can't comment on comparison to it. That being said, this game is pretty fun for a 15 minute solo adventure. I was a bit disappointed with enemy variety. I think that while rolling dice for stat creation is acceptable, character creation could be much better. I would've also liked to see more variety in the amount of actions you can perform other than almost exclusivley shoot and hand to hand combat on every card. I bought on sale at 1.99 and I think thats about the right price for this small, mildly entertaining die-rolling fest.			"

												Cool concept and was slightly fun, until I got the card where the building collapses. When this happens, you draw 5 cards in a row and then you have to restart your current deck. This can almost guarantee you losing, as you have to play through 1 deck of 54 cards before you get to the 2nd deck where you can kill the boss and win. Each card removes time off the clock. I had the building card come up twice on the first deck, essentially guaranteeing that I lost my game.			"

												Super old-school, solo card game cyber-mutant-apocalyptic-zombie action. I thought this idea had never existed before. And here it is. I had thought of this solo card game concept in a zombie game I designed back in 2004-2005...and now, looking at the background for this game and the game mechanics - I know I wasn't inventing the wheel LOL. This is not a game of super graphics and 3D and all those shiny things that most people seek in a game. This is a game for those old-school board game fans that enjoy imagination, game concepts and dices! I totally loved this game and will definitely use this as base to continue my work on my solo-card game designs. Totally worth the money.			"

												You ever want to play a game where your choices really aren't that important, as compared to luck? One that requires pretty much no heavy thinking? And, to boot, one that pretty closely emulates a real card game experience? If so, then this may well be the game for you. It's an authentic card game, right down to having actual dice roll on the screen, and the actual cards that you flip over. There's not a lot of strategy to it; you make your choices and the dice decides the outcome. I definitely enjoy playing it though, and it's very relaxing to play because of how little control you do have. You're just along for the ride, so why not enjoy it?			"

If you're buying it for that, it's no easy feat to kill The Darkness 25 times or complete hard mode. But that feeling of satisfaction when you score perfect in this game is a lot like achieving multiple ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Also, the cards are nice.This game is worth the pain and suffering.			"

												A fun enough game to kill 10 - 15 minutes. Chainsaw Warrior is a gambleing game simmular to FTL except luck is a larger factor. Chariter generation and gameplay are done with dice rolls. Bad rolls won't ruin the game, and good rolls dont garentee a win. Overall it's good enough for $5.			"

												A very enjoyable card game that keeps me at the edge of my seat from start to finish.  The game is heavily reliant on roll checks to defeat encounters, though there is a little strategy in the different weapons and equipment items you choose in the very beginning.  Beginning stats are also randomzied via die rolls, so there's no class selection or anything of the kind.  You can make your roll checks easier by choosing the easier difficulty setting, though Darkness (the final boss) will still have his way with you unless you're very lucky.  I think he could be made easier on the ""easy"" difficulty setting, personally.  All in all, worth the price (especially if you get the game during a sale as I did).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_q9gciZqzQ "

												An interesting game to be sure, although not worth a great expenditure. I would recommend purchasing it on sale, despite the low price tag.So, this game is basically a precursor to Warhammer 40,000. Some sort of Warp portal has opened up in a city and you have to send your character, Chainsaw Warrior, to go down there and seal it back up. It is a relatively faithful replication of the original boardgame, to the point of using the same dice and cards.The game holds up pretty well to the original standard, although one would expect for it to become something...more, for a rerelease of an older game. Like optional expansions or something. Still, the game does what it advertises, and isn't that the most important thing.In terms of gameplay, it can be very fun, although the 'standard' difficulty can be frustratingly hard to beat, based on luck as it is. I do not feel the game has much in the way of replay value, however, and for me that is a pretty big negative. If it were not so inexpensive I would not recommend it at all. As it stands, I give this old school boardgame-turned-CRPG a 6/10. Worthwhile, not great.(Overall 6/10, Story 6/10, Gameplay 7/10, Graphics 5/10, Sound 7/10, Replayability 4/10)			"

												A fun little game if you are looking for something to amuse yourself without an intense commitment of energy. It may sound strange, but this game actually reminds me a lot of solitaire. It's a one player card (and dice) game whose play is highly random. Like solitaire, you have to accept the randomness and the fact that not all game will be winnable. Like solitaire, a game could be quick, or if you are doing well you might spend quite a few minutes. Like solitaire, most of the decisions and strategy are obvious, but on occasion you have to make an important decision.Pros:+ Enjoyable, quick game that doesn't require too much effort or attention+ Satisfying to win because of the high difficultyCons:- Some people might be turned off by the high amount of randomness in the game. Don't expect every game to be winnable.- A lot of the game is just clicking for dice rolls. To some extent the game plays itself. Don't expect an overly active experience. This is more of a game where you sit back and watch and just make a few decisions.- UI doesn't give you all the info you need at times. Sometimes it's hard to see how the game is calculating the outcome of events, and it's hard to make decisions when you don't have all the info, especially when you are first starting.(Note: all these pros and cons remind me of solitaire)			"

If you have never played the original then you are in for nice treat.  Playing is all about the dice roll so it is similar to a rougelike, and each time you play it will be a different experience.

If you don't like RNG, old board/GW games, 2000AD kind of stuff or solitaire type games then I can't recommend it.I however love all that! Its 100% faithful to the original and so completely luck based but I find it a lot of fun. If you are into any of the above I say it is cheap enough to be worth a go (it is also super cheap in the humble GW sale atm, priced at £1.60 rather than £4).The developers have also announced a sequel/DLC that will take advantage of the ""digital"" format. So I expect more interactive options/choices. Sounds great!			"

												A fun recreation of the original chainsaw warrior game from the 80s. Most of the gameplay involves throwing dice to kill monsters and drawing cards. I enjoyed this game for the thematic element but obviously it is not for everyone. If you are looking to make meaningful tactical decisions, especially on the harder levels, think again. A lot of it is going to be down to chance. I found this enjoyable but if you are the type of person who complains about RNG, you are really going to hate this game.So go for it if you are a fan of zombie games/dice chuckers, but not for the strategists out there.

												This is a fun but ultimately pointless random card game.This is an adaptation of the original Chainsaw Warrior game.Pros:- tiny bit of atmosphere- titular chainsaw is a very useful itemCons:- boring after first 30 minutes- repetitive- there are a lot of items but if you want to win you need to pick 5-6 core items - if character creation rolls are against you it's better to start over again as the game may just be lost when playing a weak character- relieance on some items is too great - e.g. rope launcher is a key item if you don't have a climbing skill, as without it you'll lose much time in some casesOverall I can't recommend this game even to hardcore players. It's better to take out your original game if you still have it. "

												I got the game through Humble Bundle, so I did not pay the full price, but I still consider it well worth 5 USD. The game is hard, unforgiving and to some extend you throw yourself at the mercy of the RNG Gods, but with that being said, I have completed the game on all three difficulties in only 4 hours. Admittedly, I was savescumming my way through the hardest difficulty, but easy and normal can be overcome without too much of a fuzz, if you put some thought into you items selections and perhaps reroll your character once or twice. There are times where you will find yourself unequipped to handle a cave-in or an unpassable chasm, but losing is part of the game.For some reason, I love tormenting myself with these sorts of games, but if you want a more skill-based experience, you should try the Chainsaw Warrior: Lords of the Night. They improved upon a lot of things – especially the influence the player directly has on the game. Overall, I would say this game is 50/50 on luck and skill with most of the skill being in foresight (choice of equipment) and trial and error (you learn what to fear and how to avoid it). The only real issue I have is with a feature you are almost always forced to use against the endgame boss who can only be killed with a special weapon (or an implosion vest which – as a pretty cool feature – ends the game in a draw). You get one shot and after that you get some ‘lucky shots’ and those are just annoying. Basically, you roll a die and depending on what you roll, something will happen. You will only win, if you roll a six, but rolling anything else will either waste the shot or something else, like, shooting yourself. Granted, there are things you can do to improve these odds (like mounting a scope on your weapon), but losing the game because your supposedly badass character shot himself in the foot, is a little... disappointing. Still, the game is far from unbeatable.			"
