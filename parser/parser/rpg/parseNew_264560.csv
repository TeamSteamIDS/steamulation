												A pretty funny, deliberately nostalgic point-and-click RPG. Fans who grew up with the genre will surely feel a warm sensation as they play through this adventure.			"

												For medical reasons I am EXCLUSIVELY a point & click gamer. There is nothing wrong with point & click games, the stories are amazing, but I sometimes I miss the range of RPG games & this game gave it back to me.Quest for Infamy is the silliest game I've played in a while & the sarcasm reminds me so much of the point & click games of my childhood. You're going to love it.			"

												Let me summarise what I've seen so far and maybe that will help you decide whether to buy this game for 20 dollars or not.First of all, if you are a fan of Quest for Glory series, you WILL enjoy this game - it has that same feeling to it. The art style does a great job at attempting to stay true to the classics and the music (at least for me) fits in the game perfectly. Regarding animations, this game succeeds with them and even the gory parts of the game have turned out good. As for the voice-acting, in general they've done a decent job with it and there are very minor flaws which probably won't even bother you. I've only encountered one monster but the fighting system is very simple and easy to learn (basically it's like in QfG, you hack, slash, stab or something of the sort). And last but not least, the game has a good amount of humour which you will witness here and there. So in conclusion, aside from very small details regarding voice-acting, I would call this a perfect game. I understand 20 dollars is expensive for some people, but think of it this way - it's thrice or more times cheaper than your usual triple-A title on launch, so I would take it as a bargain if I were in your shoes, deciding. :)EDIT: Alright, I've completed the game and I have to say that this game is TOTALLY worth the 20 dollars. It is very catchy, the world is just HUGE and the overall story is great. It's nice that, as others have also said, in the end you get to be a hero too as a perk. In any case, if you are a fan of good old Sierra games, you won't regret buying this game.			"

												I'm not good at writing reviews, so I'm gonna write a list because it's easier.Good:- Voice acting. Characters like Roehm, Kit and Rayford sound great.- Puzzle design. Sometimes I did some clever things.- 320x240. It's a pretty neat resolution. A lot of the artwork looks great, especially the backgrounds.- Roehm. I like that he's got more personality and attitude. Similar games tend to have a main character with the personality of an apple. I'm not that fond of apples.- That one guy wearing the clothing of the hero from Hero's Quest. He made me giggle.- A lot of the writing is great.Bad:- Voice acting. Sometimes there's reverb, sometimes it's muffled, sometimes the accents makes no sense, and sometimes the voice actor honestly isn't good at acting at all. Overall, I like the voice acting, but it's all over the place.- Puzzle design. Most of the puzzles are fine, but it's easy to do puzzles in the opposite order, and it's especially frustrating when you're denied to do the solution because you haven't triggered an event elsewhere which is an arbitrary requirement. There's also a few puzzles where logical actions not only fail, but give you a generic ""Can't do that.""- 320x240. I like the graphics, but with the exception of the character sprites a lot of it looks like it was scaled way down. It would have been interesting to see it go for a higher res look.- The premise of being a bad guy is neat, but you're not really much of a bad guy. You fight bandits, help out people, and well, have a bit of a potty mouth. There's a ton of wasted potential.- Bugs, oh so many bugs. Background objects rendering in front of character. Clicking on edge of screen to move to next screen can be a surprisingly large challenge, especially in windowed mode. Some scripts can get very confused if you do things in an unexpected order. And I was able to find a way to skip a sizable portion of the game because I like exploring too much.- The combat is kinda dreadfully boring. But I'm willing to excuse the game for it as the combat is dreadfully boring in every game of this subgenre.If Steam supported horizontal thumbs up, I would probably lean more towards that. People who eat up adventure games for breakfast will enjoy this, but others might just get frustrated. I am definitely thinking a sequel has great potential though.			"

												Quest for Infamy is a wonderful homage to the glory days of Sierra On-Line, particularly the Quest for Glory series. The people at Infamous Quests don't disappoint in giving us a humorous look into the seedy underbelly of the world of Lonaria. After escaping from the clutches of a baron to the east, Roehm hitches a ride to the Valley of Krasna as he flees toward the north. Volksville, Tyr, and the surrounding countryside is filled with unique and interesting people that will either help or hinder your progress to save your hide. Over two years in development, and lots of blood sweat and tears later, the experience shows just how passionate the development team has been in bringing their dream to life. If you're looking for an adventure experience that'll tickle both your nostalgic as well as your funny bone, then look no further than this title. I promise you won't be disappointed.			"

												Being an avid adult gamer, and actually KNOWING the creators of the Quest For Glory series of games, and speaking as a game developer myself (Pixel Piracy), I can honestly say that this game is akin to booting up my old pentium I and playing Quest for Glory again.It hits all the notes, and then some, it goes so far out of it's way to provide an undistilled feeling of nostalgia, while being completely fresh and true to itself as it's own game that I can only give my most sincere thanks to the development team behind it.I have spent years waiting for an adventure game as unique as Quest For Glory to crop up again, and the wait is now over. This game, to me, is Quest for Glory V (the 3d weird one they came out with at the end of the nineties DOES NOT count.), and yes I know it's a different studio, but this spiritual successor is THAT empowering, without lacking originality, that it deserves it.KUDOS!

												Worth every penny.  I would absolutely reccomend this game if you like point-and-click adventure games.  They practically distilled the essence of yesteryear's games, and gave you the option to be the crude, lewd, shyster, anti-hero that you have always wanted to be.Just in case you want to see what Im talking about:

												A great point-and-click adventure / RPG hybrid in the tradition of Sierra's Quest for Glory classics. Great attention to detail with every background tidbit clickable and having voiced-over narrator comments. Many colorful characters. Voice work could be better but it's there and it gets the job done, so no real complaints.Solid thumbs up if you remember the old classics fondly.			"

												Quest for Infamy has the forest setting of Quest for Glory I: So You Want To Be A Hero.Its got the varied class-specific sidequests of Quest for Glory 2: Trial By Fire. It has the vast scope (over 200 hand-drawn areas!) of Quest for Glory 3: Wages of War.Part of the plot concerns the fate of the cursed Killington family, an eldritch tale right out of Quest for Glory 4: Shadows of Darkness.And the massive port city of Tyr feels a lot like Silmaria from Quest for Glory 5: Dragon Fire.In short, if you liked Quest for Glory, you will REALLY like this game. Play it for the nostalgia alone.			"

												As a big fan of the old Sierra classics from the 90s I knew I had to own this the minute I saw it on Steam.It's all there: the cheesy but funny jokes, the oldschool style and a real challenge. This isnt an easy game, not as easy as most adventure games released nowadays (but also not as hard as for instance Quest for Glory). It reminded me most of Hero's Quest/Conquest of Camelot. Except the maincharacter isnt a very nice person, he's quite  egocentric. Which is nice for a change, I also like his dark humour ;). Its mostly adventuring with a little fighting. This is an adult themed game. There's killing and cursing. I havent seen any sex or nudity yet, but there are hints it might be possible (maincharacter is a ladies man ;) ). Dont expect a Leisure Suite Larry though.All text has voice actors. Some of them are brilliant, some of them, well, are not. A lot of cheesy overacting, I love it. Graphics are... retro. Awesome.System requirements? a pc will doIf you have fond memories of the old Sierra games and youre looking for a challenge you'll love this. If youre new to adventure games  this probably isnt a game for you. If you dont like the retro style dont buy this. One thing though, the price seems high. Especially for a retro game. But dont forget you'll have many hours of fun playing this, and for me every euro I spent on it is worth it. One of those games I'm convinced I will finish eventually. "

												Pros-Great music-Quest for Glory (RPG/Adventure) style of gameplay with some modern adjustments. You get a notifier when your skills level up, for instance.-Gorgeous pixel art-Some really funny lines-Good homages to the classics-Good sense of progression with stats/loot from enemies. That good RPG feel where you can tell you're getting stronger.-Sensible puzzles. Make you think, but no absurd 'How could anyone guess *that*?' moments. Good clues built in to dialogue with people to help you think your way through.-Balanced difficulty for combatCons-Odd pacing, Act II/III don't have as much meat as Act I. Minor quibble. Still a meaty game.-Voice acting could be hit or miss. Funny lines would sometimes be delivered in ways that made the joke less effective-Fan service in female designs was overkill. I'm usually fine with it, and to a certain degree with your character it makes sense. But it was laid on a little too thick. Rohem needed a few more Larry Laffer style cases where his ego gets pricked a bit.9/10, if I had to give it a number. Pick it up!			"

												Overall, it is an awesome nod to the classic point-and-click adventure games. For myself, the game deserves a 10/10. Love the Easter Eggs with reference to popular culture as well as to classic games: the Weeping Angel reference in the graveyard was just too funny, wonder if there is a way to make it a secret bad end if you keep looking at it?It is kind of sad that you can't do mixed classes (since I used to love making a magic wielding thieft in Quest for Glory), but the game compensates for it by making class specific quests  and story instead, which makes the gameplay interesting in its own way. Let's not forget to mention, the hint of a sequel, too! Now if only the achievements and minor bugs could be fixed when the patch is out.....			"

												You wait sixteen years for a new game that picks up where the Quest of Glory series left off. Suddenly there's Quest for Infamy. Quest for Infamy will look and feel familiar to anyone who experienced those glory days of adventure gaming – frustration and all. Quest for Infamy is an ambitious, often entertaining homage that has all the ingredients for success, but the overall experience is impaired by uneven humour and lacklustre combat. Luckily I won't have to wait another sixteen years for a sequal of this game. :)			"

												Full disclosure, I tossed a couple of coins at Infamous Quests during the Kickstarter for this game. That said, I could have doubled my pledge and it wouldn't be enough to cover the fun I am having playing this wonderful send up of Sierra's ""Quest for Glory"" series. The hero, William Roehm isn't quite as squeeky clean as he could be. Oh sure, he isn't outright evil but he knows how to take care of himself and if that means stepping on a few toes in the process, well, so be it. The nods to classic games are everywhere, the humor keeps the mood light, the puzzles are tough enough to keep you engaged (there are walkthroughs galore including on the publisher's (Phoenix Online) website), the old style graphics are fun, the combat is pretty solid and other than a few goofy bugs (text doesn't line up with the voice over and occasional difficulty getting between screens) this is a solid game. If you have any love for the Adventure/RPG hybrids, this game is for you.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Quest For Infamy 

			Views: 514		

			Quest For Infamy is a spiritual successor to the older games of days long past such as Quest For Glory. The game is a point and click, open world, combat rolled adventure RPG.		

	Quest for Infamy is a point and click, open world adventure RPG; a spiritual successor to Quest for Glory. This game easily has one of the best musical soundtracksI have heard; it syncs perfectly step for step for the entire adventure, and variesaccording to what you do and how you play. The voice acting is professional, and thegame offers the option to turning it on or off, and having subtitles with or withoutthe voice. There is a comic/ satirical undertone throughout the game, making it oneof the funniest point and click adventures I have played.	You have the option to play as a warrior, mage, or a rogue. The story incorporatesyour choice throughout the game. The warrior is a solid character to play if youare new to this style of game. The rogue unfortunately has limitations to what they are capable of doing, such as not being able to pick all the locks even though you have 100% lock picking, and the stealth element that prevents enemies from spawning inany area you go to, instead of stealthing around enemies. The mage, who relies on spells, is actually the strongest in the game. The spells add a level of depthand make the mage feel well rounded. 	The level design of the game is a true open world, where you have the optionto travel all over the map. There are also puzzles that are tied into the open world,which adds a level of depth. Some things did take away a bit from the old school feeling of games such as Quest for Glory in that they did present a map for certain more confusingareas, instead of having the player write out and figure out how to get through thoseareas. If anything, I found that the game opens up too soon, making it more difficultto understand or follow the main story, as you can easily get bogged down by side quests or errands. This is only in the first chapter however; it focuses and progressesvery well in the second and third chapters. The game also offers a day and night cycle,which adds a huge level of depth by what creatures come out during what point of day,and how you can complete certain objectives giving it a greater feel and personalty. 	Although you do get tips and clues, the game does not hold your hand and leadyou to each step, which is nice to see. The usage of items in the game made sense and it was up to the player to figure out what was needed and where from the sea of items in the game. The story was entertaining, and unlike many of the current games out, I was really blown away by the ending. This game is highly recommended.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												As an old fan of Quest for Glory and the point and click adventure series in general, I very much loved this game.Quest for Infamy follows the adventures of Roehm.  Certainly no hero, Roehm is a roguish fellow, although he's not a complete villain either.The game is quite huge in terms of places to visit and things to do.  The artwork for the game is well-drawn and it has an entertaining story with an interesting cast of characters.  It also offers a lot of replayability in that one can pick from a Thief, Brigand or Sorcerer.  While Thieves can sneak into houses the Brigands can engage in caravan attack missions and Mages can collect spell components and learn new spells.  More than just changes to the combat system, each class has its own unique storylines and its own way of dealing with problems.  For instance, while a thief may sneak past 3 unruly hunters using the thief tunnels the Brigand can simply fight them off while the Mage can cast a fear spell that sends them running in terror.  Each class has unique missions to accomplish and can befriend different casts of characters to learn more about the world around them and those who populate it.The game's story itself is quite good and has a very dark, gothic style to it as well as mischievous and perverted sense of humor.  The game functions well as a loving tribute/parody to Quest for glory and the adventure/fantasy genre in general.  Longtime Sierra fans of olde will appreciate many of the Easter Eggs hidden throughout the game thought it's completely unnecessary to be an oldschool Sieera fan to enjoy the game in general.  The game also features very good voice-acting and narration to accompany the story.There are some complex puzzles to the game that can be quite tricky and confusing though, but it's well worth the effort to make your way past them and find out what happens next.  The focus of the game is much more on adventuring and solving puzzles and soaking in the fun than on combat, so pure-adrenaline junkies should probably stick to Skyrim.  If you're easily offended and want something more PG you should probably stick with Quest for Glory instead.Overall I'd give it a 9/10 and I do hope it has a sequel someday. :)			"

												A love-letter to Quest for Glory that delivers in every aspect.The guys at Infamous Quests got it right with this game. It is reminiscent of the good old games without feeling the need to recite them word for word. Beautiful hand-drawn backgrounds and character portraits, an interesting, funny story with memorable characters and true old-school mechanics. I am especially impressed by the feeling of epic scale and freedom in the vast lands of Quest for Infamy. I would however love if the developers could make the RPG elements more relevant to the game play. I also think it would be a great addition to include a female character option for the main protagonist in the next game.Overall the feeling of interaction in such a grand world that lets me choose what to do next combined with a tounge-in-cheek story that never feels ridiculous sent me on an unforgettable adventure that fills my heart with joy! Thank you Infamous Quests.			"

												A few techniculties here and there at the begining didn't stand in the way of this good game. I really like the story. I've just finished as the rouge class and I have to say that based on the ending, I HOPE THERE'S a sequel! It seems like there's a lot more game that they could create and hopefully with getting their bearings with the first game, can release a double stuffed sequel. If you're a fan of the old Sierra Adventure games then this game gives the olde skool style a modern lift. Voice acting is pretty good and feels solid most everywhere. FANS OF THE Ben Jordan/Grundaslav games check this out too, as I am certain that the art style of this game would appeal to your tastes.The Linux port is also much appreciated			"

												Let me open with a quick summation: Quest for Infamy is a great game!Now, for those of you who like a bit more detail, there's certainly more information to share. To begin with the game is very reminiscent of the classic adventure games of the past. The fact that QFI draws inspiration from the Quest for Glory series is made obvious, not only by the name, but by the graphics, music, sound effects, and even characters. It is the finest example of this type of game I've played since QFG IV was released.As not all of you may be familiar with these type of adventure games, I'll give you some details on game play. The core game is centered around exploring a fantasy world filled with memorable (and humorous) characters, finding out what their problems are, and helping them solve them. In Quest for Infamy you take on the role of a character who is, in essence, a self-centered jerk. However, as the player you have a fair amount of control over just how much of a jerk and just how self-motivated you actually are. In my case, for instance, Roehm was merely a smart mouth with a heart of gold deep down. Of course, that's all down to personal preference. It's just as easy (or easier) to be a genuine scum bag that goes around stealing or destroying everything he can.Whatever Roehm's background motivations may be, creative problem solving is a major part of the game. A great deal of moving the game forward is about finding the right item to use in the right place at the right time. In similar games of yesteryears this could often lead to frustration. Quest for Infamy, however, manages to remove this frustration almost completely by leaving plenty of clues around for the player to follow up. If you're ever stuck, there's no need to bang your head against the same brick wall for hours at a time. You can simply pull on another thread until you have a breakthrough.Another aspect of the game is combat. Although it's true that the system is fairly simple, it's also very enjoyable. Being able to bash bad-guys and loot their corpses adds a real element. The fact that it's simple (and even easy) doesn't take anything away from the game. Combat isn't the focus of Quest for Infamy, it's merely one of it's many enjoyable facets.I feel I should also mention the voice acting. In most cases it was very good and all of it added to the experience. In all honesty, some of the microphone work could have been better. However, considering the production budget of the game, the job was very well done. I feel certain that the success of this first game (in what I sincerely hope will be a series) will lead to even higher production quality in future.The music fits the game perfectly and the composer deserves hearty congratulations. I actually found myself humming some of the tunes absentmindedly. In my book that's a sign of a quality musical score.My one complaint is about the language in the game. Although it's certainly not as bad as most modern television shows there are a number of curse words throughout. In my opinion there was no need for that. The writing is excellent and the humor often brilliant. I personally see curse words as a comedic crutch. It's one I feel QFI didn't need.All in all, I feel that Quest for Infamy is an excellent buy. I'm hoping to soon hear news of a sequel in the works. I missed the Kickstarter campaign for the first game. I certainly don't want to miss a second one.			"

												I recomend this game for anyone that enjoys the point-and-click adventure genre. It is well made and feels polished. The humor in the game has just the right amount of irreverancy and self-awareness to make it fun without seeming to be forced. All in all, well done.			"

												A great throwback to the old days of Sierra point n clicks. If you've ever played Quest for Glory or Kings Quest, you'll feel right at home with the gameplay. The fact that your character this time around is a rogue, rather than your typical do-gooder hero, adds a lot of flavor to the game and the dialogue had me laughing all the way through. The game also offers a little bit of replay value, which is unusual for the genre, by letting you play through as 3 different classes. The only real flaws the game has are that it can be a little buggy at time, although the devs seem to be pretty good about addressing there, and there tends to be a lot of clutter in your inventory, which is a small peeve of mine in this kind of game. These problems, however, are pretty small in the long run and I would not hesitate to reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys old-school point n clicks.			"

												A bunch of young folk's interpretation of the medieval era. Absolutely amazing, I god damn hate point click adventure games but even I have to admit that these developers are talented. The puzzles are logical, aka they're not complete nonsense and ANYONE can complete them I think. The devs are a bunch of sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but that's what gives this game so much charm. Throughout the game I've been laughing. Debauchery, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, taverns, great music, all good fun. The game deserves more recognition than it's getting. There's only 75 reviews and it's clear the devs poured their hearts into this game.			"

												Heroine Quest does everything this game does, better, for free.In terms of quality, it feels as though this is the free game while Heroine's Quest is what people should be paying for.It's not a terrible homage to QFG, just overtly bland, never really getting into the Infamy angle.It's also filled with terrible British humor by people who love their Red Dwarf and Monty Python, but never got what a huge portion of what made those influential was originality.Also, my impressions.

												This game.  I don't even know where to begin.Playing this game is like walking down the street and seeing that beautiful girl you dated 10-15 years ago walking towards you.  You feel older, more experienced, more up to the task.  She still looks exactly as gorgeous then as she did now.  Everything feels so familiar.  You two talk, you remember some of your old jokes, but you're both older now, so some of the jokes are a bit more dirty.  You're finally able to do so many of the things you've wanted to do for years.Of course, I'm talking about the girl being the 1991 VGA remake of Sierra's 'Quest for Glory: So You Want To Be a Hero?'  The game play and feel of this game is VERY much like the old QFG games.  You need to pay attention.  Hell, even take notes.  Right now I'm stuck on a part because I refuse to turn to google to figure it out.  And it's so much more fun because of that.  If your idea of a good time is to just follow an arrow to your next objective and have the game hold your hand all the way though, this isn't the game for you.  Sorry.  Go play skyrim or something.  Otherwise, buy this game.  Now.  Why are you still reading this?  Scroll up and hit 'Add to cart.'			"

In fact, playing fallout4 at same time as this game, and find myself much more compelled to finish this game. I really think that this game would be very enjoyable to anyone, and not just folks who like indie and retro games. Seriously, give this one a good go, I strongly recommend it.

												Good stuff guys.At times I forgot it was indie. I was hooked until I was finished, reminded me of when I first got a hold of So You Want to Be a Hero.Pros: Good puzzles, logical solutions, great retro graphics, music and a story that kept me interested. I can rememeber all the groups, locations and whatnot so that is saying something. Too often adventure games are boring, not this one. Roehm espically - was nice to play a character with attitude vs a blank slate.Cons: Battle system was bad (QFG2 remake for how it should be done?), Stats were useless beyond clicking a few dozen times, job path didn't mean much, no matter what you must fight, etcAll in all if you like adventure games or quest for glory I suggest this game. Flawed or not it was fun, funny and worth it. Bring on Infamy 2!			"

												Fantastic little game in the vein of Quest for Glory 4.  Voice acting is a little uneven at times with some characters sounding passable and others of such low quality it brings to mind the old cd version of King's Quest V (where you could hear the echo in the room all the recording was done in).  Of course, I don't play these types of games to hear fancy voicework and look at pretty graphics (although graphics-wise the background artists did a fantastic job with the vast majority of the screens).I will definitely be checking out future games in the series (I see there is a prologue and a couple other games in the works in the same world but different characters) and likely will do a playthrough with the Brigand and Sorceror classes just to see alternate content.

												Love this throwback to 'Quest for Glory', one of my favorite games as a kid. It's got a lot of the great elements from the series (particularly my favorite 'so you want to be a hero?'). The story is fun and the gameplay solves a lot of the bugs from the Glory series. The additional character dev and scripting is a nice, slightly corny touch :). My main criticism is that the game lacks a lot of the depth/length for the genre. It's fun and has replay value, but there are not as many options and the track is a bit too fixed for my taste. I still enjoyed it and would recommend getting it on sale for a good time.

												To read the full review head over to: http://www.apixelatedview.com/quest-infamy-review/Many commonalities fondly recall the adventure era of PC gaming, back when purchasing a game didn’t mean beating it and there were no walkthroughs to guide you into solving the cryptic puzzles. At that time PC adventure games, unlike their console counterparts, didn’t require skill or reflexes, but rather patience, wit and persistence. They presented the player with gripping stories or humorous situations and each problem in the game was solvable only by the sharpest of thinkers. Long has since that age been forgotten by most, but die hard fans refuse to move on from the fascinating genre. Luckily enough, some developers are just as reminiscent of the time and are more than ready to bring the nostalgia back, and with crowd-funding options like Kickstarter, these games are now becoming a reality. One such game is Quest for Infamy, a point-and-click adventure which raised over $60,000 and gave hope to adventuresome fanatics everywhere. Does the game manage to bring you back to that golden age of the 90′s, or does it fall flat?Quest for Infamy‘s gameplay stays largely the same but refines the already familiar points and introduces new modern mechanics to make an even more enticing experience. After escaping an angry baron, the cynical protagonist, Roehm, lands in an alien world where choosing whose side he’s on and what he’ll do falls upon the player. The game largely bases its likability on the humorous dialogues and situations Roehm gets himself in, with the lack of point and direction in the start only making the situation even more ridiculous. While the game soon does get a goal and a fantastically well written plot as mysteries arise all around you, the world moves and progresses unrelated to what the player does, making it seem alive and moving. However this isn’t only a point-and-click adventure game as it tries to combine certain RPG elements in the already established core. Some of these work to immerse you further in the plot while some of them feel tedious and tacked on. Having to eat, sleep and manage your money as time moves on, for instance, make it fairly challenging to go out at night, but they do well in making you feel like you are a part of the game world, something not a lot of games excel in. Sadly the combat is simply abysmal, lacking any kind of depth or ingenuity.The world itself is beautifully made, every background flawlessly representing the diverse atmospheres and locations. The nostalgic art-style coupled with the small resolution and mandatory windowed mode do well in capturing that classical adventure climate, and are sure to bring any avid player back to that special age of gaming. From the lush forests to the medieval towns, this fairy-tale like world never ceases to amaze, and the events that periodically occur throughout the game make it feel alive.This is also coupled with an excellent soundtrack that fits just as well as the visuals and manages to pull off every atmosphere impeccably well. And since there’s an insurmountably large amount of them, at no point will they get old so you will oft have a hard time leaving the screen you’re on simply because of the terrific tune playing in the background. The sound design further proves to be well made with the voice acting, speeding up the classical process of having to read every dialogue line. While the voice acting is cheesy for the most part, this is intentional and when the game gets serious the cast does a good job in doing so as well. Not to mention each character has their own personal actor behind them making the world even more immersing than it already is. Special props need to be given to the sarcastic narrator who delivers each line as humorously and condescendingly as possible, giving the entire game more personality.Technicalities aside, this is still largely a point-and-click adventure game, and since the world is foreign to both you and Roehm, exploring it and learning about it can be satisfying. In fact the story and setting are one and the same, building atop one another as you progress – it’s very open-ended structure. There’s also a lack of hand holding as you can do as little or as much as you want in this stunningly realistic world, and this allows you to organically learn about the environment as opposed to just giving you info, making every conclusion gratifying. You will have to write down notes as you study the magnificent structures and learn about the intriguing and cheerful places you visit, whether it’s by finding items or conversing with the characters. The inclusion of a journal could have made this game a lot easier though, as some of the information you gain is easily forgotten. Since the game is far from linear, you can choose which characters to side with and how to go about playing the many sub-plots and quests that litter the game, which blend perfectly with both the world and setting. Not one person will have the same experience as every choice impacts the plot and tailors the rest of what will happen.Since the game does feature such a vast and open world with varied locations and atmospheres, it becomes harder and harder to actually solve the presented problems. The usual puzzle structure is just as difficult to figure out as any of the games of yore, meaning you won’t be able to simply solve a puzzle by going from point A to point B, but will mostly likely have to run across points A, B, C and D just to get a piece of the puzzle solved, made even harder by the enclave of distractions and side quests which all offer more opportunities for new adventures and loot. And since there’s always only a slight hint and/or lead as to what you might have to do, actually drawing conclusions and managing to solve the puzzles is acutely enjoyable. The puzzles are focused more on exploration, dialogue and most importantly experimentation and then drawing conclusion from the information that you have rather than the usual mini games, even though these aren’t lacking either. And since you’ll usually prematurely get the items you require, seeing how the seemingly random trinkets fit into the story never fails to amuse.Exploration sadly isn’t all rainbows and flowers, as your clicks have to be extraordinarily accurate to move on to the next screen and Roehm may sometimes glitch out while you’re trying to get him to do something. Quest for Infamy isn’t lacking in problems, and it sometimes doesn’t even attempt to fix a lot of the ones the games of yore held, but it also manages to wholly bring you back into the nostalgic world of adventure games with captivating plots and witty dialogue. The large and diverse world feels alive as the player can decide how much or how little he wants to get involved with the unique characters and intriguing sub plots. The setting and story build on top of one another to create an unforgettable and believable experience and they both immerse you in the overall silliness of the quirky story. And while there are some design flaws, namely the awful combat system, pointless grinding and awkward controls, some of the layered puzzles, beautiful locations and enticing events will surely draw you in and lead to satisfying conclusions. Whether you’re experimenting with items or organically learning about the world, the game is sure to draw you in. Just don’t be fooled, this isn’t a game made for people with short attention spans and a desire to let off steam, this is a sophisticated game that makes you think and perhaps makes you laugh here and there. Quest for Infamy‘s wittiness is undeniable and it’s unique and organic flow of gameplay and story will leave even the veterans of this genre scratching their heads, trying to figure out some of the complex puzzles and mysteries in the hours of fun challenge this game provides.

												The game is very much a homage to the old Quest for Glory series, but how does it compare? The soundtrack is alright, none of the pieces are bad, and some are pretty good even. Still, nothing as memorable as most of the pieces in QFG.The voice acting ranges from atrocious to great. Sadly, the narrator is one of the worst voices in the game and you'll be gritting your teeth at how aggravating it is. This coming from a person who loved Sadwick's voice from the Whispered World. Overall the voices are passable, with only a handful of bad voices and only a handful of great ones.The writing is passable for the most part, except for the jokes and ""generic"" messages of the game(when you try to use an item at something that doesn't do anything), which are often painfully bad. It's possible it's just because of the narrator's grating voice, but I couldn't stand the game whenever it tried to be funny or witty in describing things or actions. The visual humor in the game was, after all, alright and even good at times, and I didn't try to play it with the voices off. The graphics are as you would expect from a game of the middle Sierra era, although the character portraits are sometimes(minor characters only) extremely bad. Overall the visual side of the game is quite good.I've only passed the game with one class, so I can't compare the alternative ways to solve problems, but mostly the solutions are logical and easy to come up with. A bit too easy most of the time. On the other hand, I faced two laughably poorly designed problems in my Brigand playthrough. Sadly, the other one is the very first quest of the Brigand story, which will leave you with a very bad taste in your mouth. The overall story is alright, but some parts are extremely rushed and other parts aren't explained at all. It's possible I somehow managed to miss or forget some explanations or content, given that the game isn't too linear as far as point&click games go(for instance, I saw one of the main bad guys only twice in the game, in the beginning for a short monologue, and the final screen of the game for 5 seconds). You can do most of the things in the game in any order you want, which creates a dissonance between action and purpose, as you'll often be holding a handful of items you picked along your way just because you could, only to find out they're something very important that you're later on explicitly told to get. For instance, one character told me to get 4 pieces of a macguffin and explained it'd be a hard task and all that, and I already had 3 pieces in my backpack, creating a very awkward situation from the story perspective. There are also plenty of locations that I couldn't find a meaning to, although I suspect that's because they are meaningful only to the thief and wizard classes. Or perhaps I was merely too foolish to understand them or find out what they were about. Some were clearly alternative paths to take if you so chose, as you could in the old QFG games.The combat mechanics of the game are lackluster and boring, although you can just skip almost all of them by just running past the enemies. So, pretty much the same as in QFG.A badly missing aspect of the game, that was crucial to QFG, are skills. There are only a few skills in the game, that have barely any function. The fighting skills are meaningless since you can drink super-cheap healing potions when you need to(they cost 10 per, and you get 5000 coins within the first few hours of the game). Aside from them, there's sneaking, climbing and thievery. All of them are more or less only necessary for the optional content of robbing houses, which is pretty meaningless since you swim in money anyway. And since you can train the skills by just clicking repeatedly on a place, with no time passing, it is a meaningless excercise. The reason why it worked in the QFG games was that the games had a fairly strict time limit, so you had to choose what to do, when and why. Here, as far as I could tell, you have infinite time so the skill checks might as well not exist since you can grind them up if you choose to.There is a sort of point tallying system in the game, where you gain infamy points for doing things. Unlike the QFG games, where you always saw the maximum amount of points, and could gauge your progress in the game and how well you were doing, here it seems meaningless as there's no comparison point. I got 300 points. I have no idea if that's good or bad. Also, the reasons for gaining points are seemingly random. Suppose you have 5 choices on what to say to a character, they all give different amounts of infamy points in increments of 5. That's the only difference, as far as I could tell. Obviously I'll need to play the game through choosing completely different options to see if there's a meaning to all of it. Sort of related to the points system, you can do small things that seem to have absolutely no point in the game, like giving an expensive gift to a character or the like. Sure, you get an achievement and a line of dialogue or two, but that's pretty lackluster for the cunning needed to purposely purchase an item, deduce whom would want it and give it to them. The deeds themselves aren't really reward enough, since there is little reactivity to it. Again, perhaps I missed something and didn't succeed in doing these ""quests"" properly, but as I have no way of knowing, it's frustrating.Overall the game is pretty much as you'd expect from a serious fan homage to the QFG series. Some bugs remain(mostly voice clips mismathed with the text, some graphical bugs) but they didn't really affect enjoyment of the game. Nowhere near the quality of any of the QFG games, but enjoyable none the less, if you're a fan of the QFG series. If you have never played a Quest for Glory game, you're likely better served by playing one(all) of them rather than this game. But given that the main audience for the game IS the QFG-crowd, I have to recommend it. It's decent enough and will make you remember fondly the classics of yore.			"

Price is too high though, I got it on sale. I think $10 would be fair. I recommend the game anyway, but not really at this price, get it on sale.			"

												While the combat system is boring and easily exploitable (just train blocking until you're invincible), the quest are just undoable withouth a walkthrough:- You get tons of useless items you have to browse through via a clunky interface- You rarely get hints when you are close to solve a puzzle, just the generic ""that does not work here""- Tthe puzzles are quite arbitrary- Lots of pixel hunting is involved. To make it worse, sometimes you click at a correct point, but the protagonist does not react properly and you discard the correct solution.It's oldschool, yes, but mainly regarding it's playability. There are are fun moments in playing an a-hole narrated by a sarcastic voice, but these are outweighted by the drawbacks for my taste.			"

												Gets the feel of Quest for Glory right, while possibly surpassing that in humor and general writing. I played it and kept playing till the end, which I do with a lot of games (though, this isn't very long). Fun and challenging adventure puzzles but I'd say there was only maybe one or two that were a bit too much.Biggest complaint was the inability to steal from any shop owner more than once, which I don't think was stated beforehand, but just in general takes away from one of my favorite parts of many games. I can understand balance wise why they do it, but still a bit annoying.Overall a satisfying experience and I hope a sequel will come.			"

This is best for 12yr old and up.As an adult - I see where it is amusing, but the analogy others reviewers are making to QfG are a stretch.			"

												I cannot recommend this enough. it has everything you want in a point-n-click plus ALL of the text is narrated. There is something so endearing about having a narrator that will call you out when you try to do stupid things, like talk to a door, pet a cat, etc. One of my top five games of the last few years no question. Damn that green broad was super hot too.			"

												Awesome game! Just finished it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has much of the old school adventure games. It is very funny, has nice puzzles and it not too easy, but also not too difficult to play. Some things in the game are supposed to only happen when playing with a specific character, and that was sometimes frustrating. For example, as a sorcerer I didn't manage to get the horse, while it was very obvious that this could be done at some point in the game. The game is not too linear, but some things can only be done/learned after a particular event has happened, and this got me stuck once. The scenery, music and voices were all great. I might give this another try as a thief/brigand :)			"

												Gets the feel of Quest for Glory right, while possibly surpassing that in humor and general writing. I played it and kept playing till the end, which I do with a lot of games (though, this isn't very long). Fun and challenging adventure puzzles but I'd say there was only maybe one or two that were a bit too much.Biggest complaint was the inability to steal from any shop owner more than once, which I don't think was stated beforehand, but just in general takes away from one of my favorite parts of many games. I can understand balance wise why they do it, but still a bit annoying.Overall a satisfying experience and I hope a sequel will come.			"

												YES! YES! YES! A perfect homage to old school adventure games. Great music, really funny, huge open world to explore.The story is loooong. Took me 21 hours to complete, (I only needed to look up 1 hint.) There were some rooms & characters that were not involved with my path (the Bridgand) so after game was done, I read the walkthoughs for the other 2 ways to play. The 3 play methods are very different from each other. You'll get everything needed for the 3 roles, so you'll have a bag full of stuff you won't use. It prevents ""mindless click & combine"" strageies and makes you really think logically. The puzzles are ""medium"" difficulty, I never felt frustrated. It doesnt take a genius to figure these out, but I didnt find them super easy either. Since the world is so big and there are so many characters, it takes lots of time to peice together what you need to do.Captivating & fun from beginning to end. If you like old Sierra & King's Quest games, you'll love this.			"

												This is a throwback to the old Quest For Glory games. It's following in the same path and is just as entertaining. I've only been playing it a few hours and I already feel right at home. If you are a fan of the old Sierra adventure titles then this is something you should buy.			"

												Two years ago I gave Quest for Infamy a 'Not Recommended' review. I thought the game was too cluttered with crushing bugs, unnecessary items and a clunky layout resulting in a game full of fluff and confusion. Throw on top of that a $20  price tag and i ultimately felt that there were better games out there that had a more fullfilling and polished 'Quest for Glory' experience. After posting my review, i was surprised to hear back directly from the creators of the game. They thanked me for my honest opinion and then requested i replay the game with their first major update.Well - I didn't replay it. I figured I gave Quest for Infamy plenty of hours to prove itself a contender, concluded it had not, and moved on.Earlier this year I downloaded Infamous Quest's newest adventure game 'Order of the Thorne' (on GOG) I respected what the indie developer was trying to do for classic adventure games and figured I'd give them another shot. To my surprise, Order of the Thorne was quite charming. I felt like they nailed the old-school 'King's Quest' vibe and found myself eager to play it's next chapter. So, renewed with confidence in Infamous Quest's products, I decided to give Quest for Infamy another go. Replaying the game, I instantly noticed a difference from the updates with how the game presented itself. Gone were the bugs that plagued my first runthrough, cluttered item menus were made more streamline and that clunky feeling that hovered over the game felt far less 'unfinished game' and much more 'Authentic retro adventure game style'. Like my reaction to Order of the Throne, I found myself surprised by the changes and eager to see what the future of Quest for Infamy held. Quest for Infamy isn't perfect, but it's a commendable effort from a developer who cares about their product. Think Quest for Glory with a sprinkling of Liesure Suit Larry - It's a bit raunchy in a good way, and a lot of fun in a retro way. AAAND, for only 10 dollars now, it's definitely a contender.			"

												Heroine's Quest far exceeded this game despite being completely free... but! If you love Quest for Glory, you should play this too. It has a great sense of humor, and wonderful art and acting. The biggest weakness is the *TERRIBLE* battle system, but I think it makes up for it everywhere else.			"

												This game is an instant buy for those who are fans of the Quest for Glory, and/or King's Quest series.If you're into fantasy themed point and click adventure/RPG games then this game is probably for you.It oozes ambience,the music is okay, but the voice acting can be a bit hit and miss. However this didnt ruin the game for me.The 320 x 240 resolution wasnt something that I liked, but I can understand why they went for that look, and that this was developed by a very small team.My preference would be for a far higher resolution that goes down a path similar to the likes of Memorium/The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav.However I do recommend this game to Point and Click adventure fans, if you're on the fence then grab this game when its on sale			"

												This review was originally a positive one. I have recently changed that, reflected in the 2nd edit below:Love this game! Been waiting on 2.0 for more than half a year! Come on guys.Edit: Some of us bought this game a very long time ago now and are STILL waiting on 2.0!2nd Edit: so it is now April 19, 2017, and the devs have been completely silent on this game and the state of the ""new"" update, which I now doubt is even coming. It's been more than a year since the update was mentioned, and almost a year since they claimed it would be released soon. We were told old save games would not work on the forthcoming update, so some of us stopped playing in anticipation of the new features. Tldr: Devs MIA, no responses to inquiries, many months have passed with complete silence. Don't waste your money.			"

												I knew nothing about Quest for Infamy before playing, except that it was a point-and-click adventure. The game is really impressing me. Unlike most point-and-click adventures, Quest for Infamy has a welcome open-world feel. There seems to be a ton of stuff to do and many side quests and multiple ways of progressing. I also love the art style.			"
