Early Access Review
								Do you know crunch? I mean, do you truly know the incredibly visceral, powerful and satisfying feedback that is crunch? Now go into Nuclear Throne and smack a maggots nest with a sledgehammer. Go on, I don't mind. Being inanimate text that a person typed and then abandoned, I have no sense of time. It'll be like kicking good vibes across a punch bowl (I'm also hit-and-miss with simile).Okay, you're back! How was it-- Ohhh, I know that look! Your eyes have the enlightened glint of one who has tried the good stuff, the real deal, the prime reserve. You can't go back, now. Now, you know crunch. The real crunch. This is Nuclear Throne, and it's appeal cannot be simply summed up in a few words. It's referred to as an ""action roguelike-like(-like)"" because it is difficult to put into a genre. Because it is its own genre. If I were to call it anything, it would probably be ""Randomly-Generated Action Crunch with Permadeath"", which I am predicting will be a cereal by 2019 (sans permadeath, unless we don't have randomly-generated cereals by then, in which case I WANT to die).Everything about this game is crunchy. There's a power-up based leveling system (further referred to as they are in game, ""mutations""), a charming and variant cast of playable characters, tons of weapons (about 73 as of this writing, but I was just in on a stream where they rather liked my suggestion of adding nunchuks), crazy enemies, b-skins, rule-altering pickups and even local 2-player! And the art and music-- Ohhh, the art and music! The beautiful and detailed pixel art, the energizing (sometimes haunting) tracks and impeccable sound design frankly shocked me. Such character and atmosphere I found myself immersed in!The game is so easy to pick up, and yet the way you develop your character is incredibly deep. The developers waste none of their time (and consequently, your time) on anything that doesn't feel just awesome. Sure, ""Mutation A"" doesn't seem very good, at first. But once you learn more about ""Characters D and E"" and how they synergize splendidly with ""Mutation A"" when paired with ""Mutation G"", you get an ""Aha"" moment! Like a challenging, yet ultimately rewarding puzzle, Nuclear Throne holds a plethora of ""Aha"" moments for those willing to scratch past the surface and experiment with the MASSIVE number of possible character builds. And you need no mutation to love a samurai chicken! C'mon.The developers are two guys, who comprise Vlambeer, and four others who handle the art, music and sound. They're the most down-to-earth, approachable and generally cool guys to ever make a game, probably (permission to put that on the back cover = granted). They generally update the game every Saturday with new characters, baddies, weapons, difficulty balancing and bug fixes. They even stream themselves developing said changes every Tuesday and Thursday on their Twitch channel (http://www.twitch.tv/vlambeer)! And they take feedback like pros! None of this ""bleuuu, you don't like my game, banned and deleted"" business. They're good people.Oh, and you'll be dying a lot. I didn't ""beat"" the game until I had already logged around 100 hours (there's an end-boss, but you loop back to the beginning with higher difficulty upon defeating it), but that didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying every minute up until that point and after! This is a fantasticly addictive game, with a fantastic community and fantastic developers that is already easy to recommend. The fact that it promises to only get better is just gravy!And yes, I did a ""let's play"":

												I bought this game when it was in its early access period(For 13 dollars multiplied by 4. Yes, my currency sucks) and I recently exprienced most of the content, meaning I can finally review it.Nuclear Throne is a hard(and I mean HARD. at about 9 hours you'll be just getting used to the third area) roguelite top down shooter with a huge variety of weapons(above 140 I believe), a roster of 12(and a few secret) characters, 7 main areas(split into levels) with secret equivelants of most of them, and full of content.Every session is quite short, and there is no end unless you choose to end the run.Every enemy drops EXP upon death(rads), and when you level up you can choose 1 mutation(modifiers) out of a selection of 4 every time for 9 levels, and get a special choice on level 10. Mutations vary from trivial things such as faster move speed to kills reducing reload time.The devs are extremley helpful and active on the forums(at least during the early acces period and until they finish updating the released product) and the community is the last one to be called a toxic community. The game's lore was told partly through little references in-game, lore bits and pieces from twitch streams of the dev and more, and is worth a read on the wiki(Also run by a great guy). Nobody knows all of it(except for the developers), but what we do know is pretty damn good.After defeating the first final boss, if you do a thing the community will eventually notify you about(or wiki), you will loop. Looping is going through the entire game all over again and will never end until you die/get either of the 2 endings.It includes new exclusive content and so much more. The loops are late game, and since they can last forever, the game has to become even more brutal with each loop, and on loop 1 already, without spoiling, you will notice a difficulty spike. Pros -Full of areas to explore, enemies to shoot and die to, weapons, synergies and more.-Will keep you playing for a good amount of time, but still is fit for short sessions if you're just passing time-Amazing and helpful community-Fantastic soundtrack(Personal favorites are Frozen City's B-Track(Ode on the official soundtrack) , and The Nuclear Throne)-Great pixel art that is just beautiful to look at. Cons -It takes a while for RNGesus to make some good weapons become common in the pool after the first time they drop-Sometimes the game would do flat out unfair actions, such a certain telefragging enemy-Inconsistent difficulty curve. Its smooth until the third boss, spikes, stays that way, lowers down a bit in the 7th area's boss and on loops spikes up again and goes through the same curve-Sometimes you just get screwed(even on spawn). RNGesus may not have mercy.-Some secrets that without a wiki/datamining no one would have found.TLDR: NT is a great game to sink hours into, as well as to play in short sessions, is hard, but rewarding and fun, as well as full of content to exprience.

												It's been a long time since I've put as much time into a game as I have with Nuclear Throne. It's a game that captures the sinking lows and heart-pumping highs of an arcade game extremely well. Nuclear Throne just FEELS fun to play. With many other games, I find myself having to think hard to justify why the game is fun or worth my time. With Nuclear Throne, it's very simple. Playing this game is fun as hell. This game wants you dead, and picking it up always feels like a fresh challenge; you vs the game. This game WILL kill you eventually, but you're always given a fun, challenging opportunity to go down swinging.Nuclear Throne is a game that balances chaos and elegance near-perfectly. The characters, weapons, enemies, and upgrades appear very simple at first. An upgrade that gives you +4 HP, so what? But as you progress in your skill and your runs, these simple elements get mixed together at larger scales, and you'll be presented with a unique set of challenges based on your skill and the choices you've made in the run. As you get further in your run, you're given harder enemies, uniquely challenging bosses, and more traps. But you're also given bigger, deadlier guns, and that +4 HP will be your best friend when it saves you from death after you mess up a tight dodge. As the game scales upward and the chaos ramps up, the strength of the simple designs really shines, and when you finally die, it rarely feels cheap, and it's very difficult to not say ""alright, one more run"".

								I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype ""Wasteland Kings"" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced ""roguelike-like"" or ""roguelite"" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).			"

												This has been my go-to game for months now!  There's an incredible amount of variety in the weapons and abilities that you can find, and they get crazier as you go on!  Revolver.  Sledgehammer.  Laser rifle.  Minigun.  Energy sword.  Auto grenade shotgun.  Lightning cannon.  Each character is also completely unique, and plays very differently.  One revolves around spawning minions to assist you, while another can dual wield, an yet another can explode the corpses of defeated enemies!  You can become absurdly powerful, but you're still always vulnerable, and it's PERFECT.  If you have played some of the modern action-roguelikes that are so popular today (Binding of Isaac, Crypt of the Necrodancer), you have likely noticed that you become nearly unstoppable after a while.  In Isaac, you get Brimstone, tammy's head, and holy mantle?  You can't die.  This is not the case with Nuclear Throne!  You can launch nukes into crowds of enemies, you can spawn an entire army of allies to protect you, you can use telekinesis to push away projectiles, and yet the slightest misstep leads to a yeti hurling a car at you, putting your rampage to an explosive end.  And that explosion is going to look good, sound good, and feel good, because the visual and audio design is extremely on point.  You can really feel the power in a gun when you're shooting it.  The only reason I can think of to pass up this game is if you're just not into the challenge of it.  As I said, you can die in an instant at any moment.  You'll generally have 8 HP tops, and a standard bullet does 3 damage.  Many things deal more than that.  You do not get invincibility frames upon being hit (I THINK.  If you do, it's like 2 or 3 frames tops).  If that sounds like a dealbreaker to you, I guess this isn't your kind of game.  If that sounds exciting to you, get the game NOW!  I honestly can't recommend it enough.  Have fun!#VerifyVenuzEdit after full release: I'm still playing this, and it's still glorious fun!  Lots of content and tweaks have been added over the last several months, and I think it lead up to an incredibly solid final product.  If I was told right now that I could only play one game for the rest of my life, I'd probably pick Nuclear Throne.			"

								They always told Fish it didn't exist.  They told him to stop looking for it.  Maybe it's for the best that they stayed behind.The Throne is even more glorious than he had ever imagined.  It speaks of hope, of power unlimited, of rebirth, of restoration.  It could save him.  It could turn back all of this.  It could give him everything he wanted.  It could put him at the pinnacle of the new world.His reverie is interrupted by a sound from Crystal, shifting uncomfortably on her stubby feet.  In an instant he knows why, his heart sinking into his stomach, feeling like it's about to herniate.  Of the six of them that set out toward the Throne, five made it -- and there's only one seat.He admits, they had joked a little about that along the way, about the possibility that only one of them would get to sit on the Throne, about whom the honour would go to.  They had all laughed when Robot weighed in: ""SELECT MUTANTNAME FROM TEAMMATES WHERE THRONEBUTT_QUALITY = (SELECT MAX(THRONEBUTT_QUALITY) FROM TEAMMATES);” But nobody's laughing now.  Fish knows what everybody's doing, before he even looks around.  Every one of them is a trained killer, and they’re all evaluating former friends, making up minds about whom to kill first.Crystal's tough on the exterior, but she's likely to crack once she sees her family start killing each other off.  It was hard enough for her when she wasn't able to save Eyes from the Horror.  Rebel's got thicker blood flowing through her, though.  Fish knows she'd kill him just as easily as one of her minions if it tried to jump on the Throne.  Y.V. is a wildcard; Fish doesn’t even know why he'd bother with going for the Throne in the first place or what he intends for it.  Robot's the biggest worry -- it's made clear time and time again that the Throne is its greatest priority, but not whether it needs to sit on it.  If it does, there's no question that it'll eliminate all of them once they’re no longer of use.Is Fish or the others of any further use to Robot?  All of them are staring at it now, hands tensed, drifting instinctively towards gun belts.  Crystal's eyes catch Fish’s, and he nods -- then a sudden crash almost throws fish off his webbed feet.  Instantly everyone is facing the Throne again, as ports around its base start to open, and... Something... starts to unearth itself.The team moves as one again as they back away, drawing weapons simultaneously, as the throne lifts slowly up from the floor, looming down toward them.  Green lights blaze forth from it as guns swing into position, a dozen giga-capacitors whining, charging up for the Throne's first volley.  Automated defences, they should have known.Crystal takes a dash forward and holds her arms out to either side, but fish grabs her and pulls her back before she can harden, warning her not to throw herself away on the Throne's massive claws.  She nods, and her feet fuse to the floor anyway, as she hefts her minigun and begins firing alongside the rest of the group. Now singing a melancholy dirge, Fish fires hot plasma into the thrones hull. There's no telling which one of fish’s teammates is going to survive this fight, but he knows he’ll lay down his life for any of them. As long as it ensures that one of them -- any of them -- makes it onto that seat...			"

								50 hours in, finally made my first loop and I feel prepared to write a review. This game is fantastic. There is a ton of content and it's updated weekly. Additionally, this game is hard. If you don't like hard games that take a lot of practice and concentration to be good at, this isn't a game for you. As I said, I played more than 50 hours before beating it the first time, and I want to go play it again right now. There is a ton of replayability and overall I would tell anyone to buy it.			"

												While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy ""bullet-hell"" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish ""mutants"", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.Originally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.As a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. Some might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.UPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since ""abandoned"" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...			"

Early Access Review
 Playtime and Time/money I don't seem to have a lot of playtime for this game, but I can assure you that I play this game very often when I'm no longer connected to the internet. My playtime aside you may be wondering ""Well what kind of value can I get from this game that looks like a bullet hell kind of game?""A lot.So first off, the game is endless. That's a big score there, next off is that the game gets harder each time you go through, most of the time getting far too ridiculous by loop 6. So for the most part it lasts a very long time. Recently they've done up the co-op so that it works properly, and while my friends are scrubs and can't handle the game very much I can revive them by picking up health, which makes it playable as a couch co-op game.I don't know my exact hours on this game, but so far I'd say it has to be in the 40s so 13/40= 0.325/hour+ So for it's value it's really well worth it and still playing itself out. Exactly what is this game? Bullet-Hell-rogue-like-top-down-shooter-bit-graphics game with a fair system and an artificial difficulty slide, along with a slew of good unique playable characters, complete with daily challenges/leader boards and Co-op playing.So now the standard game rating:Story: 3/10 You and your mutant buddies have to go find the nuclear throne, on the journey there you become more and more mutated and then you do stuff like shooting things (spoilers) The story is not the very deep kind.Gameplay: 10/10 I already explained what type of game this is, but it's both satisfying and has a high skill cap to it. You can play it to perfection and at the same time you could get royally ♥♥♥♥ed over or on the other end gifted by the gods at Vlambeer.Presentation: 10/10 Nothing to complain about. At all. the game looks how it should, it plays how it should and it acts how it should. I haven't come across any game breakers be it by immersion or by engine failures. Not only that but its fairly cheap on system use.Soundtrack: 10/10 Memorable, lovable soundtrack. I love it. Plain and simple.Replayability: 10/10 This is the sort of game that you play when you feel like setting a new record, or when you feel like shooting up a bunch of aliens, or when you have a friend over and you want to show them ur skillzzz All of it is worth playing over again.

FRIENDLY REMINDER something you must be aware of before buyingNuclear Throne can be quite a stressful game that can lead you to have several rage moments so, if you can't really deal with this, I must say that this game is NOT for you and you should stay away from it. It's a very punishing game and small mistakes can lead you to death.ABOUT what is this game all about?Nuclear Throne is an action shoot em' up roguelike game made by Vlambeer, where your objective is to reach the Nuclear Throne, your main enemy in the game.STORY does this game even have a story?Some people might not know this, but this game actually has a background story. But, since this is not the main ""star of the show"", it's okay for the game to have a lack of detailed storyline.Humanity messed up with things and the world is nearly destroyed, although things still managed to live in such conditions. Along with creatures being mutated (and a human as well, this being Steroids), portals started to appear and those started teleporting mutants around the wasteland.A mutant called ""Proto Mutant"" discovered a place called The Palace, a place that is set to keep the world's balance, to keep it stable and we all know that's not the current case. Whenever a mutant stands up and gains strength enough to be able to do something against this mess that the world is, it gets sucked into a portal and disappear.Other mutants heard about this myth and about the Nuclear Throne as well, which if destroyed, the world will get stabilized again, thus the game begins... .There are some more details, but it could be considered a spoiler at some point. If you're interested in knowing more about it, you could simply check the game's Wikia and find out yourself. GAMEPLAY what do I do in this game?Nuclear Throne is a game with a big focus on gameplay and it would be a shame if it weren't good, right? This game has playstyle similar to the well-known Binding of Isaac, but way faster. The controls are easy to understand and are really responsive. At first, it will be a little bit boring because of the lack of things happening, but as you progress through levels, things get better and way faster! Fun and challenging.In a nutshell: You shoot things. Things die. Get weapon upgrades and new mutations to power yourself up. Progress to the next area. Repeat until you reach the Nuclear Throne.The sad thing about this game is that it lacks an online Multiplayer, only a local Multiplayer option, which is not that bad, but since this game requires a lot of precision and quick responses, using a gamepad to play with someone else is a pain in the ♥♥♥, unless you manage to use two keyboards and two mices.SOUNDTRACK & SOUNDS how's the music and sound effects?Vlambeer did an awesome job with the soundtrack the same way they did with GUN GODZ and their other games, the musics and songs fit really well. Boss battles, areas and everything else. And the mutants' voices and sound effects, like weapons and such are really well made as well.GRAPHICS wow, next gen. graphics plz!1!You can probably tell that this game has pixelated graphics and, if you're a fan of super detailed and realistic graphics, this is not for you. The sprites in the game are well-made, the scenarios are great and suit each enemey very well. Also, their promotional art is awesome!DIFFICULTY how difficult is this anyway?Okay, so, if there's a negative review out there, it probably is because of the difficulty and learning curve on this game. This is a really punishing game and little mistakes will make you get to the start of the game within a second, you must be cautious and think fast. As mentioned above, if you're a person that gets mad really fast or dislike games that are really difficult, you should probably avoid this.REPLAY VALUE how many hours can I put in this?It's a ""short"" game and you are going to die A LOT, I assure you, if this game didn't have a great replay value, it would be absolute sh*t. If you enjoyed your first runs, you're probably going to enjoy the rest of it, since you're always progressing through the game, learning new things, trying out other mutants and mutations, yada, yada.PERSONAL OPINION what do you thinka 'bout the game after all?More like a TL;DR, I guess. It's an awesome game with fast gameplay, charming graphics, responsive controls and incredible replay value, I highly recommend it if you're a big fan of the genre, and, since it finally released, there's no need for you to be hesitant about the early access part. Vlambeer will probably keep updating the game, so, there's much more content to come and much more to enjoy. Also, if you know and enjoyed the abovementioned Binding of Isaac and want to ""spice things up"" and have a more ""breathtaking"" experience, give this game a shot.There are also some other aspects of this game that might be a turnoff to some people, such as: no widescreen option and 30 fps cap. Just wanted to point it out, since some dislike this.			"

Early Access Review
								Don't let the 'early access' tag scare you away; Nuclear Throne is well worth picking up now, and the constant updates feel more like free content packs than they do updates to a work-in-progress. Nuclear Throne is a tough-as-hell roguelike-like in the vein of Binding of Isaac; an overhead shooter blending fast-paced challenging action with RPG elements and random levels/progression. Different characters (more still being added), randomly generated levels and random mutations as you progress make each playthrough different, and allow you to experiment with different playstyles, though there are different 'areas' that keep consistent style over the course of a few levels. Just to give you an idea of how different each game can be/how awesome the designs are, these are the current mutants you can play as: -Fish, who gets more ammo than the other characters, and can use his roll to dodge bullets.-Crystal, who has more health than the others, and can become an invulnerable shield which deflects bullts.-Eyes, who can see in the dark and can use his telekinetic powers to pull enemies toward him and push projectiles away.-Melting, a skeleton with melted flesh hanging off, has the lowest HP, but mutates faster and can blow up corpses.-Plant, a sentient plant that can move faster than the others, and snare enemies with his roots.-Y.V., a weird looking illuminati pyramid with an eyeball, can shoot faster than the others, and use his ablility to shoot twice with one pull of the trigger.-Steroids, a beefed up dude that starts with two fully loaded pistols and the ability to use both of the weapons he can carry at once.-Robot, who can find better weapons, and recycle found items into ammo for another weapon he carries, or health.-Chicken, a mutant chicken that starts wielding a katana and can slow down time. Chicken's other ability allows her to live a few seconds after death, and gives you a little time to go berserk, a headless chicken with a katana, hacking frantically, hoping for a health drop to bring her back from death.-Rebel, an ex-bandit who can sacrifice her health to summon allies, and blasts in all directions when hit. -Horror, a radioactive mutant dog(?) that can use radiation collected to launch a wave of destruction at his enemies.The designs are creative and fun, the art is great, the music and sounds keep things frantic and intense, the gameplay is solid, and most important of all, it's incredibly fun. This is one of the best games to come out this year, and if it looks interesting to you, grab it right now.The throne definitely exists.			"

Early Access Review
								(scroll down for tl;dr)I love this game. I love it so much that I have nearly 500 hours into it. I wouldn't so much call this a review, just some (hopefully) objective experiences I personally had for the game I love so much while explaining a bit of the game in general.*Characters*Nuclear Throne sports a roster of 12 playable characters, diverse with their own unique passive and active ability. From shielding to bullet-time, to air strikes to rolling, every character offers up a variable play-style each go around. The art for the game suits the game's overall direction and is generally nice to look at. Remember this is still early access: We've had some hilarious placeholder ms-paint stick-figure art that would be redrawn into worthwhile, lovely pixel portraits. You can watch the developer stream to see just how great the art assets become as it's being done live.*Mechanics*Despite its seemingly very simplistic design, the game coddles a sinking depth in terms of mutation selection, weapon diversity and character synergy that overlaps well with one another. MutationsThe core component of your journeys in the wasteland. I'd categorize mutations in the following categories:Weaponry - Mutations that give certain weapon types added benefitsUtility - Mutations that directly or indirectly buffs your character through various meansSurvivability - Mutations that increases the players lifespanMutations are randomly generated out of a mix of 4 (5 for a specific character) which can provide you with a mixed variety of mutations. Each mutation handles, generally, fairly better or fairly worse for every character and finding a good synergy is key. Aside from the regular mutations, each character that reaches Level 10 (Ultra) gets to choose from 2 (3 for a specific character) Ultra Mutations. These are generally better than regular mutations and, generally, are a power spike to the character.WeaponsAs of now, there are over 100 weapons in the game, categorized in 6 different weapon types, with multiple subcategories: Bolt - ex. Crossbow (Bolts, Splinters, Seekers, Disc)Bullet - ex. Machinegun (Bullets, Pellets)Energy - ex. Plasma Minigun (Laser, Plasma, Lightning)Explosive - ex. Grenade Launcher (Launchers, Cannons)Melee - ex. Sledgehammer (Non-ammo, Hybrids)Shell - ex. Shotgun (Flaming Pellets, Slugs)Many weapons perform differently under many circumstances and get better by taking the mutation for the specified weapon. Weapons are tiered and drop according to how far you have progressed in the game. To go into the details of every weapon would be exhausting and I will not do that for the sake of this already wall-of-text-y piece. (but we all know there's only one true energy weapon)*Gameplay*At its core, Nuclear Throne is a rogue-like, twinstick shooter bolstered by the accompanying variants and mechanics the game brings to the table. It's a really fast paced action shooter  with split-second decision making keeping you on your feet. Unlike most games with randomly generated variables, you don't totally live and die by the RNG. It does indeed factor into the game and what weapons, mutations, etc you get throughout a run, but usually player skill will often trump in a nerve-wracking circumstance. Nuclear Throne is a game about trial and error. That is, in order to get better at the game, you will need to lose. A lot. Like I mean it, a LOT. I can recount a fair number of times I have died in situations similar to my 5th hour in the game in my nearly 500 hours of it. Half of your first few hours with the game will be spent looking at your post-death stats screen. That is how often you will be dead. You have to realize and understand how everything went wrong and learn from it. But that's it for this review, I've spent more time than I originally planned typing this up. I hope something in this post inspires you to try the game out despite it being in early access. It's a game that is really worth the money.(tldr)(the less dishonest review)Lightning Cannon is JesusRami is RNGodShielders are bull ♥♥♥♥Necromancers are bull ♥♥♥♥Maggots are OPMultiple gold scorpion spawns is Rami showing dissatisfaction with you livingIf you die, Rami was dissatisfied with you living.100/10 game, would be sodomized backpedaling into an assassin again.

Early Access Review
Nuclear ThroneRoguelike/Bullet-hell/Top-Down Shooter9/10 Has the potential to be a 10/10 if the devs keep up the amazing updates and fix a few things here and there  Tl:Dr; A MUST BUY for all roguelike fans and all fans of Binding of Isaac and Hotline Miami I came across this game when some friends would not stop raving about it. I promptly checked it out and was not impressed at first and thought ""Why buy this game when I can just play Binding of Isaac?"" The answer to that question is fairly simple. Nuclear Throne takes the charm and bullet hell fun of BoI and adapts it (or mutates it) into a whole nother experience and game. I was gifted the game but for a while I did not play the game simply saying ""I don't have time for a BoI clone"". After putting in 11 hours over 2 weeks I can safely say that I was wrong and I honestly enjoy this game very much.The Community is very active and very kind to everyone and honestly one of the best gaming commuities I have seen. They're all very excited about the game and very active. Some people have made mods for Nuclear Throne but I have yet to download one.  Story:  	The lore is currently in the wiki but has not been applied to the game yet. However, the story does not take/give any enjoyment to the game so that is a huge plus. You can load into the game and not have to worry about advancing in the story or missing dialogue.  Characters: 	There are a wide assortment of playable characters, currently at 12. Each character has unique passive and actives so that playing each character is like playing a new game. Each characters active is gamechanging and are useful in their own ways (except Plant's. Because ♥♥♥♥ you Plant. I don't need your stupid snare in my life all you're doing is holding me down) For the sake of simplicity I'm not going to list each character out but I can say that I have played each character over 20 times and even then I feel as though I only have a basic understanding of how to use them. My current favorite character to use is Rebel, her healing when you enter portals is one of the most useful passives if you are as reckless as me when playing. Her active ability allows her to sacrifice health to summon a minion who will aid you in your battle before exploding dealing more damage to surrounding enemies. Some fan favorites are Steroids, Y.V., and Crystal and there are so many well drawn fan art of the game to show people's love for all the different characters.   Sound:  	 The music in the game is definitely one good thing amongst a lot of good things about this game. Each level has a unique song that plays while you desperate shoot your way to the throne. Each song fits it's level well and when I first started, I found myself hating the music because at times I find myself being pressured by the music and dying. But now when I play I find myself humming along as I shoot enemies in the face.   Mutations:  	Everytime you kill an enemy they drop something called rads (radiation). Each rad you collect goes torward leveling up. If you level up once you finish the level (aka enter the portal) you can pick a mutation (they're like perks). There are weapon based perks (homing bolts, shotgun shells bounce farther, energy weapons deal more damage) and there are basic mutations (more health, enemies have less health, move faster, chance of ammo on kills. Each mutation will help you get to the throne but like most games there are some mutations that are better than others. Currently, it's advised not to take the weapon mutations unless you are 100% sure that you're going to keep that weapon for the rest of the game. There are also canisters that give you a lot of rads. When a character reaches level 10 you can choose a Ultra mutation that are a huge power spike to the character.  Weapons:  At the time of writing this review, there are 104 weapons able to be found in the game. The devs have promised to add more which is incredible. The basic weapon classes are Bullet, Shell, Bolt, Explosive, Energy, and Melee. There are subcatagories in these ammo catagories and each gun feels different to use. My personal favorites are the Assault Rifle (there are a lot of guns that ""outclass  and outdamage this gun but I love the 3 bullet burst) and the Heavy Auto Crossbow (the heavy cross bow is pretty much a 1 shot on all enemy minions and it takes down the bosses in a few shots. The auto portion makes it so that you can kill them faster). Some weapons are known to be bad such as the smg (too much ammo is being wasted in a non accurate fire) and the laser pistol because the damage feels minisicule and it takes far too long in between shots. You can find ammo and weapons in chests.   Mechanics:  The game plays like a Rogue-like, top down shooter. You're expected to die a lot and the game is simple enough to play over and over again in short bursts. When I first started what I used to do was cover shoot from afar. I soon found out that this was not a good tactic because it led to me being able to be swarmed and I could not collect rads/ammo/guns. The tactic that works best for me is to run around and don't be afraid to get too close to the mobs because most of the time you can dodge what's coming at you and you need to collect all the rads. It's better to find your own playstyle and the game is all about trial and error. Make a mistake once? Don't do it again.There's also a daily run. Meaning once a day you're given the same seed as everyone else and see how you rank against them. It's pretty fun to wait to play your next daily and see yourself go up the ranks.  Cons: There's very little that I can complain about the game. It's fairly polished looks great. However, little does not mean none. 4/10 times you're going to die/get really injured because you spawned in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ place. I once had a run where I spawned in the middle of the map surrounded by scorpions.The game is on the border of becoming a bullet hell. Enemies will fire at you from halfway across the map often times cornering you.Sometimes the framerate will go to ♥♥♥♥ (mostly during explosions) and might cause you to die.You can't really change the resolution. I have a 1366x768 monitor but the game does not play in that. The highest resolution I get is 1920x1200 and even that looks a bit meh.The game looks to have a low learning curve but the first 10-20 runs are going to be you staring at the post death stats screen. You need to push yourself not to give up at first but once the ball gets rolling Nuclear Throne becomes a game that you'll definitely look forward to playing often.  Wrap Up Overall, I think that Nuclear Throne is definitely one of the best rogue-likes I personally, have ever played and it is definitely worth the $15 that the devs ask for. Especially since on release the game will cost more. I highly reccomend you pick this up even if you played Binding of Isaac once and thought it was ok. This game has the potential to become as popular if not more than BoI (not that BoI isn't amazing too). The problems I had with the game were minor and did not take me away from the game. The devs have promised the community many things and I see them going through with their promises so I think that's really cool of Vlambeer (nearly all of their games are fun to play)Again, I found myself very pleased by the game and will definitely be playing more of it.

								I love Vlambear, so this was definitely on my radar.  PROS - Range of characters.- Easy to get into.- Regular updates.- Fantastic developers. CONS -  The perk system could use some work. Other than the one con, which can easily be fixed, this game is a full recommendation from me.(If you buy it off the humble store Vlambear get a cut off the sale and it supports the humble staff!)Update (8/8/14): Seems the perk system has been improved so that complaint can be removed.Update (29/8/14): After further addiction to this game, I can confirm it is a solid 10/10. It is by far in my top 10 games ever made.			"

								BUY THIS GAME SOONER THAN LATERThis is by far the best early access game out there. The community is amazing, and Vlambeer is heavily involved. They update the game every week, and they are significant updates each time! It is exciting to be a part of.This game rivals Spelunky in both difficulty and replayability. And that is while it's still in beta.Where it already has a leg up, however, is the insane amount of playstyles and builds that you can find while playing, due to a variety of unique characters, (9 so far) unique weapons, (~40 so far) mutations for your character (24), special unlockable ""golden"" weapons, and special unlockable crowns that alter the way the game rules work.It is the best bullet hell game I have ever played. It is high octane, and feels amazing to play.As you can see from my hours, I have no problem recommending this game.			"

								Wow, what can I say about Nuclear Throne? Let me give you my gaming context for this review, I am an adult gamer, I have been gaming since I was in first grade and my parents bought me an NES. I've played through the subsequent console generations and of course I have always been a PC gamer. So it is within that context that I saw Nuclear Throne easily makes my top 20 games of all time list. This game is still in early access yet has a great amount of depth, polish, and ""feel"". It is a top down shooter, you can play it as a twn stick though mouse and keyboard is recommended. You choose from among several class all with unique abilities that will inform your play style. As befits a rogue-lite it has random generation, punishing difficulty, and leveling with each level allowing you to choose from among a small pool of mutations. This game has sucked me in, I am fast approaching 300 hours in it. Even as you die you will be hitting R to restart and get right back into the action. Eventually you will learn how to play well and even defeat the throne and start looping. They have a daily challenge now, like Spelunky and the continue to work on this game, adding content and polish, long after it could be considered a compete game.If you like old school games, if you like fast paced games, if you like addictive games designed by people who really know what moment to moment gameplay should feel like, then buy this game. This is an instant classic.			"

Early Access Review
								If you like fast-paced, randomly generated rogue-likes, then this is the perfect game for you. Nuclear Throne is another great game by one of my favorite developer teams, Vlambeer. You're a mutant stuck in the wasteland with all of your friends, and you've all heard the tale of the Nuclear Throne. Some think it's a bunch of baloney, others think that it really exists, and a few mutants are going to go out of their way to get to it. You are one of those few mutants. One of those few mutants, who is also really well balanced with the other mutants in terms of power.NOTE: If the character's name has a star (*) next to it in the list, then it means it's one of my favorites.FISH*: Once a police officer, now turned into a scaly fish-man on the last day before his retirement. He gets more ammo from all sources of the stuff, and can roll out of danger.CRYSTAL: An okay mutant for the new players, Crystal gets more HP and can briefly shield herself to block almost all attacks. After all, ""Crystal can handle this."" Though, don't get too attached to her shield, or you might not be the best at dodging.EYES*: He has a deep backstory, according to the devs, but he doesn't have a mouth to speak about it. He can see much clearer in the dark levels like the Sewers, and he can use telekinesis to drag enemies towards him and projectiles away from him. He is super underrated.MELTING: The wind hurts. Everything hurts. Melting is tired. Melting starts out with 2 HP (keep in mind, most projectiles do 3 damage), but to balance that out, he gets more radiation (in other words, experience), and can blow up corpses for immense damage potential. You should really get acquainted with the game before you try him out!PLANT*: Assuming you've gotten pretty good at this game, Plant is basically the anti-bad RNG character. He's extra fast, and can also trap enemies with vine snares. KILL KILL KILL.YUNG VENUZ*: Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Gun God! He has a faster rate of fire, as well as being able to fire two shots at once (with double the reload time, of course). Also, he doesn't even die. Whenever you reach 0 HP, he just gets frustrated with himself and goes home to his mansion.STEROIDS*: He was the only human who came prepared. He predicted the apocalypse and pumped himself full of steroids to survive. Every weapon he holds is fully automatic and he can dual-wield, but he has less accuracy to compensate.ROBOT: An automaton straight from the future. He finds better weapons earlier, and can eat guns if he doesn't like 'em (robots can digest anything, according to the game).CHICKEN: A samurai chicken. Enough said. She's another good mutant to start with (yes, SHE), as she starts out with her good ol' sword and can throw her weapons! If her health reaches zero, she simply becomes beheaded and you will need to collect a medkit within 3 seconds! During this time, the screen does not move and you can kill everything you'd like to. Upon getting beheaded, you'll have two less max HP, and lost max HP can be restored with the mutation ""Last Wish"" or by getting a big medkit.REBEL: A bandit who detached from the group, she's found home around the campfire of mutants. She's probably one of the most fun to play as if you can get her late game. She heals when she goes through portals, and she can spawn allies to help her.ROGUE: Similar to Rebel, Rogue is a cop that, as her name says, went rogue and left the Interdimensional Police Department (I.D.P.D). As a result, she is constantly being hunted throughout the adventure by the po-po. To combat them, she comes equipped with a weapon she stole after leaving, the Portal Strike, which has potential for immense damage.[CLASSIFIED]: A living blob of [CLASSIFIED], [CLASSIFIED] can fire a beam of [CLASSIFIED] to kill stuff. He also gets an extra [CLASSIFIED] to choose from. He's a secret![CLASSIFIED]: Basically the worst character in the game. He's a super secret that you get while playing as [CLASSIFIED] if you die inside of a [CLASSIFIED]. He starts out with less health, speed, and accuracy, and his ability allows him to [CLASSIFIED] with a chance of taking 1 point of damage.[CLASSIFIED]*: One of my favorites, he is immune to [CLASSIFIED], and can fart out the stuff he's immune to! Sadly, he can never stop [CLASSIFIED]. You get him by damaging [CLASSIFIED] at least once with a golden weapon, keeping that golden weapon to the end of the fight, and picking up the [CLASSIFIED] that the [CLASSIFIED] drops. Take it to a [CLASSIFIED] and put it in a [CLASSIFIED], then go to the same [CLASSIFIED] with a different character and open up the [CLASSIFIED] to get a [CLASSIFIED]. Keep it to the next level and you will be able to play as [CLASSIFIED] once you select the [CLASSIFIED]!PROS:-Replayability is off the charts!-Graphics, gameplay, and music are all really enjoyable.-Good variety of... everything!-Nice team of developers.CONS:-RNG can screw you over, and does so way too often.-Has a chronic disease of NEVER TELLING YOU WHAT ANYTHING DOES (I.E. snipers are OBVIOUSLY suicide-bombers, obviously...)-Don't have quick reflexes? You're dead already.If you're a fan of rogue-likes, buy this game. Go. Buy it. Don't keep staring at this review.Shove your wallet in to the computer.Go.Now.			"

												I remember getting controller-throwing angry at games when I was a kid. Sometimes it was because they were too hard, sometimes they were unfair, and sometimes I was just being dumb about something. It's been a long time since I last felt that kind of rage boil up within me, but Nuclear Throne sure does take me back. It has a vicious streak that runs deeper than even its peers on Steam, and yet that might just be one of the reasons I keep coming back to it.Nuclear Throne is the story of some plucky little mutants blasting their way across an apocalyptic hellscape to reach the throne of legend. There's a whole lot of far less plucky mutants standing in their way, and plenty of guns and things that explode to help you get past them. As a frantic twin-stick shooter you'll be dodging gunfire and explosions while blasting every foe you can find on the cramped, maze-like maps to open a portal to the next murderbox. It's a long journey, fraught with traps and monsters, but loads of secrets to uncover as well. And you're not going to see any of it for a very, very long time.Nuclear Throne is hard. I'm sure you can name plenty of games that you think are hard or that took you awhile to master, but none of that matters because this one is just going to kick you in the ♥♥♥♥ over and over and over. Every new enemy you meet might very well tear your face off instantly and force you to claw your way back to it just to figure out how to beat it. You're going to shoot the wrong thing and blow yourself up despite having full health and plenty of bonuses. Your weapons are going to run dry and your foes are going to laugh as they flay you to pieces.All of this is by design, because Nuclear Throne is a game that you learn and practice and eventually master to an incredible sense of gratification. Just getting the first few bosses down feels like an enormous accomplishment, in large part for all the things you need to remember to survive. For being such a modern twin-stick shooter this game takes a lot of inspiration from ancient roguelikes that had all sorts of weird, arcane rules to remember if you wanted to succeed. Here you have to know what explodes, what is weak to what, what all the enemy attack tells are, and so on. Forget a single point and you risk instant death.Does that sound fun to you? It isn't at first, but just like the best roguelikes it instills this dogged determination in you to overcome such adversity. There are a load of characters to unlock, each with drastically different playstyles to learn and master. Seriously, these mutants can eat guns, explode corpses, warp reality, and more. Collecting radioactives dropped from enemies can level you up and give access to powerful mutations but pickups in this game vanish fast, pressing you to play bold and dive deep and probably die again trying to grab some rads or ammo. You can carry two weapons plucked from an impressive lineup of machine guns, shotguns, explosives, beam weapons, and grander things. Finding an effective pair for any situation and balancing their ammo use is yet another challenge to keep track of, one complicated by the single weapon chest in each level you'll usually have to work with. You need to make every shot count, and you won't really have the luxury of avoiding weapons that don't click, at least at first.If you've gotten this far into the review without running for the hills, Nuclear Throne is the game for you. It's hard, it's cruel, it's relentless, and it comes at you at such a pace that you'll have little chance to prepare or recover. But it's ultimately fair, and the hours of study and practice it demands are rewarded with mastery and tantalizing secrets. I've had a hard time getting into Nuclear Throne because it's honestly not quite the style of roguelike I enjoy. Starting out you're going to be chipping away at the same enemies in the same levels in the same order for hours, lacking any real variation besides the weapons you find and the layouts of the maps. There isn't really any exploration to speak of until you learn what you're looking for, and even then it's just a particular trigger hidden among the scenery. I'm going to keep at it though, because there's a lot to see and do here behind a pretty towering difficulty curve, and I'm just starting to peek at the wonders that lie there.			"

								In its current stage of early access, this game in a word is ""tight"".Dubbed as an action roguelike, Nuclear Throne is a twitchy top-down bullet hell shooter with over 100 weapons and a multitude of different characters, abilities and modifiers in the form of ""mutations"". Throw in an insane difficulty level, procedural level generation and a vast array of secrets and you have a title that will have you putting yourself into its mercy time and time again.The way the levels are generated assures that the weapons, upgrades and enemies the game throws at you will always feel fresh. It also forces you to adapt to a large number of possible scenarios, most of which require pretty fast reactions to survive. The learning curve is steep, hitpoints are low, enemies are relentless and you can expect to have your ego crushed a lot, but if it's something that you are comfortable to see through then progress becomes just that little bit more rewarding. Oh, and say goodbye to immunity frames.Visually the game is very neat, with a pixel-proud charm that doesn't come at the cost of slowing down the action. Music  is well done and the sound effects / enemy sounds are all great. All the characters now also have their own unique voices (by some notable names in the VG voice-over scene) which really adds to the overall feel.Performance-wise there have been no problems, runs well and no bugs encountered so far despite being in early access. Both controller and mouse + keyboard layouts are supported, and the game is always going to respond to your inputs immediately. Very important for a game with a pace this high.Recommended if you're a fan of roguelikes or twitchy shooters as a whole, or if you're just looking for something to remind you what the word ""challenge"" really means. Not recommended if the thought of replacing any part of your PC after an incident of rage is a turnoff.			"

												Nuclear Throne is a top-down shooter made by Vlambeer, where a group of mutants go through the wasteland in a planet full of radiation and other mutants that want to kill you, and the police of another dimension chase you aswell, and your plain goal is to reach the Nuclear Throne. Fish can Roll.The gameplay is simplistic, it's sort of a bullet hell, having a low amount of HP and enemies attacking you from every direction. Some enemies charge at you, other attack you from a distance, others spew fire and others blow up. The game is separeted in 8 areas, having 4 areas with 3 levels in a row and other 4 with 1 level, and each of them having a respective secret are and 2 areas having a special Crown Vault with modifiers for your playthrough. Fish can Roll.The mutants are each specially made for a special type of player. Fish is mobile and gets a lot of ammo, Crystal is a Tank, Melting is a Glass Cannon, Steroids is a ammo-hose, Rebel is a summoner, and Rogue is hard-mode. They're all built for different players and different playstyles. Each character has a special passive and a special active (right click) and there are 2 secret characters and 1 of them isn't available from the start. Also, if you're playing Y.V., pressing B will give you a golden version of your current gun. Also, fish can roll.The game has very simplistic controls, WASD and shooting with left click. That's it. The graphics is classic and beautiful pixel-art. The music is very atmospheric (I love Y.V.s Mansion's theme) and puts you in the place of the mutant you're playing. The game has a special seed for each day to compete agaisnt other players and a special seed with restricted starting character and crowns. Press right click as fish to roll.The bosses are unique and have a ""charm"" to their areas. For example, the wasteland boss is a bigger and more powerful bandit with a machinegun. The wasteland boss is a giant 3-headed pitbull mutated dog. The game has a leveling system where you collect radiation to get mutations, and after 8 mutations you get a specific ""Ultra"" mutation for you character.The game also encourages ammo management, as it is a issue on the wasteland. Rolling can be done as fish.After the game is beaten (you reach the Nuclear Throne and things happen) you can do something special at the final boss to ""loop"" the game, where you can beat the game again, but a lot harder and with 3 special new bosses and police going after you like crazy. This is great for highscorers, since the game has no end and you get a very high score depending on your skill. All in all, great game and should definately be played. It has launched some time ago after 2 years of early access and still gets lots of updates. Fish can roll.YOU DID NOT REACH THE NUCLEAR THRONE9/10 "

												This game is currently in early access. The thing is, it doesn't feel like it is! The devs could very easily be done with it in the current state of this review. They have updated over 90 TIMES! So yeah, don't worry about the early access thing.Pros:- tons of weapons with different playstyles and advantages- each character feels different in a unique way- devs update EXTREMELY consistently- devs are very kind and willing to help- the game is very hard, but fair. you never die because of a bug or a glitch- learning curve isn't that steep ( like binding of isaac's )- lightning cannon is godly- community is one of the best communities I've ever seen- RNG that makes every run a little bit different- dank meme possibilities- JW and his nasty tricksCons:- difficulty might be too hard for some people- the dang screwdriver sucks- JW and his nasty tricksI rate this 10/10 :DEDIT:The game is finally out of early access and I have 200 hours on it! Amazing gane even after so much playtime!			"

												Much has been written about “Game Feel”, yet it’s still a nebulous and largely indefinable concept. On the surface, Nuclear Throne isn’t special. Top-down, rogue-lite shooters are abundant on Steam these days, and it doesn’t ostensibly do much to distinguish itself. But Nuclear Throne simply FEELS wonderful to play – a combination of tight controls, punchy sound effects, an energetically grimy soundtrack, and a satisfying gameplay loop establish Nuclear Throne as the best of its genre.At times, the RNG can generate level layouts that border on unfair, but spawning in an unfortunate location and blasting your way out of imminent doom is awfully satisfying. Yes, certain weapon drops can make your run much easier, but no weapon build is truly unplayable (save for the Disc Gun, maybe). Progression is measured not through unlockables but by your increasing skill level, and very few games have made incremental success feel as gratifying to me as Nuclear Throne. The game is brutally difficult, so it’s definitely not for everyone. For anyone who enjoys the challenge of mastering a game’s nuances through repetition and practice, I highly recommend Nuclear Throne. Its seemingly simple components combine to induce a state of Flow in me the way few games ever have.			"

												Nuclear Throne is one of the best games I've played in a long time.It offers tight gameplay based entirely on your skill and a teensy bit of RNG. The RNG is acceptable enough, you usually get at least something you'll like by the time it actually matters.You never feel cheated by the game. Any time you fail, it's almost certainly your fault. I can think of exactly one instance where the game becomes unfair, and that's with IDPD Vans. But those only appear much later into the game, and... hopefully they're being fixed soon.Overall, NT is an excellent game which follows a tenant I hold dear: ""It's okay to do only one thing, as long as you do that one thing spectacularly."" NT is the same thing over and over again at its very core, but that one thing is so satisfying and JUST varied enough in its own ways that it has a lot of replay value. It tests your skill without being unfairly difficult, it offers responsive and very fast-paced gameplay, and it's everything you probably want from a shooter like this.I would strongly suggest it.

Early Access Review
								Please note that this is a spoiler free review; no story elements, secrets or special weapons are spoiled.GAMEPLAYNuclear Throne is a top-down shooter, in which you control a mutant (or a fugitive running from the popo), with the goal of killing everything in sight, and finishing your journey to the fabled Nuclear Throne. In your task, you are aided by a metric ton of possible weapons, ranging from revolvers, all the way to nuke launchers, and anything in between. Generally, if you can imagine it, it's there. To those favoring a more hack and slash gameplay style, melee weapons are also present.The character you pick will influence your playstyle significantly, as each of them brings an active, and a passive ability to the table. Currently there are 12 characters in the game, with 6 unlocked from the start. Five of the six starting characters are easy to pick up and play in terms of mechanics: - Fish collects more ammo, and, as the loading screen kindly tells you a million times, ""Fish can roll"".- Crystal starts with 10 HP instead of 8, and has the ability to encase herself in a hunk of crystal, reflecting shots- Y.V. (Yung Venuz), the Gun God himself, has a faster rate of fire than the rest. His active ability is firing his weapon twice, with double the cooldown (affected by the fire rate reduction). He can also press B to airhorn, which should be a core feature in every game.- Steroid has no active ability; instead, his passive allows him to fire two weapons at the same time, in exchange for worse accuracy.- Chicken starts with a sword, instead of the usual Revolver. Her passive allows her to survive a lethal hit, by literally running around like a headless chicken. If she picks up health from any source, she'll survive, and take a -1 max HP penalty. She can also throw weapons Hotline Miami style, which is extremely effective in the early game.Every stage, your main task is to blow everything the Hell up, and collect whatever you can to help you do that on future stages; radiation canisters (this game's experience equivalent), weapons, ammunition, medkits, and so on. Once you kill everything, a portal spawns near the corpse of your last slain enemy, and starts dragging you in. Enter, and you're whisked away to the next stage. (Possibly a secret area.. If you found one of them!)If you've collected enough canisters to level up, you can choose one of four random mutations. All of these mutations are a large boon, that'll help you both short and longterm. There's quite the variety as well; each weapon category has it's own related mutation (example: Bolt Marrow apparently replaces your bone marrow with crossbow bolts [don't even ask how that's possible], causing your bolts to have slight homing capabilities; Laser Brain amps up the damage of your energy weapons, Long Arms increases your melee swing range, etc), as well as several more 'generic' ones (such as Second Stomach, which doubles the health you get from medkits, Rabbit Paw, which causes more items to drop, etc). The mutations are varied, and powerful enough, that you have to make tough decisions when leveling up, however, there's not so many of them, that you can't aim for a specific playstyle.I didn't talk much about the actual combat itself - that's because there's not much to talk about. It's extremely simple, however, that is a compliment in this case. The game is a perfect example of the expression ""elegance in simplicty"", as the game's narrow focus means that the action is fast-paced, exciting, and extremely hectic. Patterns are predictable, however, the sheer number of enemies you fight at times, coupled with the fact that you NEED to collect those radiation canisters means that you're constantly making life and death decisions, on the fly, under a split-second. Hesitate, and you can either lose out on an advantage you desperately need, or die. The weapons are, for the most part, satisfying to use, and most importantly, consistent.One interesting thing is that guns themselves don't vary much in terms of raw damage output. A basic Shotgun deals the exact same damage per pellet as higher tier ones, a Revolver does the same damage per shot as a Minigun does, and so on (There are exceptions to this, however); thanks to this, even if you've never picked up a weapon, you generally have a very good idea on how much damage it'll actually do to whatever you point it at. Upgrades still feel extremely satisfying, however; despite the ammunition itself dealing the same damage, the overall damage output always increases significantly. You will have to combat the increased ammo consumption, but generally your mutations tend to help out with that.Every third level, you will face a level boss. They will not be spoiled.Rinse, repeat, until you reach the Nuclear Throne.GRAPHICSSimplistic. However, it is extremely charming. If you're not a fan of sprite-based graphics, look elsewhere. If you are into it, you'll dig the sprites in some cases; the mutants themselves are rather creative, and the enemy design is okay at worst, and ""HOLY ♥♥♥♥ WHAT IS THAT"" at best. My personal favorite pieces of the art in this game are, funnily enough, shown in the first few seconds of the game: the character select screen. You get to watch your cast of mutants lounging around a campfire, doing their own thing (amusingly, their locations on the screen are randomly generated, too); selecting them results in a fighting game style character overlay. It's quite charming.SOUND AND MUSIC DESIGNNo shooty-shooty-bang-bang game is complete without sounds, and tunes. The gun sound effects are actually surprisingly good. The audio feedback is excellent; even your starting weapon, the Revolver, sounds satisfying to use, higher tier weapons sound sufficiently devastating. It's a hard one to talk about without hearing the audio itself, so I apologize if the description is generic. Special mention goes to the sound effects you hear when you select a mutation - each of them have an associated sound clip, that's meant to represent the changes your mutant is undergoing.The music... Oh, man, where do I even begin.Personally, I'm infatuated with what the devs put on the table - or at least the idea of what they were trying to do. I sincerely recommend looking up the soundtrack on YouTube if you plan to read the rest of this section, as none of what I'll say make sense without.The main theme itself is one of the most enchanting pieces I've ever heard in a game of this type. It's atmospheric, and it sets the mood perfectly well.However, the audio quality drops massively when you actually enter the game; while the tunes themselves are extremely catchy, and complement the game perfectly, it is hamstrung by the low fidelity of it; synthetized, grainy sounding drums, generic, MIDI-sounding choirs. The guitar tracks, which are the only thing that sounds legitimately recorded, is excellent.It's an interesting design choice that they chose all three bossfights to have the same main motif, with alterations on the track to more accurately represent the boss and the zone you fight them in. A nice touch.I sincerely hope that they'll re-do the soundtrack before release, and pay someone to record a real drum track, as it's a huge flaw. Still extremely enjoyable despite that, if you're not an audiophile.VERDICTIf you couldn't tell by now, I'll spell it out for you: despite some of it's flaws, I ADORE this title. I've written this review after 25 hours, and I just can't stop playing it, no matter how many times I see the words: YOU HAVE NOT REACHED THE NUCLEAR THRONE.It's one of the most polished Early Access titles; for $12, you'll get a lot of value out of your money, if you're into this type of game. The dev support for the game is great, they DO listen to feedback, and it shows.If this is your jam; buy it.			"

												Incredibly addictive, action packed and fun game! Great job from developers who know how early access should look like. Game feels like it is finished already (at least for me).

Definitely a game that will keep you occupied with step by step progress and feeling of achievement after completing levels and beating our nemesis.

Early Access Review
								I'm reluctant to purchase early access titles due to the rampant abuse of greenlight - you know the story. But with a reputable developer like Vlambeer, who have delivered games that feel like, well, actual games, I was pretty sure I would get my moneys worth. And if I were to stop playing the game now, it still would have made it worth the purchase. Luckily, Vlambeer has been consistently updating the game on an (almost always) weekly basis with new content being added all the time. They take criticism to heart and listen to the players. The action roguelite gameplay allows for a variety of gameplay styles within the somewhat limited top-down shooter style, but a variety of ""Mutations""(that function like perks which alter your statistics, abilities and expands and also limits how you play) which you are given the choice between when you level up can dramatically alter your plans. Even if you decided on a ""melee"" character, the selection of mutations you are given as you level up might not cater to that playstyle at all, nor might you get the preferred weapons for how you intended to play in the first place, so the game is dynamic and spontaneous in that it can crash your plans and force you to re-consider your strategy throughout your game.Permadeath keeps you at your toes. You can forget about checkpoints. This is good because modern games are plagued with these and they make your actions have less consequences. Vlambeer brings back the thrill of old school gaming, and the high-risk/high-reward mechanics is something that draws people to roguelites.Now to the negatives.There are balancing issues in the game, sometimes game breaking generation parameters that can give you a seemingly impossible spawn. This has been heavily debated on the forums. This is an obvious problem area when you combine a bullet-hell shooter with a randomly generated roguelite, but Vlambeer have taken the criticism to heart and have improved on the generation parameters throughout the game development and continue to do so consistently.There are also the obvious limitations and confines of the gamemaker engine, which Vlambeer insists on using. The game is locked to 30fps which is downright horrible on the eyes for extended playing sessions. The slideshow effect and clumsiness of this low a framerate is very detrimental to a genre that requires the player to be observant and react quickly. What makes it problematic for gamemaker creators to increase the framerate is that a lot of events are executed per-frame through the step event. This basically means that the devs have to re-write every part of the code that utilizes the step event and change it if the game was to run at, say 60fps. It is a shame that on a dynamic platform like the PC that a game is locked to perform like that.There are also balancing issues between characters. Vlambeer seem stubborn on keeping some characters underpowered(Fish being the number one example) because they insist on keeping useless active abilities that nobody actually finds useful which becomes ridiculously underpowered in comparison to other characters abilities. At one point, some characters were ridiculously overpowered, like Rebel and Chicken. They were both nerfed, which somehow changed completely the way people play and sort of took away the novelty and personality of said characters. But I must add that criticism like this is aimed at something that takes time to perfect and that there is no one right answer to. You always give some and lose some with such decisions. To sum it up, I have gotten my moneys worth at least two times over and I intend to also purchase the game again for the PS4 platform, even with the negatives mentioned because the game is still very fun to play. The game keeps becoming more polished and new features are always added, so I am confident that the game will be great at release. It's just a shame about the framerate. I think it's important to know that a game is locked to 30fps before purchasing.			"

								Nuclear Throne is a great fast-pased action isometric/twinstick shooter featuring 12 (and soon to be more) unique characters to choose from. Each character offers a different and fun play style so you can play the game to what suits you best, if you wish to have a insane rate of fire, or blow everything up on the screen with one click of a button, it's all up to you.GameplayNuclear Throne features randomly generated levels spanning over 7 areas, most of which feature a boss, with the final goal of reaching the fabled Nuclear Throne. The game is a mix of rougelike, action, and bullet hell, providing an exciting journey for all players.FeaturesNuclear Throne features hundreds of different guns of all different types, these are also randomly generated making every run different from the last. The game also features dozens of mutations for your characters, these work as permanent power-ups granted upon collecting enough radiation to level up. You will need mutations on your quest as the game gets progressively more difficult. Felling a bit competitive? Nuclear Throne offers a ""Daily Run"" system that gives all players in the world the same level seed and seeing who can achieve the highest score (counted by kills). This system will also be reworked to offer different styles of competition such as speed and distance.ConclusionNuclear Throne offers you hundreds maybe even thousands of hours of fun and anger, and is the one early access game that i've seen the most production on, getting massive bug fixes, tweaks, and content patches EVERY week. I cannot recomment this game enough. "

												Nuclear Throne is an action packed roguelike developed by Vlambeer that takes place in the apocalyptic future. You find yourself playing as one of 12 mutants fighting to stay alive long enough to reach the fabled Nuclear Throne, a device that is said to be able to revert the world to what it once was. This game is sure to keep you hooked in a love/hate relationship with its frustrating but rewarding gameplay, many characters that offer a different style of playing each, variety of weapons (over 100 in total,) and seven playable areas with many other secret areas to discover.Pros:-Beautiful art drawn by Paul Veer-Music that captures the mood and environment perfectly by Jukio Kallio-Addicting and challenging gameplay-12 different characters that allow for a different gameplay experience every time.-Over 100 different weapons that are satisfying and fun to use. Ranging from a simple Revolver to a Double Minigun and a Super Plasma Cannon-A wide variety of enemies that are sure to test your worthiness of the Throne-Cooperative gameplay: local and a fantastic mod that allows you to play online with a friend developed by YellowAfterlifeCons:-The game is locked to 30FPS-It is also drawn at a 4:3 aspect ratio because it ""prefers vertical movement"" It doesn't, the developers dropped the ball on this one-Some aspects and enemies are a tad too challenging for a game that plays at 4:3-The developers have stated it will never go on sale. Even for its low price, sometimes I feel as if it isn't worth the price-Infrequent updates: The developers often delay updates for months, the most recent of which has been delayed 307 days since its announcement (as of Nov. 23, 2016)After all is said and done, I feel Nuclear Throne is an excellent game overall, but no game is without its flaws, especially this one; but I would certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a challenge.

Early Access Review
								After playing a bit more of this, I can honestly say that this game is fun. It's a run-and-gun rpg bullet hell roguelike shoot-em-up from my own backyard (because Holland is about the size of a typical backyard). There are many aspects to making a game, and all of those (or at least most) have to be met in order for a game to be truly good. This game does just that. It takes every single one of my conditions for a good game and fills them in. Twice. Actually, I have two sets of conditions for the only two types of games that can ever be truly amazing: story-driven open world and hard-core skill & reflex fest. And it must also not be Call of Duty because that game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks balls. Anyway, this game falls into the second category, and let me explain what my criteria are and how it completely shreks the hell outta them. Unlike Call of Duty.Enemies. Any self-respecting game needs tons of varied enemies to keep things interesting and to make a natural transition to more difficult gameplay. Don't just add lvl. 44 to your opponent and give him more health and damage, make a new one! With different attack plans, weapons, health and speed. That's how you justify harder enemies, not by giving him a higer number. This game gets that, and every stage has it's own set of mortifying enemies that are designed especially to work on every nerve in your body. It's annoying to have to get to learn every opponent by dying from them first, but that's how it works. Nothing in life ever goes well on the first try. Except Call of Duty that stupid half-♥♥♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥! Ah that game is really getting on my nerves hrrrrrgghhh...Difficulty. In order for a game to actually be satisfying it has to be hard. Have you ever felt proud after you have eaten a banana? No? Wanna know why not? Because even a monkey could do it. It's not hard, it's not special, anyone could do it. Just like beating Call of Duty. It's not rewarding to do something anyone could do, it's only rewarding when you put time and effort into it. When you have thought about that glorious moment of opening a banana every second for the past 4 months of pure struggling. When you have longed for the taste of a banana for all that time. That's when eating a banana feels good, and that's what REAL men go for. And that struggle is exactly what makes Nuclear Throne rewarding to loop. That's right, Nuclear Throne is in fact unbeatable, for it has no end.Weapons. Preferrably of varied rarerity. A good selection of guns, of which at least a few hard to get, makes any game more enjoyable. It is necessary in games that are intended for replay, since playing the same game over and over again requires at least some aspect of variety. Hence the perks, random levels and tons of weapons. It's all there to keep you, the paying consumer, indulged in the game so that you'll tell your friends how cool it is and they would buy it too. Variety is the spice of life, they say, and I think the best example of that is having lots of guns in a run-and-gun rpg bullet hell roguelike shoot-em-up type of game.A good game also requires some type of milestones to help players remember that they ARE making progress! In this game that is done with levels and bosses. Anytime you beat one, you will know again that you have become better, encouraging you to play some more (and tell your friends about it)!Furthermore, under no circumstance should a good game ever be Call of Duty. Fortunately, this game is in fact NOT Call of Duty, and therefore meets this condition.I would have a few more criteria, but I think those speak for themselves. Anyway, there you have it, a great game and the reasons why! I do encourage you to go out and buy this game, even though it is not finished yet. It is already immense fun and more than worth your while and money.			"

												Would I recommend this game? Absolutely, if you would like a shooter game that has a lot of character and a lot of replayability. It has a lot of playable characters that can drastically alter how you play, and tons of weapons you can try, a lot of which are fun.However that recommendation comes with some caveats, as this is not an entirely fair or skill-based game. It's better at it than say, Binding of Isaac, but you are still going to suffer a lot of cheap deaths. Things exploding on you, guys charging in from off-screen, or just getting bad weapons or bad spawns (I'm aware Hammerhead is a thing, but I feel if you need a specific perk to show up to counteract a situation, that's still a flaw even if there's a fix for it - plus there are still enemies that don't really much about what cover you have). The game's not entirely balanced, either. There's weapons you wouldn't want to use, like the Toxic weapons, which are impractical and can hurt you since there's no way to negate toxic damage, or the Screwdriver, by far the worst melee weapon in the game which is only useful for one secret; seeing it drop after you can get that secret feels like a joke on you. It also feels like there's a big disparity in mutations, as well, since there are ones like Boiling Veins, which protects you from dying to explosions (and this game has a LOT of explosions), and Strong Spirit, which gives you a mulligan from death once per stage; really practical things as you go through the game. Then there's say, Lucky Shot, which can give you ammo of a random type when you kill an enemy - except that you usually won't find yourself switching weapons all that often, and the game tends to naturally drop ammo for stuff you don't have anyway. Or Extra Feet, which makes you faster (something one of the character does already), and negates the effect of terrain...but there are only instances of that in two areas, one of which is only a single stage long. I understand this is meant to encourage different builds, but there's a good reason some of these are considered 'core' mutations and others aren't.I should say this isn't the case for the characters, though, as every one of them feels distinct and appeals to a different kind of player. You want to be good on Ammo, pick Fish. You want to be careful, Crystal or Eyes. Pure damage? Steroids or YV. Want the game to abuse you like a dog? Go Melting.I don't know how many of the reviews bring this up, but I also love the game's sound. Pretty much every enemy has a bunch of unique soundbytes for attacks they use, which is helpful for reacting, as well as when they die, which is useful for knowing when you've killed something offscreen (and is also immensely satisfying for several foes - looking at you, Lil' Hunter). This isn't always foolproof though, as sometimes a bunch of sounds can happen at the same time. I hope I haven't implied I dislike the game by criticizing it, because if I genuinely didn't like it I wouldn't have played as long as I have. It's a great game. But playing it is pretty much tough love, and you'll need to keep that in mind a lot.			"

								This is possibly the best bullet-hell roguelike I have played in my life. The weekly updates keep adding more and more playability and fun as well as the game itself being incredibly polished and fun to play. The fact that this game is in early access and is more complete than some other games is astounding and amazing about this game. I would recommend this to anyone who loves roguelike games or video games in general.I also recommend this to people who like dying to assassins or policemen. A lot. Like, every run. ;D			"

												So far, Nuclear Throne is the greatest Rogue-Like game ever made. The best thing about this game is the gameplay. Games are supposed to be extremely fun because of their gameplay not graphics. Nuclear Throne is a great example of that. Its gameplay is really smooth and easy to follow with, which the Binding of Isaac did not have. The controls are absolutely brilliant and made me feel like I am in complete control of my movements and weapons. The number of guns to choose is absolute freakin' insane! There are a lot of characters to choose from with different perks which provide a lot of insane replayability value. Oh and man... The explosions. The explosions are so satisfying.This is one of the perfect examples of how Early Access games should be handled. The devs worked really hard and updated the game often and listened to the community. Huge props to the devs. Well done. Overall, the game is a masterpiece for its gameplay and is absolutely addicting. I am a harsh reviewer and I decided to give this game a 9.5 out of 10 which will place this game at 6th place into my ""Steam HALL of FAME"" list where only 15 games have obtained at least a 9 or greater so far. I have been gaming on Steam for 7 years and that's a big deal. Buy this game. You won't be disappointed.9.5 out of 10			"

												Don't let yourself get fooled by the bright blue thumb up, this game is/was a wild train-ride which ended in a crash. Pun intended.(If U99/U100 fixes ♥♥♥♥, Ill update this review.)>>Emotional backstory, if you wanna read the review, scroll down.<<You put a certain level of trust in a dev when you buy an early access game, and honestly, I thought that trust I put into Nuclear Throne and Vlambeer was well put with what they did. They communicated with the community, they did weekly dev streams and weekly updates. You really felt like you were part of the development. I have never seen any other devs do the entire early access thing this good, and to this date I hope for it to eventually be the standard.Nearing the end of 2015, it all started to get downhill. Several issues addressed by a lot of players back then were said to be fixed ""in the polishing phase"" - right now, we had the ""feature and content phase"" - so balance, bugs, crashes etc. were to be fixed by then. The problem was that the so called ""polishing phase"" never really came alongside of other expectations raised by the dev, like full-seeding-support, or other things, like balance-overhauls of areas and other things. There was an insane amount of potential for Nuclear Throne, and the community reported and helped the devs more than enough to make the fullest out of that potential.Not saying they didn't do anything, though,  there was a certain level of polish done, some bugs were fixed, some details like ravens leaving feathers added. Major crashes, some people literally being unable to play the game and other bugs though? Completely ignored. I didn't mind back then, since the game was in early access - and its completely acceptable for a game in early access to have crashes and bugs, since you know.An early access game can have bugs and crashes, since its unfinished. A released game however says that the game is done - little bugs and crashes are supposed to be there.So, around the end of 2015, the devs further and further pushed to release, constantly threw the sentence ""we are almost done guys!"" - which was followed by an insane amount of negativity by the community. Understandably, since, as I already said, there were tons of bugs, crashes and balance issues still to be fixed. No way they'll release the game like that - that's atleast what I thought, since I still trusted Vlambeer in their decision.Until the shocking date of the 5th December - around 5 months have passed since the release. Remember that number, it'll become relevant later. That is when they announced the release of the game for both the PC and consoles, and that is when people started loosing their ♥♥♥♥. The extremely negative stigma and feeling of disappointment really got onto some people, understandably, since the game is in a broken state.""uhh buddy, ya sure you didn't mean ""back then"" ? - I mean, 5 months have passed, s-surely they fi - ""Nope. Some people still cant play the game, several people still crash, and people still get a frozen screen.This is not me complaining about the broken balance of the game (which you have lots of) - but me complaining about a game said to be ""released"" to have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs and crashes. I'm not overreacting either, you have lots of jokesters saying ""B-but, it isnt that bad!"" - It is that bad - Hell, one of the main reasons I stopped doing Dailies is because 30% of my daily runs end in a freeze, followed up with a death screen.And don't let me get started on the console version of the game, that version has its own set of issues like the player not being able to select their starting weapon, crown or skin - btw, these people have not even received both of the tiny updates which fixed maybe 5% of the issues available - reminder, 5 months have passed.--- And the ride is still going for both the PC Version and the console version. Both versions are still screwed, and while the changelog of Update 99 looks pretty, it's already sad that it takes over 5 months to fix insane issues.I'll put it like STAR_, an ex-Nuclear Throne Streamer said it when he streamed the game after a long pause : ""Game was more stable and better 3 months ago.""------------------------------Now, the game ; Let's talk about the game, the main thing you are here I'll assume.Pros: - Fluid Controls and Game-feel.- Wide selection of Weapons.- Lots of Characters and combinations to try out.- Dailies and Weeklies (Runs where everyone has the ""same Seed"" (<- Not really since Seeds are broken.) which end up with your score (Right now : Kills.) being submitted to a leaderboard and www.thronebutt.com )  add extra replayability and competition which encourages improvement.- Sound effects are tastier than Guy Fieri's hottest hits.Neutral:- Mediocre amount of perks upon leveling up + them not being really balanced leaves up for a very limited amount of viable perks, thus runs end up feeling the same.- Pixel art tastes differently in everyone's mouth, while I like it most of it, I wouldnt call it amazing.- Same goes for the Music. It's good if you'd ask me, but nothing too amazing.- It's a difficult game. If you are a soft-bean which wants to be spoonfed, this isn't the game for you. Can and will likely get insanely frustrating.- While Roguelike elements are there, it is not enough to make the game not feel repetitive for most at the end.- Crowns (Gameplay modifiers) are the definition of missed potential.Negative: - 30 FPS.- No widescreen Support.- Several Bugs and crashes which have been reported several times are still not fixed. Some Features even unfinished.- Late-game and perk-balance is far from a good state.** This ♥♥♥♥ will have a lot of Spoilers about late-game, so if you wanna explore that yourself, lemme sum it up : Expect terrible balance of both enemies and weapons.I don't know what happened to the idea of Loops, I suppose it was rushed like the entire game was. Another thing pushed back to ""we'll do that later"" - only to be ended up half-♥♥♥♥♥. The main idea back then was ""Less-enemies, less randomness, more Elites! The Elites are the thing making the Loops hard, har har!"" - however that transformed into ""We can't be bothered to make more Elite enemies which is why we made 6 and then just added enemies out of secret areas and left the rest pretty much as it is""The Quality of the Elite enemies we got sunk and sunk until we got nothing, too. It first started with Elite IDPD, which were cool with their own unique sprites and attacks, but however came with frustrating Insta-kills, because apparently you can only make something hard if it instantly kills you. Anyways, from these, we went to Elite-Aligators, which also instantly killed the player upon being shot, and then we went to literally two deviantart-reskins, one of them being insanely weak. That's it. Some Areas literally don't have any Elite enemies.Oh, Vans too. Sometimes unavoidable, even.""But it's a single player game, why should balance matter in that?""Because it isn't a single player game. With the addition of online-leaderboards, the player is now going for ""the best"" - which ended up with a stale Daily meta of Melee, SPC, and CoB. Maybe 15% of the Weapons in the game are viable late-game with CoB. Instead of being about ""who is better at the game?"" - Dailies are now ""Who is better at the modified game?""Oh right, Perks. We have an insanely limited amount of Perks, or called, Mutations, which are also horribly balanced. There is a certain ""elite 10"" of mutations which are practically objectively better than the rest, the usual stale meta stuff which is part of why the game might get boring quickly and runs feel the same. This is a case where quantity and quality is low.TL:DR: Good game with huge issues which might ruin it for some.			"

 Positives  Addictive, entertaining, and keeps you coming back. Difficult and fast-paced. Randomly generated with seeds so you don't get an identical experience twice. Many different mutations (upgrades), characters, paths, and weapons to choose from. Nice soundtrack and art style. Negatives  Not enough updates anymore. A few bugs, some minor and others near run-ending (some actually crash)Overall- yes, I recommend the game, but I would not recommend it if you cannot adapt to game difficulty or aren't good at this style of game in general.

								Nuclear Throne feels really good to play. Instant, immediate fun. Pick a character, move, shoot, pick up new weapons, shoot again.I am usually not fond of top-down shooters, but Vlambeer completely nailed it. The feedback of the weapons is great (it is even possible to reflect shots). It is so much a pleasure to play that dying and trying again in the randomly-generated levels does not feel frustrating. Except for a few specific ways to be killed, like flames from some traps, and taking multiple hits from the same source because of a lack of 'invulnerability frames' after the first hit.Another great thing is that progress through the levels is quite fast, so deaths are not as disheartening as in other games. I don't even care about permadeath and reaching the end: I just want to shoot things and get as far as I can until I die. And try again, because I am having fun. There are official daily runs: a common level for everyone, refreshed each day, that can only be tried once. As often, players are ranked daily on leaderboards. This feature gives me a great incentive to play Nuclear Throne each day for at least a quick run (sometimes, really really quick, like less than a minute - yeah this game is not a walk in the park). Unlike The Binding of Isaac, in which I know that a single run can last for a long time and thus I am less inclined to launch it on a whim.Each character has different and original special skills that allow for a different gameplay, from minor variations to major differences. There is variety in the enemies and their way to attack, however since there are no alternate levels (there are many secret levels though), playing through the same starting area again and again can get a bit too familiar. The art is cute and the music is perfectly adequate. Only gripe here is that the framerate is locked to 30. An instant favorite to me.

												Nuclear Throne is a real Vlambeer gem. There's alot of detail found in every hole and around every dark corner this game consists of. After playing for a while, the game boils down to a science, things you do seem to just slot in to place with the game's agenda and it becomes almost systematic. The game is difficult, that's more than true, but you'll achieve such a rush in looping it compensates for the hardship you'll face trying to beat the Nuclear Throne for the first time. Also, you can definately feel the difference between the mutants you play as, each one has their own back-stories and reasons why they've wound up in this nightmare, and each of them want victory for different reasons, release, redemption, a show of weapon-weilding potency or the very taste of blood. Nuclear Throne's soundtrack is epic, it's as fast paced as the gameplay, it brilliantly suits this game and is one of my favourite OSTs out there. The assortment of guns, the bosses, the varied enemies and the unpredictability & variation are just some of the reasons Nuclear Throne is fantastic, it's a very worth-while price too, if you're considering it, watch the plethora of videos of the game on YouTube to get more of an understanding and a feel for it, but I, personally, would definately recommend picking it up.

								This might be the best top-down shooter I have played for a long time. The controls are so tight it's practically claustrophobic. Death - and thus the end of your run - is a constant nemesis, but it is always fair. You get a bit greedy for that XP or ammo or health, push out a bit too far and you are toast; your fault, pal.It boasts a huge variety of playable characters and ""mutations"" (bonuses that affect your character) so that each run feels suitably different and rewarding. Combine this with a fantastic soundtrack and appealingly chunky pixel art style and you have a real winner.Even though it is still in Early Access, it's basically finished now, so dip in!

												These are a few things to expect in this game, whether or not they throw you off or persuade you further to play decides whether or not this game is for you: This game is hard, no matter which way you spin it, but has the benefits of having a character for numerous play styles to give you more than 1 way to go at it. While RNG plays a part in it in terms of weapon drops and perks you can choose with each level, slow progression should be enough proof that these aren't the only factors. The first boss will kick your ♥♥♥ when you begin, and you'll be laughing him off after an hour or so. 80% of deaths will be your fault and your fault alone, 20% will be cheap deaths due to either where you spawned on the map, or the map itself. As of writing this review, the 3 top guides to help you can be pretty much summed up with ""get gud"", the community claiming most complaints about the game being due to a lack of skill. This game would definitely be for people who tanked their way through Binding of Isaac for days on end, and in a vague sense, Dark Souls aswell...its that frustrating, head-banging pleasure you get from succeeding after the 148th try.To sum it up, this game will taunt you endlessly as you play it, whether or not you're the type to quickly give up and play something actually fun, or if you're the type who is only driven to play it more, will decide on if this games for you.

												( Update 95)I seriously thought I'd never see the day Nuclear Throne came out of early access, but here we are after two years of constant weekly updates and support from the developers.I won't go into detail about how well they handled the early access system because that doesn't really determine the value of the finished game, but the devs are some of the best when it comes to talking to their community and being completely open about the development of Nuclear Throne, including regular streams that allows people to watch the devs do their thing. It's a wonderful example of how well early access can be used to create the best game possible, and I hope future titles learn from Vlambeers success.Anyways, the game as it stands now:ProsExtremely difficult, yet rewarding.12 (+2 secret) characters,all with unique playstyles and mechanics. Some are very basic to learn, while others are more suited for advanced players. Over 100 weapons. I felt like making the weapons aspect of this review larger because of how varied they are, but I'll just say this to sum it up: Super Bazooka. Daily and Weekly runs give the game a competitive aspect. The daily system is currently broken as of writing this review, however I'll update it when it is fixed. If the daily runs are the reason you may be wanting to buy NT, I'd wait for a while until it gets fixed.Quite possibly my favorite soundtrack of the year.Gorgeous artwork which really helps make the NT universe come to life. Yung Venuz Cons: There is currently a lot of bugs in the game. Some of these are very minor texture glitches while some completey render the game unplayable on some systems. Like I said above, the developers are very much aware of these and are working on fixes right now, but I might suggest waiting until the next update comes around. This is a very controversial subject in the NT community, but keep in mind that the game is capped at 30 FPS. In my honest opinion I find this to be completely okay, and I'm usually picky when it comes to FPS issues in games. But NT is designed around 30 fps and doesn't suffer from any of the usual issues.  There are some balancing issues when it comes to a secret aspect of the game after the final boss. The devs are aware of this however, and are gonna tone down some of the unfair aspects of it. Easily my game of the year, It's been a fantastic experience watching this game grow into one of the best rouge-likes of all time. My conclusion would be to wait until a future update, but if you have a need for a new rouge-like/lite, seriously don't hesistate in buying this. 200 hours in and I'm still having a blast killing various monsters with super flak cannons.

Is not recommended for a short play, has lots of replayability and should be *given* that replaying. Progress is slow, but gameplay is difficult and engaging.

Early Access Review
								YES. I just love the game. The game runs smoothly even on my trash computer, and gameplay is exciting and never lets up. There's something for eveyone. Daily and weekly runs allow for competive play, and for the casuals, doing a bunch of regular runs is really fun. I guess my only complaint is that there's not really any difficulty curve for the noobier players. The only way to get better is to practice. Sure, you could unlock new characters, but the characters are pretty much balanced (and that's a good thing), and not one is so much better than the others that you're never gonna play the other ones again. Perhaps adding unlockable guns would be a good way to help the noobier players along (like me). But that's just my opinion. I'm not a game designer, so I wouldn't know about the techinical aspects of the power curve and other things that come along with adding new characters and features.Anyway, Great game. Buy it. Now. And then play it.(not really much point in buying it if you don't play it)			"

TL;DR: FAST, DIFFICULT AND FUN AS HELL SHOOTER WITH A LOT OF UNLOCKS AND SECRETS. BUY IT IT'S AMAZINGOh boy where do I start with this game?Let me tell you, this game is HARDCORE. You know Dark Souls? You play Dark Souls to relax after playing Nuclear Throne, that's how hardcore it is. You start out playing Nuclear Throne and you're like ""yeah, whatever, some shooter or somethin', I guess this is a little fun"". But then you die. Over and over again you die, and start getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at how bad you are at this, and force yourself to get better. As you progress, you start noticing that this little harmless shooter was not as shallow as it first seemed. It it DEEP, it has SO MANY THINGS in it. Guns, enemies, maps, bosses, secret little things to do and unlock that make you go into a secret-seeking frenzy. You think you're done when, after countless hours, you beat the final boss? Psh, you haven't seen ANYTHING yet. This is the kind of game that you have to experience for yourself, so I'm not going to spoil anything. I only recommend that you try playing this along with friends if you're not into searching for secrets on the internet, they might find something you overlooked and vice-versa. Now, for the Pros and Cons section of this review:THE GOOD: Fast, fun and addicting gameplay; Huge variety of weapons; Level-ups and upgrades that are actually meaningful and useful; Plenty of characters with different and unique abilities to choose from;  Unique theme with characters that grow on you despite speaking their own bizarre language; A bunch of sometimes extremely difficult to find secrets; Unlocks that challenge you in innovative ways to improve your playstyle; Runs go by quickly and allow for fast gameplays during breaks at work, school, or anything else; A ton of other stuff and tiny amazing details that you notice as you play.THE BAD: Certain deaths feel very unfair and frustrating; Sometimes, as with any game of the genre, RNG lets you down; The difficulty in gameplay and in uncovering some secrets may push certain people away before they can truly enjoy the experience.THE VERDICT:This game is absolute must-play. If, after giving it a real and long try, you end up not liking it, so be it. Chances are, though, if you're a fan of roguelikes, shooters or just FUN GAMES, you'll most likely love this one. Its price may seem a little too high from someone who hasn't played it yet, as it seems like any other indie shooter, but the level of detail and content in this game way surpasses that price-point. Not to mention the countless hours you'll spend playing (and dying on) this game. Buy it, try it and, hopefully, love it.			"

Early Access Review
								A punishing roguelike shooter with a surprising amount of nuanced gameplay. You play as one of several mutants in a post-apocalyptic setting. Your goal is to fight through throngs of enemies until you reach the Nuclear Throne. Along the way, you'll pick up different weapons and XP in the form of radiation. Each level you earn, you can choose a new mutation that helps you progress through the game.It sounds simple enough, and the basic jist of gameplay is. If you shoot things and don't get hit, you win. That's much easier said than done, though, especially as you spawn into levels randomly--something surrounded by enemies. Many times you'll have to go in guns blazing and run for cover. Others you'll weave in and out of bullet sprays while popping off a few well-aimed shots of your own. It's challenging and engaging, even in level 1-1. And that's a good thing, because you'll find yourself back there a lot.I thought this game would frustrate me, but so far I've had a smile on my face every time I've died. It's such a fun game that the only thing keeping me from hitting R to do a quick restart is other commitments.If roguelikes are your thing and you're a fan of punishing games, give it a whirl. Even though it's EA, it's extremely polished thus far and the develop updates it frequently.			"

												EARLY ACCESS IS OVER !!!!! WAAAAAT YESSSS""more serious review on bottom""Nulcear throne is a very fast paced, bullet hell, Rogue-like action game thats brings a whole new meaning to the word "" Difficult "" I am completely satisfied by the game's early access adventure they came a long way from the beginning and all the updates we have now is more reasons to support this game.I still remember when I first got this game, had a lot of bugs so much missing stuff, but now ? SECRET levels, improved characters and improved art and improved everything You choose from 12 characters ""That you can unlock as you progress in the game""and fight hordes and hordes of monsters with a HUGE Selection of weapons, ""Seriously check the wiki DAMN""Each stage has 3 levels , goes like , 1-1 , 1-2, 1-3 ..etc and every 3 stages theres a ""dark"" one which sort of reminds me of the 2nd level in mario sort of I don't know I'm weird.Each character has its own passive and active abilities, making each one different from the other.You can carry 2 weapons at a time, switching between them for the ultimate hell shooter action.There are several boss fights in the game which introduces even more fun that it already gives, after beating the final level you can end the game for a story or do loops *cough*mario*cough"" That goes on until you die, however loops are INSANE, you get an extra special abilities to pick from and the monsters are ... holy S***.The game has its own secrets, secret levels and easter eggs/reference whatever you'd call it and Im hoping they'd add more because its so good.Trust me when I say the game is hard its HARD but you'd get used to how fast it is, you'd get a bit frustrated at first on how suddenly BOOM you died WTF ? but then you'd get a clue on what to do and how to do it properly and you can follow some steam guides they're helpful.ACHIEVEMENTS ! The game didn't have this at first so I got really excited when they got finally implemented, although the achievements are not as much as you'd hope but they're HELLAhard to get.The soundtrack in the game is so good, this retro feel it gives me I love it. All the sound effects all the levels and their designs and characters are outstanding I cannot find the proper words to describe it so i'll make up a word ""AWESOMARITYFEEEK"" ...that didn't go well.You got daily challenges, you got weekly challenges, you got to do certain things to unlock other characters, you'll just keep killing monsters along the way as a way of life.Some people would get shot off by the fact that this game is locked on 30fps but it can never be fixed and devs admitted it was a ""Poor developing choice"" but thats ok since after 1 hour of the game you'll forget all that and get sucked into this endless wormhole of AWESOMEIRTYFEEEK TLDR One of the best twin-stick shooters I played ""after boi"", the difficulty and the content this game provides is insane10/10 the best early access game I backed.

 Nuclear Throne Review  ''One of the best indie games currently available on steam.''  Summary: In a world where indie games are becoming an important part of the video game industry, it is hard to find a worthwhile indie gem which gives you a bang for your buck. Search no more. If you are a fan of shooting games, rogue-like games, 2d games or bloody good games, then Vlambeers' Nuclear Throne is the game you need in your library. This top-down shooter is perfectly designed and suitable for alot of type of players. The hard, solid gameplay aswell as the endless replayability of this title will let you stack hours upon hours of fun. On a more personal note, this game is one of my favorites of all time. It is truly unbelievable.. The Good's and The Bad's  The goods  Incredible replayability A varied and enjoyable roster of characters Tons of crazy guns Weekly updates Alot of ennemies A huge number of secrets Action-packed fun Local Co-op Very neat design The bads  Some may find it a little too hard Score and closing line  9.5: Outstanding.  ''Vlambeers delivers an ambitious indie game that sets a new standard in gaming.''  "

												Nuclear Throne is a fun and frantic top-down shooter rogue-lite in which you must defeat the Nuclear Throne with any of its interesting characters and multitude of weapons however it's rife with game ending problems at the moment.Pros + Frantic top-down action shooter rogue-lite.+ Multiple characters each with a unique active ability and ultra-mutations. If one doesn't fit your play style, simply choose another.+ Fun mutation system, sometimes you get ones you don't want but have to make it work.+ Interesting to infuriating enemies (I'm looking at you scorpions, rats, flame traps and green ooze exploder).+ Multitude of weaponry, some good, some bad, some great and some awful.+ Daily and Weekly Challenges ideas are great.+ Crown system for run manipulation.Cons - The game is prone to the occasional crash.- Still has a lot of bugs that should've been fixed before release, but alas the devs had to honour a contractual agreement on PSX and it would've seemed strange that it released on platform and not the other I guess.- Base weapon RNG is just terrible. The frequency at which you get duplicate weapons is way too high (but then again it's random).- Level generation leaves A LOT to be desired. Sometimes it's good and other times you get swarmed with no way out. The player should always spawn in a safe location and not right next to enemies as it currently does as this often leads to panic and death.- Some boss fights rely on your initial spawn namely Raven\Assassin + Sniper infested Big Dog fight and Tank + Snow Bot\Yeti Lil' Hunter fight.- Most Crowns seem rather pointless or worthless as they make your run worse with no added benefits.- The Daily Challenge is not really fair or balanced as players can choose whichever character to play as and certain characters are just better overall. Secret levels, big weapons chest and leveling right before a level has a tendency of changing the seed resulting in a modified level generation. Crowns especially Crown of Blood can have an unfair advantage on score (but this is more like Ghosting in Spelunky so I'm not too peeved about it, if you're good enough to do it then do it).- Speaking of Daily and Weekly Challenges, their leader boards have been broken since release. I know the devs are working on it but it should've been ready at launch.- Hard Mode is just terrible and not fun. The game basically starts on Loop 1, 1-1 and the player is given a big weapons chest at the start which contains 'beginning tier' weapons to deal with  swarms of enemies. I get that Hard Mode was put in as a joke but that is most certainly not how you do hard mode.Irritations - Each character starts off with the same gear, a pistol except Chicken and Rogue. Even though you can unlock golden weapons to start off with, I'd have liked if each character had a different base starting weapon.- Enemies know your position as you spawn even without line of sight and often shoot at you from off-screen.- Enemy AI is too inconsistent at times; Bandits will often look at you and shoot backwards or vice-versa. Yeti bots can be stuck in their charge state for a very long time often gliding across the levels. Snow dogs can be stuck in their shoot pattern for far too long. IDPD inspectors often shoot their shots at you even though you are far beyond thier reach.- The game is unbalanced as a result of some changes made during the Early Access phase and too often the difficulty of situations feel cheap as it was beyond the player's control.- Looping is a mess; prepared to be swarmed by flies, scorpions, snipers and\or assassins unless you have a powerful weapon or skill.- I feel the game relies too heavily on RNG this is seen clearly with the seed generation and weapon drops the for Daily and Weekly Challenges.- Tiered weapon distribution needs some work still. At 'late game' pre-loop, you shouldn't even be given 'beginning tier' weapons any more or rather they should drop less in my opinion.- You tell me to avoid weapons chests and when I do you give me 2 wrenches and a low tier bullet weapon mid game. What kind of rubbish is that?- Secret levels aren't really interesting to be honest. I wish there were unique weapons you could only attain on those levels like how it was done in Spelunky.- It makes no sense to me why the player is the only one affected by Flame Trap in the Wasteland and Spider Webs in the Caves. Enemies should not be able to walk or run full speed on the webs except for the spiders and crystals.- I wish the scoring system used for the Daily\Weekly Challenge Leader board rankings relied on something more than just kills, something like a point system for instance.* Points based on enemy types (1pts - Maggot, 3pts - Big Maggot, 5pts - Bandit, 15pts - Scorpion, 30pts - Golden Scorpion etc.)* 1.0		- Loop 0 multiplier (increments by 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 2.0 etc.)* 100pts	- Per level, affected by the Loop Multiplier* 250pts	- Secret levels (multiples of 250)* 500pts	- Defeating bosses (multiples of 500)* 750pts	- Crown raid + taking crowns* 1000pts	- IDPD HQ raidVerdict  Nuclear Throne is an extremely enjoyable and frantic rogue-lite which requires your utmost attention as any wrong slip will result in your death. Sometimes you get a crap seed where you get murdered instantly, don't get the right mutations or weapons and other times you get all the right mutations and weapons and go on a murderous rampage. That feeling is exhilarating. However it was released with various bugs that should've been fixed while in Early Access and it unfortunately represents the first strike against Vlambeer's perfect or near perfect record. So can I recommend you buy this game, sadly no, not with all the issues currently surrounding it which is a shame as the game is really enjoyable. However, if you can overlook the Cons and Irritations and understand that you're purchasing an unfinished game then by all means go for it, otherwise it's best to wait a while until the bugs\issues are fixed.- Review Update: (2016-02-22 Update 98) -VerdictNuclear Throne is an extremely enjoyable and frantic rogue-lite which requires your utmost attention as any wrong slip will result in your death. Sometimes you get a crap seed where you get murdered instantly, don't get the right mutations or weapons and other times you get all the right mutations and weapons and go on a murderous rampage. That feeling is exhilarating. Although it was released in a broken manner, it seems Vlambeer was hard at work to fix all\most of what was broken and I'm happy to sasy that I'm glad they did.So can I recommend you buy this game now after Update 98, sadly still no. Don't get me wrong Update 98 fixed some things like the Daily\Weekly Challenges and some other issues but the game is still buggy and crashes from time to time for no reason.			"

												This, ladies and gents, is the most fun I've had with a twin-stick permadeath shooter since The Binding of Isaac. With a passionate community and a development team that went above and beyond to make this game into something truly wonderful with said community, this game is certainly the full package.  Everything from the music to the art has wonderful grit and polish, the setting of a hopeless post-apocalyptic wasteland never feeling so vibrant and varied. The controls are smoother than a babe's backside, the design is solid, and the pace frenetic. This is one of those games where a run could last anywhere from five seconds to forty five minutes, but every time the first thought that comes up when the death screen is encountered is, ""Let's have another go"". Nuclear Throne is as good as it gets for the marriage of well-designed weapons, varied characters, and a hard-as-nails bullet hell atmosphere that will hand you your own ♥♥♥ time and time again and leave you begging for more.

												Nuclear Throne it's the perfect blend between a Shoot 'em Up Bullet Hell, a Roguelike Top Down Shooter with some spice of RPG, featured bugs and an amazing soundtrack that will follow along with you and your journey of becoming the most badass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the block.The game itself is fast paced, but easy AND FUN to master, you have plenty of characters (Mutants) with their own passive and active abilities, from a blindfolded chicken with slowmo (since Update #76 Chicken now throws weapons and no longer has slowmo) and an anabolics-infused scientist that can dual wield to a fish that can roll, yes, that's right, Fish can roll. You level up by getting Radiation that is dropped from enemies and found in canisters around the levels, everytime you level up, you will be able to choose a power up (Mutation) when you finish a level. You start with a single weapon but can have 2 at any given time from over the 100 that the game has, they are found in chests and sometimes dropped by enemies and can be switched anytime, find your favourite combinations of Mutants, Mutations and Weapons and kill everything. Have fun.Update #60 Edit: Now it actually has over 100 guns.2016 Update: Many loops later this game is giving me PTSD, play at your own risk.			"

Update Since this review I've been hired to work for the company which made this game as a freelancer. This review was written way before I even thought of that, and I still do think that this is a great game, but I am obviously biased now and you should read another review if that bothers you. I haven't changed the original review, so here it is.Nuclear Throne is at the same time easy to pick up and detailed enough that you'll spend dozens of hours looking for various tricks, trying out different strategies, weapon matches, finding secret areas, and the most important thing - shooting mutants and rebels and fighting off the interdimensional police which is always on your tail. As a rougelike, it's not for the faint of heart - levels, the amount of enemies, weapons and mutations you get are always random and will differ each time you boot up the game. This allows you to replay the game as much as you like and it's always going to be just as great as the first time.There's no detailed unlock systems which force you to invest hundreds of hours into the game to get the full experience. Almost all characters and all weapons will be available after your first playthrough. Pick up someone with the pleasant name and go. Feel like having an all-out powerful run where you can blow up corpses of your enemies? Go ahead. Feel like casually strolling through the wasteland with your allies? Go ahead. Feel like having a frantic experience where the game randomly throws enemies at you when it feels like it? Go ahead.From plasma cannons to heavy crossbows, from double miniguns to auto flame shotguns - this game has it all. Just saying the name of a weapon makes you imagine it and think how awesome it is. And when you finally get to find them in game, pick them up and use them, it's going to be just as awesome and just as chaotic as you imagined. As this game is in early access, new weapons are being added all the time, and when you read something like ""Added a Flame Cannon"" in the update notes, you can't help but smile and think to yourself - yes, that's exactly the amount of chaos I want to cause next time I open up this game.You WILL die. You will die a lot. You will die in the most fair and the most unfair ways possible. But one thing is for sure. Each death, no matter how infuriating, will always teach you something. And in the end, each death makes you a better player. In a matter of hours, you will be pulling off professional dodging maneuvers, carefully picking mutations to build your character for the strategy you envisioned and the weapons you have, and before you know it, it will be 3am and you will be saying ""just one more run"".As this game is in early access, it's bound to change and I hope that it proceeds in the direction it's heading. If you're in doubt whether you're going to get your money's worth - yes, you will. You will get much more than that. Once it's out of early access, I have no doubts that this game will be one of the best games released for that year. I honestly recommend you pick the game up and give it a shot.			"

												Nuclear Throne is an interesting game to tackle, basically if you want the most short and dumbed down version of the review: It's a top-down roguelike shooter you both love and hate.This game features 12 characters, each one with custom passives, actives, pros and cons, And the goal of the game is to reach the Nuclear Throne, On the way to sit thy throne you'll find many weapons, and you'll level up to select upgrades, The game feels wonderful to play with smooth controls, and nice music and crunchy sound effects, It does great at capturing that wonderful arcade feel.In this game however, don't expect to beat it in your first few attempts, It's hard, REALLY HARD,But it's so worth it.If online co-op is your thing there's a mod which adds that, which is also wonderful.This is probably like 90% biased so take this with a grain of salt but i love the game, and i can easily reccommend it.

												48 hours. That's how long it took me to finally sit on the 'Nuclear Throne'. However my winning run was only 14 minutes. Then I find out the game loops!? And has even MORE stuff after looping?! This game is truly the 'Tales of Maj'Eyal' for action rougelikes. Lot's of content, endless replayability, randomized levels, and some real difficulty to keep you busy for a long time.TL;DR+ Huge replayability+ Lot's of content+ Good Difficulty+ Easy to pickup or put down- Screen can get a little crazy- Exploding cars- Lil' Hunter (may he rot in Nuclear Hell!)GAMEPLAYThis game is a 2D rougelike. For those of you who don't know what rougelike means, it is a game genre that is characterized by you dying often... But you die often in plenty of other games too... So what's the difference? Well, a rougelike seems to intend that you die multiple times, and not just to learn from your mistakes (though you do), but to set points of progress that you must better yourself by. Each death you say to yourself, ""I can do better than that"" and you can... It just might take some practice. Even if you've only got 15 minutes to play you'll be getting better every time.Anyways, the game has multiple characters for you to play as through a randomly generated set of levels in 7 different areas. You collect 'rads' from fallen enemies that are used to upgrade your character with different abilities called 'mutations'. Each character fits different playstyles and strategies. For example: The 'Eyes' character has telekinetic abilities that can push away enemy projectiles while pulling in the enemies themselves. This suits them for melee oriented combat. The 'Fish' character can quickly roll in the direction of the mouse, allowing for easier dodging. Additionally the 'Fish' receives more ammo from pickups than the other characters. This suits them for running around the map dodging enemies while shooting like crazy.Not much in the game can truly be considered unfair when you think about it, aside from cars that explode and kill you right before you win the level... And a crazy flying blue-dude that can blow-up right on top of you immediately after he appears.The game encourages developing your skills on the different characters and mastering the many weapons to be found. If you're a good learner, it will quickly become a very enjoyable experience. If your a boulder-brained, doltish, stick-in-the-mud, you probably won't find much virtue in the learning process.STORYThe game itself doesn't really disclose any thing story-wise besides a wordless cutscene or two. However, the wiki for the game does have an interesting bit of lore to educate you on the world behind the bullets and explosions.GRAPHICSThe graphics are pixely and that fits the game just fine if you ask me. However, the crazy explosions, flames, smoke, and other eye candy can make it difficult to see the screen at times. Other than that, solid.CONCLUSIONI would definently recommend this game to anyone looking for some fun. It has been loaded with all sorts of interesting mechanics and unlockables that will keep you playing long after you thought you finally 'beat it'. Also, the price is pretty fair. Considering that I've spent alot more time playing this than I have other games that cost twice as much.			"

Early Access Review
 REVIEW	Nuclear Throne is a roguelike, bullet hell shooter, with some RPG elements, however one could probably deduce that from the description. Vlambeer’s previous efforts to deliver a high-score based shooter, have failed to deliver on genuine replay value, and one could be done with them mere hours after purchase. Nuclear Throne is NOT that. You will be occupied for a long time after the purchase of Nuclear Throne, and will have your knowledge of the game tested, due to ever changing subtleties in the gameplay, level design and even themes as you progress. Be expecting a captivating experience for hundreds of hours after purchase, I know I’m only getting started! The gameplay in Nuclear Throne is simple. Each character has a passive and active ability. These abilities keep one from sticking with a single character, and force one out of their comfort zone. This is helped by the fact that all the abilities are majorly balanced (except for the Chicken, which has recently been nerfed). I would call the gameplay a hybrid of Hotline Miami and The Binding of Isaac, however it is so much more. This is due to its immense gameplay depth. By this I mean, the game allows you to adapt the gameplay to your playstyle, and alter character’s unlockable abilities to synergies with one another, for example: A person could choose the “get more crates ability” along with the “Find more weapons ability” to have a greater likelihood of finding more guns, if that’s how he plays. Speaking of guns, the game has a wide selection of creative weaponry. These go from melee weapons, to hybrids of sniper rifles, shotguns and even fire. Even through the carnage of setting the whole screen ablaze with a flame shotgun, one can easily appreciate the game’s worthwhile arsenal. The difficulty pacing is very well handled, because at times I noticed the game was being as I wanted it to. If  The gameplay is made more enjoyable by the game’s extremely well designed aesthetics. The screen shakes like crazy, and enemies flash white and pause when hit, to give the game a punchier, more powerful feel. The pixel art style is good. Nothing of the art is so beautiful that it deserves commending, but it at least gets the job done well. Enemies all look good, and help make the “post fallout” theme really be in the core of the game at all times, always making you feel like the world around you is a desolated wasteland. My major complaint is that the size of the pixels, make it, sometimes, difficult to distinguish major pieces of information, like text, or even bullets. I still find it difficult to distinguish between a shotgun, and a pop gun. Musically the game is fantastic. All music has a theme that corresponds to the environment where it is found, and it sounds great! Psychedelic vocals play in the sewers, and rap plays in Y.V.s pimped-out mansion. The actual sound design for all the weapons is fine. It doesn’t strive to do anything special, and sticks to the similar sounds found in most retro-shooters.  FINAL THOUGHTS	 In the unlikely event that you have read this far (please let me know in the comments if you have ☺), I would like to talk about the amazing job that the developers are doing. The game is in the dreaded “early access” stage, however the game right now is basically complete. Developers are constantly adding new content to keep the game fresh, and its getting kind of ridiculous! I’ve never seen such a passion for expanding the community (which is terrific by the way), and for that I respect Vlambeer, despite their shortcomings in Luftrausers. I strongly recommend anybody interested in fun games purchases this game, because its well worth its price, even in early access, make no mistakes, this is one of the best retro shooters ever, and I definitely wont be refunding this *wink wink* SCORE	80/100A solid title, worthy of players with interests in any other genre, and content well worth the price. Just don't come in looking for a well developed multiplayer.			"

												I recently got this game (thanks to Star_ and his streamers) and I already have 25 hours on it. It's an amazing time killer, though the game isn't complete so you may want to wait it out. Plus, I suck at rogue-likes (though I enjoy them nonetheless) so it may not be for you, for it can be unforgiving in some places (which is only to be expected). If you like rouge-likes (something like Binding of Issac) then I'd say this may be for you.			"

												Now I hear a lot of people saying Enter the Gungeon is supposed to be better than this game and Isaac. Enter the gungeon is 60 fps while this game is 30 fps. However there are two main reasons why I prefer this game more to Gungeon. First is that the game feels a lot more skill based than gungeon. Whenever I play gungeon, it feels like how you do on the first boss widely depends on the items you get on the first floor. If you have not such a good loadout, the first boss feels like it takes forever to destroy. And most of the time, the loadout you get in the beginning isn't so great. In this game, that's not really the case. Usually by the time you reach the first boss, you have a lot likely adequately equipped, in which you can fight the boss without it overstaying its welcome. As for enemies in this game, it also feels like while you can kill enemies easily, they can kill you easily too, so how long you really last in this game depends on your skill. The other reason I prefer this game to Gungeon, and this is a big one, is because IT HAS ONLINE CO-OP. Well, unofficially. You have to download a mod to get it to work, called ""Nuclear throne together"". Believe it or not, this mod does have a fair share of users active. And after playing it for around an hour, I have to say that it is one of the best co-op games I've ever played. Enter the Gungeon could have also greatly benefitted from co-op but sadly it's not available in that game. Not to say that Gungeon isn't a bad game. What gungeon has in itself is solid. But this game feels like you win more with skill, not with the gun you're holding, and really, if you don't mind 30 FPS, you're going to have a hell of a time with this game.  Also you have many characters with different playstyles, craploads of guns, probably around the same amount as gungeon, and online play. Seriously, why are you still reading this? Go out and buy this game!My score of this game (with co-op) = 9.0/10			"

												Early in this game's development, it already was an extremely satisfying game to play. The impacts of your actions and the crunchy sound effects added together to make a wonderful top-down experience. It seemed like they already had the ""game feel"" nailed, and most of Early Access would be focusing on adding more content. And then each update came, week after week, and it continued to just feel better and better, and with more content to boot! Any aspiring game developer should spend a good amount of time studying how Vlambeer gets the feeling of their games just right. The gameplay is fine too. The weapon/character/enemy variety keeps the game interesting for potentially hundreds of hours. The Early Access period also led to some very well balanced generation as well. Each run through the game depends almost entirely on skill alone; it's not often that the game screws you or carries you like in The Binding of Isaac.Mind you, it's still a difficult game. One moment might be going pretty well until a momentary lapse in concentration puts you from full health to zero. Life is fragile in the wasteland and it takes a good amount of dedication to gain the experience to reliably make it through even the first few areas. But even once you get the hang of it, there's no real skill ceiling to the game. The difficulty past the throne will continuously ramp up to push you to your limit, and those late game situations mowing through massive waves of enemies really highlight the ""game feel"" that Vlambeer does so well. A high recommendation from me. Give it a shot if you're up to the challenge.			"

												The thing about rougelikes is that they make you feel like a complete moron. You find yourself tutting at yourself, ashamed of your own ineptitude. Nuclear Throne is no different. In fact it's probably harsher than average. And that's a very good thing.Maybe I'm just a noob. I think I am. I get massacred every time: on numerous ocassions an irradiated rat has knawed me to death. Cars have exploded from stray enemy rounds and sent me spiralling across the level. A crocodile with a shotgun once made me wish my father had never had that dirty glint in his eye looking at my mother. I mean, they're divorced now, and that whole experience was probably less rage inducing than Nuclear Throne.I may be a sadomasochist for this type of thing, but I keep going back. Each run, each easily avoided slaying, simply drives me on to discover more of the complex progression system. The depth of game's secrets, weapon management and characters are all of incredibly high standard. All lures in their own right.But I think the main reasons I love this game are its weird sense of humour and beautfiul graphics. Any game that has a mutated Fish rolling around fighting robot assassins, giant maggots and really angry turtles, all rendered in an eye-wateringly lovely arcade art style, has my support.Buy it. Die. Die again. Stop playing for two days. Be drawn back like a fly to a steaming turd. Die some more. Relish every second.'tis good.			"

								'Procedural Death Labyrinth' is absolutely the best way to describe this game. Hours of procedurally generated hard-as-nails top down shooter fun. You'll die over and over and over, but the game doesn't get any less fun. Great music to back up the unique visual style which fits perfectly with the gameplay. It's refreshing also to see an early access game which has so much support from the devs. They livestream development of the game every week which allows us to influence directly the balancing and features of the game. Vlambeer have outdone themselves with this title and I am sure I will continue to enjoy the game for many hours to come, even if I never do get good enough to reach the throne.Steam needs more top down shooters!

 You did not reach the Nuclear Throne Nuclear Throne has this  addictive feeling to it, that only a few games manage to create. Developer 'Vlambeer' did a great job again with this rougelilke-like game.It reminds oneself of games like 'The binding of Isaac'and 'Gun Godz' (also made by Vlambeer) and is much likethe latter one really based on skill rather than luck.Meaning that even if you get some nasty luck with yourupgrades on a run, you can still make it work.Added to that it is hard like crystallized carbonite.So i can only recommend this game to anyone who likes a good challange and wants to feel like a real Gun God.

												I suck hardcore at this game but I'm going to review it anyway (again). Basically it's a rouge-ish bullet hell game about a group of mutants who are on a journey to claim the nuclear throne, one of the most soul beating, ♥♥♥♥ kicking, rage inducing bosses ever (And it's not even really the final boss). You have a selection of 12 characters to play with, each with their strengths and weaknesses. It also includes a leveling up system with each level allowing you to choose from four powers, know as mutations. There are a multitude of stages with increasingly difficult enemies (But very few border the line of unfair). After a few levels a boss will spawn randomly from a wall or in the middle of the screen. These bosses range from: ""Pfft that was a boss?"" to ""Ah ♥♥♥♥ I'm screwed, oh ♥♥♥♥ here he comes."" I'd say it is very skill based and unforgiving, so if you are into that kind of thing in a game this will be right up your alley. I still have yet to master it but I still find the fun in it even if I suck. Also the devs seem interested in just making games and constantly updated the game till its full release, and there will most likely be content later. There are a couple of drawbacks however. Due to the games random nature, you can get a reaaaaaaally bad spawn where the boss spawns two feet from you or where you have minimum protection against a huge wave of fish (no joke). TL;DRPros: A good selection of charactersGood devsFun yet not boringly easyLots of secretsNice art and sound tracksA looping systemLOCAL Co-opCons: A couple of unfair bosses/enemiesRNG spawns can make you want to tear your arms off and slam your face on your keyboardLosing a great run can give you a heart attackUnsure post-EA future (Maybe)Flame TrapsRating: 9.5/10			"

												Update : Played 177 hours and finally I unlocked the B skin for my favorite character. Boy this game is hard.I played 43 hours of this, counting upwards day by day, and I am regretting every single second, I am playing this piece of garbage. But now to explain this, rather bad sounding beginning.This game, is great. Great at the gameplay, the roguelike, the weapons, not so much the enemies but still good enough. Another thing its good at is making me frustrated like hell. I have played so many times, so many hours AND I AM STILL NOT PAST THE SEVENTH GOD DAMN AREA! This game is good, its amazing! COULDNT LOVE OR HATE IT MORE!Seriously if you are a masochist, buy it. You are going to love it. You played Dark Souls and love it? Play this! You get about the same ""GIT GUD"" garbage.But now to the real thoughts:This game is good. It actually is amazing. I love it dearly and I couldnt hate it more either. It is like Binding of Isaac if you take all the fun parts out and replace it with a literal bullethell from Touhou. Remember the Mom fight or Hush? And how hard they were? Now think of that in every single level past the first 4. Actually even the first 3 level can contain that. And I am not talking about a tiny room with one boss doing this. No, the level is big and filled with enemies that shoot at you and attack you if you are too close to them as well. And if you manage not to get hit, you will be happy. This however will most likely not be the case with all types of enemies running around, hitting you as you touch them.All in all, I give this game a ""good"" on my scale. It only reaches good because its frustrating as hell. Even more than ""Binding of Isaac"". Like, I didnt think there would be a game out there like that...Now back into the hell of this game...Urgh...			"

								While still under development, Nuclear Throne is a sublime game which will burn your hours. As challenging as it is fun, it harkens to older games. The different characters offer a wide variety of playstyles add to that the randomness of the drops and mutations and you'll get a great replay value. The soundtrack by kozilek is a great addition to this game, creating the adequate atmosphere for a post apocalyptic wasteland shootout.TL;DR: Vlambeer delivers again			"

The game plays as a top-down rogue-like action game, and is basically what happens when you mix binding of isaac and borderlands together, slap on some retro-ish graphics, then cover it in bullet hell smegma. I thoroughly enjoy this game and hope you do too. ( hopefully featuring Dante from Devil May Cry & Knuckles).			"

												One of the best top-down shooters ever created, Nuclear Throne is a challenging, fast-paced ♥♥♥♥-'em-up that makes every run intense. With procedural generation and a wide variety of characters and weapons, and the goal of always getting further even once you've beaten the throne, it never gets boring. The post-apocalyptic style is awesome and everything is designed really well from both gameplay and design standpoints.My only gripe is that lategame (loop 2+) could have been balanced better, it usually becomes a massive bullet spam that forces you to either always have a melee weapon to clear projectiles or hug corners and slowly get rid of enemies, which kinda whithers down the shoot em up aspect for me. Regardless it's still incredibly fun at this point and pushes you to keep trying to get further (which is still very hard).I highly recommend trying this game at some point, it's definitely worth it's full price.

It seems rouge like games are a dime a dozen lately, but this game stands out among all the others.  I havent had this much fun with a rogue like since Binding of Issac.

												Nuclear Throne is a procedurally generated twin stick shooter, set in a zany post-apocalyptic world, Unlike most games of its kind, the right stick is used for aiming but you have to press your controller's trigger to actually shoot bullets/shells/grenades...The game does many things very well. The shooting feels as good as it gets short of holding an actual weapon in your hand (at least I think so, I never held one). Enemy AI is well balanced for this kind of arcade game. They hide around corners but not so well as to make the game tedious.Nuclear Throne scatches an itch similar to that of the Binding of Isaac, but with shorter sessions. Both games are arcade shooters, procedurally generated, and unbalanced by design (Nuclear Throne is much harder though). I still prefer Isaac, because it has much more content and variety. After nearly 20 hours, I begin to grow tired of Nuclear Throne already, but those 20 hours have been very fun. "

												Ultimately it just wasn't for me and I think it's fair to say it may not be for others too.Nuclear Throne gets a lot right. A lot! Visuals are off the charts, sound is fun, and the gameplay is as smooth as silk and satisfying to wield (I went with keyboard and mouse, but controller didn't feel half bad for a few rounds either). Now I hate comparing apples and oranges but you immediately get this sense of it being some sort of glorious love child of two fan favorites; Binding of Isaac and Risk of Rain. I was downright giddy after my first few runs. Unfortunately it lacks something vitally important that make both of those mainstays; There's just no sense of progression here. I may be getting worse at gaming but I just didn't feel like I accomplished anything after my first run. A first run that throws all sorts of character unlocks in your face and gives you a false sense of how the game will progress. It just really doesn't after that. Well, not for a long time anyway. The only thing that kept me going besides self loathing was that I received an ""achievement"" for killing a boss that I had not. So I felt obligated to end him at least once. And this alone gave me the bulk of my 15hrs of playtime. Because well, the game is a punishing hectic mess and that's how long it took to off the dude! Which I will say is not a bad thing on it's own but as I said, there is just no rewards or progression for your truly futile efforts.You unlock a character now and then when you notice a funky secret, but they rarely bring anything to the table that gets you over the next hump or obstacle in your way. For me, they never did. Its just you versus the cruel world of the game. 15hrs of playing and I have the same equipment at my disposal as I started with. You just get better on your own. Or in my case, you don't. And the biggest problem is that the brunt of this equipment comes in the form of random number generation. Your level upgrades are a roll of the dice and chances are, much more often than not, you won't get a chance to pick the upgrades you'd prefer. This makes the bulk of your runs a large step in quality below the runs featuring a perfect dice roll. And you better believe you'll make a stupid mistake and ruin your good setup should you get it! Pure punishment. I dunno, I guess I'm a wimp, but I'm tapping out. There was just something lacking for me. Much like the developers other title LUFTRAUSERS it gives you instant satisfaction but if you're in it for the long haul you better have some serious dedication and be an absolute glutton for punishment. I love the idea of what Vlambeer can accomplish with a program like Game Maker: Studio and it should be taken as inspiration to those aspiring. It is well worth a purchase in that regard. But no matter how smooth and pretty they keep making these titles I'm left with feelings of unbalance and lacking of progression. I wish I could ""git gud"" at this and see some of the later level stuff, but there's just no motivation to do so. Every one of my steps forward has 150 steps backwards in between with no new lessons learned. Beyond being a bundle game I can't recommend it. The fun just ends after 30mins and the punishment and praying to the ""RNG Gods"" begins. Proceed with caution.			"

												In short, Nuclear Throne is a roguelite 2D top-down bullet hell dungeon crawler shooter.It takes many elements from the great pioneers of all of these (sub)genres, violently mashes them together and adds some more difficulty to the surprisingly well-smelling mess.You start off in the wasteland with... well, nothing but a bad gun with a bit of ammo really.As you kill all enemies to progress to the next randomly generated stage, you'll try to loot dead enemies and chests for better guns (that all play differently and are all better in certain situations), more ammo for those guns and rads (which give you the ability to mutate between stages) in a desperate attempt to not die horribly. (which WILL happen eventually)As you git gud, you will also unlock: new characters which encourage different playstyles, a  variety of improved golden weapons to start with in future runs to make delving down to the throne less hard, skins that don't do sh♥t, and challenging crowns to add even more spice to the pili-pili.Once you reach and kill the throne, the game will 'loop', throwing you back in the first stage with a lot more and harder enemies to kill (you). This process will repeat itself. UNTIL YOU DIEI have not played a whole lot of this game, but i'll be adding more to this review as i play and discover more.			"

												Another Vlambeer work of art. Fast-paced top-down roguelike mouse+keyboard (highly recommended) or dual stick shooter. I've happily poured hours into this game and will continue to do so without regret. Several characters to choose from, each with unique abilites and tradeoffs that are well designed to offer a challenging experience. Enemies are numerous and if you're like me, will kill you dead again and again, making it that much more gratifying to knock their block off with a shotgun blast. Or stick 'em between the eyes with a crossbow bolt. Or blow them to kingdom come with a cluster grenade. Or laser their face with lasery lasers. Etc., etc., etc.Music and sound design are on point, to be expected from this developer but worth a mention just the same.Very few gripes, none worth listing here.

								A crazy, hectic, and fun-as-hell top-down shooter! This game doesn't mess around. It throws you right into the action, and you must learn and adapt if you wish to survive.Despite this game's difficulty level, it is not unfair. With practice, you can learn how to efficiently deal with specific enemies and scenarios that you once thought you would never overcome. Dodging, positioning, and timing are all important skills to develop.The upgrades system is very simple, but helpful enough to keep things interesting. You can mix and match upgrades to find builds that suit your playstyle. Not to mention all of the unique weapons you can find hidden in the wastelands.I can be a hothead when it comes to games, but this game does not particularly upset me when I lose. I just try again, and I don't mind trying again because of how enjoyable the game is to play! If the genre interests you, it is definitely worth a try.

												Fast paced action and rogue-like elements, for me that's an ideal combination.The game is hard, but it' still fun since it's not unfair. It's just me that sucks :) Even after playing for 16h I've not even seen the Nuclear Throne. But I still had fun dying all the time.Since it is now officially released, I have to say that the game was kind of buggy throughout the Early-Access process. They fixed stuff and the broke stuff - which is fine, since they were at least working regularly on it and they were listening to the community, the developers have to be applauded for that.The current state? It works, it's fun: definitive recommendation.			"

								Nuclear Throne is a phenomenal game that doesnt cease to please. No matter your skill level, the game constantly brings new things into the mix to help you or to harm you ( every single week). Also regardless of skill, this game bring endless hours of fun. Unlike other Rouge-Lite games, as of now, this game provdies 12 unique characters all with their own play-styles. Want to be a tank, Crystal is for you. Enjoy high-risk playing, Melting will suit you nicely. Nuclear Throne does an excellent job of incorporating a character to suit practically anyone. Nuclear Throne also adds a feature that is different than most other games of it's type; ammo management.  Just when you think you are about to beat Lil' Hunter and make it to the throne room, you can run out of ammo and it can mean almost certain death. This can influence your gun choices drastically, is it really worth taking the triple machine gun? Or the Hyper Rifle? As opposed to a Heavy Crossbow? On the subject of guns, every gun feels relatively different, not like the developers were lazy and reskinned a gun and called it new. Overall, Nuclear Throne does a great job of challenging anyone while still making sure that it is beatable. I would personally reccommend it to anyone i know, as Nuclear Throne provides something for all types of Gamers.			"

												I mean this out of the bottom of my heart when I say this game is amazing. It is a phenominally good game to play with HOURS of play value! To simply put it, the game is like if Binding of Isaac and Fallout had a baby. The game has ton of unlockables and achievements that really test how good you are at the game and it can be a real challenge to get some of them. If I had to say so, this game is definetly not for a casual gamer looking for a laid-back play-style, if you play this prepare for intense shaking, heavy breathing, and sweaty hands. Also alot of depression and potential crying from dying from rediculos ways (DEM CAR EXPLOSIONS). Anyway, if I had to rate this game on a scale from 1 to 10, I am going for a 9.5 out of 10. .5 being excluded because there are some bugs that can ruin an entire run. Examples include: 1: Sometimes entering an area called the Crown Vault after doing something specific will cause a rare bug in which tiles and enemies that don't appear in the area spawn. 2: Sometimes the game crashes randomly at the start of some boss fights. For me this is COMPLETELY random. And finally 3: Sometimes when walls are exploded the top of the wall still coveres the floor so you can't see ANYTHING! This has ended so many runs for me because of enemies running after me under the wall so I didn't have time to aim or run. Anyway these bugs are rare so I still say this game is a definet must-get if your a thrill-seeker who loves to have adrenline rushes when you play games. :3			"

Nuclear Throne is a very well made roguelite twin-stick shooter that incredibly fun and satisfying to play that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys roguelikes. There are six different categories of guns; Bullet, Shell, Arrow, Laser, Explosive and Melee. Each one of them feels different and unique so there will be a preferred weapon type for everyone. The gunplay in the game is very well done, all the weapons feel like they have a weight to them and it is fun to mix different weapons to find the perfect combination. The randomized nature of the game means that players will get to experiment and experience all the weapons. Furthermore, it’s very satisfying to learn the how the weapons work and master the controls of the variety weapons.There are a variety of character which have unique abilities such as rolling and shields and player also levels up their character through the run which will unlock new attributes, leading to some unique builds that will adjust how the player will play the game, meaning every run is unique. There is also daily challenges which will spawn a new run every day and you can replay the same map for a day and try to place on the leaderboard, rather than a randomized level each time, creating a variety of game modes.Every stage in the game feels unique with new enemies introduced that you learn the patterns. The game has elements of Shmup games with a large amount of bullets flying towards you and can get overwhelming but it’s very satisfying find a path through the enemies and beat the level.Even though the game can be very challenging, the difficulty curve is not too steep so that it doesn't become too hard for players too quickly, the player is always in a space where it is possible to fight out of any challenge.The sound design and graphics both build a very unique atmosphere, the music often matches the settings perfectly and is very invigorating when fighting the enemies. The pixel graphics are very detailed and unique that gives the game great charm and character that is wonderful to look at, all the enemies are instantly recognizable and interesting to fight.This is also a paragon of early access games. The devs have made over 90 weekly updates to the game that add new features such as weapons, characters, as well as adjust and rebalance gameplay. They listen to the community; they deserve some respect for their commitment to the game in a landscape of exploitive developers who want to release buggy, broken games to get a quick buck, such as DayZ and countless other scams. Nuclear Throne started out a great game and has only gotten better over time as more things get added to the game, as it soon approaches its full release, it sets a standard for early access games on Steam and it is a shame that this level of dedication to a game isn’t seen very often. Overall, definitely worth picking up to support good developers and a great game, looking forward to the final release coming up soon!			"

												I have this game on my PS4, so don't let my playtime fool you.Where do I begin? This is why we love indie devs! For every Jumpix Jump, there are absulote gems of games like this. I bought it on my PS4 as an impulse buy because I liked the pixel characters. I had no idea what I was in for. I bought it again through Humble Bundle just because I loved it so much. (I know Sony doesn't give indie devs that much revenue.)  I never done that before. I could have given that money to charity. What am I doing with my life? (I don't regret it. I support indie devs!)This game is the hardest game I have ever played. It's harder then Shovel Knight, Dark Souls and Bloodborne. However, it's not cheap or unplayable like a lot of old NES games. Every mistake is your own fault. Only a few bad spawns made the game feel unfair. Otherwise, this game is based purely on your skill as a player and willingness to learn it's rules. This is great game for speedrunners and competetive players. It takes skill to play this game good. And once you finally master it, it throws a new trick at you.I am what you would call a casual gamer. I'm not a big fan of difficult games, let alone bullet heaven type games. However, I was immediatly pulled in by this game. I'm addicted. You die and die again, and yet I can't stop hitting the retry button. That is amazing that a game this hardcore could pull in a casual player like me.I grew up on the NES and the SNES. (I'm young, btw. Second hand gaming rules.) Those are my two favorite systems, and this game feels like it would belong among the most legendary and classic games on those systems. I love the graphics. The pixel art is beautiful. Every character, enemy and stage has their own personality. Obviously a lot of love went into this game. This just goes to show what can be done with Gamemaker studio. I actually really love Gamermaker games when they're done well. I think there's a charm to them.When it comes to the gameplay, there a million ways to play. Every character has their strengths and weaknesses, and along with various randomized mutations and a HUGE arsnel of weapons - there is a lot you can do! Which really adds to replayability. You can easily get 500+ hours from this little game. It's full to the brim with secrets, character and charm that will keep you coming back for more. As a NES/SNES fanboy, I think this game just trumped a lot my classic favorites. This is my favorite game by far and goes to show why we need indie games. I have plenty of mainstream AAA games with top notch graphics, but I come back to little games like these more often than not.I can not praise this game enough. It's a little masterpiece of an indie game. What are you waiting for? Get it. Through Humble Bundle if you can, if you want to support this dev more. (Go to the game's website. The link is there.)I have a few tips for you:- You will die. A lot. You will get frustrated and grit your teeth and curse this game. Take a break. Play another easier game (preferably Stardew Valley) or put the controller down, and then come back. You'll realize that when you're calm, you're doing better then when you were stressed.- There is no pointless character. Even if a character seems useless to you, every one is cleverly planned out to have strengths. It's up to you to figure out what those are. (Or you could just look it up, like a cheater.)- Crystal is BY FAR the easiest character to play as, but I would only play as him if you're just starting and getting used to the game's difficulty. Because of his special ability, learning how to play the game with this character can be counter-productive. You need to learn how to dodge.- There are plenty of secrets, but most are obvious once you realize how to find them. Keep your eyes open.EDIT: - Also, there's one more thing I'd like to mention. The screen shakes a bit in partcularly chaotic fights. If this bothers you, there is a setting in the options to turn screen shaking off. I did this and prefer the game with it off.I bought this game for co-op. It's awesome. In an age when were seeing less and less couch co-op games, this is really appreciated. Thank you devs for giving me such an amazing experince.NOTE: (13/03/2016) As of the time of writing this, the PS4 version of this game, however, is unfortunetly broken. Once you get past the beginning stages, it could crash at any time for no reason. It doesn't happen often, but it's annoying as heck. I have yet to hear any word on this being fixed. Darn it. Also, the game seems like it doesn't fit on the screen. I tested the PC version and it doesn't have this problem. It's especially noticeable on the tutorial level. The text is almost totally blocked because it goes off the screen. No word on this being fixed. I would recommend the PC version. I love this game to death, BUT it's unbelievable that ANYONE could release a game on the Playstation store in this state! This problem probably hurt the game more than we know.I would still prefer playing on my PS4 though, as the crashes aren't often enough to render the game unplayable.			"

								Nuclear Throne is one of my all time favourite games on steam. It is definitely one of my significant and satisfying games in my steam library. Extremely addictive, but fun to play. Nuclear Throne is packed with 7 different kind of worlds, over 100 guns, 4 bosses (Including the Throne), Different kinds of mutations, updates every week and a lot more! There are also 12 different characters with unique abilities that will help you survive in the apocalyptic world. Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah.(38 hours of playing Nuclear Throne, and I finally looped. It took me a while as I had to face the Throne 3 times and Throne II 2 times to loop once. I had a Heavy Assault Rifle and Heavy Auto Crossbow which are really OP weapons).			"

Not only does its playstyle allow newer players to learn the game, but it also lets advanced or more experienced players still have fun. The game is fun, and since you restart from the beginning at every death, makes you cautious around certain enemies and allows you to learn from your previous mistakes. Additionally, I love the mutations, and like how you can choose certain mutations to fit your own playstyle and make the game more fun. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone, and promise that it will provide hours of enjoyable play-time.			"

												Nuclear Throne is an amazing arcade-style top-down shooter with startling amounts of replayability. It's fast-paced and not once have I been bored in all of my playtime.The characters are the most colorful and creative I have ever witnessed, which is extremely surprising, considering most of them are simple one-word concepts drawn up as people. Or gods. Or even fish. I don't know how it works, but it does.The gameplay is perfectly designed; the mutations are really satisfying to pick, and get even more satisying as you get better at the game and actually know which mutations do what.For those that are iffy on the difficulty of the game, I can say the difficulty is definitely high, but I consider it a large feature of the game. The goal is to reach the Nuclear Throne, and it's not expected of you to do it on your first try, but when you do, (took me 50-60 hours) you will feel so accomplished. Everything in your entire life will light up in stunning clarity, and just as you commence the final fight, ready to take your Nuclear Throne...you die because you didn't know there was a sudden-death beam at the beginning. you're welcomeBut it was worth it, because then you knew it was possible, and you could do it again with an entirely different character, different levels, different guns, and all the same glorious feeling of killing everything in your sight.It's fun. I promise.			"

												Its out. Its finally out. Finally out in a good way, not in the ""Ugh, this is taking so long..."". To be honest, I had no idea what I was doing when I first played this game, and I wasn't really that interested in it. I watched Northernlion play his daily runs and whatnot, and with every episode I watched I wanted to play the game more. So I finally actually gave the game a proper go. It was fun but I still didn't know what was going on. I continued to play Nuclear Throne more and more and with every playthrough I was learning and I was getting better. [I've only looped once]. This game is now AMAZING. Vlambeer could've released it a long time ago but they decided to keep it in Early Access. With every update I wanted to play more! Vlambeer have done MASSIVE updates for this game week after week and its made the game so GOOD. It feels so satifying to see a game grow into something this... this phenomenal! It was a bumpy ride at the begginning, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was it worth it for me to stick around with this game. When it was in Early Access it was awesome, and now its even more awesome now that its released. And even better, Vlambeer are going to continue to update Nuclear Throne, and expanding its story and the game. This game is amazing. I love, and I'm glad I gave it another chance when I first bought it. Thank you Northernlion and thank you Vlambeer for making one of the best indie games on Steam. Its been a pleasure to see it grow and develop into something great.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. It was honestly a tribute to Vlambeer in all honesty. I love Nuclear Throne and I hope everyone else does too!			"

								Choose your music of choice, turn it up to 11, choose your character and enter one of the most gratifying games I've ever played. Nuclear Throne is a game of weapons, mutations and dying. So much dying. While there is a way to end the game without dying you can if you choose to; play the game until you die long past any point of reason. With colourful characters like Fish, Plant and Rebel, fantastical guns such as Grenade Shotgun, Super Crossbow and Laser Minigun not to forget our adverseries, Necromancers, Salamanders and... Lil' Hunter; Nuclear Throne is a game of immense replayability and wonderful fun. Honestly I think if you enjoying shooting things and enjoy a challenge Nuclear Throne is the game for you, it's as simple as that.  I guess I should put down some kind of benchmark for the difficulty. If you found the original Binding of Isaac was a mountain to climb, Nuclear Throne is colonising Mars with a tuna sandwich and some cardboard boxes. "

												I got this game on sale, and it's worth full price. This game is a pixel top down shooter, and one of the best games I've played in a long time.10/10Pros: 1. Replayability 2. So many weapons to fit your playstyle, from melee weapons, shotguns, pistols, machine guns, to bolt weapons. Rocket launchers and even poison weapons!3. Fun characters that fit your playstyle (tanky character, fast movement character, ect). You even unlock more later in the game. Including a chicken o.o 4. The levels are amazing, and beating each one is and feels rewarding. 5. Fast-paced (Unless you are like me, hiding behind walls trying to hit enemies over the walls with the shovel)6. Hidden secrets that will surprise you when you find them. 7. Game doesn't hold your hand. 8. The pixel art is great, and I love love the music.Cons: I've died a lot. I suck. :( "

Early Access Review
								I'm only about 2 hours in at the time of this review, and this is probably the hardest I've ever raged at a video game.Nuclear Throne is incredibly fast-paced and frantic. It takes time getting used to the sheer amount of chaos happening at once. The game throws you right into the action with no tutorial or simplistic stages. When it comes to figuring out the game, you are pretty much left to your own devices.This game is also INCREDIBLY HARD. Some enemies shoot out a ruthless spray of bullets, and it only takes a couple of them to kill you. With no recovery time, your character can die within seconds. Fortunately, each stage has a plethora of different weapons lying around, and each one of them has various pros and cons. Each character has a special move specific to them, from deflecting bullets, to slow motion, to summoning allies for help and so on. This makes each character play very differently, adding to the replayability. Your character also levels up, and can pick from random mutations in order to receive various perks.With randomly generated levels and level up bonuses the game is endlessly replayable. Which is a good thing, because you will die A LOT. And every death sends you back to the start of the game. And there's no bonuses to make the game any easier when you restart. Nuclear Throne expects you to beat the game all at once, by only using your skills. The game is still a little rough around the edges, but it has a lot more polish than most other early access games. And it looks like Vlambeer is doing a great job at constantly working on the game. If you have the money, get this game. It's one of the best (if not the best) twin-stick shooters that I've ever played, even at this stage. Just keep in mind that getting to the Nuclear Throne is far from easy. "

								Hands down the best early access/ indie game I've ever played. As my first experience with a rogue-like, it's done more than live up to my expectations of the genre, but put hope into my heart for oustanding developers such as Vlambeer. I've had hours of fun with this game consistantly and I've never been disapointed since every time I play it's a new experience, while still containing keeping key elements that made me fall in love with this game from the start.

Product received for free
												Nuclear Throne is a top-down roguelike shooter, and a relatively good one at that; you can drag the window size to fit any resolution you so desire. In terms of gameplay, you select a character, run around, shoot enemies, dodge bullets, pick up better guns, repeat. A tried and true formula that works very well with games of its genre.I'm on the fence about this game, and if I could give it a ""neutral"" review, I would; since Steam only has ""Recommended"" vs ""Not Recommended"", I decided to lean towards the latter (therefore allowing all the rabid fanboys to downvote this without a second thought to help combat their own insecurities). Whatever helps you sleep at night, it doesn't change my review and what I have to say about the game.The gameplay is all fine and good, but this game honestly feels more luck-based than skill-based. That's not to say this game is not skill-based; utilizing cover to avoid bullets, then shooting them at opportune moments is a key element of this game. I say the game is luck based because of primarily two things; the levelling system, and the procedural generation of each stage.The levelling system is very straightforward; kill enemies, collect their exp drops, level up, select one of four randomly provided power ups at the end of the stage, continue. This is all fine and good, except for how (obviously) some power-ups are much better than others. Several times have I been starved for an ability that would prove most useful because the RNG failed to provide. As for the procedural generated levels, several times have I had a somewhat decent run instantly taken away from me by spawning in the next level surrounded by enemies with absolutely no cover, obliterating me within seconds. Regardless of who you are and how long you've played these kinds of games, no amount of 'skill' can allow someone to pop into a brand new level and instantly avoid a slew of bullets coming from literally every direction while effectively fighting back. Sometimes the level spawns many enemies into a tight room with a 1-block entryway, making it almost impossible to clear it out without taking some form of damage. To add insult to injury in such scenarios, many enemies move very quickly and do collision damage. My use of the term 'procedural generation' is stretching it for this game; the only thing inherently procedural about it is the fact that there's never a part of the map that's inaccessible in some form.Comparing other 'difficult' games (such as Spelunky, Hotline Miami, and Super Meat Boy), you die a lot, but each death in those games feels like it was your fault that you died, and you learn something from it that can be used to improve your next attempt. Nuclear Throne does not provide that. Each death feels cheap and the only thing you can really tell yourself in terms of improvement if you decide to try again is ""get better"". Have you ever asked a teacher for help, and they simply told you to ""do better""? I have. He was subsequently fired. I've seen and played games that are hard for the right reasons; Nuclear Throne is hard for the wrong reasons.Of course, all of what I said can be ""expected of roguelikes"", and ""if you don't like that kind of game, don't play it"". Roguelike fans call it art, I call it poor game design.In conclusion, Nuclear Throne isn't a bad game by any means; it just has some glaring flaws that really take away from its long-term enjoyability. After all, only a masochist would enjoy repeatedly attempting something, only to result in failure with little to no sense of progress.			"

												Oh boy, where do I start with this one;Nuclear Throne is a top-down roguelike shooter which features twelve unlockable characters (currently) and a wide array of weapons and enemies.The game also features many unlockables, such as golden weapons, different crowns and even different skins for characters.Onto the actual review; this game is a great one, a game in which you will love whole-heartedly but also have a deep hatred for simultaneously. Sometimes games can't land this right in the middle; leading to a rage-inducing game which isn't fun to play; but Nuclear Throne does it well. The somewhat difficult levels and multiple areas keep you coming back to complete more and more runs, not to mention the achievements too..Most of the characters have different abilites, such as Fish's rolling ability or Crystal's shielding; all character abilities are, by default, activated with the RMB. These become crucial in a run, some character's have pros and cons, some substitute ammo/HP for other buffs used during the game.The upgrades during this game impact the style, success and the difficulty of your run, with the upgrades coming everytime you ""level up"" in-game. This is achieved by finding and consuming ""rads"", obtained by killing enemies and/or finding rad capsules (little green bottles) throughout the level.The Daily and Weekly runs are also good for players who have completed the game fully (although this is very hard and is only achieved by a small percentage of players). The Daily is just a normal run, but you only get a single try, compete against others to get as many kills as possible (keep this is mind, the leaderboard is organised in kills, NOT distance of run). However the Weekly run is more specific, you get unlimited lives with the same leaderboard system (and a week to complete it, obviously) but only one character is playable and you sometimes even have weapon restrictions.Saying anymore would ruin the random surprises this game has to offer, so I'll leave it up to you, the reader, to discover these for yourself.Overall this game is very well made, a nice balance of rage-inducing gameplay and satisfaction all put into one. I would easily recommend this game to anyone who is interested.			"

								The year is 21XX. The United States of America is a shadow of its former self, ravaged by nuclear war and Al Gore's climate change. Amongst the city ruins of Los Angeles, a group of mutants set out on an adventure to discover the fate of one of their friends who claimed to have discovered the location of the mythical 'Nuclear Throne'. Along the way, their friendship will be put to the test as they fight off tribes of hostile mutants and the I.D.P.D., human survivors of the first great patriotic Nuclear war who fled to underground bunkers and escaped the ravages of radiation.Featuring voice acting from an ensemble cast starring Corey Feldman, Karl Urban, John Cena, Keanu Reeves, Sharlto Copley, James Franco, Mila Kunis and Michael Pena as Fish.Vlambeer delivers a gripping tale of self-discovery, love, and acceptance of the other, all underpinned by a prophetic warning of the dangers of the nuclear, climate change, and unregulated fracking. A must play.			"

								More than 350 hours in-game and this game still kicks my ♥♥♥ on a regular basis, so i decided it's time to write a review for this wonderful game.Despite being one of the hardest games I probably ever played (and maybe will play) i never was that addicted to a game. No matter how far you go and how good you get, there's always new fun and dangerous stuff in your way, more weapon/mutation combos to test out, a character strategy to explore, a new challenge to try and lots more.You always make new stupid mistakes that didn't happen before, try again, get further, die horribly, try again......and again......and again...With weekly updates, two devs streams a week and awesome community forums, this is probably the best game experience I ever had, I have never seen developers with that much dedication towards their project.This game has still a long way to go (it's Early Access, duh), but even now it is already my favorite top-down shooter of all time.The sound and the feel of things, the growing hordes of mutant enemies and the crazy, ever-expanding weaponry make this game just... so good.I don't even know what i like most about this game, the weapons, the enemies, the great community and developers... theres just so much that makes this game perfect.(also props to you if you read all of this.)

								WARNING!!!         IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO BUY THIS GAME READ CAREFULLY THIS REVIEW!!! Introduction This game is made to apeal to really small audience.Its very hard and it will probably destroy your sanity if you dont have experience with top-down shooters.(even if you played anyone of the hotline miami games,it will be very challenging).Even as an eperienced gamer in this type of games the SMALLEST MISTAKE can end a very powerful run.You can be at full HP but still die in seconds to explosions or by touching sth with a lot of contat dmg,This game also doesnt have invinsibility frames meaning that you can get hit by 10 proectiles in 0,01sec.You will probably die by every enemy 5 times until you learn their paterns.If you have weak psychology dont try this game!!!GameplayThe games is very fair when it comes to ammo and health drops.It may sometimes spawn you in a difficult position surounded by enemies but with enought practice you will be able to survive them even with the starting weapon and no Mutations.The main objective of the game is to beat th NUCLEAR THRONE and survive as long as you can after that.Its a bullethell game so remember that u need to be focused on shooting as much as on doging the projectiles,which is hard after all.After you beat the throne u will have to repeat the game from the start with MORE enemies and Secret Bosses for each area.After killing an enemy he will drop RADS with are used to level up.Leveling up lets you chose a Mutation which will help you in the game like more more HP morebigger ammo capasity etc.You can chose one of 4 randomly given to you mutations after finishing the aeria (if you leveled up)Pros and ConsPros-Great Retro graphics-Nice music and weapon sounds-Challenging and adictive (countless hours of playing)-Tons of Playable characters wth unique abilities and passives-Fair but difficult health system -Balanced weapons -A lot of improvements and updates-Requires a lot of skill (luck matters only in 5% of the games sytuation)-Lots of weapons (more than 100 for sure)-A good amount of mutations to pick from (about 20)Cons-Small audience-Still has bugs since its in eary accessOverall ReviewIts a 10/10 game for the small audience that it targets.You will not find it fun if you rage easilybecause the smallest mistake can end your run.I have 300hrs in this game in total on multiple acc andits my Favourite game.As to the ''would you reccomend it thing'' i have mixed feelings just because of the difficulity of the game,but if you really love challenging games then this one should apeal to you.Have fun!!!

												Original review posted on October 26, 2015:This game is amazing. It is fun and simple, but it is ungodly difficult at the same time. The premise behind the game is simple. You start the game with two characters, these being Crystal and Fish. All characters have two uniquie things. Their passive and their active. Their passive is just that; an ability that will run in the background, influencing your attack patterns and the drops for players. Their active is also known as their right-click ability. Left-click is the basic attack and the default movement is WASD. Just using the two starting characters as an example, I will show how different playstyles can be from character to character.Crystal-Passive: More base health than any other character.-Active: A temporary shield that will reflect multiple bullets and protect you from others.Fish-Passive: Extra ammo recieved-Active: A dodge rollNew review after multiple updates and a very particular mod release:Ah, it's nice to be back to playing this game regularly, but now, there is an extremely different experience of which I must say I enjoy partaking in.Now, if you have looked at the tags, it likely mentioned ""Local Multiplayer"" or ""Local Co-Op,"" but that no longer matters(provided your computer isn't a toaster and your internet isn't an Explorer). There is now a mod(which has been mentioned in the latest news by Vlambeer, so you know it's good) called Nuclear Throne Together, and it does exactly what you think it does; it allows you to play online co-op(or even Vs. with some creative/idiotic friends), albeit at a few costs to the core game.If there was one thing I absolutely loved, it was unlocking all of the characters(and what few B-skins I unlocked before save-editing them in, but that's a different story). The journey felt important, but sadly NTT takes that away by automatically unlocking all characters and B-skins(I know that it does as my idiotic friend hadn't even unlocked Steroids and yet, he was able to play Rouge with her B-skin using the mod).While this certainly does detract from the appeal of the journey, the game is still far from kind and is honestly just downright vicious.Now, since I have basically informed you to get NTT as soon as you start playing the game, I should probably give you some information regarding the rest of the other characters.The first two characters unlocked, Fish and Crystal, I explained in the previous version of this review.The next character, Melting, is unlocked by dying for the first time. He literally looks like a skeleton with melting flesh.Passive-2 health, but recieves an extra Rad(NT's version of Experience) from every enemy(including enemies that don't drop Rads)Active-Explodes all corpses on screen.Next is Eyes, and he's a bit of an interesting character. Firstly, his passive only works on three levels(four, including 4-?), these three(four) being known as the Transition Levels. He's unlocked by reaching the first Transition Level, the Sewers(2-1).Passive-See in the dark(allows him to see the outside boundaries of your FoV in the transition levels)Active-Telekinesis(push bullets away, but pulls enemies and items towards you)Next up is Plant, and boy-oh-boy, do I hate Plant. Plant is unlocked by reaching 3-1(I think), and I only ever unlocked him out of neccessity.Passive-More speed(GOTTSA GO FEST!)Active-Shoot a snare(traps enemies inside of it and acts as a source of light on the Transition Levels).Ah, back to the characters I like, and next up is Yung Venuz(more commonly referred to in game as Y.V.). To unlock Y.V., try to pick up a screwdriver in the desert(1-1 to 1-3) and take it to 3-1(screwdrivers can be found almost anywhere, but it's easiest for them to drop in chests at the very beginning). At 3-1, there will be cars that will explode from too much damage, but there is one car in particular that stands out. Attack that car once with the screwdriver and press your activate button(for me, a mere keyboard user, it is E). You can thank me later.Passive-Higher fire rateActive-Pop Pop(shoot two rounds of ammo for the currently equipped weapon at the cost of a slightly delayed rate of fire)Now, reaching 5-1, we unlock Robot, an interesting(but in my opinion, kind of boring) character to play.Passive-Finds better tech(finds weapons of higher levels than what would drop on any other character)Active-Eat your weapon(consumes the weapon currently equipped as the primary to give ammo for the other weapon).Now, we arrive at 6-1, and here's where things get interesting. Steroids is up next, and he brings a whole slew of power to your arsenal.Passive-Inaccurate(this is okay) and fully automatic fire(no matter what the weapon is)Active-Attacks with the weapon equipped in the off-handYes, that's right. As the load screen will tell you time-and-time again, ""Steroids can duel-weild.""Okay, now we're getting into the spoiler zone, so read at your own risk.Next up is Rebel, a character that can only be unlocked by defeating the Nuclear Throne and ending your run by sitting on it.Passive-Restores half of damage taken when completing level(If she has 2/12(let's say remaining health is X and max health is Y) remaining health when you complete the level, you'll enter the next level with 7, as (Y-X)/2 rounded down in this case would be 5, so (Y-X)/2+X would be the overall equation for her passive.Active-Okay, this one's a bit complex, so bear with me. On her first right click when entering a level, she will lose one HP and a minion will spawn. The minion will last 20 seconds before exploding, but there is a way to extend its lifespan. By right-clicking again, another minion will spawn, and this resets the timer for the first ones life(presumably, it heals them). However, every minion spawned after the first on a single level takes up two HP rather than one(you cannot kill yourself with this ability).Okay, this next character is kind of strange. Horror is unlocked by defeating Horror, who will only spawn when you skip the Rad Canisters on two levels in a row(as such, it is easiest to unlock him on 1-3, but I have accidentally had him spawn in on 4-1 and proceed to end my run).Passive-When choosing a mutation by leveling up, he will have 5 choices(as compared to the usual 4)Active-Ability to shoot accumulated Rads in a concentrated beam as a tertiary weapon(all Rads used in this way will only be regained if they actually hit their target). Also, Rad absorption will be paused when this ability is being used, so keep that in mind).Next is Rogue, and she is definitely the hardest to unlock. First off, when fighting the Nuclear Throne, destroy all of the generators(activated with the Throne's giant laser beam) and then kill the Throne. A portal will open up which leads to the Throne II fight. Beating the Throne II will let you loop, and that's how you unlock Rogue.Passive-All Rad Canisters become ammunition for her Portal Strike, and she's chased by the IDPDActive-Portal StrikeThe last two characters in the mod, Skeleton and Frog, though playable in the original game, they are hidden. Skeleton is only playable by being killed in a Necromancer's circle, and Frog is only playable by saving the Golden Frog Pistol to a character(which is no simple task).SkeletonPassive-4 HP, slowActive-Shoot for no armor at the potential loss of healthFrogPassive-Can't stop, won't stop tryna make the booty drop. Also, he can't be effected by toxic items.Active-Stops moving and begins charging a fart, which will poison anything that enters the toxic cloudSo, yeah, that's about it.I rate this game 9/11, too many cars exploding.

												On the first look this game felt like cheap rubbish. I'm so glad that i gave it a chance.. it has become one of my favourites! It's frustrating and devastating in the beginning. You'll find yourself ragequitting and hating on the game because it seems so freaking impossible, unfair and totaly imbalanced! Now guess what, you'll improve as you keep playing. You will handle the impossible at some point and look back with a grin as you're figuring out the game's depth and master it's mechanics. Nuclear Throne is on point. None if the items, weapons or characters are useless. It offers a healthy challenge and rewards you with a feeling of actually having achieved something when something was achieved. You can feel the hours of work these developers put into it for balancing it out and once you did the game will be with you for the rest of your time filling out the empty hours when there's nothing else to enjoy. Just buy it, there's no regrets!			"

								WARNING!!!         IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO BUY THIS GAME READ CAREFULLY THIS REVIEW!!! Introduction This game is made to apeal to really small audience.Its very hard and it will probably destroy your sanity if you dont have experience with top-down shooters.(even if you played anyone of the hotline miami games,it will be very challenging).Even as an eperienced gamer in this type of games the SMALLEST MISTAKE can end a very powerful run.You can be at full HP but still die in seconds to explosions or by touching sth with a lot of contat dmg,This game also doesnt have invinsibility frames meaning that you can get hit by 10 proectiles in 0,01sec.You will probably die by every enemy 5 times until you learn their paterns.If you have weak psychology dont try this game!!!GameplayThe games is very fair when it comes to ammo and health drops.It may sometimes spawn you in a difficult position surounded by enemies but with enought practice you will be able to survive them even with the starting weapon and no Mutations.The main objective of the game is to beat th NUCLEAR THRONE and survive as long as you can after that.Its a bullethell game so remember that u need to be focused on shooting as much as on doging the projectiles,which is hard after all.After you beat the throne u will have to repeat the game from the start with MORE enemies and Secret Bosses for each area.After killing an enemy he will drop RADS with are used to level up.Leveling up lets you chose a Mutation which will help you in the game like more more HP morebigger ammo capasity etc.You can chose one of 4 randomly given to you mutations after finishing the aeria (if you leveled up)Pros and ConsPros-Great Retro graphics-Nice music and weapon sounds-Challenging and adictive (countless hours of playing)-Tons of Playable characters wth unique abilities and passives-Fair but difficult health system -Balanced weapons -A lot of improvements and updates-Requires a lot of skill (luck matters only in 5% of the games sytuation)-Lots of weapons (more than 100 for sure)-A good amount of mutations to pick from (about 20)Cons-Small audience-Still has bugs since its in eary accessOverall ReviewIts a 10/10 game for the small audience that it targets.You will not find it fun if you rage easilybecause the smallest mistake can end your run.I have 300hrs in this game in total on multiple acc andits my Favourite game.As to the ''would you reccomend it thing'' i have mixed feelings just because of the difficulity of the game,but if you really love challenging games then this one should apeal to you.Have fun!!!

								Amazing.Nuclear Throne is a rogue-like top-down action type of game, which has the player charging through randomly generated levels and fighting of hordes of bandits and various other mutated monsters.As the name suggests, Nuclear Throne takes place in a mutated world. You, the player has a choice of 12 balanced characters to try and reach the Nuclear Throne, the final boss and name of the game. In terms of gameplay, this game takes the cake. In earlier levels, things will seem boring, with safe spawns and easy victories. But progress further and you will see that things change very quickly. Later places such as the Frozen City are jam-packed with enemies, and your only hope is to keep moving.The player is also on the hunt for radiation. If you manage to collect enough, you can mutate. Each mutation has its strengths and weaknesses, and work well in specific situations, and this is what, in my opinion, gives the game an extra kick. Picking random mutations can get you killed, so choose wisely.With the many weapon choices, bosses bound to keep you on your toes and mutations that can either save you or kill you, this game can get intense. I wouldn't recommend this to people who aren't trying to game on the edge, and would rather stick to calmer titles. But for the gamers on the edge who want a fast-paced thriller, this is a much recommended game for you.			"

While Early-Access games are normally untrustworthy, Nuclear Throne is an exception. With simplistic, but charming visuals and difficult gameplay, Nuclear Throne is a great game to play to kill time or keep you away from your friends and family for a while. Reccommended for any gamer who's prepared to die and willing to push to see that radioactive chair.			"

								Really addictive, and rightfully so. This game throws you into action immediately and can just as fast throw you out of it. It's fast, it's unforgiving and it's brutally challenging. It is everything a roguelike game should be.With a devoted team of developers updates arrive weekly with new features, bugfixing and balancing. Vlambeer also hosts a weekly stream on twitch with development process as well as responding to comments and complains about the game to make sure the audience is pleased with this work in progress masterpiece.When i first purchased this game i didn't play anything else for a good week or two, not only because there is a lot of ways to play the game (characters, weapons, upgrades etc.) but also because i was driven to see just how far i could get. See when the last boss is defeated you replay the game with the same items and upgrades, only now it's balls to the wall hard. That's where the real difficulty begins.Being in early access means it just keeps getting better, so i suggest purchasing it now to witness the small changes that improve the game every week. You will hate this game, then you'll love it, then you'll die to that annoying-♥♥♥ enemy and you'll hate it again. But when you loop for the first time and get that sick run with thousands of kills, you'll love it forever.#VerifyVenuz			"

												I first got this game back in February after seeing some streams on Twitch. Little did I know what I was getting in to. As soon as it was done downloading I launched the game and already there it had already beaten me. As my ears were bleeding from the startup screen's scream of the death of a million mutants of the wasteland. That first ""FLÄÄSHYN!"" as you launch up the game will forever haunt my dreams.After adjusting the settings accordingly I went and selected Fish in the character selection and off we were. Who would've thought maggots would become my most feared enemy in any video game. And I rolled, and I rolled, and I rolled... And yet the same sentence kept popping up in my head; ""Fish can roll.""As hours went by and I got better at the game. I discovered new and exciting enemies, weapons, bosses and of course everyone's beloved 'Vlambeer Certified SAFE SPAWN©™'. But never ones did my mind falter from my one true goal: to reach the Nuclear Throne.So many mutants have died, so many bullets have been fired and so many bizarre bugs have helped me throughout my journey. After many tries and defeats I had reached my goal. The Nuclear Throne.After a long a tedious battle I had accomplished my goal. I had reached the Nuclear Throne. I had defeated the Nuclear Throne.

								Nuclear Throne is a neat, twin-stick-shooting rogue-like, it's super fast paced, challenging, and a ton of fun to play. I'd mostly relate the gameplay to that of a randomized Hotline Miami, but with a variety of characters and run-based upgrades. The art style is great and the sound/music design is even better.Vlambeer is a wonderful development company and seem to be handling Early Access incredibly well, they definitely deserve your time. Check out their other stuff too, specifically LUFTRAUSERS and Ridiculous Fishing, all of their games are filled with charm and relatively unique, enjoy.			"

Soon enough it becomes a part of you, you eat, sleep, and breathe nuclear throne.

								If you have even a passing interest in top-down shooters or roguelites/roguelike-likes, play this game. Even if you don't, I would strongly urge you to consider it anyway. This is one of the most fantastically executed games I have played in my life. Yes, it is in early access, and I will possibly revise this review once the game is fully released (The game currently does not have all the planned content implemented, and there are some bugs and balance issues), but I seriously doubt that my opinion of it will change to anything other than even greater love.On paper, everything seems pretty swell. The soundtrack is great. The presentation is absolutely incredible. Even the game's setting is very original and oddly intriguing, with a more cartoon-like, but still fairly gritty approach to the post-apocalypse aesthetic, complete with such details as an (admittedly not yet fully fleshed out) original language and hints to some fairly complex plot elements.In practice though, the game is even better. So, so much better. Nuclear Throne was built from the ground up to be as responsive and as visceral as possible. This is done through many seemingly insignificant factors such as attack animations, sound effects, and screen shake (which can be turned down, but unless you suffer from serious motion sickness, you're doing yourself a disservice by doing so). Combined with the considerable variety of weapons and fairly expansive character roster (both of which are still being added to), this creates a gameplay experience that is absolutely greater than the sum of its parts. Playing Nuclear Throne is enjoyable in ways that descriptions and even gameplay videos can't fully portray, because everything about the game is created to be satisfying on a psychological level.Also worth noting, the devs everything a independent development can and should ever be. Being in early access, the game is updated around once a week, and the developers are always active on the message boards, receptive to suggestions, and perfectly transparent. Buy the game.			"

I really like that the game has secret levels, characters and guns for people to find.

In later levels and loops the freezeframes and the game will slow down because all of the stuff on screen.* Balancing : As for now the balance for characters and weapons are pretty good but what does have to be toned down is melee and or enemies who spam alot of bullets in the later games it will become a huge problem and it gets very hard to get trough it without melee.

								Everything Vlambeer develops ends up turning into gold. This game, even being early access, is my favorite Vlambeer title to date.  Think Hotline Miami meets rogue-like mutant monster infested wastelands. Awesome weapons, mutant upgrade. Gameplay is tight. I love the way the game camera moves. If you don't hold up well with camera shake they give you the option to adjust it under settings. Should also mention the soundtrack is kickass and fits perfect with the game's universe.  Looking back at their history of releases this should be no suprise. Lots of replay value. Good luck surviving long enough to getting to the Nuclear Throne. Highly recommended.			"

								(Just a note:This game is way more difficult than Binding of Issac). So this game is about 12 mutants fighting through 7 well designed levels to the Nuclear Throne. I have played this game for long enough to say that you have a 100% chance of death in this. Runs aren't meant to last forever, as entering a portal increases the difficulty by 1 every time. That makes more monsters spawn.  You can have over 40 weapons of melee, bullets, energy, bolts, shells and explosives. They each can be intresting to use. When you level up, you get to choose 4 mutations. They are randomly set. I have no complaints about this game, yet it might be difficult at first.			"

												First of all, this game is very hard. I don't reccomend pcking up the game unless you are an expert at bullet hells. Feel free to try it out even if you don't like shooters, because it is a lot of fun. This game has been in early access for a little over two years, and being almost finished, Nucleaar Throne is getting better and better. What this game has:~10 unlockable characters, each with unique gameplay and abilities~Daily runs to test yur skill against other players for leaderboard highscore~Over 110 weapons to use~Looping feature for infinite gameplay~Bosses, each with a different stragety of killing youand many more features!Overall Nuclear Throne is a great game that challenges players to reach the throne over and over again, while also getting better weapons, newer strageties, and dodging skills. I have been playing this game since a year after it came out in early access, and it has a special place in my heart. Anyway, good luck, and have fun!			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic, gorgeous sprite art,  fun game play, high replay value, challenging, great sound track, and just all around a fantastic time for those who enjoy bullet hell style gameplay.  Sometimes the map generated or the area in which you spawn can be frustrating because a level might be incredibly difficult with a bad spawn (ie no cover surrounded by enemies) and easy with a good spawn (cover, space between you and enemies.)  However with randomly generated maps this is bound to be an issue and if you get a bad spawn and die you just start over as always.  With a game like this it takes a  lot of practice and patience, I wouldn't reccomend this game if you're not prepared to put in the time to build up your skills in order to advance.  However if you are willing to put in a lot of practice then I find it very rewarding with unlockable characters, items, skins, and secret areas as you progress towards the nuclear throne.  Overall I definitely think it's worth the money and then some.			"

								Hey, I have an idea! Let's select our favorite adorably creepy radioactive misfit and take the fight to a meddlesome group of rogues and abominations, all the while loading up on weapons and mutating to adapt to a dystopian hellscape! Sound good? Hell yeah, it does! Oldschool graphics, a soundtrack that inspires the ol' desperado frame of mind, a great variety of characters, weapons and enemies and the ability to mutate with each new level are some of the many perks of fighting your way through a post-apocalyptic wasteland, trying to get yourself a little farther than you got last time! This is one of those rare games in which you die... A LOT... and yet, it never seems to get on your nerves when you do! It just makes you want to give it one more go! I can honestly say that I've been an exhausted wreck for work on more than one occasion due to wanting one more bid for the throne! ...Whether that's a positive criticism on the game or a negative one for my own sense of priority, I'll have to get back to you on. Point being, this game is highly addictive and an adrenaline rush! Whether you're looking to spend a day at it, or just kill a few minutes before having to be somewhere, it's an all-around winner! I'd recommend this game like I'd recommend eating food on a regular basis: it just makes sense to do so, and you're ony hurting yourself to contradict! 10/10!			"

								Nuclear Throne is a top down rogue-like shooter set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland featuring animal mutants as the stars of the show. There is some backstory to be had there, but it's out of the way once the game starts up. And boy, is there a game to be had.Staple to Vlambeer's output, the game features hugely satisfying combat - with shots giving out appropriate amounts of screen shake, freeze frames and audio feedback upon pulling the trigger. You'll learn to love the impact of the shotguns and the sniper like efficiency of the crossbow. The weapons have been given loving amounts of attention, between tweaking, balancing and playtesting there is bound to be something for everyone.  The levels themselves are randomly generated, akin to the way Spelunky or other games of that ilk work. You'll have to navigate through several themed worlds, amassing rads (experience) and weapons along the way. The experience unlocks perks - gameplay perks you'll have to decide upon, the majority of which can greatly shape your playstyle and tactics. Defensive and offensive options abound for the players who like to play safe or for those who need more risk and reward. You'll find yourself on one hand (or two if you're playing Steroids) wielding increasingly massive amounts of firepower, while coping with the snowballing odds. Bands of enemies become hordes, and you'll find yourself in pure glee as you lay waste to everything before your eyes. Nothing can stand between you and victory, noth...oh wait. Death again. The game is hard, and you'll initially find yourself inching to survive. You'll have to observe individual enemy behaviors, learn to understand the baiting nature of the game, and capitalize on every bit of terrain on the battlefield. With enough time you'll find yourself at the Nuclear Throne...only to loop the game and turn up the difficulty to 11. The game features, single and local co-op action (still WIP), with dailies to add something to come back to everyday. I await the final release with (fish) baited breath.			"

												This is the shortened version of my original Slovak review, which can be found here:http://www.madhouse.sk/152/nuclear-throneIt's a pretty quick traslation, so I apologize if it's not perfect.Rather than explaining the basic mechanics, I'll only talk about what I personally think is good and bad with Nuclear Throne. Steam won't let me post the full review anyway. If this is still too long for you, skip to the conclusion at the end.____Nuclear Throne might seem like a shallow indie title at first...and you could not be more wrong for thinking that. There's a surprising amount of depth, which is the reason why it's still fun to play, after the amount of hours I've put into it.Even though it is one of those games that I really love, and I do recommend it, it needs to be said that THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. This game is hardcore. Many people claim that it's the most difficult and the most frustrating game they have ever played. SO..if you aren't into rogue-lite and bullet hell, you can stop reading right now. If proceduraly generated content is not your thing, or you are not particularly skilled FPS player (even thought that entire genre), it may be hard for you to really enjoy chaotic nature of Nuclear Throne. However…if things mentioned above check all your boxes, and you feel strong enough to overcome first several hours full of frustration, then feel free to continue reading.Organized chaos (the good)There are many thing that I like about Nuclear Throne. The thing that stands out the most to me is not the sheer amount of content and possibilities, but the way they've tied it all together. The game has many ways how to keep you moving and thinking, and punishes you for every misstep you make. This is the level of depth and that special ""something"", that will have you coming back over and over again.Despite the random nature of the game, I found Nuclear Throne to be more skill based, than, let's say BoI or Risk of Rain. Sure, those games are a lot of fun…when you get the right drops. At least, that's my take on it. Nuclear Throne takes part of that problem away. You won't ever be completely OP, because the game is so unfair, that mutations don't make all that much of a difference…and they certainly won't get you to the throne by themself. And if you're good enough, even with bad build, you can have a great run. You're getting better yourself, your skills get better. Doesn't matter if RNG has a bad day. Also, let's not forget to mention sound design, that is perfect. Everything, and I mean everything in this game, has it's own sound. Once you'll get into, it will help you a great deal to understand what the hell is going on on the screen. I can't stress enough how important this is in the game, where you can get killed by something you can't see at the moment. Also, soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing great, and I still listen to it from time to time even when not playing.The last big possitive, that is kind of hard to describe, is the overall gameplay and the feel of the game. That's something that Vlambeer excells at, and you will know what I mean if you've played Luftrausers or Super Crate Box. Controls are tight, everything feels right even though you are not sure why. There's something very visceral about the wa it plays. And the most important thing - the gameplay is fun, even though you are not very good at the game yet.""It's not fair, it's not right."" (the bad)It's little bit hard for me to talk about what's bad here, because I see the game differently after the time I've spend playing it. But I'll try my best.The biggest downside to this game may be the time you have to put in, to actually get skilled enough and be able to see more, than just first couple of levels. That's pretty funny, because this is actually game that you can play, when you have just a couple of minutes to kill. Playthoughs last 10-15 minutes, of course they can strech to hour or more, as you get better and better. To fully explain what I'm trying to say here - I've beaten throne for the first time after playing the game for 60 hours. SIXTY. That just may be too much for some. That said, I'm someone who can get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ very much, very quickly…so if it wasn't fun for me to try and beat the game, I would ditch it half a year ago. Also, the whole game is locked on 30 FPS, which may seem like a terrible idea for a game as frantic as this one. Not only that, but there are times, where the framerate dips even lower, because there's just too much stuff going on at the same time. Now, I know this may sound stupid to you, but I don't mind any of that. Freezeframes are an actual feature of the game (no, really). They are actually helpful, as they give you those fractions of the second to realize what's going on and act accordingly. BUT, I know some may have problems with that, so that's why I'm telling you about it. Also, I don't know what's up with that 4:3 format. At the time of writing this, we are at update 97. As of now, there are still some bugs; also daily/weekly modes are pretty much unplayable, since leaderboards don't work. That said, I believe that Vlambeer will fix this as soon as they can. Nuclear Throne is imo one of the best examples of Early Access done right…Last, but not least - the game is ridiculously unfair at times. You will encounter situations that seem absolutely hopeless, because they really are. And even though the game lets you try different play styles, some just won't work very well…and that's a bit frustrating, to say the least.ConclusionNuclear Throne is the best game in it's genre imho, and my personal GOTY. If you're looking for a hardcore shooter, that will provide you with endless hours of fun and tears, for the price, this is the best deal. Despite being procedurally generated, it doesn't feel completely random and your success actually depends on your skills, and not just RNG. However, it will take you a great amount of time to reach the throne, and that might just be too much to swallow for some.Nuclear Throne covers the surprising amount of depth behind it's cute, yet weird pixel-art aestetic. But once you get into it, every beaten boss will be one of the most rewarding videogame experiences. You'll try again and again…and with the amount of content and replayability, you definitely can! But as I've mentioned before, this game is not easy, and it sure as hell isn't fair. You have to be the special kind of masochist to truly understand the beauty of Nuclear Throne. Rating: 9/10+ amount of content and replayability+ fun, arcade-like gameplay+ guns and mutations+ sound design - daily/weekly not working (at the moment)- occasional bugs- sometimes ridiculously unfair			"

								Nuclear Throne in a nutshell: ""you can play as a katana-wielding rambo chicken mutant who can slow down time!""..now why would you not want this?I've never been that addicted to a game since super mario or zelda on NES back in the days. the pixel art is gorgeous, the colors are bright, the character design and their special abilities are genius, and they keep adding stuff like new sound effects, characters, levels and weapons every week. this is in early access but it already kicks ♥♥♥. not a single playthrough will be the same, since the levels are randomly generated. there's a mutant for every playstyle from easy to hard. you will probably suck at the beginning, but you will learn to get better by trial and error. the only thing this game misses right now are more modes for more variety.just BUY IT already.. played 70 hours so far, it's awesome.

												This game is a top down twin stick shooter with rouge-like elements. Each and every play through is never the same. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. I mean really hard. This is the Dark Souls of twin stick shooters. Each map randomly generates the field and weapons are also generate randomly depending how far you gotten. Example, in the beginning you get random low tier weapons from chests as in higher levels you get higher tier weapons. The enemies get stronger the further you go and you have to play it smart by finding cover. This game requires some skill and a lot of luck. More than half the time I either die from being spawned in the worst spot on the field or accidentally kill myself with a grenade launcher or some explosive weapon. Either because I was being dumb or the enemy was too close by running towards you. This game may be hard but it's a lot of fun. Great soundtrack, very responsive controls, my only complaint is that there is no online co-op mode. There is local co-op but no online. Still it's a great game and addicting. It's a 8.5/10 for me.

												Brutal, unforgiving, HARD AS HELL. This game hits all the right switches for a fantastic roguelike shooter. Probably one of my favorite games of all time. This game has a steep learning curve, endless replay value (in my opinon), a boatload of content, especially in the ""post game"" parts. While ""post game"" really is just the start to the game. Excellent gunplay, weapons feel unique, satisfying and most of all, powerful. A 12 character roster (technically 14) with their own unique active and passive abilties. Add to that a heap of ""mutations"" aka perks that can help you during your run, going from the run of the mill stuff like ""Extra Health"" to ""Hit Bullets have a chance to recover instantly"" can allow you to play around certain weapon types, making you the king of the wasteland. Though it may seem brutal at the start it gets a lot better once you get better at it. It's one of those games that you start a round of at 10pm, then end up at 3am and hating yourself for loving it. Absolutely reccomended, unless you hate shooters, hard games or roguelikes.			"

Almost all the weapons have that really good ""oomph"" to them to which consists of their sound and the actual impact they have ingame, so if you're one of those people that likes your videogame weapons to sound and feel impactful, you'll be satisfied. If you like twin stick shooters (ala Geometry wars) and Rougelites/likes like FTL or Isaac I can almost guarantee you will love this game.also there are airhornsand fish can roll			"

								Nuclear Throne is a fast paced top-down shooter with rogue-like elements.It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where everything is out to get you, including crows with SMGs and rats. So many rats. This game is pretty hard but obviously the more you play the better you get and also the more knowledge you obtain to better your next run. There is a vast amount of weaponry from average pistols to poison grenade launchers and rifles that literally shoot lightning. An average Nuclear Throne run looks like this: To start, there is a flurry of bullets coming towards you. As you continue, you get better weapons but the enemies get stronger and shoot MORE bullets towards you. Every few levels, you find a boss that has considerably more health than everyone else, and seem to only spawn when you are in a pinch and surrounded by enemies.In short, this game has a surprising amount of story to it and the developers update it almost every week, not to mention the music is awesome and there are secret levels everywhere. What more could you ask for?			"

								Incredibly fun and addictive roguelike-like with a great selection of weapons and upgrades. Every character has their own unique trait which comes in handy for different kinds and levels of players, as well as makes for a creative ground to come up with various strategies. Controls are smooth and responsive (Y.V.s airhorn is a neat bonus). The graphics look great, lovely character design, colors feel well thought out, and the music is super nice and draws me right in. I wouldn't mind buying the soundtrack for listening to while I work! I couldn't recommend this game more. If you like this genre, you'll love Nuclear Throne.			"

												Vlambeer makes yet another game about aiming weapons with a variety of patterns to kill fast-moving enemies that can slay you in a heartbeat, dying to something unexpected, and starting over.This one has roguelike trappings with procedural generation and such: making do with the weapons you find is fun; choosing from the random perk sets is okay, but the choice is seldom as difficult as I'd like; and the level generation is actually pretty unimpressive.

Vicious, gritty, filled to brim with character and challenge and death. Some people may play games as a sort of therapy, but most will need it after wittnessing this masterpiece. Guns upon guns upon guns (with melee weapons), a good selection of classes from a roided-out scientist that can duel wield to a cute little robot that can eat guns for health and ammo. You will rage, you will cry, and you'll come back playing, because when you play Nuclear Throne, you live it. You aren't a person controlling the mutant, you are the mutant. You gain the urges, the lust, and the will to traverse outward on your bloody pilgrimage. To make things right, many must fall, including you, but take heart, and the stars will aline in your favor. Every night by the campfire, every gun you pick up, every foe that drops in your wake is one step closer to reaching...the Nuclear Throne.Let's do this.Edit: It is finally complete and I'm still coming back after a year of playing.

								I've been playing this game off-and-on for a couple of years now and it just keeps getting better. Vlambeer is a great studio and this may be my favorite game in their stellar line-up. Nuclear Throne is a shoot-em-up rogue-like where you battle for the throne in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.Paul Veers artwork is really something special and just getting to see his designs serves as plenty of motivation to progress to the next stage. There is some great character design in this game. The mutants are colorful, varied and fun. As it stands, the game is already well worth the price of admission and Vlambeer is just going to keep adding to it as time goes on.			"

""♥♥♥♥ing rats, they're everywhere."" *Puts on shades* ""Well, looks like this is a going out of life sale, everything must die.""-----Nuclear Throne, what do you need to about it? Well, the description up there will tell you that it is a top-down Rogue-like shooter where you play as one of a selection of mutants, each searching for the, you guessed it, Nuclear Throne.Each level of the game is visually unique, with it's own traps, objects, and enemies. Be warned, however, if you do play this game you will come to loathe the following:MaggotsGiant ScorpionsSewer Rats♥♥♥♥ing Sniper RobotsYeti-RobotsThe IDPD (Inter-Dimensional Police Department)Those are totally all the real names guys, totally.However, the first time that you reach the end, defeat the final boss (twice, of course), you'll feel an amazing joy in knowing that you beat the game, that you reached the end and that there is nothing left to opp-Wait, it does what when you beat the final boss?(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ I'M OUTOriginally posted by Jayellow:10/10, great game.

								At first glance, the game may look simplistic, possibly even not worth the buy.  But in my opinion, every fan of rouglikes such as FTL, RoR or BoI should have this game in their library.  My playtime can not even reflect the amount of devotion I have poured into this game, but the game gives back.  The sense of achivement, the sense of skill you feel once you beat a certain boss for the first time, or you finally learn how to play a certain character...  it's an amazing feeling.  And what delivers that feeling?  Nuclear Throne.  This is one of my favorite games of all time, and it always will be.  Again, I highly suggest you buy this game.  Thank you for this soul-consuming masterpiece, Vlambeer.  -10/10			"

												I bought this game a while ago and was very skeptical of throwing money at a unfinished game that looked promising but I like many of us have been burned before at the hype, smoke and mirrors style of game advertisers (the magician that takes your money and shows no magic).I went in skeptical and finished a true believer, this game PC MASTER RACE ( < elitist group think), this game is the absolute bombastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balls to the walls style chaotic shooting role playing experience. now I've hyped it I'll tell you the goods and badsUPDATE!!!!!!!!!the awesome.- The weaponage. so much thought and effort went into the weapon system, the developers obviously did their homework and listened to community feedback. There is a Tier weapon system that RNGs your loot, early on regular weapons of 5 different types of ammo will do. Later as the challenge builds you will find better weapons (some skills will boost specific weapons or help build a character e.g around a super auto crosbow) to spray the next battlefield and dodge like a ninja. Once you learn the secrets you can get hyper weapons which as robot means sweet nutrition and a skin. I got two portals to open giving me better gun tech on top of my passive ability, dodged the throne enough and obliterated it with my incredible power, skills and weaponage. all of which felt like a great triumph. yet theres so much more to learn.- Variational gameplay. meaning it's rng. different evertime but sweetly similar, the replayability jumps again at the number of different characters with different styles... I miss the chicken freeze time ability. but consitently you will get better weapons as the game gets harder. none of that binding of issac lame power ups as the game gets harder.- THE DIFFICULTY. It's hard, unforgiving like your parents when they caught you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ an apple pie, but that's a good thing because you learn from your mistakes and get better at ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the pie. which makes the expierence all the more rewarding. If you get caught with your pants down it is mainly your own fault-The Graphics.that perfect mix of low fi cartoon style but defined well that you can see all the detailed pixel art. there are points that the chaos is too much but that's hardly bad. they got rid of that crappy screen shake problem, and it all flows smoothly, like a waterfall of caramelly chocolate goodness and rainbows wrapped in ♥♥♥♥♥♥s straight into your eyeballs.- The charaters and Power upseach character has a unique special ability, all the characters are fun to play and add layers to a already big onion. there's a secret throne room that offers different crowns of game changing awesomeness. after you level you get a moment in the spining vortew to pick a perk that enhances your characters traits. there will always be atleast 2 good power ups for the type of character your building and it's fun to grow stronger as the game does. the difficulty is still tough but unless you can't handle the heat, the food your cookings tasty. - IT IS FUNalot of games miss that crucial component. it is fun, I've played alot of this game and it's still fun and I still haven't finished it cause that boss with the jetpack and crazy gun kills me so fast. one moment I'm a mutated fish rolling on the ground the next I'm a mutated fish NOT rolling on the ground. such a powerful image even a child could understand it.fun, so much fun it's the very definition of fun gameplayTHE ♥♥♥♥- some small bugs, like the game wont start for me for some updates. but then it does. this is a minor issue and won't matter when they finish it. its still getting better and better. i hope it becomes the masterpiece it could potentially be- the tipsduring loading screens they give you tips, while some like ""don't die"" or ""don't be afraid"" are funny and even motivating to push yourself further. at some point there should be a deeper guide that you dont have to buy or search for seperately- the chickenneeds a better power up(it's much better now, still not my favourite but a cool character. Throwing your weapons to save ammo or in desperation is excellent and another example of the devs taking note)in summary buy this game because it's awesome and a great investment in time killing. even now with the early access it's worth twice the asking price.UPDATE!I FINISHED THIS MONSTOSITYconclusion is 40% learning from mistakes through masochistic dying. 10 % accuracey, concentration and dodging 10% concentrated power of will. 40% luck and funno replayability cause it was some guerilla warfare pain.UPDATE 2.0This is almost everything i wanted and i had high hopes. would like more secrets or DLC but well worth supporting it. I've played hundreds of hours and enjoyed every single one damn nearly. well done to the team that made this, well darn done.			"

								Welcome to Nuclear Throne, and this is a review for it. As for now, Nuclear Throne is a early-access rogue-like indie game, that receives weekly updates to make the game more balanced and fun, as well as adding a lot of stuff. It still has loads of planned features, so if you decide to get the game, stick around it for a while, or come back to it from times to times to always have new experiences with it.Now starting from the game: You open the game to be welcomed by a very enjoyable soundtrack, as well as the character selection menu for it. You start the game with a few characters, but as you progress through it, you will unlock more of them, and at the time of this review, they are pretty easy to unlock. Every character has a passive and active ability, the active ability being used by pressing the right button of the mouse once in-game. It's also recommended you try every character, since they all play differently.Once you select a character, you are ready to go. You will find yourself with a weapon at hands, surrounded by enemies in the middle of a nuclear wasteland. Your objective is to use the weapons and abilities on your arsenal to kill all the enemies in the area to activate a portal, leading to the next level. You quest is to reach a throne, collecting radiation on your way to mutate yourself and turn into a even more powerful being, as well as collecting new weapons, which can be divided by:-Bullet weapons-Shell weapons-Bolt weapons-Explosive weapons-Energy weapons-Melee weapons(note that all the weapon types listed above have their own ammo, and also their own sub categories, but that use the same ammo type)The gameplay is very simple. You spawn in a area, filled with enemies, and the random generated levels could get you easily, so keep an eye open. Sometimes it could be very easy but in other occasions, it might just swarm you with foes, leaving you to die right after spawning. The game can also be frustrating at the time, since the chances of you being a master right off the start are very small, so you can expect to die a lot, but it's all part of the game, everytime you play it and die, you grow better at it for learning how to deal with enemies carefully. Keep an eye on your ammo, as you might run out pretty quickly with certain weapons, and don't forget to choose your mutations wisely.Wrapping everything up, I'd give Nuclear Throne a 10/10 for being an awesome game. Awesome soundtrack, challenging gameplay, and an frustrating, yet enjoyable, expirience. I'd recommend going to the game's Wiki[nuclear-throne.wikia.com] for more in-depth information about the game's development and already implemented features. Remember once again that the game might not be enjoyable right away for some people not used to this kind of game, rogue-likes tend to be difficult and require patience to play and master "

												TL;DR: BUY THIS GAME.I really love this game!It's a fast paced roguelike shooter in which the goal is to get to the 'Nuclear Throne' by advancing through different randomly generated levels. I've only got about 2.3 hours into the game but I play it every day and I love it!All of the classes are nicely balancedI love the fact that you can watch Vlambeer's livestreams every Tuesday and Thursday where they add new contentI really like how the game itself is set up!I bought the predecessor 'Wasteland Kings' in the Mojam 2 Humble bundle, and found out about the improved version at the Indie Developer booth at Minecon :)I reccomend this game to anyone who has some money to spend on an awesome game!EDIT: It's been 6 months since I purchased the game and I do not regret it. There was a large gap of time in which I didn't play the game, but a couple of updates put me back into it. I've gotten around 11 hours into this game in 6 months, which isn't really that much because of the length of time that I have owned this game. Even though I'm absolutely horrible at this game and cannot get past Big Dog (the second boss) I still love it to death and won't stop playing it until the development stops on it. The devs really make this game awesome, doing livestreams for players to know that their hard-earned money has not gone to waste, sometimes going onto the livestreams of their community, actually responding to questions on the steam community hub, and doing constant updates. All of this stuff makes me want to play the game, be it because of the new content or just that I'm supporting awesome devs.EDIT 2: It's been more than a year and a half since I purchased the game. I only have 60 hours in it and suck but it's one of my favorite games. The devs are awesome and the game is great, it's worth your money. I definitely recommend it.EDIT 3: It's been more than two years since I have purchased this game, it has now been fully released. This game is definitely STILL WORTH IT, and I've enjoyed every minute of my playtime, even if most of my deaths were due to BS like Golden Snow Tanks. Verdict: BUY IT.			"

								Nuclear Throne is an addictive and hard Rogue-Like, which is still in Early Access. At first the game may not look like a really good game but once you progress and find new weapons it starts to grow on you. The idea behind the game is simple; Kill everything on the map and continue to the next level. You pick one of the (currently) 12 characters, each character got his own perks and abilities. When you level up you may choose a new perk. Your character can hold 2 weapons at the time so you have to make decisions which to hold. The game is hard so each time you progress feels like a victory, also there are portals which lead you to special vaults and locations.Anyone that doesn't mind a hard game and enjoys rogue-likes should pick this up.

												Part Rogue-like, Part RPG, part bullet-hell -- this game has a lot of charm and is quite addictive. Deceptively complex when you get down to the business of different levels and enemies and all the perks and weapon combinations you might use to prevail. I tried my darndest, but I could never win -- I'd gotten far, and I consider it a point of honor to win Rogue-likes that I love... but maybe someday I'll come back and try to beat it. In the meantime I had fun playing with multiple characters that actually play differently, and some great fun winning levels in crushing victory or by the skin of my teeth. Nuclear Throne, you have earned a place in my heart... a game that beat me, but I loved you anyway. <3			"

								I decided to pick up this game in the summer of 2013, around when update 34 was implemented. I had followed this game for quite a while but was never able to pick it up until then. I managed to rack up so many hours so fast, that my friends became worried and tried to talk to me about it. I told a few of them to try it out, and now they're addicted to this game. My friends who play it have developed a small ""cult"" and it seems like anyone who listens in on our conversations thinks we are the strangest people. It is now update 95 and so much has changed in this game. I can always find new and interesting ways to get better, more fun combinations of weapons, mutations, and crowns. I seriously cannot recommend this game enough to anyone. If you are feeling on the edge of getting it but are being hesitant, the developers have stated that the price will go down once this game is out of early access. Please, this game cannot be anymore hype.			"

								An amazing game. The endless fast paced action and large amount of weapons keeps the gameplay fresh, with the ""mutations"" allowing you to change up your playstyle along with the large amount of different characters, each with its own unique abilities.10/10			"

This review is created for  My Curation Page.  Skip to the bottom for my Final ThoughtsI purchased this game as a part of the Humble Freedom BundleNuclear Throne is a frantic post-apocalyptic rogue-like shooter bullet hell set in a universe inhabited by mutants and monsters. Made by the same developers who made games such as Super Crate Box and Luftrausers, Nuclear Throne is yet another notch on the belt of great games by Vlambeer.GraphicsNuclear Throne sports pixel art 2D graphics, with each world being unique and completely different. The setting of the game differs between contrasting enviornments such as a desert wasteland and a frozen city. There are many different types of enemies which all look unique as well as menacing, as well as bosses in certain areas in each playthrough, each with completely differing looks related to their enviornment (my favorite is Big Dog). From bugs to robots, from rats to crystals, Nuclear Throne has a wide variety of odds and ends from all corners of fiction. Audio & SoundtrackNuclear Throne has very nice adventurous music that really helps set the tone of the game. You don't want to listen to boring orchestral music as you fight your way through nuclear wastelands since the rhythm and speed of the music doesn't match the frantic bullet hell style of Nuclear Throne. For the first couple playthroughs of Nuclear Throne, you'll be hearing a lot of the same music because every Area uses one or two different tracks. If you spend a lot of time in say, the first Area, you'll be hearing a lot of the same music, but as you progress deeper and deeper towards the end, you'll hear all sorts of music made by the wonderful composer ""Jukio Kuabee Kalio"".GameplayNuclear Throne is a frantic roguelike bullet-hell game that keeps you on your toes and the edge of your seat. One mistake can very well be your last mistake in a playthrough. If you get yourself into a sticky situation, surrounded by enemies, it may very well be your chance to say goodbye to that playthrough. There are many different types of playable characters, with my favourite being ""Crystal"". Every character has different abilities that you can use with your right mouse button. For example, Crystal can shield himself for a short period, deflecting some shots back at the shooter. As I mentioned before, some areas have their own boss. For example the first Area, the desert, has Big Bandit, who shoots a machine gun and dashes through walls. The further you get into the game, you unlock chances to unlock a Crown, an item that alters the flow of the game that also bears consequences.StorylineThe storyline of the game is mainly told to you through small snippets of exposition in the load screens. If you are looking for a deeper take of the Nuclear Throne storyline, you'll have to go to the Nuclear Throne wikia and look at the trivia for characters or bosses. I would like the story aspect of Nuclear Throne so much more if there was little bits of exposition, say, after you defeat a boss. I would really love to know the backstory for Big Dog, my favorite boss in Nuclear Throne. Final ThoughtsOverall, I really enjoy playing Nuclear Throne. You can easily pick up a game and play for a few minutes, but you could also easily find yourself into a 30 minute or longer playthrough. If you are a fan of bullet hell or roguelike games, then I think you'd enjoy playing Nuclear Throne, however, if you are looking for a game with a deep story, then Nuclear Throne most likely isn't for you (unless you can swallow the storyline aspect and just enjoy the explosions and bullets). I can definitely see myself playing Nuclear Throne to completion more and more in the near future.Rating:Graphics: 8.1/10Audio: 7.6/10Gameplay: 8.4/10Overall: 8.0/10Enjoy the review?

Early Access Review
								Before you drop your money on this game you need to be aware of something very, very important about Nuclear Throne: this is probably one of the most difficult and frustrating games you've ever encountered.I'm not giving this a thumbs-down because the game is terrible, it's a good game.  The graphics are lovely, the music is 10 out of 10, and it is enjoyable to play.  My thumbs-down is not me panning the game, I'm taking the ""Do you recommend this game?"" question literally and writing my review as a warning.  There comes a point when games are so excessively difficult that people need to be notified going in.  There's a very high chance that most people should avoid this game, because this game is designed to appeal to an extremely small audience: the highest tier of elite, hardcore, massively-skilled gamers.If you want an idea of what you're getting into, imagine one of the hardest games you've ever played, and then imagine if that game sent you back to the very beginning after the slightest mistake.  A bird in Ninja Gaiden knocks you into a pit? Back to level one.  Get hit by a single stray bullet in Contra?  Back to the title screen.  This game is about as difficult as trying to beat Mega Man without getting hit once.I was aware that this game was difficult when I bought it, because I love nightmarishly difficult shooters and roguelikes, and this game still was able to alienate me.  You can have a competitive, positive attitude about challenging games, and Nuclear Throne will still transform you into a ragequitter. There is no forgiveness, and there is no room for mistakes.  Nuclear Throne demands absolute perfection of you.  And this game doesn't play fair.Your health bar is pretty much irrelevant, because there are no invincibility frames upon getting hit.  You can have tons of HP upgrades, and a small cluster of bullets will destroy you inside of a split second.  There will always be something far off screen shooting extremely high speed projectiles at you, and your view is very zoomed in.  The screen is always violently shaking, and the game actually mocks you if you turn the screen shake ""feature"" off, as though your desire to make the game less of a jittery mess is somehow your fault.  Most enemies explode when you kill them. Sometimes it doesn't damage you and sometimes it... does?  Sometimes you'll die being sucked into the exit portal because it spawned next to an explosive object.  Sometimes the game will randomly generate a level where you are surrounded on all sides by enemies with no cover, and you're dead seconds after the level loads.You will be saying ""what the hell even HIT me?"" constantly while playing this game.  Even the best played runs will end because of the tiniest mistake.I'm certain that the sense of accomplishment upon beating this game is absolute euphoria.  And I'm very certain that there are gamers with superhuman reflexes that this game is like catnip to.  I will say that if you can beat this game, you are truly a phenomenal gamer.  I wouldn't laugh at you if you printed out a screenshot of you beating it and hung it on your wall; you've earned it.  If you are one of those people that is looking for the ultimatest of ultimate challenges, then this game is going to deliver in spades.But for the rest of us mortals, I recommend saving your money and your sanity.

												This game has the most ridiculously awesome weapons I have ever seen. You start off with the standard variety of pistols, rifles and shotguns etc. and the developers did a great job of recreating the archetypal behaviour and feel of these familiar guns. The starting weapons do feel a bit underwhelming however, but with enough practice and perserverance, you begin to move deeper into the game, where you are presented with some hilariously over the top futuristic weapons that are very fun and original. For example, the super plasma cannon... Imagine the BFG from Doom, only this time the giant ball of plasma steamrolls over all the enemies, before blowing a huge chunk out of the wall, then splits into several smaller pieces, which fly in all directions and blow additional chucks out of the walls before finally exploding... I won't spoil anymore because one of the most satifying aspects of this game is simply discovering new weapons and trying them out for the first time. The combat manages to hit that same nerve as old school Nintendo games like Contra or Mega Man, but adds a variety of usable characters, which enable you to develop your own playstyle. There are several different characters to choose from, all with unique abilities, and interesting personalities. At the time of writing, I had put about 60 hours of practice into just one of them, before I finally felt like I had mastered it (literally a fish out of water that smokes cigarettes, plays guitar and dodges bullets by floundering around). My new favourite is a guy who's head is covered in eyes, is telekinetic, but is unable to speak because he doesn't have a mouth, so instead he just mumbles incoherently. He attracts enemies but repels bullets, which is highly effective, and completely changed my approach to the game.Make no mistake, this game is extremely difficult, but the learning curve is just right and rewards the player through a process of trial and error. Got shot by laser beams? Ok, I'll move out of the line of sight next time. Died to a self-destructing robot? Alright, I'll make sure to stand back when I finish those guys off. Before you know it, you're a pro, and previously difficult sections start to feel routine. That is, until you reach the final boss for the first time and the anxiety gives you a heart attack from the overload of adrenaline...I haven't had this much fun with a video game for a long time. It makes the rest of my library look sad, and lonely by comparison. If I could choose just one game to have with me on a deserted island, this would be it. Nuclear Throne is an instant classic, and to overlook this title would be doing yourself a disservice.10/10			"

								I LOVE rouge-like games, and nuclear throne gets the formula down perfectly. This is one of the very select few games that are actually worth the money early access. Most games in early access should probably be a full game before being sold, but it is a GIFT that Nuclear Throne is early access. It has a great community, easy to understand gameplay, and developers with good heads on their shoulders. If you like games such as The Binding of Isaac, this is DEFINITELY a game for you.			"

												I won't debate over what could the game have been if worked on more, with more content or whatever. I actually think that it is one of the best twinstick shooter-action rogue-like and one of the best, let's simply say, action game of all time. I'm speaking of game pleasure, enjoyement sec per sec. It's amazing how, to me at least, the game provides raw fun and addiction. I can't really explain why, is it because of its elegant simplicity but vicious difficulty ? Or the perfect feeling of power into a fragile body that can go anywhere but still die at every moment ?Or the fact that everything felt like into my control when I control nothing ? Or maybe because you fall into a repetitive mechanic of doing the same things but always different ? Hard to say, but I think that the secret of this game lies into a perfect balance of things. It's true alchemy.			"

								This game has a deep learning curve but it is increadbly satisfying when you unlock a new person or reach a new level. It is harder then it looks but you get use to it soon and the constent updates are very good allways improving somthing and changing somthing for the better. I deinitely recomend Nuclear Throne.

												The goal is to reach the end right? If that's what you've finally done, and you're proud of yourself, then you have failed. Reaching the ""end"" is not the goal. You literally just go as far as you can until you die! And if you're lucky, you might even discover a lil' bit of a secret...I highly recommend this game. It's one of, if not the, best rougelike I've ever played! It's an achievement for Vlambeer, it really is.			"

								This game just might overtake The Binding of Isaac as the best modern roguelike. Not as many items and mutations as that game but the raw gameplay is skill based and more akin to Hotline Miami as opposed to BoI where it's all about your items and bullet-hell running around. It has a wild-west feel of emptying your clip and hoping that when the dust settles you'll be alive and there'll be enough supplies for the next level.The story, setup, worlds, bosses, guns, enemies, and artstyle are top notch. Every time you die it never feels like the game screwed you, and each world has it's own tactics and style. Just a perfect game and a truly unique roguelike. My only complaint so far is that they need to add more characters. 7 doesn't feel like enough for this game.			"

								I have very little gametime as of writing this review (1 hour).The game has an amazing soundtrack, is addicting, can run on a potato, and isn't as hard as people say it is. I will say on a difficulty from 0 to 10, it is a 7 for me. Sidenote: Binding of Isaac: Rebirth or any other rogue-type games has taught people alot about dodging in this game which they are able to do without any trouble most of the time. I suggest you have some expierence in rogue games first before playing this one.PS: I turned the game shake down to 0 beacause I was getting dizzy.			"

The GoodTwelve characters to choose from, each with their own passive and active ability, loads of guns too.Each run is different, maps are generated randomly and you are offered a random set of mutations to choose from every time you level up.Great Soundtrack.Daily and weekly runs with leaderboards.Endless, go as far as you can without dying.Fast paced. The BadLocked to 30fps, such a shame.Slightly buggy, community has been waiting on a fix for almost a year now.Boss intro splash art can cause crashes, thankfully this option can be turned off.

								This game is bad to the bone. I enjoy the soundtrack and the mutations are a fun leveling tree. This game is tough. I would like to see online multiplayer. My only complaint so far has been that in local co-op the descriptions of stuff, such as your base traits and what the mutations will do, overlap and cut one player off from seeing their description properly.I have also noticed that it seems significantly easier in singleplayer than in multiplayer (though still hard as crap-for me anyway). I'm not sure if that means that me and my friend suck, if multiplayer is not ideal for this crazy fast paced small level game, or what.Regardless of any flaws, this game is awesome. I paid full price and it was totally worth it. I highly recommend it, as long as you are prepared to die a ton.			"

								First, I just wanna say ""curse you Vlambeer, why'd you have to take the standard dual stick model and make it your own?"" I'm still kinda in awe over what a great game this is. So much so, in fact, that even with the bugs, the lack of content [still being early access at time of writing], I want to play over and over. More so than some $109 games (*cough*bf4*ehem*). The famous last words ""just one more game"" are uttered quite a few times during my sessions with Nuke Throne. There is sooo much that is right with this game but the most notable is the controls. Vlambeer gets them right (everytime!). What gives this style, flare, replayability and more fun factor is nice selection of characters with diffrent and challenging abilities and an ever expanding list of items, weapons, leveling up, and upgrades. I can't say enough good things about this game so I'll sum it up for you. If you are a fan of dual (or twin) stick sh'mups, what are you reading this for? You should have already bought the game! But since you haven't you should support a good indie dev and buy it in its early access. Regardless, I've got the ""itch"" to play again, but this is a solid 10/10 in my book and maybe in top 5 dual stick shooters of all time (pending completion).->RoX<- "

								Indie game of the year 2015. Sorry Undertale, you have heart and story, but this game has raw replayability.One of the best roguelites I've ever played. You don't have to reset endlessly for a viable run, enemies actually die when you shoot them, and...just in general, it's a joy to play. It's punishing as hell, but it's fast, the gunplay is amazing (Borderlands doesn't have ♥♥♥♥ on the weapons in this game) and only the most frustrating deaths will dissuade you from taking explosive revenge.It's also worth noting that it's one of the most exemplary titles in Early Access and it won't go on sale until after release, so if you're curious, go for it now.

												This is great! An action-packed, hectic and fun-as-heck top-down shooter which is very addictive. It has a variety of characters for a variety of playstyles and a mass array of weaponry. This game is pretty difficult, definately not for the light hearted! Also, if you've not got a decent PC, don't worry! I have a pretty lame laptop, and it runs just fine on that!Another thing; it has local co-op and partial controller support! One minor complaint though, I would not reccomend using a controller, feels kinda stiff. Maybe that's just me, but anyway...This a brilliant game, seriously recommend it to all!			"

 Nuclear Throne is an art. It shows the importance of self-discovery and ability. It tells us to continue to try try again, to prove our own worth to reach our end goal.It shows to us that no person is without their own specialty, and with that you must rely on that key specialty on your survival... ...That is until online co-op hits, and everyone goes with guns blazing. First off, I have to say that these developers, are probably one of the most generous indie-developers out there.Giving free copies of the game to those who purchased it beforehand. And they did it TWICE!Not only is that incredible. But it was an extremely effective marketing strategy, as I was a lucky recipiant of this game from a friend.Now, in this current time. This game is still in development. But the community full of veterans, and newcomers alike all share a common interest. ""We all wanna' run with the godz of the gunz! Pop Pop! Using Guns with 6 Senses."" Features-12 Unique Characters with Unique abilitiesFast Paced GameplayGreat replayabilityCrisp Pixel GraphicsSatisfying AudioClean User InterfaceSecrets already tucked into the gameA Gun GodPossible Improvements-Tweak the Drop Rate of Health, as new players may find it difficult to survive early on.Tweak each character's abilities to make them even more unique. As one character can fire two weapons simultaniously, and another can fire the one gun twice on activate. It's easy to see which character looks surperior whether they are or not.Personally if possible remove the +4 Max health mutation, and add in-game drops which individually increases your health in increments. However, I can see the community being O.K. with the current choice.That's it, the game is pretty stable at its current state. Keep an eye on this game as anything can change, making the ride, that much more fun!I also expect the Online Multiplayer to be out soon, I want to experience throwing grenades to the one who gave me this game.I would recommend anyone with a happy trigger finger to hit that damn purchase button.Actually, don't do that. Buy 2 Copies and give one to your friend! If you don't have friends. Give it to someone who wants it, and form a new friendship. The possibilities are endless!  "

								Nuclear Throne is a ""roguelike-like"" where you play as (currently at the time of writing) 11 mutants. All with different abilities to gain access to the Nuclear Throne. These abilities can vary from an ability to spawn mutants from your bag and having the ability to trap a creature to the floor with vines. It's probably the most-difficutly-entertaining games I've probably ever played. There's a handful (for what I know right now) of secrets that are the funniest secrets in a game I've seen. Mostly by how you get to these secrets. No spoilers here.It has a crisp visual style which brings the game to life exactly how the sound brings the games to life. Every mutant sounds and looks heavily different; making each character unique to their abilities. The mutants you play as, are at the start, mostly locked. You have to progress through the game to unlock them. However, at this time, for me personally, all of them are easily unlocked.With this combined, it has really high replayability with an awesome price.Oh, and also: From the time of writing this, it's in early access.Go and buy it, now.

								Within an hour, Nuclear Throne became my all time favorite game. Having over 200 games on Steam and having played many more on handhelds, consoles, and yes, even phones, I can safely say that this game is worth thirty times what it costs as of now.Let's start with the gameplay. Oh, the gameplay. Every gun is varied and somewhat useful and satisfying to use, the characters and how you play them vary vastly despite having little differences between them, And by satisfying, I mean oh, good lord. Let me quantify this. Have you ever played a game in which a shotgun feels the same as a pistol? That game lacks what some call, ""crunch"". Nuclear Throne is naught but crunchy. Killing with the basic revolver is satisfying if a bit difficult, most of your friends will find differing opinions on characters to use, and finally, the game's FUN. No questions asked, straight-up FUN.Now how about the graphics and sound? This game has one of, if not THE best pixel aesthetic I've seen. Everything pops out from the background and it feels alive. It's not muddled down by the browns and the greys; you can tell what's what almost all of the time. Oh, and the music is spectacular. It's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time and every song or ambient track is somewhat enjoyable.How about the length? Well, depending on your skill level, it could take you over 500 hours to even make it to the final boss once. However, if you're skilled enough, you could loop twice within 40 hours. It really does vary on skill level, so I wouldn't say much about it. Just know that no matter how many times you try, you'll come back to the game.In essence, this game is fantastic beyond belief. Vlambeer is a fantastic developer that I would very much enjoy to purchase from in the future. They've released several other games that I'd recommend as well, too, so check them out if you can!...except for Super Crate Box. That one was just frustrating.			"

								About as difficult as some of the tougher NES games. I still haven't beaten the game yet after 13hrs of trying to reach the Nuclear Throne, the last level is insane. If you don't have enough ammo or the right mutation you are screwed. I've gotten to the last level maybe 20x but on my last playthrough I only had a few more enemies to kill when a big green blob sat on my face. RUFKINKIDDIGNME!! I have 13hrs logged on a 15 minute game. I thought I was good at games, this game thinks otherwise. 3/22/15 - The day after I posted my review there were some balance changes and I was finally able to reach the Nuclear Throne. I like how impossible this was as it reminded me of old NES games but I think the balance changes were necessary. If you want to ramp up the difficulty you can add modifiers to your game by going through portals or play weaker characters.3/28/15 - The Throne is dead, long live the Nuclear Throne			"

								There is that thing you get in a few games, that visceral feedback, that sense of truly having an impact on things around you. First time I can remember that feeling was in Dark Messiah, after kicking my first orc. Very few games really get that. Vlambeer, whatever their secret sauce is, GETS it.Now add the short time it takes to play a game, the multiple characters (even though I only ever play a few), the vast arsenal (far better than Borderlands : each weapon actually changes the way you play the game) and you've got something that would have been the bane of many a family back in the arcade days. The graphics are mostly meh, although imbued with a certain charm, without a doubt.It's also got that proper ""what if I try _that_ combo of powers/weapons"" that good roguelike have. But on acid. That ""let me just try one more time"" addiction that will turn a minutes long game into dozens of hours of gameplay...Just look at my record! And I haven't even beaten the game, yet!And I don't mind, I'm having too much fun anyway!Now, let me just get one more game...			"

								Killed a boss with no sweat, but was eaten alive by a magot. 10/10Really though, this game is an absolute blast. In a very short period of time this game has become one of my favorite games of all time. The fluid nature of the game will keep you guessing and playing for hours, without you realizing that any time has passed at all. The controls are intuitive and feel so good. I love this game a lot, just because the concept is great, and the execution was masterful. The game is simple enough so that you know what's being thrown at you, but clever enough to not be predictable. The soundtrack and atmosphere have me falling in love with a wasteland. My thoughts are kind of incoherent, due to the fact my brain is screaming ""Stop writting this review right now and get back to playing the game.""Basically, this isn't bullet hell, its bullet heaven.

												Please stay away from this game. It will take over your life. I've sunk 67 hours into this thing and I've only now looped it ONCE. It's really ♥♥♥♥ing hard, and it will completely win you over with its superb soundtrack, INCREDIBLE sound design, colourful cast of characters and that signature Vlambeer screenshake. The guns have an incredibly satisfying punch to them, you'll never get tired of shooting them. And you'll be doing a whole lot of shooting. If you enjoy dying over and over and over and shooting a whole lot of guns, then maybe the game is for you! You'll die a lot though! Dying means restarting the whole thing! But I mean if you have the patience for dying and restarting, there's a whole lot to do in the game. Like incredible amounts of things to discover and unlock. Fun things! Cool things! Very silly things! Secret endings! Daily and weekly challenges! Leaderboards!And a lot of dying!Don't say I didn't warn you!Great game, would die again 9/10			"

												Judging my my 280 hours of play time, I think you can tell how much I like Nuclear Throne.Out of the hundreds of games I've played in my life, few have the same level of polish and fun that this game has.Everything on offer here is amazing, the character designs are colorful and creative, the guns are diverse and all of them are useful in some way (minus the flamethrower, that gun is completely worthless.) and the gunplay is above and beyond anything I could have expected, it's so good that you can dodge hundreds of fast projectiles while gunning down dozens of enemies if your skilled enough, and most deaths feel like they're your fault. Movement is spectacular, I never feel like I'm too clunky or too fast. Characters offer surprisingly diverse playstyles, each one has a unique personality and feel. The music, while not anything I would listen too outside of the game, is still serviceable, and fits right into the post-apocalyptic universe. This honestly applies to just me and possibly a few others, but the ability to, ""Loop"" makes this game for me. Being able to never really beat the game is great, and I always manage to make it a little farther each time I play, which elevates replay value through the roof.My only problems with this game has to be with how squishy your character is, and while not a problem at all in the normal game, by Loop 2 it boils down to dumb luck as to whether or not you get hit by one of the one hit kill enemies, or whether or not you run into a bad spawn. The insta-kill enemies in loop really make some deaths not your fault, since you can spawn right on yop of them from time to time. The 30fps frame lock is annoying, but the engine that Vlambeer used doesnt't allow 60fps anyway, so I can't really complain.Overall, an amazing game, provided me with over 200 hours of fun. Worthy of it's 12 dollar price tag, I don't think you need to wait for a sale.			"

The controls are perfectly tight. The soundtrack is brilliant all the way through. The devs are enthusiastic about their work and it shows in terms of the game's level of detail, weekly updates, and their engagement with the community.It's not even complete and it's already one of my favorite games ever.

								Extremely fast-paced shooter where you have to keep track of everything going on and brace yourself for bullet hell.You play as one of 10 characters (more are being added), all with different abilities. The range of abilities paired with the different weapons and player mutations enables you to try many different playstyles until you find one that suits you.Some of the characters have melee weapons other have ranged weapons, all with different properties.Most of the gameplay is running around quickly in a small arena trying to kill all the enemies in order to get power-ups, ammunition & new weapons. Between the randomly generated levels your character gains mutations which are different perks applied to your character.			"

Very challenging game with most deaths can happen before you realize what is going on but a single run shouldn't take more than an hour. Developers are constantly updating the game which is great and despite being in early access, the foundation is really good.The only problems are that the game doesn't have that progression or replayability of another action/rogue-like game: The Binding of Issac. Despite procedurally generated levels, there isn't enough difference between runs to make them stand out in terms of new enemies, situations etc. But what's in the game so far is good and it can only get better from here.

												You know that game you saw at the arcade that had all of those flashy lights and drew you in the second you saw it?  Remember how you then went up to it and put your quarter into it, and then before you even knew it, you got a game over screen?  And then instead of walking away, you put another quarter in the game to give it figure out what even happened, only for you to just barely grasp the gameplay before you died again?  And then you dumped your entire wallet into the game and by the end of it all, the longest you lasted was 10 minutes?Nuclear Throne is that arcade game.It proclaims itself to be a roguelike, similar to Binding of Isaac.  In fact, a lot of people make comparisons between the two games, saying that they're similar.  To that I say, there's actually not very in much in common.  While they are both roguelikes and you need to get to go through a number of levels to reach the ""end"", as well as having the same movement scheme with the WASD keys, and having a variety of characters to play as, those are the only similarities they have.One of the ways Nuclear Throne makes itself very different from Binding of Isaac is by making your primary means of attack with guns and melee weapons like wrenches and sledgehammers.  You use your curser to aim, and then you click whenever you want to hit/fire from your gun.  And as with real life guns, you need to reload and get more ammo after you've shot them all into your enemies' corpses.  The ammo is relatively easy to find, whether it's in chests or from drops after you kill enemies, but it's still a good idea to not unload all of your bullets at once, because some enemy will pop up when you need your bullets the most, and you WILL die.Another thing about Nuclear Throne is that each level has no doors.  It's one solid room of different environments depending on where you are, meaning that your enemies will find out eventually if you don't hide behind some walls.  In order to progress to the next level you have to kill everyone on the current level, but levels are so small in general, it should take you not even 5 minutes to make a corpse out of everyone.And finally, this game has a very arcade-like feel to it.  A single run can be done in 15 minutes, but just like all of those arcade games you might have tried to play, you will die.  You will die A LOT.  Enemies hit with a lot of power in this game, and if you're not quick, you'll get hit rather easily and blow up within 3 seconds.  Othertimes you'll get bombarded with ten enemies on the screen at once while you're also surrounded by tons of explosives.  Or even worse, you'll kill an enemy, and it'll explode, catching you in the blast and killing you that way.  The point is, you will shot full of holes all the time.  Success is not easily come by in this game.And yet despite this, this game is extremely addicting.  The very short amount of time it takes you to get to the Nuclear Throne, along with the fast-paced action, makes it very easy to get sucked in for hours and hours.  That mentality of ""just one more try..."" will consume you.  Maybe you won't get drawn into it as much as the Binding of Isaac games due to less content, but the addiction factor is still there.With that said, I can only reccomend this game to those who aren't afraid of a challenge.  You will die a lot, as I have reiterated many times in this review.  You will die because of stupid decisions, because you didn't move fast enough, or because the game decides it hates you and has hordes of rats storm you from both ends of a narrow hallway and sink their fangs into you.  This game does not care about you winning.  I'm pretty sure some of the Steam achievements make this apparent with how one of them requires you to sit upon the throne with a certain character when they're seconds away from death.  But if you don't mind that (and are perhaps a masochist), then by all means buy the game.  Just don't go expecting this to be Binding of Isaac, because you'll be in for quite a surprise then.			"

								Nuclear throne is amazing. It is a necesity to think on your feet and react to your surroundings. Getting owned on 1-1 is going to happen. However, then you get an OP combo and you make it to the final boss where you fight until you die. It is great. :)!			"

												Bullet hell + Rogue-like = Nuclear Throne. A game that imho has been held off by the dev's decision of making it Early Acces, but that nonetheless has pushed through the hardship and become ""that-one-other-roguelike"" that knew how to push forward the genre mixing it with bullet hell and 'semi' twin-stick shooters characteristics.Innovating with PC (player character) selection with it's own secondary abilities each, and interesting mechanics as for example the somewhat of a ""survival-shooter"" one, where u have to struggle (sometimes) to get ammo, this game has known how to find his comfy niche into the rogue-like genre.TL;DR : Buy it Try it now !!

								Even though I've only played like an hour and a half so far, Nuclear Throne is a fun, fast-paced, fun shooter that goes on and on and on until you've reached, the Nuclear Throne. There are a few different characters to use, each having different perks. There's many different guns, each using ammo that you have to pick up. The game goes on to the next level after you kill all the enemies, and if you die, you restart from level 1 or pick a new character. Like I said before, it's a fast-paced, fun shooter that you'll enjoy for a while, even if it's just constant levels. (Also, beware that ESC on your keyboard exits you out of your game when at the main screen!) Plus, the game is only $13, if you're looking for a cheap, but fun game. I'd give this game an 8.8/10			"

Vlambeer, you've outdone yourselves once more.PROS:-Balls to the wall difficult-A ♥♥♥♥ ton of replay value, maybe even more than Isaac-An epic soundtrack with a mix of hard rocking songs and mellow melodies-A disgusting amount of weapons (Although, some of them suck.. -coughtoxiccrossbowcough-)-Plenty of upgrades that allow you to tailor the game to your tastes-Constant updates. with plenty of new featuresCONS:-Still in beta, which means the game isn't nearly as good as it will be-Low number of characters-Not that easy to mod, sadlyAll in all, this game is beyond good. If you like Touhou, Hotline Miami, or Isaac, you should pick this game up right away. Also, if this game goes on sale, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if you can barely afford food, YOU BUY THIS GAME.10/10 its pretty ok "

								So far excellent game overall and particularly like the gameplay  (though still trying to pass 3rd level).Reminds me a bit of Hotline Miami, but somewhat faster movement, and with the addition of health and random generated levels, which all feel just the right combination.Also, I am a fan of Vlambeer's action style, pixel graphics, sound and music, having just played Ridiculous Fishing on my iPad, where Nuclear Throne feels like a crazy continuation from shooting all those caught fishes (which itself feels ridiculously good).All in all, highly reccomended.

												So this game plays a lot like both Hotline Miami and Binding of Isaac. First off you start as a measly level 1 mutant with a revolver, a special ability, and a thirst for plutonium and more power. The levels, loot, and enemies are all randomly generated, with set bosses at certain points. Get enough plutonium and you'll level up and get to pick one of four random new mutations (more ammo capacity, more melee range, some kills generate HP, and so on). When you die, it's game over. You will die a lot, and you will keep saying to yourself ""Just one more time......"" over and over again.			"

												Kick-@$$ roguelike, tactical-shooter. Most of my playtime with Nuclear Throne has been with the Humble Store (DRM-free + Steam key) version. So my Steam stats don't reflect my experience with it.PROS:+ Arcade-like gameplay.+ RPG upgrades.+ Great sense of humor.+ Gamepad support (been using an Xbox 360 wired controller).+ Windows/Mac/Linux compatible.+ Multiplayer, up to 4 players.+ Will run on almost ANYTHING. Tested on a Lenovo ThinkPad T-61 with only an Intel 965 GPU (shared memory), runs great.CONS:- Only if you're a graphics snob.			"

								This game is so much dumb fun, and probably the best thing to come from Early Access. The characters are memorable, differing, and fun (my favorites are Crystal, Chicken, and Rogue). The game is in the most unique post-apocalyptic setting I've seen, being a grim nuclear wasteland that is also strangely cute and silly. The bosses are big and threatening. You'll want to press on even though it is a roguelike so you'll be starting over a lot. If you like roguelikes or just dumb fun, play Nuclear Throne. You won't regret it.			"

												10/10There is nothing I can say about this game that you can't already find in the countless positive reviews you'll find on this page. The gameplay is responsive and consistently engaging. I haven't even made it all the way through and I love it. The furthest I've reached is 5-3 and I died almost instantly on my first encounter with Lil Hunter. I was devastated that I died. I was overjoyed to have made it that far. I was excited to try again. And that's the best part about this game. No matter how much it kills you, no matter how frustrating it becomes, you never feel like it's impossible. It inspires you to try again and develop better skills. Now, THAT's what makes a great game. I did not reach the nuclear throne, but at least fish can roll, right?			"

												I absolutely love this one. Fast and ruthless 2D shooting action, through various post apocalyptic themed levels. Choose your mutant, carefully pick your two most favored weapons from a huge assortment of available ones, and it's kill or be killed. There is also some strategy involved, in the form of picking mutations for your character, as there won't be many chances to do that. Also, great soundtrack, very close to the game's atmosphere.Thumbs up, all the way! (..oh, and watch for exploding cars!)			"

								**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS WRITTEN 10/26/13 AND AS THIS GAME IS IN BETA IT IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING SO THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE GAME AS IT WAS AT THE TIME**Yet another addicting roguelike from Vlambeer and friends, Nuclear Throne is the cooler older brother of Super Crate Box. This time around there are more crazy monsters to kill with another massive arsenal and seven new playable characters to do it with. When I first saw previews for the game, I recognized the work immediately as Vlambeer, as I was a huge fan of Super Crate Box. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this game is being able to move freely through an open level, opposed to the single screen of SCB as well as the option to choose from multiple characters with different stats and special abilities.After a few failed attempts at trying to reach out to Vlambeer via Twitter for a possible copy to review I just decided to buy it. Supporting indie developers like Vlambeer who have provided us gamers with awesome free games like Super Crate Box doesn’t bother me, I just didn’t want to wait till my next payday to be able to play this game, AND coincidentally Nuclear Throne happened to come out on my birthday. Anyway, I digress… Nuclear Throne is more fun than playing Mario 3 christmas morning 1988 and manages to keep you on your toes while you battle through each level where your goal is to clear it of all enemies. Loaded with upgrades, tons of different weapons and ammo, a boat load of monsters that came off a zombie infected Noah’s Ark of doom, and a cast of characters resembling the Garbage Pail Kids, Nuclear Throne is sure to turn you into the next Toxic Avenger.Nuclear Throne is Vlambeers latest action roguelike-like about mutants fighting their way through a post-apocalyptic world. The radioactive waste in the world allows mutants to get ahead by mutating new limbs on the fly, the abundant availability of powerful weaponry makes the quest to become ruler of the Wasteland one fraught with peril. At this point in development, Nuclear Throne consists of 7 playable characters and has 4 worlds, each containing 3 sub levels that you must complete before moving on to the next. Your ultimate goal is to clear the map, collect ammo, build your arsenal and gather nuclear waste to gain levels.To gain levels you must collect the nuclear waste capsules that enemies drop after you kill them. After collecting so many of these you gain your next level and given the opportunity to upgrade your character. Some of these upgrades include “Lucky Shot” that when added allows some shots to regenerate ammo. “Blood Lust” gives you the ability where some kills may regenerate your HP, or “Rhino Skin” which gives you an added +4HP. These upgrades are essential to your gameplay, and if you choose wisely you can get further and further every time you play.The gameplay of Nuclear Throne is genius and compelling, keeping you glued to your computer making every last bullet a battle cry at redemption. Each character has its own special ability and varied stats, for example, “Fish” gets more ammo than most other characters, and his special ability is the doge roll. Whereas “Crystal” gets more HP, and has the crystal shield as a special ability. Right now my favorite character is “Plant.” He moves around faster, and has the ability to throw seeds out and snare enemies making it easier to kill them. This helps greatly when trying to move around enemies that are shooting at you as well, not to mention snaring larger enemies allowing for an easier target to move around.Weaponry isn’t an issue when it comes to Nuclear Throne. Everything from a screwdriver to a grenade launcher, Vlambeer certainly didn’t leave anything out of this one. The shooting dynamics when using a mouse and keyboard are flawless, and put the power from your current weapon at your finger tips. Extra ammunition is found from killing enemies and dropped randomly, usually when you’re running low. Like many roguelikes, ammo is essential and there usually isn’t that much of it readily available, especially when using the triple machine gun.You can also find ammo and extra weapons from the chests scattered throughout each level, and health is also dropped this way as well.The music in Nuclear Throne blends perfectly with gameplay and isn’t overly annoying like in most other games. I liked that each level had its own unique and distinct music that was congruent to its surroundings. Graphicly, Nuclear Throne is a step up from Super Crate Box and adds more shading while adding more characteristics to the enemies and playable characters. Overall, Nuclear Throne is an awesome game, tons of fun to play, and leaves you wanting more. Anytime that I find myself thinking about a video game outside of my house I know that its a hit. Needless to say this game is incredible, and even in early development shows promise. I highly suggest this one, its bound to be another classic.Graphics: 7/10Playability: 7/10Story: 3/10Challenge: 7/10Replay Value: 7/10			"

								What is Nuclear Throne?------------------------------------A hectic bullet-hell battle to reach the fabled ""Nuclear Throne."" Fight through levels of deadly enemies that can and will kill you on sight. Shoot maggots with a Triple Machine-gun or use a crossbow on a bandit while avoiding hundreds of bullets that will chunk your health down pretty quickly.The cast of characters is vast and their abilities add a new type of playstyle everytime you try them out. Playing ""Melting"" lets you explode every corpse you create, but you only get 2 health. That's basically a one-hit wonder. Play as ""Crystal"" and block and reflect every shot for a limited time, but be careful not to get surrounded. Play as ""Steroids"" and get a hefty amount of health and dual-weilding capacity. Ever wanted to shoot double laser guns? I know I have.This game will keep you entertained and hitting R to quick restart for a good amount of time every session. The levels are randomly generated, and so are the enemies, but the difficulty never goes down. Gather experience to gain upgrades such as an increase in melee range or regenerating bullets on hit.If you manage to reach the Vault, you can gain a Crown upgrade that may make the game more rewarding, but also challenging. You could also choose no crown, for a bald head is the best head.Whether you're a casual gamer or a bullet hell lover, this game will manage to keep you entertained for it's value, not to mention Vlambeer likes to release constant updates fixing bugs and adding content.Testimonies-----------------""Pls good, such buy, wow."" - Me""This game...is a game."" - Me""Dude, shut up, these aren't testimonies."" - Some guy""He payed me to write this."" - Anonymous tip			"

								Hello!  I have only clocked in about 5.1 hours of this game and so far, I'm really impressed. It's a great game that doesn't get all the recognition it deserves. It's a fast paced shooter that can put a player on the edged of his/her seat.Anyhow here's my Pros/Cons                                                               Pros:                                                                      Players can easily adapt to game changes.

rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 8/10 - very good similar games: Doom, Binding of Isaactags: shooter, rogue-lite, top downNuclear Throne is one of those games which have great core gameplay, but lack content and maybe a bit polish too. Because of that the game didn't provide a satisfying experience to me although the gunplay is really satisfying. What I basicly expect from every rogue-lite game these days is the following: lots and lots of unlockables -> encourages multiple playthroughs and makes death not feel meaninglessThe only unlocks in Nuclear Throne are new characters, but those I would normally count as a bonus, since they don't affect your next playthrough at all, they just offer a new playstyle, but if you don't like most of the characters then these unlocks are worthless to you. And that was the case a bit for me in Nuclear Throne. Some of the characters are useless if you ask me, but the most fun to play character was definitly Steroids, and I just play as him. He has the highest DPS and is just the most crazy character which makes him by far the most fun to play for me. But at least the character design is really creative and cool. You can also unlock crowns but they are useless and don't have a big impact on the game, and you can unlock golden weapons which replace your starting weapon, which isn't a big deal, because you get new and good weapons really fast anyway.lots of different upgrades -> makes every run feel more uniqueThere are only a handful of upgrades (mutations are they called) in this game and a third of those are completely useless. Because of that your character build will be same more of less for every run. Also there is a mutation which heals you when you make kills, this is BY FAR the best mutation in the game and has a too big impact on the game. This wouldn't be a problem if the HP drops weren't so random. In some runs the game is generous and gives you lots of HP drops, in other runs you will rarely see one. What is the point in this extreme randomness?randomly generated levels need things which are worth randomly generating -> make every run feel more uniqueWhat I mean by this is how similar the runs feel because of how the levels are generated. The enemies you encounter for every region will be the same, the types of weapons you will find will be same, just the paths you have to go will be a bit different but the difference won't have any impact on how you will play the levels, they are just different so the game isn't completely the same every time. But this is not enough. In very few instances sometimes a rare enemy appeared in a level. This game needs more of that, don't have a set ensemble of enemy types per region and use them all, but have a big pool of enemies per region and only use a few of that pool, so you will encounter different enemies every run. The weapon drops could also use more variety. Maybe give weapons status effects like burn of freeze damage (that exists in the game but just a bit).the game needs to become harder after every playthrough -> encourage multiple playthroughs and allows the developers to better balance the learning and difficulty curveWhat I mean by this is how Binding of Isaac does things. For your first run there are only like 6 regions, when you beat the final boss you permanently unlock a new region after the final one for your next run which is more difficult. Then you unlock another region maybe, but then after beating the main boss 10 times the whole game gets more difficult, but that also makes sense because by this point you have unlocked tons of items and upgrades. Nuclear Throne has the ""looping"" mechanic and hard mode, but that's it.Another thing which is extremely infuriating in this game is how sometimes you can be nothing but unlucky and just die, especially in 5-3 where you sometimes spawn in the middle of million enemies while a boss appears which shoots 100 projectiles, flys all over the places while making explosions when landing, spawning more enemies AND when you beat him he will randomly fly in a direction and explode. You beat the boss but because RNG decided to make him fly in your direction and explode you loose anyway. There are lots of really cheap deaths like that in the game. Even more infuriating is when a portal spawns near a car and make the car explode which can kill you even if you have lots of HP. And the thing is I don't understand why this is, because apart from these cheap things the enemy design is GREAT with a lot of variety and depth.One last thing. The game's core gameplay is already really good and has depth, but it could have even more depth by allowing the player to carry more than 2 weapons. I think it would be great if you just could carry a weapon of each weapon type at the same time. This is would give the game more depth because then you would have to consider more criteria when making more decisions. Obviously enemy design and balance and other things have to be adjusted as well for this to work. Just think Doom and Serious Sam.The game still gets a REALLY good score from me, because the core gameplay is just really good, great character design, great enemy design, great weapon design, great sound design and great soundtrack. All the ingredients for a 10/10 game are there, but there is just not enough AT ALL around that. The game ""Downwell"" has the same problem, but that game costs 3€.Oh, also: 30 fps lock is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid especially for this type of game.			"

												Whenever I look at reviews for games, I always look at how long the individual has played before I read the review.  I wish Steam had an option to sort negative and positive reviews by playtime.  Some people are quick to judge negatively or positively before seeing what a game really has to offer.  Have you ever met someone that you liked initially, but upon getting to know further didn't like so much?  People that have spent more time on a game are better suited to fairly judge it.Nuclear Throne isn't quite like any game I've played before.  It's a stage based twin-stick shooter with high levels of randomization.  You play as one of many mutants trying to make it to the Nuclear Throne.  Why?  It's never really stated.  The game doesn't have an in game story line.  You can go out on the web and search for information that the developers commented about if you like, but in game there isn't very much to go on at all.  Ultimately this doesn't matter much, as most people probably aren't playing this sort of game for the story.As you play through each stage and make your way to the Nuclear Throne you gain experience, level up, and find weapons.  Every time you level up, you select a mutation (upgrade) from a random list up until the final level where you get to select an ultra mutation which is unique to the mutant you are using.  Each mutant has a special ability and the vast majority of them are useful in one way or another.  You can eventually unlock different/slightly enhanced starting weapons for the mutants. It is also possible to unlock crowns for each character, each crown makes various gameplay changes.  It's a neat idea, but unfortunately many of the crowns are outright bad to the point of being detrimental.The individual stages are very short, and randomly generated.  This is both positive and negative respectively.  The short stages enable very fast games.  You can reach the throne in less than 10 minutes if you are going at a good pace.  The randomly generated stages give the game a high level of replayability but also end up being its greatest flaw. Games with randomly generated levels often do so by having a large number of premade segments and attaching a handful of them together to create the level.  This doesn't seem to be the case in Nuclear Throne, and the end result is inconsistent stages with almost no level design.  You can start a stage in a great location, and the next run you could start the same stage in a completely awful location.  After playing for a while you will have an idea of which stages are particularly egregious offenders of this and be mentally prepared for what might await, but in the end it may or may not work out depending on what you encounter.  One other issue with the stages is that they feature a very low number of unique enemies.  The three ice levels, for example, have four enemies: tanks, snowbots, robot wolves, and snow bandits.  This might not sound bad but the game crams so many of the same enemy on the screen that it evokes thoughts of an mspaint picture where a five year old learned how to use copy and paste for the first time.  The aforementioned issues become especially apparent when you loop the game.  I'll give fair warning here and say that I don't like looping as a feature in games, and I know it's something many players appreciate. When you loop everything hits the fan, and it's ugly.  The game abandons the modicum of level design that was present and flings stages absolutely filled with enemies at you.  This pours the coolness of weapon variety and mutation selection down the drain.  The farther you go, you'll discover that some mutations are extremely important, and that a small number of weapons are actually viable so late in the game.The graphics are mostly unimpressive. I wouldn't describe them as good or bad, but I will say that I didn't find them to be very pretty.  I did think that the fact that characters don't turn to face the direction they're moving in was an odd choice.  The soundtrack is great and each song fits its stage well.  The music choices in the sewer, palace, and throne room were notably good.Nuclear Throne has many flaws, but it is also a lot of fun at times.  The action is fast paced and the runs can be short enough that people without a lot of free time to spend playing can have a quick run between other activities.  For anyone on the fence about buying this game, I suggest you search Google for Wasteland Kings.  It is the original prototype for Nuclear Throne and similar enough that it should give you an idea of whether or not the game is for you.  One warning though: I don't believe Wasteland Kings has gamepad support and the full release of Nuclear Throne does, so don't let that affect your opinion.  I feel that with a handful of changes and a small amount of polish this game could be something truly remarkable, but as it is I cannot recommend it at the current price of $11.99.			"

												I tend to repel against indie titles because most have pixelated graphics, a style I never quite enjoyed looking at. So after I finally lowered my biased opinion for once I saw a game called nuclear throne. Intrigued by it's similar gameplay like ""The binding of isaac"" which I enjoyed quite a bit, I bought the game after countless hesitations and started it up the moment it was done downloading.Man was this a breath of fresh air. This game to me was like Jesus freaking christ showing up to christian people. I never thought I would say ""This is harder than trying to sing the russian national anthem backwards without even having heard it nor the russian language once"" but here I am. If you're a fan of any rouge-like games whatsoever, then this game will certainly fulfill your dreams and beyond.   The gameplay is fast, hard it will probably end pretty quick (Like me in bed) because you died but you will want to start over again because it's so addictive.  The enemies will tear you apart, Your weapons will most likely screw you over in one way or another and if that's not enough the bosses will surely leave a scar on your back saying ""i was here you lil shet.""The music is bloody brilliant and fills you with adrenaline, actually helping you getting through the harsh level. Even there is little to no story to be discovered in the game there are bits and pieces which the player can make his/her/it's own conclusion to what the story is about.I think this game is great. Actually no, scratch that. I think this game sets the bar for how a difficult but fair game should be. Not a complete pounding session but a pounding session with some lube. And maybe some baby powder.Also fish can roll. "

												Doing well in this game is almost entirely reliant upon the skill of the player, yet it still retains all of your typical, immensely satisfying roguelike elements (randomly generated levels, item drops, etc etc) and is remarkably challenging even if the game feeds you the best possible mutations and weapons you could want.Extremely satisfying overall, but it does take a reasonable investment of time to get good enough to actually finish the game, let alone tackle anything past that.8/10, would recommend.Fish can roll			"

It features easy-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay that works really well and it is a really addictive ""one more round"" kind of game. The soundtrack is amazing as well.

												Jesus ♥♥♥♥ where to begin...Nuclear throne is one of those games where you WILL have a love/hate relationship.Love it for its characters, setting, fantastic soundtrack, bosses and butt-ton of weapons,and hate it for its brutal difficulty and the occasional area where good runs go to die (im looking at you crystal caves).So, lets get into it shall we?Nuclear throne is a roguelike shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with mutants, freaks and everything inbetween. You play as a rhag-tag band of mutants, all filled with character and personality. These mutants dream of placing their mutant butts on the nuclear throne, a myth thats believed by these guys. These mutants are special, because as soon as they die, they get teleported back by these mystical portals popping up across the wasteland.The story is simple, you choose a mutant, and you travel across the many lands filled with a variety of freaks, bandits and  floating ♥♥♥♥ing crystals. In every main area (Badlands, scrapyard Etc) you'll encounter a boss that you must slay in order to go to the sub areas (Not the official name, but something I call them). These are areas that are inbetween the ordinary, 3 level areas. These are 1 level areas that are completely different in setting to other areas and hold special enemies and loot.After doing all of this (Trust me, its a long task) and doing specific things related to things I cant say due to spoilers, you can loop. This means going aaaaaall the way back to the start, but this time its harder, much, much harder. The enemies are tougher and theres a whole new cast of bosses to slay, each one harder than the last. The loot is better, but the risk is bigger.The way collectibles go, there are B-skins for every playable mutant, unlockable by doing specific things, some hard, some are very easy. There are also crowns to unlock through playing, this is essentially run modifiers that you can aquire mid way through the run or at the beginning. They add an extra challenge for the seasoned veteran. There are also golden guns that replace some of the original guns. These special versions are found in a certain area(s) and increase certain stats of the weapon or doing specific things. Also, it shines ingame and can replace the starting pistol if you finish the area its found in.The soundtrack is one of the best ive heard ever. And ive played quite a few games in my time. Each boss has its own song to go in the backround and each area has its own song too. Its so good that I listen to the songs in my spare time.So, to break it down, heres a simpler form of what I just said for the challenged reader:Pros:Fantastic sountrackVibrant characters (That talk in their own made up language)Simple yet enjoyable storyinteresting lore (read that ♥♥♥♥, its brilliant)colourful and marvelously designed areasbeautiful character and enemy designA lot of variety in enemy types and looksBosses are amazing yet challenging if not preparedBrutally hard- Keeps you on your toes at all times, even if you are just fighting a few banditsArtwork is brilliantDevs that listen to the community and are gamers themselvesCons:Some areas are more unbalanced than others (Crystal caves again...)Bugs are uncommon, but come in small sizesOften times you wonder ""What the hell just killed me""Thank you for reading, this game is my favorite roguelike, and I love it, even though my hours say otherwise.Would I reccommend this game? Without a doubt. Are there things that could be improved? Of course, but every game is like that. Its 8.99 for endless fun, anger and stupidity with the amount of loot, weapons and collectables to be collected.Thank you again for reading. "

Complete with an authentic old- school graphics style and tough but fair difficulty curve, it is pretty much the ultimate modern- day arcade shooter. Unlike the low- res games of yore, however, Nuclear Throne has randomly generated levels, randomly dropping weapons and randomly selected skills to enjoy along your journey. This is a game of skill, strategy, and white- knuckle reflexes. And pain. Lots and lots of pain.Vlambeer, you've done it again.			"

												Nuclear Throne is a beautifully made rogue-like top down shooter. It looks visually astounding, doing alot with the pixel art style, and the fast-paced action keeps you going for more. There is a wide variety of weapons ranging from conventional firearms such as machine guns and shotguns to more outrageous guns that shoot lightning and fire. The soundtrack sets the mood very well, and the characters are very diverse with their appearances and unique play styles.			"

												This is a tricky one. I love the game, great fun. A nice colletion of characters, abillities and weapons. BUT it has not been patched/upgraded in over 10 months. A change that is particularly shocking after having been patched and updated every week for more than two 2 years. The update was anounced 10 months ago but.... nothing. The worst part is that thier are game breaking bugs still in place. Bugs that existed when the game was first in early access. Check it out, but be aware and steer clear if the above bother you. A tentative yes.			"

I still haven't beaten this game and  at the time of this review I've played it for 41 hours. I don't even have all the characters unlocked.This game still has a lot of RNG but that won't always detremin how good your run will be. You can have the best weapons in the game and still die in the first zone because you also need to be good enough at the game to even finish it.You can have a great run but because you made one mistake it will all go to hell and you'll die.If you like roguelike game with RNG that still take a lot of skill to actually play you'll defenitly like this game. Also did I say that this game has some great music?			"

												This Game Is Great.Nuclear Throne is a Top-Down shooter and is NEVER the same each time you play it, after death and restart, you will not have the same map layout as before and it may be harder/easier depending on the run, Great characters with great abilities, but questionable B-skins. The game has a great open/start-up song that i end up waiting to end before i even begin to play because it's too good! Though, I'm not sure what the DLC changes the music to and if it's worth it, the game overall is challenging but rewarding.			"

Random weapon drops and mutations make for a difficult, and frustrating experience.  Feels like how survival in a nuclear apocalypse might actually be: somewhat unfair.  Sure feels good when you manage to survive a while.  Few games are like this, and i love it.			"

Especially since I play Melting. Melting has 2 HP to start off with but his right click is outstanding. You can explode corpses with it and the corpses emit an explosion that damages enemies. This is EXTREMELY useful when you loop the game and is definitely the best ability late game.Play this game, you won't regret it.			"

								Alright if I can say one thing about this game, it's that it is the love child child or rogue legacy and darksouls. Cause lets face it, no matter how far you get. ♥♥♥♥♥ YOU GONNA DIE! Normally with a game this punishing though you wouldn't want to get it, but when ever you die it's normally your fault. Aside from the unsafe spawns, (#safespawns) or the ocasional twenty snipers on a boss fight. This game will never be nuclear waste on your plate if you give it a shot, and as for my personal favorite part. My daily character is Y.V, Horror, and melting. So as a final note if you want your ♥♥♥ handed to you on a radiated plater, then pick this game up and just have a good time my friend.			"

												I tend to repel against indie titles because most have pixelated graphics, a style I never quite enjoyed looking at. So after I finally lowered my biased opinion for once I saw a game called nuclear throne. Intrigued by it's similar gameplay like ""The binding of isaac"" which I enjoyed quite a bit, I bought the game after countless hesitations and started it up the moment it was done downloading.Man was this a breath of fresh air. This game to me was like Jesus freaking christ showing up to christian people. I never thought I would say ""This is harder than trying to sing the russian national anthem backwards without even having heard it nor the russian language once"" but here I am. If you're a fan of any rouge-like games whatsoever, then this game will certainly fulfill your dreams and beyond.   The gameplay is fast, hard it will probably end pretty quick (Like me in bed) because you died but you will want to start over again because it's so addictive.  The enemies will tear you apart, Your weapons will most likely screw you over in one way or another and if that's not enough the bosses will surely leave a scar on your back saying ""i was here you lil shet.""The music is bloody brilliant and fills you with adrenaline, actually helping you getting through the harsh level. Even there is little to no story to be discovered in the game there are bits and pieces which the player can make his/her/it's own conclusion to what the story is about.I think this game is great. Actually no, scratch that. I think this game sets the bar for how a difficult but fair game should be. Not a complete pounding session but a pounding session with some lube. And maybe some baby powder.Also fish can roll. "

												The gameplay was pretty well done, I'll give this game that. However, each run makes you go fight the same enemies over, and over, and over again, making each run feels repetitive over time.Yeah, the fun in Roguelike is repeating the runs, but it's not fun if I have to fight the same thing again. I mean, if we have to go through the same level again, at least make it so the game progress is saved, like in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Or if you insist to have the players start from the very beginning, make it so each run go through a different area with different enemies. At least have a randomized boss or something.			"

												This is the kind of rougelike I've been waiting for for a LONG time. And it's pretty ♥♥♥♥in' good.It's a fast-paced, skill-based shmup rougelike where you shoot enemies and collect items in randomly generated levels.  You're challenged to dodge projectiles, mind your ammo, use special abilities and strategically choose from a wide array of weapons and upgrades for the most optimal runs. Like most rougelikes, it's brutally hard, but what I think separates this rougelike from most of the others is its attention to balance and its surprising level of fairness. Most if not all items and characters the game offers are great for their own reasons, but more importantly, bad situations can always be turned around if you think fast; nearly every death I've ever had occurred because I was careless, didn't watch my back, or I miscalculated while dodging hellfire. There are virtually no instant kills in this game, and cheap shots just don't exist. That being said, you can expect your HP to get whittled down very quickly if you're not careful, so don't get cocky!The unlockable characters cover every character archetype under the sun (speedster, tank, glass cannon, crowd control, dual wielder, berserker, etc.), and they all play quite differently thanks to having dramatically different special abilities... the farther you get into the game, the more compelling each unlockable gets. Coupled with the weapons and upgrades (called ""mutations"") upon levelling up, this allows for a multitude of different ways to experience the game. The levels themselves are also quite varied and full of secrets.And if you want to do something a little less random, the game offers Daily and Weekly seed challenges. The Daily seed locks the map generation and mutations, and you're challenged to play through it once to achieve a high score on daily leaderboards. Weekly seeds are available Friday through Sunday and can be played through multiple times, but you're locked into a character, a special weapon and one of twelve game-modifying ""crowns"".Aesthetically and soundwise, the game is oozing with style. Environments and characters are vibrant, cartoony, well-animated and original, taking full advantage of the pixel aesthetic. The rock-oriented soundtrack is upbeat and atmospheric, followed by background sound effects for added ambience. There's no ""dialogue"" per se, but many of the ingame characters add spice to the atmosphere through unintelligable quips and one liners spoken in an alien language.If you like a challenge, random levels, and fast paced shootemup action, get this game. Like, I wouldn't even wait for a sale, it's just good.			"

												My friend lent me this game still havent bought it cause im broke but if i could recomend this game your sure as hell I will. I have been playing since update 80ish im guessing but in that time that i have been playing it, ive gotten so attached to it that ill get home everyday and just go run after run after run. Even with all of its glitches and frezes its a quallity game and people should know about this game and how good it is.The game itself is a game that has a learning curve and is quiet difficult to get down (since there are like 10+ characters that all have different actives and passives). The thing is that most of it is down to the RNG of the game. One run you can have the best drops in the game and you loop like 3 time and you feel good about it. Then the next run comes and you die to lil' hunter cause of how bad it was.One bad thing is that every update there is at least one thing wrong with the game. The next update comes out and its fixed but something else is broke... but thats fine. It runs and you can play it thats all that matters. Honestly Nuclear Throne would be a 10/10 but that one problem that comes up gives it a solid                                                                                       9/10 get this game.

Normally with a game this punishing though you wouldn't want to get it, but when ever you die it's normally your fault. Aside from the unsafe spawns, (#safespawns) or the ocasional twenty snipers on a boss fight. This game will never be nuclear waste on your plate if you give it a shot, and as for my personal favorite part. My daily character is Y.V, Horror, and melting.

								I want to start this by saying this is a great game, even though its has its fair shares of flaws. Nuclear Throne is one of my favorate games even thouugh it doesn't show, because the hours I played it I was offline. For a game that is still in development its have countless hours of gameplay and if pretty well developed. There is a crazy amount of weapons and enemies, which are all well rounded and most have variety. It is being updated every Saturday which is nice unlike games like Rust that gets updated every seven or eight months. There are daily runs so you can challenge your freinds and people from around the world.Now to talk about the flaws in the game, there are mostly minor bugs most you wont see. The boss intro screen is pixleated, and some enemies  appear a little low rez but other wise it looks great ( l love the theme that they have designed) The biggest problem I have with the game what keeps me from finishing a run is it has a 30FPS lock, I am so used to playing games at 60 or higher that i have headaces if I play for a while. Final toughts on the game is that there is no reason you should not get this, it is very well rounded and challenging there is countless hours of gameplay and you will definaltly get you moneys woth out of it.

												My friend lent me this game still havent bought it cause im broke but if i could recomend this game your sure as hell I will. I have been playing since update 80ish im guessing but in that time that i have been playing it, ive gotten so attached to it that ill get home everyday and just go run after run after run. Even with all of its glitches and frezes its a quallity game and people should know about this game and how good it is.The game itself is a game that has a learning curve and is quiet difficult to get down (since there are like 10+ characters that all have different actives and passives). The thing is that most of it is down to the RNG of the game. One run you can have the best drops in the game and you loop like 3 time and you feel good about it. Then the next run comes and you die to lil' hunter cause of how bad it was.One bad thing is that every update there is at least one thing wrong with the game. The next update comes out and its fixed but something else is broke... but thats fine. It runs and you can play it thats all that matters. Honestly Nuclear Throne would be a 10/10 but that one problem that comes up gives it a solid                                                                                       9/10 get this game.

-----------NUCLEAR THRONE-----------Out of nowhere, I see that a bulk of my friends have this weird new game already in their library that seemed to have just been released, it has ""Overwhelmingly Postive"" reviews on Steam, and so it popped up on my radar. Did a little searchin' and saw a trailer or two, checked out some reviews/gameplay. And then during the Winter Sale recently while prices were a little different (not NT however, that remained $11.99) I was looking on the SteamGameSwap subreddit and saw someone was trading ""[Have] NUCLEAR THRONE [Want] Darkest Dungeon"", then I saw another one that said ""[H] Darkest Dungeon [W] Jotun"", which I had to trade. So thankfully, I was able to swap my extra Jotun (good game, recommend it) for their Darkest Dungeon (never sparked any interest but it seems to be liked), and so that's when I traded Darkest Dungeon for NUCLEAR f****** THRONE!!! (Cool story, ehh bros?) And boy oh boy, am I glad I made that trade! NUCLEAR THRONE, It's fun, it's replayable, exciting, has an irreverent aesthetic, simple refreshingly minimalized controls, intuitive game mechanics. It has rogue-y elements with some of the various passive traits that get chosen along the way leveling up, there is a variety of weapons and enemies, and I have yet to get even CLOSE to the actual ""Nuclear Throne"" yet! So it taunts you to keep coming back, and keep trying again. The game is casual enough for anyone to try, but (happily) difficult enough that it takes some skills and experiences and hours to truly master. It's definitely one of those: --""*In game, doing well, then something overtakes you, you die* Awww F***! Ok ok, ONE MORE GAME!! *Get a little bit further but then die on a seemingly exponentially harder level, but you have a taste for it, so you need MORE* Dammit, HOW DID I GET HIT BY THAT!, OK, ok, ONE MORE TRY, this is the one!""-- Types of Games. If you enjoyed some of the recent platformers and arcade shooters who utilize that familiar-yet-fresh visual enviornment and ambience, and to be honest I hate this term, ""throwback/retro-graphics"" of days past with games like the outstanding 'Hotline Miami', in which fellow men and women of the 16-bit Generation were able to have their cake and eat it too with the graphical nostalgia and the exceptional music that adds texture and depth to that world they created. Of course, this is different, but similar in it's own unique execution. It would be fun to see a full multiplayer mod where players can deathmatch. But even without that, this game is entirely worth the $12 bucks. tl;dr Buy the game, it's great, replayable, postapocalyptic roguelike fun, and there's even cards & achievements!                                           -+===PUN2404===+-			"

												This is a tricky one. I love the game, great fun. A nice colletion of characters, abillities and weapons. BUT it has not been patched/upgraded in over 10 months. A change that is particularly shocking after having been patched and updated every week for more than two 2 years. The update was anounced 10 months ago but.... nothing. The worst part is that thier are game breaking bugs still in place. Bugs that existed when the game was first in early access. Check it out, but be aware and steer clear if the above bother you.

								I want to start this by saying this is a great game, even though its has its fair shares of flaws. Nuclear Throne is one of my favorate games even thouugh it doesn't show, because the hours I played it I was offline. For a game that is still in development its have countless hours of gameplay and if pretty well developed. There is a crazy amount of weapons and enemies, which are all well rounded and most have variety. It is being updated every Saturday which is nice unlike games like Rust that gets updated every seven or eight months. There are daily runs so you can challenge your freinds and people from around the world.Now to talk about the flaws in the game, there are mostly minor bugs most you wont see. The boss intro screen is pixleated, and some enemies  appear a little low rez but other wise it looks great ( l love the theme that they have designed) The biggest problem I have with the game what keeps me from finishing a run is it has a 30FPS lock, I am so used to playing games at 60 or higher that i have headaces if I play for a while. Final toughts on the game is that there is no reason you should not get this, it is very well rounded and challenging there is countless hours of gameplay and you will definaltly get you moneys woth out of it.

								Fast intense arcade-like action. The gameplay focuses on shooting, bullet hell-style dodging and short-term planning.Rounds are bite-sized and you can instantly retry after dying, but you'll likely take a few minutes to build concentration.Very polished for an early access game, and gets updated frequently. With different characters, secret unlockables and lots of mutations/skills, there's already a lot of content.Nuclear Throne is fairly hard - you easily get cornered and die very quickly.Due to smooth controls the game feels mostly fair, but there's some enemies and situations you can just do very little against.

								If you are worried by the Early Access tag, you shouldn't be. The devs regularly update the game and to be frank, if they never updated the game again I wouldn't be upset. You won't know you're playing an Early Access game.The random level generation keeps the game fresh and there are a good variety of characters. Each have their own...I dont want to use the word ""powers"" but thats just what i call them. Examples include a chicken that can slow down time and a fish that can roll around. The game gets pretty intense with all the bullets flying around and its even better with a friend. I have 40.2 hrs in as of this review and its only going higher. Completely reccommended.

								This is one of a very very very small handful of games where i can play for 10 minutes and be immensely satisfied, because the pure play-by-play speed of Nuclear Throne ♥♥♥♥s you up on a vague cousin to adrenaline that only happens when you play a ludicrously over-the-top video game that pushes you to act immediately with zero sympathy for your failures. There is no good luck in Nuclear Throne, only bad luck, because a random generated map that'd be considered ""good luck"" is still a frenzied maze of bullets and action that you have to act on pure reflex to conquerAnd with more content coming out on a near-weekly basis? Hell yes I'm glad i payed full price+early access bonus to get this now.			"

								As someone who played the original Wasteland Kings, finally being able to afford this game and play through it is like a dream come true. I'm completely awed at how far this game has come, and I could not be any more pleased with what I've played.You get dropped in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland as a mutant with nothing but a revolver and a dream. And huge mobs of freaky ♥♥♥ creatures, robots, bandits, and everything else that you probably wouldn't want to encounter in a wasteland. All to get a piece of that sweet sweet throne.This game is an arcade style top down shoot 'em up, with different characters to pick from and randomized maps and guns, so no two runs are never the same. You will need to learn what works and what gets you killed faster than that assassin that you didn't see that just ran up behind you and ended your attempt. Now you know to stay on your toes. This game is unforgiving, and brutally unfair. But that's what makes it fun. There's no hand holding. It's all you.This game is being constantly updated, tweaked, and improved. It's already endless fun. Vlambeer has created one of the absolute best games on Steam. I would highly, HIGHLY, SO FREAKING HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who loves brutal, fast paced action, explosions, and that kind of motivating frustration that makes you say ""Oh yeah? I'll show you, I'll beat this game next run!""			"

												WARNING: This game can be very rage inducing. If you are expecting to find a Binding of Isaac/Enter the Gungeon be careful because this one is very different. Nuclear Throne is very fast paced and takes a good amount of reflexes. The diiferent characters, weapons and upgrades offer good variety of gameplay and a good amount of replayability. The art is great and the music also.But even when you start to get really good with the game, it will still mess you up. There are many cheap deaths in the game that will ruin a good run and will make you rage like hell. You can spawn in a bad place and have bullets coming from all sides, die from a car exploding from rebounding bullets or some enemy that will dodge your bullet in the last moment.The first few stages of the game are ok but after that the game has a huge difficulty spike. Many of the enemies you will encounter can kill you in a few hits and you will be dead before realizing.Overall, this is one of the best rogue-likes i have ever played and i highly recommend it but stay away if you get easily frustrated.

												Be prepared to read the words ""You did not reach the nuclear throne"" a lot.  Be prepared to accidently kill yourself when your disk gun shot richocets off a wall and back at you.  Be prepared for an adrenaline rush every time you face Lil' Hunter.In this game, you will die a lot.  It's bullet hell and you have 8 measly hit points.  Seems like it's not a problem right? Well, most shots in the game will take down half that and more.  There's no invincibility frames after getting hit, some enemies shoot powerful enough weapons that they will kill you in one shot.And yet you keep playing.There's a beautiful feel to the game.  The gunfire sounds are audibly pleasing, Every hit on an enemy is satisfying.  As you progress further, the game only gets more fun.  After looping, you begin to feel unstoppable, but eventually you get claimed and the struggle continues.  You always die in this game, but you die a little less frequently as you progress.Do yourself a favor and pick this gem up.  You won't regret it.One small note, the developers have stopped working on the game, so if you see any bugs, it's unlikely you'll get a fix for it for a long time.			"

								Nuclear Throne is a rougelike game where you play as one of 12 characters. Each character has their own special ability. Such as spawning in allies for the cost of health or having the ability to roll. Every time you level up, you get to choose 1 out of 4 upgrades. Once you level up to around level 5, it gets really fun. at around level 9, once you level up again, you get to choose your ultimate mutation. They are different ultimate mutations for each character so you might have to find out for yourself what each mutation does. (or look at the wiki) So it's really fun, many options for gameplay, and a lot of characters and weapons. Would I recommend it? Yeah.			"

												UPDATED 1.0 REVIEW:First let us look back to my review on August 26th 2014!---Alpha based review: Just like their previous games Vlambeer hits the nail on it's head by once again giving the player INSTANT satisfaction, on easy to LEARN, but hard to MASTER gameplay. This all nicely shown in a pixel art style that representative, fun and appealling.---New review:First off: This is one of the best Early Acces game releases, probably the best. With their mentality to really get everything out of EA they went and did it. Every Tuesday and Thursday on of the team was streaming: showing new projects in the developent, streaming the game, having fun with new ideas, testing new features, answering questions. They have truelly been an inspiration for me in the past 1.5 years I have followed them develop this game. We were able to see it from beginning to end and we got delivered what they were promised.The Good:- The game play: it's fast and fun- Instant gratification: Jump right into the action, no bla bla. (If you get the joke, well done).Lot's of characters, weapons and MUTATIONS: so many combinations to try out, you keep combining and you have to, as everything is randomly found.- Good challenge: If you're not a very skilled player, this game is still fun, you will still have a feeling of achievement after ending a run. For the high skilled: try staying alive when you are looped! More bosses, more environments, harder enemies!- Audio: The reason I bought the game. The rough sounds gives a tough feel, a super attitude to a game that oozes with action. Every gun feels better.- Price: €12,99, that's not pricey for a single/co-op game.The Bad: - Crashes: Game crashes when immediately leaving the co-op menu, after entering.- Stats: Stats do not load.The Ugly:- Some graphic bugs: Shovel looks weird, sometimes a glitch.Conclusion:I highly recommend this game, if you like top down shooters, guns blazing, rough audio, a cool soundtrack and EXPLOSIONS! So much fun and hard to get through. You'll easily get you money out of it! Thanks JW + Rami (Vlambeer) and team.			"

												Nuclear Throne is a fast paced shooter. I feel that it's a cross between a twin-stick shooter and The Binding of Isaac. It is a hard, but addicting game that rewards you the more time you spend honing your skills. Yes, some of your level spawns can ruin your run, but it's mostly player error. If you like a challenge, this game is for you. It's not Dark Souls difficult, but some days it can feel that way. I have logged many hours into the game, and yet to tire of it. I am gaining skill with each character, and what guns and mutations work best with them.			"

								I couldn't recommend this game without saying one thing. It's friggin' awesome. For a cheap title, it's a hell lotta' fun.For one, it's filled with a ton of characters with various risks vs. rewards and ultimately takes a ton of skill, time, and effort to find your best character, playstyle, and luck, of course! Go full dakka as Steroids? Or equip yourself with a melee and a weapon for some more utility? Ultimately, it comes down to preference. The art so far for this game is amazing. The music is great, rememberable, something that you wouldn't mind listening to outside of playing it. Enemy design is great, easy to follow patterns, but when the going gets tough, it gets tough.

												Everyone who loves a fast top down shooter needs this game.  America has spoken and this game is a 10/10.  It has a good story but not as complicated as the story of Hotline Miami.  Though the two are alike there are huge differences for Nuclear Throne.  For example In  Nuclear Throne you collect rads.  At the end of each level if you collected enough rads to level up you get to choose a mutation.  These help you get through the proggresivly harder levels.  There are a lot of secrets and and each is different and unique from the last.  Some secrets get you new characters or unlock new guns or skins for previous characters.  Over all this is an amazing game recommended for all, by AMERICA. It gets the AMERICAN review of 10/10			"

												Be prepared to read the words ""You did not reach the nuclear throne"" a lot.  Be prepared to accidently kill yourself when your disk gun shot richocets off a wall and back at you.  Be prepared for an adrenaline rush every time you face Lil' Hunter.In this game, you will die a lot.  It's bullet hell and you have 8 measly hit points.  Seems like it's not a problem right? Well, most shots in the game will take down half that and more.  There's no invincibility frames after getting hit, some enemies shoot powerful enough weapons that they will kill you in one shot.And yet you keep playing.There's a beautiful feel to the game.  The gunfire sounds are audibly pleasing, Every hit on an enemy is satisfying.  As you progress further, the game only gets more fun.  After looping, you begin to feel unstoppable, but eventually you get claimed and the struggle continues.  You always die in this game, but you die a little less frequently as you progress.Do yourself a favor and pick this gem up.  You won't regret it.One small note, the developers have stopped working on the game, so if you see any bugs, it's unlikely you'll get a fix for it for a long time.			"

								Nuclear Throne is a rougelike game where you play as one of 12 characters. Each character has their own special ability. Such as spawning in allies for the cost of health or having the ability to roll. Every time you level up, you get to choose 1 out of 4 upgrades. Once you level up to around level 5, it gets really fun. at around level 9, once you level up again, you get to choose your ultimate mutation. They are different ultimate mutations for each character so you might have to find out for yourself what each mutation does. (or look at the wiki) So it's really fun, many options for gameplay, and a lot of characters and weapons. Would I recommend it? Yeah.			"

It reminds me of Hotline Miami, but with more bullets per screen and AI that doesn't turn a dime, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.I also highly recommend trying out their other games, like Super Crate Box, Luftrausers, and Gun Godz.

								Nuclear Throne is a rogue-like twin-stick shooter. You play as one of the many characters and fight to claim your rite to sit on the nuclear throne. There are a lot of weapons, and the difficulty is very high. It's very fast-paced, and extremely enjoyable. The game is constantly being developed, which is really nice. It makes it so there are fresh things almost every week. One drawback is that unlocks (and settings) are reset whenever it updates, which is almost every week. Luckily most of the characters have really easy unlocks and take 1 run to get for the most part. Even if you're one of those people who is wary of early-access games, this game is at an extremely playable state, and even if the game was considered ""finished"" at this point i would still be very happy with it. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes rogue-likes.			"

It has great music as well as brilliant gameplay and I just can not stop playing it, so well done vlambeer for making me waste all of my time.			"

								Really nice rogue-like shooter. Nuclear Throne is the successor of Wasteland Kings that was coded by Vlambeer for Mojam2. You can choose 1 out of 12 characters and try to survive. All have unique abilities. For example there is the chicken. The chicken has the chance after getting killed to run around without a head and try to get a med-kit to escape the gameover screen. Also it has the ability to go in to slowmotion.The graphics are really nice. It’s really good pixelart. I can’t complain.Go pick it up in a sale. "

Trust me, if you reach the nuclear throne, i will be impressed, becouse this game is hard, yet so addictive. its a great game and its early access, think of how great it will be when its 1.0.( I recommend melting)10/10(YOU DID NOT REACH THE NUCLEAR THRONE)			"

There is no good luck in Nuclear Throne, only bad luck, because a random generated map that'd be considered ""good luck"" is still a frenzied maze of bullets and action that you have to act on pure reflex to conquerAnd with more content coming out on a near-weekly basis?

												Nuclear Throne is an insanely difficult and sometimes straight up unfair rouge-like.I still for some odd reason find it fun and interesting despite this.Pros:➤Wide range of different characters with varying abilities.➤Quite a lot of weapons.➤Plenty of different areas with varying looks and enemies, along with secrets.➤Original & interesting boss fights.➤Very high skill ceiling.➤Crown mechanic is weird but interesting and fun to play around with.➤Lots of Mutations to obtain to keep things interesting during playthroughs.➤Local CO-OP!Cons:➤Early game is quite boring, it takes a few areas to get hectic.➤The game mostly evolves around RNG. If you don't get good weapon/enemy spawns, or get bad Mutations, you're just screwed.➤Some deaths can be unfair due to being shot by something off-screen.➤As with the Crowns mechanic, some of them are just objectively bad and have no use in a playthrough.➤Some of the AI are just a tad dumb at times, enemies will get stuck on corners and such.➤Some weapons are just useless.Verdict:I like this game. It has a lot of problems, but I still find it to be quite fun.It's rage inducing and unfair, but that's what makes Nuclear Throne so.. Nuclear Throne.			"

												Nuclear throne.. Oh where to begin with this. Lets start practicalIts a top down twitch shooter, where you play a bunch of mutated creatures that has the same goal, to Find the Nuclear Throne (TM). On the way you will encounter alot of enemies, Mutate into interresting powers, and like A Puckish rogue, Escape the police whenever possiblenow on to personal opinionsI believe Nuclear throne Stands as a perfect example for a game that started rugged and alfa, in need of support to build itself to where it stands today. the game is fast paced, Fun, whacky and all sorts of rage inducing. And I love every second I of the 84,3 hours I have played it.If you enjoy silly indie games that is Fast paced, Fun. And has alot of good replayability, This game is Just for you!			"

								Fast intense arcade-like action. The gameplay focuses on shooting, bullet hell-style dodging and short-term planning.Rounds are bite-sized and you can instantly retry after dying, but you'll likely take a few minutes to build concentration.Very polished for an early access game, and gets updated frequently. With different characters, secret unlockables and lots of mutations/skills, there's already a lot of content.Nuclear Throne is fairly hard - you easily get cornered and die very quickly.Due to smooth controls the game feels mostly fair, but there's some enemies and situations you can just do very little against.

It's already worth the price and only improves week-by-week. I'd absolutely recommend it for anyone who loves top-down rogue-like shooters with fast-paced action and a great sense of humor.			"

								This is one of the hardest games i've ever played that still is a hell of alot fun to play even if you die miserably everytime and don't even achieve ANYTHING.Although i DO recommend this game to everyone, i have to warn you. If you don't put alot of time into you won't be able to get to the Throne even once if you aren't a natural talent at it. Purchase with caution but seriously, purchase!			"

								Fantastic game.  Still working my way through it.  The best way to describe it is a topdown roguelike bullet hell game, set in a postapocalyptic world.  There are several different characters you can be, all with their own attributes.  You can hold 2 different weapons, and you can find a pretty big array of different weapons.  When you kill monsters, you gain experience and level up.  Upon level up, you are presented with 4 randomly selected enhancements to your abilities.This game is not easy up to this point... which is awesome.			"

								Incredibly entertaining, every time I die I can't wait to start over and try again. Simple, playful and challenging game that is a lot of fun in single player, but even more so in local 2 player co-op. I play it with an X360 controller and at first it seemed like the controls would be slightly off, but you get used to them quickly and soon NUCLEAR THRONE will be your favourite game to grind! The randomly generated levels, weapon drops and leveling system makes it fun to play over and over again, trying different characters, different perks and weapons. The only complaints I have is the wonky ""work in progress"" options-menu and the lack of online multiplayer, but other than that this game is a really good time, I highly recommend checking it out if you are into these types of games!

It's not quite as random as isaac in terms of hundreds of upgrades, but there's guns. Oh man, tons of mother♥♥♥♥ing guns. You can carry a shotgun grenade rifle, and a ♥♥♥♥in' auto-flame-shotgun. The devs for this game are also amazing, they've been nonstop updating this damn thing for about 2 years almost every single week. I can't imagine what the final product would be like.

								After playing the game from when it first came around on Steam, I have to say this game is just awesome. While most people are driven away by the Early Access label, being in early access is what kept me playing this game more and more. When I first got it, it was a lot of fun. With every week that came, a new update came for the game. New content, fixes, balancing, and more. This is what kept me returning to it. Every week I would check if the new update came out, to see if they added a new area, new weapon, or sometimes even a new character. Overall, this game is fast paced and tons of fun. In some areas it can become a nightmare with all the bullets, but with each new update they are balancing certains aspects of the game to keep it a bit more fair. Every time you die, you can't really blame the game. All your mistakes are just because of you, and it can take a long time to get pretty good at the game.So, yeah, pretty awesome game.			"

								Nuclear Throne is an indie rouguelike-ish game, but i would consider it a hack'n'slash game. Eventhough it's still in early access , the game seems complete, Vlambeer, the devs are updating the game every week.So, let's get right into the review!=======Story/Lore=======The story isn't the main focus of the game, it's pretty basic, but later compensated by the gameplay and graphics styleHere you have some of the story:Earth became a nuclear wasteland, after some time, humans and other organic organisms started mutating, they've grown stronger, with the hability to use guns and other stuff, the game's main objective is to reah the ""Nuclear Throne""there's not much to it :S=======Gameplay=======Well, as i pinted out on the start, it's a fast paced rouguelike game where you have a variety of characters and weapons to choose, you go trhogh stages, defeat bosses, and do loops, it's a top-down shooter.=======Music=======The music amd sound effects for this game are simply amazing, composed by JUKIO KALLIO and JOONAS TURNER really stuned me, its great music, in my opinion it's way better than som AAA games out there.=======Art/Graphics=======All Vlambeer games have the same art style, nuclear throne isn't an exeption, the animations are smooth, the game looks beautiful.=======Final Veredict=======08/10It's a game defnitly worth buying. it's extremely funny!-xoxo Kyozumo, btw, if Vlambeer is reading this, i came from Mcswift101			"

								I can safely say that many people got some sort of Binding of Issac feel from this game (in one way or another). While currently very small and limited, it looks quite promising. I just got it yesterday, it was recommended by a good friend of mine around the middle of this summer. I think it's pretty cool and edgy, I like the smoothes and diversity of the graphics even though they have a pixelated esc to them which numerous games before it have tried ""modernizing"" I should say. I have no complaints whatsoever, but maybe you guys could add more diversity to levels. I'm not asking for additional levels, but more unique styles to the levels already incorporated within the game at this point, just some flair is all. Anyways, keep up the great work, I'm looking forward to see what's gonna be brought to the table next!Make us proud devs! :D			"

								By far my favorite rogue like. Every wanted to play a game that provides a challenge with infinite replayability? (Literally it loops even after you beat the game you just never stop till you die) Plenty of fun characters each with their own unique special ability and tons of insane guns to play with.			"

Early Access Review
								Easily one of my favorite games of all times. I'm a big fan of rogue-likes but, until now, I have not really been a big fan of bullet hell games. The game is exciting from the first second, the action is fast and chaotic, and the difficulty ramps up steadily. Each run can last anywhere from a couple of minutes to 30+ minutes. It takes seconds to randomly generate a new floor so it keeps you in the action and always keeps you guessing. The entire environment is destructable so using explosive weapons, destroying certain objects, or enemies can greatly change the landscape of a floor. That along with the corpses staying on the floor, by the end of the 3-4 minute long floor, it really looks like a huge battle had just occurred. On the surface, the characters may seem pretty similar considering most of them all start with the same weapon, have the same movement speed, have the same amount of HP, and can hold the same number of weapons. Once you spend a couple of hours with a character you realize how unique they actually are and how easily you can create some pretty unique character builds by applying new mutations. Mutations are earned after reaching a new character level and can greatly enhance or modify the single run you are on. Mutations range from higher max HP and max ammo, to modifying weapons, to more utility based like allowing you to break through walls. A ton of secrets, easter eggs, and unlocks are scattered throughout the game. Bosses are challenging and fun. Mini-bosses and stronger variations of common enemies tend to spawn periodically on certain floors to keep you on your toes. There are a TON of weapons to find in random drops and random chests. Each weapon is unique and has it's own pros and cons. This makes it more interesting and there are very few instances where one gun is a hands-down upgrade over another gun because a more powerful version may have a slower fire-rate or consume a lot more ammo. Nuclear Throne is addicting, exciting, super fast-paced, and amazing fun. I currently have over 200 hours on record and don't anticipate ending that anytime soon. Highly recommended to people who enjoy shooters, bullet hells, rogue-likes, and fast-paced games in general. 10/10			"

								This game is amazing. It's rare that I ever put as much time into a game as I have with this one, and I'm not even close to considering stopping yet. The combat is rarely an issue, and every level provides a new type of challenge to overcome. 12 different characters are featured, each with their own unique passive and active, and all offering a different play style. While some mutations may be better than others, it's impossible to go wrong with mutation choices as they all offer a worthwhile upgrade. All of this combined into an endless roguelike with countless different weapons makes for an amazing experience...If you're patient. The flip side to this game is that it is BRUTALLY difficult. To master this game, unless you're one of those people who's just amazing at video games, you will need time. A lot of it. You will die hundreds, if not thousands of times to mistakes you can't believe you made. I'm approaching 200 hours in this game and I still have rage-inducing deaths on the scrapyard in daily runs.All in all, buy this game! But do so knowing that it will be frustrating and time-consuming to master.			"

								As someone who played the original Wasteland Kings, finally being able to afford this game and play through it is like a dream come true. I'm completely awed at how far this game has come, and I could not be any more pleased with what I've played.You get dropped in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland as a mutant with nothing but a revolver and a dream. And huge mobs of freaky ♥♥♥ creatures, robots, bandits, and everything else that you probably wouldn't want to encounter in a wasteland. All to get a piece of that sweet sweet throne.This game is an arcade style top down shoot 'em up, with different characters to pick from and randomized maps and guns, so no two runs are never the same. You will need to learn what works and what gets you killed faster than that assassin that you didn't see that just ran up behind you and ended your attempt. Now you know to stay on your toes. This game is unforgiving, and brutally unfair. But that's what makes it fun. There's no hand holding. It's all you.This game is being constantly updated, tweaked, and improved. It's already endless fun. Vlambeer has created one of the absolute best games on Steam. I would highly, HIGHLY, SO FREAKING HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who loves brutal, fast paced action, explosions, and that kind of motivating frustration that makes you say ""Oh yeah?

												UPDATED 1.0 REVIEW:First let us look back to my review on August 26th 2014!---Alpha based review: Just like their previous games Vlambeer hits the nail on it's head by once again giving the player INSTANT satisfaction, on easy to LEARN, but hard to MASTER gameplay. This all nicely shown in a pixel art style that representative, fun and appealling.---New review:First off: This is one of the best Early Acces game releases, probably the best. With their mentality to really get everything out of EA they went and did it. Every Tuesday and Thursday on of the team was streaming: showing new projects in the developent, streaming the game, having fun with new ideas, testing new features, answering questions. They have truelly been an inspiration for me in the past 1.5 years I have followed them develop this game. We were able to see it from beginning to end and we got delivered what they were promised.The Good:- The game play: it's fast and fun- Instant gratification: Jump right into the action, no bla bla. (If you get the joke, well done).Lot's of characters, weapons and MUTATIONS: so many combinations to try out, you keep combining and you have to, as everything is randomly found.- Good challenge: If you're not a very skilled player, this game is still fun, you will still have a feeling of achievement after ending a run. For the high skilled: try staying alive when you are looped! More bosses, more environments, harder enemies!- Audio: The reason I bought the game. The rough sounds gives a tough feel, a super attitude to a game that oozes with action. Every gun feels better.- Price: €12,99, that's not pricey for a single/co-op game.The Bad: - Crashes: Game crashes when immediately leaving the co-op menu, after entering.- Stats: Stats do not load.The Ugly:- Some graphic bugs: Shovel looks weird, sometimes a glitch.Conclusion:I highly recommend this game, if you like top down shooters, guns blazing, rough audio, a cool soundtrack and EXPLOSIONS! So much fun and hard to get through. You'll easily get you money out of it! Thanks JW + Rami (Vlambeer) and team.			"

												Nuclear Throne is a fantastic Rogue-Like top down shooter, with 12 different characters to play as, and a very huge assortment of weapons to find and choose from! I genuinely enjoy this game, it's just fantastic and absorbs you slowly from the inside out. My favorite character, Steroids, has the special ability to hold and fire two weapons which leads to very insane and fun runs. Every character has their own passives and actives such as Crystal's ability to shield and Fish can roll, leaving lots of opportunities for very fun and interesting runs. My only two complaints would be that while there is indeed co-op, it's limited to being on the same computer which isn't very fun in my opinion due to most of my friends who play NT live elsewhere. My other complaint would be the lack of modding allowed in the most recent versions of the game, which in my opinion would make the game WAY more fun and with huge amounts of variety.But despite those downfalls, it's still a fantastic game worth your rightfully earned money. Will you reach the Nuclear Throne?There is no yeti.			"

Yes, your life is hard. Still, you must try.The Throne is all that keeps you going. Can you find it? Will anyone ever find it? No one has touched it since...But what of the world that used to be? There used to be trees here. The air was once clean, waters once clear.Your gruelling journey will only ever end with the sitting upon the Throne, if the Legends prove true.

Yeah okay it's a twin stick bullet hell shooter with random level generation, blah blah. But it feels like someone loved Gauntlet, and Borderlands, and one day said WHY NOT BOTH.And indeed, why ever not?Many of your runs (especially in the first few hours) will be under five minutes. Some WELL UNDER. But as you keep hammering away it does get a bit easier. Slowly, ever so slowly.It's so good.

												I understand how it feels to have no progression but the reason that they put so many acheivements and characters at the start is because they want to give you a taste of what its like. And they put the characters there so you aren't stuck with a sertain playstyle until youre good with that specific style because they want you to explore and give you something  else to do if youcve given up on one character. But overall I think the reason that you don't feel like youre progressing is either because you haven't played long enough to give the game a chance or its because youre bad at the game(as stupid as it sounds but hear me out) and youve given up because you cant get the character you need. And I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND how that feels because its anoying and hard to deal with. But I decided not to give up and Ive know the game since update 2 and my average was dying in the sewers but now that I started again I am able to get to the palace and I have all but 2 locked characters(minus ball guy and skeleton). I think what anyone who wants to get into thise game would want to at least try theyre best to unlock characters for their style of play and roll with those characters for a decent amount of time.

												This game is amazing, when you look at all of the art and badges and cards it looks really weird, but the game itself is not only challenging and unique, but if you decide to ever delve into the pit which is the backstory and come up with your own theories, this becomes the best game in existence. I am trash at this game, it's rare I get past frozen city, and of writing this I have 45 hours in Nuclear Throne and I have only GOTTEN TO the final boss once, where I died, brutally. Nuclear Throne is a top-down randomly generated bullet-heaven, whenever you kill an enemy, your soul iscrushed if you don't snatch up their radiotion before it fades into oblivion, this makes the game very anti camping and even though you can get rocket launchers and crossbows, you never feel overpowered, miniguns will drain your ammo, and super bazookas are just as likely to kill your enemy as you. I love this game, I love vlambeer. and I wish I could draw so I could show my support even more. press B for Y.V luv			"

												One of the best games i ever played, imagine Binding of isaac with guns, Explosions and a Nuclear Apocalypse. Play it with Mouse and keyboard, with Controller it's really hard to Play.I think i needed around 50 Hours before my first Loop, and it only gets better and better,                                                               it feels absolutely awesome if you beat Big Dog, Lil Hunter or the Throne for the first Time.The game has 14 Characters, and a lot of Weapons seperated into Bullet, Shell, Energy, Explosive, Bolt and Melee Categories. You level up by Collecting Radiation, if you have enough, you are presented with a set of 4 different Mutations, with effects like ""Longer Melee range"" or ""More item Drops"".I really enjoy the Graphics, both the Character Art and the Sprites. If you want to see more gameplay,Go watch somebody on Youtube, like Sleepcycles (https://www.youtube.com/user/sleepcyclesgaming),Chubbyemu (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKOvOaJv4GK-oDqx-sj7VVg) or the current world record holder Horheristo (https://www.youtube.com/user/horheristo), i really enjoyed their gameplay Videos.Just pay those 12 Dollars, it's Definetly worth it.

												Recommend Nuclear Throne is not an easy task, you must first recognize if you have a deeper problem of compulsive masochism, if you like to suffer, this is your game.Nuclear throne is a shooter with overhead view and Roguelike elements such as randomly generated scenarios, economy inventory and high difficulty, in which we have to shoot everything that looks like a threat (a ""Shoot and then asks"" full-fledged). For this purpose we use an absurd amount of weapons (+100) which are as useful as multifarious (guitars, lasers rays, bazookas, crossbows, etc.) and a concept called ""Mutation"", which is a type of modifier which is activated when you level up your character; there are all kinds of modifiers such as increasing life points, make enemies drop more likely to make or increase shooting accuracy, to name a few.Nuclear Throne have a lot of charismatic characters with different intrinsic skills; Crystal is a piece of purple quartz whose special ability is activate a shield that bounces from enemy bullets for 2 seconds, Steroids can use dual weapons or Chicken and his ability to throw their weapons at enemies.The main virtue of Nuclear Throne lies in the constant randomness and our ability to adapt to these situations, sometimes in the less pleasant ways and perhaps an unfair randomness in some sections, but never fault the game itself but rather by the failed approach we give to our plays. Our mission is to reach and defeat the Nuclear Throne, yes, but much matter how, the weapons I have, the mutations I have chosen, the character I'm playing, the arrangement and number of enemies and obstacles on stage. Everything under the halo of a subconscious immutable fluidity and rigor that enables playing with almost no major surprises to a true bullet hell situations.Perhaps Nuclear Throne is the highest point of Vlambeer as video game developer and in which their dual philosophy of direct fun and almost obscene depth is clearly note, it is a game that can end in 5 minutes, or get stuck for hours trying to discover new weapons, situations, enemies, characters, etc.Nuclear Throne is hard drug, so beware.___________________________________________________________________________________En español:Recomendar Nuclear Throne no es tarea sencilla, primeramente hay que reconocer si tienes un profundo problema de masoquismo compulsivo, si te gusta sufrir, este es tu juego. Nuclear throne es un shooter de vista cenital con elementos Roguelike tales como escenarios generados aleatoriamente, economía de inventario  y dificultad elevada, en el cual tenemos que dispararle a todo lo que se parezca a una amenaza (Un “Dispara y después pregunta” en toda regla). Para este fin nos valemos de una cantidad absurda de armas (+100) las cuales son tan útiles como variopintas (guitarras, rayos lasers, bazookas, ballestas, etc) y de un concepto llamado “Mutacion”, el cual consiste en un tipo de modificador el cual se activa al subir de nivel a nuestro personaje; hay todo tipo de modificadores tales como aumentar los puntos de vida, Hacer que los enemigos hagan drop con mayor probabilidad o aumentar la precisión de tiro, por citar algunos.En Nuclear Throne tenemos a unos personajes carismáticos y con diferentes habilidades intrínsecas; Crystal es un pedazo de Cuarzo morado que tiene como habilidad especial activar un escudo que hace rebotar las balas enemigas por 2 segundos, Steroids que puede usar armas duales o Chicken y su capacidad de lanzar sus armas a los enemigos. La principal virtud de Nuclear Throne reside en la aleatoriedad constante y en nuestra CAPACIDAD de adaptarnos a esas situaciones, a veces de las maneras menos placenteras y quizás con una aleatoriedad injusta en algunos tramos, pero nunca por fallo del propio videojuego sino más bien por el acercamiento fallido que le damos a nuestras partidas. Nuestra misión es llegar y derrotar al Trono Nuclear, sí, pero importa mucho el cómo, las armas que llevo, las mutaciones que he elegido, el personaje con el que estoy jugando, el arreglo y cantidad de los enemigos y obstáculos en el escenario. Todo bajo el inmutable halo de una fluidez subconciente y con el rigor que posibilita una partida sin casi mayores sobresaltos a verdaderos infiernos de balas. Quizás Nuclear Throne sea el punto más alto de Vlambeer como desarrolladora de videojuegos y en el cual se nota evidentemente esa filosofía dual de diversión directa y profundidad casi obscena, es un juego que puedes acabar en 5 minutos que tengas o quedarte atrapado por horas tratando de descubrir nuevas armas, situaciones, enemigos, personajes.Nuclear Throne es droga dura, así que, cuidado.(La heroina de los Ludopatas) xD			"
