												You huddle in your boarded up apartment, surrounded by zombies.  You ran out of food a week ago.  Your last friend died three days ago.  You ran out of bullets yesterday, but you saved one for yourself.  As the zombies tear down the door to your room, you put your pistol to your head and close your eyes.You hear a familiar jingle in the distance, getting closer.  You open your eyes.  Suddenly one of the walls explodes inwards and a huge vehicle plows through, sending severed limbs and zombie entrails everywhere.  It’s an ice cream truck!  The driver has a green mohawk, and a rusty machete across her lap.  In the back you hear two people arguing about which one of them farted.  The driver throws the door open.“Get in loser.  We’re going to Canada!”			"

This game is one of the most fantastic games I have ever had the honour of playing.             I first heard of this game via YouTube, on a channel called ""PBGGameplays"". I have wanted ever since, I believe it was ~3-ish months ago, and I had been meaning to get it for a while.And then I did get it.And it was even better than I had expected it to be.             It is very replayable, due to the randomized everthing, and the sheer difficulty of it all. I have tried many times, (to seemingly no avail), to reach Caanada, but it is very difficult. Oh, that doesn't make it bad. It's not impossible; I know that, and I have gotten so close to victory once or twice before.             The controls are great too. From someone who has no usb-connected controllers, even the keyboard is great to use. The local multiplayer is fun, and it's quite easy to play using only one keyboard. I can see it working with three, maybe four players.              This game is chalk-full of quirky jokes and clever references. It jokes around quite a bit, but knows when it's time to kick some serious zomble @ss. From the awesome car prompts, (such as ""Let's boogie!"" or ""Hit it!"") which, honestly aren't necessarily even jokes, just completely awesome, to the Buttsville police departments, this game is made of the essence of fun.               I love the style of it all, and the (I think) 32-bit graphics. And the music. Ooooh the music. I love it. I love all of the music. All of it. It's the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance the zomble-filled night away. Well done.               Anyways, this game is just awesome, great job to the dev(s) who made it. If I were to rate this game with a number, it would have to be an absolute ten... out of five. I absolutely love this game,.                                                                               That is all.			"

												This game is like Oregon Trail meets Zombies Ate My Neighbors. (oh that's been said before? well, it's still true) and I think I REALLY like it.I'll get the Cons & Pros out of the way, first.CONS:it's perma-death.meaning you may get attached to awesome characters only to have him or her or EVERYONE die. :Dthe RNG on text encounters. Sometimes the RNG will seem unfair & that's just how it is with these games. Make a choice that has a 50/50 chance of being good or terrible. Oh no. Lookit, a character died 'cause the game told me she/he did.""Doors and how they can kill you"" - how doors work is only 1st player (lead role) can go through doors to go to the next room. This would be fine, BUT if 2nd player isn't immediately next to you, a delay is put in before 2nd player appears at the next doorway. In theory it's good, but it quickly becomes frustrating when you realize ""Oh no. 2nd player was 2 steps behind me and now I just killed them."" :SNEUTRALSit's so good you'll almost always get that 'just one more time' feeling when & if you die.family friendly -(could be a pro or a con) nothing inappropriate; NO cursing, excessive gore, or 'suggestive' talkPROS: (too many to list, but I'll try) 2 Player Co-Op! -drop-in/drop-out cooperative play at any time. (fun tip: 2nd Player can choose which party member to play as when dropping in on a playable encounter - ie: town, swarm event, etc.)Cool character creator -sure, it may be retro pixelated graphic style, but there are enough customization options to generally make characters that look mostly like anyone you know.64 character slots -save & use your own custom characters; can set as the 2 starting characters OR as possible recruits. different modes -3 modes are unlocked from the start. more can be unlocked as you play the game and do certain things. Each mode has different rules for which characters you will meet. (note: play familiar mode if you want your team to meet ONLY custom characters)great soundtrack (that reminds me of music from Metropolismania [PS2 game, released 2002] for some reason)Fun for the whole family & funny -in text narration, character dialogue, and some animations & referencesreferences (I won't spoil) to at least a few things from your childhood and/or 90's/early 2000s era.RNG: never knowing what characters you're going to run intoSAVE AND QUIT! - the game doesn't make this feature super obvious, BUT if you quit the game, then the current game session will be saved at the point of the last town /playable encounter. Awesome, considering each game session varies in lengthH I G H Replay Value. due to random encounters, random characters, and randomly generated levels -all varied enough to keep it interesting through dozens of hours of playthroughs (probably even more)nuances of strategy: shut doors behind you, carry up to 3 weapons, choosing roles & weapons before each playable encounter...these are all things that did NOT need to be in the game, but their inclusion gives DRtC much more strategy and depthCLOSINGI can't put into words how great this game is. You NEED IT NOW.Play it with family. Play it with friends.♠ It will make you laugh and maybe even feel nostalgic. Don't let the ""rogue-like"" label scare you off. It's well worth any frustrations. 9/10 > > > Great game. Almost perfect.-----♠ Also, play it all by yourself :( *insert joke about morale going down*... :Dedit 1 (12-01-16): fixed formatting of listsedit 2 (12-09-16): fixed typo on 'nuances of strategy' under PROSedit 3 (12-10-16): added 'family friendly' under Neutrals; added '64 character slots', '2 Player Co-Op' under Pros; reworded title and description for 'Save and Quit'e4 (12-22-16): reworded description of 'Save and Quit' to be more clear and concisee5 (12-27-16): added con ""Doors & how they can kill you"" (might even say it hit me like a ton of zombies at a doorway)e6 (02-20-17): changed wording on '64 character slots'; &added bullet point of 'different modes'			"

What is Death Road to Canada?Death Road to Canada is as the developers succinctly describe it in the Steam description, a 'randomly generated road trip simulator.' The game would also be considered to be a randomly generated zombie killing machine. The aim of the game is to lead you and acquaintances you meet along the way from Florida to Canada. This is because you have heard that Canada has been spared from the zombie apocalypse. However, as they say its the journey and not the destination that is the aim of the game.Before I BeginI have had a great time reading many of the reviews that have been contributed to Steam. This is the perfect game for sharing individual experiences. As a result, I can see fan fiction becoming an enormous part of the game's community. Therefore, kudos for this not only goes to the community members for creating this wonderful content but also to the developers for designing a game perfect and worthy of it. It is truly a testimony to the quality of the final product.Learn As You GoThe tutorial teaches you the bare minimum. For some this may be a concern but it shouldn't be. I have found that some of the best games only teach the basic mechanics needed to play. The rest is left to the player experience. If you put the time into the game you will continue to learn each time you play. This is a very good thing. This is because some of the tricks I have learned wouldn't have meant as much had they been in the tutorial and had I not learned them by myself. Some of the magic of the playing is in the learning. Therefore, the game demands that you learn more as you progress. Consequently, you may die a few times but you need to mark these down as learning experiences.Challenging...To continue with the 'learning as you go' mantra of the game it must be acknowledged that it is very challenging. For starters, the zombie AI - as stupid as zombies may seem - can be quite tough. They can swarm and they can, and will, overwhelm you. Therefore you must remain alert and vigilant at all times. You must consider if you are outnumbered and if so what your best avenue of self defense and preservation is.Weapons can and do break. You will run out of ammunition. However, you can hold multiple weapons at any one time. It is best policy to remember the strengths and weaknesses of your characters. This is most noteworthy because the weapons that you choose to wield - when you find them - can make the game easier. There's nothing better than having the ability to go to town against a swarm and defeating them all.If there is one potential weakness of the game its in the fact that the difficulty can spike unpredictably. However, there is a valid argument that this adds realism to the game. There is never going to be any scenario that is exactly as it seems. Swarms can occur at random intervals. As a result of this randomness some of these spikes can lead to frustrating deaths.... To the point of being UnforgivingGenerally, the game is unforgiving. Once you screw up there is very little chance for your survival. As a result of this the game is definitely one that has the potential to induce rage. An example of this rage came in my second unsuccessful attempt. I had successfully cleared a building and wanted to move on with the game. Therefore, I raced outside with my trio of seemingly hardened warriors into a swarm of the undead. I jumped in my car but of course I couldn't drive away because the vehicle was swarmed. They not only damaged the vehicle but proceeded to annihilate all of us. I could do nothing but watch in sheer terror.Randomly Generated AdventuringOne of the best features of the game is the way in which it is randomly generated. Stories and settings for individual segments of the game are randomly generated. However, they are based somewhat from the options you are provided with.In one of my segments I visited a city and was given the choice of whether or not I wanted to visit a sports store or a house with a HELP sign. As this was early on in the game and I was only with my initial buddy I chose to go to the HELP house. I took my chances that the house would have somebody still alive that would be willing to join my team. Although I bet the sports store probably had a nicer selection of weapons and equipment that I could pick up. This strategy was of the hope that the numbers game would help more than a randomized weapon. I was proven to be correct. I acquired the extra party member and was able to adventure on.In conclusion, the events are random. This is especially relevant considering the entirety of the game is played out within these little settings. However, it leads me to the next segment of the game that is worth noting and that is the game's buddy system.The Buddy SystemThis is one of my favorite features in the game. Hidden within the fun thrilled violence is a message about camraderie and the meaning of taking a road trip together. You have a choice at the beginning of the game whether or not you want to start with an ally. I would suggest that if you are a beginner that you do have one. If you have a second player with you then they can play the role. If not, then the computer will control them for you. Because the game has been well designed the AI does a reasonable job hacking enemies up for you.Each ally comes with their own unique characteristics and skills that can add value to your team. Although beggars can rarely be choosers you may want to consider what type of characters you align yourself with. They can stay with you until they either die or they betray you. That's right, they can betray you. That in itself is a fascinating mechanic. If they do betray you then its game over. It's best to keep their morale high - through successful completion of events and stories - although I am uncertain as to whether or not this increases the likelihood of betrayal. I assume that it would.Custom CharactersA great feature of the game is that you can create a number of custom characters. You can choose to play this character and/or have one as your buddy. If you choose not to do this then they can and will pop up throughout the game. It is at this turn that you can add them as allies.Risk/Reward and Resource ManagementThere is a risk/reward system at play in the combination of stories/events and allies. Events will pop up throughout the game that provide you with an opportunity to utilize their abilities. If they are successful then you can increase your stockpile sometimes dramatically. However, failure in any of these events can see a crucial member of your unit die. As a result you will need to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of your character, your current predicament and determine whether or not the potential reward is worth it. Given the unforgiving nature of the game each decision is significant.With that said an underappreciated part of the game is in its resource management. Players must consider how many rations, medical supplies, fuel, etc. that they have at their disposal. Players must therefore weigh up the pros and cons of adding an ally. If you are running dangerously low on resources then adding a member to your team may not be the most sage of things to do.As a result of the total combined randomness you are guaranteed a unique playthrough every time you play.

												This game is absolutely fantastic. Essentially, it is “Oregon Trail” but with zombies. The game forces you to make some very hard decisions which generally lead to table-flippingly bad outcomes. There are some other less consequential ones as well. These decisions generally are what decides if you make it to Canada or not. Shooting/Stabbing/Running skills are not what decides how good you are at the game, but some of such skills are necessary to avoid receiving too much damage. If you are looking for a survival game that is based off and challenges your finger agility, this is the wrong game for you. If you want a funny survival game that is based off and challenges your decision-making skills, this is the right game for you. 	I just beat the standard campaign and was very thrilled with the ending. To get there, you need to be very careful when evading zombies, especially at the end of the game, but this does not take too much skill. The AI's are not as good at the art of dodging and will likely die due to getting trapped. Because of this, play as your most valuable character and treat your “buddies” as zombie bait and extra lives. Food can be sometimes scarce and is very useful for trading for supplies at the end of the game, so limit the amount of group members. I like to have two people in my group, but I will add a third if he/she/(enter gender here) has good traits. 	P.S. : If you really like your “Otaku Katana” don't use it because it will likely break on the first day.r a n d o m t e x t f o r f o r m a t i n g ***   U P D A T E   *** r a n d o m t e x t f o r f o r m a t i n gI have beaten the standard game 4 times now. I have also beaten short trip to heck, rare characters mode, and friendly faces mode. I have memorized the outcomes of most events. I still hold my previous statements. Mostly. There is more to the game than just your decisions in game created senarios, your decisions on which weapons to use, when, and with   w  h  o  m   also greatly effect your chances of making it to Canada.I have also found some ""bugs"" in the game. Note: These are minor and will not effect the gameplay  t o o  much:1. You cannot kick your teammates out of the group: Sometimes trash people enter your group when you are low of food. It is irritating that there is no clear way to kill (or kick them from the group) them without risking any harm to your teammates; the only way is to send them in solo to die. (If you have other teammates present they will stick to the person you are trying to sacrifice and often die). This is very irritating to me and I would like a way to kick out members of the group, even with some possible negative results not already in the game.2. Teammates will often attempt to run through a horde rather than around it: Your team always stays close behind you (they rarely even collect loot (heckin freeloaders)). This means when you see an opening in a horde for a split second, your team will rush in behind you after the opening has closed. Conclusion: AI needs to be more autonomous3. Weird ammo glitch: I have noticed when I bring (lets say 10 shotgun ammo) with me and when I come back to the car after looting and not collecting any ammo, it will say that I collected 10 shotgun ammo. If I use 3 ammo, it will say that I collected 7 more shotgun ammo rather than the -3. This does not effect the gameplay at all but just irritates me.			"

Wow what a ride!!Death Road to Canada is a real riot. I played local co-op with my wife and we both had a lot of fun! Very humorous Oregon Trail style game blended with some hack-n-slash action, with a bit of randomness thrown in for good measure.Essentially, you are managing a group as they try to go from Florida to Canada. You manage supplies such as fuel, food, and different melee weapons and guns. There are choose-your-own-path events that pop up frequently. You sometimes will die VERY quickly from a random event, but its all good. The storyline is created as you go, and seems really great with each run.Definately one of the highlights in this game is the ability to create custom characters, and save them so they pop up on future runs. I play myself, and my wife plays her in-game self. We put our friends in there. We choose their skill sets and how they look. It really makes the 'story' aspect so much more great.Pros:+Great blend of Oregon Trail and hack-n-slash gameplay+Controller support makes this great to play from the couch+The humor is spot-on and makes for really funny storylines that definately feel very unique each time you play+The ability to create and save custom characters is awesome+RPG-esque leveling up of skills really adds a layer of strategyCons:-The music is pretty good, but is a bit 'lite' or 'wonky' for the game (this is hard to describe)-I don't know if its just us, but the controller is a bit awkward in the menus (not during gameplay, though) - it feels like it is cutting out, but it is definately not a battery thing or connection since I checked-You will have a few random deaths that feel cheap, but really its all fun and gave us good laughsDefinately an outstanding local co-op game. It is still fun single-player, but shines when playing with a friend. Overall, I could see us getting a lot of hours out of this one.			"

												My group of ragtag misfits had made it all the way to Canadian border until the party's bruiser had gotten the smart idea to throw molotovs at the approaching wall of zombies.  Shortly after this he realized his mistake as the conflagrating waves of undead set fire to not only himself but his other friends, including a luchador who spent his last breath piledriving a zombie into the hostile crowds.  As all four friends lay burning in the snow like the Earth immolating at the edge of a supernova, their last sight on this cursed world was that of a giant mech dressed as a Canadian Mountie singing, ""O' Canada""  "

												How can I summarize this game? I started out with a guy who was a friend of dogs. With his best buddy. They got into a fight and split leaving just him on the road with some dogs he picked up. Then he got sick of the road and decided to call it quits. He told the french poodle of the party to remember everything he had taught it and wished the dogs farewell.Now its just the two dogs driving to canada in an ice cream truck. My poodle become well trained and can also walk around using a pump shotty on two hind legs.10/10The game is a mix of oregon trail meets binding of isaac. I love it.EDIT:Crashes were fixed ages ago the game keeps getting updated and more improvements made by the devs. I have about 100 hours in this game and I still haven't found everything to find in it. The game offers a lot of play value for 15 bucks and frankly, so far is my game of the year.Edit 2: 11/28/2016This is still the best game of 2016 and well worth the price.Yeah the game has only gotten better and beter. The devs arep utting in a lot of love and deserve credit.			"

												- Start game with two people.- Gary has a mysterious past, and isn't good at much of anything, and is kind of a jerk.- Ishan is a martial artist, and is calm under fire. He's good at everything.- Things don't go amazing, but they're far from bad. - Eventually we come across a woman named Virgie, surrounded by empty bottles. We wake her up, and invite her onboard the S.S. Canada. She accepts.- Later we come across Jocelyn, who tells us to ""GET THE HECK AWAY FROM MY DOOR"", after we nearly burgle her house. We invite her onboard. For some reason, she accepts.- Three days pass, morale is low. Somebody needs to get kicked off the team.- I look around at my real-life friends. It's a unanimous decision.- Later, Gary.- Two days later, Ishan can't take the stress anymore, and wanders off into the bush, never to be seen again.- Later that day, Jocelyn dies when Virgie leaves her in a room full of zombies, closing the door.- The optimistic Virgie, now rid of the pessimistic Jocelyn, must find her way out of a sewer. She's cornered by zombies, and takes out an assault rifle she found somewhere. She takes down half the horde with her... but she ultimately falls.- - - - - - - New playthrough; solo, no other survivors on my team.- Come across Gary, sleeping on a picnic table.- Keep driving, because nobody likes Gary.

												I kickstarted this game an age ago on a whim, when I got fed up with waiting for Project Zomboid which it has become synonymous for.Today, I finally decide to give it a go only a few hours before launch.My surprised was welcome, as this is really fun. Like a beat-em-up crossed with Oregon Trail (or Organ Trail) the amount of replayability that is in this game is astounding.These types of proceedural generated games can live or die on their variety and this game has it in spades. I have played through only 10 games so far, all dying and have loved nearly every moment of it.There are downsides such as the graphics which on a small budget is understandable.Also the music is grating at times, with the main theme chiptune track being the worst offender.And be prepared to have this game crash often.Pros+The combat is simple but fun+The stats for characters add a nice mechanic+Has heaps of replayability+Unique characters and scenes are great+Good dev that is active on the forum and listensCons-Crashes-Very simple pixel graphics-Music is hit and miss			"

												Wow... now this is an interesting game. Basically Oregon Trails with zombies and a healthy (And heavy) dose of humor that suddenly pops up in the strangest places. Just to give you an example of this seriously hard but enjoyable game, I'll just mention my best run yet. Start off with two of my own characters, quickly recruited two more, and raided multiple places including buttville's police department. Then a rather hard siege came. I lost one; an annoying woman who was always tlaking about getting swole who bore copper goggles and a pink mohawk. But she died. Then, we went and found some traders- it was actually just a talking, standing dog selling ammunition, very casually. After him, we went and raided a collapsed Y'all mart... and we lost two of our people in a vain attempt to loot sugar cakes and cans of nodescript meat. And eventually, after crashing a car over a fissure in the ground and stealing an exterminator's van (Complete with giant plastic ant on the roof), I met Horse. Majestic, fast, valiant... and completely ♥♥♥♥ing insane. Basically, he was a completely naked man who would just neigh, wore a horse mask, and ran twice as fast as other characters. And low and behold, he would become the hero of this story. The last remaining survivor of my original group eventually diedin yet another siege, and for a long time, Horse marched on alone; charing through salvagable areas without even killing a single zombie because he could not swing a weapon. (For those are not arms, but his ""Forelegs""!) But due to some loophole the devs missed, he could shoot a gun and he became wonderous with that shotgun of his. Soon, I went and rescued a big fluffy white dog that took to Horse, and for nearly five days it was those two, riding on in several more cars (One which Horse managed to fix), having highly intelligent conversations between their barks and neighs. Eventually, the dog died in a sewer, trying to protect her equine partner. The dog and the horse- a partnership that wasn't destined to last! But Horse eventually found another companion, a bright purple haired woman with a big pistol that did much of the talking for those last few days. And then Canada, our last objective, came into view. Three sieges happened before, though... and good gods, fear those sieges. Especially when you're Horse. My purple-haired companion perished halfway into the first one (Her pistol was big, but not big enough). Horse survived the second without barely a scratch, running in circles for two hours in game time to avoid the zombies. But the final siege was twice as strong, and, two miles (I think) from his goal, Horse died as he had lived, running endlessly. This is a wonderful, brilliant game that holds plenty of surprises. It's a bit pricey, but it's worthwhile, trust me.			"

												I have a list that is mostly based on playing with a friend right in the room.Pros:-has a nice style of art, pretty good custom characters-has some pretty jammin' music-few buttons to map but enough things to keep you engaged with those few buttons, really easy to set up your controllers-has several different playing modes, and harder modes to unlock as you beat those-isn't some game that let's you skirt by being a lazy sack, you need to put a little effort to actually win-amusing little dialogue chunks throughout going to CanadaCons:-your co-op partner can be scripted to just... leave...-if one of you dies, your friend might be sitting out for awhile without playing-if you rush out of a room due to a swarm, your friend's character automatically begins to rely on a slow AI trod to that room you went to and there is a good chance they're going to die in there since the AI isn't THAT smart and they still are getting eaten by zombies on a screen you can't even seeI guess what I recommend is that maybe the game can recognise there is more than one player and maybe not make certain events where their character just bails on the story... Also maybe make it so when one player goes in another room, the other person can follow right after so they won't immediately die because they decided to slowly follow.I plan to play this game more, as it has only been a few rounds of dying horribly, but I'm trying to make this work with two people better. Maybe as we get better...			"

“ONWARD TO CANADA!”Death Road to Canada (DR2C for short) is a *perma-death* roguelike survival. Your goal: Drive from Florida to Canada in 15 days. During the trip, you will loot & manage resources, train your characters, meet new people, deal with bandits, and make decisions in many other random events.”COOL IT”Lovingly crafted in 3 years, DR2C is full of quirky jokes. On the road you will run into many other survivors. A car of up to 4 jerks. During the trip, you will argue and help each other. Whenever you run into a situation, options available to you will depend on the stats of your party members. A high strength character can fight a bear off. A charming person can sometimes get stuff for free at trader camps. There are also rare characters that have unique personalities, stats, abilities, and their own unique events. You can also make your own characters, and they will sometimes show up in the game. (there are also dogs and cats)Buy NO anime!On the Death Road, you will occasionally find trader camps. The traders are randomized in each camp. Preserved food is used as currency. Sometimes you will even run into rare traders that will trade unique stuff. You need to make very prudent decisions on what to buy and what to sell. When you run out of gas, there is no guarantee that the next trader camp will have a gas trader.”Is the Death Road really as bad as it sounds?”DR2C is brutally difficult and is not for the faint of heart. To survive the Death Road, you need both strategy and luck. DR2C has perma-death, and encourages you to play carefully rather than ruthlessly. The motivation to finish the game doesn’t come from the action itself. Instead, it comes from the story progression, the excitement of getting closer to the Canadian border day by day. tl;drHLTBTakes ~2 hours to go through the entire Death RoadTakes much longer to beat the game because you’ll fail a lotPROS*PERMA-DEATH!!!*The humorGood depthLots of replayability (random events and characters, other game modes)Very fun for local co-opGood soundtrack (10+ tracks)CONSAI is sometimes buggy (Sometimes they get stuck picking up and dropping weapons) fixedMelee becomes useless on the last day, and a high shooting stat is almost essential. A little unfair for strength charactersYour couch friend won’t be able to co-op with you if there is only 1 person in your partyIt can be frustrating at times when you get unlucky "

Death Road To Canada is a randomly generated zombie survival road trip simulator with tough yet rewarding gameplay and hours upon hours of zombie slaughtering fun.StoryDeath Road To Canada follows two survivors of a zombie apocalypse as they try to make their way to the safe confines of the beautiful country of Canada. There is no specific story since the vibe of the game is almost a make-your-own adventure type and RNG does play a high role in the gameplay. Although there is no story as such, along the way you’ll meet new survivors and NPCs (if you stay alive long enough) and there is plenty of dialogue and little random events.General GameplayWhen you start the game you’ll begin with a few supplies like food and medicine and your car (which is where a good chunk of your gameplay will be spent). You’ll travel in your car (or on foot if you happen to run out of gas or break your vehicle) and it’ll be from there you’ll encounter random events, traders, new locations, bandits and even sometimes new survivors to join your group. Travelling in your car will consume gas and travelling no matter how you do it will also consume food which is one of the most important resources. Without food your group will starve, the more they starve the lower their ‘morale’ drops and once a person's morale is completely gone it is highly likely they will abandon the group. The more group members you have the more manpower you wield but also you’ll consume more food so remember that when picking up new survivors.Along your journey you’ll find various location that you’ll have the choice to loot if you wish too but you can also choose to pass them by. Sometimes you’ll find a solitary location and others you’ll find two to pick from and each location's name will be kinda relative to what you find at that location e.g supermarket = food, hardware store = melee weapons. Displayed alongside the location name will also be details of the location you’re about to enter such as the size of the zombie swarm, how aggressive they are and the time of day. These three things massively affect whether you’re successful at that location or not so you do have to take them into consideration when playing or you’ll quickly end up as zombie chow. Once you’ve assigned any weapons you may have to your survivors you can enter your location where you’ll be able to loot and kill at will. You’ll usually find a bit of loot and maybe an NPC, sometimes you’ll find something a little more rare. Each survivor has hidden stats which you won’t be able to see until they need to be used or you level them up for example you won't know if John is a good Mechanic until he tries to fix a car or increases that specific skill. Most survivors start pretty weak but the progression system in the game increases each trait that survivors randomly have as you complete specific things throughout your runs. My favourite part of Death Road To Canada is the ability to add all your friends/family/enemies/acquaintances to the game as survivors you’ll have a chance to meet along the way. You’re able to name them, choose what they look like and wear and their traits and then either load them into your game from the start as your starting survivors or hope to come across them randomly in normal gameplay. There is a mode that increases your chances of coming across custom survivors so if you want to play a game where you’re likely to find all your friends then you can. The Custom Game Mode isn’t the only game mode you’ll find though, there are several ranging from change in difficulty to change in your trip length so there are lots of options for replayability if you manage to beat the normal main campaign (good luck).Sound and GraphicsThe graphics are pixel graphics and though I do enjoy the ‘old-school’ feel to them sometimes I have trouble seeing some things clearly, especially the larger the screen I play it on. The soundtrack is truly fantastic though! Instead of what you’d expect of a normal zombie survival game it takes an upbeat approach instead and the juxtaposition is fantastic. The whole package has a very nice retro feel to it and brings back some nostalgic feelings of the games on older consoles.Pros--- Randomized events, survivors and locations for replayability.--- Local Co-Op so your friends can help you smash some zombies.--- Fantastic soundtrack.--- Difficult yet rewarding gameplay.--- Customizability with survivors you can create yourself to encounter when you play. --- Various game modes--- Awesome soundtrack (yet not available for purchase )-: )---GNOMEY.Cons--- Full controller support yet instructions are keyboard keys only.--- No achievements?!?!?!?!--- Sieges can be a real pain in the...foot. Some are just a little too difficult.SummaryDeath Road To Canada to put it plainly is a great game with a hell of a lot of fun to be had. The randomization and various game-modes adds a great deal of replayability and the fact you can customize the game and add your own characters gives it a great feel. There's plenty of content included and for the hours of gameplay you’ll get out of it the price is more than fair. If you’re not willing to part with the cash right now it’s still a must buy during one of the Steam sales.			"

Product received for free
												Ah yes, yet another zombie game. The brainless corpses are being featured in more and more games, to the point where there isn't much freshness left. So... does this Death Road to Canada manage to bring a new spin on the walking dead? Surprisingly, yes. The playstyle is nothing new and will be imediately fammiliar to every Oregon Trail (and Organ Trail) fan. You control a group of survivers on their way to Canada, where everything is better... well at least people aren't being eaten alive (and even if they are - free healthcare!) The story is not that complicated and very barebone. All you have to know is that the world is populated by zombies and that Canada is 15 driving days away. You start out with two survivers, which you can freely customize. There is quite a lot of different options and everybody can make something to suit their needs. If you're feeling up to it, you can also try rare character mode, where most of the companions you encounter are replaced with people with all sort of special abilities. I'm 8 hours into the game and I'm still often running into new companions, so there is quite a decent variety there. Once you've selected the options you like, you can hit start and be off on your journey.Every character has different attributes, which aren't visible imediately. Instead, you discover them over time by performing different tasks that require that perticular skill. Another thing you have to keep track of are supplies. You have to gather food, fuel, meds and three types of ammo. If you run out of any of the first two, you're basicly screwed since morale also plays a big part in the game.There are two parts to the game. The first one is presented by different encounters, where you get to pick what you want to do in a specific situation. Attributes play a huge rule here, as they can be the difference between loosing half of your supplies and beating the bandits in a flexing competition. There are quite a lot of different random events and while you can evade sometimes prevent the negative outcome, this isn't always the case. This means you can sometimes loose a big hunk of supplies (expecialy if you run out of fuel) and even members of the group, which can get quite annoying. Sure, a bit of randomness is welcome, however to much of it can make you feel salty when everything goes to hell.The second part of the game consists of exploring of areas, populated by zombies. These include different types of missions, such as sieges and scavenging missions, to name a few. They get harder and harder over time and the same holds for the number of zombies, which can sometimes reach over 100 corpses at a time. This means that sometimes it's better to avoid them instead of trying to kill them, since they just keep on coming. Fortunately, there is quite a lot of different weapons and this does help to keep things interesting. From the graphics standpoint, the game looks decent but nothing special. The pixelated graphics do help it run smoothly even on older systems and integrated graphic cards, which is a big plus if your computer is a bit outdated. Another thing I'd point out is the soundtrack. Some of the reviewers stated that they got annoyed by it after a couple of hours, but I'm still loving it - It just fits so well. Conclusion:Initialy, I've had a bit of a hard time deciding wheather I should recommend Death Road to Canada or not. Mostly because it isn't that cheap (you could argue 15$ is cheap) and there is a lot of randomness that can often screw you over. In the end however, I've decided to put my recommendation on it. I've had quite a lot of fun playing and every run I made seemed unique. While I still haven't managed to finish the game on normal mode, I've still had my share of fun. You know what they say - Sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. Final Rating: 7.8/10			"

												Pros:+Pick up and play or spend time customizing characters+Overall progression as well as current playthrough progression+Hilarious writing and theme+Simple gameplay, graphics, and sound (you might be able to play this on a ten-year-old computer)+Rare events add extra replay value, ensuring that you'd have to play dozens of times to see everythingCons:-Random difficulty even in normal will make you start over from the beginning and play again because you keep telling yourself ""this will be the one"" until you realize it's 2 in the morning on a school night (is that a con?)-Only time I beat it was when a dog I didn't even like was good at running awayIf you like roguelike-likes, Oregon Trail type games, zombies, retro graphics, humor, and making characters based on your family and friends and watching them die horribly for stupid reasons, you will like this game.On the other hand, if you think the destination is more important than the journey, this game will frustrate you like no other. Don't expect to be able to make it to Canada every time, even if you think you're prepared for everything.10/10 would sacrifice myself and all I love to save a stupid dog again			"

												Got DANG is this game unforgiving, one misguided decision and your entire run is ruined. Get the chainsaw or a special character with a strong weapon, try not to lose it/them. Don't have too many animals on the team (unless you're going for ""cheevos""), they can't hold a lot usually and most animals can't drive if you run out of humans; only dogs can. Look at your characters' stats and skills: they will help you make key decisions that will make or break your run. Don't lose your car.Pros:• Play as almost anyone: make characters of your friends and family, be a random famous pop culture icon, several different animals. Give custom characters useful perks and skills to balance your team.• Each playthrough feels fresh and unique• Character stats are surprisingly intricate and faithful to the history of roguelikes• Music is pretty killer (although sometimes they loop somewhat less than seamlessly • New team members can be recruited fairly quickly, keeping the gameplay fresh• RNG is your best friendCons:• Weapon stamina works in an unorthodox kind of way, can be obstructive at times• Very easy to get stuck behind rubble or a wall, making yourself easy pickings for a nasty horde• Very easy to completely fk up your game with a single bad decision• jfk this game is fckin hard as hell how do I get past the last seige• RNG is Satan incarnateOverall: good, clean, humorous, soul-crushingly-difficult zombie-killin' character-buildin' fun. Be mindful of your neighbors when you scream after losing. "

												This game will make you laugh and cry. It's like Oregon trail but with zombies and humor. First few tries, you don't mind dying but after that you just want to finish so when you do it feels amazing.Pretty dificult sometimes even with the, ""Rare Characters"" mode which makes it easier to find unusual but powerful characters.Make tough choices.Tell people to, ""COOL IT""Tell people to, ""SAY IT DON'T SPRAY IT""Interesting dialogue.Dogs.A Gnome riding a rat.Rob friendly traders because you need supplies.Leave your team members in a horde of zombies so they can probably unwillingly sacrifice themselves for youTell traders that, ""Anime isn't real"" until you stumble upon an anime girl that shoots hearts from a magical wand up until she explodes from becoming increasing kawaii.Get angry when your team mates swap out their good weapons that you gave them for random♥♥♥♥♥♥weapons.Be disheartened when you realize you'll have a hard and frustrating time completing the game because there's only two guides on steam relating to the game.G E T  P U M P E D  U P.Grunt with internal rage when one of your chracters throws a molotov or some kind of bomb and it kill one of your team.(I'd recommend just staying away from molotovs altogether)Surprising amount of character creation customization.Create your family and friends only to have them die in glorious zombie combat because they have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fitness and strength stats.Laugh with glee as you get amazing lucky events such as finding toilet paper.Glance nervously at the clock during a siege because you've been backed into a corner and you're desperate for a way out of the mess you got yourself into.Feel obligated to play this game until you make it to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Canada.Have a party member named Canada so certain dialogue is funny.Get killed by stupid things like climbing a tree and team mates turning out to be STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING TRASH.Get attacked by bees.Get attacked by feral dogs.Get attacked by bears.Get attacked by meese.Get attacked by feral cats.I found this game really enjoyable for the time that I played it, which wasn't really 45 hours, I just happened to leave my PC on overnight a few times with the game open. I told myself that I would play the game more after I initially finished it the first time but when I started a new playthrough right after I actually finished it, I kept thinking I wanted to take a break and play a different game. Still, for $15 dollars this game is to me, a must have because it's 100% worth the experience.10/10 would tell people to  C O O L  I T  again.			"

												This game has everything,Lunk will practice his spin attack in the car if he's unhappy....and kill your team.A goofy clown will transport you to a haunted clown-of-the-dead cabin for a night of terror.Dogs can be thrown into science machines to become dog-men....that will waste all of you ammo.Elvis will threaten the light a bridge on fire and trap a group of people unless they back down...and then he burns it down anyway!The freest man in the world roams on foot at inscredible speed wearing nothing but a horse mask.I can go on and on, but just go see for yourself!  The rare character mode alone is enough for a great game, but when you get creative and add your own characters based on friends/family/popular celebs (I like making a Doc Brown and Rick Sanchez party of custom characters to start a trip), and then if they see me with a dog on the side of the raod you better believe it's going to be an amazing adventure.

												No dysentery yet, however was rude to a clown which in turn caused a witches morale to drop, resulting in said witch stealing our SUV and most of our supplies the following evening. We set out that morning on foot with the lowest morale yet. As it turns out all the crying and staring at the ground attracted bandits who completely surprised us and forced our group to surrender half our remaning supplies. The result of this was a ragged band of walking shells. No hope, no morale, down to our last supplies and still forced to march on. Then all of a sudden: MIRACLE! A fully stocked base on the horizon. We made it!  We made it......and that's when the feral dogs surrounded us.			"

A nice little gem of a game that's loads of fun especially when you make all the characters as people you know... their deaths really impact you.While their are some cheap moments in the game and occasional bad random roles for the most part the game seems pretty fair and balanced.If you liked Organ Trail and Dead Pixels you'll love this game!

												I very rarely will invest money into a full price pixel art indie game, but this one was well worth the financial risk. There is an immense amount of replayability and gameplay variations spread throughout the game to keep you unaware of you're current time of day. This is something that would also be perfect to have on a 3ds or PS Vita, no doubt. There is a consistent sense of humour spread throughout in this game that does not feel forced in anyway. It's been a while since I've laughed at a video game's content. (Glitches and dumb multiplayer high jinks doesn't count)Yeah, it's a good game. Give it a look!			"

												- See character creation has ""friend of dog"" as an option.- Create chibi survivor version of the dog whisperer ""Cesar""- Recruit rotating small army of disposable dogs (and a witch's cat) to scavange and fight for me- Have dog named Quinton save Bruce Lee and is taught Kung Fu as reward- Kung Fu dog Quinton becomes only survivor of nasty hoard attacking alien ship- Surprised (though at this point I shouldn't be) that Quinton learns to drive the car - Using him I finish the quest down ther death road to Canada!* When I own a dog IRL I am going to name it Quinton...10/10 would wrestle sasquatch again.

One More For The RoadWhen I first saw this game before release, I thought it was ok.After the Dog Release Trailer, I was very intrigued.Then Vinny from Vinesauce and his ""virtual-self who will never see Canada due to everything killing him"" sold it for me.     I love this game. This game, without a doupt, has that ""One more go and I'll stop but you keep playing"" hold on you. The combat reminds me of Dark Souls where you must pace yourself. The music is catchy and will put you in a good mood no matter how bad your day IRL was. The comedic outcomes of events are fantastic, showing that this whole journey is for the fun then for the zombie drama. The characters will always make you laugh with the stupid stuff they get into, even in death. It's just wonderful.     The game has a few flaws but nothing a patch won't fix like AI characters geting stuck juggling duplicate weapons on the ground, items on Y'all Mart shelfs not being clearly visiable for picking up, not knowing what day it is (looking at you Monday) and not being able to ""Always Be Looting"" whenever you wish. Overall, this game worth every can of food. If I were to suggest a few things to add to this game-3DS/Vita PortsI need this on the go, please!4 Player Online/MMO Co-Op2 Player Local Co-Op is nice but I don't have anyone to play with. Online would help. While your at it, bump it up to 4 players for more mayhem. Prehaps while playing Online we may bump into another player who needs help and team up for a bit.Rare Character Select and More Rare CharactersI feel once a rare character is found, you should be able to play as them when starting up a new game, but only in the mode they were found in. (i.e Found Lank in Rare Mode, Lank is playable in all Rare Mode Options.) The current selection of Rare Characters is hillarious but we need more; like Doomguy, Issac, Mayro, Sanic, Puc-Man, The L4D and Dead Island Survivors, the Protect-Me Knights/Gotta Protectors, Fazbear & Friends, Robbie Rotten, and more!More Rare RidesJust more please. I could list so many; The Time Travaling DeLorean, Mad Max's Machine, Classic Ecto 1, The Bat Mobile, Santa's Sleigh, Cars from Wacky Racers, TF2 Sniper's Camper Van, The Flintstone's Car, Thomas the Tank Engine's Bertie Bus (Hell thrown in Thomas as well cause why not?), and more! No Hitch-hikers Allowed ModePick 1-4 characters and they will be the only ones you can play with.USA Tour ModeTour ALL 50 States before reaching Canada. Starting in Florida and ending in Alaska; To Canada or Bust.More Custom Character OptionsMore Heads, Hairs, Skin tones, Body sizes, Misc, Clothing, Perks, Save slots, and more please! Also, Saveable Stats, Choice of starting weapon, and an option for Rare Perks earned by Rare Characters (or least they bump a perk up to 4 stars).More AnimalsI wanna see more crazy animals to team up with or even ride. Ask Jontron if his ""Robotic bird"" Jacques can be put in to shoot zombies with his lazor beam eyes.More ZambiesDon't take that too literal, I'm more refering to more looks and even ""Speical Infected"". Custom Zombie Maker, maybe?Level EditorAn option to make our own maps that may randomly generate into the mix of places to visit.Seriously, worth every can of food so far, keep up the good work.			"

												A fun and light-hearted game with a self-aware sense of humor, but it manages to do this without sacrificing being interesting to play.I'd sum this up as having a similar gameplay model to the classic Oregon Trail updated for the 21st century, but with zombie themed events and action sequences. It can be a bit tough to get started some runs, but this game does pull off one of the keys to a good rogue-like; it can still be fun to die too. There's also an in-game editor which allows you to add custom characters, which you can use to put yourself, your friends, your favourite memes, or whatever into the game. Nothing quite like trying to survive the zombie apocalypse with Bill Murray and JOHN CENA at your side. The game also pumps out sets of random characters as well as a few preset legendary ones (so far only one I've unlocked an achievement for is an armored knight character).On the whole I find this game an extremely fun diversion, and it seems like they are still adding more updates so who knows what is yet to come.

												Death Road to Heart AttackThis here is a short quirky like zombie survival story with packed replayability with the multiple modes you can choose to activate for your run. No one cares about the rest though because there is one mode that will make you think you are dying! In DR2C there is a mode that allows you to create avatars with limited visual cusomization paired with an expertise or something like that and a trait option. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMIRY! SO I myself did so. The mode called familiar faces made it so the charac ters you would encounter would first pull from the pool of all your ""friends and family.""In short I went on an adventure with familiar peoples in an intense situation. There were laughs, we would argue. At times we wouldn't speak to each other, or maybe we would discuss art and the moon nonstop. The characters attitude variations may not be exact on point, but when you see it, it is close enough. I felt their fear and screams as we lost our car to bandits, when we were chased to our new graves inside that damn bar. I have PTSD now 10/10 this♥♥♥♥♥♥is better than the christopher walkin dead!!!			"

												This game is so much fun but it  could be like 50 % better if it hadnt such devestating RNG ...... i had 2 survivors with maxed out mechanic skill and i repaired my car 2 times with no problems. i was 2 driving days away from canada and i wanted to loot 1 final building. when i arrive at the mission, all my characters get out of the car when suddenly, completely out of nowhere, my car explodes !!! the explosion killed 3 out of 4 survivors leaving the leader in a humongous group of zombies with only a sledgehammer and a rifle (sledgehammer is one of the slowest weapons in the game and the rifle i had was a not auto at all ....). you can probably make out what happened next.... I got killed in seconds and i had 0 chance of getting out ! I can deal with randomness to a certain degree but when i have a perfect run and my almost guaranteed win gets taken away by something so ridiculous, i just cant take it serious anymore ! but all rng besides, i really enjoy the game and its pretty easy to spend hours on it. also you can make your own characters ( the left 4 dead crews fit perfectly) and meet them on the Death Road to Canada !

The Rare Characters mode is also a treat, as an already-lighthearted game swerves into gleeful absurdity at times. This is a fantastic way to spend a few hours at a time!			"

												I loved Darkest Dungeon, the idea of sending a party of your friends into random situations is a great one. Death Road to Canada uses a similar system, however instead of walking through dungeons you are adventuring on to Canada. On your way to Canada you will experience a vast number of different events. These events can range from meeting travellers that end up joining your party to encountering bandit, bodybuilding enthusiasts. These events are the foundation for the game and offer plenty of re-playability to the game itself. ExplorationMoving on from the in-game events, lets address one of the negatives I have with the game, exploration. Each building you venture into is extremely lacking in the creativity department. Most buildings will be filled with gas, food and weapons. The problem is to find all of them, you will want to search every room, this creates very boring scenarios of you and your friend searching through empty rooms which are literally empty. They could have atleast added some furniture to make them feel more authentic, but instead if you enter a room with nothing but a bunch of garbage blocking off a door. You instantly know to turn around because it will be one of the MANY empty and pointless rooms in this game. Just to clarify my criticism here Is that the rooms are completely baron of ANYTHING, they didn’t have to contain usable items, but I would have liked to see these rooms contain some sort of personality or baring. Not only did this make exploration, long and arduous but it really encouraged players to skip exploring entirely If they already had enough supplies to last them a while. Visuals/GraphicsAnd now is the part of every review where I talk graphics. Now this game has that same pixelated art style we have all become VERY familiar with over the years. It seems that after one game tried using this retro look EVERY possible indie promotion started using it for reasons I can’t recognise. Luckily here it fits decently, as the world created around your survivors is wacky enough to fit the strange 80’s style visuals. PerformanceNo surprise here with its low CPU and GPU intensive graphics, the game runs fineand they offer you some nice, complementary options; fliters for the screen if you want to go full 80's mode, stylistic screen tearing toggle options and fully rebindable keys. I should also mention that all actions in the game can be changed on controller as well as the keyboard, when you are playing co-op with a friend I found that this was a nifty addition to controller users.MusicAs for the music, it’s quite strange. Normally in a zombie game where you’re fighting for survival you wouldn’t have fun up-beat music sounding off in the background. But much like the visuals it works well with the cheesy game the developers are creating. It took me a while to get used to it but after I did, I can’t imagine going back to the solemn soundtracks of past zombie games. CombatCombat feels decent enough, it doesn’t take away anything from the game but it felt too basic to warrant praise of any kind. In combat you can use guns, melee weapons and explosives. Melee weapons use up your character’s stamina, your character’s stamina is measured in the traits your character has unlocked. Obviously more physically athletic survivors will be able to use their melee weapon for longer without getting tired. The gun play is fine, the game automatically locks on to zombies you are facing which works well enough. I am slightly dissapointed as it felt like the developers were catering a little too much to the controller users rather than the much more plentiful keyboard and mouse users, thsi is ecspecially the case with the gun play, it felt like their main goal was to dumb it down completely so that controller users wouldn't be left behind by the vastly superior PC controls. But in saying that, it's not necessarily a bad system of combat, I just feel like it takes away the benefit of using a keyboard and mouse to a slight degree, and let me highlight the word slight, this is a MINOR nitpick. ConclusionOverall Death Road to Canada is a fun game to play with your friends, you can laugh at the random events that occur and dance to the funky music playing in the background while killing zombies constantly. However, without friends this game is quite bland, exploration is quite a linear experience and on your own the combat feels dreadfully average.			"

												I was skeptical about the price, but I feel that it was well worth it.I had fun going through my first run, although many people died along the way (aka my gf and a hunky luchador).Despite that, I managed to make it to the final seige with my leader but died at the final moment.The humorous dialogue, simple albeit fun combat, and random events kept me entertained.I'll be sure to play more, as each run leaves a different flavour. 8/10Note: I had only experienced one crash during the game, which had little effect on my playthrough.

												I have to say, it's like people said!It's Organ Trail and all it's others systems. I'm getting pretty addicted to this game and wanting to get to Canada (as my character of course).You start off as a survivor and maybe a buddy wanting to go to Canada as heard from the game is the safest place in the World and go through many places to gather supplies and loot to survive your road trip there. With the RNG system you can either get good or bad rolls. It can also depend on your character's traits and perks to which the system gives you. Usually the trait gives good and bad side effects and the perk gives you a good one. The game starts to get difficult as you progress through the game and gets pretty intense too. The only troubles I've been having are sieges being really difficult especially with the RNG paths it gives me, but it doesn't stop me from giving hope that I can make it to Canada! So far I've made it to Canada once in Rare Characters mode. L*nk (Don't sue N*ntendo) is pretty much the the best Rare Characters from at least my view since his sword upgrades  are pretty much OP.I highly recommend this game for people who love Organ Trail and difficult games.10/10 for me! :D			"

												I been playing this game on and off my stream for a couple days now. I been hosting races as well. I bought this game blindly over the simple fact that the name spoke to me, and I am glad I did. With me being a huge zombie fan and actually moving to Canada in a month I just had to get it. Every run I have of this game I am smiling, laughing, or genuinely worried.Now let's talk about the game. It's very fun! Like Oregon Trail but with the action sequences reminding me of Gauntlet or any over the top action game. I never truly feel safe, which is a good thing. Anything can happen, for example, have a lot of food? Well sorry you had a hole in your bag. Doing okay on health? Feral cats attack. The humor and randomness make this game feel unique. The game is simple and easy to learn but hard enough that I failed every run thus far. I encountered a few issues here and there but nothing game breaking, I considered it apart of the adventure. When I first streamed this game my viewers loved it and a few purchased it. They been playing a lot and not one of them has anything really negative to say. So this review is technically coming from 7 or so people. Out of what I seen between us all, none of us have gotten further then day 1 remaining and the variety makes each trip special. We all made each other in the cute character creator and go on the adventure with another. It gives us stories and funny screen shots to share. We all love Death Road To Canada!TL:DR I turned into a Dogataur would highly recommend! 10/10 Poutines.			"

												I should probably mention that I've only played 8.7 hours and I've only ever played Familiar Characters Mode, so I haven't fully explored the game yet, but from what I've played, I can say it's one of my most favorite games of 2016. The gameplay is extremely fun and never seemed to grow boring, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and the graphics are brilliant. And even though I haven't played it as much recently, I still have the soundtrack stuck in my head. If you've played games like Oregon Trail or Super Amazing Wagon Adventure and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this. I recommend this game fully, I fail to see how anybody could hate this game after playing it. There are so many different modes which just adds more playability. I feel like there could be more customization, but for what they have right now is great. Overall a great game and definitely in my top 5 games for 2016, highly recommend for anybody.			"

												I haven't been addicted to this hard of a game since Binding of Isaac. And be prepared, you WILL die about as often.Despite almost 30 hours of playtime, I still haven't crossed the border. You learn as you go. I find there is a meta game emerging, but I want to have success naturally, and that means carving out a strategy death by death. Great style, replayability, strategy, humor, and dogs. Dogs may be the best part of this game. I am continually surprised with the genuine laughter that happens due to the random events in this game. The music alternates from go-get-'em to surprisingly relaxed, every tune getting stuck in your head but with enough variety that it never gets old. Get this game. The developers know what they're doing. Each run just makes you want to go again, because you always feel like you were JUST SO CLOSE.			"

												First playthrough:  Was doing fine until we came across a goat, and I made the mistake of inviting him into the party. He immediately kicked and killed my lead character, was a jerk to everybody else in the car, and refused to leave the party when I came across another far more useful survivor. He refused to wield any useful weapons (preferring to drop them at the most inopportune times when we were being swarmed by zombies.) As he was the only character with any health left, I posted him on guard while the rest of the party slept, and he immediately fell asleep allowing all of our food and medical supplies to get stolen. Dangerously low on morale and health, he caused a huge argument that caused us to run off the road straight into a massive swarm of zombies, who massacred everyone but the goat. The goat then decided he didn't care two ☠☠☠☠s about Canada, and proceeded to walk off into the sunset. This is actually the closest I've come to winning the game so far.10/10 - Would have my entire party killed by an evil backstabbing goat again.			"

												Got it as a gift from a friend. Cute game, lots of really cute and good ideas, but the gameplay is so frustratingly simple and the rng is stacked against you that it just becomes a slog to play through. You could be having a great time and then suddenly it throws at you a 2 hour long (ingame) seige with the worst settings, trapping you inside a tiny room with hundreds of zombies you can't do anything about. There is literally nothing you can do other than die in most cases. You can't even aim with your guns properly, even if your stats are high with it, because of the way the controls work. The game also goes for way too long for one default run so you'll be sitting there bashing your keyboard/game controller trying to start your car until your hands cramp.I wouldn't recommend it personally, but can definitely see the appeal and you may get more mileage out of it than I did.

												The only game in existence that could make the apocalypse look like the funniest thing in the world.And I really mean it, the soundtrack is glorious and betrays the whole atmosphere of the game.Surrounded by zombies? This catchy tune will help you numb the pain.No fuel for your car? How about something upbeat, so you won't think about your invetiable demise?Swarmed by an army of zombies and no bullets left? Time for a groovy tune, to serve as your funeral song.10/10It also contains magical girls, dogs that wield machetes, Not Link nor Lonk and much more.			"

 Target Audience:    Roguelike Action Fans Summary:  Death Road To Canada is the essence of action roguelike gameplay: replayability, and yet simplicity with hidden layers of gameplay. While making your way to the land north of America, you'll be put into binds and situations that will force split-second decisions that can doom you. The mixture of the action gameplay along with the Oregon Trial like strategy gameplay works together rather well: as both end up enhancing the gameplay and choices of the other. And like a good roguelike: it's difficult, but manageable, forcing you to make difficult decisions that's not just there for show. It's the risk and reward mechanics that shine here: really rewarding you in pushing as far as your team can go without breaking, but punishing you heavily if you push too far. Sure, you're going to struggle with some of the controls at first. But these are the right kind of “inaccurate” controls: controls that complement the gameplay in question. The only major problem I have with the game is the crashes (which is being addressed by the developer), and the AI can be REALLY dumb at times, getting itself killed rather easily. But if you like anything in the roguelike genre mixed with action, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not picking up Death Road To Canada. It'll probably be on my “underrated games of the year” list, as it's not going to get the mainstream attention that it should. But you should give it your attention. Video Review:  


YouTube™ Video: Death Road To Canada (Critical Eye): Emergency Plans 

			Views: 318		

			Because Canada can save us from anything. This Key was obtained from the developer for review purposes. Everything is better in Canada.		

 Lists: Positives: Keeps the pressure on. Once you get past the first few days, you're feeling every battle. Resources are a godsend, and you'll never feel comfortable.  A great example of a good risk/reward system. Pushing your team to its edge in getting resources before the night comes, but pushing too far will usually hurt your team and maybe get it killed.  Smart decision making is rewarded. Understanding your teams strengths, and what option to choose based on it, will result in the appropriate outcome 90% of the time. There's just enough RNG added here to make things interesting, without making you feel like you're not in control.  Morale system in particular is actually implemented with some thought put behind it, and makes a difference when trying to go further and further.  You'll have to make hard decisions. Actual hard decisions. Not decisions that actually don't mean jack♥♥♥♥♥♥in the end. Like “Choose between these two characters. One goes away.”  Combat may be simple, but it's effective. It's about space management, and forces the player to think about how they can escape a room without losing anyone. It may be repetitive: but it's the good kind of repetitive. It's more about strategy and smart decisions made.  Some nice alternate weaponry that serves a specific purpose, like the cardboard tube. This gives you more reasons to vary up your arsenal.  Use of the environment is rewarded. Walking into a room with 50 zombies, only to yell “NOPE” and close the door behind you actually rewards you if you can get out without them noticing. Forcing enemies to bite through furniture can give you the space you need in order to deal with hordes.   I like the control set for the most part here, even if it can be unwieldy at times. The thing is, it complements the combat and the tone that the gameplay is going for. You're not supposed to be a super Walking Dead gunslinger. You're just bob from the local diner. It will actually take some time and experience in order to actually be a bad♥♥♥♥♥ It's always fun to run across the different popular media and video game characters in the world they've created here. Adding Octodad to the team? Yeah, I dig it.  It's that goofy kind of realism. There's feral cats, Zombies, aliens, and gators you wrestle. And yet, for some reason, you think this is reasonable given the universe, and can see it happen. Oh, and the whole Octodad thing. Negatives: As of right now, I've had several crashes, but the developer is diligently working to solve the problems in question. Note that Windows 10 users may need to be weary of it. Your AI partners can be.....very very dumb. Walking into zombies without any thought process what so ever if you get even the least bit separated.  Wanted to see a button dedicated to switch characters. Would have made things a lot smoother in terms of using that feature.  Some of the randomness of the weapon degradation can be annyoing, because you really don't know what some of your weapons conditions are.  The visual style just doesn't help the game out in the end. It's got a lot of customization and elements that would be taken to the next level if it had the visual elements behind it.  "

												Highly recommended. Great retro style graphics with a clear design and aesthetic throughout and awesome gameplay to go right along with it. Combines excellent action elements with enough randomly generated events to continue to be awesome, interesting, and different on each run through. Easy to pick up but rewards repeated plays as you try different combinations of characters and if the developers past games are any indication expect some great additional content updates.			"

												This game will f&$% you up. You need to have the holy power of the RNG to survive. Now, that does not make this a bad game, it makes it realistic, for a zombie apocalypse anyways. I started off with two people. All was going well, then we met another guy, and we let him join. Then, a seige happened. A seige is where you have to hold out long enough before escaping, which can last a while. My original partner died. Blah Blah Blah anime katanas, blah blah blah Prius, and we find a girl, and let her join. Blah Blah Blah Raiders, Blah Blah Blah Supermarket, another seige. Now this time, there's two other people trapped in here with us, a police officer, and what looked like a scientist. My guy was the only survivor, after we all got cornered, and I was the only person who tried to run through the zombies, instead of fighting them. So I drive for a while longer, nobody else shows, supplies are running low, and I find this car, which looks like it has supplies. Aaaaaand the keys are missing. I walk around the surrounding area ducking and weaving, trying to find the keys, and then I find this log cabin, which is overrun with ZED, I try to run inside, but get pinned in a corner, like those I had left behind, and I died fighting. So yeah, amazing brand new game, go play it now.			"

												Brilliant!As I sit here to review this game, I don't even know what I would call it. It's a unique retro arcade rogue-like game that has made me laugh time and again.In the game you either pick a random character or design one and an optional friend with same mechanic. You hop in a car Oregon Trail style and drive 15 days to Canada. Almong the way you battle zombies and make decisions that will ultimately decide if you are going to make it. And making it is difficult!You pick up weapons, level up stats, gather loot, and generally have a good time bringing meyhem to zombies!This game gets two thumbs up from me! "

												Death Road To Canada is an action rpg that has alot of charm and reminded me of a modern Oregon Trail game. You have some very tough decisions to make on you're journey to Canada that really effect the game and there are also some sections that have action oriented gameplay and zombies all over the place, the game can get brutal!Don't let the cute, old school pixel style graphics fool you, it is very challenging and will keep you on you're toes at all times. The dialogue is well written, the game is very funny and random events are all very well done.You have to manage you're group of people as you try and make it from Florida to Canada. Like Oregon Trail before it, you must manage many things, including fuel, weapons, guns and food. One aspect I love, that I mentioned above is some of the tough choices you have, which remind me of a good rpg. Each game has been very different so far and I can see a good amount of replay value to this game. Did I mention make you're decisions wisely? Sometimes things as small as letting someone join you're group, to going to find loot and losing one or all of you're group members.Sometimes the vehicle will break down, if one of you're characters is a mechanic they can fix it, if you get jumped by bandits you must make the decision to pass over of you're hard each food/gas/ammo to the bandits or attack them. All of the random events and choices are very welll written to and alot of the time are very hard choices that take a little while to decide what you want to pick. You will also have to pick weither to stop and check out some houses or stores along you're way, sure it would be nice to get some more food, ammo or gas but at what cost? You might get jumped by the zombies and it could all end there. Do you check out the city or keep driving and going to the next one? If you have a friend or family member around you can also get them to hop in at times and control one of you're gorup members. One aspect I wish this game had was coop for people that are not in the same house. Local coop is cool but boy would this be fun with friends from other countries or cities. The other aspect I had some issues with was the crashes, I had 4 or 5 crashes during my many hours on the game. And lastly, the controls for keyboard and mouse could be improved, thankfully it handles flawless with a controller.Still the good far outweigh the bad as Death Road To Canada brings a wonderful new, zombie style take on the Oregon Trail formula and does most of it very very well. The writing is top notch, the game has a ton of charm, the gameplay is fun, you have tough choices to make and it has good replay value.  This is a game that I find really good for an hour at a time and I can see myself playing much more over the next year. A few minor issues didn't take away from  the enjoyment I had while playing this game. Each time you restart it feels like a new experience, interested to see what new things the developers add in the future. Get ready for a hell of a ride with Death Road To Canada! Oh yeah, one last thing, never let a clown in you're vehicle if you see one on the side of the road!**I got a copy of this game to review from the developers. This is the rough draft of the review, the final/edited version will be up on the website sometime this week or next week**			"

												A very fun game, but not without it's faults. While I enjoy each run I do, mostly due to the excellent soundtrack and humor, I've yet to actually reach Canada, though. Pretty much every time I get to the last day I've been stopped by an overwhelmingly huge siege of zombies in a tiny room, and my team dies pretty quickly afterwards. Not sure if the final massive wave is a set event or if I'm just unlucky, since my sample size is admittedly pretty small. It might be this game's version of Oregon Trail's river challenge, but unlike dodging rocks on a river, a siege of that size seems kinda impossible to complete.I get that it's a survival game (which is one of the main things keeping me from becoming frustrated with bad RNG,) but I feel like the difficulty curve makes it really hard to recommend this to a general audience. If you're a results-driven person who needs to win to have fun or feel a sense of accomplishment, I think this game would be very frustrating. If you're okay with just seeing how far you can get and letting the trip ride out while enjoying some excellent music, I think you'd have a pretty good time. That said - even while I enjoy the journey, I feel like my best runs would be much more satisfying if I actually felt as if I had any chance of succeeding near the end. I have a really fun time playing, but it's sort of disappointing to have a run where you play/manage your resources well to only have the game tell you ""nah, not this time, buddy.""What I'm saying is, it's a fun game, and a good way to burn some time, but could be a lot more satisfying with a rebalance patch or a casual mode. Either could make the game much more accessible, I think.			"

												This game is as addicting as it is similar to playing FTL but with zombies and decisions. You and your party have to escape to the borders of Canada since the USA is having a zombie apocalypse and oh boy, you will have a variety of choices and events in your journey since the destination is sort of like reaching Mt Everest or finding a lost treasure. In gameplay, you have to loot resources from places from food to gas, weapons, etc in order to survive the journey. But be careful, zombies in this game are numerous so you have to be hasty or cautious depending on what you're dealing with and have to battle your way in and out. You also have to plan ahead as your resources easily run out.Pros:+ Replayability (You will get a lot of game overs if you're not prepared. The fact you have plenty of customization as well as events to help you succeed is why it's really enjoyable whenever I repeat the game. Wanna go Leeroy Jenkins? Get a BERSERK character. Rather play safe and smart? Paranoid characters are your brains.)+ Variety (Characters, weapons, events, cars, etc, I lost count how many events there are and some are even references to characters from games, movies, real life people, etc. I won't spoil who but it's a lot fun discovering the silly references the devs put in. The characters also have their own stats and traits so keep in mind on them. )+ Customization (You can customize characters that you wanna put in like naming them  because they'll appear in the game when you find them. The strong parts are the traits and perks you can put in which have their pros and cons. They can help you or betray you depending on the situation)+ Music (For a zombie apocalypse game, it sure fits well with some happy ones as well as 'LET'S KICK SOME ZOMBIE BUTT"" music. Very enjoyable. )+ Graphics (Pixel art as the main art style, it's simple but it shows it really well. I do wish the characters faces look a little better but hopefully in a sequel or such, they'll make it better)+ Dogs/Cats are playable (They can loot and shoot...SOLD! )I don't have much cons for this game but I'll just give my little nit picksNitpicks:- RNG (RNG is what makes the fun and despair of a game though I feel that a lot of bad stuffs happen more to me IMO. Though that's part of the fun so take this as a grain of salt.)- More character customization ( I know this is a pro but I do want more clothes or at least a workshop for this game. If there's mods I would love to see it happen)Overall, I give this game a 9/10. I would have given it a 10 if it had a lot more customization than now because the game literally screams for one. If this game were to get a sequel then I'd be a happy man. If you love zombies, surviving, FTL-like games, maybe this might be for you. Otherwise, just look at a video or 2 of gameplay and see if it convinces you to buy.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!			"

												Although there have been other games that throw Oregon Trail’s ideas into a zombie apocalypse, like some of the best roguelikes (Dungeons of Dredmor being another), Death Road balances its difficulty with a ton of humor and a lighthearted soundtrack. Whenever you lose a party member to zombie death or an unlucky bee sting, there’s some gag or funny line there to break the tension. In one playthrough, I:Rode across the apocalypse in an ice cream truckLifted barbells in a zombie-filled gym, boosting my strengthTore through the undead with a mopDeclined to purchase animeWas attacked by ants in my sleepBefriended an Elvis doppelgängerWas ambushed by a ranting old man who, despite not looking dangerous, killed meI also love that you can create and save custom characters—I re-created the duo from Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

												You better COOL IT!(mini-review)Fantastic game, seriously. Music and visuals are top-notch and the game has a lot of humour and personality. It's super fun adding your own characters to it too. I also like the interactive aspect, which allows you to scavenge for supplies and control how you get them, rather than have it be completely RNG. Experienced no crashes over 7 hours, but apparently they are there for others.It's a lovely game, and game from Rocketcat. Definitely check it out if you're up for an Organ Trail esque game...TO CANADA!(full review after I play more of it soon)			"

												A pretty solid release, actually. I went in expecting it to be a generic game with not a whole lot in the way of dynamic story or gameplay, but I got charmed by its atmosphere. Admittedly, the gameplay isn't much, but it's not inept or tedious enough for me to get mad at it. The dynamic story however is a great feature, as different orgeon-trail style events transpire to spice up gameplay. From intelligent dogs to Giant Farts Monthly, the game is never short on curveballs to therow at you. It's a genuinely funny game that doesn't lean too hard on reference humor. Also, side note, but the character customization is oodles of fun. I spent probably an hour or so just making my characters. The best part of it is that they can sometimes show up in the game, so Johnny Joes the master mechanic is not just tied down to being picked as my buddy. The gameplay is the only real weak point of this game, but it's perfectly passable and probably going to get better as the game grows (fingers crossed). There's worse ways to spend 15 bucks, and for what you get, I'd call it worth the asking price. I'd reccomend Death Road to Canada if you're looking for an Orgeon-Trail styled game with a lot of charm and hours upon hours of potential gameplay.			"

												An addicting game no lie. It's very fun and can definitely eat up hours of your time before you know it. The rare characters you meet in this game can be very interesting to come across and the events that happen can tip the scales in your favor or not. It truly is an interesting experience with every new run you make.Oh and you can also create your own characters as well, which is great for making your friends, family, or just nonsense characters join you on your deadly road trip to Canada.It's a great game to play and I highly recommend it.

												Buy this game!Death Road is an ingenious combination of apocalyptic horror and lighthearted road trip comedy.So many elements are done just right:* Zombie combat - Perfect.  Slow zombies only, as it should be.  One or two?  Trivial.  A crowd?  Impossible.  Super simple, straightforward gameplay that gets deeper with every new situation.  Navigating a crowd is seat-of-the-pants excitement.  How big a horde will you dare to get one more can of food?* Resource management - Fantastic.  The balance is just right.  You'll always need more gas, more food, more bullets, more medicine, because you're always running out ... but with luck, there's always an opportunity to get more.  Low on meds?  That drugstore is a good place to loot - but then you pass up the opportunity to look for groceries.  Maybe it's time to leave someone behind so there's one less mouth to feed - but then your team will lose fighting strength.  Decide quick!  They're coming.There are very few right or wrong answers.  It's all about what trade-off you're willing to make to last one more day on the Death Road.* Road events.  That's right!  The ""road trip"" part of the description isn't a joke.  You don't spend ALL of your time hacking through armies of undead.  Plenty of time is spent on the road, cruising between hotspots.  Look for supplies, avoid bandits, meet traders, get in arguments in the car.  Like in any road trip, you never quite know what the next bend in the highway will bring, and again these events lead to more choices.  Fight the bandits and risk injury, or give up some food?  Waste gas driving around an obstacle or plow the car right through it and see what happens?  No right or wrong, just ""I hope this works!""* RPG elements - Light and Tight!  With characters dying left and right, a complex stat system would be inappropriate here, but what there is is meaningful and involving.  Stats, skills, and unique character traits have direct impact on both the action gameplay and event resolution.  A strong character can swing heavier weapons without getting tired or win a ""pose-off"" when meeting apocalyptic body-builders.  A character with a good Medical skill will automatically heal wounds without wasting supplies.  A paranoid character will have special options to anticipate trouble but reduced morale, making it hard to keep them going on the Death Road.  And of course a character with the ""Irritating"" trait will have dialogue choices available to make any bad situation worse.There are no numbers on these stats, just a color coded system to ballpark your abilities at a glance ... without ever knowing for sure exactly what they mean.  There is no ""levelling up""; instead, stats can be improved through use during events, or crippled through bad decisions.  Build up your team directly through gameplay, not by optimizing number stacks on a spreadsheet.* Comedy!  You'll either love it or you won't.  If driving an ice cream truck through a horde of zombies, fighting alongside the real Santa Claus, ""pumping up"" until you're ""too swole to control"", renting out a witch's black cat, or arguing about who farted in the car doesn't tickle you, this may not be your game.  I love it all.  The tone never disappoints and is consistent throughout, weirdly giving the setting a solid, well-established feel despite its ""anything goes"" ethos.So buy this game, good luck on the Death Road, and if you're thinking of downvoting my review you better COOL IT.

But the updates so far have been very encouraging, so if you can get over some unfair deaths and losses and just look forward to trying new stuff on the next run, I can't recommend this enough.			"

												Haven't yet gotten to Canada but have had loads of fun every new game. I love making my own characters so it feels like I'm actually surviving the apocolypse with my friends. The controls are a little hard to get used to and there isn't a controls page that I've found but they are simple enough to get on your own. Also they are a little awkard since I am used to WASD and moving my character with the other hand. I don't know how to use the local co op so if someone could help me out on that I would really appreciate it.			"

												Started with 2 people 1 a mechanic the other a doctor, killed tons of zombies, along the way I picked up some creepy dog thing in a trench coat, zombies sieged us doggie died already, the rest survived the siege, we sped away in our hatchback.Things started getting rough, everyone was injured and the doctor kept starting fights. My mechanic saw a sasquatch on the side of the road, we turned around the car to investigate, the mechanic took a picture of the sasquatch tracks and became happy again. We saw a nice hotel on the road, the creepy lady wouldn't let us in. So we kept driving, sieged by zombies again, it was at this point where we decided we had enough, we ditched the car and gave up on our journey to canada.R.I.P. Creepy trench coat dog thingIn another storyI started off with 2 dog lovers one irritating one calm They were doing well on their fantastic journey they started to run out of gas the one based off my friend decided to siphon gas, he wound up accidentily drinking some gas and getting sick. We visited a camp of traders My friend told one of the traders anime isnt real, the trade got mad at us and made us leave. A recruit showed up on the road, my friend told her to cool it and called her a nerd, she got mad and left. A corgi named kim showed up at the side of the road and joined our crew. Bandits stopped us My friend told them to cool it, he got shanked and died. We had lost our car the corgi and my last survivor, Ivan found a car lot and explored it. Ivan died almost instantly. The corgi sprinted through the car lot, jumped in a police car, started it, and sped away. The game ended just there as the corgi couldnt drive (butsomehowcouldstartacarandspeedaway).Never forget that corgi I hope they are having fun in canada.			"

												This game has already brought me so much fun !First off, the soundtrack :It may not be the one you'd expect from a game depicting the fall of society and travelling in a deadly environment where you can die any day.It's more one of an action-packed loot-and-run, inexplicable event-riddled road trip between friends (or are they?) soundtrack, holding a lot of energy and generally transmitting that ""Let's freaking do it"" vibe. I love it, and like listening to it outside of the game from time to time. You can also access it easily in the game files.The graphics :I personally like a lot good pixel art, and this one is truly good ! I don't really know what i could add, plus you can easily see for yourself. Pixels done right.The gameplay :Movements are fluid, there are a good choice of ways to deal with the zombies when it comes to the action part of the game, such as the classic melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, rifles. You can also sometimes manage to find molotovs, pipe bombs, grenades etc... Moreover, some characters have specific ways to (or not to!) deal with  zombies and get all that sweet loot.Your ai teammates, if you choose to take any with you during looting missions are good at following you around, managing their stamina (as in not killing non threatening zombies) and shouldnt die stupidly too often.The only issues i've encountered yet are some with the depths, for example when you think a zombie is farther than you vertically than it really is, and also sometimes walls ""hitboxes"" taking melee hits instead of zombies.In the other part of the game, wich is managing your road trip across zombinated states toward canada, you are faced with events and a couple of choices. Theses can range to bandit attacks, zombie sieges, picking your looting location, recruiting or not the random survivors you come across along the road, and much more.This is in my opinion the hardest part of the game, as i've lost more good men to bandits and unfortunate events than zombies, but it's not frustrating at all. You can generally move along without too much damage if your group doesnt have someone able to deal with the situation, and it generally rewards good thinking, instead of having randomly generated outcomes which you don't have control of. To summarize, choices are not always easy, but it's not frustrating either.There is also a possibility of local coop, but having not tested it I cannot say if it's good or bad, though I'd say having that possibility is a nice plus !Replayability :I absolutely guarantee you won't see everyting there is to see in your first playthrough. You most likely won't win it either. There is a lot of elements, characters, items and events to discover, and also a few gamemodes available from the start. Custom characters are a nice addition, and the perks available are progressively upgraded as you play the game. Don't think they are useless from the start either.I have yet to play the game more, but at roughly 5 hours of play I did not get bored of it for a second, so I'd say the game does have a lot of hours of fun ahead for you.Overall one of the most fun ""little"" games i've played in a long time. The gameplay, immersion, music are all very good and the humor make this game unique and lovable.			"

												Death Road to Canada is an amazing game where you attempt to take a car full of jerks to the Canadian border so they can live out their blissful existence free from the American zombies. Along the way, you'll find talking dogs, kawaii Anime girls, and a buttload of other crazy characters that make the game ridiculously entertaining. There is a lot of replay value and though I haven't tried co-op yet, that seems quite entertaining as well. I'd like to include an anecdote, but instead I'll just list a few things that have happened to me in this game in the few hours I've played it:[SOME SPOILERS]-Had a character possesed by a Demon-Met an Alien who helped us blast through undead-Had a character die because they attempted to pull out a loose tooth-Had a moose chuckle at my characters, then kill them-Told too many people to ""cool it""-Opened way too many toilets, expecting too much each time-Had my dreams of reaching Canada destroyed before my eyes I've yet to reach Canada (my most recent playthrough was my closest, with my Demon-Possesed Debutante reaching the final mission before becoming zombie chow) so it is challenging but after a brief break, I always return to the game, telling myself that I will make it ""this time.""EDIT: After 14 hours, I finally made it to Canada with my custom character (Hank) and a whole lotta luck.8/10 Recommended.

												This game takes me back to 2nd grade playing the Oregon Trail ... if zombies had been as popular then as they are now!  Silly, yet surprising difficult, the journey from Florida to Canada is frought with a variety of random events. From cars breaking down, surprised bandit attacks, zombie sieges - the game never lets you get too comfortable.  I will say that the difficulty definitely follows an ever increasing pattern. I have consistently struggled/lost the last of my party around the same time when I hit a particular string of bad luck and/or a really bad siege.I can't be upset though - what other game lets you have a horse as a party member (poor thing was incredibly useless and it was very unfair to it that it was my last remaining party member and all it could do was NEIGH as it died) or blow up a truck of Twinkies (who knew they were explosive - though I always suspected it).If you want a quick play with lots of humor and zombies, I'd highly recommend it!

												Essentially a more interactive version of The Oregon Trail. Buy only, and I mean ONLY if you are okay with RNG heavily impacting your experience. it's a pretty fun game full of some hilarious scenarios. Certainly fun but not for everyone, as it can lead to frusteration and annoyance easily.-/+ I'd say it's 75% luck and 25% skill. You shouldn't go into this game expecting to have control over your experience. Some people have over 30 hours on this game and haven't beat it once while others have less than 4 and have beat it multiple times. No matter how much ""skill"" you claim to have, it doesn't matter. This game is hit or miss in terms of winning. You get a lucky run or you don't.- The AI is fairly stupid, as they will constantly get themselves killed by doing stupid things (one of my followers got us killed by shooting a propane tank point-blank.) They will constantly get themselves trapped and die in easily avoidable situations. I found it less maddening to start the game without a companion, but sometimes the game forces you with one anyways. Even though companions drain your resources and drive you insane, there is no way to force them to leave your party unless they die during missions or become replaced.+ The characters and situations you get into on this game are quite funny. My party has had more harm done to them by insects than actual zombies. I was attacked by bees and ants many times. I'd also like to note that I've run into a witch, an anime girl that became so overcome by her own kawaii nature that she imploded into a disgusting monster that was barely recognizable as the little girl she once was. I found myself laughing at a lot that this game had to offer.+ Gameplay during missions is fun and simple. There are load of weapons to use, from simple branches to flamethrowers, that are quite satisfying to use against the undead hordes. There is also a great variety of situation types, such as siphoning gas from junkyards or saving a dog from a zombie-ridden apartment. Quite fun.It's not perfect, and it certainly is not for everyone, but it is worth a try for those who are fans of these types of games. I personally don't like it too much, but I can see why some people would. It's definately unique and offers a lot for the price.			"

												I've come to like Death Road to Canada, its a neat little indie title that has had some thought put into it.  Its a nice twist on an old concept, I'd honestly say that it plays similar to faster than light, only instead of aliens you have to fight zombies. Death Road requires inventory and resource management, some on the fly environmental awareness and deciding whether or not you have the resources to recruit additional members to your group of happy, hopeful survivors. Speaking of recruitable members, you can come across a wide variety of survivors, ranging from your run of the mill pistol and crowbar toting survivor, to a Jason Vorhees lookalike and a magical anime girl, you can even recruit the occasional dog into your group. The game also has quite a few random encounters which can put your group members skills to the test. you may have to pass charisma or strenght checks or perhaps a more in depth shooting or medical skill check. The game has a quirky sense of humor that isn't for everyone, personally I find some of the jokes a little hit and miss. The game is a little pricey for what it is, with other indie titles of a similar style going for much less, would recommend waiting until Christmas or Summer when this will probably go on sale.Positives >Wide variety of weapons to choose from>Suprisingly good character customisation >Wide range of skills for your character >A decent assortment of vehicles to find and use in your trek to Canada >The randomly generated style of play can provide a decent challenge >The humor is pretty good in places >Soundtrack included in the game's files >A pixel art style that has had some effort put into it Negatives >For those who have grown tired of pixel art, this may not be for you>RNG can make the game punishingly difficult >Sometimes the game provides you with little supplies on the early stages, amplifying the difficulty later on>Zombie encounters are sometimes too few and far between, sometimes they occur too often>Priced a little high for what is essentially a rather basic game (Honestly, Hotline Miami cost less than this)Finally, I'll go on record by saying that this is perhaps the only game i've played so far where a character can be killed by stubbing their toe on a rock.

												-has no room in car--looks at pug--looks at boyfriend-This game is full of difficult choices. Haven't been addicted to a zombie survival game like this since Organ Trail, and while that game is very dear to me...dare I say it, DRTC does it better. It's a beautiful little game. Lots of features and options, sky high replayability and very responsive devs who are STILL working on adding cool features and tweaking the game make this an excellent purchase. I didn't wait for it to come on sale, and feel zero regrets about it. In terms of difficulty it is quite punishing. But the journey is enjoyable enough that even when its infuriating, I feel compelled to dive back in. This is an absolute treat. "

There's many things about this game that just keep making making me tell myself ""one more try"" even after I've been playing it for hours. So far the only bug I've seen is when you get through a tiny space and your teamates will make an entire circle around the object so that they can get to you, that got my teamates killed many, many times.One of my best runs so far, was with a guy named Dik, I gave him Megabuff and Warrior and tried to make him look like a biker. He had basically become a zombie master, with almost all abilities maxed out. I was 1 day from Canada, had more than 60 food and died to a molotov I threw at a group of zombies during a siege. My dog was the only one left, and even though he survived the siege, I hadn't teached him to drive a car, so I ended up losing and starting over. But I couldn't be mad at the game, because it was my fault.Now, onto the pros and cons.PROS:+Randomly generated maps, survivors and personalities.+Random events (I once got my character possessed by a demon)+Zombies get more aggressive the more time you spend on a mission+YOU CAN THROW FURNITURE AROUND!+The game has a good sense of humour+Decent amout of skills and perks to choose from, and you can level up your skills+Teamates who are actually smart about weapon choice. For example, if your follower is using a melee weapon but gets tired and is carrying a ranged weapon, it will change to the ranged weapon until it has enough stamina back. It will also pick up weapons on the ground when it has none left.CONS:-Not many customization options, females get more than males-The follower's pathfinding sometimes bugs out-Sometimes if there's a weapon on the floor, your teamate will keep changing his weapons continuously until you move away from it-Only local co-op.All in all, i'd give this game a solid 9/10. I really love this game and hope to see it getting some new updates soon "

												I just came out of my best run at this game yet. Me and my motley crew had a hybrid which took us up to 7 days out from Canada. Sadly we broke down and while walking in the woods we stumbled across an alien. And his alien car! With the promise of getting this car after the seige we fought. My team scraped through and once we had been told how to open the car we fought through uncountable waves of undead to reach this strange, grey vehicle. We leapt in and slammed the doors, revving the engine, preparing to shoot off into the sunset. Then the car exploded and we both died. This game is amazing. The style is really fun, the music is quirky and charming and the humor is on point. Definately worth the £10!			"

												9/10Most entertaining rouge like game I've ever played.Funny and rewarding. Coop is ok, just some levels aren't meant for it, but overall it's a perfect couch game. The game feels complete but the release doesn't quite fit. I don't see why this doesn't have achievements or cards. Character creation could use some more options and there could be more skills/skill levels, but that all really can only subtract 1 point. At worst, it's 8 out of 10 for the music being too loud and repetitive. Still, this game is a must have if you are into a challenge or rouge likes or zombies or coop.			"

												For me, the thing that really makes this game fun is putting friends and family into the game and watching the chaos that ensues.  The game plays a bit like Oregon Trail in terms of managing resources like food and bullets while traveling across the country.  You also have to make decisions about how to handle various situations that come up, like running into a massive group of zombies and having to decide whether to take a detour or try to plow through them.  Depending on the traits of your characters, you may have additional options in these instances.  The other half of the game is running around city streets and various buildings searching for supplies while avoiding getting killed by zombies.  The combat can feel a little clunky, particularly when dealing with doors and corners, but doesn't detract from the game too much.  Character movement also feels a little flawed.  Navigating corners and narrow spaces can get a bit frustrating when your character seemingly gets stuck on nothing.  I also found the companion AI to be a bit annoying at times.  Their path-finding can be frustrating, they will often continue to walk into objects instead of just walking around them.This game really shines in it's character design, decision making, and quirky humor.  You're able to give your characters a perk, like mechanical or medical skills, and personality trait, like being calm under fire or paranoid.  It creates humorous situations like when your co-worker complains about Mondays the whole trip, or when your fitness obsessed friend challenges bandits to a body builder pose-off.  Overall I found this game to be a very enjoyable experience.  I would recommend this game to people who enjoy replaying games to see all the different outcomes to different decisions you make.  If your goal is to just get through the game to see the end, there may not be enough value here for you.  Otherwise, there's enough content to warrent playing the game multiple times, even after finshing it.			"

												Great couch co-op games have become increasingly hard to find. This is one of the good ones. Lots of replayability because of the different characters you can recruit, and all the random locations keep things interesting. In addition, there are lots of laugh-out-loud moments when people are talking in the car, or using their abilities to change how some of the situations go that you find yourself in. There have been heartbreaking moments where you found that one special character, only to have them get eaten a day or two before making it to Canada. My wife and I plan on sinking many more hours into this game.			"

												This earns a seat next other magnificent indie retro games like ""Party Hard"" and ""Rouge Legacy"". But in a lot of ways this is technically better then both. Having multiple modes to choose from to fit your play style or your time frame and even for your experience. Adding in a reasonable character customization that can tailor your leader/potential traveling company personality and look. You can make any one from a basic solder to a YouTube celebrity like Jim Sterling. The coolest feature is one that we are starting to see less and less of in the AAA gaming industry, couch co-op. My only gripe is that it could use some mod support for players to add to this already incredible game.I play consoles more often than not. But when I get that retro, nostalgia itch or an experience that I just can’t find on consoles, I go to steam. And my goodness this's a treasure. I give this a 9/10.A most have on Steam.			"

												Ton'o'fun, really dig this game. It's a unique setup. It's sort of like Oregon / Organ Trail mixed with a lot of map encounters where you and your dudes (up to 2 local players, 4 in your team) have to avoid getting eaten by zombies when hunting for supplies. There is a good dose of randomness and it's hard and its fun.  There are a ton of positives and not that many negatives and it's a fair price.  And the dev seems to be from the 'update tons of ****' all the time' camp, which is a great reason to support the game. No reservations about recommending it. You'll know from a gameplay video if it is for you or not, I think it's great myself.			"

												   Death Road to Canada is a phenomenal mix of all the zombie games you have played before with Oregon Trail which makes for the most fun zombie apocalypse game in years if ever. This game strips down all of the slower moving aspects of zombie survival into a concise and streamlined re-playable experience.    The player controls randomly generated or self-generated characters on a romp from Florida to Canada in hopes to find safe haven. Along the way, resources must be scavenged, zombies must be crushed, allies need to be rescued or recruited, and hope to god the car doesn’t break down along the way.Strengths:•	The gameplay is just pure fun. Fast and Frantic with a bit of strategic maneuvering required when things get really hairy.•	The RPG elements bring personality to each of the characters, and each specialization feels powerful enough to warrant a diverse group of zombie survivors. Just be sure to keep everyone as happy as possible or they might leave at the worst possible moment!•	The random events are both funny and enjoyable, with a bit of rage inducing as well to keep things nice and balanced towards a harder difficulty.•	Local co-op makes for a great addition, but what is even better, playing alone is just as fun. The AI allies are not just mindless drones, they will loot, replace their weapons and crack zombie skulls with precision.•	The production values are extremely high, visuals are top notch, music is fantastic, and the UX is streamlined and easy to navigate and use. The game also tends to throw useful events your way if you happen to be SOL in a particular resource.Weaknesses:•	The lack of an online or four player option makes me a sad panda.•	The pendulum of “Doing Well” to “Dead Meat” can swing extremely quickly. One moment you are doing fine, and the next day you are left with nothing because the car broke down.Overall Death Road to Canada is the survival game I didn’t even know I needed in my life. Sometimes after playing hundreds of hours in Project Zomboid or State of Decay, it is nice to just have a bit of fun smashing zombies, collecting loots, and driving towards the Maple Leaf State. I see myself playing this game for months in hopes to unlock all of the different modes and characters, easily the best fifteen dollars spent in a long while.

												So you think you can make it to Canada eh? Think you're high and mighty, capable of waltzing through the undead hordes with both skill and style? Well how about you COOL IT! and take a seat right there, cause getting to Canada ain't no picnic!I've tried reaching Canada several times now; some tries more successful than others. From times where there was plenty of food, but where health slowly ticked away after every encounter. To times where I had plenty of health yet my group slowly died of hunger.No this ain't Canada, it's the US of A; where the zombie virus affect both man and machine. Because cars seem to fail after ten miles and aluminum bats SNAP! at the speed of sound. As if God himself stacked the odds against you! And I'm not even mentioning the SIEGE!s.Don't be fooled, this is a hard game, and when you play it long enough you will become familiar with these two words: Dang it!Pros:-Highly enjoyable if you have a slightly wacky (and maybe even macabre) sense of humor.-Plain old enjoyable if you don't.-Quite hard, (though at times luck based.)-Very active devs, seriously. (As of writing; working actively to fix some bugs that snuck in release)Cons:-(Quite hard, though) at times luck based.-Some weaponry breaks way too fast/randomly. In one of my new games; a character broke their starting weapon after one hit.In short:Personally love it; would get into a car made of aluminum foil, tell random people to COOL IT!, and get eaten while trying to drive to Canada again.

 Follow the Death Road Death Road to Canada is one of those games where you cant stop playing it, almost like going out to a restaruant you really enjoy... but instead of eating food to appeal your appetite you're playing a videogame. I first heard of this game when a YouTuber by the name of PBGGameplay made a halloween themed video about this game, and instantly I knew this was the game for me. The music is amazing and is the exact opposite of what I think a zombie game would have, it reminds me of an old super nintendo TMNT beat-em-up (the best kind of beat-em-up). The gameplay is fun and rewarding, you feel pretty good once you beat a super hard siege or come back from a location with more loot then normal you feel really good and confident. The re-playability is amazing and the different game modes and outcomes for events on the road like the UFO landing sight add so much content  and if you keep the alien alive till the end of the siege you get the UFO as a car . In the end  Death Road to Canada   is my favorite game of 2016, and definitely one of my favorite games of all time. Onward to canada! "

												Incredibly funny.Incredibly challenging.Incredibly well done.A very in-depth zombie survival game with LOTS of content and never the same experience twice.One of the best rogue-likes I think on Steam right now.Everyone should honestly give this game a shot. I've been a fan of this developer for years since they released Punch Quest (which this game heavily references with its humour). This game has been in the works for years, and it really really shows. I think the icing on the cake is being able to make your own characters, NPC's, and go on an adventure with all of them to escape the zombie hoards. *UPDATE FROM ORIGINAL*The updates to this game have been INCREDIBLE and they keep getting better. This game just continues to constantly improve and blow me away with what they're doing with it. Easily one of my favorite purchases on Steam and always a fun game to come back to.			"

Recruit Cesar Milan the dogwhisperer, and he's a swell guy, frequently boosting group morale and talking his way out of situations. We don't encounter any dogs after recruiting him. Then, things get messy during an escape and he gets grabbed by a hoarde as the car pulls away... The very next day we find a pet shop filled with non-hostile feral dogs and their treasure trove of bones. Could have had a squad of dogs trained by Cesar Milan, instead there was just tragedy and woe.Thus is life on the Death Road to Canada....			"

												I love this game to death. It's the certain difficulty where you could play for hours and still beat it, yet, not rage inducing.HoweverThis game has many and numerous glitches. Some simply annoying, like seeing the backside of your characters when meeting them on the road. Some make it difficult to even plan, like having only the leader's inventory visible even though I have a full party. And some just make me lose faith in the game, like how the game just freezes and I have to force reset my computer.3/5 For now because of the numerous glitches strewn across the game. But if you guys were to just polish it a bit, I'd give it 5/5! AMAZING GAME!!!			"

Death Road to Canada is about surviving the zombie apocalypse and escaping to Canada, whilst managing a car full of jerks. It's full of references and lots of hilarious events, like telling people to ""COOL IT"" and recruiting a man in a cat suit dressed like Garfield. It full of laughs and is great to play with friends, as well as discuss. With the many characters, events and gamemodes offered by this game, it's full of replay value and can be played for hours on end without the player getting bored. I wholeheartedly believe this game deserves an award.			"

												Great, somewhat random, but not, an exercise in patience with destiny as things happen over which you have very limited control, but are interesting to see happen.  Happily, it's interspersed with things over which you -do- have control (killing zombies in a continually cute and crunchy way).Have played at least 10 runs without reaching the fabled Eden of Canada, and will play at least 5 more.

												A rouge with survival elements with a splash of internet humor. The game presents itself in two different play-styles: an Oregan Trail like decision making rpg overworld, and a Nuclear Throne like top down fighter where you scavenge for supplies and weapons. There is also a character customisation where you can design your own characters and give them particular traits to spice up the character, or you can find randomly generated characters to adenture with, topped with some preset special characters that have unique dialog, abilities and weapons. All of this is presented in beautiful and detailed pixel art.I only have two gripes with DR2C,-Its difficulty if the first. While I understand that it is a rougelike and your chances of winning consistantly without a high level of practice are very low. This game also heavily relies on good RNG on your characters stats and the events they are put in; which may turn people off. Generally I find there are two ways you can play DR2C, you either play silly in order to have fun, often resulting in bad things happening due to you telling everyone to ""COOL IT"", or you can play super optimally and boring, usually resulting in higher chances of victory but takes away some charm the game has.-The second is the small amount of bugs the game has. So far my game is unable to enter fullscreen and just makes the screen black, which I assume is a resolution issue. The other problem that has only happened once is the game randomly crashing presenting you with an error code. However, being a newly released game with updates coming out every day, these problems are sure to be fixed if not shortly, in the future.Overall DR2C is a great pick up game with runs lasting around 30-60 minutes, packed full with hilarious dialog and a vast array of characters. Good times will be had with this game, but if RNG reliant games bug you, you might want to wait till this title is on sale. If not, I highly recommend it!			"

												Most fun I've had in multiplayer for a while! Currently my only complaint is that second player loses control of their character to the computer every time you enter or exit a building. Fix that and I'd call it a perfect and fun awful experience!That aside, some of my most fun adventures include being repeatedly kicked by moose, that time I was betrayed by a very unloyal dog and murdered in my sleep, the time my unloyal dog flipped out and attempted to rob a trader and was subsequently murdered...I could go on., but I'll save some of the random event surprises for people to experience on their own. And remember, losing is fun--if you can't agree with that statement and NEED to win, maybe this game isn't for you...			"

												Death Road to Canada was one of the first game I ever Kickstarter - and the first to come to fruition and come out as a playable game. That said, this is a fantastic game that well exceeded my expectations for what it could become 3 years ago.Death Road to Canada is essentially a mix of Organ Trail (and not Oregon Trail, though more on that in a bit) and Procedural Generation. The focus of the game has you essentially driving in a vehicle towards the border to Canada from Florida, building up your party (of jerks) abilities as well as gathering weapons and supplies as you proceed along the Death Road. A lot of the action for this game comes from when you stop the your vehicle to get out - scavenging for supplies, rescuing potentially new jerks to recruits, dealing with traders and bandits, and surviving zombie sieges.Now, I mentioned Organ trail (and by extension Oregon Trail). For those who don't know what those games are (because this game very much based on how they work) - this is essentially a vehicle traveling game where you make decisions as they randomly come up on your journey. As you drive along you'll decide what areas you will scavenge in from a list of choices or how you might deal with a bandit blockade that you come across. There are mini-action instances in Organ Trail and Oregon Trail where you hop out of your vehicle; similar to this game though here they make up the core of the game play.Essentially, where a lot of the play will be at in this game is walking around as a party gathering supplies, weapons, and new party members. You control one of the characters, and you can switch control  to any of the characters in your party that are in close proximity to the one you are controlling. The others will be AI controlled (or controlled by another player on Local Coop). Depending on the situation, there may be sparse few zombies or zombies raining from the ceiling and clawing their way up through the ground. Depending on the time of day the zombies may be more passive or more aggressive.Probably most notably is that decision making is really what this game is all about. Maybe you see a horde of zombies in front of you and you need to make the decision to take a detour or to drive right through them (damaging your car). Maybe while scavenging and there is one more building to raid, but it is nearing nighttime and you have injured party members along with whatever loot you have already found.I well recommend this game and consider it a generally good play - likely even better if you can play it in Local Coop.

												Y'ALL BEST DROP FIFTEEN SPARE BUCKS ON THIS GAME IF YA KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YA.Okay, southern accent aside [blame my upbringing], great af game. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to try and beat [throw in some dysentery and you have another Oregon Trail with zombies], but it's still fun. Granted, I grew up in the 90's/00's, not the 80's [this game's aesthetics], but in all honesty, the soundtrack will catch anyone's interest. Hell, just watch the trailer- it capture's the game's style PERFECTLY.And the gameplay? Ohoho, the gameplay. You want all these zombies dead? Use weapons. Oh no, one of your party members wound up tired from a random encounter event! Time to let them sleep in the car! Oh no, now that you don't have your full party out looting, there're all these cool weapons lying around! Oh WOW! Is that a ninja?! Let's drop some food at her feet and recruit her! Ooh cool, it's Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson [the last bodybuilder]! Let's get fitness tips from him! What?! The ninja disappeared- but we can teleport with those smoke bombs she left behind!This is all from a single playthrough of this game. I died on the last stretch as Papyrus from Undertale, having started out with Eggman and Metal Sonic from the Sonic franchise.And for that matter, custom characters. You want to fight zombies as yourself? Well, here's as close as you'll get! Want a crossover of this and another popular game like Overwatch? Click that custom characters button [Starbound is also great for this, by the way].tl;dr, this game's definitely worth its price. Only problem I have ewith it is that Starbound's been pulling more of my attention lately, haha.			"

												It started out as an adventure of my friend, Nic, and I to Canada. We've known each other since we were small. Together we survived some pretty prickly situations and we met a few friends along the way, Rusty and Jacinda. We were a rag tag group of survivors content on the idea of making it to Canada. Things were looking great but unfortunately that didn't last long. We had lost our car and were forced to trek on foot. After what seemed to be an eternity, we spotted a cabin and a van that resembled a dog. After fighting through the horde of zombies, we managed to find the keys. We struggled to make it back to the van, but we were on our way to Canada once again!We all were in need of rest after the all the excitement we had endured during the day so we had found an empty house along the roadside. Night was falling upon us, as leader, I appointed Jacinda to barricade duty. This was a fatal decision on my part as leader. I may not have been perfect but I always seemed to keep us on top. Night had fallen and we were surrounded by zombies. With Jacinda's lackluster job, they had been able to break in and we had lost Nic and Rusty. Jacinda and I had narrowly escaped with our lives. Bitter towards Jacinda, I knew ultimately it was my decision which had led to the death of my childhood friend, Nic, and our beloved teammate, Rusty. Even after these events, we couldn't forget our initial goal of this journey. It was to make it to Canada. The sacrifice of our friend's could not be in vain. Once again, we pushed on.Low on supplies and down to just the two of us, we decided to enter a nearby town to gear up. The rain helped muffle our sounds enough to push past the large packs of angry and aggressive zombies. We found a house with enough supplies to last us the remainder of our trip. Now we just needed to get back to our van.On our way out the door, we noticed the large packs had moved to the outside of the house we were in, and sadly, we were spotted. We had tried to stand our ground, but were quickly overwhelmed and were forced to run. Making a mad dash to our van, we had gotten ourselves surrounded. It was in that moment that Jacinda had taken her hatchet and started fighting and pushing her way through one side. Myself and a bloody and beaten Jacinda had managed to make it to the doorway of a small house. She was bitten all over and we both knew that it was over for her. She told me to go inside without her. She said she was sorry but this is where her story ends. Reluctantly, I turned and closed the door.Here I sit in this small house, alone and waiting for my impending doom while I write this letter. Moans and sounds of limbs banging against the door. I feel at peace.10/10 Simulator for when 'murica falls because of the Trumpster. Would die travelling to Canada again.			"

												Let's be honest, zombie games are overdone. The genre is congested with stale, uninspired, boring and pointlessly challenging games that make this over saturated part of the market even more and more irrelevant.  But this game, with its goofy atmosphere, upbeat music  and charming art style, is breathing new life into this undead genre.Death Road to Canada is an easy game to pick up, an easy one to learn, but even harder to put down. The rogue-like adventure/survival aspects make every play through of this game different and interesting. And with the custom character feature, you are given the power to generate so many more possibilities as you experiment to see who works well with whom.Part of the reason this game is so easy to fall in love with is the culmination of its dorky sense of humor and catchy OST. For some unforeseeable reason, the chiptune music pairs perfectly with a game about blood, guts and survival. And the possibly fatal decisions you are making on the road turn from frustrating to hilarious due to the comical writing. Never before has a fart been the catalyst that led to my character's downfall, and for that reason alone this game deserves an award. I have but two complaints. First is that the RNG can sometimes ruin you. Often you are left with decisions while driving; do you surrender food or fight the bandits? Abandon the car or attempt to fix it? etc, etc. But at times you come to a decision where the solution involves shooting or other skills, and by some cruel twist of fate the character making this decision is the least proficient marksman. And you can't change that. This has never ruined the experience for me, mind you. With these decisions, the game is often fair. All of my failures are my own, not the game's. Save one instance, this is also my second complaint. For some reason, when the AI characters encounter a weapon they already have they get stuck in a perpetual loop of weapon switching. This doesn't happen too often, but when traveling the mall I had two characters of mine get stuck in this loop with umbrellas which resulted in their deaths. This led to a slippery slope which ended in a game over. So beware of that.Ultimately this game is more than worth your time and money. It's fair yet challenging. It's more fun than frustrating. And it's highly addictive. Give it a chance, especially if you love other rogue games like Binding of Isaac and things of that ilk. I'd also like to recommend checking out more of Rocketcat's games. I enjoy playing their mobile games, and I look forward to see what these devs will do in the future.TL;DRGood game. Happy chiptune music. Dog's use crowbars. Farts can be fatal. This game is rife with references to different shows/games/etc. Cat video magazines are a thing in this game and I'm sad that they aren't real. "

												I can't tell you how much I love this game. This game easily became my favorite game of 2016 just because of how great it really is. Death Road To Canada is a special kind of game that uses things we have seen in other games, such as organ trail, but heavily improves on. From making friends and family as survivors, to laugh out loud funny moments, DRTC is well worth the asking price of $15. If you don't have this game, you should get it ASAP. There's something about killing zombies, telling everyone to ""COOL IT"" and fighting bigfoot that really keeps you into it. I love this game and I want to thank the dev for just blessing us with such a treat. DRTC is a must have for just about everyone, and I cannot wait to see how much more will be added on to this already amazing game. 10/10			"

												Death Road to canada, a very hard yet enjoyable game. Hard because of how one second you have a full team where everyone is super good, but then when you get to a trader camp, have no food left, so then you steal some food from a trader, and then the whole camp kills everyone except your weak healer ;-;. Enjoyable because you could come a cross a very free horse man..... who cant wield any wepons so when your whole team dies excpet for him you basically are dead, which goes back to the hard thing XD. but there is a lot of replayability because of how everyone you meat on the road has random stats. There was this one time when i had a dog (o btw the dogs can talk and carry wepons XD) and she found a empty mascot suit that came to life and yelled ""I HATE MONDAYS!"", so then we did anything that a normal human would do, we recruted him to our group. But then things went wrong, one day while we were driving the suit just yell ""I HATE MONDAYS!"" and then he said ""AND TODAY IS A MONDAY"". then he teleported us all into a seige in a random set of woods and 2 of my people died, including my dog ;-;(just kidding it deserved it she was a jerk >:( ). so ya that is how i lost that game. But back to the actual review even with all of this fun stuff that i just talked about there are some cons one being the multiplayer, the second player has to each and everytime you go somewhere select the charrecter they want to play and join the fight which is realy tedious. Secondly the second player cannot go through doors which means, the first player has the infamous main charrecter deseas (but to a lower extent because they can die and the story goes on), this makes going through a house really annoying because the first player has to do everything. All in all this is a great game and i recomend it. And also the naked horse man is the most majestic thing i have seen in my life. :3			"

Dogs with shotguns?Car-throwing body builders?Exploding anime princesses?Party-mudering psychos in hockey masks?If you answerd yes to any of these then you'll DEFINITELY be interested in Death Road To Canada (DRTC)DRTC is an arcadey beat em' up/ shoot-em up zombie survival game with semi-randomised stat building, loot management, random encounters & choices, and hilarious writing. Combat is a little floaty and reminiscent of older SNES beat em ups, and weapons vary from the standard (fists/paws, tools, kitchenwares, sporting goods, bladed weapons, guns, etc.) to the crazy (bigass shotguns, miniguns, wizard staff,  airhorns, mjollnir, etc) and each his vary levels of attack and energy cost. Every playthrough is unique and you'll find different characters, weapons, cars and locations every playthrough.The only downside I can see is the sub-par follower AI. Followers can be set to Attack, Defend, or Running and while the AI does a great job at keeping them useful and alive, they occasionally bite off more than they can deal with.  "

												-it was an average day. or so i thought.-zombies invaded our town so i knew i had to escape to a place with no zombies, canada.-i took a long a buddy named greg with me to canada. greg was a great  mechanic and doctor so i knew he'd be  perfect-all was going well, we looted several places, stocked up on food, gas, and medical equipment-along the road i spotted a dog. i recruited the dog, raliegh, to the team as we had more then enough food-raleigh was extremely trustworthy and we used him to bride bandits and what not-we continue our trek to canada, fending off hordes of zombies whilst collecting loots-we then met peter on the side of the street alone-knowing we had alot of food we thought another person wouldnt hurt us-hes a fighter, lets recruit him they said-look how big he is they said-he'll be perfect they said-so we allowed peter to join even though i really did not want to-none the less he was a fighter and a warrior, and he really helped out the team-or so we thought-i began to get excited, as we had plenty of supplies and only 4 days left-i began to trsut peter, and knowing he was a good shot, i gave him a gun-and that was all good-but what happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life-we ran into a town, and in a house the was a grenade-at the time i had never used a grenade, so  igave it to peter-and that was the worst mistake of my life-the next time we encountered a horde, and just as it looked like we deafeted it, we had not-peter, who i had begun to trust had turned sides, a traitor as some may say-he threw the grenade right at all of our feet-he had instantly killed himself and greg, and severly injured me and raleigh-flashbacks began to cross my mind of my vietnam days-me and raleigh believed petercould have been apart of isis-as we sit there half dead the zombies began to enclosure us-me and raleigh could not escapeand had died10/10 would trust an isis member again*not meant too offend anyone*			"

												This is based off of a true story.Everything was fine. Kiara, Rosaline, and their dog, Billy, were cruising down the Death Road to Canada. They had over 200 gas, over 30 food, 20 medical kits, and more ammo and weapons than they know what to do with. They were a happy family, eating marshmallows and telling scary stories around the fire.Then... everything changed when the group of bandits attacked.Kiara was killed. But that wasn't the worst part. The dog was killed. Sweet little Billy. Struck down in his prime. Rosaline was all alone.So she traveled on. The car broke down. She walked alone, through the rain. She didn't have time to mourn the lost of her dearest friends... her only friends. Then, when all hope was gone, while looting an apartment, Rosaline found a dog, Jeanette. She adopted Jeanette and they traveled onwards.The two comrades happened upon a junkyard that had a decent car. At the junkyard was another dog that joined them in their new car. Jeanin was one of them now. Their family was growing. They were all smiles and laughs. Jeanette loved to stick her fluffy doggy head out the window.And another dog, Virginia, found them on the road and joined them! Rosalin was surrounded by sweet, loving, zombie-killing dogs. What more could she ask for?But one apartment... there were too many zombies. Rosalin was seperated from her beloved dog. She slashed at the rotting zombies with her rusty machete but she was too tired. Her arms went limp at her side as she felt teeth rip into her flesh. She looked at Jeanette one last time... her last breath was a single, whispering word:""Canada.""The fluffy little dog gathered up her friends, her comrades, her family, and fled the apartment, leaving behind the skeleton of her beloved master. With that one word echoing in her mind, Jeanette jumped in the front seat of the car and taught herself to drive. They were going to get to Canada.The three dogs fought and fought for over a week. They battled their ways through sieges, through swarms, through factories, through grocery stores, through the skeletons of the hundreds of humans who had died in their journey to Canada. So many had died. But these little dogs were making it.They were less than two days away. They stopped at a trading camp one last time. The traders took pity on the three dogs and gave them some free ammo. The dogs were eterneally grateful.But Rosalin had had all the guns.The dogs didn't have any guns.One last stop before reaching Canada.They were trapped in a house.It was a siege. They just had to survive long enough and then escape.Zomies were raining from the ceilings, flooding through the door as a flood of death and gore. No other human had ever gotten this far before. Not even close. But these dogs. These brave dogs, Jeanette, Jeanin, Virginia... they had done what no other human had done. They had gotten to Canada.Almost.Jeanette was the first to die as she desperately tried to lead the pack of zombies away from her comrades and from the door which would soon be open. But the house was too small. She was overwhelmed.Jeanin took over. Sweet little Virginia was being overwhelmed. Jeanin ran in, batting the zombie away, scratching and biting them to protect Virginia, who was quickly becoming tired. Jeanin succeeded in her goal, but only after she died.Virginia. She was all alone. The zombies were busy feasting upon the carcasses of Jeanette and Jeanin. Virginia ran towards the door. The siege wasn't over but it was almost time for that blessed door to be free. She would be ready.But the zombies were far more ready than she was.They were waiting right outside the door and came rushing in to greet her. Virginia fought her way to the door and tried to leave.""It is unsafe to go outside right now.""She couldn't leave. Not yet. She tried to run away. She fought and fought and fought... but it was all for naught. She was less than a foot away from the exit.The zombies circled her and Virginia's body fell to the floor as they bit and scratched her. Her blood was ripped out from her veins and her limbs were devoured by the growling mass of zombies. As her soul slowly left her eyes, she could see one last sign...""The siege is over. It's safe to go outside.""One day away.One driving day away from Canada.Almost.10/10 would get a pack of dogs to drive a car to Canada again.			"

												Amazing game! Great gameplay, old-school graphics, good music, and funny humor. The only thing I would add would be to make your own dogs. I love playing the Familiar Characters mode, but it's disappointing that I can't create my own dog. Good human character creator, though! :)			"

												Death Road to Canada is an absolutely adorable rouge-like game, despite the amount of spewing guts, bones and limbs flying everywhere around.Imagine for a second Faster Than Light fused with Project Zomboid, plus ridiculous amount of cute humor. Nothing vulgar or dark. Biggest insult you'll encounter in this game is Dingus (and even that is not an insult :p).There's almost not a single conversation in-game that didn't give me a little smile. Combat, and the whole game itself, is simple, minimalistic, non complex at all and still manages to be so addictive and amazing.Today many games advertise on ""randomly generated"" marketing, but not as many manage to execute the mechanic well. Death Road to Canada is not bragging about it, yet it has one of the most impressive randomization mechanics I've ever seen in games.When I said it has resemblance to FTL, it's not just about its replayability, but also the perfectly short campaign.Games with replay value should be exactly like that. Short and interesting, and not have 1000s of hours per playthrough. My shortest (successful) playthorugh on normal difficulty was approximately 1.5 hours. I am yet to do the longer campaign mode, but am already eager to try it out after countless amounts of fails.And speaking of fails, unlike many other rouge-like games, this one does not make you want to smash your keyboard againt the display when you lose. i can't quite explain why. Maybe it's the games general poistivity vibe, maybe it's because things lost are not so hard to gain. Maybe both.And finally for someone like myself who is absolutely into retro games, this one will grab nostalgia by its weakest point. Amazing pixel art combined with great 8-bit soundtrack is a perfect formula to satisfy all the gamers dating way back from times of NES/Sega consoles.Overall amazing. I have absolutely not a single complaint.It's humorous, simple, minimalistic, beautiful and has got great replay value to it.Passing a game like this is like a sin for every self respective gamer, to say the least			"

												PROS-This game is hard which means you cant just beat this game in one try. You'll have to put actually effort to win-Each try depending on how long you live can last from 20min to a couple hours -cant stop playing one of those one more try games-customizable characters making the game more personalized-multiple game modes-tons of weapons and traits-game getting lots of updates-A.I is good enough to not get themselves killed easily-lots of charm-ZOMBIES!!!-fun combat -cant stay in a place too long making you decide whether or not to enter another location for just a little more supply or make that risky decision in events-amazing soundtrack-simple and changeable controls-fun in single player and co-opCONS-cant manage your food and who gets healed (characters will instantly heal a random person and it would be cool if you could decide who gets food)-some events instantly screw you over and you can be pretty far in a run when it happens (bandits mainly)-if you don't want a character to be on your team because your running out of food or their traits aren't useful anymore you cant get rid of them unless they die or you get somebody to replace the characterNEUTRAL-randomized events repeat a lot (more updates are coming soon and different characters have different reactions to events so its neutral)SUMMARYI love this game and I will not stop playing until I beat every game mode and maybe even make challenges for myself. This game has lots of features and charm with more features to come. My only problems are mainly just things I want added to the game or nitpicks I had with the game. I definitely recommend this game.			"

												SInce this game came out I have been playing it for a few hours, I really like the game and I just played three hours or so on this new update it improved quite a bit. Now I love the various encounters with famous people and dogs and even being able to create my own friends and family. I have gotten to the last siege of the game 9 times now and I still havn't gotten past it. But hey all the more challenging I think this is a wonderful game and its a more awesome idea so far I have met Elvis, Jason Voorhees, a bodybuilder type that doesnt seem to have any attacks, an old women that can box, a luchadore, ALOT of diff. dog breeds, I love how th UI is set up and really like the little stats each person has and that you can even upgrade the traits by completing the random things the upgrades tell you to do  and how to get it and what not I really like the music and very catchy even going as far as catching myself humming it every once and awhile. Im so excited to see more of the updates to come out and I really want to see what type of potential this game has.TL:DR-I LOVE DA GAME IT GOOD!			"

												I may not have that many runs in yet but this game is great. My best run so far was when my buddy had dog friend as a perk and kept attracting dogs to the cause. About five days in I felt I was doing well then it happened. A seige completly devasted me killing the two humans in my party. One getting trapped in the horde and the other overcome by the grief of losing his partner charged head first shooting his shotgun as much as possible. All the while my lassy dog fighting with all its heart trying to save who ever was left. It only lasted seconds though the lassy all that remained. Making a getaway just as the horde closed in the dog was all I had left. Then my lassy decided it was time to stick those keys into the ignition and drive. The next day my lassy was mauled by a moose it was trying to help and thus ended my best run. 10/10			"

												I never really got a chance to play Oregon Trail or anything like that.But oh man, if they were THIS addicting, I'm gonna have to make some additions to my collection.The game overall has the look and feel of an 80's thriller, what with its 8-bit visuals, fresh slang, and music that mixes 8-bit chiptune with classic rock.The game is hilarious, as you'll encounter various events randomly like a portal that causes you to emerge as a new person or teaching a dog to drive. Not to mention the game doesn't really take itself seriously, adding to the overall charm of things.It controls quite nicely, too. I had no problems using a Steam controller to loot abandoned buildings, beat the crap out of zombies, and make choices for my party. Did I mention throwing furniture feels natural, too?I especially love the way the game plays out. Events along the way to Canada are randomly generated and always leaving you with a new experience each time you play, and the inclusion of custom characters (meaning you, your friends and family can get eaten alive together) is the cherry on top of the campy sundae that is Death Road.I haven't even reached Canada yet, but I'm not mad. Quite the opposite, really. So few games have me crawling back for more once all is said and done, and this is one of the few.			"

												What can I even say? This is one of my favorite games on Steam. There is endless replayability, which is rare for most games. The unique characters and unique deaths you can suffer are always good for a laugh. Unless it's a dog (I'm sorry Fido. I shouldn't have let you run into the mansion alone with that sledgehammer). If you know how to manage your supplies, then you're good. Just kidding, the game can get pretty rough, even if you know what to do. I can't express my positivity for this game ENOUGH! The developers are still adding more and more content so even players with over 100 hours in this game (ahem) find new things about the game every run. Buy it. Unless you don't like zombies. Or Rogue-Like games. Or Canada. Especially if you don't like Canada.			"

												Everything happened so quickly. Me and my group fell dead in an instant, and it was all my fault.      It started with just me and my brother. We were driving along, with about as much supplies as one would want at the start of their journey. Enough to instill hope for the long and arduous journey ahead. That is until I committed the most horrid Iniquity known to the modern man.      I farted     I looked to my brother and I saw hatred in his eyes. In a panic I did what any strong man within a life or death situation would do. I blamed the other. Reluctantly, my brother accepted it without argument. We both knew I was the culprit, but we were close enough that such a large fault could be overlooked. However, it did put a deal of strain on our relationship.      We traveled further, fighting against the zombie horde. Until I came across my girlfriend, trying in vain to push open a door clearly labeled ""pull"". Me and my brother's morale had been beaten down, we were in dire need of an ally to help push back against the coming darkness. For a moment I contemplated leaving her behind. Her low level of intelligence could prove to be our downfall But, I glanced down to the small stuffed penguin she had given me as a gift. I still kept it around, she always knew I was fond of penguins and risked her life to scavenge one after all the shops had been raided. It seemed strange that people would leave behind such a valuable item in a zombie infested wasteland. It seemed to beg me to take her with us. So we welcomed her to the group and continued on our way to Canada.      Days went by with much success. With her help we had been able to scrounge up enough resources to last us a while. Everything seemed to be looking for us. That was of course, until yet again someone broke wind. For a brief moment we all eyed each other. The friendship and loyalty I once saw gave way to anger and suspicion. Not once, but twice someone had broken the sacred oath to keep that which was meant for the bathroom, in the bathroom. I was not responsible this time, but that would not stop the group from blaming me. Pinning the blame on another would not work this time. Then, a glimmer of hope appeared, I could have my girlfriend attempt to ""deduce"" who had farted. I never thought she was particularly stupid, but if I was correct, I could line up the ""evidence"" to ensure the blame did not fall on me. I could avoid becoming more broken without sacrificing what precious little relationships I had left. I did as planned, and my girlfriend figured out who farted.     Me.     Then I saw something in her eyes. Glee. SHE had been the one who farted. It was HER fault. But I could not argue with her. I had underestimated her, I fell for her trap, and had allowed her to avoid the blame without risk, However, my brother was convinced and the matter was settled. Had she feigned idiocy this entire time? How much of her word could I trust now that I knew she was so willing to blame others for her own farts? I looked down to my sentimental stuffed penguin. How could I trust that this penguin was even a quality store product? It must have been shameful replica designed for the sole purpose of earning my trust. Yes, I could see it now. The eyes were slightly discolored and the head was tilted at an angle. It was a lie.     How long had she been maintaining this facade? Was my brother deceiving me as well? I would not let this stand. I planned to escape the hordes of zombies with the supplies and leave the others to suffer. One could blame another for one's farts, but if one gives another a stuffed penguin that is anything below store quality THAT was inexcusable. Unfortunately, in planning to escape the future horde along with abandoning my group. I inadvertently landed me into a horde that was right in front of us. You’d think a large mass of writhing undead would be hard to miss, but alas my wrath had blinded me.     There was no mercy in that shambling wood cabin. The undead beat down the roof and walls. They broke in from every part that they could. We fought as hard as we could. My girlfriend was the first to fall, then my brother. Both became nothing more than a mass of broken flesh beneath a horde of savage creatures. Finally, as I fell to the hordes around me, as they feasted on my flesh, two simple words left my mouth before those creatures tore my body apart.Dang it			"

YouTube™ Video: Death Road to Canada Review - Weird Horse Men in Masks?? OH MY! (PC) 

			Views: 200		

			Today I review Death Road to Canada, a horribly underrated zombie survival game featuring everything from Garfield to naked men in horse masks. Let me know what you think in the comments below!		

In Summary: A really entertaining, strangely overlooked zombie game. The game's sense of humour is great - what other zombie game would include naked men in horse masks and furries in Garfield suits? - and is a lot of fun to play. The only real downsides here are that it can be terribly unforgiving due to it's random nature and the lack of online multiplayer, but these are minor overall.Also that soundtrack is freakin' great. Play this.			"

												PROS-This game is hard which means you cant just beat this game in one try. You'll have to put actually effort to win-Each try depending on how long you live can last from 20min to a couple hours -cant stop playing one of those one more try games-customizable characters making the game more personalized-multiple game modes-tons of weapons and traits-game getting lots of updates-A.I is good enough to not get themselves killed easily-lots of charm-ZOMBIES!!!-fun combat -cant stay in a place too long making you decide whether or not to enter another location for just a little more supply or make that risky decision in events-amazing soundtrack-simple and changeable controls-fun in single player and co-opCONS-cant manage your food and who gets healed (characters will instantly heal a random person and it would be cool if you could decide who gets food)-some events instantly screw you over and you can be pretty far in a run when it happens (bandits mainly)-if you don't want a character to be on your team because your running out of food or their traits aren't useful anymore you cant get rid of them unless they die or you get somebody to replace the characterNEUTRAL-randomized events repeat a lot (more updates are coming soon and different characters have different reactions to events so its neutral)SUMMARYI love this game and I will not stop playing until I beat every game mode and maybe even make challenges for myself. This game has lots of features and charm with more features to come. My only problems are mainly just things I want added to the game or nitpicks I had with the game. I definitely recommend this game.			"

Now I love the various encounters with famous people and dogs and even being able to create my own friends and family. I have gotten to the last siege of the game 9 times now and I still havn't gotten past it.

												I may not have that many runs in yet but this game is great. My best run so far was when my buddy had dog friend as a perk and kept attracting dogs to the cause. About five days in I felt I was doing well then it happened. A seige completly devasted me killing the two humans in my party. One getting trapped in the horde and the other overcome by the grief of losing his partner charged head first shooting his shotgun as much as possible. All the while my lassy dog fighting with all its heart trying to save who ever was left. It only lasted seconds though the lassy all that remained. Making a getaway just as the horde closed in the dog was all I had left. Then my lassy decided it was time to stick those keys into the ignition and drive. The next day my lassy was mauled by a moose it was trying to help and thus ended my best run. 10/10			"

												It started out as an adventure of my friend, Nic, and I to Canada. We've known each other since we were small. Together we survived some pretty prickly situations and we met a few friends along the way, Rusty and Jacinda. We were a rag tag group of survivors content on the idea of making it to Canada. Things were looking great but unfortunately that didn't last long. We had lost our car and were forced to trek on foot. After what seemed to be an eternity, we spotted a cabin and a van that resembled a dog. After fighting through the horde of zombies, we managed to find the keys. We struggled to make it back to the van, but we were on our way to Canada once again!We all were in need of rest after the all the excitement we had endured during the day so we had found an empty house along the roadside. Night was falling upon us, as leader, I appointed Jacinda to barricade duty. This was a fatal decision on my part as leader. I may not have been perfect but I always seemed to keep us on top. Night had fallen and we were surrounded by zombies. With Jacinda's lackluster job, they had been able to break in and we had lost Nic and Rusty. Jacinda and I had narrowly escaped with our lives. Bitter towards Jacinda, I knew ultimately it was my decision which had led to the death of my childhood friend, Nic, and our beloved teammate, Rusty. Even after these events, we couldn't forget our initial goal of this journey. It was to make it to Canada. The sacrifice of our friend's could not be in vain. Once again, we pushed on.Low on supplies and down to just the two of us, we decided to enter a nearby town to gear up. The rain helped muffle our sounds enough to push past the large packs of angry and aggressive zombies. We found a house with enough supplies to last us the remainder of our trip. Now we just needed to get back to our van.On our way out the door, we noticed the large packs had moved to the outside of the house we were in, and sadly, we were spotted. We had tried to stand our ground, but were quickly overwhelmed and were forced to run. Making a mad dash to our van, we had gotten ourselves surrounded. It was in that moment that Jacinda had taken her hatchet and started fighting and pushing her way through one side. Myself and a bloody and beaten Jacinda had managed to make it to the doorway of a small house. She was bitten all over and we both knew that it was over for her. She told me to go inside without her. She said she was sorry but this is where her story ends. Reluctantly, I turned and closed the door.Here I sit in this small house, alone and waiting for my impending doom while I write this letter. Moans and sounds of limbs banging against the door. I feel at peace.10/10 Simulator for when 'murica falls because of the Trumpster. Would die travelling to Canada again.			"

												Let's be honest, zombie games are overdone. The genre is congested with stale, uninspired, boring and pointlessly challenging games that make this over saturated part of the market even more and more irrelevant.  But this game, with its goofy atmosphere, upbeat music  and charming art style, is breathing new life into this undead genre.Death Road to Canada is an easy game to pick up, an easy one to learn, but even harder to put down. The rogue-like adventure/survival aspects make every play through of this game different and interesting. And with the custom character feature, you are given the power to generate so many more possibilities as you experiment to see who works well with whom.Part of the reason this game is so easy to fall in love with is the culmination of its dorky sense of humor and catchy OST. For some unforeseeable reason, the chiptune music pairs perfectly with a game about blood, guts and survival. And the possibly fatal decisions you are making on the road turn from frustrating to hilarious due to the comical writing. Never before has a fart been the catalyst that led to my character's downfall, and for that reason alone this game deserves an award. I have but two complaints. First is that the RNG can sometimes ruin you. Often you are left with decisions while driving; do you surrender food or fight the bandits? Abandon the car or attempt to fix it? etc, etc. But at times you come to a decision where the solution involves shooting or other skills, and by some cruel twist of fate the character making this decision is the least proficient marksman. And you can't change that. This has never ruined the experience for me, mind you. With these decisions, the game is often fair. All of my failures are my own, not the game's. Save one instance, this is also my second complaint. For some reason, when the AI characters encounter a weapon they already have they get stuck in a perpetual loop of weapon switching. This doesn't happen too often, but when traveling the mall I had two characters of mine get stuck in this loop with umbrellas which resulted in their deaths. This led to a slippery slope which ended in a game over. So beware of that.Ultimately this game is more than worth your time and money. It's fair yet challenging. It's more fun than frustrating. And it's highly addictive. Give it a chance, especially if you love other rogue games like Binding of Isaac and things of that ilk. I'd also like to recommend checking out more of Rocketcat's games. I enjoy playing their mobile games, and I look forward to see what these devs will do in the future.TL;DRGood game. Happy chiptune music. Dog's use crowbars. Farts can be fatal. This game is rife with references to different shows/games/etc. Cat video magazines are a thing in this game and I'm sad that they aren't real. "

												Death Road to canada, a very hard yet enjoyable game. Hard because of how one second you have a full team where everyone is super good, but then when you get to a trader camp, have no food left, so then you steal some food from a trader, and then the whole camp kills everyone except your weak healer ;-;. Enjoyable because you could come a cross a very free horse man..... who cant wield any wepons so when your whole team dies excpet for him you basically are dead, which goes back to the hard thing XD. but there is a lot of replayability because of how everyone you meat on the road has random stats. There was this one time when i had a dog (o btw the dogs can talk and carry wepons XD) and she found a empty mascot suit that came to life and yelled ""I HATE MONDAYS!"", so then we did anything that a normal human would do, we recruted him to our group. But then things went wrong, one day while we were driving the suit just yell ""I HATE MONDAYS!"" and then he said ""AND TODAY IS A MONDAY"". then he teleported us all into a seige in a random set of woods and 2 of my people died, including my dog ;-;(just kidding it deserved it she was a jerk >:( ). so ya that is how i lost that game. But back to the actual review even with all of this fun stuff that i just talked about there are some cons one being the multiplayer, the second player has to each and everytime you go somewhere select the charrecter they want to play and join the fight which is realy tedious. Secondly the second player cannot go through doors which means, the first player has the infamous main charrecter deseas (but to a lower extent because they can die and the story goes on), this makes going through a house really annoying because the first player has to do everything. All in all this is a great game and i recomend it. And also the naked horse man is the most majestic thing i have seen in my life. :3			"

But, I wish we had online co-op, so it would be easier for me and my friends to play. but, like I said it's a good game.			"

												Roguelikes have quickly become one of my favorite genres and Death Road to Canada manages to take all the elements that make them exciting and engaging and apply them to zombie survival, a genre which has been starting to feel about as stale as the animate corpses they're based around. It's a modest package but like all good roguelikes the simplicty masks a great deal of depth. The music will get stuck in your head. Accept this.			"

												I've been following Rocketcat Games for years now, since their early iOS days...While I had been thoroughly disappointed in that they weren't making games for PC, I was thrilled when the kickstarter released for this game.Sadly, I didn't have the funds to back it at the time, although it's great to see a kickstarter game that actually gets finished.The game is really great. It's tough, like every rogue-like Rocketcat game.Randomness sometimes doesn't seem too random, seems to give dull loot and dull character encounters. Especially when you modify the save files and find out what in all is actuall IN this game.In the end, I wish there was more to the game, but I am still very satisfied with my purchase. The devs seem to be continuously adding. Highly recommend this game.			"

My only complaint(very minor though), is that when i have familar mode on, I only ever got 3 or 4 of the 8 characters i've made. Like the same few characters over and over and none of the others.

												Death Road to Canada is an absolutely adorable rouge-like game, despite the amount of spewing guts, bones and limbs flying everywhere around.Imagine for a second Faster Than Light fused with Project Zomboid, plus ridiculous amount of cute humor. Nothing vulgar or dark. Biggest insult you'll encounter in this game is Dingus (and even that is not an insult :p).There's almost not a single conversation in-game that didn't give me a little smile. Combat, and the whole game itself, is simple, minimalistic, non complex at all and still manages to be so addictive and amazing.Today many games advertise on ""randomly generated"" marketing, but not as many manage to execute the mechanic well. Death Road to Canada is not bragging about it, yet it has one of the most impressive randomization mechanics I've ever seen in games.When I said it has resemblance to FTL, it's not just about its replayability, but also the perfectly short campaign.Games with replay value should be exactly like that. Short and interesting, and not have 1000s of hours per playthrough. My shortest (successful) playthorugh on normal difficulty was approximately 1.5 hours. I am yet to do the longer campaign mode, but am already eager to try it out after countless amounts of fails.And speaking of fails, unlike many other rouge-like games, this one does not make you want to smash your keyboard againt the display when you lose. i can't quite explain why. Maybe it's the games general poistivity vibe, maybe it's because things lost are not so hard to gain. Maybe both.And finally for someone like myself who is absolutely into retro games, this one will grab nostalgia by its weakest point. Amazing pixel art combined with great 8-bit soundtrack is a perfect formula to satisfy all the gamers dating way back from times of NES/Sega consoles.Overall amazing.

												I can't tell you how much I love this game. This game easily became my favorite game of 2016 just because of how great it really is. Death Road To Canada is a special kind of game that uses things we have seen in other games, such as organ trail, but heavily improves on. From making friends and family as survivors, to laugh out loud funny moments, DRTC is well worth the asking price of $15. If you don't have this game, you should get it ASAP. There's something about killing zombies, telling everyone to ""COOL IT"" and fighting bigfoot that really keeps you into it. I love this game and I want to thank the dev for just blessing us with such a treat. DRTC is a must have for just about everyone, and I cannot wait to see how much more will be added on to this already amazing game. 10/10			"

												Do you like rogue-lites?Couch co-op? Zombies? Canada?Bandits? Oregon Trail?Shopping Carts? Dogs with shotguns?Car-throwing body builders?Exploding anime princesses?Party-mudering psychos in hockey masks?If you answerd yes to any of these then you'll DEFINITELY be interested in Death Road To Canada (DRTC)DRTC is an arcadey beat em' up/ shoot-em up zombie survival game with semi-randomised stat building, loot management, random encounters & choices, and hilarious writing. Combat is a little floaty and reminiscent of older SNES beat em ups, and weapons vary from the standard (fists/paws, tools, kitchenwares, sporting goods, bladed weapons, guns, etc.) to the crazy (bigass shotguns, miniguns, wizard staff,  airhorns, mjollnir, etc) and each his vary levels of attack and energy cost. Every playthrough is unique and you'll find different characters, weapons, cars and locations every playthrough.The only downside I can see is the sub-par follower AI. Followers can be set to Attack, Defend, or Running and while the AI does a great job at keeping them useful and alive, they occasionally bite off more than they can deal with.  "

I wasn't sure if I was going to like it when I first bought it, and grabbed it on a whim.  So glad I did now, its hours of fun and wacky adventuring.  If you are on the fence on this game, then get off it and jump on the Death Road to Canada! You will be glad you did!			"

												Y'ALL BEST DROP FIFTEEN SPARE BUCKS ON THIS GAME IF YA KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YA.Okay, southern accent aside [blame my upbringing], great af game. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to try and beat [throw in some dysentery and you have another Oregon Trail with zombies], but it's still fun. Granted, I grew up in the 90's/00's, not the 80's [this game's aesthetics], but in all honesty, the soundtrack will catch anyone's interest. Hell, just watch the trailer- it capture's the game's style PERFECTLY.And the gameplay? Ohoho, the gameplay. You want all these zombies dead? Use weapons. Oh no, one of your party members wound up tired from a random encounter event! Time to let them sleep in the car! Oh no, now that you don't have your full party out looting, there're all these cool weapons lying around! Oh WOW! Is that a ninja?! Let's drop some food at her feet and recruit her! Ooh cool, it's Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson [the last bodybuilder]! Let's get fitness tips from him! What?! The ninja disappeared- but we can teleport with those smoke bombs she left behind!This is all from a single playthrough of this game. I died on the last stretch as Papyrus from Undertale, having started out with Eggman and Metal Sonic from the Sonic franchise.And for that matter, custom characters. You want to fight zombies as yourself? Well, here's as close as you'll get! Want a crossover of this and another popular game like Overwatch? Click that custom characters button [Starbound is also great for this, by the way].tl;dr, this game's definitely worth its price. Only problem I have ewith it is that Starbound's been pulling more of my attention lately, haha.			"

												Some Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=kNJQgX1Q578Death Road to Canada is mostly a standard roguelike template with a zombie apocolypse setting. It will feel similar to other games such as FTL where you manage your resources and you move from one random 'instance' to another. If you're to make it to Canada at all it will primarily be down to luck and it is very difficult. For instance, the sieges rely heavily on you having spare ammunition as often you won't have the room to manouver around the horde, meaning you really just have to blast them away before you get eaten. If you have to rely on melee, you will soon be too tired to swing your weapon and it'll all be over soon enough. That said, I don't think any of these are bad things, if anything it's somewhat realistic.The locations and characters are all well drawn, interesting and genuinely upsetting to see eaten alive (especially the dog) and by the end of the play you'll feel like you've been through hell with them.The sounds are great although the music is a little too upbeat to ever give the game a truly grim or scary atmosphere. I guess it wouldn't really fit the asthetic of the game anyway if it tried to be anything other than funny.My only gripe would be that the characters get tired too quickly in combat. You often find yourself in situations where you need to run around in circles to avoid combat because you can't swing your weapon anymore. I don't know if the game would be any better without this mecahnic though, possibly losing too much difficulty if it was removed.All in all it's a great game for those that like Roguelikes. The price matches the content and polish of the game and the playthroughs aren't too long or short to make it accessible.			"

												Playing this game is just like experiencing a video game version of The Walking Dead by yourself. You have to make a choice under some emergency or special situation or decide which character to undertake certain task.Another thing that makes this game so attractive is that it really STIRS UP your emotion. When it comes to familiar character mode, it almost makes you so emotional when you see your family member or friends get eaten and you have no choice but to leave them behind.I play the game for about 7 or 8 times (4 hours) and make it to Canada once(I know someone who has played for 50+hours but still hasn't beat the game once) and have only played the normal mode and familiar character mode. The game depends on some luck but definitely a lot of skills. Recommend you to try this game out if you are not someone who is easily frustrated or really loves The Walking Dead.PS: 1. make sure you understand what each perk and trait stands for if you wanna ace the game. 2. sometimes a bot controlled character is more reliable than your buddy in co-op mode.

Along the road we  had to deal with loads of bandits, got really beefy, and charmed a dog into giving us free bullets.

												True story...Added my brother into the game as a custom character. He gets picked up by a party of three. They then all encounter a siege and all but my brother (named Dead Man) die. Next loot phase, he finds a machine, which I have him enter. He comes out with stat boosts and is now a dog. He manages to finish that loot phase without dying.Game indicates everyone is dead... but wait, there's still a dog. My brother turned dog then focuses on going to Canada and proceeds to DRIVE THE CAR.Next, we encounter bandits. Bandits let brother pass because, oh, he's just a dog.He then proceeds to pick up a person before coming across a cabin with a chainsaw, which he proceeds to pick up (being I'm controlling him) and starts killing zombies with a chainsaw while walking on his hind legs.If this wasn't enough, the next loot phase, he finds a blowtorch and lights himself on fire by accident, killing himself.I have never laughed this hard playing a game.10/10, would endlessly die traveling to Canada again. Great game.			"

												If this game still looks confusing, I should explain how it works.A group of up to four people is trying to make it to Canada, because of a zombie problem in the US.While some of the game consists around collecting resources and weaponry from places, the game mostly consists around making choices, which may increase stats or get you supplies.Every once and a while, the game will give you options on how to solve a problem. These problems are almost always based on a stat roll, where someone's stats may affect the outcome. Failed rolls may lowered stats, loss of supplies, car damage, or injury or death of characters in the group. Successful rolls will do the opposite, increase stats or gain supplies, but can also just be better than the failed rolls, such as getting out of a burning building unhurt, or charming bandits into taking less food from your group.Now I shall ramble about these stats. There are ten different stats that affect the game. 3 combat stats, 4 personality stats, 2 support stats, and morale. Combat stats consist of strength, fitness, and shooting. These usually help most with gathering supplies but are also in a few stat rolls. Personality stats consist of wits, attitude, composure, and loyalty. These stats only help in stat rolls but they rarely change. Support stats consist of medical and mechanical and while both help in roll checks, they also support the group. Medical allows you to heal teammates and mechanical allows you to repair your car and trust me when I say not having a car is REALLY bad. Morale definately changes the most out of any other stat and is the most common reward or consequence. Low morale will get teammates leaving the group or complaining that someone is pulling the group down. However, these stats are usually kept secret, and thus it's hard to know how the character would do in stat checks.Here are some Pros and Cons.PROS:- Addicting.- Funny.- Custom characters and perks and traits work incredibly well. Great for making friends and family. Characters are fun to make, fun to roleplay, and fun to see in game. Satisfying when perks and traits match well with the person.- Simple yet very nice pixel graphics.- Many, MANY different weapons.- Different, harder difficulties for players who had beaten normal modes.- Dogs.- Cats.- Goats.- I haven't actually played rare characters mode (I'm in love with familiar), but I've seen some of the characters and they have interesting mechanics that differentiate from normal characters and are REALLY funny ideas.- A zombie apocalypse that is funny and makes you feel awesome as oppose to some other zombie games that are darker and depressing, and a depressing zombie world isn't all that bad but the approach this game takes is happier and unique.- Setting AIs from Run, Defend or Fight is so good and so useful. Also, you can make it so that they use melee only, shooting only, or switch between.- Supply gathering never seems repetitive- A lot of replayability.- Unknown stats lead to tough decisions.- Really stressful... but in a good way.- Stats allow for specialization, which is very satisfying, especially in familiar characters mode.- I swear to you that the first time you play this game, you will NOT win. But as you work hard, practice over and over again, it may take 5, 10, or 50 games, but one day, you will complete it. You will beat the mode, and that was my most satisfying moment in this game.CONS- You need to beat Deadlier Road mode before you can play Rare EXTREME or Familiar EXTREME.- Can't make custom dogs or cats.- AI can be obnoxious and unresourceful, such as wasting ammo and trying to decide between two weapons that are exactly the same. And while I like that they don't use grenades anymore, they now take no weapon over a weak weapon, which can also be annoying.- The second last battle is super hard and really intense but the final battle is so much easier that the excitement dies down.However, the pros outweigh the cons here, so I'm giving this game a thumbs up.Oh, and by the way, I haven't even played multiplayer yet.

												Man, this is a fun game! It's got the right mood and the right style. It all fits together so well and it knows that it doesn't want to be taken too seriously. Its a great game if you want to play alone or with a friend. I also really like the character customization as well as the variety of other characters, traits, talents, and other things to spice up the game a bit.There is one bit of criticism that I want to give. I kinda feel that the music can be a bit repetetive.

												I played this game when it came out, and was on the fence about it. Since then, it's had a lot of patches, re-balances, and content updates, and they've made the game much more fun. Ammo is a little more plentiful, weapons last a little longer, it's easier to gain momentum as you go. There are higher difficulties for those who want it, but normal no longer feels arbitratily punishing.Further, I had a man get too sad to continue on the Death Road, and so he trained the dog that was his only companion to drive and told him to go and make him proud. Shotgun-wielding dog then made it to Canada.A+. 5/5. Jasper is the best dog.			"

												 On the Death Road, Casey the Surgeon and Spelunky Guy the Explorer were traveling in their car they had obtained after helping an alien fight a siege of zombies.Along with their Bodybuilder friend, they travel along almost reaching New York. Until they are stopped after they learn the D*A*N*G*E*R   R*A*N*G*E*R*S, and the unfortunate situation they had gotten themselves into to.After saving them and being blessed by Blue's pep talk, Green's swole tips, Orange's fitness training, and Pink healing wisdom; they found Vinny from Vinesauce, along with a gnome they found on the side of the road.In a unfortunate siege, Bodybuilder, Vinny, and Gnome all bit the dust.Without Spelunky Guy, which they booted out earlier, Casey traveled along the edge of New York almost to the border of Canada...With chainsaw, pistol, and hatchet in hand; she prepared for the next 4 hour siege that would decide her fate...Until she got stung and killed by a bee which flew into the car, after telling the bee, her final last words...COOL IT!!!

Most of the deaths were fun though, and I kinda rate on a dollar to ""enjoyed hour"" ratio, so Death Road is a clear winner.			"

Its a great game if you want to play alone or with a friend. I also really like the character customization as well as the variety of other characters, traits, talents, and other things to spice up the game a bit.There is one bit of criticism that I want to give. I kinda feel that the music can be a bit repetetive.

You can collect a ton of unique weapons and travel the open road to CANADA! It's great fun. I suggest everyone to get it. It's a solid fun game and it's even just as entertaining when you're on your last stretch in the game. Seriously. Worth the $15. It's tons of random events and it really delivers it! Hilarious situations and silly companions.			"

												8.5/10 game, 5/10 gameplayThis game isn't even RNG, the game director does everything it can to make it impossible for you to win. Extreme difficulty can be fun, but only if the difficulty can be overcome by enough skill.I had the dream team of 2, a dog and a human, the dog was max intellect (to the point of being able to use a gun), and we had a fast car with 200 gas, 15 food, great weapons etc and the human decided to leave the death road while at NEUTRAL positivity, leaving the dog. Immiedietly after that, i was stuck in a 2 hour hoard in a mall, with so many zombies that the doors were blocked off with no possible escape while the room was quickly filling up, nothing to throw or anything. There was no decicion i could of made earlier in my gameplay that could of prevented that death.With that out of the way, the gameplay you DO get before being excecuted is fun, plus the soundtrack is dank I'm only recommending this game to protect myself from a hundred fanboys that will swarm any negative comment about any game they play, and for anyone who likes getting hecked with a cactus over and over beause they enjoy the game up to that point			"

												Reach Canada, or die a lot trying to.Like the description says, this is a zombie road trip simulator with random events thrown as you go along your trip. What makes it special is the rare special character that pops up every now and then. Make no mistake, this is a very difficult game even on the easiest setting. Still, the content and story elements make dying and replaying fun and interesting that you won't notice you've been playing it for a while.Even though it's fundamentally a different game from Rocketcat's Wayward Souls, the ""one more try"" aspect is very much alive in Death Road.

												I'm going to be straight. This review would be a 5/10, but Steam insists on black and white reviews. Death Road has a lot going for it, from the charming graphics to the character customisation, but at its core, it's deeply flawed. I love rogue like games that allow you a chance to progress through a random universe, and FTL will always be a game I run back toward, but Death Road lacks this appeal. Strip away the zombies and you'll have a game where the random event/number generator won't just steer or manipulate your adventure, but flat out cripple it with zero input. You'll often find yourself being skewered by Bandits after running out of gas, simply because the game never provided enough for you to loot. For ten bucks it's a bit of fun, but it seems to lack some solid balance behind the chibi-sprites and Final Fantasy menus. I'd prefer it if this game rewarded skill a great deal more.			"

												This game is underrated. It's community isn't large. But the game has active developers who constantly update the game's contents and play a huge part in the forums. The game is full of tiny easter eggs such as popular characters in a form of a parody such as Rambo or Link from Legend of Zelda. The game has a higher difficulty curve but has a lot of replay value. It is easily worth 15 dollars for the amount of hours you can get out of the game. If you have a harder time with the game, it is very simple to modify a few game files that are shown in a discussion to make the gameplay experience easier. There are many different variations in the form of modes and for anyone who enjoy games such as FTL, Binding of Isaac, or others in this genre, you should at least give this game a try.			"

												The Lowest difficulty is too hard. so pretty much all the fun I have in this is making custom characters.but I'm still hoping for a lower difficulty. I could've bet it once but everyone was kicking everyone out of the party and I had to go through a seige with only 2 people. both died.			"

												Great game, distinct from The Organ Trail despite the same overall concept. This is more of a frenzied sprint rather than The Organ Trail's marathon - instead of distance, you have 15 days of driving from Florida to Canada. You need gas, food, and whatever you can get your hands on. Good luck, godspeed, try not to die.Exploring points of interest makes up a majority of the gameplay and is very action oriented. You can choose who goes out, and then the scavenging party goes of to a randomly generated SNES style action map level, very distinct from OT's EGA emulation. Shooting zombies was the main defense in OT. While that's an option here, there's a huge emphasis on melee, knocking down enemies, and mobility - running past zombies RE style is usually your best option when scavenging. You and your buddies can die out there, you do not immediately get sent back to safety OT style after zombie contact. It actually takes being cornered or prolonged zombie contact to die, though, hence the mobility emphasis.The only real complaint I have is that some mechanics may be initially obtuse, though you will probably be okay with this if you are a fan of rogue-likes that do similar things. For example, stats are hidden until you use them, which can be quite frustrating if you make assumptions or are gambling wildly on skills. I can't really say it's a negative as it does become more apparent over time who is good at what, or if you just make custom characters, but beware if it's your first time out!In summary: good gameplay that's more active and engaging. Lots of game modes, easy to get in and out of, quite funny, great music, and gives me an odd River City Ransom vibe when scavenging, especially with some ai partners or better yet a second local player along.Final note:For the love of god, if you find a man dressed as Garfield, DO NOT TAKE HIM ALONG. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. HE IS THE ANGEL OF DEATH AND MONDAYS.			"

												One part Zombieland, one part roguelike, and one part 2d action brawler, DRtC is the game that we all hope every zombie game will be. It is the game every zombie game promises to be. It's very specifically the game Organ Trail promised it would be.I wish I was articulate enough to explain why this game is so good, why it's such a delight to play, and why it's so addictive. I can't, but I hope however high my hours played gets for this will serve as a testament.Death Road To Canada is very, very good, and you should buy it.			"

Things were looking up!I even replaced a persons head with a pugs head...... because you can do that in this game so why not XDThen eventually all of the group died when they were left carless and were attempting to get another one.In summary:THIS GAME IS AWESOME!

Disclaimer: I received this pre-release copy from backing the original Kickstarter.Death Road To Canada is Oregon Trail. That's all it is. It's a weird simplified Oregon Trail-esque game with modern comedy writing and wacky events in lieu of normal strategic planning and ""realistic"" events like injuries and diseases. Now, you may be thinking, ""Isn't this just Organ Trail? Why do we need multiple games for this one extremely niche market?"" First of all, why don't we need multiple games, second of all, what we've got here is a pretty solid game.There are two phases to the game: traveling and the choices you make on the road, and scavenging for supplies on the open road. Traveling works the way any similar random game works, be it Oregon Trail or FTL or Convoy or whatever. You will find rest places or bandits or teammates on the open road, and decide who to barter with, what to trust, who to tell to COOL IT (from personal experience, there's basically never a reason to tell anyone to COOL IT, which is a shame). The scavenging, in my opinion, is where the real heart of the game lies. Here you are in full control, weaving past hordes of the undead and rummaging through any house you can find in search of food, gas, health, ammo, and the occasional weapon. Combat is a last resort, as ammo is limited and all weapons have a chance of breaking (the AI apparently did not get this memo, as it will move to smack any zombie that comes within smacking distance, even if all they have at their disposal is an old umbrella or a femur). House maps are generated from random rooms, whose floor plans defy the laws of known physics with rooms that overlap each other and lead to god knows where. It's silly. It takes getting used to.Of course, any game following in the old footsteps of good old ""terrible death is educational"" will stumble onto the same problems as its predecessors: everything is left to the whims of the RNG, and the RNG hates your stupid surviving face. If your team has high morale, whoops, here's an event that drops everyone's morale. Got a surplus of food? Be a shame if some bandits were to get in your way. What's that? You have a car with gas? What do you think this is, Daytona USA? Sometimes while you're driving, characters will just argue with each other and lower their morale. Having an RNG that doesn't basically cheat certainly isn't easy, but typically there's some kind of middle ground. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure erred on the side of ""too easy"", though primarily that was due to gameplay being more based on skill than luck. In Death Road To Canada, the skill-based sections are enjoyable, but the luck-based ones are just a reminder to properly lubricate before making your decision.I do have to give this game props where it's due: for a zombie game, it does a good job at making a proper zombie atmosphere. The zombies are many and travel in hordes, and there's a thick VHS film grain that covers the screen giving it a classic Romero graphic look. (And yes, it can be turned off.) The one real surprising outlier is the music, which for whatever reason is some arcadey honky-tonk that adds to the game's ""quirkiness"", and if that's the kinda word that makes your stomach crawl up your esophagus, you might as well look elsewhere. The whole game's about being quirky, from constant references to being ""swole"" to the ability to play as a car-driving dog. This here is the silly version of Organ Trail, that's the name it's made for itself and that's how I enjoy it. (I mean, enjoying is sort of a relative term. I enjoy it as long as the game allows me to enjoy it before throwing me into a ditch and stealing my♥♥♥♥♥♥)Bottom line: this game is a game of Russian Roulette at some twisted carnival with the biggest teddy bear if you last five rounds. It's a twelve inch novelty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it's made of cubes because this game has a quirky pixel art style. And if you're the kind of masochistic thrill seeker who's into that stuff, then this is a fine way to spend your evening.			"

												I started off as a young athletic man with nothing to lose, riding solo in the zombie apocalypse or however you spell it. I looted a few stores here and there gathering food and medical supplies for my journey ahead. After gathering some supplies, a woman named Jetta wanted to join my group! I was excited and anxious to see what the future had in store for the two of us. We got along pretty well, she always told me to shut up, but I think she was just flirting. All of a sudden, our first siege came upon us! Luckily it wasn't too big of a horde and, I had gathered enough bullets for my pistol to hold off the zombies until we could escape. We made it out alive, our first siege. We had been through a lot after only being together for a day or two. I think our relationship was really beginning to blossom! We were getting closer and closer to Canada, we could taste the free health care. Then another lone survivor came across my group! His name was Drew and he claimed that he had a very skilled background in medicine! I was happy to hear that because a doctor is always a plus in the zombie apocalypse! Me, Drew, Jetta, fighting through grocery stores and small towns in search of more supplies to aid us in our survival. After looting some stores, we came across the greatest loot we would ever find, his name, Alessandro, the most loyal creature in the world, Alessandro the hero hound. The 4 of us continued on our journey, we were running low on medical supplies, and Jetta was very low on health, living on the edge between life and death. We stopped in a junk yard in the hopes of finding more medical supplies, and more gas. The horde here was massive, it wasn't looking good for the group. We rummaged through old broken down cars and piles of rubble, no medical supplies, but I did find a safe with a bunch of gas so that helped. I wanted to stay a little longer to see if we could find anything to heal Jetta. That was when I knew that I made a horrible mistake, we were cornered, the only way out was through a horde of 40+ zombies. Swinging our hatchets and kitchen knives we fought as hard as we could through the horde to try and get Jetta out and to safety, but...it was too late, Jetta's baseball bat snapped in the middle of the horde...One bite to the neck...Jetta went down. The zombies began ripping her to shreds, all we could do was watch. We had to get out of there before the zombies got to us too, ""BARK! BARK!"" Alessandro said as we drove off from the junkyard. A truly emotional loss for the group, but its survival of the fittest and we had to move on. Right after our junkyard disaster we came across a SIEGE! I was low on health and I had no ammo for my pistol. Drew had a strange looking orange knife and I thought to myself, WOW HE HAS SOME SORT OF LEGENDARY WEAPON, but no...it was just a rusty machete. The siege horde was massive, and we were stuck in a building with no rooms. Zombies came flooding in through the door, we hacked away at their rotting heads hoping to make it out alive! I was down to my last few breaths, I was exhausted from swinging my hatchet, my hits were doing no damage, I had to run into another corner to recuperate while Drew and Alessandro kept fighting. I regained my strength and dove back into the zombies, FOR ALESSANDRO!!! I yelled. Drew was slightly offended but he didn't have time to get angry, because a zombie had grabbed me by the leg right as I dove into the horde. I went down, as the zombies ate away at my insides and I let out my final screams of life, I heard Drew and Alessandro scamper out of the house, they made it out alive. Then there were two, Drew and Alessandro the hero hound. Their drive to their next location did not last long, they came across an impassable obstacle, they were doomed, and they knew it from the start, it was...The River of Death. Drew and Alessandro ran into the wet, dark, zombie filled maze. Alessandro sprinted ahead to find an escape route while Drew followed far behind fighting through the zombies with an old kitchen knife. Alessandro needed help fighting the zombies and was also having trouble finding an escape route, so he ran back to find Drew. They met eyes from across the hall...there was a look of shock on Drew's face, he had nowhere to run, zombies were latched on to his legs. He was dragged to the floor as almost a hundred zombies hurried to his corpse to get their long awaited meal. Alessandro knew he couldn't stay in this hell hole. He was low on health and didn't know if he would make it out alive, but he had to try. He ran as fast as he could dodging left and right between massive groups of zombies. He busted through 3 or 4 doors trying to find the light to the outside. He knew he was getting close, but he could hear zombies all around him, his adrenalin spiked and he began to run faster than he had ever run before. Alessandro ran through a door into a long empty hallway, he was home free! He thought he was...the hallway ran out...the splashes of water coming from hundreds of zombies filled the room at the end of the hallway. With zombies in front of him marching towards, and plenty of zombies still hungry from Drew's devouring, Alessandro had no choice. He had to hope that there was a door to the outside through this massive crowd, he went for it. The zombies grabbed at him and snatched at his weak legs hoping to bring him down just like they did to Drew. Alessandro could see the light! The doorway to freedom! The road to Canada was just in front of him waiting to be taken on for at least a bit longer! He was almost out of the horde, he could smell the air from outside, he kicked it into high gear! Sprinting for his life and hoping to avenge the others and make it to Canada! Alessandro knew he had made it past the horde, until...he felt a tug at his leg, he FLEW BACK into the horde!! Alessandro yelped and howled for his friends, but they were all gone, the dream of making it to Canada was lost. RIP Alessandro, we will never forget you,If you have read up to this point, thank you very much, this took me forever to write. Awesome first playthrough, and I expect there will be many more to come, thanks for reading my story, also buy this game it's really fun!12/10 would run mindlessly through giant zombie horde with no health again.

												Started off with Genji and Tasha things were going smooth on our quest to Canada and along the way to Canada we met Billy. He was a fisherman with immense shooting skills but with a kind heart. He gave us some catfish when we were running low on food and helped us on our seige when we were sandwiched by zombies. Unfortunately the bandits came and   Billy sacrificed himself for us to move on. Next we stumble upon Ninja and took her in our team. Things were not doing well as our morale decreased and Tasha being the b*** that she is, wanted to boot Genji out of the team. Genji leaves and we went on and eventually  Tasha went through a votex and became Ahsat met Artsy on the way. Upon recruiting Artsy, Ninja just threw a smoke bomb and basically ditched the team. Things were going solid as a two man team and eventually we met Gnomey. Gnomey had a short time with us since he protected us from the bandits that tried to steal our food and supplies. We went onward and we met Snoop Dog. He was a nice guy sang songs for us and boosted the morale. We went to raid a supermarket packed with zombies and Snoop Dog being the gangster that he is shooted the zombies like theres no tomorrow. Unfortunately Snoop Dog got caught by the zombie horde and became food for the zombies. With just a few days away from Canada the team happened to stumble upon Ramboux. We paid 10 food to him to be in our team unfortunately he died right after we got him since he was unable to ride the car. As our journey to Canada almost comes to end we were getting worried that we do not have enough man power to do the last fight to Canada. Fortunate enough we saw Fatty Tuna the nerd and got him along with some medical supplies. Along the way we saw a HELP banner and paved our way through the zombies to recruit the last man in our team which was Kelp. We went on a seige for 4 hours and went through the Canadian boarder, fended off the last set of zombies and eventually we got into Canada with the Prime minister welcoming our team with open arms.

A truly emotional loss for the group, but its survival of the fittest and we had to move on. Right after our junkyard disaster we came across a SIEGE! I was low on health and I had no ammo for my pistol. Drew had a strange looking orange knife and I thought to myself, WOW HE HAS SOME SORT OF LEGENDARY WEAPON, but no...it was just a rusty machete. The siege horde was massive, and we were stuck in a building with no rooms. Zombies came flooding in through the door, we hacked away at their rotting heads hoping to make it out alive! I was down to my last few breaths, I was exhausted from swinging my hatchet, my hits were doing no damage, I had to run into another corner to recuperate while Drew and Alessandro kept fighting. I regained my strength and dove back into the zombies, FOR ALESSANDRO!!! I yelled. Drew was slightly offended but he didn't have time to get angry, because a zombie had grabbed me by the leg right as I dove into the horde. I went down, as the zombies ate away at my insides and I let out my final screams of life, I heard Drew and Alessandro scamper out of the house, they made it out alive. Then there were two, Drew and Alessandro the hero hound. Their drive to their next location did not last long, they came across an impassable obstacle, they were doomed, and they knew it from the start, it was...The River of Death. Drew and Alessandro ran into the wet, dark, zombie filled maze. Alessandro sprinted ahead to find an escape route while Drew followed far behind fighting through the zombies with an old kitchen knife. Alessandro needed help fighting the zombies and was also having trouble finding an escape route, so he ran back to find Drew. They met eyes from across the hall...there was a look of shock on Drew's face, he had nowhere to run, zombies were latched on to his legs. He was dragged to the floor as almost a hundred zombies hurried to his corpse to get their long awaited meal. Alessandro knew he couldn't stay in this hell hole. He was low on health and didn't know if he would make it out alive, but he had to try. He ran as fast as he could dodging left and right between massive groups of zombies. He busted through 3 or 4 doors trying to find the light to the outside. He knew he was getting close, but he could hear zombies all around him, his adrenalin spiked and he began to run faster than he had ever run before. Alessandro ran through a door into a long empty hallway, he was home free! He thought he was...the hallway ran out...the splashes of water coming from hundreds of zombies filled the room at the end of the hallway. With zombies in front of him marching towards, and plenty of zombies still hungry from Drew's devouring, Alessandro had no choice. He had to hope that there was a door to the outside through this massive crowd, he went for it. The zombies grabbed at him and snatched at his weak legs hoping to bring him down just like they did to Drew. Alessandro could see the light! The doorway to freedom! The road to Canada was just in front of him waiting to be taken on for at least a bit longer! He was almost out of the horde, he could smell the air from outside, he kicked it into high gear! Sprinting for his life and hoping to avenge the others and make it to Canada! Alessandro knew he had made it past the horde, until...he felt a tug at his leg, he FLEW BACK into the horde!! Alessandro yelped and howled for his friends, but they were all gone, the dream of making it to Canada was lost. RIP Alessandro, we will never forget you,If you have read up to this point, thank you very much, this took me forever to write. Awesome first playthrough, and I expect there will be many more to come, thanks for reading my story, also buy this game it's really fun!12/10 would run mindlessly through giant zombie horde with no health again.

												Started off with Genji and Tasha things were going smooth on our quest to Canada and along the way to Canada we met Billy. He was a fisherman with immense shooting skills but with a kind heart. He gave us some catfish when we were running low on food and helped us on our seige when we were sandwiched by zombies. Unfortunately the bandits came and   Billy sacrificed himself for us to move on. Next we stumble upon Ninja and took her in our team. Things were not doing well as our morale decreased and Tasha being the b*** that she is, wanted to boot Genji out of the team. Genji leaves and we went on and eventually  Tasha went through a votex and became Ahsat met Artsy on the way. Upon recruiting Artsy, Ninja just threw a smoke bomb and basically ditched the team. Things were going solid as a two man team and eventually we met Gnomey. Gnomey had a short time with us since he protected us from the bandits that tried to steal our food and supplies. We went onward and we met Snoop Dog. He was a nice guy sang songs for us and boosted the morale. We went to raid a supermarket packed with zombies and Snoop Dog being the gangster that he is shooted the zombies like theres no tomorrow. Unfortunately Snoop Dog got caught by the zombie horde and became food for the zombies. With just a few days away from Canada the team happened to stumble upon Ramboux. We paid 10 food to him to be in our team unfortunately he died right after we got him since he was unable to ride the car. As our journey to Canada almost comes to end we were getting worried that we do not have enough man power to do the last fight to Canada. Fortunate enough we saw Fatty Tuna the nerd and got him along with some medical supplies. Along the way we saw a HELP banner and paved our way through the zombies to recruit the last man in our team which was Kelp. We went on a seige for 4 hours and went through the Canadian boarder, fended off the last set of zombies and eventually we got into Canada with the Prime minister welcoming our team with open arms.

												Death road to Canada is such a fantastic game and it has so many hilarious and surprising moments. The Goal of this game is to get to Canada while driving with a bunch of jerks and tryingto keep your face from being eaten off ;) .Since this game is pretty difficult and will probably take a few tries before you get to Canada, but when you do, it is so satisfying. Probably the most satsifying thing that i have ever done (now that i think about it, that sounds really sad). Overall its a really fun game and had some good laughs. Highly recommend getting this game. :)Pros:-Fun gameplay-Different modes to keep things intresting-As tough as old boots-Great music-The pixel art style is amazing (love all the small details)-Lots of trial and error-pretty good character customisationCons:-Sometimes it can be a bit unfair10/10 would play this againand againand again:P			"

												Looking for an addicting zombie-strategy-survival-humor genre game? Well... you won't find it here. You'll find it on the DEATH ROAD TO CANADA! Awesome character traits make for a random and surprisingly charming adventure down the highway, through towns and past many zombies. But, don't worry if charm and humor ain't your thing, there are plenty of melee weapons and firearms to bash and snipe zombies with, as you scavenge each randomly generated pitstop on your journey! Also, don't forget to grab a friend and play the controller supported 2 player, for extra chaos and good ol times.			"

(Disclaimer : Review key recieved from developer)The Death Road to Canada... or as I like to call it : ""The Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America""Bored of those gritty zombie games where you're stuck with relentless brown and green? Tired of those endless drudges through gore and misery only to wind up going from day to day rooting out tins of cold baked beans? Sick and tired of having to scavenge hundreds of planks to make fences for your little survivor camp? Hacked off at seeing the same identikit survivors which stories which all blend into each other and just make you reach for the booze?Fret no longer, for I present the Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in AmericaDeath Road to Canada is possibly one of the most lighthearted zombie murder games I've run into in a long while, ostensibly taking it's inspiration from the Organ Trail, and FTL, you're put in charge of two survivors, and a car. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to drive to Canada, or to die trying. Hint, you're going to die a fair few times before you get there, but that's all part of the learning experience. You can either take some random survivors in a default game setting, or you can create your own survivors, be they friends or people you want to see turned into zombie chow, and set off with your own choice of team, with the intent of picking up more friends along the way.Combat is a little bit loose, but that's intended by design, you are after all, survivors, not trained soldiers, so you tend to waff your melee weapons in the general direction of whatever is closest to you, said weapons ranging from spatulas (no, no joke) right the way through to sledgehammers, hockeysticks, nailboards, and baseball bats. Then you've the proper shootybang stuff with revolvers, pistols, shotguns and so on. The stats of your survivor play a significant part in how many swings they'll get in before they become ""winded"", or in the case of firearms, just how accurate they're prone to be (shotguns you can get away with giving to anyone, other guns you'll want to be a bit more careful with).DRtC has strong DNA, with a lot of content and a strong level of depth involvedFor what could have been a fairly simple pick up and play game, there's a lot of statistical complexity under the hood, with weapons having their own ""drain"" on player stamina, weapons having their own fire rate, accuracy and spread, and vehicles having their own consumption rate, and durability. Characters too have their own personality traits and benefits, meaning that it's unlikely you'll run across two survivors that are exactly the same in a given playthrough, as a direct result, DRtC becomes a far stronger game than the Organ Trail and actually elevates itself up to the company of games like Death Skid Marks, which shares the same kind of irreverant humour and sense of fun about it.This doesn't even touch on the fact there's pets you can bring into the team (Dogs and Cats, though as yet I've not been successful at grabbing either), there's choose your own adventure style events, though these are more simplistic than say, FTL, they are stat based in terms of the choices you get with differing chances of success, and depending on your survivors, you may get presented with different options from one playthrough to the next.Closing thoughtsDeath Road to Canada -could- have been a throwaway title, or something that would have been fun for a pick up and play but ultimately not something that would stand up to repeated scrutiny. I'm glad to report that this definitely is not the case, there's real longevity here, and there's a definite gem of a game here. One that has managed to emerge as another Kickstarter success (which is a bit of a rarity these days) and one the devs rightly should be quite happy about.Verdict : Highly recommended, with one caveat which I'll discuss below. However, I do not feel that it significantly detracts from the game itself as this is a single player experience, it would be nice to see it resolved somewhen though.There -is- one unanswered question which I'll update my review with as time progresses, and that concerns a KS exclusive piece of content which whilst not *vast*, is game affecting. As is normal for any review I do, I do ""due dilligence"" on all games that go through Kickstarter, and I highlight such things because in the interests of being thorough, that's my job. One of the reward tiers ($50) provided backers with a specific game unlock, allowing them to have the option of a kitten or puppy as a ""morale booster"" who would grow into a full team member over time, at the cost of an additional food drain. This would be something in the -longer term- I'd like to see added as purchasable DLC of some sort, as it would be nice to have the full game made ""content complete"", however, as I state above, because this game is predominantly a singleplayer experience, this isn't something that will affect players beyond their personal preference.This element will be removed or revised as more information is made available.

Product received for free
												This game is very enjoyable for those who like to play hack and slash and like to make choices that can be very severe to your team's survival. Some of the deaths during these ""car events"" can be very silly but yet really stupid. The AI in this game is very well tbh imo. Descision making is sometimes hard and having to select the right choice (because yolo) for a situation is very satisfying. I can tell you that Rocketcat Games developers are very active and supportive and will always try to update the game! I bought two of their games on my iphone and they really good! This game is also coming to ios so if you want to having a bigger discount on this game, wait around one month to buy this game on your phone. I think its around 7 dollars. or u can just wait for the steam sale for this game if u want ^.^i highly recommend this game if you are in to the Telltales, ""walking dead"" kind of games and if you like the ""castle crashers"" hack and slash kind of gameplay!also every character you play with or make in the game has different traits and personalities and every new game has a random generated events and maps, so that makes the replay value increase!

												I made my best friend and myself. We were killin it. We found two dogs, a poodle we didn't trust named Peyton, and a Husky we loved named Veer. We walked into a fancy house and we both died. Veer took over. He drove Peyton around barking at wildlife and drooling. They found my boyfriend on the side of the road playing video games and picked him up. He died right away. Veer dies as well trying to save him. He was a good dog. Peyton is the only one left. I still didn't trust him. He finds OctoDad on the side of the road, he finally gets in the car. They go to a junkyard for gas and Octodad dies. Then Peyton dies on the way out. Doesn't surprise me everyone dies and Peyton was left. 10/10 for suspcious dogs.			"

												So I started up a game with a guy named Oswoldo and another named Wrektangle. It starts off fine, and everything seems to be working out. Until they reach a bandit check point, so I sent oswoldo to convince them to let us go through... But Oswoldo turns out to be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥and joins the bandits ditching Wrektangle. Wrektangle drives ahead for a little while and it was smooth sailing but then he ran into an NPC named Clown. The logical course of action was for Wrektangle to let him in the car... you know the sensible thing to do. From then on Clown seemed to just be a little bit wierd until about 8 days till Canada. They sit down in an abondoned building in some infested city Wrektangle happed upon some rare loot, a nice suprise after wasting 2 hours trying find keys to an ice cream truck. Clown then whips out a music box and starts playing circus music. Wrektangle goes to yell at him but Clown is gone without a trace. Then as the music is still playing a massive hoard of zomies storm into the building and Wrektangle goes down in a blaze of glory... Thus ends the tragic tale of Wrektangle10/10 Game would clown again			"

												I can't say enough praise about this game, but not everything is flawless.First and foremost, the music. I love the music and it's so happy and really brings out the emotion within this game, there is only a couple sad/intense songs which might drive certain people away from this game. Also to go along with the music is the pixel aesthetic. However, the pixel theme makes the characters very simple and their features become hard to distinguish. But the thing the game does beautifully with the art is backgrounds, the color and motion the scenery provides is nice to look at and really adds to the atmosphere.Game play:There's two sections of game play within Death Road to Canada: the action section and the Oregon Trail RNG Strategy DND Skill Checkin' Character Deathin' Road to the Maple Syrupy Hockey Land of Stereotypes Eh? section. The action phase consists of you and your party picking up whatever weaponry is lying around and bashing the brains out of some un-dead walking corpses, there is no special abilities or attacks but there is a stamina function. This stamina function limits you in a good way, because you can't swing(but you can shoot) wildly, forcing you to be smart about your attacks, also factored by the size of the hoard, and the location of the horde. During these action phases, you will be doing one of two things: looting or defending. Always Be Looting, your source of resources defined by your choice of location to go find the good stuff in. Then there is siege. I hate siege. A siege is where you are confined to a small area of map for an extended period of time left with whatever you find and what you have on you to fend against increasingly large hoards of zombabos- some of these are really, REALLY, difficult if you don't have a reasonable supply of bullets and guns.On to the RNG aspect portion of the game. Your typical food and gas and such, but there is also a great system of morale. Morale is simple, it's how happy your party members are. Good morale will keep things running while bad morale will lead to run ending situations- keep your morale high by having enough supplies. I think the morale system is fair and not overly imposing so it adds a fun layer to the car ride to Canada. Along the road you will have to make several choices, and what may seem like the correct answer is not always the right answer. There are a lot of hard decisions that are designed to screw you over- unless you have a person with enough skill to get you out of that sticky situation. There are an assortment of skills and they each do different things, some carry over into the action portions while the others exist purely for the car portions- you will want to keep these up as they will get you out of ALOT of bad times. Other than that everything else is pretty cookie-cutter.Now most of this game is great, but one thing this game does not do well is UI. The UI is very interrupting, as the only way to switch your party leader is via the pause menu in-game, which really takes away from that intense horde fight going on. Also ammo splitting is the most needed thing in the UI but it's not fully there, as in there is not a specific way to do this, and the current system is confusing. The UI looks nice enough but the functionality needs to be a lot better- there's no direct switching of items from party member to party member in the pre-mission gear assignment screen.Hopefully this will get implemented however.Overall if you are into rougelikes, this game is great for beginners and experienced fans of the genre looking for a greater challenge- some of the modes are ball-bustingly hard for all you masochists out there. Give it a shot and I'm sure you will love this game.			"

												I don't normally review games, sorry if this is a little rough around the edges, for a short written review. TL;DR: ""You like Rouge-like games? You like funny things? Buy this, yo.""I've already spent several hours in the game, and am still far from getting bored with the game, there's so much to love.The Story:Very Straightforward, your goal is to get from Canada, from the US (I want to say you start in Florida). However, like many things in life, the story's more about the journey, than the destination. You'll be creating your own story along the way, from choosing how to handle a roadside robbery, to kick certain members out of the group when they complain about the ride too much, to wether or not to give that seemingly pretty friendly dog a knife. Gameplay:The gameplay is fairly straightforward in Death Road. The game is perma-death, meaning once you lose a character, until you start another run they're gone for good.There are a set of skills in the game that are rolled mostly randomly for all characters, from being able to repair your car to how you handle certain weapons. These stats come into play in a variety of different way throughout the game.  Your character(s) have two three major types of weapons they can use. 1) Melee weapons. Almost all melee weapons will make you tired after repeated use, which takes a few moments before you can really start swinging at the undead spooks again. Most Melee weapons will also break after a certain period of time.2) Guns. Totally rad. Guns are awesome in every way. Except they take from a preeeeeeeeetty limited supply of bullets. Some runs you're going to have next to no bullets, sometimes you'll have...no bullets. Later on you'll be gathering enough to reliably use them, but conserve ammo wisely.3) Throwables, from grenades to Molotovs, these help clear a massive wave of zombies. They can also hurt your friends. Found that out the hard way. You're charged with fighting horde after horde of the Zombie menace, scavenging for much needed food, fuel, weapons, and ammo. Each character can only take 3 bites from a zombie before they turn into some new lunch meat, so zombies can fairly consistantly pose a large threat in big enough numbers. Getting swarmed and surrounded from all sides will mean almost certain death,Music:Aaaahhhhhhh the music is great in this game. It's an awesome contrast from the pretty bleak situation your characters find themselves in, and its actually really enjoyable to listen to while managing your inventory, and making important choices like who should get the first bite of that candy bar. Extra Things Worth Mentioning:Two major things stand out to me that I think are worth bringing up, the Humor and the Character Creator.The Humor in Death Road is phenominal. Several moments in the game had me actually laughing out loud, atracting the unwanted attention of curious family members. One of my favorite examples of this is:One of the events your party can experence is stopping by a campsite, and telling ghost stories to one another. However, in one of my runs, only a single character remained, but I saw the ""Tell ghost stories"" option was still there. Assuming it would act like I had more than one party memeber, I clicked it, and was pleasantly supprised by the special dialouge, where half-way through my character discovered he was telling his story to ghosts the entire time. The Charactor Creator is also a huge pro in my book. You can create and save up to (roughly) 16 charactes. You can customize several things about these characters, from their looks, to their outlook on life. You can choose to take One or Two of these characters with you at the begining of the game, or instead chose to randomize your starting cast. You will rarely run into your characters you created when you encounter random people throughout the course of the game, making it a very special treat to run into that weird 12th grade teacher you chose to spend 15 minutes creating in a video game. All in all I really, really loved the game, and highly suggest it to anyone interested in rougelikes, zombies, or even just fun in general. The game oozes quality, from the random times you'll find yourself bartering with dogs with guns to when you choose to end an argument by driving a car into a tree.			"

												I can't stop playing this game. It's great for quick breaks between other games, it's great for dedicated game sessions, it's just great. Combat is simple but satisfying - push button to swing weapon, push button to swap weapons, use arrow keys to move - and the way zombies work in this game mean you can easily beat a couple of them, but a hoard is terrifying - as it should be!The game is about taking a team of losers to Canada while driving up the East Coast of the US - unlike reality, it's easy to cross the border - the main trouble is getting there, as America's filled with vile zombies. You have to scavenge food and supplies and keep your car loaded while keeping your team alive, and it's not an easy task.The primary obstacle for you will be your team: they're very good at being idiots. A simple fart in the car will drive them apart until someone breaks down and leaves, they can get into deadly pose-offs with muscular men, they can for some reason pick up the worst hitchhikers you've ever met. They also eat too much food!...But they're your losers. Literally! You can make custom characters, so if you want to bring Megatron and Starscream on a roadtrip to Canada together, my god you can do it. No, they won't be robots, but Megatron can flip out in righteous fury and punch your friends, so it's as accurate as you're gonna get.So, let's see: graphics, check. They're clear and easy to read, and gorgeous to boot. Music? Addicting with enough variety that I'm happy to keep listening to it. Controls? Very tidy, and you can remap them! Gameplay? Excellent.So how about that Early Access status? The game as-is is complete: you can play a game on normal mode and run into plenty of variety, enemies, characters, etc - without feeling like it's incomplete. There's no glaringly missing features, and I've only encountered one or two mild bugs in my playtime (while playing in the Beta branch, so those are being worked on). The EA status means they're adding even more stuff and tweaking the game (LET THE AI USE AIRHORNS PLEASE IT'S HILARIOUS) and making it even more better! :DIn short: game is good. I've wasted at least 27 hours on it, beat several of the game modes, and splatted my team against more zombies than I care to count. Please treat yourself to it!			"

												TL: DR at bottom, and obviously, spoiler alert.I bought this when I got sick, had FOUR DAYS to play it pretty much non stop, and still have yet to get to Canada. No matter how seriously OP I twink my characters, no matter what strategy I take, this entire game can beat you on a bad coin flip. Even if you manage to RNG your way to the final stretch, the game will almost always end with two consecutive Sieges, the first typically in somewhere claustrophobic and the actual final wave I've only ever gotten to ONE TIME, (throughout about 20 playthroughs) so I couldn't tell you one way or the other. I've read a few threads and basically everyone I see is under the consensus that this game is unfairly hard and genuinely not fun after the first several playthroughs. The only reason I'm not going to get a steam refund is because I've seen a few news feeds hinting at a better build of the game and several Dev posts saying that they're tweaking/introducing a legacy system where your death doesn't mean you've totally lost everything.This game just really makes me mad, it's a very fun and always an entertaining co-op experience, but when you want to just chill and have an easy run, there's really nothing you can do. This is on-par with Don't Starve in that death is a serious thing, but at least Don't Starve had some ways of giving you a cushion to land on when you inevitably did die, and made you give more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥about your character. I spent most of my games distributing stat bonuses/level ups/etc amongst my whole crew but then ALL OF THEM DIED ON THE FINAL WAVE and made me feel like it sincerely did not matter what I did during the entire game leading up to that point. I just needed a lucky dice roll or something completely arbitrary and out of my control. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful game and taken at what it was marketed as, it's extremely true-to-form. There were plenty of times when I died in Oregon Trail from bad RNG or some dumbass mistake, plenty of times I died in Don't Starve thanks to my poor reaction time or underestimating an enemy, and I really don't think I'm a bad gamer or have a weak disposition for real-time combat, I just can't take that helpless feeling I get when my crew gets shredded by ONE SINGLE SIEGE after literally hours of beating zombie♥♥♥♥♥like a rented mule.If you plan on getting this game, buy it during Halloween when it's on sale, I paid around $10 for it and I feel like that may have been a LITTLE too much, but for the content, I thought it was fair. It's retail price is absurd for what basically ammounts to a novelty game that you'll never get to play casually.TL:DR - Don't expect to beat it, but it's a great arcade game.			"

												if you are caught in a zombie apocalypse i would recommend you and your gang of immature 90s kids going to newfoundland. it's basically a giant island off the coast of canada. so if the infection does eventually get to canada you can rest easy knowing it's impossible to die by being eaten to death there.if that doesn't convince you to go to newfoundland, then i'm sure you're not interested in beautiful landscaping with cold winters and warm summers covering all of the 108,860 km2 (42,030 sq mi) island discovered by the one and only leif erikson and declared england's first overseas colony under royal charter of queen elizabeth i of england. if you're looking for some sick pics for your facebook page then you can go to gros-morne national park, being the largest park in alantic canada. if you like parks and history then the terra nova national park is for you, showcasing the history of of the whole island itself. if you feel like walking up a 546 m (1,791 ft) mountain or going down it in a pair of skis, then come to the marble mountain ski resort.if that still didn't convince you then at least buy death road to canada, s'il vous plaît.

												This is likely exactly what you think it is.  You are going along a path and, along the way, there are encounters both of a ""choose your own adventure"" kind where it's a scenario and it asks for a reaction and of a more interactive nature.  The interactive scenarios have you raiding buildings or making your way through floods of zombies.It is a lot like Organ Trail, except there's a bit more of an exploration / combat aspect than I remember Organ Trail having (though it's been awhile since I played, so maybe I've forgotten a bit ...).  If you liked Organ Trail, you will probably like this game as well.The game isn't overly complicated and that's part of what I enjoy.  I'm not keen on survival games where you have to micromanage your characters down to the bowel movements -- this game has just the right level of complexity, I feel, in the way it keeps track of morale, food, and health.I definitely recommend it (edited this review because my complaints are all resolved!)

												WOW, I didnt expect to have as much fun as I didMe and my brother both payed for half the game, so about $7 each, and we were AMAZED in how cool it was! You can create your own friends, and then have them die to a toe stub, and then find ANOTHER friend you created, and have him sacraficed, and then find  a COOL new dude you didnt create, and have him die on siege, making YOU the only survivor on the DEATH ROAD TO CANADA!Its a Rogue-like dungeon crawler with Oregon trail mixed into it. when you first play, you have about 15 days to get to canada in your car. Although after you beat that, NEW modes can be unlocked, like the ability to have 20 days to make it, or 9 days to make it, or harder modes to the already hard experience. If you remember Organ Trail (that 8-bit zombie game simular to Oregon Trail) then think of this as a HUGE upgrade to that, with better music, graphics, and more to do!This game is also riddled with jokes AND references, like the all famous exterminator car Dale had in King of the Hill, the fact that DOGS CAN DRIVE, and the Anime peddler. There are references to Overwatch, Star Wars, and Simpsons, and thats JUST the tip of it all.One of my only problems is that its EXTREMELY hard and time consuming, it took me, like, 35 hours just to finish normal mode, and I BARELY made it, with almost dead, and me left. If you dont like Chaos and losing EVERYTHING, then I'd maybe stay away from this one.			"

At first, I was hesitant to let go of 15 bucks on this one, I'm glad I did. Totally worth it. Well-played, Rocketcat... well-played, indeed. "

												Her name was Ora, she was a dog, and this is her tail...*baddum tst*I rescued Ora from a zombie infested apartment building, Ora had placed a banner out front which read ""Bark! Bark!"" Clearly a cry for help.Ora became an invaluable member of the team, more than pulling her weight in combat, picking up grenades, and outting me for farting in the car via an extremely complex deductive process. However the defining victory of Ora was when heavily armed bandits and their totally not Immortan Joe leader had blocked the road before us and demanded all our food, weapons, supplies, and even our car! Ora had a plan, Ora always  had a plan. Ora proceeded to honk the horn, which amused the bandits to no end upon seeing an animal doing that. They let us through unharmed, we celebrated by robbing a lone trader.Our merry band of jerks was not too stay bonded forever. We had stopped at a non-descript town to scavange for supplies, the zombies were out thick that day and so we had to do a lot more smashing, shooting, and running than usual. By the time we had picked the town clean it was swarming like a bee hive on Honey Day and we were firing all our guns to get out. In the Chaos I lost sight of Ora....I didn't notice her absence until we were in the car and pulling away...the last image I have of her is seared in my mind, valiantly wielding a golf club, hundreds of zombies closing in...We died horribly just south of the border, and we deserved it for leaving Ora behind..10/10 would purchase Melton the Cat from a witch for 15 hamburgers again.

												there´s a bug where team buddies who try to pick up a weapon from the floor get stuck in the animation - i manage once  to push a  charakter so the animation ends and everything was fine, but another time i lost that buddie and was all alone which end´s in a 1.5hrs siege and a following death - sadly i never get such far!!! Allright you can actually take command over any party member, so if you take control of the bugged dude everything is fine - but it´s not something i wanna do very often in the middle of a fight. in the last game i get closer to canada - and an error message pops up - GAME OVER!!! i never made it to canada, not even in a video game!i like the game! but with such problems in the game - wait for a discount (next sale)!

												Her name was Ora, she was a dog, and this is her tail...*baddum tst*I rescued Ora from a zombie infested apartment building, Ora had placed a banner out front which read ""Bark! Bark!"" Clearly a cry for help.Ora became an invaluable member of the team, more than pulling her weight in combat, picking up grenades, and outting me for farting in the car via an extremely complex deductive process. However the defining victory of Ora was when heavily armed bandits and their totally not Immortan Joe leader had blocked the road before us and demanded all our food, weapons, supplies, and even our car! Ora had a plan, Ora always  had a plan. Ora proceeded to honk the horn, which amused the bandits to no end upon seeing an animal doing that. They let us through unharmed, we celebrated by robbing a lone trader.Our merry band of jerks was not too stay bonded forever. We had stopped at a non-descript town to scavange for supplies, the zombies were out thick that day and so we had to do a lot more smashing, shooting, and running than usual. By the time we had picked the town clean it was swarming like a bee hive on Honey Day and we were firing all our guns to get out.

												I despise zombie games.  There are SO many zombie games these days, and tv shows for that matter, that they aren't done with any real sense of quality.  Deathroad to Canada is a completely different beast.  Yes it has zombies and for some it may be the focus of the game.  For me it's not.  I can honestly say I haven't felt this refreshed with a zombie esque type game in a very long time, the last was Zombie Estate 1 and 2 for Xbox 360 from the indie dev selection.  When I initially heard about this game I had reservations.  Only upon watching people play, like Vinesauce who ironically solidified my decision to buy this gem, did I realise this game was far better than it seems at times.  The genuine tongue and cheek humor adds flavor to moments when you are stuck in a room with 30+ zombies pining after you like some schoolgirl over her boy band crush.  As of writing this I have YET to actually beat the game.  This doesn't frustrate me or anything because each time I get close, I am sent into erratic displays of giddy laughter.  Can't tell you how many times I think I'm doing great only to lose my car, then get swarmed by a massive horde of zombies in a horrible attempt to find another vehicle.   By the end I'm left with 1 person, sometimes a bat wielding dog who happens to know how to DRIVE :P.  Needless to say I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and everyone who asked my opinion.			"

												To put it simply, this game is a lot of fun.  Great art, an awesome soundtrack and rock solid gameplay make this an easy reccomendation. The game can feel challenging without feeling punishing and random without giving you that feeling of being at the mercy of a set of invisble dice.

												Saw some gaming YouTube channels I regularly watch play it, thought it was cool (especially since I'm fond of roguelikes), and added it to my wishlist on Steam and kind of forgot about it. Cue Autumn sale. Decided to buy it. Let it sit in my library for about a week or so before deciding to play.All I can say is this: WOW.Right from the start, it's pretty damn good. Nothing says ""awesome"" like slashing through zombies while going north (Though a zombie apocalypse seems more like an average day in Florida anyways). Sure, I haven't had too many runs so far, but they were surprisingly kind of intense. Every death sucks, especially in the times where I've gotten so far, but that's roguelikes for you, and that's why I love them.Also, I'm Alexandra the resilient martial artist with a kitchen knife. Can't beat that.			"

												Death Road to Canada is a Arcade style looter shooter in a sort of top down perspective. the game centers around driving....or walking to canada. to get there, you must have enough Gas, Food, Ammo, Morale, and actual people to get there. The game is broken up into two sections, on the road driving where it is some downtime between looting grounds, which you dont have to do if you dont want to. the looting. The game is fun, and very retro like. However the game is VERY difficult, and the easier settings are locked behind you completing the road to canada first. I wish it was the opposite way around. The game also is a bit unforgiving, as some times if one person dies, the other one will too if you have both on a scavenge. Even so It is totally work 15 bucks, and I'd rate it a 8.8/10 personally - Very good.			"

												Basically RNG: The Game. Everything in this game is RNG, essential supplies is from RNG, HEALING event is RNG (WTF?), recruitment is from RNG, events are RNG (Usually never good, just RNG of which bad events you get), and the RNG in the game is designed against you.The first layer of RNG is the crashes, if you survived that and thought you are good, don't worry, you are not, the rest of the RNG is by design.For example, I made a healing character, had plenty of med supplies, but that character will never trigger the healing event even though people are almost dead. Then later down the road she died trying to pull her teeth out even though according to the dialog choice she use to be a dentist. Or another example, I made a mechanic to fix cars, but the game always insist on making my healer fix the car. And of course she can't fix the car because her stats in mechanics is too low, so on top of losing the car, she's also in a bad mood, which if low enough the member will leave permanantly.Also your main NEEDS to be an mechanic because the moment you are on foot when your car breaks down, you either get robbed of all your supply (you can choose to fight the bandits but the RNG never let me win yet), or you lose your life tripping and hurt yourself on flat road (again WTF?). And once your food is all robbed, and your healing supply is all used up, your mood drops to rock bottom, and your character automatically leave the team, even your main character. And then it's game over.There are so many more problem with this game I just can't be bothered listing them all at this time. The game don't feel complete, interface needs some ironing out, game needs SERIOUS re-balance. And the bugs is in your face, I'm certain the only reason the game have a save feature at all is for crashes. I mean you can't save manually, and you can't leave the game and come back either, I tried and my save is gone once I re-launched the game.Not adviced to purchase until the game is fixed.			"

												So this game is Oregon Trail + Final Fight. It's hard, there's a lot of RNG, and it can be completely unfair at times. It's also some of the most fun I've had playing a game with permadeath in a LONG time (and I LOVE games with permadeath)!The games are quick (probably 2 hours for a full game, obviously much less if you lose early) so losing isn't that big of a deal, there are a TON of options and encounters and characters and items and what not, so replayability is through the roof, the action portion of the game is super solid, and the writing and stylings are fantastic (and quite amusing). There are also lots of little touches here and there (like the varied font types or the special characters) that really make this game so much more then just the sum of it's parts.Finally, I can't close this review without talking about the devs. These guys are amazing. Go check the dicussion forums. There are multiple devs answering questions, personally taking suggestions, working with people to squash bugs, listening and respondign to critism, talking about the future of the game (which apparently is going to be TONS of new content, with the devs saying something like ""you keep playing and we'll keep making content""), etc. Seriously, this level of positive community interaction is just incredible and the devs deserve a LOT of kudos, love, and sales of their (totally awesome) game because of it.So yeah, buy this game. It's silly fun, a crazy good value for the money, and the devs are rock stars. Can't recommend it enough.			"

												Death Road To Canada is a retro-style, top-down action game with light RPG elements. I've been waiting to play this game for a really long time, and so far it has lived up to my expectations. The gameplay is simple to pick up, but there is some strategy involved. The player has to strike a careful balance between avoiding zombies and looting quickly, but also killing enough zombies in a previous room so that the player doesn't get boxed into the next room. The environments, story and characters are all randomized, so every playthrough is different, although you will visit the same locations a lot. There is enough variety in the story to keep things fresh. Replayability 10/10The graphics are retro-style and well done. Like the rest of the game, the artwork has personality. No crazy over-the-top effects, but also not generic. It really feels like a game from 1989, not a game from 2016 pretending to be a game from 1989. Graphics 8/10The story is randomly generated, and often surprised me with its off-beat humour. There are many, many story events that can occur, and your choices can have very dire circumstances. As much as you might want to pick the 'cool' or 'funny' or 'interesting' choice, it might be best to pick the 'safe' choice, or else your trip to Canada will be cut short! Story 8/10The music is great! Very catchy retro-chiptune kind of stuff, mixed in with some nifty guitars. Very off-beat and full of personality. The music is light-hearted, and not moody. In some cases it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the game, but I kind of prefer that the music is so light-hearted for a game about the zombie apocalypse. Music 9/10Overall, this game is probably the only game I'm going to play for a long time. I have almost 70 games in my Steam library, and I feel like this is the best $15 I've ever spent. Overall 9/10Pros: - VERY replayable. Every time you die, you want to start over again, and it doesn't feel that repetitive.- Fun, laid back game, but with a lot of hectic gameplay moments- Good balance of difficulty, good balance of loot- Lots of modes to unlockCons: - None			"

												i admit it, i love this game but i gotta be honest here. there is only one way you will ever beat the game, and that is rare characters mode. in the game you pik up ppl on your way 2 canada, all of them are normal people with normal weapons, but with rare characters mode, all picked up characters have some like superpowers. i was playing common characters mode so the characters i make show up, and i was on the last day when a 2 hour seige appears and the only room you have is a square 5 steps in each direction. this game is very fun with friends, but i think the developers shouldn't make a seige on the last day 2 hourslong, maybe just an ABL (always be looting) mission with mega cheesed at night or something. but dont buy this if you have anger issues though			"

												I adore this game but for the love of♥♥♥♥♥♥please fix control binding, controller support, coop menu navigation. Basically literally anything to do with the menus before you actually start playing. Everytime I start the game I have to wrestle with the controls and button remapping and it's incredibly frustrating. The game itself is radical, but there's only so long I can fight through those annoyances and keep playing. Also since I'm being demanding and greedy anyways, online coop?Just want to reiterate, the game is awesome, and it's everything I hoped it would be. I'm so glad it finally released as I've been following it for what feels like forever. The menu and control binding just needs a lot of work. I won't even get into how hard it was to set up TWO controllers at once.			"

												Initially it was fun, but after more than twenty tries, reading through forums and tips and hints, I still can't beat this game. After several  random events that just kill my characters for no obvious reasons and after two consecutive siege events that each last 1 hrs and 4 hrs, I am starting to thnk this game is full of bs.The control is problematic as well, you can't simply turn your face from left to right or right to left by pressing the a or s bottom, you need to make a clockwise or counterclockwise turn, which wasted time when a horde is near - thus increase the difficulty of the game.The game is not well polished, fun but frustrating.I would recommend it only they do some imporvement on it.

												Though a neat idea, and fun upfront, the game really has some major issues.  The first being a horrible UI and control scheme.  Trying to use firearms is difficult at best because it tries to control like a twin-stick, but you can't map controls for that properly.  The other major issue is the random nature of things leaves you in constant situations where you just can't win.  A seige with a bad map or a series of bad encounters and you just have to restart.  Though I appreciate rouge-likes for what they are, this one just seems to fall into a habit of screwing over the player as much as possible.  The ability to make custom characters is a nice feature, it lets you fine tune a pair of characters and can make things more enjoyable.  I feel that this game falls into the trap that many rouge-likes seem to of a lack of information as a difficulty setting.  Yes, part of that style game is not necessarily knowing what the item you just picked up does and having to learn it, but this game takes that to extremes by not knowing your character stats or abilities picking up weapons that have no durability rating or any stats at all.  A lack of information to make a decision is not a good way to set difficulties, it is just frustrating.I saw this played on Youtube and it looked fun.  And though I enjoyed it for a few run throughs and dealt with the frustrations for a while, really after 30 minutes you're just repeating the same frustrations over and over.  Some people really like it, and good for them.  For me, I just can't keep beating my head into the brick wall of frustration and random events.			"

												If you're expecting a skill based rogue-like title like Risk of Rain, Enter the Gungeon, Binding of Isaac or even Nuclear Throne. You most likely won't enjoy this game as the majority of your runs will be entirely governed by RNG for the most part.Combat is pretty clunky and in a game where dealing with a horde of over 50 zombies is the norm, combat mechanics simply need to be solid. There's major lack of visual feedback when swinging melee weapons (mostly due to all the sprites being at 3/4 view) I understand that it's to make the sprites look more appealing but due to this design choice, the player is not able to discern which direction their character is swinging UNTIL they start swinging. Since every swing drains an invisible stamina gauge, this can get you killed very easily. Then there's guns.Guns cannot be aimed properly, by which I mean it's ENTIRELY automatic you CANNOT aim your gun. You can't aim your gun...in a zombie shooting game. Am I the only one that finds that completely asinine!? Because of this you'll often find yourself wasting ammo and not shooting the zombies you WANT to shoot down. Character stats will  sometimes be completely disregarded by events and you'll often die through no fault of your own. If you're gonna make a game procedurally generated, runs have to be POSSIBLE and in this game you will often find runs to be IMPOSSIBLE to complete regardless of whether or not you make all the right decisions. DRtC is incredibly luck-based and personally that just doesn't fly if I'm trying to have fun.			"

												I regret buying this game.  I'm sure it's fine for some, but I have had no fun in my attempts to play it.  The gameplay is difficult, but not in a way I feel I can learn to master - rather, there's just hordes and hordes of zombies that wear down by attrition, no matter how well I play, and the random finding of items means I can't mitigate damage most of the time.  Figuring out what characters can actually do is opaque and frustrating most of the time, and the game provides very little sense for how far a journey has progressed or how long remains.  I have no sense of progress, just an unending feeling of 'oh, another thing is happening.'The randomly generated story bits have yet to be very funny, certainly nowhere near entertaining enough to keep my interest, given the gameplay.

												It is a fun game. Graphics are cutesy, performance is flawless on my horrifyingly bad laptop. Sound design is average, but does what it's needed. It has nice humor and the gameplay itself is either a hit or a miss for most people. I personally enjoyed it, but It isn't really strong enough to be a selling point for its current price.This is basically a hack and slash combined with oregon tra- wait. Better yet, this is basically the Super Amazing Vagon Adventure with better combat, better weapons and better humor.But it is still not worth it enough to pay the hefty price tag. I would recommend it if it is on a good at least 40% sale. Otherwise, just skip.			"

												My biggest gripe with this game is the recycled assets. Play Punch Quest and you will see what I mean. This game was developed right after that released and the menus, rainbow effects, and almost every SFX is ripped from that game. Kind of lame considering this was funded on kickstarter. I even mentioned it during development and they claimed they were place holders. Nope. Other than that the game is ok. Oregon Trail meets Zombies.			"

												Death Road to Canada is an RNG-fest that much is obvious and can be managable, however my biggest gripe with the game lies within reaching Canada, the goal of the game. A lot of the Fun comes from making custom characters and getting funny stories of them doing funny stuff and watching your friends die. The games RNG heavy events with higher penaltys seem to become more frequent nearing the end ( this may just be perception) but heres what makes this game frustrating just before the End you are faced with a final Siege (a small map with thousands of zombies spawning and chasing you until the timer runs out) the timer for which is about 4times as long as the average siege and is impossible to survive with all characters.But now you've done it, you can finally go to canada, except there's another final Challenge after the final challenge, this one is easier you can simply dodge the zombies (since you'll most likely be alone).Challenge and getting f**ed by RNG can be a lot of fun if it's not ridiculously unfair. Darkest Dungeon is a prime example, it's hard and the RNG is unforgiving but it doean't reach a point of unfair that makes you really angry.This game is a game where the Journey is a lot better than it's destination.I personally liked this game, but it suffers from not having multiplayer coop (perhaps up to 4 players with harder challenges) that's available online.I have people locally I can play with, but we'll probably play a better game than this.And to me a satisfying ending is important, because even when I made it, I was angry at the game for not providing a fair challenge.So for the current Price Tag I wouldn't recommend it.

I guess there's a way to learn to deal with them, but it just didn't keep me hooked long enough to care.			"

												First off, I've been playing this longer then it may appear. Played quite a bit over a friends house.The Good: The premise, characters, and setting are quirky (in a good way) and interesting.The Bad: Almost everything else is underwhelming.Some have compared this to the Oregon Trail. That comparison does not work in this game's favor because it has fewer features than an educational game that didn't have a lot of features in the first place. In Oregon Trail you can set your pace. In Death Road to Canada your pace is dependent on what car you have and what car you have is dependent on RNG. In Oregon Trail you can make major decisions on what path to take. In Death Road to Canada your decisions are limited to “Do you go to the bar or go to the old safe house”. In Oregon Trail you can set your rations, choose where you want to rest, and make a profit off trading. In Death Road to Canada you can't set anything like that, where you can rest is dependent on RNG, and most of the trading is worthless because obtaining items to even begin to have something to trade is RNG and there are few if any ways to profit off of trading.Most if not all of your characters stats will be hidden until revealed. Revealing them requires making the character perform a certain action. If their stat is bad they will fail wasting your time and possibility costing you something,Much of the game is spent scavenging or fighting zombies. The problem is combat is both bare bones and tedious. You will be using melee weapons most of the time because they are the easiest to find. Aside from weapons like the chainsaw they lack any interesting differences other than things like “X does slightly more damage than Y”. Guns (if you find them or enough ammo to make them useful) suffer from the same affliction.Melee combat consist of swinging, waiting to recovering and doing the same thing again. Swing too much and your character will momentary get tired indicated by them sweating. Combine this with uninteresting weapons, uninteresting environments, and one note foes and the tedium really starts to set in especially during sieges.At times (especially near the end of the game) you will be required to face sieges. During such sieges you are trapped in a building with zombies coming through the floor/ceiling and you are required to hold them off until they stop spawning. After that you have to exit through a small doorway which will usually be blocked by a good amount of zombies until you can clear enough to run past them. Some may find this game difficult. My recommendation is to find a better game with a more interesting combat system or features in general. This game is not worth gitting gud at. The concept is good but the execution leaves much to be desired.			"

												Fun for a few hours but ultimately just a frustrating RNG roulette spin. Most runs end up as wipes through no fault of the player, but rather because the game throws a bunch of ridiculously harsh RNG events at you, or fails to provide enough supplies in the looting missions (most notably gas.. and once the group is on foot, the RNG gets even worse).Needs online multiplayer. Needs an easier/casual mode.Needs a reduction to the amount or severity (or both) of negative RNG events.Overpriced at $15. Would not recommend buying it unless you have friends/family to regularly play it with you and help keep the mood light-hearted and fun. The developers claim it was designed with replay value in mind, but it seems to me it was designed to FORCE replay by rigging RNG against the player. It's bad game design.			"

												While I loved the asthetic of this game a lot, I couldn't play this game. Single player was interesting although I didn't have much time to play it. I bought this with a friend to try to co-op, only then noticing that it was only local co-op. While playing however, it was insanely frustrating having the game focus on the party leader, Player 1, to the point where every room you entered or exited from resulted in having to enter as Player 2 again.  Thus meaning that I was spending most of my time entering the game rather than playing it. Perhaps these issues came from the way the controller is used for the game, I found myself often pressing to enter and instead taking over for player 1.			"

												This game feels extremely sticky and doesn't flow well. I can't find myself enjoying the gameplay remotely enough to want to continue.

												TLDR: Fantastically put together, ruined by the RNG events.One example, finally having a good run (these are rare) find some a special character to join as a 3rd addition to the team. Event pops up demanding I remove 1 character as they are not pulling their weight... yes, very fair.I've died mostly in thanks to the RNG events that have crippled my team, supplies, stolen all food, broke my car, etc etc. From my experience 70% of the events are out to ruin something for you, and will. Another example, I found a stack 31 of Gas while exploring which is rare since you find no more than 4 pieces in 1 exploration area on average. The very next moment the RNG even of ""Bandit humanoid demands all your gas"" You see, that's not fun, all you're doing is stripping away the hard fought items the players have worked to strip from the cold dead hands of zombies and other carcasses. The mechanics of some of the events can be steered with specific skills for people, but since you can't check your members skills and most the people on your team have their skills hidden, it makes it an awesome russian RNG roulette.The scavanging/exploring part of the game is challenging later on but a lot of fun. if you get cornered and eaten to pieces 9 times out of 10 it's your fault. Finding what you need to do to tackle the next area is a lot of the fun, but I have trouble recommending this game, as you spend 20 minutes pulling off some amazing survival stunt... Only to have the contents you came back with, ripped from you due to an ""event"" you have have little control over. If there weren't so many I wouldn't complain, but just knowing you're highly likely to lose somerthing 70% of the time doesn't make you want to continue playing.Last note, never go on foot. Those events will guarantee your death.			"

												I don't know what these reviewers are talking about, the game is rather easy, the combat is boring, the music (there's like 2 songs) is incredibly annoying, the 'hardest' part of the game is dealing with the RNG, since you can't choose to stop and grab supplies you have to roll the random event then roll the right kind of location then it in turn must roll x amount of food.If I wanted to deal with $15 of RNG I'd at least play Darkest Dungeon, at least its gameplay doesn't remind me of everything I dislike about Dynasty Warriors.Furthermore the game is quite buggy, I had one level that was in the sewers, and for the rest of the game everything had the echoy tunnel sound effects, also my characters status screen was bugged, ""WOPR doesn't mind zombies, but he HATES "" ...hates what?  couldn't fit the full text in the box?Give it a pass, refunded.

I know, its pixelated indie, but... cmon, it launches in like 800x600 window and thats native resolution of it - everything above will be upscaled with soap3. Awfull Controls. Games like this should be twin-stick. Instead of this, we are forced to hit to the same direction, we moves. Nuff said4. Dumb AI. There is a part in tutorial, where you need to run to the other room near horde of zombies. I've did it without any problems, but... know, what my follower did? HE DIED.

												Fundamentally flawed. It has a lot of customization options and a lot of variables, but the combat is ruined by the stamina system making most party members unable to swing most weapons for more than two seconds. Even characters with extra strength can hardly swing as much as they should be able to and most characters can only swing less than a handful of times before you get tired.Another flaw with the combat is so many weapons are essentially worthless and take far too many hits to kill a single zombie, leading to being overwhelmed easily unless your RNG was good enough to get you good weapons. The game also gets kind of repetitive despite the different events that can occur, either because events are near identical or because there simply aren't enough unique events to shake up each time through. Another problem with the events is there are a few things in this game that lead to instant death a good portion of the time and have little to no positives but you'd never know unless you experienced it already. One example of this is a goat that you can try to milk or recruit, but both options often lead to the death of a party member and the goat will wander off after recruiting it. Events like this are unfair and are just trying to be humorous, even though it can ruin a run. Overall, I had more fun making my friends in the character customization screen than I did actually playing the game.			"

												- No tutorials is fine and good, but the only informations about the game in hints is too barebone somehow.- The movement of characters is highly frustrating, they will resist for whatever reason facing the direction you wish them to.You would expect some smooth animation from the screenshots of the game. Well you would be wrong : animation is so basic it is a huge obstacle to a fun gameplay. Expect frustration.- No way to push a swarm back to get out of a bad situation which makes for a super boring gamelpay. You would expect to be able to push back one zombie out of the way ? Nope you will get stuck and die thanks to the most basic of basics gameplay mechanisms.- Interface is highly undevelopped, forcing you to move the joypad wgen using upper buttons to move around should be a no brainer, but I uess it is too much to ask for.- The chararcters timing and rest to swing weapons is slow, and makes for a boring gameplay.Overall, the game, though quite charming, is really underdevelopped to say the least.The barebone nature of it all is too in your face to recommend this game for me.The graphic style chosen would be good with some more refinement to animation and player movement. As it is. It feels like an untalented money grab thing where anything goes under the umbrella of nostalgia.It really doesn't : develop your game properly, pixel style nostalgia is not an excuse for barebone gameplay.

												The game isn't to bad brings back that retro feeling on a classic console.The game play is pretty good the story and all not bad eitherthe only thing that i found lacking was... the fact the game is way to short...yeah it is challenging and all but it's just... ""short""and the characters usually keep repeating the same lines over and over again...weapons.. a decent selection and all but not really a whole lot from both melee and ranged.it does get funny time to time but again the repeat of the same lines the characters say tend to get old.. fastbut making the right or wrong choices which does make things easier or more harder. The lower the moral the more and more bickering and all insues with the character(s)i like th fact there are game modes.. but they don't really make the game to much.. more interestingThere are a lot more other Zombie based like generics out there that do much more than this can do in other waysbut i like the fact the creator was using what he/she could keep at it pleasei would definitely like too see what other games you might come around with.sadly though for the price tag.. the game kind of isn't worth getting honestlyand sadly i wouldn't even suggest friends getting this since the only way to play with a friend is if they connected a controller etc to the same PC and or labtop.What would of been nice if there was some way to make a open world style kind of game play or such.The price and that is what killed it for me don't like paying anything over  $10 for a game that is a challenge but is like a NES game where its only 2-3 levels and its the end of the gameI'd over all rate this game ona 3/5the game still is fun to play and i am not at all saying not to buy it.maybe the dev is going to add more? or maybe he/she will continue on another DRC 2?

												Finally the first time i make it to the end of canada after so many tries and the ending is the stupidest thing ive ever witnessed. once you reach the end you have to fight off one last wave with a bunch of canadian allies but the horde was so big all of the allies died immediately and some mega robot canadian guy which im assuming is supposed to destroy the wave came in the second i died. Its a great game to play all the way through to the end i dont want to say i hate it but fun features are unlocked after you survive and make it to canada once. And considering this was my best performance yet, to lose it all just because the ending ends you faster than you can be saved. I just want to play other modes rather than the normal ones.  "

												It's a lot like Oregon Trail, if the trail lead to Canada, and was full of zombies. It's a funny, addictively balanced, and the mechanics are simple enough for non-gamers to enjoy the drop-in multiplayer. Multiplayer works strangely, player-one controls all level transitions (walking through doors), and can inadvertantly kill player-two off screen by leaving them in a bad situation when leaving a room. Player-two can swap to any party member, but if all but one member die, player-one recieves control of the only remaining character. The rogue-like mechanics are great for replayability, and there are enough special characters to keep bumping into new ones, but the text events could use some expansion. Replaying enough to win in each game mode makes most choices too familiar.			"

												I don't think I've ever been so instantly in love with a game, and I am astonished at how such a simple game can be so replayable. It's hilariously easy to introduce new players to how it works, too. The gameplay mechanics and even the level of cruelty is completely perfect, and the whole game is almost timeless.One thing would make this game timeless. A true classic, which would not just give it one year of replayability, but like 10 years...I know the devs aren't at all interested in adding online multiplayer - it's gonna be their draw card for the sequel.Listen to me RocketCat. Listen hard. I don't want a sequel to this game. Adding multiplayer is the only thing this game needs to be perfect. Even just 2 player with direct IP address connection would be absolutely fine. You remember those old school PC games which connected over TCP/IP... it was always next to the LAN option in the multiplayer menu haha. No lobby. No interface. No server browser. No chat - people can use Mumble in the background or whatever really. I think you guys are overestimating how much work is involved to appease 99% of players who really want this feature. I know you don't have web-ops in the company - but don't tell me this game wasn't a runaway success and can't justify a single dude for 3 months to add the feature which would probably double the audience...You could charge even more for the game - hell I'd even buy a 'multiplayer DLC' for double the price. I really REALLY would.Anyway, I'm leaving a recommendation - of course - but please RocketCat, multiplayer would make this game last foreverrr...r.r.rrr...			"

												God how I wish this was online multiplayer, my buddy and I play the shared screen local, but the potential this has with a possible 4 player co op online is just insane. I love the rogue like elements and the atmosphere even a pixel art game like this can bring. The difficulty is high but also fair, deaths rarely feel cheap, at least to me, and generally I can quickly identify why I died. This game has heart and soul, but I dont know if its for everyone. But I highly reccomend this.			"

												It took me 6 hrs just to cross to Canada. What's more, I only did it on the ""Special Characters"" mode (which is practically the ""easy"" mode). I haven't completed the normal mode due to its sheer difficulty, but that difficulty is basically the fun part of the game (along with its sense of humor). If it were to be easy, it would get boring pretty quickly. The RNG may be a bit tough at times, but it merely poses as a fun challenge.This game can act as a really nice outlet to pass an hour or two of boredom, whether it be alone or with a friend; its humorous antics would surely entertain you throughout the playthrough. I recommend this game to people who have a bit of time to spend learing over and over again of the game mechanics, and for those who love RNG, co-op, humor, and management games. It is definitely worth its price.			"

												Let me recap my first real experience with this game.So I start off with my first two characters, Gert and Egg. As we drive from hell- er, Florida to Canada, we encounter something just along the border of Florida- and I'm not even kidding- a MAGICaL ANIME GIRL just plows through a horde of zombies with the power of weeb magic. ""You're kidding?"" I think to myself.

Me being♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game and the controls being a little wonky to get used to (I'd recommend rebinding them to your personal preferences.), Gert dies.

Anime girl's face gets distorted as hell. What the ♥♥♥♥. No matter, let's just get our way through this shopping mart. Immediately after we hit the Death Road again, Anime girl ♥♥♥♥ing blows up in an explosion of kawaii weeb♥♥♥♥♥♥and now everyone is a hit away from death. But hey, at least we have guns and ammo now. We then get seiged in a cabin the size of a pencil point and I die fumbling around trying to get my guns back.Pretty cool game.			"

												After traveling for 5 days with no incidents, my group found a mansion on the side of the road and invited themselves in, only for the owner to show up a few seconds later. I asked her to join my group, and she declined unless I would give him 10 of my food. I ignored his request, only for him to start panicking and ask us to let her join if she gave us food. We accepted, and she was a valuble member of the team, killing tens of zombies and being very productive in skill rolls.

												Fun game, I would buy it at this price. It is getting frequent updates, so each time you come back there will be something new. The one thing I don't like about the game is the RNG, I have terrible luck and even with a Sumo, Lunk and his M*ster Sword, a pug, and a fisherman I can't win. I lost health and got robbed and several hordes later, everyone died. I love this game, but until the RNG is fixed it is incredibly hard to win.			"

												First off, I would just like to say this is one of the best games I have found on Steam, especially for the price. Anyone who says otherwise is a d*ngus and will be made to open a box with poop on the lid. Or thrown out of a car in favour of the next dog that comes along. Believe me, I'll do it. The only way I can describe Death Road To Canada is 'an arcade-aesthetic, rogue-like, zombocalypse, choose-your-own-adventure, resource management, scrolling beat-'em-up' which I think pretty much covers everything. But damn, if it isn't so much more than the sum of its parts. I'm going to address one of the main quibbles about the game I've seen in other reviews: the difficulty. Some people have said it's too hard or that it's designed for co-op. Well, I won't deny it's a challenge, but for me, that can only be a good thing. I play with myself most of the time (stop giggling at the back!) and while there are certainly random elements that can scupper your plans, strategy and resource/item management do play a big role. (Hint: mechanics. They're the best). It never gets too frustrating, either, since each game session is not overly long. But that doesn't mean there isn't a lot to see - over a week of playing DRTC and I'm still seeing new encounters and meeting characters I've never met before. Overall, it's a very polished game with a sometimes-quirky, sometimes-childish sense of humour that you can't help but love all the more for it. If I had to make any complaints, I would say it would be nice if you could custom-create a cat or dog character.A few more custom options for the humans would be nice as well, if that's your thing. But cats and dogs are people, too.			"

												This... is addicting.Edit: I Just beat it in normal mode, it's quite challenging, it took me 19 hours, but I'm bad with videogames and I like to try every option... I wasted a lot of time.Positive:It's a real blast if you play with someone, and it increase the replayability if you are bored with some friend.A lot of funny characters that raised my curiosity and kept me playing, funny and rare events; I found a gennie trapped in a WC, an alien landing and a man in black with funny dialogs, a weirdo guy in fairy costume granting wishes ect.. After beating the normal mode, there are a lot of extra mode and I'm planning to beat a couple of them.Very catchy tune, It's just a game where you sit down and chill. You can create you own characters, with their own traits and perks, I made some friend in it and characters with various perks(perks can level up, 3 level in total) so I tried a lot of combinations, every game was diferent and when i lose, It doesn't feel like a punishment, making a new game exciting.Negative: The gameplay it's very simple and it's good but can make it repetitive.I don't know how it works, but sometimes it seems unfair, basically you need luck. Sometime is really hard to find suply, other times you have to much of it. Bad events in a row, or good events in a row.Only local 2 player max. You can make a team of 4 four peoples, but you can only play with one friend. IT'S A HUGE MISSOPORTUNITY. A game like this it's very party friendly. I had time when friends are just watching and taking turns for every game.Low variety of normal events. FOR GOD SAKE TO MUCH GOLF CAMPS IN MURICA.Rarely, the AI will take strange path to get with you, making it frustrating waiting them.(I know, very specifical) Overall:Worth my money. It's a casual game, just sit chill, relax and get some laugh of it. Replayable with co-op.Disclaimer: English is not my native lenguage, for those grammar nazis.			"

												So after deciding to not buy any more games this month, I stumbled upon Death Road to Canada (DR2C). I had never heard of this game before, but being a fan of the underrated indie gem Dead Pixels, FTL, Sheltered and roguelikes/lites in general, I went ahead and grabbed it at full price (15 bucks). Boy, oh boy. I don't regret this purchase one bit. Let me share my last and (so far) most successful run with you, as it might give you the gist of what this game is about._______________________________________I, a nurturing gun nut, and my buddy Steve Buscemi, who apparently is really good with a scalpel but also pretty depressed, started out somewhere in Florida. In our dinky old station wagon we decided to make the trip to Canada, because for some reason it's supposed to be the only zombie-free area in North America. After driving for three or four days, looting a few Y'all-Marts along the way, we came upon some red-haired hippie named Leonard. As it turns out, Leonard was a complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He just kinda tagged along without asking, fell asleep during watch and constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥talked the other survivors. He even farted at some point and blamed Steve for it (which dropped the latter's morale quite a bit). Because Leonard also sucked in a fight, I got killed during a dangerous situation in an abandoned factory. As the undead were busy violating my remains, Steve and Leonard got out unscathed. In an act of divine justice, that red-haired prick got attacked by a feral cat and died on the next scavenging run. Oh well, fewer mouths to feed for Steve, who - unsurprisingly - wasn't all that fazed by his sudden loss of Leonard. For the next two days, the Stevemeister went along all by himself, successfully fighting off a siege, making his way through an overcrowded tunnel and jacking a sweet SUV from a junkyard. Which is kinda surprising, because being a dedicated medic, he kind of sucked at anything combat-related. He then stumbled along the tiny, pony-tailed Angeline, a medic herself, and decided to take her along because hey, in the very worst case, she'd be live bait. In a most tragic turn of events, Steve turned out to be the bait during a late-night zombie siege in a log cabin close to the Canadian border. Angeline, fueled by anger over the loss of Mr. Pink, rampaged her way through the undead hordes, using a chainsaw, a hunting rifle and a shotgun. Now it was her turn to carry the torch to the north. But she had yet to face her most grueling challenge: an undead siege that went on for four hours, during which she killed approximately 150 zombies and which she miraculously survived without a scratch. At this point, our tiny badass medic could practically taste the poutine and Canada Dry. A bridge that was completely covered in walking corpses was all that separated her from Canada. Almost out of ammo, with her chainsaw running on fumes, she met her fate amongst a horde of approximately eighty zombies. Which kinda sucked, because with DR2C being a roguelite that means we had to start all over again.At least it's fun!			"

												This game is extremely fun. It's goofy and the humor is great, although I only have one issue with the game. Sieges are EXTREMELY difficult to go through. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I seriously always lose to these. I have put in 13 hours so far and have barely even made it to the half way mark to Canada. Regardless, I've had a lot of fun with the game. I'd say this game definitely was worth the $15, being one of the only games I've bought in the past couple of months that's clicked.EDIT: The difficulty is ridiculous. I've gotten to the point where I'm getting stressed playing this game, and can't say it's really my fancy. 33 hours and still haven't beaten it. Closest I've gotten is 5 days left, then I died in a siege. Like always. These sieges are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and super annoying.			"

												I want everyone, including developers, to know, that, as a cat person, I am personally OFFENDED, that this game missrepresents cats and promotes DOG SUPREMACY over other pet minorities. In this game dogs are portraited as distinct individuals with different character traits, while representation of cats is reduced to a single random event in which it behaves as a total♥♥♥♥♥♥ I wanted to play this game with my cat, but because of lack of characters to assotiate itself with, my cat won't even pick the controller.So my first suggestion to you is to recognize your canine privilage(which is nothing to be ashamed of), and include more feline characters with dveloped personalities in future updates.

												Let me recap my first real experience with this game.So I start off with my first two characters, Gert and Egg. As we drive from hell- er, Florida to Canada, we encounter something just along the border of Florida- and I'm not even kidding- a MAGICaL ANIME GIRL just plows through a horde of zombies with the power of weeb magic. ""You're kidding?"" I think to myself. Anyways, she's shoehorned into our adventure and we continue to raid an arcade and some houses and oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god she says the most ♥♥♥♥ing weeb♥♥♥♥♥♥ever when she attacks. Me being♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game and the controls being a little wonky to get used to (I'd recommend rebinding them to your personal preferences.), Gert dies. Egg is now leading our party of two and we somehow escape with ample supplies.Fast forward a couple ingame days and our party has grown to 4 members and we're pimpin out with guns and pipes in a Hybrid car after the old one♥♥♥♥♥♥itself but oh yeah we can't repair worth♥♥♥♥♥♥and the thing just so happens to be a damage magnet. Anime girl's face gets distorted as hell. What the ♥♥♥♥. No matter, let's just get our way through this shopping mart. Immediately after we hit the Death Road again, Anime girl ♥♥♥♥ing blows up in an explosion of kawaii weeb♥♥♥♥♥♥and now everyone is a hit away from death. But hey, at least we have guns and ammo now. We then get seiged in a cabin the size of a pencil point and I die fumbling around trying to get my guns back.Pretty cool game.			"

												There are certainly ups and downs to the game, like having the procedural map generation bone you at times or your team mates not pulling their own weight during a fight despite you telling them what you want them to do. These few grievances never seem to affect my gameplay however, as I usually find myself rising to the added challenge this presents for good or bad.My first play-through I didn't know what to expect, most of it is hard to differentiate between my many play-throughs since but I will never forget a particular moment where my group happened across a strange old woman running a bed & breakfast; there were a few choices I could choose from but none of them really beneficial so I decided to throw the dice and selected ""Say it don't spray it!"" expecting the absolute worse to follow. To my surprise the old woman not only gave us a place to stay for the night but fed us the next morning, after recovering from the initial shock I laughed out loud for a good minute before trailing off into sporadic chuckles while I continued my journey to Canada. I couldn't recommend this game enough to anyone who has a fondness for rogue-likes with a sense of humor and a nostalgic love for Oregon Trail.Extra Tip: If your vehicle is destroyed or runs out of gas and you don't want to lose your ammo (which might or might not happen until you find another vehicle) try loading up your character's inventory with as many guns of each ammo type as possible. I've found that you won't lose ammo if it's loaded into a gun and carried on your person, just be sure you put it back into your storage when you do get a vehicle or don't if you like to live dangerously.

												Fun game, I would buy it at this price. It is getting frequent updates, so each time you come back there will be something new. The one thing I don't like about the game is the RNG, I have terrible luck and even with a Sumo, Lunk and his M*ster Sword, a pug, and a fisherman I can't win. I lost health and got robbed and several hordes later, everyone died. I love this game, but until the RNG is fixed it is incredibly hard to win.			"

												This game really leans into bending you to the mercy of the RNG.  Maybe not in an entirely fair fashion, but then again this would be fine, but for the crashes.  Hopefully that is cleared up.  Once the crashing is fixed up, I will fully recommend this game.  Until then, buy at your own risk.That being said, ending zombies with an end table, or drawing feels really great.  Also the rare characters are very entertaining.			"

I like playing on the mode where funny things and characters can pop up making the game easier, or NOT. in my case i almost won with a lucky encouter that made me almost win. its fun to loot and try to aviod zomibes and the game has a good sense of humor. the controlls arent bad and are simple and there are some gliches but its becuase the dev team is small and i think they went through a lot making this game, i think. whatever you do dont switch weapons in the middle of a fight other wise it kicks you out due to a SUPER BUG. Even the bad things that happen like sieges are fun and keep the game exiting its diffucult and i love playing it. I HOPE this game becomes a classic becasuse good inde games are under a layer of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.maybe next time i will give up and live the rest of my days happy			"

												Death Road to CanadaGame is fun, funny and technically endless as you and your team trek from the wastes of Florida to bristling perfection that is Canada in the zambi alpacalyspe.Throughout your journey you must maintain proper fuel levels, car damage, food, and the health of your survivors by exploring randomly genereated towns full of the undead and rest stops that allow you to buy and loot supplies and weapons to use or trade. There are random events with skill checks and also little hidden events in towns to help boost ratings for your travelers. Comabt is simple and addicting, however knowing when to run is often a critical choice. Side note: kiting skills are a plus. You can also create your own team of survivors, equip them with certain professions and skill sets like Pistoleer- Good with pistols, or Car nut - Bonus mechanic stats. You can take up to 2 of them to start the game and hope to run into the other on your journey to canada. Your teammates can leave you depending on their stats so be careful of who you choose, or they can bring your morale down if they are annoying or a whiner.The games old 16bit feel is welcoming and is good for a quick periods of gaming. My only gripe is that the events arent as vaired as I'd like but that is very fixable with patches and more writing from the dev team. All in all good game to play.			"

Sadly, it was only a matter of time before even Starla was overcome by a horde that appeared while she was scavenging a junkyard.8/10 It's like Organ Trail but different, with more emphasis on action and character relationships and stats.

												Been playing this game with a friend (CRAZY!) and it is definitely one of the best I've ever played.Various examples of why this game is awesome:1. Design, name and encounter/recruit custom characters e.g. Johnny 'Big Hands' and Ricky 'lil' fingers'.2. Recruit famous people.3. Recruit clowns.4. Random events such as recruiting clowns and famous people.5. Other random events that I don't want to spoil because they're so FREAKIN' ORESOME!6. General gameplay mechanics are solid and well though out, the strategic elements both before heading into a town and while in a town are perfectly executed, keeping the player on her toes.7. The Soundtrack is sublime (Great work Joey Grady) and can be bought from here: https://joeygrady.bandcamp.com/album/death-road-to-canada-ostThe rogue elements keep it feeling very fresh and even after nearly 20 hours of playing, things still happen that I haven't seen before or even expect. Even though there are lots of random things that occur, I've never felt cheated as a player and the balance feels just right. It's an incredibly funny, ridiculous game that is an absolute joy to play.Buy it, I stake my reputation on it*.*I have no reputation but it's a great game and people will be better off for having played it.

I've had plays where it's been dire the entire time and then go all up easy street toward Canada. I've even had runs where its been great the entire time and then I suddenly die from a wrong turn. It does keep me on my toes.Pros - Great sound, easy controls, great dialogue, different game modes, create your friends as NPC's and play a ""friends only"" game, local co-op, you meet neat special characters (like a guy who reminds me of a fellow from Half-Life)Cons - Game could turn a 180 to mess you up (1 in 5 is the chance of getting messed up)			"

												Death Road To Canada is a special kind of frustrating.It's unfair. It constantly ♥♥♥♥s you over and many of your losses will be completely down to RNG. You'll feel powerless to help as the game throws more food than you'd ever need at you yet neglects to give you any fuel whatsoever. You'll take a deep sigh as the game pits you against swarms of unrelenting hordes armed with a human femur, yet I'm strangely ok with it.Simply put, Death Road To Canada is the kind of game where I don't mind losing because of all the crazy stories I'll get out of the experience. If you go in expecting something tough but fair like FTL you'll be screaming at your monitor in anger but if you simply go in to create your friends, family and Persian leaders circa 423-404 BC and watch as everything goes horribly, horribly wrong you'll be laughing through the pain.For example, I had a party of myself, a friend, Emperor Palpatine and a dog we found on the way named Milo. During a raid of a mostly empty house Palpatine decided now was the time to use that molotov he'd been saving in a small hallway which I had been standing in. Myself and my friend were burnt to a crisp and it was up to Palpatine and his dog to carry on our legacy.They died when he told an armed bandit to cool it.At 15€ the game feels a tad overpriced what with games like the aforementioned FTL being only €10 which I'd argue have much more replayability and depth but on the whole I'd reccomend Death Road To Canada as a fun little game to toy around in every now and then.

												I have a hard time explaining why I love this game. On paper, the gameplay loop sounded shallow to me at first, but here I am having played 12 hours of the game and still very much enjoying my time with it.I think it's the allure of just waiting for the next crazy thing to happen. Also I love games that have a custom character creator. It's just so much fun to watch yourself and your friends die terribly or blame each other for farting in the car.Also, the game is still getting updated fairly regularly. I love games that aren't in early access so that they're fleshed out and playable, yet still get nice quality of life updates.Onward to Canada!			"

												Its fun and challenging. Music is great and completely changes how the game feels giving it more of a comical feel even as you get eaten by zombies. Its a rouge game so everything is always new unless you save your characters in which atleast they would be the same. It plays a lot like oregon trail mixed with exploring so dont be suprised if you dont make it through your first run, or maybe you will i don't know how good or lucky you will get. Anyway great game 8/10 will play again.			"

												This is the story of Old Man Phillip:Old Man saw a lady by the name of Elv on his way to canada, who he decided to bring along with him in support and hopefully as bait i the situation was dire.they scouted a few areas and for a while it was just the two of them gathering supplies.Then they met the one, the one man(?) who would become the legend of the road, and a legend to tell for years.... the man known as Octodad.Octodad was fierce and clever, he healed the teammates with upmost skill, cleared zombies using only a metal pipe and a pistol, ignored bees with an iron resistance, and was the best damn scavenger the world had ever known.one night, it was raining particularly bad and the group decided to pull over at a house, having 55 food, 75 gas, and tons of bullets, not to mention a gas effecient car, the group was ready for anything.then it happened, a siege in the middle of the night, being completely outnumbered by the massive horde, the three heroes ran into the kitchen, they took out what few zombies were in there with ease, but another problem arose.the zombies gathered outside the kitchen in a huge pack, not willing to enter, but not willing to leave.this showdown lasted for hours to see who would break first, at 11:00 at night, phillip stood up with his nightstick and said ""We have no other choice""Elv tried to reason with him to see if they could hold up just a little bit longer, after arguing for a little bit the choice was left to Octodad.arming his metal pipe Octodad burbled out a confident agreement, it was now or never.Old Man Phillip burst from the room and swatted a zombie on the head with his nightstick, killing it instantly. That was all the horde needed to begin their attack. Old Man Phillip ran back into the kitchen as the zombies poured in. they stvied to fight off the zombies until Old Man Phillip saw an opening .""This way!"" He shouted as he ran out of the room. fighting off more zombies, he reached the exit's doorknob when he realized something. nether Elv or Octodad had followed him out.Gunshots erupted from the kitchen, and outburst Octodad.The horde had surrounded the exit to the kitchen and there was no way out for Octodad, switching from his pistol to his AK-47. Octodad took one last look over the horde to see Old Man Phillip still holding on to the doorknob, looking on in horror at the potential fate of Octodad.Octodad shook his head, It was better that Phillip survive than them both die in a foolish fate of playing hero.Phillip only stayed for a moment as rapid gunshots rang out in the house. bursting outside, Phillip reached the cars doorknob, started the car and drove.for a while, he could still hear the gunshots down the road, but eventually they stopped.not long after, the border of canada was in the distance, Old Man Phillip had did it. But in the end, he lost the one man who made it all possible.10/10 would be sad again.			"

												This is one of those games which makes me with for a middle-ground button. The game is simplistic and arcade like in nature, but runs into trouble with length and quite frankly awful RNG.   A full playthrough could run you a solid 2 hours.  You encounter a range of characters with different useful abilities.  Virtually all of these abilities will come to task at some point during your road trip meaning unless you have a well rounded team then expect failure.  It seems like this game sets you up to fail half the time.  Run out of gas?  Well expect your entire teams morall, health, and supplies to get obliterated as mishap and bandit tax you 4-5 times before reaching a new car.    A zero mistake run could be completely and utterly wrecked by the game's siege mode with an hour+ of the game stolen from you.  At the very least siege mode needs to be tweaked where the zombies have less then normal health.It's all a real shame because this game has a lot to offer, but I'll likely stop playing after my frist RNG enabled win.

												Someone farted in the car. Game asked me who to defuse the car full of irritated survivors. Picked my leader. She somehow explained the whole thing away by deducing that a ghost did it.I think I about died laughing that day.But seriously, DRtC is a brilliantly done game. Well thought out action game mechanics, AI that is, overall, better than one would expect for a game like this, and a tough but fair ""simulation"" for non-combat situations.Top that off with great music, great pixel graphics and absolute hilarity in some of the events, and you've got what is easily one of my favorite games this year.If someone asked me to rate this game with something tangible, like, say, a number, I'd rate it [a dog driving a car] out of [a maple leaf].

												Started with a partner. We looted a Ya'll Mart; I smashed zombie heads with a cricket bat while she covered me with a shotgun. We rescued a luchador and janitor at a few more stops. We found a UFO. Alien taught me to drive it and ran away. I couldn't get it past a bush in the way. My whole group died while I tried to destroy that bush. I died shortly after finding a muscle car at a gas station. Jumped right back in to a second game. Basically Oregon/Organ Trail mixed with river city ransom. Awesome and highly recommended. A pleasant surprise for purchasing it right at launch. 12/10 would destroy bush again			"

												Death Road to Canada is an overwhelmingly fun homage to the Oregon Trail (or more accurately the Organ Trail). I bought it on a whim due to the art style and zombies, as I have a soft spot for these types of games, and I honestly couldn't be more in love with it. The game is funny, original, creative, interesting, and above all else it's hard as hell. You face some serious challenges on the death road, and it takes a really long time before you're even competent enough to reach the final days leading up to Canada. On top of that, the sound track is absurdly catchy, to the point where I find myself going around my daily life whistling or humming to the music that's in this game. This is all without even mentioning the fun I've had playing this couch coop. I only picked up the game two weeks ago shortly after its release on steam, but my friends and I have taken every opportunity possible to meet up at my place and get as far as we can. We still haven't even beaten the game once, possibly because we're terrible, but more likely because the game is just that challenging, and that's something I simply love.If you are the kind of person who enjoys rogue-like games with difficult but rewarding gameplay, or if you're just looking for a good game to hang out with some friends and play, then this is a great choice for you.I give Death Road to Canada a 9/10.

												Ecnountered a super OP Kawaii Magical Animu Girl on my trek that shouts kawaii emoticons and senpai related stuff when killing zombies. 19/17.In all seriousness, this game is fun, wacky, and chock full of surprises like the one above. You can create your own survivors and have them meet you and fight and die with you XCOM style, Fast paced gameplay that basically says ""If you stop moving, you're dead."" Death means deleted save file so no save scumming, All while chiptuned Ragtime is playing in the background. I'm having a ton of fun so far and I've barely even scratched the surface of it. If I had to complain about something, there are no resolution options, and the resolution given is quite terrible. Is it aesthetic reasons? Probably, (It's made to look like somthing on an old TV, or a movie from like the 40s, film grain, scratches and all [Which can be turned off btw]) But it completely messes with the Steam Overlay and makes Screenshots absolutely tiny.  I can recommend it, however, It's not really for everyone. That being said, if this goes on sale for like, 5-10$, definitely give it a look. Also, the game is balls hard. Just thought I'd let people know.			"

												Death Road to Canada is a fun but difficult little zombified version of Oregon Trail with added action elements. Each playthrough will have you pitted against difficult choices while also providing you a plethora of options to handle the various situations - some of which based on the traits and characteristics of your crew! With a handful of special characters, as well as an option to create 2d respresentations of your friends who can join your team in game, this will definitely eat up dozens of hours for the Rogue-Lite enthusiasts!

												I want everyone, including developers, to know, that, as a cat person, I am personally OFFENDED, that this game missrepresents cats and promotes DOG SUPREMACY over other pet minorities. In this game dogs are portraited as distinct individuals with different character traits, while representation of cats is reduced to a single random event in which it behaves as a total♥♥♥♥♥♥ I wanted to play this game with my cat, but because of lack of characters to assotiate itself with, my cat won't even pick the controller.So my first suggestion to you is to recognize your canine privilage(which is nothing to be ashamed of), and include more feline characters with dveloped personalities in future updates.

												Death Road to CanadaGame is fun, funny and technically endless as you and your team trek from the wastes of Florida to bristling perfection that is Canada in the zambi alpacalyspe.Throughout your journey you must maintain proper fuel levels, car damage, food, and the health of your survivors by exploring randomly genereated towns full of the undead and rest stops that allow you to buy and loot supplies and weapons to use or trade. There are random events with skill checks and also little hidden events in towns to help boost ratings for your travelers. Comabt is simple and addicting, however knowing when to run is often a critical choice. Side note: kiting skills are a plus. You can also create your own team of survivors, equip them with certain professions and skill sets like Pistoleer- Good with pistols, or Car nut - Bonus mechanic stats. You can take up to 2 of them to start the game and hope to run into the other on your journey to canada. Your teammates can leave you depending on their stats so be careful of who you choose, or they can bring your morale down if they are annoying or a whiner.The games old 16bit feel is welcoming and is good for a quick periods of gaming. My only gripe is that the events arent as vaired as I'd like but that is very fixable with patches and more writing from the dev team. All in all good game to play.			"

												There are certainly ups and downs to the game, like having the procedural map generation bone you at times or your team mates not pulling their own weight during a fight despite you telling them what you want them to do. These few grievances never seem to affect my gameplay however, as I usually find myself rising to the added challenge this presents for good or bad.My first play-through I didn't know what to expect, most of it is hard to differentiate between my many play-throughs since but I will never forget a particular moment where my group happened across a strange old woman running a bed & breakfast; there were a few choices I could choose from but none of them really beneficial so I decided to throw the dice and selected ""Say it don't spray it!"" expecting the absolute worse to follow. To my surprise the old woman not only gave us a place to stay for the night but fed us the next morning, after recovering from the initial shock I laughed out loud for a good minute before trailing off into sporadic chuckles while I continued my journey to Canada. I couldn't recommend this game enough to anyone who has a fondness for rogue-likes with a sense of humor and a nostalgic love for Oregon Trail.Extra Tip: If your vehicle is destroyed or runs out of gas and you don't want to lose your ammo (which might or might not happen until you find another vehicle) try loading up your character's inventory with as many guns of each ammo type as possible. I've found that you won't lose ammo if it's loaded into a gun and carried on your person, just be sure you put it back into your storage when you do get a vehicle or don't if you like to live dangerously.

Tons of fun, definitely recommend it for people who like awesome music, humor, and just plain ole' zombie murder.			"

												If you're interested at all, you should at least watch a video. This game is great. Usually don't do reviews, but the game deserves more recognition.Basically it's oregon trail, with FTL choice options affected by your teams stats. Light RPG elements. Light resource management. And a real time scavenging / combat with a dumb-AI squad every couple of minutes. The combat is basic, but it's still fun. The main draw is the story of all the great / horrible things that happen to your guys on the road. You can create a pool of custom characters that you find. This is highly reccomended. Makes the journey personal and enhances the humor in that sims sort of way when your characters drop everything and decide to go mini golfing. This might, if someone on your squard has a bad attitude stat, backfire and result in Stacey throwing the ball to ruin the game (typical Stacey). You might find your team squabbling over a lone candy bar, or deciding whether or not to shack up at a creepy old lady's ""inn"". Then your friend Bill starts Obama-bashing in the car.Pros:-Looks polished, the retro graphics don't feel like a cheap shortcut-Good music / sfx, if slightlyyyyy repetitive. But only slightly. Zombies have a nice SQUISH.-Humor is on point. The game strikes a great tone of lightheartedness. The ""full tilt random"" stuff is just rare enough to be exciting. But they do have a mode where all that gets cranked up if it's more your style. The base game itself is more restrained than the trailer will have you believe, but I'd say that's a good thing.-Every run is different. It's even fun to die and start over.-One month in, Devs still balancing and adding a few things.-Suprising number of zombies on screen.-2 player couch coop, shared screen. Haven't tried it yet, but I've heard it's ""okay"" if a little buggy.Cons:-Perks are a bit unbalanced. For instance, paranoid and mechanic are VERY good at the moment. Some are pretty lame.-No online or lan multi- but for this price point it's not bad. Devs are planning split screen supposedly.-Some AI pathing issues / bugs might result in death. But after it happens once or twice you can avoid it.-No info about weapons in the game, just named. Which is better, the axe or sledgehammer? How much strength till I'm not penalized for using it? What makes this hockey stick ""X-treme"" over the regular one? Beats me. Not going to sit in an empty room to test and do the math on randomized dmg, cooldown time, stamina use, and the impact 2 seperate stats have on it all.-Your AI squad guy might find a grenade early on. He might hold it for the entire game in his inventory lulling you into a false sense of security; just obediently holding it for you to use later. Then he will suddenly have the urge to throw it at a zombie 1 foot away on the last level, killing your entire team in one shot even though you were fully decked out in some great gear. (STILL SALTY).Overall, great game. 15 bucks? Do it.			"

												I was on one of my many DEATH ROADS to Canada.I was with a friend, his name was Solid Snake. He didn't last long however. It had seemed hopeless... It was not long before I have met a sumo wrestler on the side of the road, while he was sumo wrestling zombies to the ground. It was my decision to allow him to join my team.I couple of days later, we found this Garfield fur suit in the hallways of a high school. When we touched it, the ""thing"" yelled ""I FRICKIN HATE MONDAYS!""  Then we allowed it to join our team, with it's name being G*** but we just called him Garfunkle.Garfunkle was the smartest of our team, little did we realize that Garfunkle would be the end of us.Like one time, we were spying on a town that was booby trapped and we decided on Garfunkle to retrieve the supplies. And he came back with loot that would last us many days. And another were he ""foresaw"" the Bandits that were about to attack us, but then we counter ambushed them.But it was one night that things changed forever...The group was sitting around a campfire around a camp site. We were telling stories to pass the time, while Garfunkle was looking off into the distance. A lightning storm was brewing as Garfunkle turned around and stared at us. As he took off his fur mask, lightning roared from the heavens as he said ""THIS IS WHY I HATE MONDAYS.""At that moment, zombies surrounded the group. With no hope of escaping, we fought to our last breaths. Frisk our team mate was eaten alive in front of me, While the sumo wrestler threw a grenade to try to ease her from her pain. But it was hopless. Then the zombies started to surround the sumo wrestler, as he was now the hunted.With my shotgun in hand, I tried fighting off the zombies. but I quickly ran out of ammo and was stuck with my baseball bat, thats when the zombies started to eat me alive the last thing I saw was Garfunkle's creepy smile looking at me. As I wondered if this was not the first group he had done this too...			"

You must enter a roadtrip through hell with your group of custom survivors (either randomly generated, or personalized) along the death road leading to Canada.Along the way you must collect resource, fuel, medical supplies, and allies, or your going to die.Each character is unique having their strong points and weak, which is evident in combat and various choices you must make along the road, which could very well decide your fate.Strap on your Cowboy Rifle, and grab a kitchen knife, because It's this game is kill or be killed.

												When I purchasced this game I had this strange feeling I was going to end up refunding it but I was very wrong. The game is very akin to Oregon Trail like many others have said with some playable sections where you loot and kill zombies taking place between all the text events. The combat isn't revolutionary but it feels good and there is more than one way to come at the zombies and it allows you the player some flexibility in your choice, something rare for a ""indie zombie"" game which typically are just cash grabs. The game is also brutal. Like unbelievably unforgiving when it comes to mistakes and just plain old random encounters. You might get have a full health team and then get 3 ""lose health"" random events in a row and have everyone die. It's not frustrating at least for me as the game is definitely designed for multiple play throughs and constant restarting. Though I would definitely not suggest this game to anyone who isn't of the mindset of ""losing is fun"".There is a lot of great humor in the game as well as tons of easter eggs and pop culture references.  The events will probably begin to get repetitive at some point, but I certainly haven’t reached that point yet. You are also given extensive customization of your character as well as the ability to have a ""folder"" of custom characters you can meet throughout the game in addition to the ones already in.The music is hilariously (in a good way) out of place, but it's still very well made and catchy. And even though I say it’s out of place it's by no way ""awkward"" it's just not what you would expect, but it still works. The pixel art is beautifully retro and the game also has a old western movie film grain over it (which you can disable if you'd like).For things I didn't like, the controls felt atrocious for me, I just couldn't play with them. You are allowed to rebind and there is controller support, which is what I found was the best way to play. The options menu is also pretty barebones, only allowing you to change from full screen and windowed (which was stuck at one resolution) and adjusting the volume levels. I also found myself trying to move in certain locations only to find it was blocked by an invisible wall, but that was minor and probably a result of the ""top down"" view. Overall though, definitely a worthy purchase for only $15. A cute little indie zombie game with a great sense of humor, a hefty amount of content and a clear amount of love in the mix as well.			"

												great game. my only complaints are two things: there is no online multiplayer, and a melee playstyle is not that viable. to make melee better you can implent selling items to traders. I find myself having an excess of ammo and finding a lot of guns, but not able to use them at all since i had picked the martial artist perk (doesnt allow you use guns).edit: this game is  really hard to beat even on normal and with guns (undoubtedly the best way to kill zombies). i feel like the only way to beat normal is just play and lose a lot  until you level up your perks, but then that brings into question how will you beat harder gamemodes?

												Zombie games are one thing.Roguelikes are another. Together they form an amazing game!I personally found out about this game after watching some youtubers play it, and I haven't put it down since. This addictive rougelike quickly became one of my most played steam game of all time. Throughout the game you'll find yourself making custom characters and using them to create a dream team that has to brave it to Canada. After picking a team you must hoard food, gas, some food, medicine, more food, bullets, and even more food. And then tough it out in your SUV/hot dog car/dog van until you get to Canada, occasionally running into new friends. One adventure could go something like this.--------(beware spoilerish thing [a few scenarios kind of spoiled, if you want to go in completely blind just skip this])------Your character starts and gets supplies, normal day right?No, you soon meet a gnome riding a rat. He seems nice so you invite him to join.Then you meet a dog wearing a trench coat. He joins your team to.But then you accidently leave him behind in a raid :(Afterward you see a sasquatch.Then break into a twinkie truck, and go on an entirely twinkie based diet.You die shortly afterwards Dang it!-----(spoilerish thing over)----------------------Seriously, buy this game. It's challenging, hilarious, and generally really good.  "

With each death you find a new stratagy and it urges you to keep going.Worth every penny.			"

												Death road to Canada is a very enjoyable game which is easy to play during spare time.The best things about DRTC is how unpredictable it is with wildly varying results with what will happen during your run. So many different events can happen which can make or break your journey to Canada. Eveytime I die it gets me a bit frustrated but makes me want to play to find out even more!!Also Rocketcat games are very in-touch with the community which is great to see!The things I dislike about this game is how similar some of the buildings. It gets quite repetitive to see the same things when you've done several runs. Also online multiplyer does not exist yet which is a little disappointing.Overall this game has great replayability and most of the events and rare characters are great fun! You can see from the other reviews how ridiculous (in a good way) some of the other people's runs are! At only £11 at full price this game is most definitely worth buying.			"

												I would definitly recommend this to anyone. It's a modern take on Oregon Trail where anything can happen at anytime. I've had plays where it's been dire the entire time and then go all up easy street toward Canada. I've even had runs where its been great the entire time and then I suddenly die from a wrong turn. It does keep me on my toes.Pros - Great sound, easy controls, great dialogue, different game modes, create your friends as NPC's and play a ""friends only"" game, local co-op, you meet neat special characters (like a guy who reminds me of a fellow from Half-Life)Cons - Game could turn a 180 to mess you up (1 in 5 is the chance of getting messed up)			"

												Fun, well thought out game with a lot of replay value. I've seen some negative reviews for the game sometimes being impossible due to lack of fuel to find, however I feel like that is standard for the genre and it all depends on what choices we make. Finding things like fuel and weapons, is always meant to be luck, and risk reward. Anyone who has played FTL on hard knows its often impossible to win to. Sometimes things just don't go your way. I would recommend this game to people who likes any of the following. FTL, Convoy, Organ Trail, Bad dudes etc..			"

												Death Road To Canada is a special kind of frustrating.It's unfair. It constantly ♥♥♥♥s you over and many of your losses will be completely down to RNG. You'll feel powerless to help as the game throws more food than you'd ever need at you yet neglects to give you any fuel whatsoever. You'll take a deep sigh as the game pits you against swarms of unrelenting hordes armed with a human femur, yet I'm strangely ok with it.Simply put, Death Road To Canada is the kind of game where I don't mind losing because of all the crazy stories I'll get out of the experience. If you go in expecting something tough but fair like FTL you'll be screaming at your monitor in anger but if you simply go in to create your friends, family and Persian leaders circa 423-404 BC and watch as everything goes horribly, horribly wrong you'll be laughing through the pain.For example, I had a party of myself, a friend, Emperor Palpatine and a dog we found on the way named Milo. During a raid of a mostly empty house Palpatine decided now was the time to use that molotov he'd been saving in a small hallway which I had been standing in. Myself and my friend were burnt to a crisp and it was up to Palpatine and his dog to carry on our legacy.They died when he told an armed bandit to cool it.At 15€ the game feels a tad overpriced what with games like the aforementioned FTL being only €10 which I'd argue have much more replayability and depth but on the whole I'd reccomend Death Road To Canada as a fun little game to toy around in every now and then.

												Death Road to Canada is an amazing game. On top of it's amazing humor and charming pixel graphics, the fun and engaging gameplay always keeping me coming back for more. A lot of the fun comes from never knowing whats gonna happen on the Death Road next. You can find  Jason Mason with his machete and amazing strength, as well as a fairy queen, an exploding anime girl, a  A TOO SWOLE TO CONTROL bodybuilder, a sumo wrestler, the famous mexican luchador El Satan, and even a totally normal old cat lady.The game's music is also amazing, giving you that old arcade vibe that blends with the graphics and gameplay very nicely. Take a listen here!:https://joeygrady.bandcamp.com/album/death-road-to-canada-ostThe game even has an local co-op mode at the moment. In later updates, splitscreen, four-player mode, and even potentially online play will be in the coming future.All in all, this is a great game and you should definitely a game you should check it out!

												This game, although expensive, is definitely worth the price. If you like zombie games, or want some but aren't old enough, Death Road to Canada is a perfect game for you! With pixely graphics, blood and gore is still expressed however not as over the top. The way it runs is fantastic too, and the challenge makes it even more exciting.You can create your own characters, then find them and recruit them to your team in-game. They can have different abilities and weapons, so you can swap between them depending on what quest/mission you're on.The game itself, too, is really funny and so many different things can happen to alter the future of that session's gameplay, which is one key to having a good RPG game.5/5			"

												Let me recap my first real experience with this game.So I start off with my first two characters, Gert and Egg. As we drive from hell- er, Florida to Canada, we encounter something just along the border of Florida- and I'm not even kidding- a MAGICaL ANIME GIRL just plows through a horde of zombies with the power of weeb magic. ""You're kidding?"" I think to myself. Anyways, she's shoehorned into our adventure and we continue to raid an arcade and some houses and oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god she says the most ♥♥♥♥ing weeb♥♥♥♥♥♥ever when she attacks. Me being♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game and the controls being a little wonky to get used to (I'd recommend rebinding them to your personal preferences.), Gert dies. Egg is now leading our party of two and we somehow escape with ample supplies.Fast forward a couple ingame days and our party has grown to 4 members and we're pimpin out with guns and pipes in a Hybrid car after the old one♥♥♥♥♥♥itself but oh yeah we can't repair worth♥♥♥♥♥♥and the thing just so happens to be a damage magnet. Anime girl's face gets distorted as hell. What the ♥♥♥♥. No matter, let's just get our way through this shopping mart. Immediately after we hit the Death Road again, Anime girl ♥♥♥♥ing blows up in an explosion of kawaii weeb♥♥♥♥♥♥and now everyone is a hit away from death. But hey, at least we have guns and ammo now. We then get seiged in a cabin the size of a pencil point and I die fumbling around trying to get my guns back.Pretty cool game.			"

												Why aren't you playing this game right now, you DINK! Only Dinks don't play this game!Seriously, this game is endless amount of fun. Solid zombie wacking and looting gameplay mixed with a ""Oregan Road"" travel system. Injected with so much popculture refrence and jokes and easter eggs and wacky encounters, also, you'll learn new curse words. This game is definetly worth the asking price. Play this game.You DINK!

												Death Road to Canada is a really good and fun game but it's INSANELY HARD! It's a pixelised survival game where you take control of a group of survivors that want to go to Canada because it's a safe place in the zombie infested world. You manage food, gas, ammo and the car. There's random events where it's hard to come out of it without any damage like bandits taking all your food and ammo or you get hurt. I found myself dying alot 5 to 7 days of driving to arrive to Canada. Fun things that this game have is that you can create characters. So you can make you, your family and your friends and try to survive! There's also a offline multiplayer so you can play with your friends (I highly reccomand it because sometime the CPU can suicide...) Anyway this game is a blast to play if you like challenging games.			"

												Death road to Canada is a very enjoyable game which is easy to play during spare time.The best things about DRTC is how unpredictable it is with wildly varying results with what will happen during your run. So many different events can happen which can make or break your journey to Canada. Eveytime I die it gets me a bit frustrated but makes me want to play to find out even more!!Also Rocketcat games are very in-touch with the community which is great to see!The things I dislike about this game is how similar some of the buildings. It gets quite repetitive to see the same things when you've done several runs. Also online multiplyer does not exist yet which is a little disappointing.Overall this game has great replayability and most of the events and rare characters are great fun! You can see from the other reviews how ridiculous (in a good way) some of the other people's runs are! At only £11 at full price this game is most definitely worth buying.			"

												I think that this game is very well put together, I love the character customization and how you can make your own NPCs. I played this game for a while and I love how funny it is, you could play as Elvis and shake hands with Death himself only to find a magic anime girl in a cabin (yes, all of which is possible) I also like the choice options and random events, it really makes it so you have to plan for almost anything to happen, be it good or bad. The fact that survivors can betray, steal, or even KILL you is very challenging too because you need to make sure that their morale is high. Skills are very important and I love how you can improve them and how you can lose them. If you're looking for a good zombie game that can be scary, funny, challenging, or all at once, then this is a game for you...			"

												I was on one of my many DEATH ROADS to Canada.I was with a friend, his name was Solid Snake. He didn't last long however. It had seemed hopeless... It was not long before I have met a sumo wrestler on the side of the road, while he was sumo wrestling zombies to the ground. It was my decision to allow him to join my team.I couple of days later, we found this Garfield fur suit in the hallways of a high school. When we touched it, the ""thing"" yelled ""I FRICKIN HATE MONDAYS!""  Then we allowed it to join our team, with it's name being G*** but we just called him Garfunkle.Garfunkle was the smartest of our team, little did we realize that Garfunkle would be the end of us.Like one time, we were spying on a town that was booby trapped and we decided on Garfunkle to retrieve the supplies. And he came back with loot that would last us many days. And another were he ""foresaw"" the Bandits that were about to attack us, but then we counter ambushed them.But it was one night that things changed forever...The group was sitting around a campfire around a camp site. We were telling stories to pass the time, while Garfunkle was looking off into the distance. A lightning storm was brewing as Garfunkle turned around and stared at us. As he took off his fur mask, lightning roared from the heavens as he said ""THIS IS WHY I HATE MONDAYS.""At that moment, zombies surrounded the group. With no hope of escaping, we fought to our last breaths. Frisk our team mate was eaten alive in front of me, While the sumo wrestler threw a grenade to try to ease her from her pain. But it was hopless. Then the zombies started to surround the sumo wrestler, as he was now the hunted.With my shotgun in hand, I tried fighting off the zombies. but I quickly ran out of ammo and was stuck with my baseball bat, thats when the zombies started to eat me alive the last thing I saw was Garfunkle's creepy smile looking at me. As I wondered if this was not the first group he had done this too...			"

												This game is fantastic.Although I've never made it to Canada, I feel I got my money's worth. What a lot of these reviews are neglecting to mention though is that this game is a fantastic story generator.It's almost impossible not to get attached to these characters you meet and give them backstories, interactions and lore in your head, it's also a great in-joke creator, due to it's very fun (although problamatic) couch co-op mode.This game is absolutely worth the purchase, and there are nearly constant updates that almost always ad new content(if you weren't already convinced).It's definetely my 2016 Game of the year and I absolutely reccomend it!

												This game, although expensive, is definitely worth the price. If you like zombie games, or want some but aren't old enough, Death Road to Canada is a perfect game for you! With pixely graphics, blood and gore is still expressed however not as over the top. The way it runs is fantastic too, and the challenge makes it even more exciting.You can create your own characters, then find them and recruit them to your team in-game. They can have different abilities and weapons, so you can swap between them depending on what quest/mission you're on.The game itself, too, is really funny and so many different things can happen to alter the future of that session's gameplay, which is one key to having a good RPG game.5/5			"

												Very fun first round playing. Like many other reviewers I ended up with a dog as the sole survivor of larger party, who then began a solitary drive to Canada. The dog learned kung-fu that allowed me to attack in any direction rather then the standard left and right. Nearly made it to Canada but died in a museum that I was lured to because of flashy text.Controls feel floaty and limited at first, with only 2 effective directions to attack. Dogs have sharper control but can't use weapons at first. Great storytelling ability, amazing local co-op potential with 4 player splitscreen to come mabye next update.			"

												Death Road to Canada is an amazing game. On top of it's amazing humor and charming pixel graphics, the fun and engaging gameplay always keeping me coming back for more. A lot of the fun comes from never knowing whats gonna happen on the Death Road next. You can find  Jason Mason with his machete and amazing strength, as well as a fairy queen, an exploding anime girl, a  A TOO SWOLE TO CONTROL bodybuilder, a sumo wrestler, the famous mexican luchador El Satan, and even a totally normal old cat lady.The game's music is also amazing, giving you that old arcade vibe that blends with the graphics and gameplay very nicely. Take a listen here!:https://joeygrady.bandcamp.com/album/death-road-to-canada-ostThe game even has an local co-op mode at the moment. In later updates, splitscreen, four-player mode, and even potentially online play will be in the coming future.All in all, this is a great game and you should definitely a game you should check it out!

You can go from near death experiences to challenging bandits to a pose off, then face dilemmas such as who farted in the car?With so many different events, you're bound to find something (or someone) you've never seen before, for a long time. I still occasionally find new events and outcomes even now!			"

												Some games are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. And this is one of those games.What I'm getting at is that this game is replayable. To a frankly absurd degree. The writing and events put into the game show a creative team that really is just having fun with the absurdity that they induce.Adding facsimiles of people in custom characters is great as well. The engine for this is limited, but it is functional.To be fair though, it is a fairly straightforward game though. A simple one, at least. But from an Indie game, I think that's a fair expectation.			"

												 I LOVE this game! You should know going in that, much like it's obvious inspiration Oregon Trail, the game is heavy on the RNG, and a perfectly good run can fall apart out of nowhere. But similarly, a disastrous run can sometimes recover in miraculous ways. Of course, I'm biased towards any game that lets me make so many characters and have them show up in your game.It's a positive and goofy spin on the zombie genre, which is far too often full of dark, depressing, and heavy-handed games.

												My friend was playing DRTC a lot and told me about the custom characters and how fun it was, so I thought I would give it a try during the holiday sale and I wasn't disappointed. It was a really fun game, especially if the devs will be willing to support it in the future. My only complaints is there should be more customization options and the ability to create female characters that are as tall as the males.I love the random events, they're reminiscent of Oregon Trail, so if you love that kind of randomize in a fun hack n slash zombie genre, you are in for a real treat. You really do make choices that matter or that gamble with your safety as a leader, and I can see all the detail that went into putting this project together.			"

												Bought this game yesterday and with less than an hour of play time I have already failed, My group consisted of 2 people they drove around collecting supplies for a bit when somebody else joined, continued collecting supplies for a bit until car ran out of fuel and had to be abandoned, robbed some helples traders then lost a member during a fight with zombies, immideatly after that my group hit the road again and took shelter in the woods were a bear attacked and I could only take food or ammo, Not wanting to leave anything behind I decided they should fight the bear. They both died.			"

This game is REALLY hard, rng will f*ck you so hard in the a$$ it hurts, many times a good run will get ruined by one bad roll of the dice. But hey?

												I've only got a few hours played of this game but it is a very unique experience compared to the mass of other zombie related titles out there. as many other reviews have stated this game comes across like Oregon trail in a modern zombie apocalypse. with different game modes you can range from the semi realistic approach and even make friends and family to include as characters you can recruit in your party. or you can have a playthrough where you can get murderous clowns, a link alternative, a sailor moon knockoff and anything in between. the game is great at not taking itself too seriously especially with some of the travel banter between characters. gameplay while simplistic is a lot of fun. theres something satisfying about hulking out and throwing a couch at a horde of zombies and knocking them all down either for the get away or an easy cleanup. the game does have a ton of depth however due to its rogue like nature and replay value is throguh the roof. my only complaint is just some more variety in a couple of regards. for example while i havent had a successful trip yet thanks to some very challenging sieges I've had several repeat encounters and locations. though it does look like the devs have been great at adding content which is awesome. overall for thr cost of the game and the hours upon hours of enjoyment you can get this is an easy recommendation.

												Death Road to Canada. Action, fun, and awesomness for you to come. This game takes everything in a zombie apoculypse, throws out the serious stuff, and leaves the really weird stuff.PROS:- Heck of a lot of fun- New story everytime you play- Quite a few different gamemodes- Controller compatible- Unique characters and ablilities- Quite challanging (took me a few hours to win for the first time)- A LOT of weapons to play around withCONS:- Playing local 2 player kind of limits P2 a bit- NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER- Confusing controls for keyboard- Soundtrack is quite limited, and after playing for a few hours straight, it gets to youOverall, this game (in my opinion) would be a high 9/10, and I'm eager to see what you guys put out in the future for this legen... wait for it... dary game!

												This game is a really fun pixelated permadeath game. You can make your own characters which is a major plus! Additionally there is a lot of easter eggs and overall charm implemented into this game. Every new game I play there is almost always something new and exciting that happens! :D At first the game is kinda hard, the RNG can kill your favourite characters! But once you learn how to play the game and ""git gud"" you will find it easier to beat it and try the harder challenges.If I had one complaint it would be that stats like loyalty and composure seem to be predetermined for every playthrough, my character is always the ""lone wolf""and I can't change that in the custom character creation. It would be great if they either randomized the stat each playthrough or we had control of that stat!Get this game if you loved Oregon Trail!!!			"

												Death Road To Canada: Few things you need to know;-Incredible replay value. Possibly the best of all time, thats bold, sure, but its truly incredible.-Never gets frustrating despite it being permadeath. Not sure why.-Good character customiser (Key word, good. You can get different stats, perks and traits for your characters, but I found theres not enough accessories, but not limited or bad.)-2 player Co-op, not online YET, but the dev team's workin' on it.-Great soundtrack. Its calm, drastic, chaotic, upbeat and relaxing.-Great combat. Lots of fun and plenty of weapons from Grenades to sledge hammers to pipe bombs to knight swords to chainsaws to flame throwers to hunting rifl- You get the point.-Regular updates-Make choices-Recruit pets-Cool references and rare characters-Different game modes-Trading camps-You can train your characters-Makes you laugh a ton ;D-And best of all... You can tell people to COOL IT.10/10. This game is incredible. I'd drop everything and buy it right now. (Or left if you like puns.)			"

												Death Road to Canada is an amazing game. On top of it's amazing humor and charming pixel graphics, the fun and engaging gameplay always keeping me coming back for more. A lot of the fun comes from never knowing whats gonna happen on the Death Road next. You can find  Jason Mason with his machete and amazing strength, as well as a fairy queen, an exploding anime girl, a  A TOO SWOLE TO CONTROL bodybuilder, a sumo wrestler, the famous mexican luchador El Satan, and even a totally normal old cat lady.The game's music is also amazing, giving you that old arcade vibe that blends with the graphics and gameplay very nicely. Take a listen here!:https://joeygrady.bandcamp.com/album/death-road-to-canada-ostThe game even has an local co-op mode at the moment. In later updates, splitscreen, four-player mode, and even potentially online play will be in the coming future.All in all, this is a great game and you should definitely a game you should check it out!

												I haven't had this much fun playing a video game in quite some time.To offer a summation:All the catharsis of a Brawler/Beat em' up, top down perspective with player creator/customization, stat gaining, Action/RPG Elements, minus any form of tedious, over-complications, Numerous modes of play to start with, even more to unlock. A quirky sense of humor akin to that of Earthbound on Drugs, with a touch of GTA, great visual aesthetic and a fantastic soundtrack, all wrapped tightly within this ever shifting post apocalyptic joyride.Bottom line:When you simply want to kick back and have a good time, I recommend this game quite highly.It's a blast.(\/)			"

												Totally recommending this game, just to get that out of the way!I'm a sucker for good survivaly scavengy games, sadly there aren't many that are competent at any of the elements they promote. Thankfully this game is very simple, not only in graphics but also in gameplay! Most of the gameplay you have is looting buildings while fending off zombies which is pretty well done. Zombies are slow but come in bulks, they aren't dangerous on their own but can corner you really easily, so don't let that happen! Once you're cornered by all the zombies you haven't killed upon your entry you shall see the errors of your ways, as rushing through a crowd of zombies is not impossible but very unlikely to survive if the horde is packed tightly enough.The humor of this game is something you should experience for yourself, as there is plenty to be found! Now, the one glaring issue this game has though, in my opinion, is 1 particular map that can come up in a ""Siege"" event... A single, narrow street with 3 dead ends. To make it clear, a siege means that a horde of zombies will continously pour in from the edges of the map, you can't kill all of those zombies and have to put up a good mix of kiting them and dispatching of the ones that block your way. That is nearly impossible on that 1 particular map, as your kiting potential is next to none when all you can do is go left or right (or get stuck in a dead end!) I find that map unfair and wish you all best luck on never getting it! ;)			"

												This game is a run and gun 8 bit style zombie survival game with campy overtones. Did I die a bunch? Yes. But did I have fun while doing it? Oh yeah!Pros: -Fun team up aspects with NPCS.-goofy aspects included like a toilet genie and some pop culture references-easy to play, fun for all agesCons:- multiplayer hard to access, hard to invite people to play on steam.8/10. I'm glad I bought this game.			"

												This game is AMAZING. The intension of detail is great, you can put your friends(And enemies) in the game, and don't forget, theres nothing more satisfying than blowing a zombies head with a Shotgun. However, the only bat parts is that the game costs a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiittle too much and its mostly based on luck. Overall THIS GAME IS JUST AWESOME!!!!			"

												Death Road to Canada. Action, fun, and awesomness for you to come. This game takes everything in a zombie apoculypse, throws out the serious stuff, and leaves the really weird stuff.PROS:- Heck of a lot of fun- New story everytime you play- Quite a few different gamemodes- Controller compatible- Unique characters and ablilities- Quite challanging (took me a few hours to win for the first time)- A LOT of weapons to play around withCONS:- Playing local 2 player kind of limits P2 a bit- NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER- Confusing controls for keyboard- Soundtrack is quite limited, and after playing for a few hours straight, it gets to youOverall, this game (in my opinion) would be a high 9/10, and I'm eager to see what you guys put out in the future for this legen... wait for it... dary game!

												This game is f*cking amazing.This is a roguelite zombie survival oregon trail game. The music and the visuals are amazing and work so well together.This game also has some nice humor that only slightly forgives the brutal difficulty.Ah yes, the difficulty. This game is REALLY hard, rng will f*ck you so hard in the a$$ it hurts, many times a good run will get ruined by one bad roll of the dice. But hey? This game is still a joy to play and the local coop is even better. If you want to have a blast and have some spare cash buy this game			"

												Just an example of what can happen in a normal play session:  Pawel leaves his home in  Florida alone to find salvation in Canada, being a mechanic, he belives he will  get there himself and fix the car whenever he needs it. Along the death road he visit traders and eventually meets up with Kirbogon, a office man who has lots of strength, but is very out of shape. Pawel recruits him and they find a clown on the side of the road, they let her in. They scavenge and rescue a woman trapped in a factory. She repays them with training.♥♥♥♥♥♥gets bad later on and the car runs out of gas, the group fights of bandits and take heavy blows to their vitality and morale, when they find a new car, clown plays a music box, Kirbogon is about to tell her to knck it off when he notices she is gone, and a  massive clown zombie hoarde outside, Clown left because her morale got too  low, and left her traveling compaions with a nice gift, PAWEL AND KIRBOGON ARE TRAPPED IN A CIRCUS WITH ZOMBIES POURING OUT OF ITS WALLS. By some miracle they survive, and have to take a clown car. They meet up with a random nerd with high wits, he leaves pretty soon. And the group finds Daryl Hall in a house, but leaves him behind as their food was low. Later on,  Pawell finds a magic toilet genie who makes his skin gray, making him have more health. They leave the clown car behind at the next trading camp due to the fact it chassis is VERY LOW. At the trading camp they buy training, and see John Oates, they leave him and continue on their journey until they find a good car and meet Nostalgia Critic on the road, and later, at the last trading camp, they replace his head witha  pugs and recruit a woman Jennife, who lost her group at the border as they were eaten in front of her. The group runs in a massive circle in the City of Crushed Hopes, and bolt it to canada, they make it to the border, while Pawel uses the last of his ammo to kill the massive horde appraching the border, A massive robo-mountie slams down to Earth and saves everyone, Pawel and his group make it to Canada in 9 driving days, and become citiznes of the last nation on Earth.  All those Zombies were hosers anyway...Very adictive, very fun game. Pick this one up.			"

												I really enjoy playing this game after a couple of rounds. The game is fairly simple control-wise and is really easy to pick up. There is a high skill ceiling however because you are supposed to not only dodge the zombies, but manage the survivability of your entire group. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys rogue-like games. I also enjoy that you have to start over after every death as it adds to the replayablility of the game. A side note: ALWAYS PICK UP WOOF			"

												If the idea of Oregon Trail mixed with a dungeon crawler sounds interesting to you, don't hesitate to get this game. It's the perfect balance of luck and skill to make you want to keep playing over and over until you get the perfect run. The only complaint I have is subpar multiplayer (and lack of online play) but it still manages to be an amazing game regardless.			"

												Death Road to Canada is a delightful game. It has a simple, top-down perspective in combat, and the overall flow of the game is not especially complicated (fight for resources, story events, siege, repeat). But, this is a well-crafted game. Even at lower difficulties, it is a rough 'n' tumble game with its beat 'em up elements, and more than often things can go downhill very fast. The humor and eccentricity is a welcome change up from the hordes of serious zombie games, and overall this is a great game to pick up and play casually when you have even 30 minutes at a time.			"
