												To make a long story short: if you like the graphics and enjoy games with insane amounts of loot, enemy variation and pure scale,  GRAB THIS ONE . I am mainly playing this game on my Vita where I have about 15 hours in at the moment, and I am still only scratching the surface.You might be rightfully concerned by the negative reviews, and many of the points concerning the UI and controls are valid, but note that many of the points have been addressed within hours, and  after one day many of the issues have already been patched !The developers respond to almost any form of criticism in the forums and in these reviews. This, in combination with the fact that the issues that kept people from getting in to the game are easily fixable, makes it very easy for me to recommend this game.  I know I am repeating myself, but do yourself a favour and try the game, if all that is keeping you from it are people that bash the horrible UI. It has been enhanced after one day and I am sure it will be completely up to par with modern games soon.  On to the game itself: The theme is a mixture between modern fairytale, the Discworld and classic fantasy RPG settings. It works very well in my opinion and in the story mode everything comes together as more than just a skin for another roguelike. The dialogues are usually quite short, but there is a deeper story that slowly unfolds after some initial standard type quests.  The progression is linear in the beginning, since at that point you can only go to places where you currently have missions, but the world opens up more and more as you progress. At first I was frustrated to not be able to go back to some places, but it is a mechanic that keeps you from farming the same difficulty dungeon again and again, which is the same for almost every roguelike (where you can go back to previous floors but they will remain empty once you looted and killed everything).The core gameplay is the most important part of course, and it is simply addicting. Combat leaves a lot of space for strategy, since you have both a melee and a ranged weapon (as well as spells and bombs) and additionally pets can deal damage and tank enemies. Every enemy type behaves differently and uses lethal skills that you have to learn to evade. Different weapons behave differently (e.g. spears hit two fields in front of you instead of just one). There are elemental attacks and resistances/weaknesses you have to exploit.The flow of the game is faster than many other roguelikes I've played, even faster than Dungeons of Dredmor (which I adore by the way). The action feels very satisfying with some nice bullet-time effects when you kill enemies or land critical strikes. Skill and spell animations are sometimes mind-blowingly cool, like tiles jumping up and down in a circle around you.There are typical roguelike mechanics like traps, special rooms, hidden treasure, shrines, teleports, unique (named) enemies and much more, but also some unusual mechanics like hidden rooms or blocks you can push around. Explaining the latter would spoil a lot because it is part of the game to figure them out.As a nice addition there is fishing and crafting, the former needs some rework to be more fun, the latter becomes an important part of the game when you advance further and have to manage the many parts of equipment you can have.The graphics have been compared to tablet/mobile games, I can somehow see where this is coming from, since the sprites seem to have been created via pre-rendered models, but I suggest you just look at the screenshots and evaluate that for yourself. In my opinion the environments have a level of detail and beauty to them that is unrivalled for this style of 2D games.To address some of the complaints:- ""Diagonal movement is difficult on controllers."" True, definitely needs some recalibration or the Shiren/Izuna solution, where you have to press a button to move diagonally. Surprisingly this did not get in my way very often.- ""It is hard to see what is behind walls and you can get stuck in sticky situations."" The style of the graphics leads to confusing situations, but you can use the mini-map (especially the enlarged one) in sticky situations to make tile perfect decisions and execute them. An option to display a grid with some color coding for traversability would help here.- ""Controls are bad."" They are fast and need getting used to, but that is all. After an hour you feel right at home and I prefer them being as fast as they are. An option to adjust speed would be cool though.- ""UI is broken"". Some things are more tedious than they need to be, like shopping and comparing equipment, and I do not like the item description display (showing equipment stats that are never used for materials and consumables like in Disgaea is something I hate!). But everything can be done quite fast and the large and small hand-drawn icons for every single item really great! I can see very small changes that would make the UI as good as any other game, but at the moment it keeps the game from getting the amazement it deserves.All in all it is a must buy, and I hope that the constant efforts of the developers in the recent days will change some of the reviewers minds, since a lot has been addressed or is being addressed at the moment. The core gameplay is a 10/10 for me, but the UI prevents me from giving the game the perfect score for now.			"

												As someone who kickstarted DFS, I have to admit that I'm impressed with the game so far. Considering this is Grimm Bros.' first game, it's a lot of fun and has a lot of charm packed into its story. It's got flaws (the UI, the crafting), but roguelike fans should still get a kick out of it.PROS:- Three game modes (Story, Survival, Endless Labyrinth)- Two difficulties (Normal and Hardcore/Permadeath)- Unlockable characters in Endless Labyrinth- Controller support (and it feels great now, thanks to patch)- Pets to collect, up to two in your party- Crafting and fishing systems to play around with (fishing bug has been patched)- The dungeon areas have a lot of little secrets- Devs are listening, taking in feedback, and releasing patches to fix major issuesCONS:- Crafting UI is awful.- Menu system needs to be reworked- Not enough information in battle- Dungeons can feel ""cluttered"" and sometimes tricky to see/escape- A lack of keybindings- Storage space is smallSUBJECTIVE:- The game can be difficult as hell (For me, a huge pro)- The aesthetics (bright/vibrant colors!)Having put some time into it, I can definitely recommend this to fans of the roguelike genre. The combat mixes in melee with ranged. Pets provides some tactical advantage since it allows for flanking/backstabbing, and they have leveling independent from your own. You've got a rage meter, magic spells, and a crafting system to play around with. Scattered throughout the dungeons themselves are traps, switches that benefit or harm, rare merchants that sell crazy stuff, switches that create surprises when hit in the right order, and more.And now to clarify some of the cons.Most of these are small gripes. Admittedly, a lack of keybindings does hurt the game, especially since you're forced to navigate the (rather simple) menu in order to access Inventory, Equipment, Magic, etc. Adding keys to individually open up these specific menus would be great, but it's a small issue since the menu is easy enough to navigate. Also, you DO have storage space - but it's not terribly large and you may run out of space fairly quickly. Fellow packrats, be warned.The crafting UI, on the other hand, is just plain bad. Your learned complex recipes (gear and such) are on the left-hand side and this is fine. However, simpler recipes such as creating planks out of raw wood, or the number of zinc required to make an ingot, are absent. Either memorization or documentation is needed for these, unless I'm missing something obvious. Additionally, you can only craft one item at a time. When crafted, it's required to move the finished product out of the ""completed"" slot before crafting the next one. It's tedious as hell and really needs to be modified.Additionally, the menu doesn't need an Inventory screen. It's redundant when compared to the Equipment screen. Combat, while a lot of fun, also just doesn't give you enough information on your enemies and pets. You can't check individual pet HP, you can't scroll through enemy HP to prioritize them (a problem when in a crowd, since it could be a bit tricky to make out which bar belongs to who). I'm still wrapping my head around terrain bonuses, which would have benefitted from some kind of mouse-over or something. In short, the UI needs love. Lots of it.CLOSING:Overall, I personally feel that the game feels FUN despite its flaws, although (once again) you need to be a fan of roguelikes. This game is *hard.* If you enjoyed Dungeons of Dredmor, Izuna, Shiren the Wanderer, etc. then there's a good chance you'll enjoy what's here.That and the idea of Red Riding Hood traipsing through the woods, cheerfully murdering monsters is an idea that appeals to me.As stated before, this is Grimm Bros.' first game. It's kinda rough, it's by no means perfect, but it's a solid title. I gave the devs my money and put my faith in them, and I've got faith that they'll keep updating/supporting this title by making it shine even more. Patches have already been shoved through the pipeline and they're checking their forums as well as Steam's.Will update this review as necessary.Edit: Added some details on the dungeon-crawling and removed the detail saying that DFS has farming. There is NO farming, I was writing this at 4am and had just finished a surreal dream about Kevin Costner. Also, my biggest cons have been patched, so huzzah! DEFINITELY recommend it now!			"

												Sadly I will have to give this title a ""thumb down"". As we know amazing art assets does not create an amazing experience. I can see a lot of poor decision that the dev team made for convinience( like given more ephasis to the portability of the product) by sacrificing game experience itself. -Front Ortho-cam is rather unefficient to handle multiple overlaying scene objects that are more than one square unit tall. -No key shortcuts or key remaping options (after all you dont use keys on a tablet or phone right?). -There is a lack of user feedback and tons of redability problems.That said the art would be the only thing that could justify the current price. If you are not art an art oriented person I would suggest you to think twice before purchasing this title.=====================Second Edition==================Hello Ash and Grimm Bros Team,It is nice to see that the dev team is willing to improve the current product and hear the customers’ opinions and observations. Since you took the time to take my opinion into account I would be more than happy to provide you a more detailed answer. Before getting into those details I want to express that I’m aware of the complexity that is involved on the creation of any interactive media product and how difficult it is to create an accurate user-product dynamic. I do apologize for my English as well, since it is not my first language. With that said, lets begin with the answer you requested me.USER FEEDBACK RELATED ISSUES:Cut-Scenes:When watching the intro cut scene I saw no “press <input> to skip” kind of message so my first thoughts were that transition between one cut scene image and the other one was automatic. Then the dialog stopped and it didn’t advance automatically. Hmmm…maybe I should press a key but which Key? There were no clues to figure out the key that I should press. I wanted to see the intro cut scene so my concern was: “what if I press an input to close or skip the whole cut scene instead of advancing to the next part of the cut scene”. I tried pressing space, enter and a bunch of other keys. But the game wasn’t asking me for a key. It wanted me to perform a click. Too much user-guessing right from the beginning. Game Mini Map:A mini-map’s main functionality is to allow the players to locate themselves on it. That means that you main focal stress on a mini-map should be the convention that represents the player on the map. A yellow pixel on top of equal sized brow pixels are not the best pallet and form choices to achieve this. All the other secondary elements on the mini-map (NPC and items) are more visible than the main character’s location itself. Conventions take a while to figure them out since there is no visible map legend to take a look at. Also it would be nice to be able to see key level features on the minimal like where are the local-zone teleporters located.Party health and stats:Moment to moment feedback of you party member’s is a must have. I can only see my party members’ health-bar briefly when moving from one tile to another one. Why not showing it always to allow the player to take more accurate decision and weight the risks before moving. Key bindings:In the beginning I thought that there were no key shortcuts on this game. Then I read in some forums that apparently there is some key shortcuts but not much information about them. The game should include a control scheme section to be able to see the possible inputs for the user.Also the ESC key functionality could be a little bit more practical. Open main menu and close menus will be a more common setup for this key.Curse Skull Icon:I didn’t notice when it was added to my screen or for what reason. I thought maybe is the time that I have to complete my quest. Then I notice that I ran out of time but I didn’t failed the quest. Then my conclusion was maybe is a period of time in which the undead enemies spawns. But again I was misled to believe that because of the undead iconography. Then I notice that it didn’t appear again. Long story short the 4th time I got cursed was when I realized that that Icon was meant to be the curse duration GUI representation element.Chosen Path for the main character:If you give the players the ability to move by clicking on the ground at least show them which path is the one that the AI is going to choose since the best path decided by the AI is not always the path that the player has in mind or would like to take. Moving by clicking is rather risky since the player is not able to forecast which path the AI is going to pick.READABILITY RELATED ISSUES:Overlaying Objects:I can see how important was to create non-square art assets to maintain the overall aesthetic of the game. But, the proportions of the objects combined with the chosen orthogonal perspective create a lot of undesired overlapping. I can see that the current solution allows the player to see the main character through the front objects by reducing the opacity of the last ones but the low opacity is not enough to see the immediate surroundings of the player. It is really difficult to spot obstacles, path and items on dense vegetation areas were a lot of overlapping occurs.Input inconsistency:In terms of inputs there are some dynamics that are natural for the user to expect. One user input equals to one outcome. If the user press the movement key once he or she would be expecting for the character to move one step on the map instead of two. The same can be said on the menu. If the user press the down key to go to the next option it should go down one step not two. Vegetation and Terrain coexistence:The Vegetation and the terrain does not integrate well in terms of creating a clear paths for the player to follow. Sometimes the vegetation can spawn in some places where it would give the impression that the player reached the boundaries of the map but is only an illusion created by the graphic composition on screen. This can be rather annoying if a target or objective is located on an area that is only reachable through that path. This is one of the biggest risks of leaving the level design to a procedural process. It can work very well sometimes but other times it could go really wrong.UI Usability:Trying to open the options menu is rather risky if you miss the button. The icon that brings the in-game main menu has a rather small clickable area and size. If you miss the click your character will walk towards the border of the screen no matter how far it is and how dangerous it is. You could step over several traps or get into undesirable fights. Also it would be nice to be able to close the menus by clicking outside them instead of closing each menu one by one.Once again thank you for hearing my observations and I will look forward to see the evolution process of your product.

												First, let me address some of the issues that people bring up.It's turn-based like old rogue games. Each time you move or attack, the enemies move or attack. You fight in the cardinal directions, so you need to be smart about your positioning. All of this is as-designed. Making this a real-time game would make it a different game. If you're looking for something real-time, then you'd need to look for a different game. Part of the fun is predicting enemy actions and movements, making a deliberate choice, and being surprised. Related, you can't turn on a grid, but really, how hard is it to mentally overlay squares on the map?The UI is not fantastic, but it's not horrible, either. Press a key (U) to open up the high-level menu, then navigate between inventory, equipment, crafting, etc. Sometimes it's easier to use a mouse within some of those sub-menus. I don't understand how this is all that different from Skyrim. It's not the pinnacle of user interface design, but I don't think it should be seen as a show-stopper.People are also complaining about the pet AI being bad. But again, to me, part of the fun is trying to predict the AI, which, like real intelligence, isn't completely predictable. I've found that with some careful consideration, I've been successful in making things align such that my pet is kicking♥♥♥♥♥with me most of the time. Again, it takes some strategy.In my opinion, this game is suffering from the same problems that many roguelike games are suffering from: some gamers just don't ""get"" these types of games. They expect something different. These types of games are not for everyone. But at least this one has a Classic Mode that allows you to save your progress to learn how it works before going hardcore.I played for two hours last night and can't wait to get back into it tonight. This game is oozing strategy. Heaps of items, >500 crafting recipes, lots of fun to be had with equipment and skill combinations, challenging positioning gameplay, random world generation, lots of stats. Anyone that says that there isn't enough content for $20 is out of their mind, if you ask me. Some of these reviewers have like 5 hours into the thing. That's $4/hr. C'mon.It takes time to learn games like this. I remember picking up Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and it felt like I was studying in school or something to learn how it worked. But it paid off. You'll find similarities in this game if you've played Stone Soup before.You'll need to be willing to put a little time into understanding how this game works. But it's worth it.			"

												I was really excited for this game, and followed the development for a while. I just can't recommend the game, though. I love roguelikes and have played a number of them (Caves of Qud, ToME, DCSS, etc.), and this game isn't nearly as fun as any of those. The controls are akward, the UI is clunky, the missions are boring, and it's hard to even see what is going on. I gave it a shot, and was sorely disappointed.EDIT: Developer responded, apparently they have updated the game. I won't be playing it, though as I was turned off by the initial release and refunded the game. Hopefully the kinks were worked out and the game is as good as it seemed it was going to be prerelease. Cheers.			"

												This game is honestly amazing. Dragon fin soup took an approach to combat and crafting that I've never seen before in a Roguelike.  Guns, bombs, spells, booze and adult humor everywhere. The difficulty is challenging, Crafting items is a treat, with recipes as of the latest patch being numerous, rewarding and shared between all playthroughs. The game became incredibly replayable, especially on the Survival modes. With that said, when the game launched there were problems with the UI being a bit clunky and recipes were hard to come by, but the developers are very responsive to player feedback and the UI was patched to perfection and recipes reworked to be shared between all playthroughs. The quick response has me feeling hopeful for future content from this game and its devs.			"

												Idea is good, the implementation is not.Pros:+ pleasent graphics and animation;+ humor in dialogs;Cons:- repetitive boring music;- repetitive boring gameplay: fishing, digging, crafting  and at some point fighting are not enjoyable anymore;- weird mechanic: lucky dodges, stats which doesn't tell/explain anything, all same weapons/gear;- poor UI, game is targeting too many platforms and as always PC version suffer: lack of keybindings, partially working hotkeys (you can open inventory with F1, but you can't close it with F1), with mouse is easier to talk to npc, but impossible to combat;- perspective is weird: it's unclear where are obstacles, walls below obscure view;- effects: fog, strange lightning change;- primitive AI.- map: it's half-opaque, hard to see on certain background, maximized map is absolute crap, colors indication is terrible (red enemies and green friends are ok, rest = crap).- bugs: got many UI related bugs, disabling touch-screen will disable mouse lol, most annoying is to get impossible to complete quest;- quest system: poor description and rewards, boring non-skipable dialogs, repetitive random encounters;- balance: digging may yield item for lvl 40 worth 30k, while completing quest rewards with just few coins and worthless items;- fishing: boring, unclear, but with related quests;- crime system: incomplete, unclear and worthless;- no steam ingegration: no cloud, no achievements, not even cards;- magic system is dumb;Game feels shiny at first look, but once you get few levels the woah feelings are gone and you see how incomplete it is and how much polishing it required. Stay away and don't be fooled (as me) by videos, it's boring as hell.			"

												I've had a lot of fun with this game. The fighting can get as hectic or as slow and methodical as you want it to be. If you want to treat it like a game of Gauntlet, you can, but you'll get cut down pretty quickly, because some of these monsters are vicious, and invisible with AOE attacks or subtle but deadly sapping attacks. Like a floating cloud of pixies that floats in your blind spot and sucks you dry, or an ice spirit that spawns out of a random stalagmite and destroys your whole party with a frost blast. Or all of that plus a ghoul, a skeleton in a wedding veil, some giant golems, either attacking you or patrolling, or sleeping, or stepping on hidden traps so you don't have to. And you were just innocently trying to gather some soil samples, or deliver a package, or find a particularly rare and delicious fish in a hidden pond. It's a tough world, luckily you have friends. And pets. I love the pets, they can learn tricks, and level up, and they're pretty helpful. If you lose your pets, you better change your position in your chair and move close to the screen because it's time to ♥♥♥♥ing focus. That's when you can become easily overwhelmed by a bunch of low level enemies. But some might consider the pets a crutch, because they definitely are a game changer. Without them watching your back, you will need to run most of the time and use more bombs and range weapons. But then again the pet AI is so dumb that you will need to jump in save your wolf friend at times. I prefer to think instead of dumb AI its just a stupidly brave wolf-dog that gets in over his head sometimes, needing you to jump in front so he can jump in from behind. You can also hire an NPC party member to watch your back. Or you might luck onto a wandering hero and follow them through a dungeon, grabbing whatever loot and treasure chests they seem to ignore. Or you can just go around breaking people's stuff and trading the scrap in for gold. I guess these beds and dinner tables belong to the monsters? Well they're now a bunch of metal rods and boards I can sell or craft.There is also crafting, tons of loot, a lot of underlying mechanics I haven't figured out yet, random encounters that are fun, and a plot in there somewhere. A whimsical kind of humor and a female protagonist that is cute and sassy but not overly snarky or an a%-hole, like a real stand up, kick♥♥♥♥♥ and fall down with a bottle of dragonberry rum kind of lady.  Just don't overdo it with the booze health items, or she'll black out and lose control and go ax murderer berserk, which might get you out of a jam, where she kills everybody. Or it may get you to the Game Over screen if the enemies tactics are too deadly. Like projectile and AOE users are immune to disorganized melee attacks, even if she is extra durable and deals out extra berserker damage. Its an interesting dynamic and adds to fun game play either way. Just make sure to save periodically. Or live dangerously and play in Hardcore rogue-like mode. I have no problems recommending this one. It's fun, it s quirkly, it's got a lot of ""game"" to play around with. It's not perfect, the graphical representation of doors and portals and some distances can be a little confusing at times, or you might miss something. The blind-spot/shadows of perception mechanic can also hit or miss with some. I happen to like it, especially with the lighting that comes with dynamic time of day and weather changes. There isn't much I don't like about the game, the UI is a little clunky, but I use the mouse to get around it. Between the mouse and the gamepad, I get by and have a lot of fun. The game could use some polish, but I like it how it is, and am enjoying it quite a bit. Give it a try if you like rogue-likes or games like Azure Dreams or Izuna the Unemployed Ninja. If you like dungeon crawling and collecting weapons and leveling and leaving a trail of dead, this game is for you.			"

												Fun roguelike with a funny story. They are rushing to fix some launch issues like fishing not working and hopefully fixing vendors not refreshing items. Other than that its pretty fun, controller controls are kinda clunky so i use my mouse. Pretty good roguelike, gets hard fast and thats canon to the genre so i'm happy :3If on the fence, i'd wait a patch or two for launch bugs. I mean this day and age, even afterbirth for isaac has some pretty severe launch bugs and that got glossed over			"

												This is first and foremost a game similiar (very) to Dungeons Of Dredmor; hence a rogue-like; even when it also offers a campaing mode without the typical permadeath.gamepay works just like in Dredmor, basicaly the game is turnbased: move, attack, use items skills; every action uses one ""turn"", you enemies and allies (you can have up to two pets at once fighting for ya) move after you made your ""turn""; similiar to Dredmor you can either play the game more fast paced or take your time..the choice is up to.what the game differs from Dredmor and other rogue-likes is the character-system, there is no skill/talent or anything progression; when you level you get stat-upgrades automaticaly, which take away alot of the good rogue-likes normaly present: character-building; yes, you can still make different choices depending on your equipment (which there`s a metric ton of...and wearable at the same time)...but still it feels alot more shallow than normal rogue-likes/lights.new skills/spells are aquired just like gear/loot is and can be equiped just aswell.the game offers over 500 crafting recipes, all from food to gear..so there`s alot to collect.the game has one major strength: it`s visual design; Pratchett, Grimm, typical fantasy sticks all blend into a very upbeat, colourfull gameworld with some amazing 2D backround and character art. the soundtrack isn`t outstanding, but it works..there`s basicaly no voice-over.what doesn`t work is the humor, there`s alot of the wit and ""joke"" missing the visuals suggest; it`s not terrible just a tad underwhelming.all in all a rather streamlined rogue-like, Dredmor, yet still great fun in small haps; if you can dig the price and got a nack for tbs rogue-likes or the visual still (some light rpg) definitly worth a look.

												Bad things first: Menu system is not convenient. (batering and crafting especially). Too many non-essential quests. (They are repetitive, but you have to finish them to proceed) They make the pace of the story a little slow.However, these cons are not crucail. The game is still enjoyable: Interesting battle. This is a turn-based game, if you stay down nothing gonna happen. You have plenty of time to think your strategy. You have your pets (although sometimes your pets are stupid) your guns (Shotgun, pistol, rifle...  every gun have various ammo) bomes, melee weapons and skills (magic). Use them all in the battle and that's great! The potion (recover your HP) is some kind of Rum. But you'd better not drink them constantly, something bad will happen... Weather system is so ♥♥♥♥ing cool; Immersive scenes (spider forest... so disgusting but cool). Overall, pros > cons.			"

												Never heard of this game before it appeared on the New releases list, but I'm enjoying it immensly so far. Gotta love positive surprises :)Pros:- Feels unique, can't really compare it to anything else- Fun and complex game mechanics- Special type of turnbased movement that works great (feels actiony, not old and stale)- Three game modes (1 proper RPG campaign + 2 fun rogue-likes)- Campaign feels significantly different from the other modes- Amazing, otherwordly graphics/art- Vibrant world, exotic and colorful mobs- Weather system, day/night cycle- Mature-ish dialogue- Music and sound effects are great too- Supports 3440x1440 resolution :)- Works great with gamepad *Cons:- * UI/menus need working on, takes too long to equip, esp. w/gamepad- No cloud save8.5/10 (which will be bumped to 9/10 if UI gets perfected)			"

												My god, this game scratches a strange itch i've had for a very long time. Dragon Fin Soup is a wonderful modern take on ""classic"" roguelikes that doesn't forgoe absolutely everything that makes the genre, like most games I see in the ""roguelike"" tag. Combat feels satisfying, crafting is intriguing, map generation is interesting enough, and the art is just so damn beautiful! What's not to love here?I will admit the UI and control scheme do have their fair share of issues; but as of Day 2 the devs have already pushed a patch that fixes some of the more glaring problems, which is huge in my book. Not to mention it just feels /so/ good to be able to kick back with a 360 controller and crawl through a neverending variety of visually pleasing dungeons. Very optimistic for the future!Don't be so quick to judge by the bad reviews, and don't purchase expecting an epic, expansive rpg experience. I went in expecting a roguelike and it wholeheartedly delivers on that front. Can't recommend this enough to fans of the genre, and i'm sure i'll be sinking a hell of a lot of time into it in the coming days/weeks/months. "

												It's a pretty solid graphical rougelike.First, read the manual. Anything about useing the mouse (or even wasd) to run around and/or fight, forget it. Use the 10-key. Use the mouse for crafting and/or abilities.I do like the way the fighting works. While turn-based, it still gives a sense of urgancy.			"

												Huge fan of Mystery Dungeon Styled Games. Yet there's VERY little quantity availible. Found this Gem and had to give it a try. After ""Testing"" It out I had to give this game a solid purchase and here I am!Don't go by my playtime as most of it was using the DRM Free version.PROS-Mystery Dungeon Game!Solid art style and graphics to match it.Full Instructions screen Labeled ""Read of Die!"" Which is literal.Has Endless Dungeon Mode! Lot of Mystery Dungeons don't add this, it's essential!Godlike amounts of craftingMovable/Manipulative Landscape. Able to break down trees and fences!ACTIVE DEV TEAM. This was what really solidified my purchase. Seeing immidiate responses and every negative reviews complaints being worked on immidiately to better the series. Also knowing some of the Dev team is a local here in SF is great :)CONS- Already being worked on by the Dev team but,Keybindings (already noted as being added in next patch)Visibility! Lot of trees/graves/rocks makes navigating difficult. They need to add a button that makes all 1+ tile high objects go see-through like if you were behind them. Simple Fix!User Interface needs cleaning up or added keybinds (Noted as being worked on for next patch already! Wow)Honestly the games been well done, they went a bit far to please everyone by adding a bunch of different control methods but in doing so they mastered none of them. Yet they're working on this already so I'm proud to own this game.If you're a fan of MYSTERY DUNGEON GAMES like Chocobo Dungeon, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Etrian Mystery Dungeon or Shiren the Wanderer you MUST give this game a shot!

												I have only played this game for an hour or so, but I enjoyed it contrary to the other reviews. Here is why.I was one of the kickstarter backers for this game. I was aware from the screenshots what kind of game it will be but I took a risk and backed it anyhow. The way the game is built is like it is one big Final Fantasy tactics map, but unlike that kind of game, the ""step by step"" map system is active even outside of battles. This may be frustrating at times but also fun as it gives you the feeling that you are playing the game the whole time, as opposed to feeling that you are playing a challenge only when battles arise. At times you will find the movement clunky, especially if you are using joypad, but you could always use the mouse to select where to go and she will go there automatically, or u can destroy the trees and obstacles in your path to create your own path, collecting loot as you do so.If you can get past the clunkiness and accept that the game was intentionally created this way, there is a deep sense of fun and involvement. I like the world and the idea. A drunken ""red riding hood"" and her pet wolf working as mercenaries for hire while also trying to discover her past. The artwork, character and mood of the ambient music makes u feel very involved. Remember, when you feel stuck or can't get past some place, that means there is something u need to do or figure out. Whether it is a puzzle or simply needing to destroy the obstacle down to keep moving, any obstacles or ""clunkiness"" in the game is intentional. It feels this way.Overall it is a fun experience if you want to try something new and wiling to get past the default preconceptions of how a game SHOULD be. The obstacles and clunkiness are no different than the frustration one feels when you play the original megaman games and you realize that you can't duck. :) It is part of the gameAlso knowing that this game was made by 5 indie developers, they did quiet a good job. Also the artwork and world inspired by the Grimm Brothers' tales really connects to me. :)To sum upPros:-Lovely Artwork-New Idea-Involving gameplay-Interesting Music-Loveable characters-Nice contradiction between a colorful world and a moral-less culture-You get better at it the more you play it-Some puzzles are not explained and you feel a sense of satisfaction when you figure them out on your own-It feels like one big game as opposed to separate layouts for battles and walking the map (turned based environment, like one big chess board)-Tons of looting. There is crafting too but haven't tried it yet. :)- Even though it is a rogue-like game, the default storymode offers you an option to restore when dead as well as saves, so you have the choice between playing a normal game in story mode or a permadeath game in survival mode. :)Cons:-Not what you expect it at first to be-the clunky turned based movement takes you off guard at first-no tutorial whatsoever. The instructions are with the manual included with the game. I got it as a kickstarter backer. Not sure if it's included with steam purchase (update: discovered the manual exists in the main menu under the title ""Read or Die"" :) )-can make u feel confused at times and wondering if you are doing the right thing-puzzles not being explained can be frustrating to some peopleOverall if you give it a chance you find yourself enjoying it. There was definitely effort invested in this game. I personally enjoyed it. Feel free to see which cons and pros matter more to you before you purchase it. :)I personally give it 7/10 :)			"

												A fun game that could still use some polishing (and the devs are aware of that and have changes coming). Game is enjoyable and challenging and a nice mix of hacking away on enemies, but still requiring you to think ahead to keep alive. I dont feel like the controls are super intuitive, but it also never feels like it is hindering the game either. There is a bit of a learning curve, but nothing overly punishing about the process beyond maybe a quick reload (save if you are unsure)Its an enjoyable title, and the devs do seem to care and are working to keep polishing it up. 1st Update came within the first week of release. Did back this through kickstarter, so have seen it coming along for awhile now, even if its relatively new. Update: Each patch has been a good step forward, and many small nagging UI issues/bugs are gone. Still some things that could be cleaned up a bit more for my taste, but the continued progress has been nice to see and seems like it will be there shortly.			"

												DFS is a gorgeous roguelike that wears its inspiration on its sleeve, but never gives you a heavy handed smack with its complexity. Although in a classic sense, DFS is a good example of a modern take on the roguelike/lite genre,a few things feel a bit lackluster in the complete package. The campaign mode is enchanting, but incredibly repetitive. It follows a simple formula that boils down to ""do a few randomly generated ""go here, do this"" quests, then receive something to advance the story"". While this isn't really a problem, it feels like it's delaying the storyline unnecessarily by making what should essentially be ""sidequests"" into a necesary part of the game.The randomly generated modes of the game offer great fun in a nicely digestible format. If you're itching for something to sink a few hours at a time in without excessive frustration, this may be your ticket. If you're looking for a deep, complex roguelike such as ADOM or ToME, the lack of options may feel a little restrictive.			"

												The gameplay is solid and the story is somewhat engaging.However, this game is heavily marred by bugs, crashes, and glitches.Your map may zoom in on you, the playable area might zoom in on you, you may end up firing at something before you are even allowed a chance, enemies will spawn in weird places.  This is just the tip of it.What nailed my recommendation is when the game just suddenly crashed, repeatedly, when I'm in a story area.  And my computer should be able to handle this no problem.If this is a game you would want to play one day make sure it's heavily discounted or in a bundle(where I bought mine from.  Still worth it, though.).			"

												Dragon Fin Soup is a meticulously-crafted, deep, beautiful roguelike with RPG elements. It’s the perfect entry point for players who like the idea of roguelikes but who have been put off by other games with bland, minimalist graphics and impossible difficulty curves. It might even be enough to appeal to Diablo fans looking for a similar, but less frantic turn-based experience.Make no mistake, this game can be difficult and you will die - a lot. Unlike the more hardcore roguelikes, however, Dragon Fin Soup has an active save system that somewhat mitigates against the difficulty. (Roguelike purists can turn this off for a really punishing experience.)Dragon Fin Soup has a wonderfully dry, restrained sense of humor - without rubbing it into your face or overstaying its welcome.All artwork is simply stunning. Every monster and NPC has a lovingly detailed portrait as good as any caricature artist that I have ever seen. Overall the art is vibrant, colourful and cartoonish - perfect for a backlit monitor – something that in my view we don’t see enough in a world where everything is apparently supposed to be dark, gritty and sepia toned.You can tell this game is a labor of love, demonstrated by the many ‘trivial’ details, such as balls in the home town that you can kick around, the fact that you can fell trees in a row by having one falling tree crash into another… and another, and the selection of cheesy fully vocalised songs sung by the entertainer in the tavern.And I haven’t even mentioned yet the enormous loot table, pets, fishing, the detailed crafting system and a kick-@rse female protagonist.I can be a critical reviewer but I am struggling to find much to criticise here. About the worst I can say is that the lack of an in-game tutorial is a shame (mitigated, to some degree, by a series of dev hints accessible off the main men).Dragon Fin Soup has been maligned by a selection of reviews since release due to a range of day-one bugs and other problems. With the most recent patch (1.07, 9 Feb 2016) the vast majority of these complaints have been resolved. It’s a shame that as a result of early hickups this game will likely struggle to find the audience that it deserves.Dragon Fin Soup reminds me of why I love computer games.			"

												I backed this on Kickstarter because the plot premise looked good but the implementation leaves soooo much to be desired. - The plot moves at glacial pace with repetitive filler quests out weighing plot quests almost 5-1. To be honest the plot feels non-existent. Tetris moves at a faster pace.- Game breaking levelling bug. Every once in a while the loading screen freezes and I lose 3 levels (and nothing else). But the enemy doesn't. Since your foes level with you this is incredibly problematic since grinding to recover those levels is impossible.- Crafting is the only reliable way to get good equipment but is buggy and disorganized. I have 10 duplicate recipes for leather and none of them are sorted. Seriously why? And why can't I add ""animal hide x3"" instead of ""animal hide x3"", ""animal hide x1"" and ""animal hide x1""?- The flanking bonus you get from the pets is awesome. The fact that you can't interact with them is not. You can't heal them or stop them from running of and dieing against some random creature. This means that all the pets end up several levels below you and are OKO'd at later levels. This gets worse with the leveling bug.- Combat isn't tactical and it's so slow you can't even call it a button masher. I can hit the attack button 4 times before Robin makes 1 attack, while enemies can make 3 and cancel the move you just started. Can you imagine trying to reposition and attack when facing a boss? Good luck.- The humour starts out funny, like an ill-timed fart, but gets old real fast. Most of the humour comes from the randomly generated names and quest dialogue. So you'll see the occasional funny combination and a exponential amount of repetition.It's trying waaaay to hard.I hate leaving things unfinished especially stories, but this is just painful. I'm done. Good luck to you poor souls who try the game.			"

												So Dragon Fin Soup caught my eye long time ago, when the Project started on Kickstarter. I've been playing this game for 2 hours now, and all I can say is that this game suprised me. I was sceptical about the turnbased kind of gameplay but I was really satisfied with it in the end. Combat feels nice, when you want to plan your moves, simply slow down. Using your gadgets is pretty cool.  The game feels kinda oldschool in general. Like other developer they hid some known characters here and there, which is nice to see. I have to say, I've been always diging Randis work, the game art is on the spot. It's really amazing that all the art was done by just one person. The game has some minor Problems, yes - But I am certain that the developer will take care of them soon. For their first game, this is nice. I am proud of you :')P.S: ♥♥♥♥ the guy who put the Ring ""Certain Death"" in there. I still have to admit I laughed when I put it on.  "

												I was hesitant to buy this game, on the one hand I like heavily scripted/story driven RPG games, and I have no issues with rogue likes.The reason why I didn't buy this the instant it came out is, of course, the 'mixed' rating (at time of writing) of this game. After 6 hours of gameplay I must say that _sometimes_ a minor issue does pop up. But mostly I think the negative ratings are way too critical and dismissive of the obvious charm that this game displays.I like the story, the main character, the visuals and the controls are not as buggy as many of the reviews would have you beleive. In short, this is a nice game. Get it if you're a fan of rogue likes and/or story-driven RPG.			"

												Quick Initial Impressions after ~3 hours. Quick note to people playing this atm, I would suggest reading up on the in game manual guide to get a better sense of what all the status ailments are and stats on your hero do.PROS+Humor, for example, each piece of loot has a tiny line of description. I found a shield with poorly written handwriting on it and the description something of the likes of: ""May have been written by a dyxlexic person.""  +Tons of Loot with an accompanied slot on the hero, such as earings, ring slots, head slot, cape slot? (for her hood?) the type of ammo she equips, her gun (shotgun, rifle or handgun,) and it goes on and on.+As above, you can customize your ""loadout"" so to speak, and choose if you want a more defensive approach, instead of dual wielding weapons, perhaps you want to use a sword and board approach. While you may do less damage, your shield will provide you the proper defenses necessary. You can also choose what type of ammo you want to use. There are a plethora of ammo types with their own strengths and weaknesses (perhaps even elemental attributes later on in the game?)+Tons of crafting, there are a ton of recipes to be found in all the maps. While crafting isn't necessary, I can already tell I will be at an advantage if I choose to.+Exploration is rewarded, every map that is randomly generated (as far as I am aware of) has nooks and crannies filled with crafting recipes, potions, or random loot.  The more your dig the more you may find. +Artstyle is amazing, there are three levels of zoom during the game. You can zoom out to see a large portion of the map and your hero, or zoom in really close up to get right in the action. Each enemy is well drawn in game and their hero portrait reminds me of games like Jeanne D arc or Tactics Ogre for the PSP. Love love love the art design, and what is amazing is that is was done all by one guy. +Day and night effects really effect the game. As you progress through a quest and time passes by, the map gets darker as it gets later. When it gets really dark, it can make things difficult to see. A cool feature in my opinion that isn't done in many games.+Weather effects! So far I have seen sunny, rainy, and windy effects. It makes the world you are slaying monsters in feel a bit more alive as everything isn't so stagnant. The weather effects really are great! Hopefully there is snow later on!+Random events as you travel from quest to quest. So far its just bandits trying to steal your money, you are given the option to give them your gold or fight them to the death to keep it.  Hopefully these random events change up, but I liked that there was some random element to the game.Indifferent+- Dumps you in to the game world without really a tutorial or a quick learning guide. What does MP do in this game? What does each stat mean on your hero? Why should you craft? You gave me a wolf at the start of the game as my pet, it attacks monsters, is there anything else to it? +-There is a ton of loot in the game, and as far as I can tell none of it changes the appearance of your hero. While I can understand that would be difficult to implement, it really would have brought up the immersion to your hero one extra notch. Like in Zelda Link to the past, when Link gets a different color tunic, he changes to red or blue link. Or in Diablo where your weapon and armor constantly change your appearance. What you see in the trailers is what you get, red Robin (the name of our hero in this game.)+-I am at the point where monsters are getting really tough and all the potions I bought from the shop are not restocking. They haven't restocked at all during my first three hours, and to be honest you kind of need to balance slaying and quaffing potions from time to time throughout each quest/map.  Without potions, you are going to die sooner or later as there is no block mechanic in this game.  CONS-So you are pretty much a mercenary for hire, where you go get odd jobs for money at the local pub.  Story starts off super slow, at the two to three hour mark is when you start learning about the protagonist Robin, for an RPG (and roguelike) that is a bit on the slower end of things. The first couple of hours you are just doing a couple fetch quests and kill quests from some dude in the pub, and without a sense of purpose of why you are going on these missions there really is no value you what you are doing. I was asking myself, why does gold matter, why do I want to progress to the next level? -Soundtrack is decent, but whats more upsetting is the sound effects. The trailer narrator is poor and that is also the intro of the game, but what is hands down unbearable in this game is the monster sound effects. All of them sound like they come out of a speaker then recorded back in to the speaker. There isn't a precise sound with them, they sound muffled and sound really low quality. Furthermore, many of the monster sounds all blend together and when they make their noise each time they attack you, it can be annoying at times.Wrap up: I had my eyes on this game many years ago and have been following along on it ever since.  I am having fun with the game more so now that the story is opening up. Yes the fetch quests and kill quests at the beggining make you wonder why exactly you are doing it, but after the first story sequence I am more inclined to press forward. I do like exploring each and every map for the goodies. There is a certain rewarding feeling of leveling up your charachter and equipping new loot along the way. For people that love loot and customizing their hero, this will be a rewarding game for you. I feel like if you know there is going to be a slow start to the game, I would say pick it up!  If I get the time I will definitely add a quick lookish video tomorrow letting you visually see what it is I am talking about. I haven't even gotten a chance to dive in to the rogue like modes (that is initially why I was interested in the game in the first place many years ago) or the endless mode. There is a lot of content here to be had, perhaps Grim Bros should have really nailed one gameplay option?			"

												This game is…meh. It’s something to play if you are bored. Would have made an excellent cell phone game. PositivesVery easy to pick up and put downMany creative weapons and equip able items (can’t see them on character though, which is probably a good thing considering some of the items)Pretty graphics for a simple gameNegativesAll missions are the same, or at least they are where I am at. You either have to find a certain number of items/people or kill a certain number of enemies/boss. Not that thrilling.  There are the crafting and fishing missions, but if you aren’t in a spot where those supplies are at, you aren’t going to be able to work on them.  There isn’t any incentive to level up, because the enemies level up with you.Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! Turning off that special graphic thingie (very technical, I know, but I don’t remember what it was) helped immensely. But the main map freezes still. Thankfully there is an autosave function every time you enter a new room.  Crafting- it’s fun, until you realize that you just spent a good 10-20 minutes, creating the ingredients for the weapon you want, only to realize after you have created that special weapon that you are too under leveled to use it.  And don’t even get me started on finding the crafting ingredients. The digging is very random, so if you are trying to make a particular item, it’s going to take you a lot of digging to find it. Which I suppose is realistic, but I’m playing as an alcoholic red riding hood. I’m not going for realism here . Though I wouldn’t mind the shovel being more like a real shovel. I don’t understand why the shovel is a consumable item.  Graphics- weather events can obscure them, which makes it annoying. Storyline-not that great. It’s not very storyline intensive, as far as I can tell. It’s definitely not humorous. I don’t remember laughing at anything in this game actually.  "

												I watched a friend play this on Twitch and I fell in love with it without even trying it.  I immediately recognised it as a traditional, old school Roguelike game, and being a fan of that genre I'm finding it amusing how game reviews keep describing it as a blend of Tactical RPG and Roguelike, or a blend of Chrono Trigger and Diablo, or whatever.  Naw, it's straight up old school Roguelike gameplay, and I love it.I keep picking up hints that this is a game made by people who love video games, just little references to other games here and there.  This makes the game very enjoyable for me.I'm actually playing it on a computer that's not at all deisgned for gaming (a bargain bin, single core laptop) and the game is playing just fine, minus some lengthly loading times.  Since it's a turn based game I can't see this being much of a problem.  So good job!My only complaints just far, echoing some of the others I've read, is that there's no way to rebind keys.  The game also promises quite a bit of replay value, and I hope it lives up to its promise.If you like old school Roguelike you'll probably love this game.  If you like contemporary roguelikes and want to try something fun with an old school flavour then I would highyl recommend this title.			"

												Poor controls lead to frustrating fights at times.Other than that, it's a cute roguelike game that can be brutally hard in some areas out of nowhere.  Sometimes, you'll be hit by a mob and you won't know where it came from (ranged attack).  Graphically the game looks like a flash game from a tablet and you can tell too because the options don't allow for mouse scrolling right now.  It's a downvote for me right now due to the bad controls and the price.  On a tablet, this would be 5 bucks.  But since we get the ""privelege"" of 1080p we have to pay nearly 20 dollars for this.

												Simply put: this game is not worth $22.00, and I would only recommend this game if it appeals to you AND is offered at $10.00 or less (at which point I will switch my rating and judge less harsh in my review)PROS:- Feels very satisfying being able to 'kite' enemies with your shotgun blasts with AoE damage while your pets soak up damage. Best feature hands down.- The characters have solid amount of energy in dialogue and art.- Unlockable playable characters for replay value.- Music is surprisingly impressive.CONS:-  There is a huge lack of a main objective/plot/quest. I've spent the entire game so far just talking to a bar owner for pointless side quests (it's the only way to progress).- Lack of wit in dialogues, which is odd/disappointing for these types of games.- Animations are played at ~6 frames/second and it makes it feel like a RPG Maker game.- Being ""turn-based"" means nothing. It feels weird and unnecessary; playing it in real time would make the game feel smoother and take away only a very small amount of strategy.			"

												This game does still need some interface and visual tweaks, but overall it's well done and fun. I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from. Maybe the recent updates fixed a lot of problems that I never saw.I'm about 6.5 hours in to it and like it quite a bit. You are based out of a small town and go on quests that the towns people give you. Most of the the quests are a stand-alone rogue-ish missions with one or more dungeon-type levels (some are outdoors). You can fail missions but you do not permanently die unless you select hardcore mode or whatever it's called.One of the main things I like about it is the number of gear slots. There are about 15, including four rings. You are not showered with loot but there is enough to keep it interesting. I'm level 15 and only have 2 skills so far. I'm not even sure how I got them. There are a bunch of slots for skills so I assume there are many more but I don't know how to get them. I should probably read the manual...			"

												So far I am almost 5 hours in and I am having a great time with this almost hidden gem. What drew me in at first was the artstyle of the game. It is pretty unique as it is colorful, appealing, and professional all at the same time. As a fan of rogue-likes, I can appreciate that they give you an option whether you want your death to be game over or let you continue. As this game also contains a story with humorous and witty dialogue, I found myself taking the time to read the story whereas otherwise I would not in a game of this genre. I like how there are many equipment slots to fill, there are tons of different items, the combat so far is simple yet fun. I just now found some combat spells so I have a feeling there is more to combat than meets the eye. So overall the game is engaging and I am having a great time exploring all the randomly generated areas for loot. There are also multiple game modes to try out such as labrynth and I think another was endless. So from what I see this game has a lot to offer. The devs also seem to really care about the community by listening to their suggestions and implementing fixes promptly. I will be looking forward to more games from this company!			"

												So, I have a few things to say about this game.I have to give credit in a couple areas, but unfortunately it just doesn't save the game for me. The music is pretty good, the art is really cute and aethetically pleasing. I've only played for a couple hours, but to be honest I couldn't really stomach playing it for longer.Why?The movement feels clunky. Despite watching videos and other people stream the game, I still wasn't sure in the end if I was even playing the game ""right."" It felt uncomfortable and was not easy to slide in to, as it should be. The writing is done in such a way that it almost treats the audience as if they are dumb, and cannot infer information based on decently written dialogue. The mini map was not helpful or well ""mapped out"" at all. I had no idea what the game was trying to indicate to me with its' little green squares for everything they were trying to mark. Further, a little bit of a pet peeve about this game: you have to pay money if you damage stuff. That sounds logical maybe, but listen -- most of us have been conditioned to break things if we see we are damaging them. We want to see what goodies are inside! (I broke a stump had to pay money. You should be paying me; I removed that nuisance from your yard.) And due to this mechanic, I basically started the game bankrupt. Furthermore, what I was doing felt empty. Boring. Pointless. I didn't feel engaged. Make it matter to me, because right now, it just doesn't. I did have some interaction with the devs and I have to say that for the most part, they are some pretty nice people. Unfortunately, that doesn't make for what I consider to be a ""good game"", all due respect.			"

												Very charming little roguelike, but I would wait for a sale.


YouTube™ Video: Let's Play Dragon Fin Soup - Pt. 1 - The Color of Rum 1080p 60fps 

			Views: 315		

			Short introduction to the game. I'll be actually reading through the readme before playing the next part.		

While the combat itself is not on the same level of complexity as something like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, ADOM, ect. There is still a decent amountof depth to it in terms of equipment, spells and unlockables.The art direction, monster design and soundtrack are fantastic and the story isn't so bad either. The characters are unique and while at first I thought I was going to get tired of the main character due to her being described as a raging alcoholic, I was pleasantly surprised that she ends up being funny and not at all annoying.The other reviews mention the controls being sluggish but I found that all movement and actions were actually very smooth, I was playing with a keyboard and WASD though. I've never played a roguelike with a controller before but I might check it out and update this review with a look at that.Overall, if you're into coffee break roguelikes then I'd highly recommend this but if you were looking for something with a staggering amount character builds and backbreaking difficulty I would hold out for something else. It resembles games like Sproggiwood more so than KeeperRL/ Caves of Qud/ Ect.			"

												Dragon Fin Soup is an AWESOME game. I was an early Kickstarter campaign contributor and I've never regretted it. First off, this game is terrific if you're a strategic gamer, but you still like games like Diablo. Because each step is a turn, it is very easy to stop the action any time you need to and the game goes at the speed that YOU decide. The crafting system is really top notch. All in all I have really enjoyed the game and thoroughly recommend it!!			"

Posted: November 4, 2015
												To sum up: It looks good but feels wrong. It feels like a casual game and a bad port and something that could be fun.I hope the devs polish this a lot.  The PC release needs to play well on a PC.  Let's start with some basic things, controls.  Though the devs have stated that the pc is their primary platform, they don't play by longstanding pc conventions.  What do you expect 'esc' to do in a game for pc? Nothing? Oh, wait, it exits menus, but does not bring up an options menu with load and save and most importantly - quit?!   How about ""alt-tab'?  In full screen, nothing, nada, zilch.  That's not right. In a roguelike, dungeon crawler, rpg, etc, pushing the ""i"" key should bring you to your inventory.  And it should be customisable.  These are only a few of the issues.  All in all it feels like a bad port made primarily for gamepads or touchscreens. I play with mouse and keyboard and have the option of a touchscreen.  Touchscreen is too tedious and not precise enough for the action.  Mouse and keyboard are awkward.  Moving by mouse click will have you fined your hard earned gold when you accidentally cut down city trees (Protip: some things are worth smashing in town once you have some money to pay for it).  Moving by WASD and QEZC for diagonals is much better, with enter for attacking the selected target, though that requires the occasional mouse use to point your character in the right direction.  For a game that require precision to survive, the controls don't always allow it.  Then there's the camera...Though the difficulty ramps up appropriately for its genre, it doesn't feel very satisfying when you die or lose your comrades to clicking on an iceblock instead of the ghost next to it.  The terrain needs to turn transparent at a distance, not when standing directly under/north of/next to it.  And it seems that this ""feature"" is used in the dungeons fairly often to hide treasure and treasure rooms.  I found myself playing by the minimap too much, which just can't be right given the work put into the look of the game.  And sadly, once you remove that aesthetic, DFS doesn't compare well to other roguelikes out there.  The limitiations of the character, the apparent lack of content (linear progression), and the awkward controls really let it down.Oh, and the fishing minigame is broken out of the gate (to be patched soon according to the forums.)The menus UI must be improved.  It can easily be slimmed down.  There are three, possibly four, screens that could be combined into one.  The inventory screen is pointless; it might as well be merged with the equipment screen.  The pets screen could be merged too, since your pets are just another item.  The other item management screen, crafting, has its own issues - far too many clicks, no recipe automation - and realistically could be merged with inventory too, though that might confuse the already awkward controls.  One glaring fault in the crafting menu is no easy transition to equipment.  If I make something worthwhile I probably want to put it on as quickly as possible.  There is wasted space on the left hand side, why not have my equipment over there so I can try on my new stuff?  Or, if that isn't feasible, and I admit it would start to look a bit too cluttered, how about a button that brings me straight to my equipment menu like the one that the redundant inventory menu has?Crafting is dull, awkward (again) and a bit of a grind.  When you finally do make something interesting you probably can't use it for some time.  I have some cargo pants that must wait to wear because I was half the appropriate level when I made them.  Finally putting them together was a genuinely exciting moment.  But now I must be very patient.  To wear cargo pants... As far as awkward goes, it is far better with mouse than with gamepad.  But it can still be imroved.  Right click, shift click, alt click, ctrl click,middle click, even double left click could move the ingredient into the crafting station.  Instead we right click the ingredient, move the mouse to find the occasionally different location of the move ingredient button, then left click that button.  You do this over and over again to level up your abilities to craft something that might be useful.  You can slowly drag and drop too, but both of these options are inferior to a simple double or single click.This particular problem has been solved, before.  Why are we reinventing the wheel of inventory management with every game?  The right click context menu of move, eat, exit menu, and trash is unnecessary and slows every process down.  Perhaps it works for gamepads but it's a step backward for the rest of us.  A trash can in the corner works fine for the few times you need to use it.  I doubt it requires the 25%-33% attention that the right click context menu affords it.  And the buttons moving around are just... aweful.  On the far right hand side, I have to be very careful not to throw my gear away, because the context menu buttons are suddenly in a different place to account for the side of the screen.  And they change based on edibility.  There are no takebacks for trashed items.  Combine that with the massive amounts of item sorting for successful crafting/ingredient storage = headache.Skills also need improving.  They have short descriptions but no NUMBERS!  I must open my equipment, look at my wall of numbers, exit to the game, use the skill, open back to my equipment and then compare to see what it did.  Why not just tell me in the first place?  Once again, this problem has been solved before.  The devs say it is not a casual game, but the text only descriptions of skills says something else.  Skills are also gained entirely at random, which brings me to leveling.Leveling.  This is where it feels most casual.  Sometimes I get +1 attack from a level.  Sometimes I get +1 in six or seven other areas too.  It isn't obvious why this is happening.   I assume it is based on what skills you have used.  This leads to the following scenario:  if you spent a character level (or ten)  doing very well and killing enemies before they can damage you, then you won't improve your armor skills, leaving you out of luck later on in the game.  Your character doesn't progress in any other way.  There are no skill trees, classes, abilities, perks.  None of that.  You find random skills in crates.  For a game with an ""adult humor"" veneer, that feels very immature in a game design way, not much substance, it starts to veer into a territory that is very shallow, very...  casual.  Combat is hampered by all of the above.  Also, when you heal or find an item or skill, there is a very annoying popup (can i get a popup blocker for this game?) that hangs around for a little too long.  It is directly over your character, stopping all action.  Put that information to the side where it belongs, color coded to show health and items different from damage rolls.  There are also obnoxious popups for leaving areas.  If I walk through a doorway I don't want to confirm.  If I speak to a vendor I don't want to confirm.All in all, this game seems to have gone through production without quality feedback.  Some of these design choices are obviously wrong for the medium.  Escape should bring up an options menu so we can quit easily (and seek a refund, perhaps).  You don't hide it in a submenu of to the side.  Furthermore, game design according to the popup ads industry is a huge annoyance for everyone.  Keep things smooth.  It all leaves me my scratching my head, and by the length of this review, for clearly too long.  That said I am still trying to play it and I am having some occasional fun.  There seems to be some fun to be had here, but the tools to scratch that itch are all wrong and somewhat painful.  Much of this is cosmetic. Some is substantial.  For me, it is death by a thousand cuts.			"

												Okie... time to review this one. My friend DeltaBladeX recommend this game to me when I was in pure boredom of massive shards of Eador and dealing with the suprised long maps of King's bounty Warrior of north. He said Dragon Fin Soup is short and fun or something like that. So here I went. Great drawing of graphics, Cool music and neat interface is the first impression. The addicting Crafting system bring me the same kind of weird enjoyment of playing world builder games. I admit it's quite fun at first then the difficulty wall of further level hit me. The Control became a massive pain and ultimatly draged this game down. You can use both keyboard and mouse to move and hit. On town map you are fine but mouse is impossible to use during a battle situation map since a lot things can happen very quickly. And keyboard you have to be very careful and click the arrow button 1 at a time. If you don't you can lose several turn really in a flash and instantly die from a bomb from a random small enemy.You basicly have to use everything you find make to survive constantly. There is no save except ironman autosave. One tiny mistake you are dead.. and have to start all over again. Lacking a soft save and the hard difficulty of this rogue like ironman game made me gave up on it even though I did like it a lot at the beginning. Another thing is crafting became less and less useful as i progress in the game. Since my inventory is constantly carrying as much consumable, bomb, bullet and things to sale instead of focusing on garthing. Most things you need you will find in shop. If you don't find the good one. just map hoping and go back to the shop to have it's inventory refreshed.5/10 is my final rating for a game i decided to gave up on. I really cannot recommend this to anyone as it may bring them rage instead of joy but I do think the sound/music/character are done really well that needs to be appreciated. Coin toss gave it a thumb down so here it is.			"

												I was a bit reluctant to try this due to the negative reviews but I really love this game. 3 different play modes, the story mode which is more like an actual RPG where you can save your progress, survival mode and labyrith which are the rogue-like modes. They're all very enjoyable. I like the jokes in the game and the fact that Robin is based on Little Red Riding Hood, who acts nothing like her. I believe later on you can also unlock other characters. C: The developers are also working hard on improving the game. The interface is personally not an issue for me at all and the controls are very smooth, especially like the fact I can basically do anything with my mouse if I wanted. And might I add that I absolutely love the title screen music. I recommend you guys make a DLC for the game's music sometime.			"

												An excellent rogue-like game that mixes in strategy and delivers it with a great sense of humor and visually pleasing graphics.  If you are a fan of rogue-like games or prefer your protagonists to have a drinking problem, give this game a shot.  Combat in this game is challenging and worthwhile encouraging you to play it safe and plan out your moves instead of charging in head first.  You will have your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you continually but if you are patient you can get the job done.I wasn't expecting this game to grab me as it has.  Soon after quiting it I am tempted to start playing it again.  Oh and alcohol is used to restore HP, just like in real life.			"

												Usually I don't write reviews, but I feel like I have to in this case because the overall rating is just not justified imo (since apparently most of the negative reviews seem to be from an early stage of the game).Pros:+Addictive gameplay (slay enemies, collect loot, level up your char, get better gear etc.)+Sh!t tons of content for a supposedly little indie game (lots of different: maps/places, enemies, items, amount of craftable items etc.)+Funny dialogues and NPC names+Several gamemodes+Storymode takes quite a while to complete+Discworld references (the world is placed on the back of a giant turtle swimming through the multiverse!)Cons:-Lack of proper instructions in the beginning and a not very helpful help-menu (controls seem to be terribad first, but they're easy-po-peeze once you figured them out) -♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu-controls-Missions are rather simple and become repetitive after a while-UI lacks infos (for example, if you attempt to craft a weapon, it doesnt show its stats or level requirement...so you often end up crafting stuff that turns out to be worthless junk)Big phat thumbs up from me!!1!1			"

												I followed this game since the KS campaign and didn't have a chance to play until I read some negative reviews. While I played little and can't say anything about the end-game, or even mid-game, I have to agree with some of the negative points of the game. In particular the absence of tutorial or instructions. I will have later to google around to understand what is the rage bar for example. Although there are little flaws, the game seems really funny and I like the graphic style. The absence of permadeath in the normal campaign is a bonus as I like to play a roguelike but without the stress that my next step will be the last one. For whoever instead loves that adrenaline, is plenty of other modes I didn't explore with increasing difficulty and permadeath. The combat works quite well but YOU HAVE to read the manual because is not overly intuitive. Another thing I noticed is that when you walk the objects in front of you fade to keep the focus always on the main character. You have to get used to it because it could mean that you try to reach a destination towards the bottom of the screen and get stuck before realising there is an obstacle in front of you. But as I said nothing here so far tells me that this is not a game I would recommend. I'm liking it and I will update this review when I'll get to mid-game. Kudos to the developers to keep improving this game!			"

												I watched the trailer and I was expecting to see tactical turn-based combat, boss fights, puzzles, interesting combat system and a neat story.I was severely disappointed. Most of the enemies go down by clicking mouse button and using 'health potion' untill they die. I was hoping for more tactical approach where you needed to think what to do next. The game has bombs, ranged weapons and spells, but you don`t need to use them. It is easier to just spam left mouse button. The ammo is limited and it is too much hassle stocking it or switching between ammo types. Bombs are somewhat usefull because they do lot of damage.Spells? Basically I am 11h in game at level 32 and I have found 3 spells. Two of them are useless and just give a little protection against certain elements. One of them gives damage boost, but you also take more damage. If they gave me some usefull spells at the beginning it would spice up the gameplay or maybe even somekind of special attack. No such luck.Story is a lackluster. Basically you do random chores until you get something story related. The chores are mostly about rescuing some random person and then getting 500g as reward. Resurrecting a pet costs 10k gold. You get jack-smith with 500g. With minor changes the game would have gotten positive review from me. Biggest problem is that it is repetive, and no new tools are introduced after 30 mins of gameplay. I will probably force myself to finish this or wait for the big patch.			"

												There is a good game in here, and with some changes to gameplay a really good game could be found.Note, this is my first experience with a game that has rougelike elements.Main points:PROSNice art style and music. They both do exactly what is needed and compliment each other. Decent core gameplay that is quite fun once you understand what is going on.CONSNEEDS TUTORIAL. Not everyone has time to read through a manual, or can remember it all. There are many mechanics working together that need to be explained in a methodical manner. Simple way to incorporate into the story are: flashback sequences, training areas, or simple pop up boxes when you first encounter a  new mechanic.You can get stuck behind seemingly invisible walls randomly, only to realise that a part of the environment is in front of you, but it has turned invisible to show you where your character is. Once this is destroyed you can continue.The opening sequences heavily imply of an overall lore and a story to be told about the main character. Yet 3 hours in, I have yet to actually start anything resembling a main quest. All quests so far have been essentially side quests. There was even a moment after around 2 hours there was story progression (expected to be given a proper quest) I was then told to do more side quests... Overall the main issues are all related to the game mechanics not being explained to the player. This would sort out 80% of issues. It's all the little things that add up, like the fact that within 20 mins of starting the game I had minus 64 gold because I accidentally caused property damage... This was not explained. Or I have died in battles with no idea of how I died. Or why I can't use a power crystal thing to upgrade a weapon (even after following on-screen instructions). Or how I assumed I could sleep in my bed to recover HP (but can't), however health recovers outside of battle slowly (never explained).Once this is fixed, and story/plot progression is sorted, this would be a great game.

												I have to admit, it's a more fun than it was on day one. Sadly if i had given up on day one like a lot of others, they might not have seen what the game is really like. But overall it has a complexity to it that you don't see in a lot of rogue likes.So for me the Pro's would be-Crafting, while complex unlike a lot of others that require a lottery of luck to get the pieces you need it gives you the opportunity to explore and destroy almost your entire surroundings to find what you might need to make the gear you want and what you don't find through luck you can often times buy from npcs.The con of that system though is this-Though the crafting system could be happier if just when on that screen right clicking an item would send it to the crafting forge instead of click and drag.The pro's of fighting are-It tells you pretty much at the start, you can move and even shoot diagonally up to a point with certain weapons. The pet system for tanks and sometimes even higher more sustained damage than you have, they heal quickly and while you can only have two you can carry more pets in your inventory should one be knocked out. Pet's don't die they can be revived in town, while i cannot say for certain this is the same in endless dungeon or survival mode that just means you have to be more protective and careful just like any other rogue like game.-Weapons all have their own way to fight with them, some have multiple attacks others just one harsh hard fit, axes swing realisticly all around you and spears pierce through targets in a line.Con's of it sadly are- Not being able to easily distinguish pet's health bar, your own health bar apart from enemies. Being different colors might help but for now it's easiest to just look below at the bigger health bar for you but that doesnt help your pets.- Sometimes it can be hard to see if an enemy is on the same line as you to attack it horizontally, but the minimap does help you figure that out as well partly.Overall though from what i've seen the game is rather fluid, it punishes you at times but if you are careful and have a mind for rogue likes and learn how to cheat your way out of circumstances, and there are times I do recommend running to find that nook and cranny you need to fight those hardest of enemies, or to get back and regenerate your health because of something unexpected, if you like rogue likes give it a shot when it's on sale because so far i've enjoyed my time with it and the quirky characters to it and even if you just play it because it's a rogue like while I can't say as of yet it will get as many hours out of me as ""faster than light, rogue legacy, our darker purpose, binding of isaac"" it will make me play it to completion and likely play through it again through the non story modes afterwards for a true roguelike experience.

Dragon Fin Soup is delicious, but a niche game.Let's start with the fact that I have enjoyed the game so far, and I can recommend it even with some little flaws. You are interested about the flaws ofc, right? But let's start what makes Dragon Fin Soup so delicious and pretty addictive. I have mostly played the story mode.First thing which hits the honey spot for me is the atmosphere of the game. The charming and pretty unique graphics and the sweet♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack makes me grin, and even those together makes the game's fantasy world feel unique and alive.The level of detail in the game is pretty impressive too; furnitures inside houses + lot of detail on all the models: like character models, deep crafting system, tons of stuff to equip and use, minigames, traps and secrets etc. There are also three game modes; Story mode which is more like regular RPG and  then endless labyrinth + survival modes where you can unlock more characters and play those more like roguelike game.The humor of the game is spot on with funny equipments, references to other games and tv shows, and goofy characters. Most of the characters are also pretty memorable and the main character Red Robin is one of them + she is pretty damn likable too. The flaws what I can think about after the updates are; No key binding option in the game yet (you can remap the keys from config file though), a bit clunky options menu (and some other menus for some ppl) and the weather effects and other effects makes it sometimes hard to see what is happening in the game. The devs have been pretty active though and they plan to update the game further what I have heard, so some of these things might change for better in future.This game is damn charming and, if you like turn-based RPGs/roguelike games, you should pick this up. Especially, if the game is on sale. However...because this is a niche game and have some flaws, the game isn't everyones cup of soup. That's why I highly recommend you to check out the tutorial video of the game which gives you pretty detailed idea how the game works. :)

												A promising game but with MANY flaws. The game mechanics are good, the random dungeons are well generated it looks great and it captures that classic turn based dungeon crawler feel complete with hidden traps and teleports, chests and gold galore and even a few puzzles here and there to solve.BUT it's got a few flaws1. 1st off there is an annoying one second delay between attacks! But the devs reckon they will be fixing this so we'll see.2. crafting is pointless since you get the equips and ammo anyway in the dungeons.3. if you do attempt to craft you'll find a terrible system instead. Instead of everything being in categories and easy to find it's all in 1 big long list that you have to scroll up and down through which is just frustrating as hell! Also some of the recipes to make stuff like bombs and ammo are just ridiculously stupid it's far easier just to pick up the drops in dungeons. This alone makes you avoid the craft system.4. if you use liquor to heal if you drink too much you go nuts and start running around doing nothing while the mobs continuously attack you and you die! My advice get the healing spells FAST than just sell all your liquor from there on!If you have to play this do it with a controller (logitech f710 works great) and ignore the crafting system and it's actually quite playable. You'll be back for more with the insanely hard survival mode (you'll be lucky to survive 5 floors!) as well as endless dungeon modes!			"

												Long story short - controls kill fun.U should know this before buying. U cannot redefine controls in this game, and the deafult layout is too clunky for me - nine movement buttons, eight skill buttons, no chance to open game menu ingame. Also, I couldn't use mouse to attack or interact for some reason, so it had to be an Enter key. Considering u still need a mouse ingame, playing with both hands on a keyboard is not an option.			"

												I do not recomend this game. It is boring after the first couple of hours. It felt like rinse wash repeat. Pets are nice and a huge help, but if they die, they will quickly be to low lved to help anymore. The labrynth mode, well, most characters are pretty much reskins, or have very slightly different options. The controls, could use some improvement. *shrugs* Not really much to say about it otherwise, just do yourself a big favor and check out some of the other reviews for a better analyses.The devs seemed to have abandoned the game from the way the forums sound.

												I think the art in this game is good, which is what initially drew me into this game. However, the implementation of the UI, and the clunky introduction (couldn't find the tavern for 10 minutes, which is the first ""quest""!). The player is introduced to too many things at once (level 40 crafting recipes at level 3, tons of stats, etc). Plus, I racked up a debt of -200 gold when I first stepped into town due to chopping a tree down or something.I think that this game holds promise, but needs to be polished design and usability wise. Especially the beginning.			"

												The game's core gameplay and concept is really good, artwork is superb but there's a lot of issues that needs to be fixed and addressed before this game was fully ready for release. Because of this, the game feels rushed.The UI and controls are somewhat confusing for me at first but I quickly got accustomed to it and I currently play mainly in keyboard. For a rougelike game, it is missing monster encyclopedias. The guide in-game is not detailed enough. The quests are somewhat a chore. I only played for 3 hours but when the game fails to hook me on their story, there is definitely something wrong on the pacing on the quests.The graphics and artwork style is really nice, but you're going to need to get accustomed on the map to notice the nuances of where are the traps are activated and if there are objects blocking your path and etc. There is no rotate so you definitely need to somewhat focus on the map. It is turn based so there's no need to rush.AI is not good, I would rather have all my companions on manual mode than relying on AIs, especially if I wanted to play on permadeath modeThe combat log is plain, it's just white, not even colored to differentiate ally, enemy names, damage values and status ailments received/inflictedFinally, no steam cloud save support atm. How can I seamlessly load my gameplay from my Desktop PC to my laptop when I'm on University/travel?			"

												Ive followed this game for a couple years honestly, long before it was even greenlit. Thing is, when the game was pitched it was a novel concept, during the roguelike boom they wanted to do a story driven tactical rpg roguelike with gorgeous graphics, a sense of humor, and a whole bucket of other interesting features. Their development cycle was so slow, and the game ended up being so derivative and mediocre that when it was finally released it was frustrating and forgettable. Everything it did had already been done, and done better.It hasn't aged gracefully either. The developers are uncommunicative, slow, and honestly just crap at their job. Their homepage is covered in spam & popups, and the Extra Chunky Edition that was supposed to be out by the end of the year is nowhere to be ♥♥♥♥ing seen. Honestly you'd think everyone working on the project was a hobbyist at this point. "

												""elchali_5"" has a pretty good review written up, so I won't bother repeating all of the issues they listed. You should give it a read if you haven't.  I'd just like to add that the tutorial for the game is an external YouTube video. It's 50 minutes long and is done by an extremely amateur sounding voice actress that got on my nerves right away. I couldn't make it through much of the video so I tried just playing the game without it, but it felt like I was missing a million and one should-be-obvious things.Everything about this game screams bad mobile port; it's just missing the micro transactions.

												I wanna like this game. I really really do. I got hyped for it when I saw it at PAX Prime the past two years cause the story and character(s) seemed fresh and new.Unfortunately, for the price I paid, the game is severly lacking. The UI is clunky, the crafting system is burdensome and impossible to manage (500+ recipes /all/ of which have to be learned by discovering them in the world if you don't look them up on random forums). The story line hasn't progressed and currently I'm level 33 without any idea of where the writers/developers planned to progress the story.It has been a never ending series of fetch quests and rescue missions and none of them progress the story. Not being able to map keybinds is also frustrating as there are quite a few menus to make use of. The manual is extremely short and not nearly detailed enough. I still have no idea the purpose of the rage bar or what monster defenses are like. I'm hack and slashing through combat hoping for the best even though I'm a min/max player.Robin is such a cool and interesting character but this game doesn't do her any justice and she doesn't get nearly drunk enough (plus the dialogue feels flavorless). Has literally felt like I'm continually going back and forth to the den of evil over and over again and I'll never even get to andarial... if you get the d2 reference.I will definitely revisit the review if any of my suggestions are taken into account but in the mean time I have to shelf this game since it's not just doing it for me. I'm surprised none of these issues (and others) were considered considering how many times this game was ""delayed"" for release.Also I still have no reason why I ate a pair of leather pants that seemed pretty good. Why that's available is beyond me.			"

The problem is I just cant control it for anything. It would take a lot of time and patience to learn how to control my character perfectly. Time that just is not worth it for the game. It is a turn base game but you go by turns so fast that it just feels rushed. Also longer loading times than expected.			"

												EDIT: I emailed the developers, and they kindly refunded me through Humble Bundle. Thank you to them for that. If the game drastically improves, I will be back.I was quite excited for Dragon Fin Soup, but sadly I am a bit dissapointed. To sum up my feelings and issues with the game, I believe the developer team tried to capture too-wide of an audience (ie. they apparently are using nearly all platforms). When you overstretch like this, I think quality is lost. Trying to find balance between catering to a hardcore roguelike market as well as traditional console RPG people, and not mention perhaps mobile crowds.  For example, they brag 'roguelike' features, but as everybody knows this is a buzzword that gets thrown around too loosely. As I explain below, they do improve on some features from that genre, but it falls short in other areas and of overall being totally addictive. Another issue is that the graphics look uncomfortably close to mobile, with few-frame sprites and such. The artwork that is there is really good, but not in an indie-hit kind of way. Perhaps the game is amazing after 10 or 20 hours, but from what I have seen, I am not sure I am willing to sit through much more.Pros:+They totally nailed finding a great mixture of turn-based gameplay while making it look smooth and real time. When things get hectic, you can get all stratetic a la ToME, but when running across the map you would never guess its turn-based.+Artwork is quite good, although it reminds me of mobile.+The story is quite charming (at least <2 hours in).+Seems to have a lot of depth (and the developers claim this), although I cannot speak past what I have playedCons:-The fundamental controls could use some work. For example, you cannot attack diaganol, which is a fairly staple function in  classic roguelikes. Controls are not rebindable (c'mon this is a PC game for nearly 20$). Keyboard shortcuts were not listed anywhere that I could find (...Which should be really accessible), and they were'nt always the best design choice. If we are supposed to play this for 60+ hours, it better be comfortable.-All of the trees and bushes look beautiful and are fun to interact with at first, but end up feeling like garbage you need to wade through on the map.-Music IMO was meh. Once again probably great for mobile standards (Yes, I know this is not a mobile game... Yet).-Walls often covered chests up - walls should probably gain transparency when you are near.-Icons on the minimap are really too small. Even when you push 'tab' and it gets larger, it does not help much.-A very minor 'Con', but yet a point: the developer team may be too small to actually be able to handle and push forward this game on so many platforms. What you get now is probably what you will have forever, sans some minor bug fixes. I know this is a full version, which is cool, but I don't expect the kind of TLC that games like Crypt of the Necrodancer recieved.Really, I could overlook some of the issues if the price-point weren't so dang high. I bought on HumbleBundle and therefore cannot refund - I have buyers remorse at this point. I will play a bit longer to try to find some magic that I missed, but at this time I cannot recommend this to my Steam friends.			"

												An American-style Mystery dungeon game. For those of you unfamiliar with the genre, think any game that has the words mystery dungeon in it or Spike-Chunsoft's Shiren the Wanderer series. Turn based rogue lite with a very funny story of an alcoholic that's trying to remember her past. I have played this game at PAX while they were still working on it, spoke with one of the devs regarding JPN localization and I'm really glad that they followed through with it. I have recommended the game then, and I will still recommend the game now. Some minor issues with the UI as some people have mentioned where the KB/M controls are a bit heavy on the mouse (navigating menus) but putting that aside, it is a great title to have if you enjoy the mystery dungeon style games.

												I tried so hard to like this game, but it refuses at every turn to actually like you back. Period.Last patch fixed a bunch of things that made the game unbearable to play, but now that the controls aren't wonky anymore it's just the game itself that's unbearable and that isn't fixable.Game decides to start pitting you against things 5+ levels above you almost immediately. Spent the last hour trying to not die on a randomly generated map involving werewolves that would spawn with no warning completely surrounding you and making it impossible to not just eat attacks from all sides until you die. Provides no information on your goals, or how to possibly make things easier for yourself, or possibly explain to you why maybe it's you that sucks at the game.Can't change any of your options once you start the game, you have to save, quit to menu, edit things from the menu and very likely have to restart the game entirely just to change those settings.Menu navigation is still garbage, entering or closing out of menus takes multiple clicks and the game often gets mad at you for attempting to use the mouse despite it generally being required.May be the worst thing I've Kickstarted so far.

												Note this is my 2 cents worth, not a complex evaluation,  about what makes this game less than the fun it should be for me...you're apt. to get different mileage depending on how much or how limited your values on what a game should or should not be are.First off let me say that it's a cute game with cheerful music. Yes, BUT music that loops until you end up turning it off to save your sanity! Fighting involves mostly just mashing buttons & drinking life potions in order not to die while killing enemies...meh.Another thing I really can't see the sense in is your pet dying and costing thousands to re-spawn it...just plain crap...hell let the pet run away if it's injured until it heals itself. Everytime I speak to the quack Dr. about healing my pet the price goes up...even if he hasn't healed the pet the last time I talked to him WTF!Quests are very repetative in nature and this quickly becomes tedious and boring. Conversations are also repetivtive and boring and I only have 12.5 hours in at this time:(Now I'm not going to nitpick every little thing that's wrong here because most of it has been said in other reviews. But I'll wind this up with one last thing that bugs the hell out of me! If I had relized before purchasing this game that it requires a connection in order to be played I wouldn't have bothered with it at all!!!			"

												At this point, I would just sound like a broken record by repeating what has already been said. So, with that said, I have to agree with the points that have already been stated. To me, personally, the game just felt a bit clunky, the UI not very intuitive (at least on the computer), and there just seemed to be a lot of clutter on screen that just killed the overall experience for me. In the end, I got a refund due to the the underwhelming experience the few minutes I played this game gave me. Though I hadn't been following this project for very long, I've been trying to experience and support games that have rogue-like elements in them, and I desperately wanted to like this game since it definitely seemed to appeal to me. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case this time.			"

												Alright I change my upvote to a downvote. First I was impressed by the jokes and the graphics and everything. But I just don't understand so many things in this game. Where do I have to go? Where is everything? Why does my wolf die in 2 attacks and recovernig it costs 400 gold if I only find 20 gold in a mission?I just don't get this game it's very confusing. I would love for it to be like diablo 1 - A starting town with 3 traders and 1 quest givers right next to each others and then one portal to a neverending dungeon.			"

												Bought this game after seeing their booth at Momocon 2016.  I am only a few hours in, but so far I love it. Gameplay harkens back to the rogue-likes of yore, and the graphics are beautiful. any one that enjoyed Road Not Taken, Crypt of the Necrodancer, etc, should definetely give it a shot.			"

												Let's say Dragon Fin Soup is a strategy game where your main goal (besides the own missions that the game gives you) is to stay alive, or rather, not to kill yourself with your own bomb.  Dragon Fin Soup excels in its genre for the simple fact of the existence of multiple modes, generalized maps (something very flashy) and the feeling evolve over time (what people these days look for in a rpg).

												Hmm, what to say the game is kinda fun, though just about everything in the game is also awkward and at times super frustrating. They had a cool concept but it just doesn't mesh well into a great gaming experince. Maybe if they get the feedback they should have gotten when the game was in tested the things that are awkward would have been changed. The controls are one of the worst parts of this game, which only makes the negitive parts worse. Comeback to the game in a few months, maybe it will be worth the time and money.			"

												I waited for Dragon Fin Soup for what, like 2 years?! Obviously it was an insta-purchase for me but oh boy what a let down it was. As a fan of the roguelike genre - both old and new - I felt that DFS offered the option for perma-death just to be able to call itself a roguelike.  The movement/attacking is grid- and turnbased but you don't see the grid which led to some very clunky moving. Obviously I couldn't go very indebth with my game time but felt that if the game is annoying and clunky in the beginning it's not worth my time. Reminded me of Dungeons of Dredmor, that's a plus.

Gameplay:It's okay, but feels a little thin.  Using a shotgun and certain abilities feels pretty satisfying, but the melee combat is pretty bland.  It lacks the depth of a good roguelike, and there are certain things that keep it from having the flow they were looking for.  The crafting system seems big and complicated, but honestly I don't care enough about it to really want to use it.The story mode is pretty boring and honestly not that great from what I've seen so far.  Endless mode is a bit more fun.. but for that, I feel like I have a dozen games that do this type of thing 10x better.Controls/UI:It feels like it was made for consoles/tablets first, and haphazardly ported to PC.  You can't rebind the controls, and if you want to use a controller, you have to go edit filenames to make sure the included controller preset file for your type of controller is named _controls.csv... and you better hope they included a preset for your controller, since there are only like 4 availible.  I'm not kidding.  This is VERY LAZY on the developer's part, and I imagine some users who aren't so great with computers will struggle with this.  In-game menu, please!  Is that so much to ask?The keyboard controls are wiggity-whack.  Why can't ""I"" be inventory?  E for equipment?  Q or L for Questlog? S or K for skills?  You know, like most roguelike/lite games?  You can move with QWEASDZC, the numpad, the mouse, or the left-stick on the controller.  Facing different directions is easy enough on controller, since you just use the right-stick, but to turn with the keyboard you have to hold space and press a direction.  It's very clunky.  I hear an update is coming soon that will allow users to rebind controls... via (you guessed it!) an INI file.  ugh.  Again...  IN. GAME. MENU. PLEASE.The controls are much more bearable with my 360 controller during actual gameplay, but are slow and annoying to use in the inventory menus.The UI is full of big buttons, and menus that pop out of the sides of the screen.  It looks like a tablet game.You have 3 levels of zoom. ""way too close"" ""okay, but I'd like to zoom out maybe just a little"" and ""way too far away""Sound:The sounds and music are pretty good.  Not great, not bad.. just alright.Graphics:Kinda pretty.. pre-rendered 3D-esque sprites.. nice shaders and effects.  It looks pretty nice, though sometimes walls and other objects on the terrain just get in the way of me seeing what I'm doing.  The graphics are one of this game's strongest aspects.. but sometimes the big sprites and terrain objects are just too much.In conclusion... Wait and see if the devs get their act together on the controls... and maybe see if it goes on sale or something.  At this time, I wouldn't recommend it.  Certainly not at full price.			"

												For HC players: I just have died by attempting to eat the shovel. Yes, shovel. I never knew it is possible to kill oneself by trying to eat shovel, but look, apparently it is. However, in a certain way it shows an attitude of the creators toward a game itself - it is too much of a joke.If you like serious HC were your survival depends on tactic, strategy etc. - stay away.

												First impressions is It's a beautiful game with a great soundtrack, but frustrating and just not fun. I'm not going to complain about the common issues. Since everyone else has complained about stuff like the UI and clunkyness and everything, there's no point in doing so. DFS feels like it doesn't know if it wants to be an RPG or a Rogue-like. You save your game in town (and there's a bit of an auto-save feature when you leave town), you level up and get stats and allows you to use items of your level, and you generally do RPG-esk stuff. Then you go and do a quest, which is where the roguelike stuff comes into play. Standard turn-based, map stuff. You do stuff, then the monsters do stuff, whatever. It doesn't seem that terrible on the surface, but it's how these two elements mix together.There's a backstab system, but for a good portion of the monsters, it's hard to determine where the back is (you just have to assume, sometimes). The inability to equip any weapon or time you come across can really mess with you, especially if the item in question would help you not die. Exploring the entire map seems to be a mistake (much like a rogue-like), but if you don't, you'll be underleveled and under-equipped for the next quest (and I haven't found a good way to grind yet). If you die, you are reverted back to your last save, losing everything you had gotten that far (no progress after death, which is very unlike a rogue-like) and you can spend upwards to 20 minutes on these boards, only to screw yourself, die, and then lose everything.I'd like to give this game more time to develope, see if after a few patches some of the issues with it are addressed, but right now I can't recomend the DFS because, currently, it just isn't fun.

												One of the most anticipated games for me, unfortunately ended in failure.I wish I could recommend this game, but alas.Here is overall review:PROS: + Georgeus art and eye-pleasing graphics + Satisfying gameplay (Turn-based combat is well made and feels almost like real-time) + Well made story-line + Colorful world and mobsCONS: - Full of bugs - Crashes every second time on travels - Horrifying UI. Seriously, what were you guys thinking?! It asks me every single time if I'm sure of what I want to do. This makes crafting painful. No support of keyboard what-so-ever - Poorly made character dialogues (aside from Robin) - Sound and BGM are below desired level. Battle sounds are annoying and way too ""blunt"". Little BGM diversity. - ""Read or Die"" manual is a sad attempt in making a tutorial. It's so clear that this is a version meant to be printed and shipped with CD/DVD. If you want to include some wiki/tutorial in game - at least make it easy to navigate.A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs and crashes makes this game nearly unplayable.I can close eyes on most of cons but at least make sure your games works and hire some decent UX designer as Grim Bros certainly lack skills in this area.Unfortunately at this stage I can't recommend this games.If Grim Bros would fix at least first two described problems then I could recommend this game as it certainly feels prominent and potential.I hope for future fixes and updates.

												A very nice and beautiful roguelike.I played Story Mode in Hardcore and, of course, I died while doing the third or fourth dungeon quest. I felt lazy to start the story again so I played Endless instead, which is, I think, how roguelikes should be played. I definitely enjoyed Endless more than the Story mode, maybe because I stupidly dived in to Hardcore very soon.I started playing using a Logitech F310 gamepad but I thought it was clunky as hell. So I tried using the keyboard and it was way better but you have to use the mouse to open the menu by clicking a small icon(which is gonna get fixed in patch 1.02 according to the devs). Using the mouse only is currently the best way to play the game.Overall, the game is solid and I highly recommend this.			"

												I loved this game, besides all the buggs (that are still not ironed out), I thought it had that hardcore vibe that I love from roguelikes.My first playthrough(on hardcore), I've been really really close to dying once early on but besides that everything was going very well. I was cruising through making sure to keep my level and gear up to date because you know.. hardcore.After 7 hours of playing, monster farming, crafting and so on. I noticed I could click a food icon when interacting with a shovel. I clicked it and I insta-died.My point is that this game is not made for people that likes roguelike or hardcore, if you like turnbased cute games go for this. If you want hardcore challenge like I did, stay away this game is rediculously unfair. Its a shame really, with a bit of work on buggs and a more thought out system this game could be amazing also for us hardcore players. Sadly the developers have catered to the casual players on this one.			"

												I was recommended this game by the team who made it.I was pleasantly surprised by the content.At first glance the game looks similar to other Rogue-Like games.But that is where the similarity ends.This game has an extensive and engrossing storyline with fleshed out and relatively reealistic characters with actual dramatic arcs.The animation style is pleasing to the eyes and is rather unique.There is a wealth of variety of different monsters and NPC characters.The combat is somewhat tactics based and has a pretty customizable build system.The story, the writing and especially the humor is where this game truly shines.There are a plethora of pop references, hidden humor and extremely well written scenarios which invoke a rather ""Real World"" feel to it.There's also several activities aside from combat in the game to draw your attention, including apretty fleshed out crafting system.This game manages to pull from many genres but still stands apart form being just another ""Mash-Up"".I have thoroughly enjoyed this game so far and cannot wait to continue playing it.It is fun, unique and over all, enjoyable.

												I backed this game on kickstarter. I have played it 3 times and I want to love it but im not impressed. The game looks amazing but fails to deliver on the actual play style. I love my strategy turn based games, but I cant find the ""fun"" in this. I was excited to see a new take on what turn based could do, but having enemies attack you from outside your visual range and a sloppy control makes it difficult to enjoy. I jumped on board when i read the game would be difficult. but i did not expect that to be because of the poor controls and 4000 trees in my way. I just expected tough enemies and that I would need stratagy to overcome the area. Voice over would do so much to pull you into the story, its difficult to fully enjouy the story when each word is a loud click in your ear. I wish the maps would be cleared up and the non-controler (just keyboard ) controls would be improved.			"

												(Note: I only spent about 3.5 hours in Dragon Fin Soup, before asking for a refund. Sorry Grimm Bros.)First off, I want to explain why I did ask for a refund.The bugs, oh the bugs. I've had to delete my game 4 times over that course of time because of my Story Quest not triggering, or because the dungeon I just finished killing EVERYTHING in, had no Exit Portal. Even saving, going to Title Menu and entering again did not show and Exit Portal which is VERY frustrating.The Combat, while different and innovative it feel so urgent. In cases of multiple enemies on the screen you constant feel that ""Oh s%!#, Oh s%!#, Oh s%!#"" motion because they actually know how to double back and attack you in the back causing critical hits and getting you killed.Because, you will die alot, because it's nearly impossible to get healing beverages early in the game.So I just bashed the game to the ground, what did I like though ?The graphics are pretty great, the sound assets are okay but annoying after just a single hour due to repetition. The music is so short and it's on a loop, after that 1 hour I just muted the game because the looped music was just annoying to me.I just keep going don't I ?Well, my best tip is - Do the research before purchasing Dragon Fin Soup. Watch some reviews on YouTube or your preferred source, get some gameplay videos in as well, I don't think you can get too many spoilers, the maps are randomly generated so every save file is going to be different, however it can be seeded just like The Binding of Isaac.And if you do purchase it, you can still ask for a refund if it wasn't worth it for you.Will I come back if the game gets updates ?Maybe, it depends. I'm the kind of person that doesn't come back to anything if I get dissappointed by it, so I more than likely won't unless Grimm Bros. patch out the bugs.			"

												Was really excited for this game. Backed it on kickstarter.Loaded it up day 1First thing i noticed was the big lack of options to configure the game how id like. 1. 1920x1080 resolution was a pain to enable2. Controls are down right awful. Mouse is way to sensitive and nearly impossible to control, Gamepad on the other hand lacks precision as well and doesnt seem to have the option to do stuff turn based??? (i couldnt figure out how)3. Get MASSIVE screen tearing when i run the game fullscreen (even forcing vsync through the drivers)4. The entire game seems to have this annoying ""fog"" filter taking the would be colorful crisp art and graphics and making them look like you are playing with your screen submerged in a bowl of soup. .. hey.. dragon fin soup?5. Conversation bubbles and alerts often pop up and vanish way too quickly.6. The UI is awful. Not at all intuitive7. YOU CANT CHANGE OPTIONS DURING THE GAME!!!!8. Most video options require you to quit the game entirely and restart. Even just to change the resolution? hello 1993!!!As of right now, im done. Im gonna wait for about 3 or 4 major patches before I try this game again. Its just way too glitchy and unfinished feeling for me to try to fight with the controls, the UI, and the rest of the game system. I recommend you wait as well. If it improves, ill gladly change my review. Ill be grabbing this for free on psplus as well, just to see if this is a PC port fiasco, or it suffers from the same problems.			"

Half of the time you cannot see what you are doing and everything with a timer/countdown looks the same (better hope that was a stun and not a bomb!). Random hangs which end up causing you to restart. Totally random difficulties. I like rogue-likes, yet this makes no sense sometimes. I had to fight a stage 4 times because one random enemy would hit for 300+ and my life is only 240ish. You cannot grind or anything, trust me - I clear everything on any level, and then suddenly there's this spike for a few enemies that you're, in no way, able to handle.Unbalanced, horrible UI (mouse play is atrocious, controller is ok, a bit tedious and you have to remember everything - prompts are only for pc).

												A weird game. Has great art and graphics, lackluster story and characters, and the gameplay is confusing. There's no real options in the game, the menu system is odd, and having what you want happen in the game isn't always an easy thing. It's hard to see anything as there is little transparentcy when you are behind something. Clicking something doesn't always result in you going or attacking what you clicked on.As a kickstarter I had high hopes, and was disappointed. If someone had no experience or knowledge of it, I think the gameplay would be a huge turnoff right away. I'll likely try to get through some more of the game and hope it improves, but I wouldn't recommend it as it is.			"

												SoI amde this awesome +10 Greatsword I'm talking flaming paladin Carsomyr grade action all ready to slot this thing and fight monsters. But all you get is a pathetic sword swipe animation. No appearance changes on gear, weapons, game is grindy as hell with a windows vista style ""DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS"" thing you have to click before crafting the 100 things you need to make more useless♥♥♥♥♥♥then you realize the game has no story, boring non-intuitive combat, and you uninstall. Skip this piece of rogue-not garbage.			"

Product received for free
												Pros: I got the highscore so they gave me a t-shirt, it is an okay t-shirt but it has too much text and I don't like it.It was free.Con:Sometimes it is not free.			"

												Good game, an old bump RPG brought into the modern day. The only really suck part was that the crafting system is way too clunky for the amount you can do with it.Also met the guys at PAX east, they were real♥♥♥♥♥♥bags and wouldn't give me the time of day to ask about their game. They were much more interested in talking to some painted up cosplaying tart.			"

												There are no hotkeys and no way to rebind.  Think esc brings up the options menu?  Nope, have to click on the picture.  This is an extrememly bad tablet port with little to no thought towards civilized PC players.  Until they make this game civilized I cannot recommend it at any price.			"

												Been following since it's KickStarter but didn't fund it, been a minor fan of roguelikes and DFS' art style caught my attention.Currently enjoying it 2 hours in, crude humor is always a plus, i find myself destroying every tree/rock/box in sight, learnt the expensive way not to break peoples things... even trees.For an indie game its very well polished now and very deserving of its 20USD pricetag, good job on releasing a game and sticking with it until the end.Trading Cards Please?(I only want them for wallpapers and emotes)			"

												Imagine you're at a party. In this case a party for top down, tile-based RPGs. You see this kinda weird looking chick, but you get a really stronghearted vibe from her hearing her talk and interact with others. Yeah, you are a creepy stalker in this review, just like all gamers today are when following a game's development, but not as abusive as most of them. And then it's your turn, you see her idle, you walk up to her and try to start an easy conversation. The conversation goes nothing like you imagined, nothing you could've mentally prepared before talking to her would be of any use. She's quirky, a strong woman, but quirky. The first minute basically was letdown to you and you think of just parting ways. But then there's this kinda magical moment that makes you feel like a wuss for already leaving her, so you start playing along with her weird ways. And after a few minutes you get her and you kinda start digging her. Yeah, you'll probably not invite her over right away, but every time you meet her this magical vibe starts getting stronger and stronger. This is the only way i am able to describe my experience with this game on a sentimental level. And if my weird thought experiment would go on it would finish with ""...and then they married and lived happily together ever after."" Alongside the PC and PS4 i also play the PS Vita version a lot, because on the go this is great for short sessions, while PC for me is great to play the story mode on. I wouldn't recommend trying to grind this game for many hours in one go, because it's combat mechanics will eventually get to you in very negative ways, which is the reason for so many negative reviews. The combat mechanics are interesting, maybe even implemented in the best way this basic idea couldve been realized in a game, but still they are very frustrating, making the game unnecessarily hard to master. I'm speaking of everyone only moving when you do - and this in a tile-based system.I love this game as you can guess by all the versions of it i bought for so many platforms, and i'm neither payed nor a backer of the kickstarter. If you love random generated worlds and monster placement, standard top down, tile based RPG mechanics paired with an interesting twist, this game is for you.I'd also recommend checking out ""Little Viking How To Play Dragon Fin Soup"" on YouTube to give you 100% insight on the game's basics.

												Straight from the horse's mouth: Yes, improvement is needed, but most of the problems with the game seem like those that can easilly be fixed with some minor patches. The controlls have a MEDIUM level of learning curve and it can be a little repetitive. That being said, the game is fun to play. I am about 10 hours in and quite enjoy the style, music, and gameplay. Once patched up, I see great potential for this game. As it is now, any minor annoyances are outweighed by the fun factor. This game will only get better with a little bit of time. (Also, if it makes any difference, I am a Kickstarter backer).			"

												An inventive, tongue-in-cheek, diffecult, addictive and so on and so forth RPG. Slight bias since I backed it, but I am not in the least disappointed with this game. It was everything I expected and more. Instantly, the OST and beautifully twisted and unique artwork draws you in. In game, the zoom made it wonderful for somebody with severe visual disabilities like myself. You start playing as Robin, Red Riding Hood all grown up... and pi$$ed... in both senses of the word. Drinking vast amounts of alcohol heals our heroine, with the looming horror of her becoming uncontrollably drunk and comedically psychotic. I cannot rave enough about this. It's what an RPG should be. Beautifully crafted, diffecult, tactical, inventive and thoroughly extensive. Get it. Guarenteed instant addiction and the next ♥♥♥♥ knows how long of your life taken. The 5 person Dev team has done an excellent job (and unlike a lot of politically driven ideologues who like to infect the indie game market with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, these guys actually came through with the kickstarter.) DFS is a title I hope will not only mean a great future for GrimmBros dev team, but revive good RPGs. 5/5			"

												This game is an excellent game to pass the time. The story is not so heavy that it requires a serious investment of several hours in order to get into it, but it is good enough to keep you interested througout its development. Combat is fun and easy, as you have a serious advantage over most enemies--you can move diagonally while they are stuck on the x-y axis. However, if you get yourself backed into a corner, you can get eaten alive easily. Some of the non-story related quests do get a little repetitive, but are generally fun, and easy enough to complete. Overall, this game is a fun, lighthearted game to pass the time.			"

												I Kickstartered this game, and for the time that it worked, despite the rough edges in the first releases, it was fun.Before really digging in, I decided to wait for some of the big patches to come out, but by then I was busy with life and had to put the game on hold.Fast forward, I upgraded to Windows 10, and now the game no longer will start at all. I deleted all the files and re-installed, read forum threads, and tried everyhing recommended. In the end I got nowhere.But here is the kicker: The devs seem to have disappeared off the face of the Earth. No patches in nearly a year, and no word on the upcoming big content update in almost as long.At this point, it certainly looks like abandonware.			"

												Anything written here is a revision of my original review. The original one is at the end of the post. Of note is that anger affected me as I wrote the original one.The developer took some time but eventually got around to replying to my emails and making sure I got my keys. They offered solutions and were open to keep helping if there were any troubles. While it bothers me to have backed the game and gotten my keys a week late, after those who bought it at release or got it for free with PS+,♥♥♥♥♥♥happens and it doesn't seem to me like these issues were a consequence of these guys being lazy and/or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They seem to be a pretty nice bunch of guys/gals from my interactions with them.As for the game itself, they are indeed working on many of the issues. I've read some of the patch notes and it seems they're actually working on improving the PC version, unlike so many developers nowadays who throw out a turd and leave it as is.The art is beautiful and the universe engaging, inspired by stories we all know and love but managing to differentiate itself in an interesting way.As for how the gameplay has improved, I'm really busy so I haven't actually gotten around to testing it with the latest patches. I will however recommend it now for I'm convinced the game will eventually, if not already, be in a decent state.Original review: Backed on kickstarter and never actually got my keys. Didn't even get a reply from the mails I sent them when they were asking people wth the issue to contact them, so be wary of these guys. The UI is also♥♥♥♥♥♥for pc, doesn't work well with mouse and keyboard at all. It's easy to tell they completely focused on consoles and PC was just an afterthought.			"

												Pretty awesome game with cool graphic. I really like games like this. Story or freeplay, RPG with cool characters that you can choose. Many mobs, interesting world and his history. Equipment that you can use, stuff to do like for rogue like game is enough for me.			"

												Whoa, this was a pleasant surprise.  I slog through a lot of terrible rougelikes, and this one was pretty much exactly what I wanted so far.  Very reminiscent if Chunsoft's earlier work (chocobo's mysterious dungeon, shiren the wanderer), but much deeper.  I haven't even fleshed out the game mechanics, but I can tell you that I already like it better than FF chronicles.  There are some downsides, the loading screens are ridiculous for what loads, and there is a loading screen every time you enter any building. The devs did a really great job.			"

												I read the bad reviews and thought avoid. Then I read the good reviews that it was all fixed. So I thought I'd give it a chance.I wanted to like it, I mean it's name Dragon Fin Soup reminds me of playing stone soup. One of the best roguelikes ever.However this game is everything SS wasn't. It has fancy graphics that glitch out and give you eye strain. It has music, unfortunately the same 4 bars on loop but hey.. But most depressingly it has boring monsters and war of attristion combat.I wanted to like it, but I dont			"
