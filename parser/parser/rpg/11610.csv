												DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM.  IF YOU DECIDE TO GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY (and I wouldnt advise it.) ONLY USE PREPAID CARDS.The reason for this is if you pay anyway other than prepaid you will get NX credit instead of NX prepaid. Why does it matter? Because you cant buy anything with NX credit (well nothing you would ever want to buy at least).  No you will not get a refund and no there is no way to transfer the NX you bought into a useable form. Please either upvote this review or put an advisory about this in your own review so that people are aware of this when decideing if and how they want to spend money on this game.Thanks			"

												If you're looking for a really fast action MMO, then this is the game for you. It starts off a bit slow but once you select your first class specialization(ie. Warrior-->Barbarian, Mage-->Fire Mage) the game becomes much more intense. The combat is easily the highlight of this game; the feeling of decimating a battlefield with 30 enemies on screen with a giant AoE attack is great! I only feel the character customization is lacking... Options for hair and faces feel limited and classes are gender-locked, so if you want to play as a male Archer, you're outta luck. Overall it's a pretty solid MMO with plenty of dungeons to try your hand at.4/5			"

												Overall a very fun game. However playing solo can be quite boring sometimes so it's best if you get someone to join with you.As with all games there are pros and cons, the most annoying cons I have found are the gender locked classes, and that certain cash items have to be bought with NX Prepaid (using cards etc.) not with NX Credit (using your credit/debit card and steam cash). Other than that the game is quite enjoyable, and isn't entirely a p2w game like most so called f2p games are.As for PVP, pretty much anyone stands a chance at being good no matter what character they have, it all comes down to skill. Though according to various forums some classes are better than others, but I disagree as I have watched so called OP classes get absolutely destroyed by the so called lower PVP classes.The quests and levelling system can be quite grindy and repetitive at times, but if you're with a friend you dont really mind quite as much since you clear the dungeons quite quickly, most of the time in under 5mins.I highly recommend this game for anyone to try. I was quite sceptical to begin with but have quickly become addicted to playing.			"

												[Note: this review was so long, it had to be continued in comments - see first reply by me for part 2. Also note that this is not your traditional dot point pro/con 5 second review. This is an editorial piece telling the story of how I fell in love with this amazing game.]Although I like to consider myself a true gamer-girl through and through, I have to admit that there was one single genre I'd never tried - an MMO. The whole ""pay to play"" thing was a huge hurdle for me when I was a child, and so despite my fascination with the idea of such a large, virtual community, everquest and the like were always out of reach. Fast-forward a decade and times have unsurprisingly changed. With nearly all MMO games becoming free to play, I finally had a chance to try out this genre that had piqued my interest for oh so many years. So around December 2012, I bit the bullet and started trawling through free-to-play MMO's, to see what all the fuss was about. And I have to admit, my first choices did not live up to my expectations. I tried games like Mabinogi and Rose online, but the combat just felt totally clunky and painful. There was little in the way of moving and dodging, with most of the focus simply being on casting skills with incredibly long cast times, and even longer cooldowns. Or alternatively,  just whacking something with a stick over and over ad nauseum, before it keeled over and died. The graphics were bland, the enemies were repetitive, and the story seemed non-existant.  I was beginning to think that I'd been seriously mislead about the nature of MMO's, and that they were all essentially just fancy IRC rooms.But then I installed a lil game called Dragon Nest. Like my previous choices, I spent a large amount of time tinkering around in the character creator, eventually choosing a class called - wait for it - tinkerer. This is a cute little girl of about 13, who, when given the twin pigtail hairstyle, beared more than a striking resemblence to me at that age. The similarities were quite uncanny, which immediately grabbed my attention. Instead of roleplaying, I was simply getting to relive my youthful days as a young teen - something which meant a lot to me, being in my late 20's and utterly depressed at the fact that I'm not far off my thirties. But the other games had nice character creations too, only to be let down by the game itself. So I wasn't all that optimistic about this game either. My pessimism was shattered the instant I entered the game world. After a short introduction scene, I found myself in a beautiful snowy town, decorated with x-mas items and a nice big christmas tree at the centre of town, along with some really cheery christmas-y music. Not only this, but I saw many other characters running around - lil tinkerers like myself, sorcerers, and some rather charming looking clerics. The whole place was very pleasant and inviting, and I really felt a warm welcome to the game and the community as a whole.As I ambled around the town, obtaining main story quests as well as side quests, I noticed that the story behind this game was very well executed, with lots of voice acting on all the main NPC's - a welcome change from static walls of text from mute characters that I'd encountered in nearly all my previous MMO games up to this point. I was also approached by a polite warrior gentlemen, whom, upon noting my newbie status, kindly started explaining many of the concepts of the game to me. He also invited me into his guild, which I was somewhat hesitant about as I didn't feel I would be of any use as a newbie. He assured me it was fine, and that anyone was welcome. I'm glad I accepted the offer because I went on to meet many wonderful people, who taught me a great deal about the game and were more than willing to help me complete tasks on many occasions. Initially however, I chose to complete the dungeons solo, just to get a feel for the combat in this game. This isn't really an open world MMO, you simply have a town with many quests available, and then you have a closed instance field outside of the town for you (and any party members), with several dungeons being accessible from that field. This makes the game suitable for a wide audience, without needing too powerful of a computer (although don't get me wrong, the graphics are very pleasant too!). Upon entering my first dungeon was my next pleasant surprise. The combat in this game is amazing! It was how I'd imagined all MMO's would play, prior to actually playing them. I've been told this style is called an action MMO, and it plays somewhat like a first person shooter / third person shooter, with a huge emphasis on reaction times, dodging, combo'ing, as well as carefully choosing the most ideal order in which to carry out attacks. It's very frantic, but also very rewarding. It's easy to pick up, but very hard to master. Having tried other apparent action MMO's, I have to say that Dragon Nest hands down has the best combat I've ever experienced - it's THAT satisfying. I continued playing through about the first ten levels, but I was alone and in truth the game didn't feel that much different to single player RPG's that I'd played. This all changed when, upon my next visit to town, I was invited to my first party. I think this was the point where the game stole my heart, and I knew that I was going to be playing this for a long time. In fact, I ended up playing for 24 hours straight that very day, it was *that* endearing to me. The game promotes teamwork heavily, with many abilities to help each other out in the form of buffs, debuffs, heals and the like. Not only this, but it was just simply fun to feel a part of something so grand. Even just chatting in town (which we ended up doing for hours) was immensely satisfying, and I met over 30 friends in that first day alone. From this point on, the game consumed me - I played it all day, everyday, whenever I had the free time to do so.  I was really eager to see what would happen next in the main story, while at the same time being happy to party with those of similar level (or even help those at lower level catch up to me). Before I knew it, my friends list was maxed out at 100. I had to tell people to add me and just send me a message whenever they wanted to party, as I had no room left on my list. Such friendships made me feel really happy - something that had been sorely lacking in my real life ever since an incident that left me scarred with PTSD, during which some brutish man tried to kill me (literally) over a road rage incident. He very nearly succeeded too, as he pushed my car towards a tree at 100 miles an hour, which I missed by mere inches. But I digress, this review is about the game not my own injustices.  I merely wished to portray that my friends here really helped me come a long way to recovering from this incident. So back to the game now - at this point I was steadily getting through quests and making my way towards the level cap. So now is probably a good time to talk about the ""pay"" features that you have in any free to play MMO. Dragon Nest adheres to the policy of paid items being primarily cosmetic in function - this is not a ""pay 2 win"" game, and there are many well known players who have not paid anything for the game at all, whom are still some of the most powerful and well-geared characters on the server. Of the few items that *do* help make a character more powerful (namely jellies for enhancing items, and stamps for allowing to sell certain high grade items on the market) both of these may be purchased from other players with in-game gold, negating the need to spend real world cash. [Part 2 of review continued in comments to this due to length restrictions. Please don't leave your own comments guys, it will ruin the order of my replies]			"

												For some clarification: I have played this game since Open Beta around September 2011, long before it was released on Steam so I'd average around maybe 5,000 hours give or take a thousand.This game used to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. The combat is phenomenol, still kind of is. The story is gripping although a little trope-y. Most if not all of the classes are unique in their own way, each having their own playstyle. Now why would I not recommend this game despite all the good things, it's only because the cons heavily outweigh the pros.Let's start with content. Content is one of the biggest concerns I have had with this game for a while. The level caps have increased from 16, 24, 32, 40, 50 etc., with each cap including a couple of small 'nests' which are more or less instances with 4-5 bosses with some mechanics built in, a raid which is essentially like the nests only with 8 people instead of 4 and then the hell raid which adds a couple mechanics and makes everything stronger. Each cap lasts about 5-8 months with the exception of 40 cap which lasted nearly a year and some odd months. These months are filled with grinding the same dungeons and 'nests' week to week to try to get the best gear.Now we'll talk about gear. Gear follows a familiar rarity system, Normal, Magic, Rare, Epic, Unique, and Legendary. Normal to Rare is highly disregarded when playing Dragon Nest, if you're seen wearing them you'll be kicked from a party without hesitation, but we'll get into community in a bit. Epic gear is obtained from doing the nests over and over again for materials to craft. There's usually 2 different Epic sets for each cap, one being for magic-based classes, the other being for physical based classes. Unique gear is obtained from completing the normal raid and getting it dropped randomly. Legendary gear is recieved from drops in the hell version of a raid. Essentially to get the best gear in the game you essentially have to just have immense luck, and not to mention a team which can actually clear a raid consistently. Gear does not change any part of attire except for your weapons, so if you're looking to be a fashionista without forking over some cash you're out of luck. When it comes to making your character not look like the average joe, you'll usually have to pay 15-30 dollars on a costume. A lot of the time you won't be able to mix-and-match costumes to get the ""ultimate"" look just based on the fact that you'll lose a set bonus. These set bonuses get better the more you pay up, and if you ever do feel the need to mix-and-match you'll have to get lucky buying gachapon and getting the single item that allows you to do so, did I mention you need one for each piece of equipment you wish to alter? That's not all, if you're looking to get the highest rarity costumes you'll need to fork over even more cash to get sets and fuse those set pieces together for a CHANCE at a higher rarity costume piece. Good luck!Class balancing is another of the bigger concerns with the game. Every so often there's a balancing patch, when this patch comes around there will ALWAYS be that one class that excells over all the others. This a lot of the time leads to people completely shunning other classes based on their tier list. And when it comes to nerfing a class, the nerf will just be making another class significantly more powerful than the other. If you're thinking about exclusively playing one class and still being able to join up with others then I'm sorry to say that's not the case. Let's get to talking about the community. It's a fairly small game so the community is kind of scrunched up. A lot of the people are generally really nice, but when it comes to actually playing the game, personalities may be a bit skewed. A fair bit of players, especially the people who have been around for a long while, which make up a fair portion of the game, are elitist in one way or another. There is a list of requirements for joining parties ranging from having proper gear, the highest enchantments, the best gems, etc. It doesn't matter if you're trying to learn how to do the latest nest or something to that extent, you will be kicked on the spot if the party leader is not appeased by your gear. This game is without a doubt not friendly to new players, I hate to say.PVP is one of the few things this game has left to offer, and even in that case PVP has had an incessive lag since the game was released till now.I could keep going on and on about all the problems with the game, but I feel I've covered the bare essentials. A couple years ago I would've recommended this game, but unfortunately it just fell into the usual Korean MMO loop of unfortunate cases.			"

												Note: This review is a bit outdated (It was made at around 70 cap). Some of my complaints might have been addressed at this point but I have not played the game recently so I cannot tell for myself. Fundamentally this review is still accurate though.My steam time for this game is not accurate. I likely have at the very minimum 1,500~ hours in game.tl;dr: Gameplay is solid and suprisingly good with a reasonable amount of depth. However, the grind from lowest level to max level (even with someone grinding you) can be nigh unbearable. The games optimization is hit-or-miss with many players computers as the optimization seems to be based on CPU power with it hardly if at all utilizing the GPU. In terms of class-to-class balance, the actual devs are fairly incompetent at making sure one class doesn't completely dominate the others.In depthGameplay:The gameplay of Dragon-nest is primarily fast-paced combat with heavy reliance on reflexes, ability to predict the enemy movements, and knowing your own skills. The combat has no casting bars rather relying on animations which makes you feel as though you are 'in control'. Many of the higher level skills do a satisfying amount of damage in PvE and a reasonable amount in PvP. In my experience, the end-game content (Dragon nests) often devolve DPS races to blow up the boss before it has a chance to do any of it's harder mechanics. Simply getting hit by some of these bosses could result in an instant death for you. Note: In the end-game content, after you die, you are dead until the raid (called 'nest' ingame) is complete or your entire party dies.PVP:PVP deserves it's own section because for many players it is simply all that matters in the game. PVP is largely player-skill based as a highly skilled player can easily combo the other player to death, giving the other player no opportunities to fight back. There are a few types of PVP in Dragon Nest which I will describe quite simply. There is Ladder, Endless, 1v1, and blacklisted 1v1.Ladder is what many players might call 'competitive' mode with a rating, but in reality, it is simply an infestation of a single class. Gear plays a role in this mode and for many PVP'ers, no one actually cares about it, since gauging it as a metric of skill is completely stupid.Endless is simply 8v8 combat. Given its playercount, it is easily the laggiest mode for many players and, simply put, is a mind-less cesspool of high AOE skill-spamming. Gear does not matter.1v1 is what it is. Gear does not matter.Blacklisted 1v1 is different from what you might expect it to be. To give it a bit of a background, many players view some skills as overpowered compared to other skills (example: A mercenary's 'Iron Skin'). Most classes have a few of these skills and players will mutally agree to not use these skills. For some players, Blacklisted 1v1 might include entire classes or very specific rulesets and for many players, what is blacklisted to someone might not be blacklisted to the other. Most 'legitimate PVP'ers' play this.One other 'important' aspect about PVP is PVP rank. PVP rank is arguably important because there is an icon associated with your rank. Initially, it is a brown egg icon next to your name. As you PVP more, you get more experience and the icon changes. The other icons are blue (silver) and yellow (gold). However, be warned, the blue and yellow icons are EXTREMELY difficult to attain as they are exclusive to a certain rising XP threshold. It is difficult to describe in words but simply put, if you were to attempt to become the player with the #1 amount of experience, it would easily take you a year of pvp'ing to get even close to it.Sound:The sounds of Dragon Nest are fairly average I would personally say, although, one of the key issues many players seem to have is that the voice-actors for some of the classes are borderline cringeworthy, prompting some users to completely disable the voice or download a foriegn language voice mod. Another one of the issues and to many players and advantage is that most if not all the skills have their own special voice-line for casting that spell. This means when your Adept (that's a class) casts Inject, every single time you are going to hear what sounds like a child say, ""This might sting a bit!"" Graphics:The graphics are good and fantastic for many of the skills. However, some classes and raids (nests) in particular have crippling effects on many player's computers. One class in particular, the Alchemist, has a few spells that are strong in PvP simply because for many players, casting it is 'like opening six movies at the exact same time', resulting in a crippling half-second burst of lag.Community:The community of Dragon Nest is fairly odd. A mix of Anime fanatics and normal people coupled with a loud creepy population. The population seems to be a mix of 12 to 19 year olds with some guilds greatly skewing this margin. I highly recommend finding a guild that suits your playstyle rather than joining one of the ones that you get invited to right off the bat. The best way to do that is make a friend in-game and try their guild. Server & Game Issues:The server occasionally seems to have frustrating issues with lag. Sometimes these issues are extremely frustrating as they might completely void and entire 'nest', leading to a player missing out on loot. One of the most notable issues is the completely unavoidable 'Hackshield', and instant kick from the game resulting in the failure of the games anti-cheat. It is not detecting a false-positive, merely it just messes up.Pay-to-win Factor:Suprisingly, this game isn't nearly as pay to win as I expected. The only pay-2-win'ish factor seems to be Dragon eggs and, even then, the only good thing that comes from them is wings which boost your characters movement speed in everything but PVP. When it comes to costumes, 'green' costumes boost stats which can pretty much only be purchased through NX (real life money). However, 'blue' costumes which boost stats much greater than 'green' costumes can only be reliably purchased through large amounts of ingame gold.Overall: The game is suprisingly good but has a good few problems that detract from some of the good parts. The game seems to have a large issue when it comes to grinding of either money or levels. There are minor issues with the community regarding it's vocal immature side.			"

												[EDIT: Dragon Nest is not associated with Nexon anymore. Although this review is outdated, the leveling guide is still updated. Please take a look at that.]*A LENGTHY REVIEW*Background Information:Dragon Nest is a free-to-play fantasy MMORPG published by Nexon NA (Steam Version). Play Style/Game PlayIt uses a non-targeting combat system (which most MMORPG have), so basically you have full control of the players movement using the keys ""W, A, S, D"". You are able to use your skills using the short cut keys ""1-10"" or change your key bindings to see which better suits you. Dragon nest consists of 2 game modes or 2 of both, PvP and PvE. You start off as PvE but later through the levels you can change to PvP or do both. The game consists of 8 Characters of which they have their own unique skills and abilities. ClassesClasses have 'specialisations' where they can change into their first and second job and focus on that particular area of combat. Specialisations are granted at level 15 and level 44. The 8 classes include: Warrior Archer Cleric Sorceress  Tinkerer Kali Assassin LanceaFor more information of the classes and what specialisations they have go to the Nexon website @ http://dragonnest.nexon.net/guides/class-guideLike every game they have their pros and their cons. Here are mine:Pros:+Gameplay system. The choice of movement and mechanics are great+Community. Everyone is nice but you do get the occasional person that isn't so nice+Exp rate. There are so many opportunities you get with bonus exp to level up your character as fast as possible+Simple. Easy to learn but takes practice to learn the mechanics of the characters. Practice makes perfectCons:-The lack of designing your character. The class you choose has already determined of what type and style you are. You don't really have that much of a choice to change your personal features, and the gender has been set to that class.-Repetitive. The game can get a little repetitive at times, doing the same dungeons over and over again. But it isn't really that much of a bother if you have a friend to play with youOverallI've played Dragon Nest when it was in Beta, but I've kept quitting and coming back 3 times. I've finally stuck with the game. Leveling can be hard at times and you have no choice but to the grind to get to the level you desire, but that's with most MMORPGs. When I reached the level cap, I thought it was worth all the hard times of grinding. You'll think that reaching the max level will be the end, but it's a whole new chapter and there are far more things to do and goals to be set.Here's my friend's guide for leveling:

												Hi everyone, this is honestly more personal than anyting but I want someone to hear me out and maybe find someone who can relate to me.I reviewed this game a few years back in 2013, and recommended it but now that has changed. Dragon Nest now is not the same game compared to the launch date 2010-2015. Let me list my basic points.- Difficulty of the game• Removal of difficulty modes such as Hard, Master, Abyss in multiple dungeons• Monsters and Bosses dying upon one hit• The ability to level up quickly and surpass the area/nest/quest, essentially posing no challenge for players- Nests• The removal of nest such as the Level 32 Cerebus Nest or Level 40 Apocalyse Nest- Removal of Items• Due to the removal of nest, players can no longer find or craft armor exclusive to the nest for their level,items include: Elf Queen set or Cerebus set • Generic and general armor pieces with the rarity of Rare and Epic, the lack of oppertunity to enchance armor found unless it is of the Epic rarityIn conclusion the game was reworked where it was no longer about the journey, but the ending. This is not how any MMORPG should function. What lead to these changes and why? Dragon Nest has, been, is and remain my favorite MMORPG, no other game will beat the charm this game had and the memories I had created. It is extremely sad and disappointing to see what has happened to it in just 2 years. This game got me into gaming, and kept me in gaming but now I can only reflect on what the game was but no longer have the ability to replay and relive those moments again.Thank you for reading, I wish this for this to reach out to the game makers/company/publisher or anyone who will just hear me out as someone who has been apart of Dragon Nest since 2011.

What is this gameDragon Nest is a Free to Play MMO Action RPG with an anime-like art style. This game features fast paced combat, skill shot/aiming mechanics and 8 different classes. Unlike WoW or many other MMOs, the game isn’t open world, and most of everything is instance based.ClassesAssassin: Deadly martial artist that deals burst dmg. Builds Str and Agi. Shinobi: Focuses more on dealing phys dmg. Taoist: Focuses more on supporting allies with Light and Dark powersKali: Spiritual dancer that debuffs enemies and supports allies. Builds Str and Int. Dancer: Focuses more on dealing damage. Screamer: Focuses more on debuffing and buffing.Sorceress: Female mage class that deals magic damage (Duh). Builds Int. Mystic: Focuses more on Dark and Light spells/dmg. Elementalist: Focuses more on Ice and Fire spells/dmg.Warrior: Melee sword fighter. Builds Str and Vit. Swordsman: Focuses on slash attacks. Mercenary: Focuses on knocking down enemies.Archer: Elf ranged bow class that focuses on dps (Duh). Builds Agi. Sharpshooter: Focuses on single target dps. Acrobat: Focuses on aerial combat.Cleric: Holy magic class that buffs allies and heals them. Builds Str and Vit. Paladin: Focuses on tanking up allies Priest: Focuses on healing allies.Tinkerer/Academic: Jack of all trades class. Builds Agi and Int. Engineer: Focuses on doing physical damage with robots and guns. Alchemist: Focuses on doing magical debuffs and supporting allies.Lencea: Spear/lance user thats not in the NA version as of the beginning of January 2015. Builds Str and Int.Why did I start playingA friend suggested that I and another friend should try this game out since he previously played it back in 2012. So I installed it, thinking it would one of those F2P games that I would play for 20 hours and stop playing. My friend had a Sorceress from before and my other friend made a Tinkerer, so I decided to make an Assassin. I specialized him to Taoist, leveled him to 20, and got bored with him. I saw that the Tinkerer can summon a giant robot and hit things with a giant wrench, which reminded me of Max from Dark Cloud 2, so I made one. When I got to choose a Job Specialization, my friend had previously made his an Engineer, so I made mine an Alchemist. This is when I really dove into the game, finding out that most of the Alchemist’s abilities are really fun to use. At level 45, I got to choose a second job specialization; the Adept’s increased Fire and Ice power or the Physician’s increased Poison and Healing power. I chose Physician because I like playing healers. Now I have 350+ hours in the game and probably not stopping soon. Why do I like this gameI like it mainly because it’s an action RPG with fast-paced fighting and I love action RPGs. This game is not a freemium at all and very little pay to win(costume items give very little stats, and you can buy item protection jellies and revives with real money).Why should/shouldn’t you play itWhile the gameplay is fun, I have many problems with it. Bandwagoning: Raid parties tend to favor certain classes/specs over others and instantly kick the ones that are not meta. My main class, Physician is one of those non-meta classes and I have trouble finding parties since people favor Light Bringers over Priests and Physicians. This is due to the whole “Light Party” meta that is pretty much centered around Light Bringers, Crusaders/Inquisitors and Light converted DPS classes.Bad model textures: The textures in my opinion are low quality and unappealing.Annoying voices: 80% characters in the game have very cheesy lines.The Tinkerer is a 11 year old girl: The Tinkerer is commonly referred as the “Loli Class,” and the fact that I main one makes me feel like a pedo. I just like their skillset that’s all. There many reasons why I feel people don’t play this game. First is the anime-esque art style, since a lot people dislike anime. Second is that the graphics’ quality is bad. Third is the niche community of mostly otakus and weeaboos. Overall what do thinkI really enjoy this game. I find the gameplay fun and interesting with a high amount of replay value. I would suggest people to at least try it out to see if you like it or not. This is a good game to delve into if you are bored, so I pretty much recommend this for people to play.			"

												There's something about Dragon Nest that sets it apart from Nexon's other major action-MMO title Vindictus. It certainly has the anime style charm to it and tons of humor behind many of its characters and quests. but I feel its easier to immerse myself into the game as a whole. The combat is fun and the while the classes are genderlocked you don't really mind that fact once you start playing. I will always come back to this game when I want my fill of hack and slash adventure!			"

												The graphics are adorable. The dialog of your character and the NPCs is hilarious. There are plenty of powerful and dazzling skills to spam. There are a huge number of quests to complete. You can journey through the game solo or with friends - I REALLY like games that give you both options. All in all, this is a very fun MMORPG that does a good job of combining pure action and RPG elements. It may take a bit of practice at first to get the hang of it but give it a chance and you won't regret it.			"

												Dragon Nest is an instance-based action RPG playing much like an arcade game with no targeting, a strict class tree, a less strict skill tree, and more or less no character customization whatsoever. For instance, all Tinkerers are time-travelers who somehow turned into adorable lolitas, and all Kalis are abundantly female spirit dancers with sweet, slightly shy temperaments and dead masters.Masters in their tribal ninja teachings, not BDSM masters. Moving along.Dragon Nest's English localization is -incredibly- well-done, with dialogue that is not only legible but actually full of character and humor. The voice acting is goofy, but in a way that lines up with the character in question. The child king is nasally and distinctly lacking a courtly presence, while the storage NPC constantly complains about the horrible things other people / you leave in storage. The marketplace NPC will insult you for being poor (regardless of how much money you are holding because he's so damn rich.)Dungeons have multiple difficulty settings, and the baddest ♥♥♥ dungeons are the titular Nests (though not necessarily dragon nests.) Abyss is the fourth and highest difficulty of any other dungeon, but it is the first difficulty of a Nest, and most of them have a Hell or Hardcore one that's much much harder than that. Nests are effectively your chokepoints for progress through the game, and at any given time one or more Nests will be the ""endgame"" dungeon. The catch is, you can only /win/ one given Nest a limited number of times every week. You can fail as many times as you want, but the great majority of items from Nests are only acquired after a successful clear.Sadly, despite its charms, some significant flaws mar Dragon Nest and detract largely from its otherwise polished gameplay:- As said before, character customization barely exists and development is largely one-way-only - there isn't as freeform choice in character build as there would be in a standard MMO like WoW or Everquest II. It's basically an online arcade game.- It is possible to miss content. This is usually something trivial such as a non-title achievement, but it will still drive completionists up the wall.- The game is entirely instance dungeon-based with little to no open world. The exploration fields don't have any combat in them, nor any content other than NPC's to talk to and gates into instance dungeons (similarly to Sonic Adventure.) This can make the game feel very railroaded and monotonous.- Costume items, which are largely cash-only and non-tradeable, also give you stats and perks. This means they're not costumes. They're cash-only equipment.- Titles also give you stats, but the majority of those are acquired ordinarily ingame and you may use a display title different from your stat title.- As with most if not all other free games that have equipment upgrades available, Dragon Nest's equipment upgrade rate is abysmal without paying cash to improve it and/or protect items from destruction. These items thankfully can be traded, but as cash items they will cost a small fortune.- Holiday events, and events in general, almost never give anything permanent and unique. They give consumables and temporary costumes at best, or items that can be obtained in normal gameplay. They're generally quite underwhelming and unrewarding.- The keyboard control scheme is VERY awkward and can't be remapped.- If you like endowed girls at all you won't be able to play as Kali, because she's constant softcore pornography on the screen and very distracting. She's the only character with jiggle (Archer / Sorceress / Tinkerer are all B-cup or less whereas she's at least a D-cup with a huge butt) and her dance animations border on profane. This is especially jarring given her dialogue is written as though she is very sweet and innocent.Despite these flaws, the game is colorful and fun with only a couple friends. You can form guilds, but only four-odd of you can run a dungeon at once anyway, so you don't need to bring a legion.And Tinkerer is SUPER CUTE. Give it a shot and see if you like it.			"

												I was looking for a new MMO that had fun and challenging PvP and most of all, a story to really IMMERSE myself in. That is what gets me hooked on a game. I made the awful mistake of summing up this MMO with many J/KRPGs out there. I think most of these have very cliched story lines or have poorly written scripts. But Dragon Nest is not the case. If you're a fan of reading quests and PVP, this is definitely a game to try.The story begins differently for each and every class you choose. Granted, they fit into the typical anime character archtypes, the boy who never gives up, the mysterious and talented but silent hero. However, their stories are interwoven in such a way that the characters interact somewhat differently with the NPC dialogues, making it interesting for different perspectives on the main story quest line.As for the state of the game, the devs and GMs seem to pay attention and have interest in retaining their population as well. Spontaneous events occur that you simply click on and teleport to an instance for all sorts of strange games, some familiar and fun with great rewards at the end. The community seems to be tight knit, and the servers swell every time a new content pack is released, and then over the course of two months, dwindles back to a steady population. This is common and expected for most ""themepark"" type MMOs such as WoW as opposed to ""sandbox"" types like EVE online.The gameplay is very fluid, and each class has a large array of flashy skills that make watching their animations very enjoyable every single time. Learning combinations and stacking them is highly addicting. The only thing that feels a bit weird is jumping, there is a very slight pause before taking off from the ground, but this is probably intended this way for fairness in PVP. In a game like Dragon Nest, bunny hopping could be an issue especially with melee classes. MODS! There are mods for this game from intricate skins to voice packs. In most youtube videos, you often hear the characters in the Korean / Japanese voice overs. Admittedly, I installed a Japanese voice pack and mixed it up with Korean as well. I understand neither of the language. But the game sounds MUCH better. The dialogue and the quests are completely in English. Even the cutscenes will not be a problem as they are completely captioned. It gives a more arcade feel to the game.Overall, Dragon Nest is a game that is definitely worth playing and worth recommending. Given Nexons track record on their game development, I feel that Dragon Nest is one of their better games and I hope the community grows and Nexon continues to support Dragon Nest. With its addition to steam, a steady influx of new players decide to give this game a try. It's very newb friendly if this is a beginning MMO for you, and free to play. Give Dragon Nest a shot!			"

												Any good in Dragon Nest is thoroughly ruined by it being a Nexon game, as usual.  The combo-based action combat is promising, but it quickly becomes the typical Nexon grind that pushes you toward overpriced microtransactions before you realize the game is actually just a husk with but a handful of repetitive content.

LIKE WTF DEVS!!! seriously, even REMOVED abyss difficulty for dungeons??? why? that's the ONE other thing about the game that made it FUN. it's apparent why nexon stoped supporting the game cause litteraly 75% of the best content was removed from the game. there is nothing fun about this game anymore. just a complete waste of time. if anyone devs out there give a .... . at the current state, i do NOT RECOMMEND this game.

												   Finding a random party can be kinda hard so it is recommended to play with friends. However with different starting points for every class trying to play as different classes with your friends can become an issue but you will find yourself back with your buddy in a while.     The classes are genderlocked so if you want to play as a archer or a magic caster you will have to play as a girl or if you want to play as the cleric or sword-wielder you will have to play as a guy. (Most people including myself don't see this as a huge issue but is worth mentioning.) Classes do have multiple paths depending on your playstyle.    So far the levels/dungeons feel easy even on the highest difficulty with little penalty for dieing. (however I haven't played in a while so I could be wrong or updates could have changed things.)    Despite these flaws the game is fun and is worth trying with your buddies ( It's free it's not as if you're going to lose anything besides sleep trying it out.) "

												It shatters my heart to write a negative review for Dragon Nest. I only have 60.4 hours on steam but I played Dragon Nest before it was on Steam for 1000+ hours. When I started playing, the level cap was 40 and there was only 4 classes. I was never particulary ""good"" at the game as I only made it to level cap once when the cap was 40. However, 3-4 years ago, this game was just a ♥♥♥♥ing blast. You could play on Abyss difficulty which made the endless grind feel more like a challenging but rewarding adventure. I was never a succesful player but I remember getting so excited over new gear I saved up for a long time by getting Goddess Tear Drops. But now with the level 93 cap, this game is just dead. The added classes are honestly incredible and really diversifies gameplay. The problem is the 1-93 grind is so painfully boring due to limitations on what difficulty you can play. If that wasn't enough, you'll have a hard time trying to find people to play with. It's really a shame because when the game was active, the mentor system worked so well in trying to help your friends get to your rank and really gave an incentive for playing with other people of all ranks. The Goddess Tear Drops and mentor system all still exist which is great. It's just the fundamental aspects of an MMO are compltely and utterly GONE. The market is dead. I mention this because the marketplace used to be PACKED by dozens of people on every server when this game was alive and well. The combat, which is so incredible it kept this game alive far past the time it probably should have actually died; has been made more boring as dungeons have suddenly gotten ridicously easy. I am begging, and I mean BEGGING for Dragon Nest to be shut down in favor of a Dragon Nest 2 with updated graphics, balances, a sensible level cap between 40-93, and less pay-to-win schemes. The arcade-like feel of Dragon Nest makes it unique compared to other MMOs even after so many years that have seen bold competitors enter the MMO market. If they brought Dragon Nest to the next generation with a second installment, everyday gamers would fall head over heals for it. But for now, please don't support the current version.			"

												It hits a certain nostalgic note that made Ragnarok, Legend of Mana, and other past RPG's I've played enjoyable; then adds something special with some Vindictus tied in. It's nothing that will have me playing for days on end due to addiction like I've had in other games, but this game has a lot of charm and makes me feel warm and fuzzy when I play it! It's an awesome casual MMO experience that I highly recommend to anyone looking to try out something different from what they've played before.

												Edit: It seems the developers of this game have really sped up the update pace, which is good and slightly alleviates some of the issues.While it's combat is great and it sure did have a lot of potential as a game and is even actually enjoyable when things are fresh, it's not something I'd recommend playing in the long run if you're looking for something to invest a decent amount of time into. This is due to quite a few reasons, the combat is great and there was/is potential but the game has fell short in literally anything that isn't combat since release and continues to do so with no signs and a incredibly small chance of ever being fixed.Lets start off with a few issues-Lag is common-PvP is not balanced and never will be most likely-PvE is not balanced and never will be most likely-New classes always eclipse previous ones and are overpowered in one way or another in order to promote new characters and purchases of costumes and other things for these new characters (A trend common in F2P titles). The community also supports this (Goes along with it IE: Bandwagonning,etc) and will not allow you to join parties if you're playing a class that isn't as good as some of the others sometimes.-RNG is HUGE in this game and very good at screwing you over with it (Probably in part to get you to pay for items you need to safely enhance gear instead of investing large amounts of time in getting gold just to try again)-Sub classes of each main class usually change from which one is best to again, promote buying class change scrolls and what not for money.-The graphics are worse than something from 2005 and the game is not optimized at all or something is totally broken. Even with current hardware don't expect 60 fps, it's always been like this.-A lot of the really nice purchasable things like mounts, wings, weapon skins and other things are only obtainable by dragon eggs. It's like a gachapon/lottery with a really small chance to get the items that are actually worth anything, usually you just get junk. Eggs aren't cheap either, $1.50 per single Egg and $30 for a 30 pack. You might not even get one of the good things you hoped for by spending that much either, there's people who pay hundreds to get certain items.Now none of this is the main issue with this game nor are these all the issues. I'd say the main problem with this game is the roots of it, the way the game is designed. The game is instanced based with town world hubs. You have dungeons with monsters and a boss at the end and nests/raids which you can do a certain amount of times a week. -Dungeons are useful for leveling up till cap. -Nests are useful for getting drops towards crafting gear and other things. -Raids are for end game gear, there's also a hardcore version. -Dailies can be done once you reach cap, dailies consist of doing the current cap dungeons in order to get certain items that are useful. So here's the deal, level caps come with 1) Filler content (Constant class rebalancing and fixes that never actually fix anything and just shift power for money) 2) A new set of dungeons3) New nests and raid for each cap4) A new classYou'll get one good update every 1~3months with others being nothing special (Subject to change of course, I no longer keep up with the update pace/quality as of recently)So.. here we go, you put so much effort and time into content which is not fun for more than a week at most in order to be able to be strong enough to enjoy the new good content that comes out every 1~3months. This content is usually fun for a week at most (Excluding raids which take more time to master/beat through typically). You do dailies every single day (if you can stand doing them), nests every week (that are boring once you've learned them which takes about a week because it's literally doing the same thing every time you do them over and over which goes for any content released in this game) and the same applies to raids after a bit too. You also grind dungeons for drops, maybe grind some other various things the game has for gold and that's.. it. The game itself is fun, the combat is good and all that but all you're doing in the game is the same thing over and over and over every day in order to gear up which takes time just so you can enjoy and participate in the end game raids. There's nothing else to do, it's all instance based and not open world so you're doing this or afking.. It's just.. a shame, it's not worth your time. You'll have fun at first but by the end of it the boring, repetitive, and chore like content you need to do to get strong every day and week heavily outweighs the fun you'll have with new fresh content. Again, this is only the main flaw and only a flaw to those who aren't playing the game casually, there's a million other problems to this game stacked on top of it that I haven't mentioned aside from how static it is. There's better stuff out there to enjoy and Black Desert is coming too which has potential. If you're looking to play a game and enjoy/invest your time in it and have fun (The reason most people play games in general), this isn't for you. It's a great game to casually play though as the combat really is just that good.~Person who's played this game since close to the initial release			"

												It truly breaks my heart giving this game a negative review. This game used to be my most favorite MMORPG, simply from its action-oriented and non-targetting combat style, w/ its good community (from what I saw). Don't be misjudged by my hours of playtime, I had to run it on Nexon as for some reason the steam version never worked for me.So, what's so bad about it now?For starters, the playerbase is basically dead. I predict a few more months or maybe some years, and the game will be completely dried out of players. If you're new, wanting to play, you most likely won't come across anyone who will play w/ you as most are just lvl 90+, and have no interest in doing such little tasks for a person who will inevitably get bored and leave. That brings me to my next point: The level cap. Before, the level cap was 60-70, a good level cap for this game in my opinion. However, apparently from the time I was on hiatus until recently, they've changed the cap to 93 (I think)So, instead of fun dungeon-crawling with random people or guild-mates, you're stuck basically grinding alone in a dead server to reach 93 and get some actual good stuff.3-4 years ago, this game WAS MY LIFE. I would NOT stop gawking about it to friends, trying to get them to play, then them join and have a blast w/ me. Now?Now it's a dead place with hardly any chat in global andno one to dungeon crawl with (which, people to hang out with was one of the best parts, and grinding to such a level on your own would eventually wear you out). Just that, is enough to pull me away from this. Now something for all those verteran players like me, that kinda set us off. Apparently, around september 2016 and before, you could switch your account to EYEDenity (Nexon had control over DN first, then it was switched to Eyedenity). HOWEVER, if you didn't transfer it between that deadline, all your content was erased. Yep. MEANING, If you have a lvl 70 character, with some REALLY good gear, and you payed REAL LIFE Money on the game, that was all for nothing, as it was erased on the transfer. Granted, I never spent a dime on it, but it aggitated me, trying to use my Nexon account, finding out it wont work, and having that ONE Character I spent hours upon hours to get to lvl 50 with a single friend, which the file had a lot of memories for me. It's a sad tale, a wonderful game turned into.... this. Sorry to say, but I can't recommend it :(.			"

												I love this game. One of the first to implement a dynamic combat system into an mmorpg. This feature is incredibly fun and requres skill to aim at your enemies in order to use spells and such. Classes are gender-locked and are somewhat generic. Some translations are a little bit off as well. If you can overlook these cons, you get an incredibly fun game to play. I recommend playing around in a guild so you can play in nests on later levels so you can get optimal gear and money. 9/10			"

Patch day hits and the devs gave us a few level 90 dungeons and TOOK OUT EVERY DUNGEON BELOW 90! On top of that, they took away higher diffculties that allowed players to get higher exp rewards. They took away more content than they put in. These developers are terrible. I wont even hit on their Pay to Win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cosmetics and allys. Bad game is bad.			"

												(Written from perspective of a level 15 warrior)Easy to get into, simple and intuitive controls are good for playability but the technique is more than just ""mash buttons until everything's dead,"" although that is my play style as a solo warrior... Definitely more fun than WoW so far, although I have yet to see how the late game is.Art style is nice, I enjoy the overdone attack effects and the silly-but-still-dangerous low-level enemies.It seems a little on the easy side, I can solo dungeons on hard with little difficulty (adrenaline is another matter, however) but I can see where parties will be helpful, especially for non-warriors. Gobarta is no sweat, I can tank through it pretty easily but there's still that level of difficulty I like.Overall, a cool little game that's totally worth the low, low price of $0.00.			"

												I would probably recommend this game without a second thought 3-4 years ago back when it was 60-70 lvl cap not today though. Before looking at my 33hours on record and thinking i didn't play the game enough i probably have around 2K hours on the SEA server so trust me i played more then enough of this game and i can say without doubt the game is just dead at this point. They bsaically reworked the entire game to where only late game matters after you reach max level and by the time this review is posted max level is 93 so around lvl1 to 93 is just a grind fest and with the game being already pretty much dead most likely its going to be a solo grind then with actual players. Getting partys for raids and such is so hard if your new basically if your new and looking for a mmo game dont bother with this its not new user friendly at all you will feel you are playing a solo game until you reach max level and get good gear. 3 years ago : HELL YEAH PLAY THIS GAME so much fun doing nests ( 4 man really hard dungeouns ) and dragon nests ( 8man raid ) just do main quests / side quests or grind up with party members today : solo grind to 93. find a way to obtain good gear somehow. try to find a party or guild to do raids with ( too much hassle and pain not worth it anymore )			"

												I figure i've played long enough at this point to write a review.To begin, the combat in this game is really satisfying. You cannot expect to faceroll everything and walk away with your life, you need to pay attention to enemy attacks and dodge accordingly. Especially in Nests (boss raids) as you cannot use health potions (though support classes do exist, and they have party heals)  inside Nests, so being careful and dodging properly is especially important.There are many different classes, each with their own unique playstyle. Whether you want to play a close range Archer who specializes in kicks and hurricane attacks, an Ice Witch who flings off a relentless barrage of ice spells and turns everything into ice cubes, or maybe you feel like playing a Stank-a** Cleric who drops totems on the field and explodes them or some s***. You get the point, there's a ton of different classes.Best of all? No more Nexon.  If you're a fan of Fast-Paced Action-RPGs with Giant Dragons and s***, try the game. You won't regret it.			"

												So, I've hit 200 hours in Dragon Nest, and I've compiled some information for everyone who may be wondering, ""Is it worth playing?""In short, YES.Here's a Pros-Cons List.Pros:-Extremely fun, fluid, face-paced, intense action combat-NOT pay-2-win AT ALL. Especially compared to other games in this genre.-PvP is REALLY fun too-SO many classes to choose from. All are unique-Leveling up characters isn't horrible-Good community-In-game economy is pretty good, compared to other MMOs-You can cosmetically and audio mod it a little bit to your liking (with help from Google that is, I won't tell you how here.)-Game has been going long and strong since lvl 40 cap, now at 93 cap-Nexon hasn't ruined it don't worry. -New publisher seems very nice, although they have that Engrish.-You earn a +50% EXP bonus to every character on the account (Up to 250%) for each character you have at max level.-You won't need to pay for character expansions (You get 25 character slots)-You won't need to pay for inventory expansions (You get 4/5 30-slot bags to carry all your stuff)-Events for free pets (which pick up items) are every holiday.-Cash shop items can be earned for free, because of events.- +200% EXP Scrolls that last for 7 days can be purchased for $2.50 and will easily get you to max level if you grind moderately (3-4 hours a day) for a few (4-7) days.Cons:-Leveling can be tedious sometimes (running the same dungeon 20 times to get one level, UNLESS you have capped characters.)-If you don't have any gold in the beginning, it's hard to earn it right off the bat (only for your first character though)-Slight learning curve for those unfamiliar with games of this type-Cash shop armor is incredibly expensive, $28 for one permanent set for one character (although at max level it won't be hard to earn the gold to buy from other players)-Cash shop armor has some unfair stats. For example: One weapon gives +800 Phys. and Magic Damage, but at the max level that's hardly notable. (but, it's all earnable from playing the game and buying it from other players)-Cash shop gacha is expensive, and gives some really good items, still not pay to win though.Summary:Yes, it's worth playing. I recommend it. You can play and be a good player without paying. Convenience for leveling can be speeded up with cash shop items, and some cash armors give considerable stat boosts, but nothing so unfair that you will want to quit the game.			"

												The game looks great, I've heard nothing but good things about it... Problem is it installs a rootkit-style service that keeps you from closing the process using ... Anything (Even taskkill /f as admin), outside of the game itself.This game monitors your processes using 'Ahnlab Hackshield Pro'. If you're okay with that, then by all means play it - it looks great. But for those of you who don't like the idea of a company installing a rootkit on your system that keeps you from closing processes and monitoring what you're doing, stay away.			"

												Now, the veterans can defend this game all they like, but I started playing the game around the day that the infamous level 90 patch came out so let me release a review from the viewpoint of a new play who has reach level 75 and stopped playing due to immense boredomPros>Combat System-The combat system is the only thing that this game has going for it, you can pull intricate strings of combos and abilities>Classes-Each class is unique and awesome, I love how they all lookCons>EVERYTHING ELSE!-Let me elaborate>Any dungeons below level 90 are SUPER MEGA ULTRA..... easy-Apparently, these dungeons USED to be difficult, but they decided to completely F***ING remove the hardest difficulties for all low level dungeons. The nests are easy when they used to require a party, (I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO PARTY FOR THE FIRST NEST) you take no damage while the enemies all die in one hit, and you can't even stumble over to higher level dungeons if you want a challenge because it's barred by a level cap, and by the time you reach the recommended level for the dungeon, it'll be too easy. I was waiting for the game to get difficult FOR 75 LEVELS. I WAS ONE SHOTTING EVERY ENEMY AND BOSS IN EVERY DUNGEON FOR 75 LEVELS! At that point, if the game can provide zero excitement for what was essentially 70% of the game, then it's not good game design. And I'm patient, oh I'm very patient, I'm always willing to give a game a chance, but this game could not impress me, it took too long.>Story missions progress way too slowly-I won't talk too much for this one. Basically, once you reach level 60, the dungeons that you have to traverse through for the story will have a recommended level of 45. Not to mention, really intimidating monsters appear in the story cutscenes a lot, and you end up getting excited at the fact that you'll be able to finally get a challenge, only to have your  character get stomped on in the cutscene and have the bad guy run off with the important McGuffin that you were sent to chase after and you instead have to fight some insignificant boss, that just basically ends up becoming a miniboss in later dungeons. But hey, at least there's occasional voice acting and almost every character has a unique personality why you can then elborate on through giving them gifts, but that's only fun if you're actually interested in this game's story.>PvP is ""Balanced""-Unless you're playing with friends who are around the same level as you, you're essentially not allowed to PvP until you're level 90. Oh, don't worry though, there's and equalizer put into play so that your stats are basically increased to what they would be around level 90. The problem is that your skills still do garbage damage against players who have more points put into their skill trees, have better armor, and have learned their combos while you have nothing to protect yourself with.. The equalizer just makes killing you take like 30 more seconds than it should.Don't play this game unless you have a time machine. I've heard countless good things about the game before the update, all things that I wish I could've been a part of, but from what I can guess, the developers wanted to make it easier to reach level 90 to appeal to players who want have level 90 characters for all the classes, and for some reason they decided to remove content that didn't need to be removed in the first place.

												TL;DR It's a solid title- worth a look, for sure. ^.^I played a little of Dragon Nest waaaay back when (maybe a little of the beta?), and put in maybe ~20 hours or so before I downloaded this on Steam.Anyhoo- from a gameplay perspective, Dragon Nest resembles Vindictus. You choose a (gender-locked) class, run around a shared town hub and accept quests, then delve into instanced dungeons, slay monsters to transition between areas, and face a boss in the final room.I'll get a bit more specific...GAMEPLAY- As outlined above.You do learn new skills fairly quickly, which are infinitely more entertaining to use than your basic attack combos. There's a level up reward chest you can open every time you level up, as seen in several f2p titles. Dragon Nest has... taken an interesting approach with their iteration; at level 6, you are granted a costume set that- when equipped- grants your character hp and damage far beyond normal means. It will essentially trivialize most content you come across, and is on a 7-day timer. A second identical set is granted at another level, but I forget what it was, exactly...That being said, it's a lovely little feature if you've played before and want to barrel through story and get into the meatier content. I'm not sure if such a system would be detrimental to a new player's experience- if a time comes when the items expire and that overwhelming power is lost, it may be a bit of a shock having to suddenly rely on player skill and skill synergies... although to be fair, joining parties/guild may help alleviate that issue... I can't assert anything on that issue quite yet.GRPAHICS- Cute, albeit simplistic aesthetic.Most things (the older assets for sure) are noticeably low-poly, but it looks like a lot of love went into the textures. The effects on most skills are bright and flashy, and could end up obscuring gameplay in larger groups. But solo, I've had no problem keeping up with things.Once again comparing this to Vindictus, Dragon Nest is considerably more gentle on my computer's aged hardware. I honestly think a laptop less than 5 years old could handle this pretty well.STORY- It actually has one, and it's pretty good.The story arc you experience differs to some degree between each class. Sometimes a lot, sometimes a little. Dialogue is generally pretty funny and light, but there are heavier plot points here and there. Characters are a little... melodramatic, perhaps. But I find I like more characters than I find annoying... so that's nice.AUDIO/SOUND/MUSIC- Nothing really stands out, but nothing's downright terrible... not even the voice-acting.Sound effects are loud and bombastic. Music is decent, but the loops are relatively short and can overstay their welcome before too long, so I've disabled it. My biggest complaint is that ambient sounds are directly tied to music, so with that muted, towns and forests sound dead... but still- just queue up your own playlist or internet radio or podcast or whatever. :PCOMMUNITY- Haven't had a lot of dealings with people yet, but things don't seem particularly toxic, at any rate.There's one server, broken up into channels. I've made a point to select low-pop channels just to avoid crowds, but global chat has stayed relatively quiet. I have no idea if there are just that few people playing, or if more conversations are simply being held in party/guild chat... I certainly hope Dragon Nest isn't ""dying"", as I do find it rather enjoyable.CASH SHOP- Doesn't appear to be buy-to-win..?Basic cosmetics (costumes, and a few exclusive faces and hairstyles for most classes), crafting boosters and whatnot. I have yet to purchase anything, and don't feel like I really have to. I call that a win.EXTRA- Just some little tidbits I didn't work into the fields above.-There's a mercenary system that lets any class bring a ""combat pet"" of sorts into dungeons. It IS stuck behind a few walls; beyond the three starter mercs (which you will be able to choose one upon completing a lvl24 quest), the rare and epic varieties have to either be grinded for, or bought off of the player marketplace. Some of the available mercanaries are npc's from certain class' storylines, so even if you don't really NEED a mercanary, it can be entertaining to battle along side them, and see them toss out a one-liner once a dungeon is cleared... could become more necessary once those super-costume items expire, and you aren't running with a party/guild.-There's PvP available as early as lvl10, but it's something I've not touched, nor really plan to... like other games, there is a PvP based currency and a variety of items to be bought.-MOST classes, with the exception of the Lancea, Machina, and two elite classes, will recieve a specialization quest at lvl15, and can subsequently choose one of two secondary classes. This choice grants a second skill tree to develop and populate your hotbar with. The skills from this second tree generally require a certain weapon type be wielded, so bear that in mind when the time comes. For the classes with no specialization choice, your second skill tree simply unlocks when you reach lvl15.-Building on that, your choice of weapon type affects your basic attacks/combos. You'll begin with a starter weapon of each type, so try them out early on and get a feel for them. ^.^Think that's it... again, I've yet to experience the full gamut of what Dragon Nest has to offer, so please correct me if I'm wrong about something. o3o			"

												Spent a lot of hours playing this with my girlfriend, been too long since I last played but I highly suggest. Great game, lot of fun played with a party, less fun playing alone but still a good experience for anyone who likes RPG games. The combat is probably my favourite thing about the game, real-time action and a lot of moving around and dodging. The graphics are still really good and can run on older computers with no problem. The only critique I can make, as well as being an aspect that I really like and something unique about the game is the session-based arenas in which all combat takes place. On one hand I quite like having them in sessions and having a set objective and path each time, but it becomes repititive if you have to complete several quests over some levels in the exact same area. I do, however, enjoy having to master each location and looking at different ways on dealing with the mobs/bosses. Overall, if I ever get the time/companions to play this game again, I totally would. 10/10 fun.			"

												If you want to get into a free to play mmo, this is the one to play. It has the action combat and storyline of a single player rpg, with the social mechanics of an mmo. EDIT: don't let my game time throw you off, I played this game a bunch before it came to steam.Pros:-Great combat-Unique graphics/art style-Fun NPC dialogue with some good voice acting-Challenging bosses with selectable difficulties (which offer better rewards when completed at the higher difficulties)-Good Variety of classes-decent party/guild/social system-nice soundtrack-interesting, followable story line-plent yof sidequests and events-satisfying character progression-Not pay to win! Cash shop weapons/armor generally do not provide stats, only cosmetics-semi-complex crafting systemCons:-Can be a little grindy in certain level gaps (eg 18-24)-Gender locks on classes-not a huge variety when it comes to character custimization without paying for cash shop items-not open world (I prefer open-world mmos, but that is just my opinion. this game would have a lot of potential issues if it was open world)			"

												Well. I tried all of the classes but Lancea was by far my favorite one. Probably one of the better ones too because of the wave clear : ))) I got a little annoyed with the farming experience but I usually stack up on all of the quests in the town then to go the dungeons i need too.I have never really played or got into a MMORPG game but this got me hooked.+ not p2p more like f2p+ cool story line+ graphics are cool+ u can make npc your babe (i lov u lunaria )+ cool ♥♥♥ level designs+ community is nice and v helpful especially in guilds. - cant switch genders when making character??- can be boring playing by yourself- i dont have any friends- cant marry lunaria or lena- blacksmith kinda gives off a weird feeling and breaks your ♥♥♥♥ if you dont give him jellies- argenta = bdsmTLDR; TRY IT			"

												The Good:-The best combat system of any RPG I've ever played. The system involves having an abundance of awesome skills at your disposal and several fighting game mechanics. The system is perfect for creating a ton of different combos that flow together very nicely.-Leveling up is always rewarding. Not only will you see very noticable differences in your performance with new gear, new skills are unlocked frequently.-While the class selection may appear small at first, each class branches out into 2 paths twice. So with the current 6 classes available, that's really like having 24 classes.-Each class feels unique. This includes the classes that are made from branching out. Lunar Knights and Gladiators may both be Swordsmen, but the only similarity between the two will be a couple of basic skills and their character model.-PVP has a great amount of variety. You can join a 1 on 1 lobby to fully experience the fighting game mechanics, you can participate in hectic 16-player team deathmatches, free-for-alls, and ""kill the other team's leader"" matches, or you can play the ghouls mode, which is a standard zombie mode that functions well as a completely level-free form of PVP.-Higher-level PVE and PVP demand a high amount of skill from players.-Leveling up is mostly painless. There will be patches of grinding you'll do here and there, but the grinding in this game is much less repetitive than in other RPGs.-Every skill you are given has a purpose. There are very few skills that become obsolete.-Tons of stat builds to choose from.-The voice-acting is full of personality when it's there. Voice-acting is most prevalent during combat, with many skills making the character using them say something. Important NPCs also have voice-acted greeting and farewell lines.-The main story is solid and easy to follow, even if you're like me and skip through most of the dialogue. It will also provide cinematics to spice things up from time-to-time.-If you put in the time to read it, the dialogue for main and side quests is well-written and genuinely funny.-Locations are very diverse and well-designed.-A unique art direction that combines cute with badass perfectly.-It's easy to find parties at peak player activity times.-Tons of seasonal and update events with useful rewards.-A solid guild system with features such as custom guild emblems, guild storage, and guild buffs.The Bad:-The format of the world. While it's perfectly functional, it's a huge shame that this game isn't an open world. The only time you'll ever feel like you're in a populated world is when you're in a main town. As soon as you leave one, the only players you'll have any physical contact with is whoever is in your party, which only includes up to 3 other players at a time. There will be a few NPCs out in the non-main town areas, but they don't help the feeling of loneliness very much.-All PVE gameplay is instance-based, and the instances, while being highly detailed and just right in length, are usually a linear path. Sometimes quests will give you additional objectives besides getting to the end of an instance, but that only happens rarely.-Minimal character customization to start out with.-You'll have to ask around for info on the game's deeper mechanics such as paralyze, super armor, and knockdown.-Skills are not always described nearly well enough. Skill descriptions never provide information like how many invincibility frames a skill has, how strong it's ability to break super armor is, etc.-Armor sets that you don't buy with real money only have one appearence per rarity. For example, a common and a rare set of armor will look different, but a level 20 set of rare armor will look exactly the same as a level 50 set of rare armor. This happens in a few cases with weapons too, but not usually. Curiously, headgear is a part of all gear sets, but will never be visible on characters unless it's one of the epic-rarity headgears (which do actually have differing appearances compared to other epic headgears).-Server instability can be an issue at times.-The things that cost real money are terribly over-priced. A full set of cool-looking armor that gives some extra stat bonuses costs about $20, though you can reduce the price a bit if you're willing to ""rent"" the armor for a limited time instead. Having played Nexon games that use this format of over-priced microtransactions since 2005, I have never bought a single thing from these shops and have enjoyed the games anyway. As a side note, you can earn NX (the currency used for these microtransactions) for free, but the means of doing this often involve a LOT of personal information sharing to a LOT of shady websites. If you try to use fake personal information, you'll end up like me and get permanently banned from the service.(Overall, the cons aren't very significant, so just give this game a try)			"

												[SRS][Respect the tag]TL;DR Cliffs:Review from a veteran of DN (back in 60 cap). I've also played a LOT of MMORPGs like WoW, Flyff, Raganarok Online, RS, MS, and more.Pros:Best combat system I've seen out of 11 MMORPGSkill-based gameplayDress-up Simulator 2017Skills are huge. Mounts are huger. Bosses are hugest.Game mechanics promote cooperative play.Fun communityGood storyline33 classes with wildly different playstyles.Balanced classesCons:Content is at level cap, grinding is mind-numbingly easy.LOL Economy. 6g a quest, 3k for a L-Grade enhancement ATTEMPT.RNG. It's depressing.Almost no character customization.PS2-era graphics.8/10, would return from hiatus again.Full ReviewThe game's changed a lot since I last played it. With every patch the power creep gets a little stronger. However, the instanced dungeons also get harder as well. For instance, this last patch added in a new class, the Arch Heretic, and updated our daily quest dungeons. We went from having bosses with maybe 20m hp to bosses wih about 200m.Updates:Game Devs keep the game regularly updated. The Devs are actually based out in Korea (known as kDN) and NA gets their updates a couple of months later. Luckily, this generally means that we get our updates prebalanced. Most recently, this meant our Tinkerer Awakening for the Adept class wasn't broken; we got it all in one patch. kDN, on the other hand, had the Adept class catapult to a top tier buffer, debuffer, and number 1 DPS before getting her rebalanced.Of course it's also bad thing, since ED's one of the worse publishers of DN and it takes about a month for new content to be translated. While I know they aren't the direct developers, having incomplete released content months after other publishers get it out.... it just strikes me as lazy. God knows I wouldn't play DN NA if it wasn't the only one available.The game is well balanced. Though it's hard to say sometimes since everyone hits OMGWTFBBQ damage at endgame. To place this in perspecive, you go through the storyline with up to 40k attack. Beginner cap equipment instantly puts you above 100k, not counting bonus multipliers from Elemental conversions and Awakened skills.Combat:The combat was amazing years ago and it's amazing now. In fact, I'd argue that it's even better now. While the game was more active back in 60 cap, the classes weren't balanced, with my capped Acrobats/Tempests being outdamaged by ungeared level 30 Sorceresses. Ouch. Now every class is about equal in terms of party benefit, with some being situationally better. This is a GREAT thing, since that means every class is accepted in public parties with the only criteria being your experience or gear.Moreover, the combat is really satisfying. The game, with its PS2 graphics, delivers some very impressive skills and combos, with large explosions of every color. Certain classes have really tight skill rotations and you have to keep up with managing them while dealing with Mechs.For instance, while fighting the first boss on Typhoon Krag Nest HC, you have to DPS the Gardener boss while killing any blue mushrooms counting down. While doing this, you have to stay away from any green mushrooms on the map if you're marked by the Orc Bomber. You have to dodge the Orc Bomber's attacks while keeping them from accidenally hitting the green mushrooms. If the blue mushroom counts down, or you accidentally hit the green mushroom cause the Gardener smacked you into them, the entire party takes a mapwide attack. You can tank these, but the harder Nests like have insta-kill mechanics that you MUST learn or you will kill your entire team.PvP:As for PvP, the combat is still really fun, fast, with intuitive and free-flowing combos. However, ladder rankings are unstable since so many new classes and awakenings are being added in. The meta changes before it's even developed. Yikes. The nice thing is that no one take PvP too seriously, and they won't rage just because they lost. PvP is completely skill based, and the developers have their own section just for PvP balancing.Even better, to help deal with power creep, every skill is rebalanced in PvP. A debuff that would normally last 30s becomes 10s, a. In a sense, PvP is another game entirely and one that I highly recommend getting into. WARNING: This game has one of the highest learning curves I've ever seen for PvP. You will lose and you will lose very badly until you learn all of the classes, combos, and i-frames.Player Friendly?The community is pretty solid. There are a few toxic people, but the game itself rewards cooperative play. You literally get more drops at the end of dungeons, use less Empowerment, and get team-revives just from having more people playing with you. Guilds are super nice and easy to get into, and they're always down to teach new and returning players.This last update updated a ""Growth Guide"" which gives new players a full set of Theano gear and Weapons. Generally, new players would have to spend a few weeks building up a set; now you're given one and can proceed to more endgame stuff without being straight carried.However, the economy is in shambles. Remember how I said ED takes what kDN developers update and release it here? Yup, they did that again. However, they never updated gold costs while simultaneously lowering gold acqusition to the lowest of the servers. The real killer is enhancement costs, which are necessary to tackle harder content.To put this into perspective, you get about 6g per end-game quest. (1g for ""talking"" quests). It costs a few hundred gold to CRAFT legendary equipment. It costs thousands to attempt to enhance it to an appropriate level (at like 10% enhancement rate...) let alone silly equipment like crests that add Final Damage for 40k+.It's gotten to the point where players SELL dungeon runs because it's faster and cheaper for normal people to pay geared people to bring them than to attempt to get geared themselves first. To put this into perspective again, one IDN HC run (you need at least 2 runs for a shoe) costs 3.5k gold.Now for the ugliest part; RNG and P2W. This game is slightly P2W, with extensive OP set bonuses for completing costume sets with accessories that can only be found in dragon eggs. Costume sets are $30, and dragon eggs are $1.50. These dragon egg items cannot be traded or shared, even with your own characters. Once RNG blesses you with a piece, you better pray that it's on a class you won't mind maining for a while.This newest Cold Mirage/Sadnyth set is notorious, with players reporting less than 0.2% drop rates for Sadnyth Tails. If you really want that tail, it'll most likely take you over $600 to get. Good luck. ED gives off 50 cents worth of points every day you log in though, so that helps a little.Misc:The classes are also gender locked. I didn't like it at first, but now I appreciate it, since it literally makes you the character in the DN storyline.There's a severe lack of customization. There's no points to upgrade Strength or Dexterity like traditional games. Your stats are based solely off of your equipment. You have little flexibility in what skills you get with Awakened skills requiring max level skills.You get like 4 hair colors to choose from. Any more and it's RNG or $.Note: To most of these negative reviews are people who lost their account when the game flipped publishers; You guys had over two months to switch. I lost my account too but I don't spend all day whining about it. Play or not, you can't say it's a bad game just because you didn't keep up with your updates. Please stop being the cancer in the gaming community who rate negatively just cause of one failed patch or ragequit.			"

												This game is great, I've got more than enough game time to prove that. The classes proved a refreshing twist on MMORPGs that many others fail to achieve. The combat is exciting and stylish on every class in both PvE and PvP even with unbalancing on classes. The story line is pretty interesting, if you decide to even pay attention to it. However this game is not without its fair share of flaws. I'll make a small list to explain some of the more pressing problems1. This IS a Nexon game, which if you know from their other games they treat the Chinese version of the game MUCH better.2. Stamina system, again another Nexon thing. Once you hit the (current) cap the game drains you stamina (called PWR here) in as little as two or three dungeon runs3. Juggling dominates PvP. You can find rooms that let you burn your PWR for medals known as ""chill"" rooms so it is not as big of a problem as the two aboveThis game is worth playing. However expect to be treated like crap by the customer support and just Nexon all together. It offers a great experience to both new and old MMORPG players.			"

												Pros - - NO game beats Dragon Nest's combat system- Great PVP- A large amount of classes each having branced off sub-classes- Challenging- A game of skill, gear is just to get things done faster- Classes have their own unique use- Awakening skills- Ultimate skills- End game gear is worth getting- Nexon is gone- A story, not a great one, but there's a story- Has a movie- Not too dead- All your powers make you feel overpowered even if you're weak- A fair amount of helpful players- We're mostly all cancerCons - - Some classes are quite weaker than the other- Unless the gear is a costume or end game gear, it all looks the same- Costumes give a huge buff in stats (Can either be baught by a huge sum of gold or real life money)- Not open world- Cash shop is needed if you wanna get somewhere about 100x+ faster			"

												Great Game when it came out, now not so much. It was innovative and kind of first of its kind. The only problem I have with DN and the main reason I stopped playing it is- I felt lonely. DN is a race to the top kind of game. It wasn't like that in the beginning but slowly became that. Everyone is racing to the top/cap and then after a while you've got newbie towns that become an absolute desert, and you've got no one to do instances with. The only time those towns become populated again is when they release a new character. If you play this game with friends, then it'll be a fun game to play and I'd recommend it. However, if you're thinking about coming in by yourself, then I'd say don't bother. It'll be fun at first, but you'll eventually feel lonely and will stop playing. DN is also a highly competitive game. If you don't have a gaming mouse, don't even step into the arena.			"

												This is a MMORPG. The usual aspects are all there. The grinding, the level, the cosmetics, the cash grab. Apart from all that however, it is surprisingly fun. The dynamic combat system varies from class to class; no two classes play the same way. Skills trees are varied and unique, and is overall implements a pretty seamless fighting style. The graphic are mediocre at best, with rather outdated texutres and sometimes glitchy models, but is certainly acceptable. The game is poorly optimized for AMD GPUs be warned, it is very hard to run at smooth FPS's, and textures will sometimes not display properly.Overall very fun time killer, though some polishing would definetly help.

												I would like to start off by saying that this is a wonderfully thought out game. I admire the movesets and fighting system. The graphics are nice and all.Now let me get to what I don't like:Hardly any character customization- There are 6 classes, 2 males 4 females. You can't change genders and you get a limited amount of custom bits.The game feels empty despite dungeons and quests-The lack of attack versatility beyond the few attacks makes it start to feel repetitively linear-I wish I could get myself to play this and like it for longer than whatever my play time is, but despite playing every character and trying all of their initial movesets and the secondary moveset of the warrior. Leaving me still saying: Empty.			"

												Dragon Nest is a game from Nexon, the evil minds behind Maple Story. This game plays very much like Vindictus with various tiers of difficulty in each mission area, different loot, different bosses/moves/hp imcreased, etc. The thing that separates this from Vindictus is the cuteness of it all. This is a very ""cute"" game where everything is nice and bright and the conversations you have with NPC's are downright funny quite often. You never know what they'll end up talking to you about before you accept a quest or are just improving relations with them.You can pick a few different classes but they are all gender locked. A fighter is male and a sorceress is female for example.This game is hard to describe if you haven't played Vindictus because that game has very similar ....everything! It's just a tad more.You can crafticular mission area and so on. It's worth trying this game just to see if you like it. I often sit down intending to do just one mission or two and end up playing for hours. Definitely the sign of a good game.			"

												I love this game. I've loved it since beta, it is the bar for F2P games. I played all of my characters to max level, and never had to pay to win, just buy fancy outfits, and mounts. However, there's a way to get that kind of stuff without paying. This game is on my top 3 list of games. Since I've leveled every base class to 80, I can say that it starts off kind of slow, but there are lots of helpful players who will grind you through the lucrative missions, and solo nest for you. You just have to ask, and this game will be rewarding, fun, and versitile. The PvP is also top notch, though a little unbalanced, but it can still be fun. Oh, and read the story, it's actually a good one. Enjoy.			"

												While I have played this game for a long time, I've had my fun with it. The combo system is good, but rarely has any effects on actual gameplay other than PVP where literally you cannot win without better stats. This game isn't as Skill to Win as it used to be, according to most of my friends who have played it for a long time. Although this game has a pretty good base and whatnot, grinding on the same dungeons just becomes really boring. Do I recommend this game? Yes and no.The PVP system is a bit flawed, but I can see where it has its fun parts. The dungeon and EXP system itself are pretty good, looting system along with them. But I do not encourage buying stuff in this game with real money, since it's pretty much just a waste.The variety of classes in this game is also a good thing to mention. But some classes definitely rise up higher than others do, which really disappoints me.The story becomes really repetitive but the only entertaining parts are when you get to actually see the story of your own character. Other than that, it's just the main story of the game.As I said, I don't exactly recommend this game but I have solid hopes for it.			"

												This is easily the best MMO I have ever played. The combat in this game is the only 1 of its kind. Very fast paced and fluid. It feels and looks amazing when taking down huge groups of enemies in seconds. There will be almost 50 different job classes when the Assassin is released. Lots of different things to do besides just questing. Huge achievement system. The dialog is well written and humorous on most NPCs. Theres no reason not to play this when its a free game.Edit: Assassin is released!			"

												Cons:  -RNG on RNG gearing system makes gearing difficult and time consuming  -People who treat the game like a job neglect new players  -Your tickets will be answered within 1-5 years (Literally)  -Game has had past troubles balancing classes and gameplay  -Can get repetitive and requires much grinding  -Gender locked classes with limited customization  -Early game leveling ends up being mostly soloed and everything is end game based  -An often lack of communication in what the game wants: may be hard for new players to get used toPros:  -Brilliantly fun fast paced action combat system  -A rather kind community overall, with exceptions as always.  -Challenging skill based PvP  -A wide range of classes to choose from  -Fast paced leveling  -A very manga plot if you're into that  -Not Open world (It is instance based); which I like but can be a turn off for others  -Interesting mechanics that require the players to learn the battle's ins and outs  -Always something new to get excited about  -Easy to get sucked in for all eternityI'd like to say, for those salty over Mists of Peril the update wasn't a shock, really. I was actually grossly excited about T5 finally fixing all the issues: the class discrimination, the elemental party imbalances, and I even like the new UI after I finally got used to it. I will miss the old content, as some of it I never got the chance to enjoy, but what can anyone really do?T5 was a long overdue update and altogether I think T5 has improved the game,except RNG on RNG. But I don't think that'll ever get fixed.You can expect an action MMORPG, with a not quite as in-your-face 'give us money' campaign as compared to a lot of other free MMO's. If you hold vanity as a need you'll see a lot more difficulty on that front, as well as if you treat the game like a job and need the best of everything.You can do end game content with a little effort without putting money in, but some people will always have a stick up their bottom trying to be better than everyone else. The game will be work if you do that though.What makes me adore the game is and always has been the combat though. It is unlike anything I've had the pleasure to enjoy in other games.As a veteran player whose put over 100 hours into the steam version, and at least 300-500 hours prior to getting the game on steam, I recommend the game, with all its troubles.

												Dragon Nest is a fun game for those tired of tab-targetting games. It is fast paced and entertaining. I will list some of the pros and some of the cons to the game.Pros:-Cute chibi style animation-Unique classes and specializations-Live-action combat (yes you have to aim)-Good story-Supports different playstyles (pvp, pve elitists, and pve casuals)-Leveling is pretty easy-Decent ability to replay (reroll multiple characters)Cons:-Repetitive quests (you will have to do the same dungeon several times)-Not new player friendly (takes a lot of getting used to as far as crafting, build guides, rotations, and how to obtain gear)-Not very challenging until higher levels-Cosmetics (costumes, while visually appealing, give stats and you have to pay real money for them, I am cheap so no thank you)-Small community (good luck finding answers to your questions, most people just wing it)-The running animation is hilarious in the worst way for all classesWhen all is said and done it is a very fun game that is easy to get into but difficult to get into competitive content. I would label it more as a casual game. For a free to play game it is not pay to win, but it is pay to look better than everyone else and have a bit of an edge as far as stats if you buy costumes and pets. It may not be perfect but it is a great game to kick back with friends who are tired of playing other things. "

												1. 7 classes with dynamic, purely skilled based combat...HOWEVER many classes are nerfed to the point of uselessness, so join the bandwagon classes or enjoy playing alone. Parties seek specific classes/will not play with specific certain classes so do your research first. Unbalanced class system. This applies to both PVP and PVE, but mostly to PVE. PVP is awesome and absolutely skill based, with equipment not so much [they nerf equipment to balance the playing field a little, better equipment is still advantageous].2. Plenty of guilds/active player base... HOWEVER they're not the cream of the crop people, there are nice players but more than half the time you'll deal with immature ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that devote a bit too much time [and real life money, with microtransactions reaching several hundred dollars] on this game. That being said, if you're looking for VERY active people to regularly play with, this is the right game.3. Free to play entirely... HOWEVER the microtransactions does give VERY NICE boosts in-game. For example, end game you might have.. 800k HP. But with a $30 costume, you can have 900k HP without having to buy expensive gear. Costumes can also boost your movement speed [some classes are SLOW AS HELL], which is kind of nice. Some costumes are really cool, like robotic wings... or a dragon mount/pet... even fun things like a fluffy sheep.4. Unbelievable amounts of grinding, there's no way to avoid this. You can buy powerlevels, have fun with that. Grinding for max level then for decent gear, because the bosses hit HARD and unless your skills can avoid the bills, keep farming that gear. Also when partying with people they won't even play with you if you have bad gear... so YOU BETTER GRIND.5.  Speaking of #3 and #4, microtransactions can be used to.. avoid grinding for money a bit. You can buy items with real life money, and sell in game for gold.6. Noncombat skills available, just not purely combat oriented. HOWEVER ... 3 skills: cooking, fishing, farming. No one fishes/fishing is completely useless. Cooking is likewise the same and the ingredients for cooking are so weird/hard to obtain that it's not worth it [have to rely on RNG drop rates, not gathering]. Farms are overpacked/almost impossible to obtain farm spots unless you can acquire a few spots and obsessively watch over your spot so no one else takes it.7. Great story lines. "

												Okay, I'm just gonna start listing ♥♥♥♥ right off the bat here. -Pros.The combat is well executed, as to have reflex-based combat, instead of targeting, as do most other RPG's have that.Customization was okay, would have preferred there to be a bit more variety, armor wise, though. Excellent storyline, probably the best thing about this game. Animations for the skills are cool as hell to watch, as well as the skills themselves. Speaking of skills, very wide choice of skills, and specializations for your desired class. Graphics are brilliant, very well drawn, and simple. The way they should be. Isn't as pay to win as I thought it was gonna be.-Cons. REALLY, REAAALLLLYYY grind-esque experience, most of the game I was either grinding my character to the cap level, {which they are ALWAYS, changing.} Or, I'm paying others gold to boost me to those said higher levels. Game speed isn't always the best, as it likes to lag a LOT, It might just be me, though. Eh, who knows. Good variety of class choice, but they're genderlocked, so -1 for customization. The very buggy, and annoying ""HackShield"" always seems to ♥♥♥♥ its pants at random times, causing the game to crash, and me having to reinstall Dragon Nest. Multiple times, If I may add. Overall opinion?; Good combat, good graphics, good storyline. but ♥♥♥♥ everything else.			"

It is very easy to play since I've already reached the max level of the game and have done raids to get such overpowered gear. What I also truly admire about this game is that every time there is a maintenace. Remember, a maintenance. If that comes in handy. They'll give free items to everyone in the game as an apologize or inconvenience to people who were facing crashes, bugs, or maybe glitches. So far, game is enjoyable, free to play, and fun with friends, families, and cousins to play with. Kepp up the great work! Great job on always providing new content that players can enjoy about the game and giving away free items to newbies who don't much about the game or just started.			"

												dafksdj;fkja;dksfj; THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST FREE TO PLAYS IN EXISTENCE.The combat is spectacular. Never, in any game I have played so far, have I seen such a well-thought-out and complete combat system that allows everyone their own style and flair. It might be one of the coolest combat systems in existence. It's grand, and playing with others makes it so much more fun, to chain combos with others. It's not a FPS, its third-person and allows for so much more freedom. And you get to see spells being cast and moves being made, which makes so much cooler.The monsters are ridiculously easy, but that is overshadowed by the fact that there isn't much grinding in this game. Except for the time I had to wait 10 levels hoping and praying that I would get a wand in a random drop. This game isn't asking for your money unless you want really fancy mounts or cosmetics or costumes; it provides everything you need for free without grinding, and you get everything you need as you progress through the game.I will say that there may be too little clothes for comfort. But the character design and story is mindblowing. Serious props to the devs for taking 9 different classes and creating an overarching storyline that differs in litte ways for each class.And its also not TOO easy -- while leveling up is relatively fast, you need to spend your Skill Points wisely to get new skills and manage your old ones. And the class trees that allow specialization are great, and make the game take on so much more variety. Its great that any two people who start off with the same class will end the game with totally different specializations and playstyles.Overall, the pro's of this amazing game overshadow any possible cons. Great storyline, amazing combat, smart decision-making, and great design.Go get it!			"

												Interesting game. It has a variety of classes that adds a twist to whatever your playing from dungeons to arena, you have a advantage and disadvantage in this game. The gameplay:The game runs smooth during dungeons...BUT go near a market or something and huge spikes but can be handled. The dungeons themself are pretty good and fast, you either work as a team and target a weak mob with all your skills or a convenient high level person comes help you!The comooooooonity:The comoonity is alright not as good as other game comoonity but works. There are plenty of people that are willing to help you especially the high level people! There is also a mentor/pupil system that rewards you for helping your pupil or mentor etc etc.OVERALL:I quite enjoy this game and if you feel that you need to give this game 10 dollars don't do it on steam. You will get some random currency called Nexon Credit. Why is it bad? You can buy everything in shop with Nexon PREPAID. Credit gives you sadness and depression. How to get prepaid easy! Buy the pre paid cards such as KARMA or others! Would recommend to people.			"

												Great writing and combat. (Some)NPCs have enjoyable personalities for an MMORPG, and for each town I was in, there was always at least one NPC/questgiver that I loved talking to, and I would do their quests just to get them to say more things. Special attacks look and feel powerful. The ability to choose your difficulty for dungeons is nice, and Abyss is a great challenge.			"

I can tell that in the future the game will evolve into one of the top MMORPGs. The only problem with the game are some connection issues that kick you off the game. Although I haven't played for a long time unlike other people, these are issues that can be fixed easily.			"

I just wish it wasn't a pay to win ordeal, where you pretty much had to gamble real money to get decent gear. Earning gold is no problem. It's when you're not sporting decent gear to get into good runs and getting stomped that is upsetting. Sure, its a free game, and that's the catch. It's free. To a point. It's up to you whether or no you want to spend real money on it. Still fun. But to get into a nest with other people is a pain, and dying with a one hit blow that made me give up for a while.

												Seriously. This game is good. It's got real action based combat. The moves are like over the top fighting game specials. They even have a combo system. There's no filler. Every move has a purpose and is fun to use. It has a feeling unlike any other MMO out there. The story, amazingly, is really top notch. The presentation is exceptional. Yeah, the player wipe sucked. I lost my character too. But, it's pretty easy to get back to max level and there are other really interesting classes you can play to freshen it up. Each one even has it's own unique story. The graphics aren't demanding at all, any computer can run it, but it still looks really good somehow. They are also pretty generous with F2P items. You get special real money items every time you level up. Come and join me!			"

												While I have played this game for a long time, I've had my fun with it. The combo system is good, but rarely has any effects on actual gameplay other than PVP where literally you cannot win without better stats. This game isn't as Skill to Win as it used to be, according to most of my friends who have played it for a long time. Although this game has a pretty good base and whatnot, grinding on the same dungeons just becomes really boring. Do I recommend this game? Yes!!!The PVP system is a bit flawed, but I can see where it has its fun parts. The dungeon and EXP system itself are pretty good, looting system along with them. But I do not encourage buying stuff in this game with real money, since it's pretty much just a waste.The variety of classes in this game is also a good thing to mention. But some classes definitely rise up higher than others do, which really disappoints me.The story becomes really repetitive but the only entertaining parts are when you get to actually see the story of your own character. Other than that, it's just the main story of the game.But it's all worth it.			"

There are a few things i dislike.. cons: 1: the community can be harsh towards new players but not all the time..2: marketplace is usually overly priced on alot of different items..3: New players usually get left out due to them not knowing mechs of certain fights in Nest.4: pay too look pretty (aka) cant use steam wallet to purchase Nx points through Nexon.5: Grind to max lvl is rough for brand new players. (BUT) once u have a few max lvl chars.     it becomes very easy to cap out another char6: server lagg can be harsh make sure your ISP can handle the game or (DC's) left and right..Pros:1: game is fairly easy to get a handle on.2: Story line is great with their quest xp.3: being in a guild pays off4: graphics may seem too kiddy anime but have great skill effect graphics5: its easy to obtain gear once u get a grasp on the game6: Dont let it be a nexon hate thing their up to date with this game due to how many actually play "

												Traffic can be slow. Fills up fast during events and level cap raises (the lag can get pretty bad). Level cap is irritating. People usually quit/take a break not too long after they hit the current max level. Updates are slow to come. Guild system, friend list, dungeons, nests, market, drops, crafting, skill trees, the usual MMORPG stuff. Player verse player is super fast-paced and exciting. Various team modes and maps available. Characters are not very customizable and are gender-locked. Often you find yourself versing or partying up with your long lost twin. Graphics style not for everyone; anime-inspired.

												Hi, I'm an adventurer of indisclosed gender who randomly came upon a village one day and decided to save a girl I've met only once while she was being chased by a harpy. On the way to being savior of the world I killed every single one of the people dear to me by miraculously trusting the hidden villain 10 times out of 10. But I got a cool weapon from this dragon I killed and it's all okay.I used to give crap to Argenta for verbally abusing me every minute she sees me but she really is right. I am an utterly incompetent fool. I run around making bigger messes of everything, messes that often require one or another npc's life to clean up.But in all seriousness, DN is a decent game.It's a fun time waster. The battle system is fun and I didn't mind the grind (which, compared to some of the mmorpgs I've played in the past, wasn't really difficult at all. When I picked it back up I made cap on my legacy whatever char in 3 days and the other one hit 90s in a week, I wasn't even playing nonstop). I got bored eventually because I didn't really feel committed. And as for the story, well. I guess it's interesting, I was intrigued enough to follow it despite having to run the same 3 dungeons on repeat for each part (honestly, who decides to live in a place constantly infected with monstrocities and decide not to move?) But I was really serious when I say the PC is literally the stupidest, most gullible person alive. The main quest is always the shady person out of the cast of the characters asking you to fetch some god awful, powerful evil device for ""good"" and the pc shrugging and saying ""Why not? What harm could you possibly do with it, guy I just met yesterday?"" Tldr; If you like the battle system and don't mind playing it like a solo player (because just about everything except hardcore endgame content is doable alone if you have enough time and skill), then this is great. If you are expecting a welcome community, this isn't for you. If not for having friends that asked me to play this game with them I could probably go from level 1 to cap without talking to a single soul and that's something most people (me included) is not prepared to do.

												(Note: my steam playtime does not show my playtime with Nexon's standalone launcher from during the beta, actual playtime is around 80 hours)With regards to the PvE content, it contains the standard MMO tropes of leveling: experience points and stat based gear progression.The dungeons are fun, the monsters are neat, and the storyline is alright.The varied enemy types actually do different attacks and have slightly different A.I., even between palatte swaps.  If it looks different, it behaves differently.The cut scenes are entertaining i suppose, but its really all about combat.Leveling does eventually slow down dramatcially, once you run out of the standard ""go kill everything in this dungeon"" quests, requiring you to re-play dungeons and boss rooms, over and over, just to level up.With regards to the actual overall character progression, its mainly about upgrading your weapons (and armor too of course).This is where the Pay to Win comes in, but ill get to that in a minute.If you want to upgrade an item, you can minimally improve it up until level eight (the weapons level, not the character).Every time you upgrade an item, you spend the materials to perform the upgrade.Occasionally, the upgrade fails, meaning you lose the mats but keep the item.After level eight, you risk several random outcomes: breaking the weapon (or armor) entirely, downgrading the weapon by 3 levels, merely losing your mats with no change in stats,or actually upgrading the item by one level.The potential to completely lose your item is very real, and is especially painful, making you go back to previously played content to get a replacement, which you would then need to upgrade again.So, you can lose your item on a bad ""roll"" of the upgrade luck dice (metaphorical).What can be done about this?You can pay real money to buy ""seals"", which protect your item from breaking. (but not from the other potentially bad outcomes, such as deleveling the item.)The pay to win ethos permeates the rest of the game as well, with visual changes not actually being tied to the majority of the gear you can get through gameplay.Its sort of like if TF2 only let you buy hats, no crafting, no drops; they can only be bought with real money.The other problem with these ""costume"" items, is that they also give your character stats, such as ""permenant run speed increase of X %"", or ""+ str, + int"" etc.Now, on to the PvP stuff!  This is where DN shines.The PvP combat is epic, there are juggles, and tons of fun to use skills on timers (much like WoW).  DN combat is more about positional awareness, but it still relies on knowing what cooldowns are not active for your enemies.However, since there are juggles, if your ""get out of a juggle"" cooldowns are cooling down, then you're just hosed and can take a significant amount of damage while not being able to do anything about it, much like playing Marvel vs Capcom.This issue is even more present, since you're fighting more than one enemy at a time.Also, since DN is so focused on what gear you have and how upgraded it is, you are forced to play the PvE to level up, to get good gear, and to get the mats to improve your gear.  Additionally this means that PvP is more of a side thought, than a legitimate alternate way to level up or progress.Overall i had tons of fun with DN, but once you understand the upgrade system, why it is Pay to Win, and how PvE recycles content, id say its a worthy way to spend some time, but ultimately i felt cheated by its Cash Shop.Beware, Nexon may only be the distributor, but all of their games are notorious for abusing the Cash Shop mechanic, just like Dragon Nest does.

												Dragon Nest is probably one of the top 5 Free MMORPGs out there. With a top notch combat leveling system, and best in class PvP action, Dragon nest is defently a game that should be considered playing, if a fan of MMOs. The game starts you off with selecting a class of your choice and each of these classes have their own seperate main story lines that really add to the replayability. Keep in mind that these classes are gender locked and in total have 9 different options to chose from, The art style of the game is more anime and some of the NPC voice acting is hard to get through without cringing. The soundtrack is honestly top notch and when parred with the soundeffects of the game from the skills/abilities or simply basic attacking, creates an audio masterpiece. PvE inculdes a long enjoyable story sepperate for each class, alongside 100s of side quests and daily quests. PvP is extremely fun, arguably the best of all MMOs, all though, i wouldent recomend before level 35, due to most of the PvP community consists of max level charecters (90), and due to them being max level, not only do they have more experience, but they can easily trap you in a chain of attacks due to your lack of skills at a low level. Dragon nest is a heavily instansed bassed game, but if you can get passed the 5-15 seconds loading screens, this shouldent bother you. In the terms of character customisation, outside of the cash shop, your options are extremely lacking, however if you are willing to invest 5-10 dollars, you can begin to gain some freedom. On the topic of the cash shop, there are tons of options for not only costume, but actual in-game items aswell. Through steam you are able to use your steam wallet for the cash shop.Pros:-Top notch combat.-Tons of content in PvE.-Outstanding party play.-Unique dungeons.-Very cool combat animations.-Dungeons rate performances.-Competative and Enjoyable PvP.-Main Story line differs for each class.-Consistant art style .Cons:-Charecter appearence customisation is EXTREMELY lacking outside of the cash shop and micro transactions-Gender locked classes.-Some of the faces are just.....bad.-No customisable UI.-Heavily instansed bassed game.-Cringe worthy voice acting.-while yes there are a lot of side quests, some of them are straight up anoying.

												This game while not being the greatest is quite fun and the dungeons can offer some real challenge. The game is best played with friends so you can go dungeon diving together. It truly is a diamond in the rough and can be quite good fun if you just give it a chance it starts off pretty slow but ramps up fairly quickly. I highly recommend Dragon Nest to anyone looking for some good fun.			"

Also I started during an event so that is just an added bonus so start now!!! My only issue with this game is that when you need to exit a dungeon you take a screen cap, but thats easily over lookable			"

What I like About The Game1:Fast Action Combat2:Cool Combos And Ability3:Alot Of Different Armor Weapons Ect4:It Isnt P2W From What Ive Seen5:It is playedable and enjoyable even while playing solo.What I Disliked About The Game1:There are some quests that litterally make you go from 1 NPC on one side of the town and back like 10 times.2:The Missions get sometimes repetitive. 3:For Not playing very many MMOs the menus ect are still kinda confusing 4:The Game Doesnt explain everything really well you have to learn alot of things by yourself and finding quest (finding)5:You need to grind sometimes for a long time to level up to do the main quest (Its not bad just something i dislike)(I have 8 hours in the game in 1 day so i dont have much experience but in game time ive played  decent bit for 1 day...)KEEP IN MIND THIS IS MY OPINION.You can agree Or Disagree. We all have are own opinions.Also Sorry for bad spelling ect I didnt take much time to check my spelling and I Did Caps Like This some places but Not Others lol.			"

												This game WAS good before the most recent patch. Now I couldn't even jokingly suggest someone play this unless you are okay with there being nothing but a condensed story and the game being too easy to even learn your class until the level cap.Played far too much before getting the Steam version to fix a bugged skill on one character, but now... wasted download. None of the game is worth playing until late 80-90, and even that is apparently terrible and either mind-numbingly easy or the wrong version to be possible, since this patch nerfed the majority of everyone's abilities.

												I used to play on SEA server, and if I still remember correctly, Steam would put player on NA server I think?But the review would include both perspective anyway.Pros:-You get to kill dragon, gotta kill them all, Drago----you get to shoot beam from your swords, cast laser beam from the heavens, time stop people, shoot nightmarish arrows that chases people forever, launch a horde of ducks, play with Thor Hammer and even feel fabulous with lightning sparks booming around you.-Immersive combat system for both pve and pvp, very-Socially fun, especially with your friends IRL.Neutral (as varies between different country servers):-music-character (including npc) voicing-events (lay mostly on effort side instead of real-cash bonus side)Cons:-class discrimination and inbalance exists-hack and slashes skills does not cut through clothes-grind-repetetive-RNG over RNG over RNG, and effort intolerance.-gear can be accessed into a higher level in pvp with pay2win contents.-long loading screen throughout the world if you do not have a good spec-most of those Pros only applies in Late Game.despite being a free MMO (as usual), I'd still say the pros overweight the cons, though I would still not recommend it to player that are planning to dedicate most of their lifetime on this one since it gradually dies down and lower the element of [social entertainment]. 6/10 would definitely solo a dragon again with dead team mates.

												Honestly, I do not see how this game has a 'very positive' review score when compared to similar Free-to-play Action MMORPGs. First of all, the combat is very good. When you attack and kill things it has weight to it. You feel like you are striking your foes. But that is all that is good in this game.THE BAD:The UI is clunky and not customizable at all. You can't even see more then one action bar. You can't move UI elements to appease. These are things that should be standard in any MMO since 2003.You can't keybind more then one action bar full of actions. 1-8 is all you can assign and you have 3 classes worth of skills. This is nonsense.Loading screens everywhere! Join a dungeon, loading screen. Kill two groups of mobs, loading screen to next area. Kill a group of mobs, go to loading screen to next area. That is INSANE! More loading screens than a PSOne game.Balance. The game is way, way too easy. From what I read on the forums they nerfed enemy damage and increased EXP multiplier so that you can reach level cap really fast. So people migth think that is a good thing but to me, personally, it is not. Learning the game is half the fun. Do you really want idiots that barely know how to play in PvP and in your Guild because they reached max level cap in less than a week? There is no way they know their class.Loot at the end of the dungeon/raid is random. So it's very possible that you do a dungeon over  many, many times to get a piece of a equipment that you want. This is crazy. I had to do a dungeon 10 times before I finally got a better weapon.Cash Shop is full of ""7-day"" items. You basically pay real money for temporary items. I know it's common in most Korean MMOs but this is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. All real-money transactions should be permanantly tied to your account.Another problem is if you go on hiatus for a month they lock your account. Don't be surprised if when you come back from vacation your characters will be gone. You have to contact support and provide detailed information to get it back. This can take up to a week and by then you probably don't want to play anymore.			"

												It's like COD, except not first person, not a shooting game, doesn't have dlc, is completely free, and isn't a rehashed pile of sh*t.Being serious though, it truly is a pretty good game. Sure, the difficulty is p*ss easy until some end-game raids, and running the same dungeons over and over can get a little repetitive, but if you like mmorpgs with very flashy abilities, this is a great game. I remember reading once that the Alchemist class has an ability with so many flashing lights, it tends to crash people's computers (it then got blacklisted from many PvP tournaments). There isn't any real need to spend real money, as there are no pay-walls and the 'special' gear is mostly just cosmetics. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, but it is free-to-play, so all you're really losing is your time (which I think is well spent, as it is always fun pummeling monsters). Another really nice thing is that the story is actually really interesting. Each character has their own story line too, and my personal favorite is the Assassin one, which has to do with time travel, though I won't spoil it. My one problem with this game is that too few clothes are worn. But some people would consider that a plus.And hey, it's not under Nexon anymore. That's gotta count for something, right?			"

												Dragon Nest is a rare gem in the vast market of free to play MMOs. The game requires dedication, but if you stick with it the game can be extremely fun. The community is wonderful, and most people are willing to help. Make sure you join a guild because they will probably be more than willing to help you out. The first guild I ever joined was willing to gear me when I reached the previous level cap ( no guild I was ever a part of in Wow would do that). I am still with that guild and glad that I have stuck with them. The only real downside to the game is the time it takes for new content to come out. If nexon would keep the US servers up with the servers in SEA that would be awesome. So, in closing I would just like to state that dragon nest is one of the best MMOs you could ever play, but be prepared to spend some time and maybe a little money (only if you want to look awesome).

												Dragon Nest has me questioning why I didn't get into action MMO's sooner.The game itself has a relatively small community, but offers some awesome content and events for the players that do consistently log on. It sports some anime inspired graphics. While still giving some insanely cool and much more dark detail to most mobs and each boss at the end of every portal.Dragon Nest starts you out in a city called ""Mana Ridge"" which unfortunately seems like a cliche, because it ♥♥♥♥ing is. The game doesn't really start being eye popping until you step outside of the city and engage in your first dungeon. At that point I find you start to really appreciate the games graphical prowess and charming game mechanics. While being cliche with the story and theme, Dragon Nest really does well with its combat. It has you enter a portal into a certain area (think Guild Wars), and from that you can choose one of the varied number of ""runs"" you can take from there; you then have 5 options for which difficulty you want to run the dungeon on, easy for chumps or abyss for MEN. If I choose abyss (which the game recommends you only do in a party of 4), not only am I a badass mother ♥♥♥♥er. But I also get the advantage of better loot, and more rewards and XP at the end of the run. This part of Dragon Nest has always been my favorite thing in the game, even though the idea isn't original, and even though it literally has you do the same thing over and over.That being said, the game sucks in these categories. Well, one category. PvP. When it was released, it was the biggest cluster ♥♥♥♥ you could imagine. It promised fluid attacks, and engaging combat. What it did deliver was a trash hitbox system and incredibly out of balance classes. One lower leveled warrior could hit a stun, and just slaughter people. It drew a very distinct line between PvE and PvP oriented classes. I played it again recently on a new character and while some of the before ignored issues were resolved (The hit boxes are much much better now) It just didn't have the charisma the PvE combat had and continues to seperate and distinguish classes as PvP or PvE oriented. Especially warriors. They still stomp everybody.So, in closing. Although very cliche at a first glance, and lacking in PvP gameplay. The game does definitely offer an outstanding time for a group of friends or for somebody looking to kill some time online. If you don't mind being called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for playing anyway.nexon/10			"

												ive played this game for 4 Years and it is one hell of an rpg, commuinity is awesome players are awesome and 50/50 chance you will get help if you need it, but this game reqires dedecation i never really got the chance to talk to a dev/GM in all the time i played but i heard they are preety cool. Anyways if you are looking for an awesome rpg this is one to try out, but i must warn you, it is a pay to be able to kick ♥♥♥ in pve type of game, pay to win if you would like me to put it a better way. in this game if you want the best gear you got to be fully loaded not in cash but in gear, you have to be ready for anything the enemys throw your way and in order to increase your gear to top notch you need to spend cash so that you wont lose to the clumsy black smith who should be a pro at crafting gear . Anyways if you havent tryed this give it a try even though i wrote all of the above, give it a try it is a good game and if you like it and say to your self that you are going to dedicate your self to it, then spend cash on it ''pro tip'' leave the vanity items for last and craft your gear first. crafting your gear to 6 is free but byond that point it will break. look for the shop and buy jellys and you will be able to use that to protect your gear from breaking. oh and one last thing looks can be deciving in this game some people dont have good gear and can play very good and other look really expericed but they dont play that great so if they need help give em a hand maybe one day they will help you. teamwork is the keyin this game. 10/10 for me just wish getting jellys was much easy if you have questions about anything just send me a Message and il help you out with what i can.

												When you think about people Role Playing you probably cringe, but Dragon's Nest is a master piece where you might find yourself naturally role playing. You put yourself into your character. People become your close friends. You are extremely social and you wonder why you can't be like that in real life. Well I'm talking about myself here but maybe you can relate. Anyway, This game is like a over the shoulder dungeoning mmorpg and it's pretty fun. It's genderlocked and there's little customization as far as default goes but that's honestly not even a big deal it like doesn't bother me at all what so ever. It bothers me on other games but this game is just like so good that you over look the cons. except for one con that you can't possibly over look, and that's the fact that it's in the hands of Nexon. But whatever, only slight lag and it's not really pay to win. Furthermore PvP is pretty balanced.TL;DR 3rd person fun MMORPG play it unless you generally enjoy your ♥♥♥♥ taste.			"

												Dragon Nest is a F2P 3rd person mmorpg which has less of the button mash for auto attack and more aim your attacks instead. Dragon nest is deffinatly a fun game, but the vide dies down abit at how grindy the game gets in the later levels. Combat is deffintaly the selling point of the game, it gives you the freedom to attack and choose your targets instead of, ""CLICK THIS GUY AND SPAM SWORD SWING OR FROST BALL!!!!!!1!!11!""  and deffinatly a more refreshing point of the game.Even if the combat is usually fun, it doesn't make for the fact that the game is just outright boring after a few hours or days. Later levels are slow and grindy and usually unrewarding at the end of the day. Getting the good gear requries hours of gameplay of the same dungeon. Graphics are nothing special, they have a cartoony feel to them and is quite nice. The commuity is not bad, but you usally have to solo everything and cannot find a party no matter how hard you try. Also Because this game is made by Nexon, it almost immediatly gets points down. There are ALOT of pay items that increase your stats IMMENSLY when you buy the whole set, and gives you a edge to all the non-buyers. In the end, its a game you'll ethier love or hate, The gameplay is fun buy ultimatly unrewarding. The company behind the scenes are dodgey and usually don't help. A small 2 gigs download, Updated may take up to 2-3 g at it's current state. Graphics are undemanding and can be run on slightly weaker computers.			"

												Combat-wise, there is no competition. Dragon Nest is truly one of a kind. No other action mmo can hold a candle to DN and anywhere else you look feels like a step down. DN excels with its fluid movement, hundreds of unique skills, iframes, super-armor and third person, NON-TAB-TARGETTING style.I've been playing this game for 2 years +, and 200 hrs shown here was just during a certain two months when I was playing on steam. One of the few mmo that I can always go back to as it is updated with new content/events monthy!			"

												100% your game if you like the anime, cartoon, games. Diverse classes even though they are gender locked. The Combat style of the game is not the normal MMORPG style where you just click the target and spam ""1,1,1,2,4,6,4,7,ex"" in this game you need to look at your target, click, to do normal attacks, but still have the skill bar sort of actions, and move around to not get hit by arrows, or magic. So besides the gender and race locks, this game is amazing, and just fun, and allot of quest and dungeons to run over just when you'r bored.			"

												Dragon Nest has me questioning why I didn't get into action MMO's sooner.The game itself has a relatively small community, but offers some awesome content and events for the players that do consistently log on. It sports some anime inspired graphics. While still giving some insanely cool and much more dark detail to most mobs and each boss at the end of every portal.Dragon Nest starts you out in a city called ""Mana Ridge"" which unfortunately seems like a cliche, because it ♥♥♥♥ing is. The game doesn't really start being eye popping until you step outside of the city and engage in your first dungeon. At that point I find you start to really appreciate the games graphical prowess and charming game mechanics. While being cliche with the story and theme, Dragon Nest really does well with its combat. It has you enter a portal into a certain area (think Guild Wars), and from that you can choose one of the varied number of ""runs"" you can take from there; you then have 5 options for which difficulty you want to run the dungeon on, easy for chumps or abyss for MEN. If I choose abyss (which the game recommends you only do in a party of 4), not only am I a badass mother ♥♥♥♥er. But I also get the advantage of better loot, and more rewards and XP at the end of the run. This part of Dragon Nest has always been my favorite thing in the game, even though the idea isn't original, and even though it literally has you do the same thing over and over.That being said, the game sucks in these categories. Well, one category. PvP. When it was released, it was the biggest cluster ♥♥♥♥ you could imagine. It promised fluid attacks, and engaging combat. What it did deliver was a trash hitbox system and incredibly out of balance classes. One lower leveled warrior could hit a stun, and just slaughter people. It drew a very distinct line between PvE and PvP oriented classes. I played it again recently on a new character and while some of the before ignored issues were resolved (The hit boxes are much much better now) It just didn't have the charisma the PvE combat had and continues to seperate and distinguish classes as PvP or PvE oriented. Especially warriors. They still stomp everybody.So, in closing. Although very cliche at a first glance, and lacking in PvP gameplay. The game does definitely offer an outstanding time for a group of friends or for somebody looking to kill some time online. If you don't mind being called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for playing anyway.nexon/10			"

												ive played this game for 4 Years and it is one hell of an rpg, commuinity is awesome players are awesome and 50/50 chance you will get help if you need it, but this game reqires dedecation i never really got the chance to talk to a dev/GM in all the time i played but i heard they are preety cool. Anyways if you are looking for an awesome rpg this is one to try out, but i must warn you, it is a pay to be able to kick ♥♥♥ in pve type of game, pay to win if you would like me to put it a better way. in this game if you want the best gear you got to be fully loaded not in cash but in gear, you have to be ready for anything the enemys throw your way and in order to increase your gear to top notch you need to spend cash so that you wont lose to the clumsy black smith who should be a pro at crafting gear . Anyways if you havent tryed this give it a try even though i wrote all of the above, give it a try it is a good game and if you like it and say to your self that you are going to dedicate your self to it, then spend cash on it ''pro tip'' leave the vanity items for last and craft your gear first. crafting your gear to 6 is free but byond that point it will break. look for the shop and buy jellys and you will be able to use that to protect your gear from breaking. oh and one last thing looks can be deciving in this game some people dont have good gear and can play very good and other look really expericed but they dont play that great so if they need help give em a hand maybe one day they will help you. teamwork is the keyin this game. 10/10 for me just wish getting jellys was much easy if you have questions about anything just send me a Message and il help you out with what i can.

												wow, great game, and im just starting out. why play this game? ive tried countless mmos, and most follow the same pattern, click enemy to attack, sell your stuff, level up lame attacks, oh, and dont forget to occasionally get cool stuff, if you pay alot.this mmo offers not only a variety of classes, but very smooth transitioning between quests, as well as a good map, nice interface, and awesome graphics. my only complaints are: 1. the classes are gender based. this doesnt ruin the game one bit for me, it would just be nice if perhaps i could play a male engineer, or a female assassin, or whatever opposite gender they have2. the game can be a bit laggy in the main hub like areas, although i do play the game on a less than ideal computer, so this can also be disregarded.3. the overall choices based on character looks are suboptimal at best, with a handful of hairdoes, colors, and eyes. though no worries as youll hardly see the face anyways, and all the few hairstyles the DO offer are pretty good looking anyways.aside from these, i HIGHLY recommend the game. if your searching steam for a good rich, awesome class based mmo to download, take it from me whos downlaoded 20+ different ones and at least give this one a try. :o) "

I love this game and I recommend this game for everyone of all ages. If you're looking for a free, adventure packed online game, you've come to the right place. DN also includes character customization, awesome cutscenes, helpful NPCs, enhancing items and towns to meet up with friends... or make new ones. We can't forget Parties or Guilds, you can make those too!The designs and scenery are beautiful, and the enemies are easily beat in a team. This game is a 9/10 for me. (:			"

												Dragon Nest is a rare gem in the vast market of free to play MMOs. The game requires dedication, but if you stick with it the game can be extremely fun. The community is wonderful, and most people are willing to help. Make sure you join a guild because they will probably be more than willing to help you out. The first guild I ever joined was willing to gear me when I reached the previous level cap ( no guild I was ever a part of in Wow would do that). I am still with that guild and glad that I have stuck with them. The only real downside to the game is the time it takes for new content to come out. If nexon would keep the US servers up with the servers in SEA that would be awesome. So, in closing I would just like to state that dragon nest is one of the best MMOs you could ever play, but be prepared to spend some time and maybe a little money (only if you want to look awesome).

The economy is luckily much more stable than vindictus and it doesn't cost you a fortune to get good gear and enhancments(like vindictus again). Oh and the blacksmith isn't a ♥♥♥♥ (like vindictus).

												DN has gone way downhill as support for the game has weakened...- Aside from the smooth satisfying combat (when your not lagging) the game is lacking in content and quite boring.- Has repetitive holiday events and offers very little innovation into its genre. - Guild support is bare-bones and quite pointless/unnecessary. - DN is VERY punishing to new players that don't have friends to hold their hand upon arriving at max level. - Promotes PTW.- Very poor servers, making PvP feel like its a joke and PvE feel unfair at times (but not as often).  - Majority of the community is quite bad at the game (my opinion), making it hard for them to get with parties so they can improve. (unless they have a friend/guild willing to hold  their hand) - NO BENEFITS for helping new players. No worthwhile rewards are guaranteed to helping new players/doing old content (this WAS shown in the form of the ""fledgling bonus"" which gave extra drops to a players first time doing a nest, it was removed)2.5/10tl;drAmazing combat Pathetic overall execution/innovationBad communityLaughable serversVery punishing to new players-This could change with T5 but as of now not worth the time.

												I'd recommend this game to you if it was still 2012.This game has turned to ♥♥♥♥ to be completely honest - and it has done so in almost every aspect thinkable. The story is boringly repetetive and cliche, the servers lag in most countries so you will teleport back and forth and not be able to hit anything, the community is pretty much non-existant and the people left are max level so they'll ignore you, the devs changed the difficulty system so you may now only play the early levels on the easiest settings, and worst of all: the game is far too easy.It seems to have the opposite problem to most mmos, in that it's not 'grindy' or difficult, it's just running through every dungeon and killing everything a few times and then moving onto the next dungeon (It is grindy in that aspect). It feels more like a poorly made and boringly long singleplayer game that still has the lag issues of being a f2p asian mmo. Playing this is just like waiting for the ending to come, and if a game has that quality, then just go back to real life since it's the same ♥♥♥♥, but with characters that actually matter.The only way I recommend this game is if you bring together a bunch of friends and play through it in short bursts as a party whilst not taking it too seriously. In 2012/13 you could have done this with players you met in game, but now the only community left are at max level as stated.Base Game: 7/10What You Get: 4/10			"

You may have to keep clicking the confirm button from your Email repeatedly until it actually decides to confirm your Email.  Had to chase this little nugget of information down to get to the next glitch.Second issue:  The disappearing cursor...Apparently the ""workaround"" is to lower your display size below 150% so that your mouse cursor will show once the game launches....Not sure if it worked because the game locked up my PC when I tried to log in that time...You may not have any issues depending on your set up...no idea.  Im running a laptop with a 4k monitor which may have had something to do with the cursor issue...So be warned you may have to use some finesse to even start playing this game.

												I tried this game a few years back because it was cute and challenging. The skillbased attack and dodge system meant you could challenge much stronger enemies if you paid attention, giving you a shot as only slightly better gear. All around it was fun and didn't require a large time commitment. I really liked the boss battles, where they had a ton of HP, an interesting ability rotation and the ability to spawn minions at certain points.Now it is terribly boring. They give you so many over powered costume and item sets for advancing through the starting levels that you blow up everything in your path. Bosses get one-shoted! I like my costume. I look cool and the costume buffs you up. Now I no longer have any incentive to collect other items. You also gain XP so quickly that all the quests I can access are no longer a challenge and I don't see a way to move to a tougher area. This game is totally unbalanced and from what I have heard has no end game.It has wonderful art direction and I really would like to enjoy it. I tried a naked run to see if that would make things fun again. I still destroyed everything. The bosses lasted for almost a minute. It just makes me sad.			"

Dragon Nest is a fast paced, hack-and-slash MMORPG. I enjoy the many classes and advancements in Dragon Nest, such as the Warrior, Cleric, or Assassin! Obviously there's more than those three. Dragon Nest is almost revolutionary due to having a different fighting style, not just point and click.Overall: I'd give it a 6.8/10. There is so much to the game already, but there can be more that could be improved.Controls & Handling: 8/10. The controls are easy to learn, but it ranges from class to class. The Warrior is immensely faster than any other class due to unlocking the dash ability at level 10.Graphics: 5/10. The graphics are subpar compared to other games such as Aion: Ascension or Guild Wars 2, but it gets the job done. The main point of Dragon Nest is definitely not graphicsStoryline: 8/10. The storyline is centered around your specific class saving the world, which is kind of stereotypical, but once you get into the game, it goes into the lore. Such as the  aging difference of archers/elves or how the Cleric becomes high priest of an organization. Really tedious to start, but great to read through once you've gotten interested.Music: 6/10. The music kind of just... fits. Although, during dungeons it can be quiet until you start attacking an enemy, but once the music gets going, you really get hyped for battle and it makes you have a sense of urgency.			"

												Nexon has developed a reputation for releasing games that, while great on a gameplay level, are filled with microtransactions and alterations to the game to force you to buy them. While Dragon Nest continues this legacy to a degree, it's not as bad as other games the company has put out. From a gameplay standpoint Dragon Nest is very fun with its combo-based combat. The six classes (as of this review) are all fun to play in their own ways, and the specializations they can take let them further define their styles in unique ways. While the early levels can be a bit of a slog, once you get to around level 30 the game really opens up in terms of the skills you get. And whether your fighting alone, with a friend, or against a friend the combat is always enjoyable.It's unfortunate then that the rest of the game around it is a little shallow. Quests are your standard affair, either go here and kill this or go here and collect this. A few quests spice things up in interesting ways such as giving you an overpowered NPC helper or giving you a unique enemy to fight, but such quests are few and far between. Thankfully if fighting AI monsters gets boring you can always fight your fellow man in PvP. PvP is fairly balanced (with a few exceptions) with an emphasis on personal skill rather than your gear and stats.This brings me to the much despised part of any Nexon game, the cash shop. While games like Mabinogi and Maplestory are pretty much pay-to-win when it comes to their cash shop, Dragon Nest really doesn't feel that way. Sure the costumes give nice stat boosts and there are items that protect your gear from breaking while enhancing them, but such things aren't necessary unless your absolutely serious about min-maxing. Even then you should be fine as long as you invest in a decent skill build and have practiced enough to use your skills to their fullest. You even get a special level up reward box that gives out certain cash shop items like storage and inventory space, meaning you don't have to spend a dime so long as your patient.I have a feeling alot of people have/will blow this game off just because Nexon is publishing it, which is a shame. While it has its flaws Dragon Nest is a pretty decent action game if you put some time in it. It might not be the best game ever but it certainly is leagues above some of Nexon's other games. I advise you to give it a try and at least play up till level 30 or so before you pass your final judgement on the game.			"

												This is a game with similar gameplay to other action mmos such as Vindictus, C9, etc. At first I was skeptical of this game but it actually provides a decent amount of fun. I took the time to try out different classes to see how they were and I can say each class seems worth playing, never did I feel like any class was downright boring, useless or underpowered. You do normal attacks using the left mouse button and special attacks, which are usually kicks, with the right mouse button. One thing I didn't quite like was the fact that your skills are all placed on hotkeys, which imo, defeats the purpose of this game being an action mmo. The graphics are childlike in appearance and remind me a lot of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series though it's a little disturbing how this game is with certain female characters and also ""panty shots"".When you create a character, you get a choice between 3 or 4 different hairstyles and clothing options, giving this game very minimal appearance customization. Overall this game seems good for what it is but I can't recommend it over Vindictus though for people who don't care for Vindictus, you could certainly do worse than this game.			"

												It's pretty much a World of Warcraft C9/Vindictus graphics wise. C9 and Vindictus are dead, Dragon Nest is still very much alive. The combos aren't nearly as good as C9, which makes it very newbie friendly, but at the same time the Raids are much more difficult, catering to the hardcore players. If you give this game a shot, at least play until level 24, when you get the fun skills. When I first tried it out I dismissed it at level 12 or so because it was generic, but obviously I just didn't have any of the good skills by then. They really did a good job distributing buffs and debuffs throughout the classes, every raid contains no multiples, and the ones that do only have one or two, making most classes desirable. As for p2win, you can get virtually everything by grinding, which may take a bit, but it's certainly not as p2win as most other F2P titles. The only major downside is the gender locked classes, the tinkerer looks like she's an 8 year old girl... But if you can see past that, it's most definitely one of the best games out there.			"

												Dragon Nest is not a normal MMORPG, it is one of the best rpg's I've ever played it doesn't use cheap auto attacking it has a real hack n' slash system in the game.  It takes skill to play this you need to be ready to dodge strike critical strike and power strike.  The graphics are very nice and the bloom is very fitting.  The game has multiple characters that may be gender locked but it's still very fun to play.  It has an actual story with real cutscenes and voice acting and I find the story very interesting to follow.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a nice new fresh experience in rpgs.  The game does a great job of making you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ at a low level and you just feel so awesome when you take on giant bosses all by yourself I just love it!

												Dragon Nest is, in my opinion, an incredible game. I can't really think of anything I don't like about it, although I'm sure there's a few flaws in it, they're certainly not significant at all. The art is genuinely pleasing for an anime-style game, there's a pretty good choice of classes, with my only complaint being that they are genderlocked, but I haven't really found that to be much of a problem, personally. I like all of the dungeons and how they all have their own theme and the different difficulties are definitely a nice bonus. I find that it is also quite possible to be good at the game without spending money on it, and the Dragon Vault gives good options for character customization by allowing different durations for the equipment items, along with stats on most of them. I find Dragon Nest to be an all around amazing game, currently my favorite, and I would definitely recommend it. :)			"

												Dragon Nest's combat system made me realize that i probably could never play another MMO that didnt have a similiar feel to it. You dont see a move go right through a monster or player and see a -MISS- icon. The only way to miss is to have bad aim.Be prepared to devote your life to this game, and be willing to give up your soul.EDITI guess i should be a little more precise.PROS:Combat System: COMPLETELY INCREDIBLE. This is a 4/5 year old game, and that fact there are no target locks, and no other game that i can think of with a combat system that also DOES NOT USE target locks, makes this game stand out way above the others. If you miss, its just bad aiming, or the inevitable lag.Story Line: Ive only played one class completely to the current level cap storyline (80 atm), and i absolutely love it. People say that MMO storylines arent the greatest, and i understand that having played few other MMOs as well, but i have to say DN has a amazing storyline (For Kali class anyways, havent branched out into other classes as much.)Leveling: This is not a grind-cringing spending months to hit level cap. In fact, just recently they LOWERED the needed exp needed to level up per level. If you no-lifed 4 days, im pretty sure you could be level cap, or really close.Content: The amount of content in game is enourmous, albeit alot of it are lower cap level nests and such. But the game doesnt totatlly abandon, having weekly nests to have a chance of getting level cap equipment to gear up. But the thing that kept me playing for 6000+ hours was the raids. Finding a dedicated group of 7 other people, to learn, and defeat the dragons every level cap, and finally doing it for the first time. That'll never get old.Communtiy: Ive met alot of nice, friendly, funny people in this game. There are alot of people in here that are willing to help you, whether through tips or finding someone to leech out of (dont leech please), to make youre experience be a good one, and helping you learn about your class. I spent so much time in game, in chat systems talking to these people, theyre family to me. More so than my real life friends.CONS:Communtiy: The saltiest people are in this game. I swear they eat a bag of salt before they start playing everyday, thats how salty there are. But ofcourse, every community has those right? Dont be suprised to meet one. Want some help running level cap nest? If you join a party and you dont have decent gear, -permakicked from party-. But they did add diffilcutly levels to nest, so i guess it balances out..... to a point... Latency: THIS IS THE SINGLE THING KILLING THIS GAME (Well nexon in general). DDOS on MapleStory AFFECTS DRAGON NEST BECAUSE WE RUN ON THE SAME SERVER. Why? Cant they afford dedicated servers for Dragon Nest? Im pretty sure they can from the $$$$ people spend in this game for cash shop items. Lag is so bad, it affects pvp, character skills going off when youre juggling them, getting hit by stomp mechs WHILE IN THE AIR, and just bad lag in general. I know there will always be lag, but when people start mass dcing from the world, then yea, im pretty sure its not our bad comps. Also PVP is a terrible mess. A beautiful, stunnin, bright, and at times, VERY VERY LAGGY MESS. But i digress...Randon Number Generator(Cash Shop, Enhancing, Etc): Alot of beautiful costumes, pets, wings etc. Too bad the Random Number Generator is terrible. Want the newest wings? Buy a 30 egg pack, worth $29.90, and hope that RNGods are with you. Ive seen people spend THOUSANDS trying to get things in those eggs, myself included, and to be dissapointed in my bad luck. Want to enhance a Legendary Grade weapon to +12? Good luck grinding for the gold, to just see it gone in 1 try, that probably wont succeed anyways. With so much people spending money on this game, they should atleast compensate those who spend past a certain limit. i mean, to spend a months paycheck in one go... and to get nothing in return... yea thats definetly not worth it.CONCLUSIONWould i recommend this game? Hell yeah, this is a awesome game, with not that bad graphics, and a incredible story line and combat system. Find the right people in game, find the right group to do stuff with, and to find a right guild to be a part of, then this game will be very enjoyable. Dont try to be a leecher, cause many people WILL ignore you, or avoid replying to you. Plan on spending on this game? Your choice, i gave you my outlook of the cash shop, but i guess if youre lucky, it wont be so bad. But ive seen so many unlucky people. But one word of advice, if youre still trying out the game, make a decision whether youre not youre planning on playing for the long term. In any game really, you should debate if youre going to or not. Would be a waste to spend $$$ just to quit a month later.			"

												Dragon Nest is like your classic RPG. You do quests and level up, yada yada ya. However, unlike games such as Mabinogi or WoW, the combat system embraces fluidity of skills. It's not turn-based and moves can be used whenever they're available during dungeons. The skill point system can be tailored to one's playstyle. It's quite enjoyable to play with friends, but playing in public parties is tolerable. The currency is easily gained and lost through progression and you don't need to spend money to access moves or slots for moves *cough* Spiral Knights *cough*. The NX cash shop, or the Dragon Vault, presents a variety of items such as costumes, which you don't really need to succeed, or functional consumables which the game gives you for free. The game's content is ever-expanding in the storyline and a lot of effort is put into it (even if most of you probably click as fast as you can through quests without reading). There aren't a multitude of downsides that can't be solved by the player themselves, but first and foremost: Dragon Nest is licensed (?) through Nexon. Their customer support is horrid. The couple of weeks before December had a lot of problems with connection, disconnection, and overall lag. However, the compensation for issues is usually worth it. Another problem is that single-player play can get monotonous because like many RPGs, the game is grindy, but that can either be remedied by playing in a party or y'know, taking a break. The community is riddled with individuals of almost all ages, ranging from the stereotypical whiny, slightly-illiterate ""twelve-year old"", to people who are married and have kids. One last drawback is that to run certain dungeons (nests), public parties usually require players to already be geared upon joining, however many guilds and other players are nice enough to help individuals who are new to levels and the game overall.edit: elaborated monotony			"

Forced closed it, and tried again. This time I got to character selection/creation, hit create character, then to a black screen again. 4th,5th, and final time trying, I got disconnected from server message when logging in then the game closed. I highly do not suggest this game to anyone as you cannot even get through the menu's without the game crashing or bugging out. I can only imagine how buggy the game play is.			"

												First off, you more likely to enjoy this game if you enjoy anime and manga (Japanese Media), since the chracters and art is stylized in that direction. I wouldn't say that all people who enjoy anime would enjoy this game, its just a common trend I've seen in players. Things that I've been Impressed in this game:STORY: As a F2P game, its got cut scenes and great voice acting for many of the characters. If invest the time, you can find a variety of amusing and deep storyline in the game.USER FREINDLY: Well, its a typical Fantasy Rpg, with skills binded to action hot keys. The Games Dugeon to Dugeon action makes playing the game simple and user freindly.  Death dosn't have a major penalty and PVP play is available in specificl chanaels.RE-PLAYABILITY: This game encourages replay ability, if gives you XP buffs to your characters though the Unified Skill system, you have Server (cross character) storage as well as a mailing system to send stuff back and forth between characters. And since theres multiple characters with multiple prestige classes, theres plenty of variety in game play styles.If you haven't played a Nexon Game yet, you shoudl definitely give this game of Vindictus a try.

												Really fun game to play with friends.  Still pretty fun to play alone, but you miss out on alot of good content if you don't play with others.I really enjoy how often they add to the game with extra content, items, pets, mounts, nest, and level caps.One of the best things about this game is the story line....I normally skip dialog in games like these, but it quickly caught my eye in the very first town you start in.  The NPCs are wonderful in this game xD "

												I don't like MMO's, and I don't like F2P. I like this game anyway. For some reason it doesn't manage pull the same ♥♥♥♥♥ that pisses me off in games such as WOW or EVE, while maintaining the same basic ideas. It has the fetchquests, it has the GRIND, it has the cash store for useless items...But its fun, which both WOW and EVE fail at on a horrific level. If you've never played an MMO, this is a good place to start. It even manages to scale nicely with dual AMD cards, which is something quite a few newer games fail to manage.			"

												It is not a game I personally enjoy but it is not a bad game. The graphics are a bit lower compared to the newer games because of how long ago dragon next was made.

												I would normally recommend this game, but for as little gameplay I have achieved, it is not frickin worth it.I originally downloaded this game so my sister and I could play together, but that could not be achieved. EVERY SINGLE TIME I WENT INTO A DUNGEON WITH HER, IT WOULD DISCONNECT ME. If I stood in the town too long, it would disconnect me too. it would disconnect me if I went hard mode on dungeons. A lot of the time it would just fail to load up. 90% of all the time I played the game was just trying to get THE STUPID THING TO WORK. When I did get to play, it was by myself but the gameplay was good. So if you have a computer that is good and CONSTANTLY doesn't disconnect you from games, I suggest you try it.			"

												Game is actually pretty good for being free to play.  But if you're like most people with a job, you'll end up spending hundreds of dollars, if not thousands of dollars, into this game.  Note that money spent mostly cosmetic.  I used to have one of each class maxed and fully geared.  I was also #1 and #3 in PvP ranking in the server I was in, and was a leader of moderately successful PvE guild.  I played this game for over a year and it was fun at the time, and the raids are done well.  But the main thing about this game is that it lacks content.  Whatever they do have is pretty good, but the fact that you're forced to grind same thing over and over and over and over, just isn't very entertaining.  I may have recommended this game in the beginning, but soon you will see why I can't recommend this game. "

												Ok, I'm going to have to preface my review of this game with saying that I do not have at the time of this review, a character at the level 70 level cap. I plan to do so though.As with all of my other reviews, they will be scaled from 0 to 10 on a few criteria.Gameplay: 7.5/10: This game would get a perfect 10, if a few things were reduced/removed. A. GRINDING, Be prepared to grind your ♥♥♥ off in this game. When the game's level cap was 50, it took me several MONTHS to hit 50 on my non-boosted toon. B. Gear Upgrading, Ok, so in this game like classic Nexon fasion there is a gear upgrading ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t system. You have to spend real money to get anywhere near past about +10 on your gear, though some people are generous enough to post the jellies on the Auction House, for ♥♥♥♥TONS of Gold... These are the only things really hampering the gameplay. Otherwise, it's very fun, action based MMORPG with alot of flashy skills.Graphics: 9/10: This game would again get a perfect 10, if 1 thing was tweaked. visual effects of the Tinkerer class.

 watch that video if you want an explination (a very funny one)Audio: Japan/Korean Voices: 10/10: American Voices: 8/10:  There used to be a mod for the game that added in the Korean voice actors for all of the classes, but it didnt continue after about Kali got released, If I could read Korean, I would be playing KDN because the voices are like 3000x better in that game. The american ones are just a bit too cheezy at some times, though some lines are funny. also, Shield Charge in KDN is one of my favorite lines along with the American version of Justice Crash.Overall: 8.5 out of 10. I'm actually going to agree with IGN on this one, it's a good place to dip your toes into the F2P genera of games, and a good place to stick. PvP is fun, PvE isnt that bad, just alot of grinding. If there was a Maybe button for the Do you recommend this game, I would probably hit that one, but Yes will be good enough.Edit: This game is now in the hands of the Parent Company/Original Creators EyeDentity! So, updates will most likely come sooner, and the general quality of the game will improve!			"

												So far, I love this game! The classes are all quite unique both in skills and in personality, with each class having their own specializations that change up their playstyles even further. The community, as I've experienced it, has been mostly nice, though you shouldn't expect people to be always there to party up for something. Dungeons, which are your main way of leveling up alongside quests, can get repetetive since there are only around ~3-4 in each area, with each one having ~4-5 different areas inside. Quests, if you actually read into them instead of spamming the space bar to skip the dialogue, generally have a great amount of personality to them, with many, many puns and jokes and such involved in many! Overall, I'd recommend playing this game with friends since it enhances just about everything you do.			"

												Dragon Nest is Asian made action targeting MMORPG that is free to play.Cons: -The classes are gender locked and no customization.  -The avatar artwork is asian style munchkins.-The graphics are outdated.Personally, i was Not impressed with the game enough to play more.  Need to get back to playing my games that i have paid for like LOTRO, STO, DDO, and SWTOR.  I am sure someone might like this game, give it a try.Play Style/Game Playfull control of the players movement using the keys ""W, A, S, D"".  Skills using the short cut keys ""1-10"".  Dragon nest consists of 2 game modes or 2 of both, PvP and PvE. You start off as PvE but later through the levels you can change to PvP or do both. The game consists of 8 Characters as Classes of which they have their own unique skills and abilities. Classes have 'specialization' where they can change into their first and second job and focus on that particular area of combat. Specialization are granted at level 15 and level 44. The 8 classes include:WarriorArcherClericSorceress TinkererKaliAssassinLancerFor more information of the classes and what specialisations they have go to the Nexon website @ http://dragonnest.nexon.net/guides/class-guide  for more info:

												This hit hit the spot four years ago when I was looking for a non targeting action brawler with an archer class.. Recently trying new games that might be like it and ended up getting back into this again.  It's a great game and I've only really gotten about half way through the story and the side quests are endless.  As for people complaining it's too easy and you level up too quick, you can be a level 93 and still have lower level gear to make lower level missions more difficult.  Kind of a dumb complaint.  Honestly great game for free and it can totally be played at your own pace, leveling and crafting gear can be addicting so it's tough to have self control if you want to play levels with level appropriate gear..  This is probably one of the first games I reviewed so It's really good imo.			"

But again this game is so fun that a just sorta look over it. The skills look so amazing. The cosmetics look ♥♥♥♥ing great. There are so many things good with this game. It is heavly instanced and it is very annoying to lvl. I dont really remember my first time playing this game. Because when you get your first or second max lvl.

												This is a fun game, its made by the same company who published Vindictus, the graphics are great, the battle system is good, each class has one thing or person they have to protect or save.  But you can choose from 4 classes, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. So if you want a fun MMORPG, you should download this game and try it. Character design is pretty cool, the enemies can be a tad bit difficult, but hey what do you expect? for the enemies to stay at an easy level? lol, whats the fun in that , seriously.... But all in all you shoudl try this game, if you like MMORPG's. The only thing i dont like about this, well is that its llike Vindictus, meaning that you cant really free roam in this game, but oh well. Its a very good game if you like the MMORPG style like Vindictus, its very fun, and you can lose countless hours in it and not even realising it			"

												Very Fast paced 3D game. I love it sooo much because of all of the skills you get and all of the epic combos. Each class has their own unique gameplay style. You can forge equipment from Items you get from Bosses. You may think that The game is a little slow but play until level 32 then the whole world opens out to you.			"

												I actually like this game. It reminds me of Cube World which is one of my favorite games. I like the free roam fighting style and the feel of the  character moving around and evading attacks. Also, the game dosen't look that bad. It runs perfectly fine on my computer and looks pretty decent. Overall a grat game for being free. My only problem is that the characters are gender locked and that the weapons and the armor don't look that different as you progress. I'm not sure how different the armor looks as you get to the higher tiers of levels, but at the moment, they all seem to look the same.			"

												Dragons Nest is an MMORPG game, and a pretty interesting one I find. The game isn't turn based, its actually real time, which is cool, its played from a kind of MMO view, but in a way plays sort of like Diablo. It has many different Dungeons that you go into to complete quests, and each Dungeon has a boss. There are also 6 classes, and each are pretty unique. And have some pretty cool flashy abilities, as well as 2 subclasses for each.The story I don't find to be super compelling, but its decent I guess. The graphics are a cartoonish style, which is fine and works for me really. Unless your not a fan of cartoon style it shouldn't bother you.One thing I kind of dislike about the game is the lack of customization, you can't even change your gender, each class is set to a specific gender, which is kind of disappointing as I really like customization on characters. There is very little of that in this game however. But it doesn't make the game bad or anything.The dungeons are kind of easy at first, but get pretty tough pretty steadily, before long you won't be able to do every dungeon on master difficulty with ease, and you will need to turn the difficulty lower, or get a few friends to help.Each time you enter a Dungeon you can select a difficulty, which affects how much XP you get and other rewards. And the dungeons can get challanging like I said, even if the first couple aren't especially with friends. But overall the game is pretty fun I find, especially with a buddy or two. Its a fresh nice MMO which I find enjoyable as you bash through tons of enemies alone or with your friends. And aquire juicy loot and cool spells.And the fact its free means I think you should atleast try it if you get the chance.			"

												I highly recommend this game but DO NOT download the STEAM VERSION. Go to Nexon's official website at http://dragonnest.nexon.net/ and download their client instead. The steam version is regularly plagued by log-in and patching issues and the only fix is to re-download the game every single time. Nexon and Steam doesn't seem to care about this version anymore.Now, on to the review! If you want action-oriented MMORPG with flashy / cool-looking moves then Dragon Nest is the game for you. You have your basic rpg classes in the form of Warrior, Archer, Cleric and Sorcerer. The other available classes are Tinkerer (a sort of engineer) and Dancer. Upcoming classes are Assassin and Lancer.The world is instance type wherein areas (including towns) are separated like dungeons. Although, the towns are very big themselves. The dungeons get bigger and bigger as you progress into the game. Lastly, the environment details are well made and numerous.You gain exp in the game by killing mobs in dungeons, clearing the dungeons themselves and completing NPC quests. When you gain a level you get skill points which you can use to unlock your skills. Core stats are pre-set by the game. Pretty much a standard level and skill system. There's a nifty feature wherein you can see a demo of a skill first before you get it. That way, you can see if you'll like the skill or not.Exp is very fast from Level 1 to 50. 50 to 70 is when the grind starts but still doable and not boring because of the awesome combat system. If you're a hardcore player that can sit a whole day in front of a computer then you can get to the level cap in a week or so. If you're a casual player like me, at level 50 onwards you can gain 2 levels a day or 4 while still being able to stand up and do other stuff. That's pretty fast by today's MMORPG standards.I won't go into the other details of the game because to be honest, it's very big even though it's instanced type. I just provided feedback on the basic features that players tend to look forward to.So again, if you're into action and flashy moves, this is the game for you. You're not really missing anything by not dowloading the Steam version so go the Nexon website I provided on this review and get their client instead. Trust me, it'll be less hassle in the long run.Nexon Dragon Nest Official Website:http://dragonnest.nexon.net/ "

												I've recently gone over my review and noticed it was... rather plain, and didn't give any indication as to the actualy quality of this game, so allow me to elaborate. Dragon Nest is an Action RPG made by Nexon and, what I would call, like Vindictus' younger brother. The combat is very involved as compared to other MMORPG's and skills are very satisfying to use. All-in-all, I would say Dragon Nest is a very fun MMORPG and if you like Vindictus, you will most likely enjoy this game.Pros:- Cutesy Anime Style (Maybe a con if you're not into that?)- Runs fairly well- Satisfying/Solid Combat- Straight-forward and easy to understand- Not Pay-to-win (Last I checked anyway...)- Has the general quality one can expect from a Nexon game- Panty ShotsCons:- Progress slows down rather significantly around level 40 (Cap is like 80, I think?)- Difficult to gear-up later on- PvP is incredibly brokenThe bottom line is, I haven't really had any bad experiences with Dragon Nest, and it's F2P, so why not give it a try?

I know there's still a bit of that but there's a bit more of movement in there like the special attacks and jumping and rolling to dodge. I like that freedom of movement. Maybe a bit more freedom on the character customization too would be nice as well.			"

												I highly recommend that you should give this game a solid try if you haven't already. By solid try, I mean to level a character past 15 and the first specialization because, as other reviews may have noted, it's a bit of a slow starter. Your character starts off fairly weak with few impressive skills. However, that just makes the payoff that much more satisfying later when you decimate about thirty goblins in a single blow. With very few exceptions, most of the skills in this game are AoEs with no upper limit of affected targets and no reduced damage for the number of targets affected. This lends to an almost addictive feeling of raw, unadulterated power.But let's focus on what I really like about this game.This game just oozes charm. Though the graphics are not what one would expect from a top-of-the-line blockbuster, the animations are fluid to the point that one can suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in the world of Altera. This is further supplemented by the voice acting. Although I'm not a huge fan of the voice acting for the playable characters themselves, and voice acting in the cutscenes is to be expected, I've sort of fallen in love with how the NPCs are voiced. It's nothing too elaborate; each NPC has a couple of different canned lines for when you initiate a conversation with them, and a couple for when you part ways. However, they really help to bring the setting to life, especially in tandem with the humorous and well-written dialogue for the quests themselves. I often found myself re-reading the quest dialogues for quests I'd done a dozen times already, simply because I found them that funny. The story itself has plenty of twists and turns, and I always found myself wanting to charge down the main quest line just to know what happened next.I'm also a big fan of the game's mechanics. I've played games which implemented the public-instanced-town with privately-instanced-dungeons mechanic, and games which implemented the third-person shooter perspective. This one does both, and fairly well. I'm generally a fan of soloing the majority of game content, and the regular dungeons are solo-friendly. Combat is smooth, interweaving regular mouse-button attacks with hotkeyed skills so that one is rarely just spamming skills and waiting for cooldowns to reset. Gear is relatively easy to come by (though less so with the more classes added, sadly)(EDIT: They fixed that issue, as gear drops in boxes that give you a class-specific item when you open them.), as soloing Master difficulty is fairly easy and one can get ""magic"" green-quality gear from Master instances. Upgrading ""magic"" gear to +6 (+7 or more if you find extras that you can competitively upgrade until one breaks) is pretty darn cheap and gives you more than enough stats to get you through soloing abyss dungeons on pretty much any class, so I would recommend not bothering with blue or orange gear until you're near endgame and really need the stats for harder dungeons, Nests, and PvP.There are limitations, of course. The classes are gender-locked, and though you can customize your character's appearance to an extent, each of them is essentially their own pre-made character with its own story. It may also be difficult for a newer player/character to find others to level with, but joining a guild (or even just staying in the newbie guild you're automatically inserted into when your character is made) may remedy this issue.All in all, I've put a lot of hours into this game and always find myself coming out for more. Maybe it's not your thing, but I'd recommend giving it a try, anyway.			"

												Overall it's a nice little action RPG reminds me a lot of Phantasy Star Online (DN is waaay heavier on the action though), but with a midevil twist to it, simple and fun you complex all at the same time, with tons of missions to do and tons of people to meet.  It's been out for a few years but if you get into a nice guild the fun can really start, especially once you start forming friendships.  Only other action RPG i like better than this one is Blade and Soul and I WISH that would be a steam game if NCSOFT didn't create it. But i HIGHLY recommend Dragon Nest.			"

I play with my best friend and we have fun clearing the dungeons on the harder difficulties. I love experimenting with each class. (can't wait for the assassin!) I also enjoy the contrast between the character looks and the monster looks. It goes from ""oh, that's nice."" to ""Oh GOD oh, what the hell IS that thing... THAT'S AN ORC??!! I've never seen an orc like that before. Who designed these monstrosities??!! WTF is goin on????"" I love every bit of this game and I'll spend endless hours playing it in the future. Take note NOT to be discourged because of the gender-locked classes. they're fun none the less and you'll get used to them! I highly recommend this Korean Action MMORPG, to any fan of fast paced combate and unique anime-like graphics.			"

												I haven't been playing long so if you need to decide if you are going to get this game, look to a review from someone who has spent at least 30 hrs in game.I am here to share my first impressions. I'll start with the bad: the game is very cookie cutter, story line, level grind, being usless untill level 20, and so on. I have also seen better graphics, WAY BETTER. The game also feels frustratingly easy, but takes a long  time. It's like every other F2P MMO out there. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!Now for the good stuff; the game is adorable, the npc's have funny personalities, It's quick to understand, and really fun, almost relaxing. But what is really unique about this game is the community. I was playing for the first time trying to figure out what to do and bam, in the first FIVE minutes I met three people (all higher level than me) just hanging around, who invited me to their party. Two minutes later they where going on all my quests with me and showing me what to do. They helped me until I reached lvl 10 when I had to get off and catch some sleep. We have keept in touch since then but it's really cool how I met them so soon and how friendly they where, I'm used to playing games where nearly everyone is ""lone wolf"" kinda thing but It's really nice to have people to party up with and just hang out.I'm keeping this short and sweet so overall first impression is: I'm No longer forever alone.

												Dragon Nest is and MMO RPG based game set in an great looking world this game delivers alot of action alot of quest and you can have various things to do their is always a guild to join and their is always someone to play with. I have tried running this game on ultra and it looks very good when playing this game I recommend you try running it on normal and up. Also their is a market place system on here so check that out when you get over 1K gold. From a scale on 1-10 I would give this game a 7/10.Dragon Nest may have it's moments such as having lag at some points or your screen may go black from time to time.I recommend this game for people that want to play a cartoon based MMO it is very fun and can be a bit addictive but most of all it's about teaming up and kicking ♥♥♥. The animation in this game is down right and good I love how the senes come up and when their over their's even more action and fighting missions in this game take a while to complete and every year they add up the level max by 10. I am currently a level 56 but the level cap is now 70. In this game you can really play for a very long time and not get board. I think what makes this MMO diffrent from others is the charcters and how they look.+Warrior+Archer+Cleric+KaliAre my top 4 favorite charcters I recommend these guys because they really get the job done they kill Swift and Clean and they are really easy to control. during the begining of the game you are introduced to a wonderful world each character has a diffrent cutsene inn the start of the game. But they all really come together and you won't really realize it. I recommend that you team up with other people at least 2 or 3 but a party of 4 is also good too. When playing Dragon Nest it is always good for your party's characters to be diffrent. Their is no fun in having a party of 4 and all of you guys are warriors. Every character is diffrent and they all have their own special abilities so make a wise choice. When starting out you will be a bit confused so help is always needed your can ask people to train you but they might want you to be a certain level before they begin to help you out. Having a Mentor is always good because they can power level you when you need them the most. Weapons and Armor in this game are really good. The equipment you start out with is ind of crappy but as you progress in this game you will unlock some really good stuff. If you want to get a bit fancy with your Weapons and Armor you can buy soome NX in the game and get and outfits,pets,weapons, and other accesories. This game is really good you should really try it out you will learn how to play right away the customization on here is great and the graphics are really good so check it out and good luck on your travels. Dragon Nest delivers a great set of music when  you are in town and when you are in battle. The bosses in this game can be difficult if you don't know what your doing I give this game a 7/10			"

												A very diverse game with a very smooth feel. The controls make you feel like you are in control of it all. The graphics aren't the greatest in the world, but the motion capture is very smooth to make up for that. The storylines are very unique and complete. The way you level is easier than most games. The end of the class trees are at level 45, unlike the level 70 that most other games have. You don't get bored while playing this game. You have to be alert to what is happening and be a step ahead of everyone else.			"

												This game is not the prettiest, but what it lacks in graphics it makes up for in combat design. The game is 100% action RPG.Level, quest, and gear progression, however, can feel a bit slow as the game sets up barriers to compel you to invest your money in things like fashionable armor pieces and in game currency. This game is good for those who want graphically low-end game with high-end game play.			"

												Generally I'm not into MMOs because I don't find them engaging. The whole ""point at enemy, push button"" aspect is not appealing to me. However, this MMO is different from what I'm used to seeing from them. This one uses a hack and slash mechanic and is quite fun! I actually can't wait to get my next skill, instead of being generally confused when I learn a new one in other MMOs. This games is generally geared for a younger audience, so there's not much to it intellectually, but the characters and quests are charming and at times extremely funny. The whole game has a generic anime feel to it, but if you like good, clean fun in a pretty environment you can't go wrong here.			"

												This game is a fun and challenging action MMO set up with a fast-paced dungeon crawling experiance and a great social community. The camera is third person so you always feel like your in the action, with movement being in the WASD, The free to play system is fair and does NOT really affect balance between players, i.e. pay to win situation. Most of your money goes into cosmetics anywa. Plus the game runs, and looks great! I do recommend that you play with friends and take on harder, but more rewarding challenges. A lot of fun is to be had with friends. The only thing that may be discouraging is that you can't choose the specific sex you want to play as for each class. So if you want to be a female, warrior-brute, sorry :/  I didn't have any big gripes with that though. I would say go in, pick your play style, and have fun!			"

												To preface about myself, I've been playing this game since beta, and have well over 500 hours logged on this, since the switch to using Steam for Dragon Nest was relatively recent.I have a great time playing this game. It recently got revamped to make leveling from 1-50 easier, although it will still take time. It's definitely possible to finish the story line with just the gear you get from quests, although getting really good gear will definitely take time and in-game currency. While there are people who trade NX for gold and vice versa, this game is most definitely not pay 2 win, but there are many costumes and cosmetic customizations that you can purchase within the NX store. While those cosmetic items do indeed have stats, they're definitely not needed to be well-geared for raids. Class elitism doesn't exist for the most common things, such as nests, although once you start getting into raids and other really tough things to clear, people will definitely have class preferences. That said, it's good to visit the forums on dragonnest.nexon.net and read about different classes, as well as do some googling on what's easiest to gear, what class is cheapest to get good at, etc, before jumping into this game. Most people I've met were extremely friendly, and it's never hard to party up and work with people for nests and quests. Guilds are also awesome in this game. There are many, and different types exist for different players, so everyone from casual to hardcore can find guilds to suit them. The market is also really well done now, and buying/selling is a smooth process.The fighting system is real-time and 3D, which makes for an AWESOME gameplay. It's super fast and has pve and pvp within the game, with reward systems and ability to acquire weapons by doing either. It's not all about stats - your ability to dodge monsters' abilities, other people's abilities, and the whole cartoon animation style is great. The one con that I would mention is that once you get really high level and your power runs out quickly, the game can get somewhat boring unless you have a guild or a group of friends to do raids and nests with. Being purely a solo player is a lonesome and boring life once you hit 70, and grinding does exist for the last 10-15 levels until you hit the cap. Overall I'd rate this game 8.5/10. It's solid,			"

One of my only dislikes is that character customization is very lacking. For instance there are only 2 hair styles for warrior, and no gender options. Aside from that I don't like that most of the women are sexualized to all hell, but if you can get passed that, it's a great game that deserves some attention from action and rpg fans alike.			"

												What can I say about Nexon that hasn't already been said? Cash shops and time sinkers... It's basically a glorified Maplestory. The horrible optimization leaves me doubting recommending this game at all. However, if you don't care about any of the aformentioned major crippling deficiencies that plague this game, try it out and embrace the grind.			"

												Intersting mmo.. it's not target based so you are not just tabbing through enemys and aim is required when using the skills you acquire. Leveling is fast and despite most mmo-rpg I've played the community isn't composed largely of young immature children who cant handle their emotions and consistantly troll others and take the fun out of it for everyone. Anime style graphics is nice and the animations aren't too shabby. Little bit of a learning curve but after a day or so it all starts to make sense if you are used to generic grind/gear based mmo's. Worth a shot.			"

												Great MMORPG. It seems easy at first but once you get to about level 20-25 you realize that all that time it was basicaly just the tutorial, wich means it gets really hardcore. you can get into raids from 5 to 35 people wich makes the game feel really intense. The graghics in this game are ok but what makes this game really stand out is the teh fact that even though there are only 5 or 6 classes you can have any mix you want, for instance you could be a healing class who is better at dps than healing or a tank that buffs the group, the options are almost unlimited for what role you can play. Over all i would rate this game 7.5/10. Hope to see you all in game sometime! "

												I think this is a good game. It reminds me of Guild Wars with the instance dungeons and I think it is nice you can go back to redo them at a higher level to challenge yourself or try it at the same level to get the best rating for better loot at the end. Cute graphics and the story that I have been following is interesting. My one complaint is I keep getting kicked off of it but I have afeeling that is more to do with my computer and connection.

												First off, I'd like to say that I'm not a huge fan of MMO's, but I do attempt some to see how I like them. And this one I absolutely fell in love with. It's got great gameplay (feels more like 3rd person action than an MMO, which I like) with some awesome abilities you can gain, a pretty good story that actually goes in depth, compared to some other MMO's I've played, and actually has some characters that you grow to care for. Not to mention that the style is very nice, along with the designs of most of the weapons and armor.The ONLY issue I would have to say (but this could be said about other games as well), is that when you get to higher levels, like 45+, you will need to grind so much XP, it can be a bit teadious. But, if you have a group of friends, or can make some new ones on here, then you can go do some nice raids, and high level grinding, and that'll help out a bit. Otherwise, this game is pretty awesome, and I've enjoy every moment I've spent playing it.			"

												Generally I'm not into MMOs because I don't find them engaging. The whole ""point at enemy, push button"" aspect is not appealing to me. However, this MMO is different from what I'm used to seeing from them. This one uses a hack and slash mechanic and is quite fun! I actually can't wait to get my next skill, instead of being generally confused when I learn a new one in other MMOs. This games is generally geared for a younger audience, so there's not much to it intellectually, but the characters and quests are charming and at times extremely funny. The whole game has a generic anime feel to it, but if you like good, clean fun in a pretty environment you can't go wrong here.			"

												This game is a fun and challenging action MMO set up with a fast-paced dungeon crawling experiance and a great social community. The camera is third person so you always feel like your in the action, with movement being in the WASD, The free to play system is fair and does NOT really affect balance between players, i.e. pay to win situation. Most of your money goes into cosmetics anywa. Plus the game runs, and looks great! I do recommend that you play with friends and take on harder, but more rewarding challenges. A lot of fun is to be had with friends. The only thing that may be discouraging is that you can't choose the specific sex you want to play as for each class. So if you want to be a female, warrior-brute, sorry :/  I didn't have any big gripes with that though. I would say go in, pick your play style, and have fun!			"

												To preface about myself, I've been playing this game since beta, and have well over 500 hours logged on this, since the switch to using Steam for Dragon Nest was relatively recent.I have a great time playing this game. It recently got revamped to make leveling from 1-50 easier, although it will still take time. It's definitely possible to finish the story line with just the gear you get from quests, although getting really good gear will definitely take time and in-game currency. While there are people who trade NX for gold and vice versa, this game is most definitely not pay 2 win, but there are many costumes and cosmetic customizations that you can purchase within the NX store. While those cosmetic items do indeed have stats, they're definitely not needed to be well-geared for raids. Class elitism doesn't exist for the most common things, such as nests, although once you start getting into raids and other really tough things to clear, people will definitely have class preferences. That said, it's good to visit the forums on dragonnest.nexon.net and read about different classes, as well as do some googling on what's easiest to gear, what class is cheapest to get good at, etc, before jumping into this game. Most people I've met were extremely friendly, and it's never hard to party up and work with people for nests and quests. Guilds are also awesome in this game. There are many, and different types exist for different players, so everyone from casual to hardcore can find guilds to suit them. The market is also really well done now, and buying/selling is a smooth process.The fighting system is real-time and 3D, which makes for an AWESOME gameplay. It's super fast and has pve and pvp within the game, with reward systems and ability to acquire weapons by doing either. It's not all about stats - your ability to dodge monsters' abilities, other people's abilities, and the whole cartoon animation style is great. The one con that I would mention is that once you get really high level and your power runs out quickly, the game can get somewhat boring unless you have a guild or a group of friends to do raids and nests with. Being purely a solo player is a lonesome and boring life once you hit 70, and grinding does exist for the last 10-15 levels until you hit the cap. Overall I'd rate this game 8.5/10. It's solid,			"

												First off- the most important thing is: the most fun I have had in a game since I was about ~12 (I'm 27, and i'm talking about FF7). The action in this game is... amazing. Fast paced, intense, and above all it's just fun.Also, character progression is great. Each class specs into 2 different tiers, and from there 2 more, etc. This, combined with the fact that you can spend your points on different abilities, means you can have 2 people from the class performing different roles and adds uniqueness (kinda) and flexibility. Each new ability you unlock can be dramatic, and the best part is you can pump points into any of them depending on how you want to play your character. I hate when games have the useful skills and the useless ones, and it's just a no brainer.Unfortuantely (and this may have changed since i last played- let me know if it has) the in-game economy is set to nickel and dime you to death. I played up to level cap (when it was 50). Each new level they give you items to seal your good equip/items (thus allowing you to sell on the player2player market, otherwise your item is tied to your character). But as soon as you reach level cap, you get no more of these. This means, once you are out, as i was, you have to pay a ridiculous price for these seals. I can't remember what the price was, but it was ludicrous. There are free ones you collect in the game, but after playing for hours upon hours (i think my game time was arounf 172 hours?) i blew all of them and got maybe a few to work, if that. The rate of success on these free ones was so low, and the price of the paid ones so high, that it wasn't worth playing anymore because I essentially couldn't make a decent amount of money and i certainly didn't want to ditch my epic gear to an in game store for pennies. I sincerely hope that has changed since i stopped, but i doubt it has. Let me know though if it has, because i would LOVE to pick this game up again.Also, i only dabbled in the PVP, but it was very good from what i played.If this game had an option to buy it outright for a set price ($60? i would pay more even...) and just let you buy and sell freely in the market, maybe with some other options, it would be in my top 10 games ever, imho.All in all, i would highly recommend playing this game- only with the foresight of knowing not to let yourself get addicted, only to have withdrawals when you force yourself off of it at level cap (when things get really interesting). Or maybe even play to level cap, and then start a new character.			"

												The odd art style is easily forgiveable for its intense combat and excellent presentation (with humorous, well translated dialogue for those interested in that). The presence of a pay-to-win shop is not as prominent as other games (if vanity items like instant use potions could be considered pay-to-win), since personal skill is as important a factor in survival as your gears. Hack-and-slash veterans will feel comfortable fighting at difficulties higher than what the design recommends. Although the sound design might not be as sharp as AAA titles, it gets the job done and isn't a massive distraction, with character voicing appropriate for their personalities.It's definitely worth trying.

Singleplayer and coop campaings . Very fun pvp arena with balanced classes. Muiltiplayer is a ton of fun.

												Won best PvP of E3 2011. That's when it was still growing here. This game due to verious reasons , one being it's art style , is what makes this game subjective to your taste. Some people played for a bit and wrote it off as unbalanced or child-like. Clearly not giving it much of a chance.First off it is in no way a pay-to-win. Second I've never seen too many games where your level is NOT the main thing that matters , but skill. An example when i first started I had a guild carry me to level 24 . I then faced a level 10 in pvp and lost. He knew what he was doing unlike me.With such a large variety or armour , sub-classes , and side-quest. It allows you to create and mold a unique powerful character to your liking. The story various character to character giving you more in-depth gameplay.Movement is fluid , fighting smooth. The game and the players never ceases to challenge you . You wont get bored unless you spoil it for your self. I mean that in a lot of ways. The fun in this game comes with the story, not knowing what new move you'll get next level, discovering new places, ccreating amazing weapons and armour, defining your character, and playing with the community. Ignore these things and trying to hard can ruin the experience of any mmo for you. Dont outcast yourself and just try and enjoy it. The only con i can actually think of is , gender lock. A lot of people just left huh? Well if gender choice is a must have , still give it a shot. If you are not having fun by level 25 (if you followed the quest the right way and paced your self) then go ahead and drop it. However you will be missing out. Lastly have fun. Some characters might not be for you, try something else. Try talking to people. Figure out how to fight. What moves work. Learn how to do and use things from certain quest. This game keeps you on your toes. Everything seems over whelming at first , but it is much simpler then you realize, and a lot more fun too.Personal opinon. Your first class just go for it. learn from your mistakes. you can always make a second class and trust me , eatch class is different enough where it wont be tedious in anway to start over. Assassin has my favorite story. Warrior my favorite moves. Cleric is fun for parties. Archer is good in PvP . I could go on forever , I already kind of did lol			"

												First off- the most important thing is: the most fun I have had in a game since I was about ~12 (I'm 27, and i'm talking about FF7). The action in this game is... amazing. Fast paced, intense, and above all it's just fun.Also, character progression is great. Each class specs into 2 different tiers, and from there 2 more, etc. This, combined with the fact that you can spend your points on different abilities, means you can have 2 people from the class performing different roles and adds uniqueness (kinda) and flexibility. Each new ability you unlock can be dramatic, and the best part is you can pump points into any of them depending on how you want to play your character. I hate when games have the useful skills and the useless ones, and it's just a no brainer.Unfortuantely (and this may have changed since i last played- let me know if it has) the in-game economy is set to nickel and dime you to death. I played up to level cap (when it was 50). Each new level they give you items to seal your good equip/items (thus allowing you to sell on the player2player market, otherwise your item is tied to your character). But as soon as you reach level cap, you get no more of these. This means, once you are out, as i was, you have to pay a ridiculous price for these seals. I can't remember what the price was, but it was ludicrous. There are free ones you collect in the game, but after playing for hours upon hours (i think my game time was arounf 172 hours?) i blew all of them and got maybe a few to work, if that. The rate of success on these free ones was so low, and the price of the paid ones so high, that it wasn't worth playing anymore because I essentially couldn't make a decent amount of money and i certainly didn't want to ditch my epic gear to an in game store for pennies. I sincerely hope that has changed since i stopped, but i doubt it has. Let me know though if it has, because i would LOVE to pick this game up again.Also, i only dabbled in the PVP, but it was very good from what i played.If this game had an option to buy it outright for a set price ($60? i would pay more even...) and just let you buy and sell freely in the market, maybe with some other options, it would be in my top 10 games ever, imho.All in all, i would highly recommend playing this game- only with the foresight of knowing not to let yourself get addicted, only to have withdrawals when you force yourself off of it at level cap (when things get really interesting). Or maybe even play to level cap, and then start a new character.			"

												I'm going to say it right now: this game is  VERY  ""grindy."" If you plan on getting the  decent  gear or that top pvp ladder spot you better be ready to grind those dungeons till your eyes bleed. It is very much a grind-to-win game. And is the very standard ""Collect X amounts of stuff"" MMO crap that we have come to enjoy (sarcasm). The story is mediocre at best. Customer support is quite possible one of the worst, as the publisher is Nexon.That being said though, it still has it's great moments. If you just sit back and ignore all of those fancy collectables and pvp lags, you will realize that it can be enjoyable. The skills and classes are very diverse and offer a lot of interesting combos and techniques to play around with in both pvp and pve. The community (for the most part) is friendly and willing to help you if need be. And the variety of enemies the game throws at you keeps pve challenging and engaging.5.5/10 This game barely edges out on my scale. Do not play this game unless you like running the same dungeon repeatedly because you will not like it. However, if you are truly just in it for the experience and not the competitiveness, it can still be an entertaining game.			"

												Game's fun. Hop on it.Edit: Okay, finally, time for an actual (really quick) review.Dragon Nest is an Action-MMO (Aka, not your typical tab-target, spam F1-F5 MAX DPS ROTATION GOOOO WoW clone) with a fairly deep story, and decently done in game cinematics.Its a dungeon based 3d-beat-em-up meets MMO essentially. There are 6 characters, each with 2 subclasses, and then 2 more subclasses branching from those, and a 7th character (The Assassin) somewhere down the line coming.Controls are pretty tight, and the game looks great. Each class has a large amount of varied skills, and you have the freedom to build the characters how you want (though, there are obviously prereqs for skills you may have to meet).NPCs are actually fun to talk to, and there's quite a large amount of dungeons in game.Those things being said, there are a few downsides, and I highly suggest you take them into consideration before you sink time (and money) into the game:1. While leveling, you'll find yourself making very long trips into town to talk to a bunch of really spread out npcs for questing reasons. Its tolerable in Lotus Marsh and the starter towns since they're pretty small, but its utterly atrocious in Saint's Haven, as its such a big place, and entering the castle counts as a map change. It drags the pace of the game down considerably at times.2. Its hosted by Nexon. For those of us familiar with them, I need not say more. For those who aren't, Nexon is a VERY greedy company, known for charging their players out the (insert word for butt here) for many things. While the game is free to play, you'll find yourself wanting avatars (armor that provides slight stat bonuses, but mainly exists for cosmetic reasons), and other things from their in-game shop. The prices in the shop for said avatars are misleading, as those are the prices for the shortest duration non-permanent version of the item. Instead, if you wish to keep things forever, you'll find yourself paying about 5 bucks per piece, which well, is a lot. Which is further compounded by the fact that NX items are not tradeable, so you can't just buy them off other people with in-game money outside of specific circumstances.Those two probems aside (pace-breaking quest gathering sequences that take up to 20 minutes sometimes), and overpriced cash shop items, its an extremely fun game gameplay-wise, and I'd suggest checking it out if you're looking for an actual game when you think of MMOs.

												Love this game, its got everything you'd be looking for. Action, Adventure, anime style characters, (some REALLY cute!)  the only downfall is that you have to pay for a larger storage and backpack. It's 4 outta 5 stars on that. Game play and story is 5 stars. Overall rating on the game: 4.8 outta 5 stars. David the whatever he is for the moment is annoying as hell but fun to rescue when he chickens out... on everything. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes LoL, WoW, and Spiral Knights. It could be the breath of fresh air you're looking for in a game.			"

												The best of both worlds! Action and RPG elements. This isn't your traditional MMORPG! Great anime style graphics, overly steroided monsters and tons of bouncy goodness. One of the few free to play games where you don't get stuck until you spend money in the online store. Without spending a penny you have access to the full game. This game is highly recommended for people who have become jaded with the standard World of Warcraft clones out there. You can actually make real progress playing an hour at a time instead of having to organize a raid that takes 8-10 hours of nonstop game play. Even the largest dungeon takes an hour or less.			"

												This MMORPG is absolutely addicting!! It is pretty fast paced and action packed to the gills, some drawbacks to the game that Ive had are those pesky SPEED HACKS... I would be in the middle of a dungeon then all of a sudden I get kicked from the game... Atleast I am a patient person so I boot it back up when it happens, so its not a big deal for me. I havent been big on PVP on any game but I decided to have a go with it, it seems that in order to have a good PVP match, you have to be at a high level such as lvl 60... when I first became lvl 24 and was able to get to Saints Haven I tried the PVP, I couldnt find a single person at my lvl to pvp with, it was kind of a let down on that part. The customization is lacking quite a bit, all of the characters are gender locked, so if you want a female warrior then you are out of luck. On the plus side of things, I managed to use a handeld gamepad for this game and it managed to work pretty well, although it lacks the ability to hold more spells and skills than the game allows. The graphics are quite pleasing, and the sound is fun!! I highly recommend this game to anybody who likes fast paced mmorpg's!!			"

												Great MMORPG. For me, it was my first experience with a game like this. Mainly because it was 3D. :3 Don't judge me. Anyways, it was a beautiful game with fast and stylish combat as well as vivid characters and decent humour. I suggest you give it a try until the end. The main problems for me when playing is that, the game is quite slow and tedious. At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards. I still recommend this game for all ages. I have friends playing this game from as young as 10 to 30 xD. 8.5/10 Great combat and story. "

												Not as many hours clocked in as I know i'm going to spend tons in the future on this game. Addicting, fun, and never gets boring. The only way i could see it get boring is if you are soloing dungeons alone. The storyline is great so if you're a fan of that stuff you could always do that. Lacks alittle bit of customization being that you need to spend money to buy cosmetics but for a free to play i can't say that's bad. I recommend. 4.5/5.			"

												The combat alone is good enough for me to say this is one of the best MMORPG's.  Its real time combat is just so much more entertaining and seems like the better direction for MMO's to go. The story is also very well done. Although it is slow at start once you get around level 30 its awesome !			"

												Intersting mmo.. it's not target based so you are not just tabbing through enemys and aim is required when using the skills you acquire. Leveling is fast and despite most mmo-rpg I've played the community isn't composed largely of young immature children who cant handle their emotions and consistantly troll others and take the fun out of it for everyone. Anime style graphics is nice and the animations aren't too shabby. Little bit of a learning curve but after a day or so it all starts to make sense if you are used to generic grind/gear based mmo's. Worth a shot.			"

												Great MMORPG. It seems easy at first but once you get to about level 20-25 you realize that all that time it was basicaly just the tutorial, wich means it gets really hardcore. you can get into raids from 5 to 35 people wich makes the game feel really intense. The graghics in this game are ok but what makes this game really stand out is the teh fact that even though there are only 5 or 6 classes you can have any mix you want, for instance you could be a healing class who is better at dps than healing or a tank that buffs the group, the options are almost unlimited for what role you can play. Over all i would rate this game 7.5/10. Hope to see you all in game sometime! "

												Another online game by Nexon that is similar to Vindictus, but definately different.  Dragon Nest has a bit more of an RPG feel to it than Vindictus. The control is a bit different and resembles more like a mix of Vindictus and Guild Wars 2. However like other free online RPGs, its not really MMO, and its not very open world.  Missions are fun, but NPCs make you do them over and over. 4 character classes to choose from (again gender locked), Fighter(Male), Cleric,(Male) Archer(Elf fFemale), and sorceress (Female).  At upper levels you get class changes and take different class specializations.  Lots of fun, but you will tire of it if you play too much.			"

												Action MMO that does so much perfectly. Where I live (US) the game feels fluid, no lag, no delay on when I press a move do I see my character reacting. This feeling is so importnant and most games fail to deliver on this. The game is a little micro transaction heavy. Simple things that should be free or earned (like inv space, respecs) are pay for. Also costume items have stats so while they aren't make or break good, they do give a serious boost when added up. One other thing that could be considered bad is some of the best stuff (like big wings that make you run faster) can only be obtained via ""Dragon Eggs"" which are pay for booster packs that contain a random item. This makes it very cool when you get something but also makes you hesitate to buy an egg, becuase it could be a whammy. Overall the gameplay is awesome, story is very random and anime-like. Lots of fun even if you stay away from the pay shop.			"

												Action packed RPG with tonnes of nuianced, creative, and just plain fun game play.  Beautiful in game art and cutscenes.  Some of the best writing, storylines, and NPC character development I have seen in forever. Immense in scope and pursuable quests. Clever crafting, character building, market system, and social interaction. Dragon Nest is an easter egg on Steam that it seems few people know about and part of me doesnt want to share, but the people who make this game possible should have their coffers lined with gold for such a well made excellently written and enjoyable game. Suggestion:1. Don't be afraid of challenging and even angering some players with impossible to beat quests.Abyss difficulty at any character level of play should be nigh impossible without a team no matter how good you, equipment, and teammates are. Inscrutable difficulty wins respect, is the best pr, and get the most diehard loyal fans which this truly great game deserves in spades.Likers Like. Haters gonna hate.

												This is unlike any other MMO that is currently on the market. It features crazy fast, arcade-like action mixed with the strategy and planning of an MMO. It has a very engaging story that makes your decisions in quests feel like they matter with great humor scattered throughout the whole thing.In addition to this, all of the content is free. You don't have to buy your levels or your raids, you only buy cosmetic items. And while those cosmetics offer special bonuses for characters which are helpful, they don't impact the game in such a way that it turns it into ""pay to win"". Would play with friends.Would play solo.Would recomend for anyone.			"

												Dragon Nest is a fun and easy to pick up mmo with both pve and pvp features. Several different classes with several different specializations. What more can you want? Graphically speaking its not as breath taking as more recent things but its good enough for even someone who prefers older graphics over new. The story line changes a bit for each character which makes each new character a different experience. Keep in mind you start off in a random guild so if you want your own gotta talk to the npc first to leave that guild. Also can't delete a character that is part of a guild (even that default guild).

												Surprisingly good for a F2P game! :)Except for the part where all of the classes are gender-locked...and don't pick Archer and specialize Acrobat (I suggest Sharpshooter) as a new player. You'll need Dendi's reflexes (if you know who he is) and insane hand-eye coordination.			"

												Heavily stylized, varried gameplay, visually interesting enemies, action-rpg elements, and a system that allows for the building of 'relationships' with NPC's and their factions through an NPC gifting system*, knowledgable and friendly community - What more could you want from an Action-RPG MMO? If you want more 'realism' in your art style check Vindictus - themeatically similar elements and familiar Action-RPG gameplay.Accessable, Free to Play, less of a grind and more of a light hearted good time.If the art style is the only thing stoping you from checking it out - to each their own. Check out Vindictus instead, another F2P light hearted title from the same publisher. *The NPC/Faction/Renown gifting system is incredibly grindy, the gifts are relatively common drops but you need hundreds upon hundreds to make an impact.

												Fun and intense, true free fighting Dragon Nest is one of my favorite MMO's that are free to play. Its diverse fighting is one of the best little features in the game. Anime style graphics make this game look great. When your fighting you will definatley feel like you are breaking the earth. Only setbacks of this game is it is gender locked and that there isnt very much character customization. Sooner or later though NA (North America) will get more classes such as the Assassin which is Dragon Nests' biggest project at the minute. The Assassin is only available in its birth place, Korea, and is based on what his name is, an assassin. Very good game, despite those bad features the game looks great and is very fun and addicting.			"

Ranging from simple graphic to Getting stuck in one area no matter what. One viciuos one is a cutscene's black bars to stick, throughing you into combat with no pots or skills, solved by dying or killing the boss.Npc's almost never give you respect.Random parties suck.Besides the games bugs, I would recommend it if u like nexon games. 8/10			"

												I've returned to my old account after a year and was playing on the Nexon Launcher which will explain the lack of hours recorded on steam. This review is meant to be a general overview on the gameplay, graphics and what to expect for returning players or new players completely new to this game going from level 1 to 90.Good The combat is fast paced and can be quite fun with the various combos you can use Sub-class system is something that you can look forward to when progressing through the game The storyline content is actually quite good in my opinion (Assassin storyline) Everything except for the newest content and raids are soloableBad The textures are atrocious even on highest quality settings Upon entering Saint's Haven everyone WILL have wings, glowing weapons and all manner of cosmetics that will make you look like you crawled out of the gutter Everyone WILL be more geared than you You WILL be flooded with free and/or time-limited cash shop items that you WILL have no idea what to do with them You WILL run the same dungeon 4-6 times each during the course of the storyline You WILL be confused with NPC's all over the map that act as exchange shops for items that you don't understand how to use (Goddess Lament - Priestess of Darkness) There is NO collision detection on the weaker mobs Mounts seem kinda useless relative to just teleporting to NPC's through map They removed Hard and Abyss Mode for most of the dungeons under Level 80? Classic Catch22, trying to get good gear to run the latest raid when NO one wants to run with you due to your crummy gear Late game dungeons absolutely crushes your FTG Don't forget the dragon eggs to make your bank account cryIt's a fun game to pick up if you want to try something new, but I do not recommend this game long term.Glossary:FTG: A gauge that decreases everytime you enter a dungeon, the exp in dungeons gets a bonus but you get a penalty if the gauge is depletedAbyss: One of the harder difficulty levels for a dungeon, mobs are significantly tougherDragon Eggs: The typical gachapons in most MMORPGsGoddess Lament: One of the many ""tokens"" you farm for on dailies or quests in order to exchange these ""tokens"" at the NPC for desired items			"

												Dragon Nest has the smoothest fighting mechanics I have ever seen in an MMORPG. The People who run the servers are the nicest bunch and ACTUALLY TAKE WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND WANT INTO CONSIDERATION, The game is based around personal improvment and makes you want to play it for longer.Grinding sounds pretty boring right? Well the fighting just feels so good that grinding isn't a chore!!! The only negative I have found in this game is the lack of flexibiltiy when it comes to gender choices because they are allready set with the class you choose. But gender doesn't really matter in this game.The story is excellent and is easy to follow! No confusion, and doesn't even have to be done, great cut scenes and each character has an individial story and they all are connected to eachother (kinda like a puzzle). P.S. The fighting moves are great and also the PvP is smexy (there are no annoying-♥♥♥ factions)			"

												I honestly only played for about 20 minutes. The gameplay seemed fun in the first ""dungeon."" but overall I can't see myself playing a game in the long run that is instance based. I mean the towns you can see players by joining different channels etc, but to actually participate with others in quests and what-not you have to party with them. That just takes too much out of an MMORPG for me. In my opinion it's actually NOT an MMO. Otherwise every game on xbox live where you can make a lobby and play with 5 people is an MMO as well, IE call of duty, Halo, basically every game out there.			"

												It is your standard MMO. Nothing unique or outstanding of it. However, the servers are severely poor and very laggy. At one point, my entire party disconnected due to the server lag. Also, during a dungeon run, I lagged so terribly, I was literally hitting nothing. Of course, I was getting hit. So much that I died due to the lag. I do not suggest anyone playing this.

I've followed this game for awhile now with +4000 hrs logged in (favored the launcher over steam) and i'm pretty bummed about the route this game went. One hit bossess and mobs all the way till cap in PvE, PvP is pretty dead now, and so is alot of the towns. Mostly just vets and idles lookin for them ever so juicy likes. This game will always have a great place in my heart, and wallet. Here's to hoping MapleStory 2 comes to us Westerners and that its not ♥♥♥♥ on like this. I'd reccommend if we could go back about 3 or so years...how the time flies...			"

												Dragon Nest is an amazing interactive online action mmo. The combat system is along the lines of Kingdoms of Amalur (with flashier skills) with a 4 player Co-op dungeon system added into it. It also has a branching job advancement system where you choose your path of skill development depending on your preferences. The game started with 4 classes: Warrior, Mage, Archer, and Priest, Since the 2 more classes have been added: Alchemist and Dancer. The Thief/Assassin is currently in Korea and on its way to the US soon. I'm sure more classes will be available for years to come. I suggest you watch this video ""

												Currently playing this game for 4-5 years now.Combat is amazing, one of the best I've seen from MMOs.Music is pretty good & storyline is okay but you'll most likely not get into it at all when you play the game as its not a big factor in gameplay. (You can literally grind your way to level cap without doing storyline/side quests).In my opinion, any content but raiding is pretty boring in the game.. but some people may enjoy the PvP.Also the community in NA is pretty horrible if you visit their forums but as every MMO has horrible people, there's amazing people too.I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have lots of free time on your hands, connections or lots of money to spend.

												Lets face it we all hate nexons customer service, but they do make some great titles games that grip you. COming from vindictus this game seem like a childs game but in the long run has great pvp system. The controls are very responsive and has great comabt mechanics. The community is very helpful and enjoys running things together. Raids are a challange and you can find yourself face down in the dirt real quick. If you are a fan of any action mmo then you should try out dragon nest. They have introduced the new assassin class which is super bad ♥♥♥, you want crazy dps all I have to say is shinobi.Pros: great community, awesome pve, great mechanics and great anime style graphics, Dont need a top end pc, crazy good pvp including more then one pvp mode, not an over priced store.Cons: Grind fest which can lead to a headache, nexon customer service(have better luck in forums). SInce it is free to play there are outfits which boost stats (they do have free offers to do for currency), so you can consider this slighty pay to win( in pvp) but i have seen people whip ♥♥♥ a free to play. Combos have a slight learning curve which can lead to frustration when pvping against a temptest who knwos roation are any class for that matter.			"

												Dragon Nest is an exciting, action-packed combat game. In the beginning, it starts out slow but as you continue and in the game and start gaining new skills, the term ""fast-paced"" comes true and you'll be creating long combos and defeating enemies in no time. Although the character customizing is a bit small and not many options, this is great for anybody who wants to play a fun MMORPG without needing to use money to make the experience better.			"

												This is one, if not, the best of all of the MMORPGS I have every played, and have had the pleasure to experience.  The storyline is amazing, and keeps you wanting to read most of the dialogue the characters have to offer, the many landscapes look beautiful, even with the old-school type graphics this game harbours. And, finally, the gameplay. It is the best aspect of this game so far, and it's what makes this game different from other MMORPGS. You feel like you're actually controlling your character; it isn't the same 'point and click' formula which has, unfortunately, taken control of most other MMORPGs of the era. Above all else, this game manages to be a unique, excellent experience which I am sure that you will all treasure.			"

												A fun action MMO with a colorful look, a sense of humor, and a lot to keep you coming back for more.  It's geniunely plain entertaining, and pretty easy to get into, letting you enjoy the game without trying to sort out too much arcana or data dumps.  Game progression is also logical, so there's always something new to try out.  Stylistically the cartoony nature keeps it light, though there are elements of odd fanservice, seriousness, and irreverance that don't quite gel and seem odd.  However that's no reason not play what is honestly a good, fun, and rather precise game, wether you want to melt foes with fire, smash them with a sword, or just release a mechanical butler and a legion of roboducks.

												Personal opnion: This game is very good but at some point repetetive. There is some hilarious parts in this and it has potential to be very good. I recommend to play this with friends or you might be bored is a couple minutes unless your used to lonly repetetiveness. after a while this game feels boring so i suggest playing this when your bored. The download time is pretty good for a game with this type of stuff in it. In all i  i belive that this game gets a 7.5/10. its fine if you dont agree with my opinion we all have are opinion.Graphics: Graphics are just fine some times there dull and feel ok-ish but its good graphics. The graphics are fine if you dont mind them personally i dont mind them. At the same time thee graphics are AWESOME it has some detail but compared to other pc games in 2012 its about a fair-ish judgment atleast for my standards.Gameplay: The Gameplay is fairly simple as for a mmo rpg with your types of skills and how you build your character.Theres not to much about leveling up and skills its kinda like all rpg skill stuff. As if it comes to customisations to your character there goes the something about this game i dont like because once you have made your character the only thing that changes about it is you characters weapon and thats it no armor change when you put on different armor this dosent bug me too much. as for the fighting machanics this is very simple to acomplish as all of it is going in worlds fighting by clicking and activating your skills by pressing 1 2 3 and etc. In this game the many levels you play have difficultly and thats your choice on which you choose which is good i like a challenge some times. As for other gameplay aspects i did not cover i think the gameplay could be improved a slight bit.Music: As for music there are some music to comfort you as you roam around fighting in each level and the city. Theres not to much to talk about music as when you play this game your more likely to ignore it as for playing while listenning but still the music was a nice feature so you dont get bored :3. I honestly found the music as for trying to listen to it its ok to take a while to stop and listen and relax....And here is the end of the worst review in the world i bet no one will read this and etc cya.

												This game has an amazing story. i am always jumping in and out of this game. i played it when it was in beta on their website. it has always been great. weapons and enemies always amaze me. but for the classes i wish they would add a gender option 1 day. but either way the archer and sorceress are ok to me. i still just like the warrior the best. always have.

												So far so good. A much better choice then Aura Kingdom imo. Great graphics, great art style, much more of a challenge then AK I should add, none of that point and click everything crap. You feel like your playing this game, and has controller support. Love the battle system, its fast , and the camera view can be set to thst of resident evil 4 if you wanted.

""Also can lead into a grinding fest if you don't reach the level requirement of a quest, then your only hope is to do plenty of sidequests. Mainly the quest that will have you grind is going to Saint's Haven which requires you to have a level of 25 I believe, I can't remember. The combat system is really fun and doesn't get as repetitive as most games do. But a dissapoint in gender-locked classes. Most classes in this game you would see in any other MMORPG excluding Kali, don't bash me about tinkerer because it's pretty much a ranged shooting class.Downside is the community support, which I'm pretty sure we're not surprised because it was developed by Nexon.Over all, I find this game pretty fun and you can get into quite easily.

												tldr:  Not a bad game.  But not the kind of game I will spend time in.I did nto get far.  At all.  Between the cutesy art and giant boobs, or the rediculously basic tutorial, I can see that the game is not meant for me, a 30+ year old gamer who wants to be challanged and have skilled paly rewarded.What thres me off the game:  Extremely limited range, on ""Ranged"" characters.  Also, (might be chagable, I did not attempt to fix) the camera aims your spells/attacks.  Meanig you have to look at the badguy you want to hit.  Not a bad thign right?  Except it meant it I was constantly shooting at things feet because I did wanted to keepa  good veiw of the game as well.  But you effectively have to choose between aiming and seeing from a decent angle.You start out weak I get that.  I'm sure the game gets better.  That's the nature of MMO's.  For all I know 5 minutes further down the road it gets less bland,   But the beginning skills for the 4 classes I tried, were rediculously boring and uninspired conpared to the very interesting skill videos showed off at character creation.  And I don't want another ""grind through the boring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in hopes of to getting to the good stuff"" game.  I have enough other games that are fun from the get go to choose from.Not a bad game, but no pull to entice the player past the tutorial that teaches you how to push the spacebar.  But it just gives no reason to play it over other games.			"

												Dragon Nest:  Much like the latest Folger's commercial, Dragon Nest doesn't seek to surpass the typical MMO, it looks to land right where every single other one has already innovated, and in most cases, the others have done so in much more engaging and profound ways.  In fact, Dragon Nest doesn't tread any new ground what-so-ever.Prepare for another... Umm... Adventure?  Dragon Nest features a tired storyline that never engages the player, character classes and progressions you've seen for the last decade (or two), an uninspired crafting and upgrade system that's been done to death by every j/k-RPG on the market, and an overpriced cash shop that attempts to lure you in with functions that remove many of the, simply put, intentional annoyances of trying to play the game, such as pitifully limited inventory space and automatic loot pickups.Gameplay is nearly completely combat-based, with drawn-out town segments featuring quest gathering and loot selling.  Combat fails to innovate; expect keyboard gymnastics and mouse-flinging typical of this genre, often interrupted by loading screens every few minutes.  Seriously... The loading screens destroy any immersion to be had here.I would dare to say that the game features some unique artwork and a handful of beautifully modelled monsters and characters, but most of the game centers around scantily-clad female characters (because that's what appeals to the typical gamer, right guys?) which you are introduced to immediately during the game's first loading screen, and 'emo' androgenous males that have left their ""provocative"" stink on every RPG from the east since Square-Enix.Music and sound effects are nothing worth mentioning; I was mostly annoyed by the droning music clips that are featured and muted it within an hour of my playtime.  Sound effects are cartoonish and repetitive, and their lack of variety becomes painfully apparent during combat.  It should be no surprise that the voice acting featured in the game is top-notch, cream-of the-crop, steaming garbage-on-a-hot-summer-day that always sounds completely out of context; how these voice actors are cast or maintain careers is completely lost on me.The story begins with you being some ho-hum walking randomly through the wilderness, and two little girls are attacked by orcs, one being some oracle that you're desperately trying to save for eons, yet every single time you get close, you feel like you should see ""Sorry Mario, but the princess is being held in another castle!""  Oh, and there are evil dragons, apparently.  Most NPC dialogue seems to assume you know what's going on in this world, but the game doesn't ever make an earnest attempt at introducing any of the lore to you so that you know what the hell is going on.Overall, Dragon Nest is a mediocre game; it doesn't innovate in any area, and it's formula is tried and true.  It may be free-to-play, but it makes every possible attempt to make you open your wallet to essentially unbreak itself.  Being a Nexon game, expect their lovely gem 'HackShield' to break and crash your game on a near-hourly basis, often throwing false-positives or simply having some kind of failure that will cause you to lose your progress mid-dungeon.  3 / 10			"

												It's an action rpg game with short instances that you can play with friends. Pros: - Different classes to choose from with each two different specializations - Gear and loot - Action combo based gameplay - Graphics are correctCons: - Buggy collision (sometimes you hit right on enemy and there is no effect - Gameplay feels mechanic even though it is more actif than your average rpg game. - Lots of quest about talking to a serie of npcs early in game without any explanation about how the game works, juste about some basic background story for some npcs. (could be a positive aspect for some people, I personally just wanted to play and try the gameplay before getting into the side story) - Not a lot of explanation about how to regroup or join friends that aren't at the same starting point as you. (Comes when you can meet, but you have to play 3-4 instances before you can really join. Simply not a game for me. It was over hyped by the community and compared to Vindictus in term of action. I can affirm there is no ressemblance. It is was more mechanical than its Nexon's related.			"

												I would probably recommend this game without a second thought 3-4 years ago back when it was 60-70 lvl cap not today though. Before looking at my 33hours on record and thinking i didn't play the game enough i probably have around 2K hours on the SEA server so trust me i played more then enough of this game and i can say without doubt the game is just dead at this point. They bsaically reworked the entire game to where only late game matters after you reach max level and by the time this review is posted max level is 93 so around lvl1 to 93 is just a grind fest and with the game being already pretty much dead most likely its going to be a solo grind then with actual players. Getting partys for raids and such is so hard if your new basically if your new and looking for a mmo game dont bother with this its not new user friendly at all you will feel you are playing a solo game until you reach max level and get good gear. 3 years ago : HELL YEAH PLAY THIS GAME so much fun doing nests ( 4 man really hard dungeouns ) and dragon nests ( 8man raid ) just do main quests / side quests or grind up with party members today : solo grind to 93. find a way to obtain good gear somehow. try to find a party or guild to do raids with ( too much hassle and pain not worth it anymore ) "

That being said, don't expect any real challenge until your level 16ish and you can do expert mode			"

												Dragon nest is the **** it's like playing a single player role playing game with friends.The dungeons are insane and the gameplay  is epic. All the skills are different for each class. Six different classes each with there own subclass The animation may look child like but don't get it wrong the game will blow your mind. Also you don't even need to read the npc text just watching the cutscenes will give you the facts about what going on in the story. There tons of dungeons and pvp arena's. This is one of the best nexon games out there. The download is fast and the controls are easy to use. Theres tons of people to meet. The game is full of 8 people dragon raid dungeons where you can earn uniqe items and equipment. Thier is so much to do in this world even if the animation style is a kiddish approach.			"

												I would probably recommend this game without a second thought 3-4 years ago back when it was 60-70 lvl cap not today though. Before looking at my 33hours on record and thinking i didn't play the game enough i probably have around 2K hours on the SEA server so trust me i played more then enough of this game and i can say without doubt the game is just dead at this point. They bsaically reworked the entire game to where only late game matters after you reach max level and by the time this review is posted max level is 93 so around lvl1 to 93 is just a grind fest and with the game being already pretty much dead most likely its going to be a solo grind then with actual players. Getting partys for raids and such is so hard if your new basically if your new and looking for a mmo game dont bother with this its not new user friendly at all you will feel you are playing a solo game until you reach max level and get good gear. 3 years ago : HELL YEAH PLAY THIS GAME so much fun doing nests ( 4 man really hard dungeouns ) and dragon nests ( 8man raid ) just do main quests / side quests or grind up with party members today : solo grind to 93. find a way to obtain good gear somehow. try to find a party or guild to do raids with ( too much hassle and pain not worth it anymore ) "

												Dragon Nest is a typical free-to-play MMORPG that you can play solo or with partying with friends. It doesn't offer anything really special compared to other MMOs and it is extremely casual.The graphics are alright and the music is pretty good, the gameplay is fluid... But, that's far from being the issue i'm having with this game. Pay-to-win usually is, you know, somewhat bad and it makes you stronger than players who don't pay or it takes longer to achieve a certain level of power... But in Dragon Nest it's an entirely new story.I started a new character and I was questing with a friends, Monsters took about 3-4 hits each and using spells usually one or two shotted them, you know, pretty standard... Until we earned NX gear from our ""Reward Chest"" at around level 9 (you obtain one of those everytime you level up). It was a full set of NX (paid) gear that lasts 7 days. Now, the monsters I was fighting at around this level had about 50 health maybe... And I was hitting around 10-15 damage with my basic attacks.Well, after I equiped the gear, I was hitting around 4000 with my basic attacks and the monsters were just as weak as before! So for the next few levels, I was 1 hitting everything, including bosses with my basic attack... How fun!Also, in your ""Reward Chest"" you can find ""Goddess's Laments"". They're used to craft armour, weapons and jewelry... But, they have only implemented armour and weapons for the older classes or something, because if you play a Machina, you can only craft jewelry with those crafting materials and nothing else!Another thing, if you have played this game before and you want to play it on Steam, you can never get the Steam exclusive mount, because you need a fresh account to obtain it.Overall, the game is way too easy, anyone could play it with the paid gear you are given and you get it every few levels it seems. I wouldn't bother playing such a game.			"

												Dragon nest is an dungeon based RPG and I wasted half of my summer on this game for few reasons.It has Anime-ish style graphics that I always enjoy.There is alot of contents to do especially max level that is very team oriented.Hundreds of quests to complete and a decent storyline.Fast paced game.Fun game to play with friends.PvP is intense (except fighting assassins).All classes has unique skills and combos.Cash shop is aight.Nice animationsCan see Irine's pantsu.But oh boy those cons though.This game is one of the grindest game I have ever witnessed. I've ran the same dungeon 200 times to get from 60-70.The game has very limited character customization in creation and makes you spend your dough to change your appearance.Gender lock classes.The story can get repetitive since it makes you go back to the same dungeon 10 times so people just grinds the same spot to reach a certain level.You get very little exp from dungeon runs so you level very slow unless you are hardcore at this game.PvP lag is very noticeable in every room.High level nest parties are very discriminative in gear and class.Events are pretty much cash shop related.I r8 it 8/8 "

												Dragon Nest is probably one of the best MMO RPGs out there. It's amazing, and just because it's free to play, doesn't mean you have to buy to progress. The only things you buy are costumes, but, there are better costumes you can wear without paying. I've played around 70 hours, and the campaign still hasn't stopped!  Also, the gameplay is never TOO grindy or easy, It's actually really cool!It seems to be something similar to Final Fantasy, but i'd recommend it much more.			"

I am now going to uninstall the game and whoever looks at this, understands you should not get this game nor buy anything in it. I am not gonna reccomend this to my friends and also another thing.. Maybe you should have a better layour because I CANT FIND A DAMN THING THE IN TOWN WHERE YOUR SUPPOST TO FIND STUFF. I LOOKED ALL OVER AND FOUND NO SHOP OR ANYTHING.

												Dragons Nest, this is not a bad game for free, its rather amuzing and fun.. its just a little dated with graphics, and i guess i can expect that being its going on 2 years old. Is this game worth playintg, sure.. why not.. its fast paced, easy controls, fun gameplay. I mean for free it dont get much better then that. Of course you have the option to buy items in store, but i have not really taken the time to look into their store since there is not much of a community playing the game, so i rather not put any money into buying any cool items from their store as i would see it as a waste. I do recommend this game if you are bored and looking for something to pass the time for a couple weeks while you wait for your next game to be released or something like that. I will definitly be watching out for a part 2 of this game if it ever comes out, hopefully it will full the community.			"

												Fun, easy to learn hard to master game. Saying that now-a-days doesn't sound like much, but if you're into action combat, and you're willing to look past Nexon, which I highly recommend you do, this is an incredibly fun time and has a lot of skill based gameplay that can be fun for anyone.8/10 probably the best Action Combat MMO I've played in a while.

												they ruined the game by not adding in a permanent account transfer from Nexon to EYEDENTITY self service, so if you have played in the past or paid money to this game in the past, it is all gone unless you did an account transfer before september 2016... seriously a big scummy move on their part... i will never play this game again after putting so much time and money into it in the past and it being gone when the game isnt even gone...i suggest never to touch this game due to such poor decision making by developers.

												It's like Vindictus light.  Everything is just a bit smaller.  Combat is active, no need to target enemies, but then it's ruined by the need for numbered hotkeys for skills.If you found Vindictus too intense or too active or too grindy, this may be the game for you.The graphics suck.  PS1 level graphics rendered at a higher resolution.  The textures look like 20% Jpegs.			"

												My impressions from trying Dragon Nest. Up front I'll say I didn't stay to find out how certain things work because my first impressions made me not care enough to do so, so take everything with a grain of salt. Also, the game's changed hands, so what the new management might do in the near future to change any of this I have no idea.TL;DR: I don't hate the game, but it did annoy me, for a number of reasons detailed below.First off, I couldn't find a way to re-bind default keyboard commands.  ---[Edit Note: Uninstalled, so I can't look, but see Amazia's response in the comments about the game's two separate keybind menus.]---  To move stuff around on the hotbars, or add skills to hotbars, or open a map of the default keybinds, yes. But to do something like re-bind the WASD movement to what I normally use in games (for physical reasons, not just preferential ones), no. I looked at least three times, and it's usually pretty obvious in games and the first thing I do in them. This made combat so aggravatingly awkward for me that I don't know if I can comment with any degree of objectivity. I did still manage to hit things in the starting game, and they fell over and coughed some loot onto the ground with their dying breaths, so there's that.Moving on... Gender-specific classes aren't a dealbreaker, and I knew going in and was prepared to ignore that the male characters look like kids and female characters look like short-skirted cheesecake dollies. Welcome to anime-meets-video games, right? To be fair, when it comes to anime or manga, my preferred style is more in the range of any version of Appleseed, say, than this, but I've enjoyed things done in other styles if they had enough going for them. The wispy-girly voice acting for the female characters was annoying as I watched the intro and tutorial cutscenes, and I ended up hitting Mute and accepting that I would miss stuff that way. Female character emote audio wasn't a lot better. The male character audio was... well, it was what you'd expect from a male protagonist anime character in this style. It didn't irk me like the female voices and didn't stick in my mind enough to have an opinion on it.On the subject of character appearances, though... The initial appearance customization options are extremely limited -- three faces and three sets of eyes, maybe four hairstyles, a handful of hair and eye colors and skin tones, one outfit with a few pieces for which you can separately choose from a small selection of colors. Meh. Based on this limited customization, when I looked it up, I expected that Dragon Nest had to be a lot older than it is. I might have forgiven it if it was, or if its characters were so tiny they're just blobs of color with legs and weapons during play. But this isn't a ""tiny blobs of color"" game, so it feels like an ""option B"" game, wherein appearance customization beyond the initial kids' menu of choices will probably involve microtransactions. (Which I'm not automatically against, and purely cosmetic or optional stuff is where I think microtransactions belong. I do think the people keeping a game going deserve to get paid for their work; I've subscribed to or bought stuff in free-to-play games I felt deserved it that had the option to do so. But there's such a thing as going too far to shove people towards the store, and in an MMORPG of this design this falls under ""too far"".) A brief search suggests I'm right, I saw mention of it taking around $30 to customize an outfit, but again, I didn't stick around to find out. Dragon Nest's initial customization is just too ridiculously limited for an MMORPG of this game's age and ""up-close, face to face"" design. I mean, it has animated emotes and a command which is specifically labeled as being for flipping the camera around to take a better screenshot of your character... [Edit to FYI: I hit that while standing too close to a zone portal and the game glitched, locking me into snapshot view with no menus and no key command response but not outright frozen. Tabbing out and closing the game program reset it.] To me, Dragon Nest looks like a game that doesn't promote getting attached to an MMORPG character enough to stick around unless you've already spent money on it, but is also built to constantly remind you of the lack of customization you have access to for free. Which feels kind of like asking me to be attached to a paper cutout because it's possible to draw a face on it if I spend money to do so. As noted above, I don't know if the new management plans to change how customization works, or if so, in what ways. I was prepared to let this pass, albeit not happily. Until I ended up with an inventory full of free ""gifts"" for which I hesitate to use the term...The ""free gifts"" currently available ingame are part of what made me curious to play it, which is presumably a part of their purpose. But compared to other MMOs in which a gift item is typically an item, you assign the character who gets it and it's theirs, these are more like ""real-time-limited free first-time rentals"". I opened the mailbox and pending gifts panes and saw realtime expiration timers (meaning: they will expire in that time whether or not I open them, use them, or play the game at all) of about a week to about a month. Timers again on the resulting boxes once accepted, and timers yet again on the items once removed from the boxes... the ones I could even open, that is. One of these boxes required a minimum level 90 to even receive before it would rot, and a couple items from one I could open had a minimum level of 30 to use.I seldom hurry in MMORPGs, I've never attained max level in my first year of playing one. This is down to my playstyle and time spent hanging out with friends or roleplaying with them, as much as to grind factor or time available to play. So the ""fastest MMO"" splash used to tout this game wasn't a selling point for me, and a row of ticking timers in my character's bagspace wasn't encouragement to go play or invite some friends to play with me, it was encouragement not to. Finding mention that to continue having the items from opened ""gifts"" after they expired, I'd have to pay some form of item rent, didn't help. I assume if I didn't get to the required level in time any unopenable boxes would evaporate.Again, I don't know if ""rent"" meant real-money microtransactions or ingame currency, I didn't care enough at that point to find out. I'll tolerate certain kinds of rental in games, too, specifically only AFTER I've had time to learn the game enough to decide if those things are worth investing in. But when I get a gift box as a newbie in a game that I have to level up in a rush in order to open, when I open that box, whatever's inside had better BE a gift: done and dusted, mine from now on. Not a thing with the same timer on it as the box, that's just a disappointment no matter what it is. As a new player I have no real idea whether it's worth investing the time to get and then to rent to keep that stuff. Which I suppose may be part of the point.A required level of level 30 and maybe a month I get in a game that says it's ""fast""-- or I would, if the resulting item didn't evidently expire at the same time the giftbox it came from would have, instead of ""race to get it, but once I have it it's mine"". Maybe it's encouragement to get out there and play and group with people to beat that timer. But rushing to level 90 for something that might then just go away or lock-until-paid anyway? Nope, I don't want aboard this particular hamster wheel.So, after all of that, a row of countdown timers in my character's inventory was what finally made me feel like this game isn't for me. Seems counterproductive for stuff meant to be player bait. I'm sure there's stuff I'm missing about this game, but it just couldn't draw me in long enough for me to want to find out.			"

												So I came up to this hype of me playing again DN (saw my friend on steam playing it) & since I've gotten so quite busy in the past few months or maybe a year. BUT I SAW ITS ALREADY OWNED BY EYEDENTITY ALREADY??! & I THOUGHT THIS IS OWNED BY NEXON! So I was in shock and immediately look for answers in google, like what is happening! THEN I SAW ITS GONE ALREADY!? ITS NOT NEXON SERVER NO MORE! So I was trying to figure out how do I transfer my old account since that account was made on beta like really fresh dn server lvl 24 cap and no need steam at all! Had 9Chars max lv. 3 chars fully geared on lvl80 Legend +10~+12 and I spend like thousand of hours and money on that account if I will count it prolly 5k or more hrs and for sure under $3k over spend nexon cards. BUT THIS THING BREAKS MY HEART! </3 IT WAS LIMITED TIME ONLY FOR TRANSFERS? IT SAYS THEY EMAIL US, FOR US TO KNOW WHATS GOING ON BUT SERIOUSLY NEXON I DIDNT RECIEVE ANY EMAILS OR NEWS FROM YOU! I know this account has less hrs play on DN cause I never use steam when playing it that was so long ago now I check em out and then this really upset my feelings, this is the one of my very best mmorpg games and now vanish like it was nothing? I dont know if I will play again by any means I will start again like seriously you don't have any idea how I grind that account so much. Guess no DN on me no more since I saw some of nexon FAQ's about the DN Server. Wouldn't recommend on those old players like me that will play again especially if you have same experience with me don't think about it time to move on! and for those new and old player that luckily got their account transfered keep nesting! & HAPPY GAMING!
