												The best fishing game I've ever played. Here's the gist, you catch fish, feed the best ones to your pet, he transforms into some type of fantasy inspired killing machine, use him to clear out your next fishing hole, repeat.Now, there is no doubt other ways to approach this game, you can run quests and completely ignore the fishing. It's almost like it's a fully realized action RPG like Diablo, with lots of weapons, armor and items to collect. Which is neat.Still, you are better served by fishing, and letting your pet take care of the action rpg aspect. He'll complete quests for you as you search for your next fishing hole, and run any of the crap that drops from the monsters back to town for you, as you get in some quality angling time!			"

												HOW TO FIX THE ""APPLICATION ERROR"" BUG!Method #11. Open the game directory and set the Compatibilty Mode to Windows XP (Service Pack 3)2. Locate the .dat file named ""default_config.dat"" and open it with Notepad3. Change the setting ""FULLSCREEN"" from ""1"" to ""0"" and save it4. Launch Fate: The Cursed King and it should work fine nowThe only downside is that selecting the Fullscreen option crashes the gameUPDATE - Do NOT select the ""Fullscreen"" option from the settings. It will make the game crash and retrying this method wont make it work anymore.METHOD #2 - Results in a perfect fix but requires downloading some files.1. Head onto reshade.me and download the problem and save it to your desktop2. Extract it onto your desktop (or directory of your choosing) 3. Open the extracted folder and double click on the Mediator.exe file4. On the left hand side, there will be a bar with the world ""Add"" next to it, click on ""Add""5. You will need to navigate to your Fate.exe which is in C: > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > Common > Fate the Cursed King. Click on Fate.exe to add it to ReShade6. Make sure the mode below the bar is set to Direct3D 87. Hit ""Apply"" at the top of the window and close everything out8. Try playing Fate and it should work perfectly fine without and Fullscreen or windowed bugs.Enjoy (Do not credit me for this fix, I just reposted this so more people will see)			"

												I've always have been a big fan of the FATE series. My first ever full fledged PC game (that wasn't educationally intended) Was the original FATE. This, FATE: The Cursed King, is the last installment of the series, and I reccomend playing this one above all the other ones. This series is one of the few where it just keeps getting better by the next installment. Without changing what wasn't broken. If you've played the first, you can easily adapt to this one. While adding new elements as well, and FINALLY having no level cap, this is definately worth your time. Also, if you've played Diablo 2, you'll notice similairties with the inventories.That's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Easily anyone can pick up and play this.You also can get Henchmen, which have three different styles you can make them think. Heal, Defensive, and Offense.Also, like yourself, you have complete control (besides moving them) of them. Spells, items, weapons, inventories...It's all grand. The amount of loot in this game is absurd, as well. Everything from the previous games are here, while also new ones and designs are added. Plus, FIVE. DIFFERENT. INFINITE. DUNGEONS.Also, I've made a guide for the game. It's really only useful if you've never played a FATE game, but It's also the only guide for the game. I've put a decent amount of effort into it- I spent my time to make a guide for this game.

												I call this Diablo Junior. Affectionately. This is a great game. Random levels is a big deal to me. Fishing. Feeding fish to your pet. I feel that if this game didn't have the whole ""cute"" vibe it would be more a lot popular. If you get it for under five bucks it's a steal. It's not a masterpiece but it is fun. Very accessible to younger players too.			"

So far I love the cursed king. It does have some things diffrent new town, new boss's, new quest et...Honestly I like how they set this game up.

												An older game.  I think.....4th in the Fate series.  There's no real class system, which, imho works for this game so you could wind up with a decent summoner who's an expert with a sword/bow/hammer/etc.This game has a virtually limitless amount of levels (character *and* dungeon).What's good:-the price right now is a steal....I spent more money on coffee this week.-lotsa possibilites for how you play your character-AI 'teammates'-It is a diablo/roguelike type of game, and I've always liked those-Single player (see 'What's Bad' below)What's bad:-Gets a bit repetative after a while-Getting better gear means you have to either grind for the attribute level and/or gold and Fame level or use a cheat code-No multiplayer that I'm aware of (see 'What's Good' above)-The Fishing aspect is.....just....so....painfully monotonous.  Same prob. in Torchlight.  I just buy the damn fish I want from the random fish vendor.A bit of helpful info here:https://wildtangentfansite.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=211Some cheat codes for the impatient here:  http://www.ign.com/cheats/games/fate-the-cursed-king-pc-107783 "

												I am huge fan of FATE, and played it when it first came on Wildgames, and as a matter of fact, I still do, for years I have, I have done all there is to know about FATE. I know every combination, and have beaten all the diffiulties, if STeam kepts track of my hours, it would be in the thousands, no joke. But when I found out it was on STeam, I just had to buy it, and did. And with cards and achievments, it is just plain awesome!!!Here is why I love FATE so much:~It has endless amounts of fun~Tons of different weapons and armor~Super cheap~Offers thousands of hours of fun~2.1billion dungeon levels (Yeah, its true)~Fishing simulator! (Just a joke, but fishing is super fun, and you can get all sorts of fun and cool things from it!)~Unlimited amount of playability~Unlike other FATES, this has different pet and races choices!~Has bodygaurds you can buy~Game style is nice~Brings back many many memories~Is just plain awesomness!Consider buying FATE instead of Torchlight? I think you should, because FATE offers a lot more, and its game style is the best!Buy it for 50 cents here {LINK REMOVED}https://www♥♥♥♥♥com/fate-the-cursed-king-steam-cd-key-global.html  "

												I played the first Fate game in 2005, when I was only 8 years old. It's truly what got me interested in video games in the first place. Love the first game and love this one too. It holds up to its value enormously. It's worth the full price of $8 and you will easily get this out of it. From Fishing, Fighting, Foraging, and Purchasing, this game has it all. 10/10, would buy again in a heartbeat.			"

												One of my favorite game series. It's not much to look at, but I've put many an hour into the original and second game. It's always fun to play these games, because they were the starters of the RPGs we have today, just with lower quality graphics. Even so, this game has always been highly addicting to me, and I recommend to anyone who just wants a game that'll give them some quests to do in their free time. (I also really enjoyed the add-ins of being able to select a pet other than a cat or dog. The monster designs are also very original.)			"

So in essence this might be the best one in the FATE series!			"

												I struggled with deciding whether to give this an marignal up or down. On one hand, it is what it is, more of the classic FATE gameplay at a very low price. I was a huge fan of Fate 1 and 2 and so I jumped at the chance to grab this. And yes, it delivered on giving me more FATE.Problem is that there really isn't any reason to play this. They haven't updated any of the spells, the graphics haven't advanced at all, the story is non-existant, movement is slow, the skills aren't interesting and even combat seems 'meh'. It all just feels old and tedious. Yeah, killing stuff and finding loot always has an alure, but there are just much better options to spend your time playing.Absolutely everything in this game was just done better in Torchlight 2. If you want to play an amazing ARPG, play that. If you just want to blow some time killing and looting and don't mind playing on an engine from 10 year ago, I suppose this isn't your worst option, just not a great one.			"

												0/10 - Can't browse the caravan and trade among friends.No, but really, this was an epic conclusion to the original FATE series that was launched on WildTangent. Back when this was created in 2011, it had Facebook connectivity where you could send characters, items, etc. to all your friends who also connected F:TCK to Facebook. Oh, those days were good.For any people saying that this is just a knock-off of Torchlight/Torchlight 2, it is because the creator of FATE was ALSO the creator of the Torchlight series. You can think of these games as a predecessor of sorts to the Torchlight series. Both series are amazing, just they both have flaws that one series or another improves on.Another good thing about F:TCK (And the others in the series, for that matter) is that it is easily moddable. Even I, a person with no experience, can get in and mod the game for custom players, pets, weapons, etc. That is something I also enjoy about this series.And the best part about the FATE games is that it wasn't completely new and foreign elelments thrown into the game; they just kept building off what worked, adding more and more content each time. Highly recommend this game to everyone who likes dungeon crawlers. 9.5/10			"

												Ive always loved the Fate games. This is definitely one of my favorite childhood games, I remember bieng in third or fourth grade and me and my brother taking turns on just the demo of the game, and that time held some of the greatest moments of my childhood, and when I was in fifth grade I bought the full game disc with my own money and played that for hours a day, and now to this day I have every Fate game on disc except for this one Cursed King, so when I saw it was on steam, I bought it right away. Gameplay You start off by selecting what difficulty you want the game at and the kind of character you want to be, there are a total of 5 characters, one of them new to the series, and you can customize your looks and name, and then you can choose a pet, two pets are new to the series, and you choose your name for your pet as well. Then, the majority of what you do in the game, is accept quests from different people in town, and go out to the dungeon level, complete it, come back, and get paid. You level up and improve certain skills, you identify rare items you find, you can combine gems and weapons for powerful mixes, you can gamble your money away and hope for a great item, you can fish and cross your fingers for a lucky item, you can collect different cards and redeem them in town for extra skill points, you can find wanders in dungeons that have items for sale, you can find a statue that can give you ancient gems, you can transform your pet into a complete monster just by givin em a fish, you can learn spells that can summon mobs, throw a fireball, heal you, and so much more. This game is the greatest RPG dungeon crawler I have ever played, and topped off on all of that there is steam trading cards and achievements! For only $8 this is an amazing game, and you may consider buying the others in the set as well, as there is different monsters, and different worlds to explore.Whats the differences between previous games and this one?This game has added:-1 more character to play as-2 more pets to choose from-Keys, that unlock different sized chests and have better loot than normal chests-Allies, AI-controlled allies that will fight for you, and you can put on items on them just like you can with yourself and they have skills too, quite a big edition-More spells, not sure how many have been added, but I know the summon tesla spell is new and I remember I few others, I will update the review if I find out-1 more new fish, the tadpole I believe-Tons of more monsters-Tons of more weapons- Different achievements to earn- Different emotes, backgrounds, and trading cards to collect- And of course, I brand new world, with brand new characters in townSo is it worth getting this Fate if you have the last one? Well, there isnt a WHOLE lot added to this new Fate, but there is a few gamechanges aspects like keys and allies, I recommend this game to older Fate players if they are REALLY into Fate, and truly want to expierence all the different titles have to offer.  Final Judgement: 8.5/10  Fate: The Cursed King, is a great addition to all of the titles. The core gameplay might seem repetative to some, but there is so many features players can play into, like names of items, and all of the spells, and fishing, and identifying items, and Tarot cards, and so much more. If you like RPGs, or like Dungeon Crawlers, you want to pick up this game right now, its a great edition to your steam library and for only 8 bucks you might even consider picking up some of the earlier titles :)			"

												DISCLAIMER: I AM PROBABLY THE BIGGEST FATE NERD OUTTA ALL Y'ALL. GET OUTTA HERE, FATE'S MY TERRITORY M80. jk plox no kill. But seriously, I have played all 4 FATE games, so I do know what I am talking about.Now that I am almost done with the game, I can talk about this game more. So let's go.As a long time fan of FATE in general, I have to say this is the best game of them all. Hands down. There are just so many things to do in this game. Not to mention the improvements from the original to where we are now with FATE:TCK. It took me around 5 hours to beat the original FATE, and my character was level 12.Well...IT TOOK ME ALMOST 8-9 HOURS EXTRA TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE I AM NOW!!!!Thank you WildTangent! Games that ACTUALLY TAKE EFFORT TO BEAT are awesome, espicially when it's an RPG. Love you guys! No homo though.The character I have in TCK is Level 50, with much better gear, not because I wanted to, but because it was required. The monsters I am fighting now are from level 75-85, which is insane. I get one banged sometimes even though I have good stuff, and thats what I call challenging.There are also allies. Allies, you say? What the hell are those? Well, young or old or middle aged person, I will tell you. They are AI controlled allies that can be unlocked when you reach the levels 10, 20, and 30. They will each get EXP and Fame individually, which is great. You can also fully equip them! Even better. (The AI isn't that good though, they just attack whatever you attack) However, you can change the stances that your allies go into. Agro (red lightning bolt) is where they charge foward at enemies, no questions asked. Supportive (orange shield) is where they stay relatively close to you, but they don't stay on your♥♥♥♥♥the whole time. They will attack enemies. And finally passive (blue heart) which is the best one by far.This makes your ally....just sit next to you like that one clingy chick in your high school class who wont leave you the hell alone. They don't attack anything either while in this stance. SO WHATS THE DAMN POINT WILDTANGENT?????There's fishing, too. Which is a get rich quick strat for beginners, and has basically become a meme in the FATE community.PRO TIP: BUY A FISHING POLE AND FISH A WHOLE CRAPTON IN TOWN WHEN STARTING A NEW GAME. YOUR GOLD VALUE FROM SELLING ITEMS SHOULD SKYROCKET.There's a new story, new dungeons, new pets, new music, new armor, spells, and weapons, and basically new everything.Anyway, FATE TCK is the best game in the series by far, and my favorite game on Steam overall. Definetely worth the buy. Good game.			"

												I still remember playing the first FATE on a potato and got furstrated because the free trial ended.Recommend this game because it has probably the most immersive customisation you can have in a game. Besides, this game is very relaxing and you can progress on your own pace without restrictions.Pros:- Featuring large customisation options including: helmets, bodyarmor, belt, gloves, boots, rings, necklaces, cloaks and more.- The game got an abundent of loots like gems and relics, which you can equip it on your equipements or weapons.- Large selections of weapons and shields that divides into many different tiers and types.- A pet system and fishing system. Feed the fish to your pets and they can transform to powerful creatures.- Mercenary system where you hired NPC with random stats and equipements to fight with you, they can levelup and you can give them better equipments as well.- Fame system, higher fame access to better service.- Immersive spells options and stats system. Different stats gives you different advantages over certain situations.- Featuring many dungeons and every dungeons has hundreds of levels to explore = long playtime.Cons:- Although you encounter differnet enemies, dungeons can be repetitive.- It's furstrating to grind for money and legendary loots at high level. - Most quests are pretty boring, involving fetching certain items or killing certain bosses.Conclusion: Highly recommended, I'd give it a 8.5/10			"

												★★★★★★★☆☆☆7/10 It's an alright game for an RPG. The only downfalls for me was at first it took a little work around to get the game to launch properly. The game itself is fairly simplistic and easy to understand-leisurely gameplay. All in all though it's a fun game.			"

												A fun little RPG that have you on your seat for hours of gameplay. This game does not take place in the town of Grove, but in the new setting, the town of Ekbatan. You play as a person who accidently unleashed the greatest foe the town of Ekbatan has seen, and must save the city from their eternal doom.			"

												I've been playing FATE even before i've heard of Diablo or Torchlight, so don't worry about the analogies.Returning from all the other games in the series, I feel like the changes are for the worse.As much as it pains me to say it, the main feature, party members, isn't as good as i was led to believe....And multiplayer? What, in FATE? Never. The only things this game brings to the table are just unneccesary hassles and difficulty decreases. Lazy ones.Orbs that heal you and restore your stamina and mana? Really? That's what potions and spells are for.Locked chests? Good luck finding a key. No, seriously. Most of the time keys don't spawn on the floor of the chest, and even if you do manage to find one, the reward isn't worth the trouble you went through.It doesn't stray too far from the realm system to be innovating in any sort of way, and the party members themselves are akin to randomly-generated and AI-controlled humans. And they function a lot like the AI, only they can cast spells if and when they want. Hell, they even have settings for aggression.Try Undiscovered Realms or Traitor Soul, not this.			"

												Hope you like rolling boulders up hills grinding with monotonous combat mechanics, because that's what the FATE games are all about.  Maybe they weren't that bad for their time, but there's no reason to play them anymore (assuming there ever was).  They get old quickly, and there's hardly anything to distinguish them from each other (they're so similar, I have no problem just copying and pasting the same review on each of the three that I own).  Moreover, there's nothing to distinguish them from the more recent Torchlight (not surprising, given that the Runic Games team includes ex-WildTangent devs), except Torchlight is better in every respect: better graphics, better combat, and better performance (despite being developed for Pentium systems, the FATE games still manage to overheat my Core 2 Duo gaming laptop even while running at 800x640 with minimal graphics quality).  Want to play a dungeon crawler?  Play Torchlight.  Already played Torchlight?  You're still probably better off replaying it, or playing its sequel (disclaimer: I have not).  If you really insist on getting a FATE game, I suggest starting with Cursed King, since it at least adds a little more character customization and a much-needed button to quickly swap weapon loadouts.

												Pros:(Honestly, I cannot think of any)Cons: - Twitchy selection mechanics in battle, Even if you click on another named enemy, if they are close to the enemy you are currently attacking, you will not change the target of your attack.- Items do not stack, this includes potions, town scrolls, identification scrolls etc. With such a limited inventory and the fact that the FATE series is a hack and slash type game series one would think they would've figured out that that simply does not work all that well for that particular game type. In time you will learn town portal and identifaction spells, sure, but that does not make the lack of item stacking any more forgivable. - There is a limited number of quick use potion slots, they too will not stack your potions.- Stamina declines rapidly when running/walking at first. You will not regain it unless you make your character stop dead and then start walking again.- Audio in general is off-putting and the BMG is really just very dull. - Item selection is made awkward by the fact that you at no point is told what the different colour codes stand for. Meaning you're left to assume which colour code is superior using the generic system of white being the worst then increasing to green, then blue, purple and so on upwards. This is not viable considering this game series appears to be targeted at newer players considering the very simple mechanics of the game.- Poor graphics. I am willing to grant that there is a certain charm in using classical graphical design styles, but the problems with them remain the same as they always were: it is difficult to really notice what is going on. Shading is poor, graphics overlap when there are enemies storming at you and all attacking you at once.  I agree that graphics does not make a game, and a game is not made bad from having bad graphics, but when so many other things are lacking in this game I am left wondering where exactly they put their effors, because it certainly was not put into improving graphics since the last FATE game.-Minimap in town is close to useless as you are expected to navigate your way thrugh the town by looking at a completely white minimap with colour coded NPCs. Yet again the colour code is not revealed to the player, so you'll have to work that out yourself as well. In dungeons you get a set of three different sizes of the minimap. One of which is far too small to navigate by, one of which is too large to navigate by, and one which you can navigate by, but you can barely see your character (a single dot on the minimap).- Although there are many items with specifically generated names making the item unique there appear so far to be very few different looks to the different items, meaning the items are not really special in any way, the developers were just kind enough to add an item name generator into the game.- Interacting with NPCs is a pain. It is slow, cumbersome and overall just insanely annoying. So is selling pet items.- You can only have four available quests at a time despite the fact that there are only four dungeouns and they could just as well be giving you all the quests for one dungeons in one go no matter what floor the quest is on. (there are several floors to each dungeon, and as far as i got it appeared there would be two-three quests per floor of a dungeon. Which is semi-practical i suppose because by then you will have fought through a hoarde of 100 monsters or so by standing still and holding the left mouse button down casting the occasional spell and picked up whatever loot is there to be had and.. your inventory should be brimming with industrial grade crap to sell to the vendor in town.It is strange to me how many people have given this game positive reviews. I can understand the nostalgic thrill of reliving youth by playing games similar to those mixed with the thrill of something new, but let's be perfectly honest, there is nothing new about this. You really don't need to compare this game to the Torchlight or Diablo franchise to realize it's a bad game all in all. That is not necessarily saying the entire franchise of FATE is, but this particular game is just.. no. Not worth it.Game mechanics are poor, so much twitching mixed with the lack of the most basic things that hack and slash games need. Bad audio and graphics mixed with predicatably generated maps and the lack of excitement in the gameplay I would expect from this kind of game. With other games with similar styles of gameplay when i had a hardcore character i sat with my heart in my throat, with this game i was almost begging common mobs to kill my character so I could stop playing as I'd decided so long as that character was alive I was going to progress in an attempt to give this game a chance. Even boss fights are uninteresting and downright dull.			"

												Poorly-designed, poorly-optimized and poorly-implemented Torchlight rip-off.  The UI scales for some resolutions, but stretches in 1080p.  Can't sell from pet inventory to any vendor in town, and the procedurally-generated dungeon levels are laid out haphazardly, forcing a ton of backtracking through empty areas already cleared of monsters just to try to find an (also procedurally-generated) quest target.  Given the release dates, the other FATE games might actually be interesting in their own rights, but after this piece of imitative tripe I can't bring myself to try them.  Letting it run long enough to get one more card, then it's time to play any of the multitude of GOOD ARPGs out there.			"

												Extreeeemly dull ARPG game. Everything is randomly generated. The loot, the levels, the quests. It's like No Mans RPG, but much older and actually worse. After 10h is became apparent that you are only on a constant grind against the RNG. Well, in most ARPG you are, but here there is nothing unique, no motivation, only fight better monsters, find loot, level up, find better monsters, find loot, level up, etc. etc. The story line is completely unimportant. The quests are totally forgettable. Either kill some monster, activate a shrine, fetch animals or ""escort"" some NPC to a certain dungeon level, ovr and over and over. Nothing is unique, nothing keeps you going. 16 levels doen the dungeon everything looks the same. Even on normal difficulty and with a good character the became more or less a potion/charm drinking contest. The allies die constantly, And everything is a mess on screen so it is hard to keep track of what is going on. Also the allies don't seem to level quick enough.Also, sometimes the char just stands there and isn't fighting. Holding the mouse button doesn't snap to a monster. And sometimes you simply can't see what is going on. The controls just feel faulty.Avoid and play something good like the free Path Of Exile.			"

Well yeah the graphics look like they are from 1998, the combat is very repetative and unsatisying and you can only have 1 attack and 1 spell equipped at on time and inventory space is tiny and you have to stop every few foot to palm stuff you your pet to send to town.Give it a god if you get it for free, if not get Torchlight instead, it does the everything thins game does, but does them much much much better.

Racial negation stats & skills with AI controlled. - Underground maps : like Torchlight I, only dungeons within underground maps- Unlimited levels can result to crash if value stored become overflows.- Fully repetitive game : even all features included, illimited levels & dungeons, Fate is very repetitive. But because you'll get better stats/skills/items each time, you'll want to progress.Adding henchmen to help your main is awesome. But this Fate suffer from too many flaws about henchmen. I hope update will improve game and give to henchmen real power they need.If you want to play solo this Fate you can buy it.If you need perfect party within AI controlled you won't get perfect team you want.

It gets to the loading screen and goes halfway through the loading process and then crashes every...single...time. Maybe if someone had the same problem or a fix of this that i could use i would recomend but nothing is comming up and nobody seems to know how to fix this. Give me some options? I really love the original Fate.			"

												This is one of those titles, That one game that just sits in your computer for when you want to sit down and waste some time, get away from everything. - time waster.- Random Items/drops. always nice.- Full custom builds.- Pretty much Infinite, at least you'll never get through everything in the game... but it's there. Game progression is decent... gets harder as you go. - Negative: slow Level progression later on, can get a bit boring sometimes.- Negative: Quests a bit repetitive, One town. But many stage choices.			"

												2014-12-17+ 5 differents worlds with their own quest+ Unlimited character level+ Unlimited number of dungeons (more than 2 billions)+ Fame system : famous mean more rewards (XP, gold, items, quests, stat/skill points)+ Random craft system : add enchantements/sockets randomly, gems system to insert in equipements.+ Pet system : start weak & transform later your pet within temporary or permanent form change using fish food+ Henchmen system (AI controlled) : you can add 3 henchmen to help you but all will start with same stats, skills=0, without racial bonuses. + Fishing system : never be stuck in gold & items fishing on poles (the deeper the better)+ Retirement system : avoid definitively character to restart another with more XP, best items quality+ 5 levels of difficulty : page (casual) --> legend and hardcore+ Main can be shared via Facebook, items can be sold to anothers players via Facebook- Steam cards don't work : even if you play during days, you'll never get any Steam cards- Bad fishing system : many misses when setting hooks, we want to play fighting mobs and not wasting lot of time fishing-- Bad AI controlled henchmen : some spells seem don't work with henchmen like [Group Heal], [Revival], [Remove Poison] even if you define as default their active spell and choose correct state (Agressive, Defense or Passive). Racial negation stats & skills with AI controlled. - Underground maps : like Torchlight I, only dungeons within underground maps- Unlimited levels can result to crash if value stored become overflows.- Fully repetitive game : even all features included, illimited levels & dungeons, Fate is very repetitive. But because you'll get better stats/skills/items each time, you'll want to progress.Adding henchmen to help your main is awesome. But this Fate suffer from too many flaws about henchmen. I hope update will improve game and give to henchmen real power they need.If you want to play solo this Fate you can buy it.If you need perfect party within AI controlled you won't get perfect team you want. You can only add DPS to help you.			"

												I really love this game.  I've been playing the series since the original Fate, unfortunately I'm now plagued by the ""This Game Will Now Close"" application error, which has very few fixes, and not much to be found about on the internet.  So, while I love the game, I wouldn't buy it because it seems to be happening to a lot of people.			"

												You're a dumb kid doing dumb stuff when you venture into a cave unknowingly release a great evil that destroys your town.  Nice job idiot!  Now your stupid self has to go venture into a dungeon to find this evil thing and kill it.Fate: The Cursed King is the fourth and latest edition of Fate, originally created by Travis Baldree who later went on to create the highly-regarded Torchlight series.  This means the game is rather old and it did not release in Nov 2014 as Steam is reporting.  Unlike Fate: Traitor Soul, this does not contain the previous installments of the Fate series.  Cursed King is a top-down dungeon delver featuring you and a companion pet.  You choose between a human, shadow elf, half-orc, cogger, and imp; each starting with specialized weapon and magic skills.  You also get to pick a difficulty level and choose between a pet dog, cat, drone (bee), boar, fox, phoenix, or a frog-like creature called a strider to accompany you on your travels.  You start with 250 gold which can't buy much so Fate regulars know the best starting item to buy is a fishing pole.  By fishing, you can pick up various fish and occasionally weapons and gear.  Three different dungeons await.  You'll start in the Caverns of Living Fire where you can fish in lava.  Go figure.  You'll then have a Haunted Palace and the Crypt of T'Kala to complete.A couple of nice features separate this game from the original Fate.  Firstly, healing orbs are scattered about when you defeat enemies so you don't have to rely on health potions as much.  There are also training dummies to practice your skills on.  You won't see your DPS, but you'll see your damage with each strike to help decide on the best weapons and magic.  Along the way, you can collect cards that you can give to a mystic for bonuses.  The most notable change is being able to hire additional henchmen to accompany you in your travels.  The price seems a little much, at least when you start, but their skills and stats are displayed so you know what your are getting.  You can feed potions to your recruit to heal them and increase their stats as they level up but you also need to equip them with gear.  I've found this works great for a magic build since I can have my pet, recruit and any summoned monsters keep me away from damage while I cast spells.On the negative side, the various merchants and questgivers you deal with are arranged in a giant circle around a lake.  It's a bit of walking to get to the person you need to since they're not as bunched up as they were in the city of Grove.  Also, you'll come across locked chests that will be impossible to open unless you have special keys in your inventory.  Keys are rarely found.  The corridors seem skinnier in this game and it's easy to get stuck if a large chest or an altar is in the way.  The altar in particular can be a source of frustration since may be asked to defend it from attacking monsters.  It's hard to do when you can't get around it.  According to the help file, there seemed to be a way of trading items to other players using a facebook account.  I don't use Facebook, but unless I'm missing something, this feature does not seem to be available in the Steam version.  Aside from increasing the resolution to 1920x1080, the graphics in this game have not changed since the original Fate, released in 2005. If you're looking for the most Fate games for your money, I suggest getting Fate: The Traitor Soul as it also contains Fate: Undiscovered Realms and the original Fate.  I've only played the original Fate, so I don't know how many of the features I listed show up in later games.  If you want the latest and greatest Fate with the improvement I listed, then Fate: The Cursed King is a worthy title on its own merits.			"

												(play time is low because i mainly play in offline mode and by myself)A old and very fun ARPG with a interesting chibi like character design, its actually made by the same company that later became runic games (the team that made Torchlight 1 & 2 :D) and it pretty much follows the same formula as those games with a few differences such as having different races to pick from,enchanced character customization,ifinite radiant quest and did i mention unlimited character level up's? The story is very much like that in TL 1 & 2 (or any ARPG for that matter) its interesting but just really there to give you a reason to kill stuff and get loot, it also follows a core mechanic of TL1 with the ability to retire your character after reaching a certain level and beating the story which allows you to enhance a selected item and pass it down to multiple characters oh and fishing too!Verdict: If you love Torchlight 1 or 2 and you want to play a pre-cursor to that series or just looking for a fun older styled ARPG then definitly pick this game up.

												The FATE series is definitely starting to show its age now.  But if you’re a fan of classic dungeon crawlers or are interested in exploring the history of Diablo-clones, it’s well-worth checking out.  Among other things, it used to be a popular Diablo-clone in its day, attracted a dedicated modding community around it for a number of years.  Plus it might especially interest fans of the Torchlight series, because the different developers behind Diablo II and FATE are also the same people who eventually got together to co-found Runic Games and made Torchlight.  Not only was Torchlight directly influenced by Diablo II in that sense.  But it likewise inherited a lot of features from FATE.  Sure, you could point out that even long before FATE and Torchlight, dungeon crawlers such as Nethack had pets, too.  But FATE was really the first one to introduce pets into the gameplay in a Diablo-type game, and to give them features such as their own inventory interface, so they could carry some of your loot, and at the click of a button be sent to town to cash-it-in for you.  Plus it introduced some other new things to that gameplay too, such as being able to fish for loot at fishing holes scattered throughout the game.  That’s not to mention it also came up with how the user-interfaces look and work for all of those things.  Other than maybe give them a lick of paint and a tweak or two, Torchlight barely changed many of those things at all when it inherited them from FATE.  For better or worse, FATE also influenced Torchlight’s toon-like style.  That conspicuously didn’t come from Diablo II.  And it’s a design-choice which might put off some players at first.  But it can also make FATE a perfect game with which to introduce younger players to Diablo-clones if you have kids.  That certainly proved to be the case in my household when my kid was growing up.Despite how child-friendly and lighthearted FATE might look on its surface, once you get into it, it’s also still quite an expertly made and solid Action-RPG deep-down.  In that respect it’s still a blast to play today, because that well-tuned gameplay it had beneath its surface as a Diablo-clone is still there in an ageless sort of way.   You also needn't worry about having to get the whole FATE series.  The sequels mostly just add some additional content and include previous content in them.  Otherwise they essentially play and feel the same.  I happen to prefer the first FATE game a bit for my own nostalgic reasons.  But you’re good to jump into the series wherever you want.Anyway, the bottom-line is the FATE series might not be for everybody.  But I’d still heartily recommend it to any fans of classic dungeon crawlers and Diablo-clones, young or old. (Note:  This review also replaces a previous review I did for the FATE series.  It was a mixed review just to alert buyers to an issue it used to have being unable to run under Windows 10 for some users, despite trying many popular workarounds to fix that.  But as near as I can tell, it no longer has that issue.  So that means I can finally give FATE its real due with my new review here.  Not only that, but on Steam it also has more resolution-options now than it used to.  So it’s not only fixed, but it’s also improved.  That’s another real plus.)			"
