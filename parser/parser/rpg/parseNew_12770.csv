												Quick review of the game since I just completed it.Overall a 7/10 for me.I'll take a look at the gameplay/combat, graphics, story and miscellaneous things.Gameplay/Combat: (8/10)Since it's a story driven game you will sometimes find yourself in cities going around talking to various people instead of just randomly bashing in the skull of everything you see.The dialogues are well done, whilst the actors look like blinking statues most of the time. One thing that bothered me the most about this is that in some cases cutscenes look like normal dialogue and then you end up skipping the whole cutscene instead of the one line you already read.Combatwise it is a very fun game. You have 4 skilltrees to choose from, while you are able to fully spec about 2-3 of them depending on you enjoying the game or only doing the main missions.The skilltrees are divided as follows:Ares: Highly offensive berserker (focused on dealing damage and regenerating health)Hermes: Offensive trickster (focused on dealing damage and dodging)Apollo: Defensive melee tank (focused on blocking damage and regenerating health)Athena: Offensive ""godpower""-juggler (focused on dealing damage and using skills)Each of the skilltrees provide quite a unique experience after starting the game, whilst you end up with 2-3 skilltrees filled at the end of the game.The combat is intuitive, while the hitboxes of some enemies are constructed in a way that you mostly will push the enemy away rather than hitting them.But the thing that bothered me the most about this were the invisible walls that are immediatly thrown at you as soon as you start a fight. Oh, you see a region more suited to fight these enemies? Nope, invisible wall.Most of them aren't placed that bad and you won't even find them except you really try to run away from the fight.Keep in mind: Best experience is with a gamepad/controller like with every hack and slash game out there. Graphics: (6/10) Yes, I know what you will say know. Oh my god, are you judging the graphics by todays standards while the game was released in 2008? No I don't.Basically the games graphics for todays standards are poop. For the standards of 2008 they are ok and it is still enjoyable today.Although a big minus is that the only actual graphics setting that it has is the ability to change its resolution.In the game you will also find a lot of things that will kill immersion. Like guards opening gates by touching them rather than pulling a lever or at least pushing some kind of button.Then the games regions are sometimes divided by gates that take a very long time to open. I don't know if it's an intentional ""interactive"" loading screen or just there to annoy the player.Also some walls have very odd hitboxes, so you'll sometimes be caught on corners or can't get somewhere where you actually should be able to get to (nothing gamebreaking). Same thing applies to nearly every npc you'll encounter.Story: (7/10) I won't include any spoilers here, but some hints to what it is about. So don't read this part if you don't want to know anything about it.The game is pretty straightforward when it comes to the story. As you probably can see from the screenshots it is inspired by the greek mythology, although not at all accurate.There is one twist in it and it really is predictable.It's your standard ""perfect world - oh here's a villain - rescue your girl - be happy and marry her while you forget everyone that died for it"".Miscellaneous stuff: (No rating here) Here just some stuff I noticed while playing.You can add 2 followers to your group. You'll have 4 available in total.There are no collectibles except for armor and weapons you'll eventually find while progressing in the story.Your dialogue choices don't matter.You will get overpowered at some point. The difficulty curve is just ridiculous.Gameplay adds up to about 8-12 hours. Maybe rushing through it can be even quicker.All in all I'd recommend this game to everyone that likes a pretty standard hack and slash game with a pretty standard story inspired by the greek mythology. I certainly had my fun and I'd buy it again.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up so other people can see it too.			"

												Rise of the Argonauts Review General Score : 7/10 Worth playing ? : YesReplay value : Yes, but not for me.  Be warned that I played the whole game using a gamepad, and I do not consider any other way to play such games if not with an xbox controller or game pad. On the combat part of the game, because of this, your mileage may vary in contrast to mine. Perfect example of one good game, that is a victim of it's own ambitions, but at least for me, this time, it is a positive thing. Sometimes you can use Metacritic as a external support for your own conclusions: Critic score:59 User score:7.2 You know why ??, because many of the players that reviewed the game on Metacritic and myself ,had the balls to hold up and finish the game, not like  those ""critics"" that gave the game a 59. Let aside the ""twists"" developers did on Greek mythology to build up the game, it excels on the story itself, voice acting and companions.The message of humility, courage, wisdom, discipline and justice (Athena's virtues) spread all along the game's story, combined with other's Greek gods good and bad virtues, is just a great teaching for everyone. Hell,close to the ending of the game, developers even let you go over Greek mythology on the creation of the world  and all living things.Through all the game, I was amazed how the selfish and particular desire of Jason (to revive his dead wife) was coped , mixed and contrasted with all this mythology, where serving the others and acting for the greater good above our own desires is the goal.The first 8 hours of the game, I must admit that there is too much of dialog and too little on action. The dialog system is smart, every dialog option you take is tied to a different god,  so it's an alignment system. The way you think, the way you respond to dialogs, aligns you more with one of other Greek god(s). All the deeds you achieve, via combat, quests, achievements or dialogs can be praised to a different god,thus, giving you access to different buffs and abilities trees. First 8 hours of the game, this buffs and abilities might no seem much of a change, but later on, it is.I specialized on Athena's (my favorite deity, of all there are) and the lighting - powers I got where an amazing spectacle on combat. Combat pretty much is an arena combat, you get on a closed area, and fight your way out.There are puzzles to be solved both in combat situations, and in normal quest situations.  3 different combat styles, really cool all of them. Sword, Mace and Spear.Amazing usage of the shield ,and the shield charge against enemies to open up defenses. The combat in general is really good, but at the second half of the game , it just rocks the boat. Gods powers on combat are just the ice on the cake. Companions are pretty useless on combat (unless you buff them al lot via skill trees), but all of them have great personality, characterizations and dialogs. You choose 2 of them to go with you , on different places. So first half of the game, gets you into the plot with a lot of dialog, backtracking,some lackluster quests an little combat...... This is where I think most of the people quit playing the game.Second part of the game, just gets better and better until there is no effort in continuing playing the game. I must admit, that I managed to pass the first 6 hours because I like a lot Greek and Roman mythology, and I was thrilled with the game's plot, twists on the Jason story overall and with the general message on the game.The scenarios are great and graphics are OK, besides some half♥♥♥♥♥job on some NPCs.The fact there is no direct access to the map (you have to navigate menus to it) just makes me want to punch someone on the face.

												On the whole this game is definitely worth playing, but there are quite a lot of pretty huge issues with it - the largest being that the mouse sensitivity is up WAY too high, and you can't adjust it, so the camera becomes really hard to control.Don't buy if:-You can't navigate at all without a map-You're not interested at all in Greek mythology (duh)-You'd be upset if Greek mythology was mis-represented (because this definitely doesn't stick to the myths it's based on, but otherwise is a pretty solid plot)-You're easily confused by complex RPG levelling/skill systemsAside from that though, I quite enjoyed this one. The choice element does actually affect the gameplay SOMEWHAT, the plot's well written, the voice acting's reasonable, and there are various different ways you could approach the game without being able to complete it just by button mashing. There are definitely better games out there, but I've also played much, much worse.			"

												GOOD: Interesting setting based on Greek mythology, and an original levelling system whereby you dedicate your accomplishments (completing quests, defeating enemies etc...) to the gods, which gets you points to spend on combat abilities. You also gain the gods favour through dialogue choices, and this helps tie the roleplaying aspect to the combat - if you want to unlock the abilities of war god Ares, it helps to roleplay Jason as aggressive for example.BAD: The game is short and fairly linear; although the dialogue options affect your character development, there is not much choice in how the quests play out, apart from which order you attempt them in. The combat is also pretty simple and gets a bit repetitive by the end. Finally, if you know anything about the actual Greek myths, you may be disappointed with the games interpretation/butchering of them!UGLY: This game has a lot of bugs, i had CTD's (though there are fixes on the discussion page that helped) and problems with the audio; weird distortions and sometimes it would cut out temporarily (make sure subtitles are ON!)Overall i enjoyed it, i didn't mind the linearity or simple combat too much, and it has moments of real creativity. Its nothing groundbreaking, but if you can deal with the occasional CTD, for £5 I'd say its worth a shot			"

												Pro: + Atmosphere - Greek mythology is still a rare setting in computer games+ The story is well written (not too suprising though)+ Voice cast is good+ Nice musical scores and overall soundeffects+ Dialogue system comparable to Dragon Age (which I like)+ Battlesystem is fun, play it on highest difficulty otherwise it's really too simple.+ You get attached to your companions+ Easy to grasp Skill system+ Playtime is just right. Not prolonged artificially+ Fair autosave systemCons:- Graphics and animations are mediocre at best for todays standard- Choices do not make much of a difference- Buggy piece of software, crashed for me at least once per hour- No keymapping- Skills doesn't make much of a difference- Could use some more enemy types (I recollect 5 or so)- Manual save only creates a backup of the last autosave.Verdict:+ Good game. Definately something for inbetween blockbuster games. "

												The name of this game should be:""Detective Jason and the Argonauts"". In this game, you speak and investigate more than combat for the first some stages. When you reach the 2nd island, the game becomes more exciting with fighting almost everywhere. Your Argonauts are like The Avengers and you can bring 2 members to fight along side with you. One of the greatest game based on Greek Mythology. Give it a chance and be patient. It's Worth your money!			"

												No this is not the best game ever made.The fighting and the upgrade system are not that interesting.The story is forgettable and the game crashes a lot.Yet everything and I mean everything is connected to Greek mythology. The characters and the gods are all brought to life and every character you know is being connected to Jason's story. This results in Jason sailing with Hercules, Achillies, Daedalus, Medusa, Pan, Medea etc all aboard the Argo (and towards Delphi...).A worthwile experience if you like to be constantly surprised by a game when it throws some other part of Greek mythology at you!

												After 14th hours I finally finished this game. I can't said that it was waste of time. After checking average note from revievers on Metacritic (only 59%) I wasn't expecting that this game is greate. I expected something terrible. Luckly, Rise of the Argonauts is not so bad. A lot of people are saing that this game is boring, because most part of the game are dialogues. If this is true, why games like Wolf Among Us ora The Walking Dead are so popular? In this games we have only dialogues. Maybe this game was released too early. Maybe, now, after this boom for ""interactive movies"" notes for this product would be much higher?Of course, I can't say that this game is brilliant. It's not so bad and not so good. Sometimes, during playing I was getting annoyed because some thing:- lack of mini-map - elongation of games by many simillar fights - small number of diffrent enemies.Also, last fight was terrible and strange for me. On the other side we have interesting story, nice music and voice acting. For me this game should receive note simillar to 69/100.So it's a little bit higher than note on Metacritic.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Nice RPG with four perk/bonus trees, dialogues in four ""different"" ways, a lot of people/gods from greek mythology but some in terrible story plots and history. Great voicing (Fred Tatasciore), story about love, resolve, courage and the GOLDEN FLEECE ! Good one.			"

												Long story short: The game is good, it has some minor flaws but overall it's a nice action-adventure you're in for!I'd rate this game somewhere in the area of a strong 7.6 and I do recommend this game.So is this game for you?It is if you're into the theme of ancient greek mythology, enjoy a hack n slash brawler-type gameplay and don't mind a heavy emphasis on story.You'll recognize gameplay style and mechanics from games such as KOTOR, God of War and Mass Effect. A word of warning though, Rise of the Argonauts never really excels in either of the areas it has borrowed its style and mechanics from.For example, the combat is nowhere near as fluid or satisfying as that you experience in God of War. The RPG elements and branching story mechanics is nowhere near as fleshed out as they are in KOTOR or Mass Effect.Don't let that discourage you though, because even though the game doesn't reach the heights of some of its inspiration, what's there is well enough for you to see the journey through to the end. Also the games' setting, theme, story and characters are great and will keep you plenty entertained from start to finish.Oh and I hate even bringing this subject up but I know that for some of you, it really matters a lot. I'm talking about the fact that the game isn't exactly the newest and it does show. At least if you allow yourself to compare it to modern games. Personally I think the visuals of the game are very pleasing and didn't impact my score of the game negatively in any way. With that said I do admit that it doesn't hold the standard of razor-sharp HD standards that we enjoy today. However if you let that get int the way of playing and enjoying this game then I can only say shame on you and may hades claim you!Finally - At the current Steam price of €9 (or your local equivalent), you really can't go wrong with picking this game up.Thanks and I hope you've enjoyed my review ^_^			"

												It is an interesting take on the Greek myths and an excellent action-rpg.  It doesn't retell the stories of the characters we know from the Greek myths, but instead weaves a new tale that showcases those legends.  It's very much the Greek Mythos version of Jade Empire.  You begin the game as King Jason of Iolcus.  He sails the seas on the Argo, a large mechanical ship, and in the course of adventuring acquires new party and crew members (the Argonauts of the title).  Be aware:  the first 20-30 mins of the game is pretty bad, but once you speak to the gods, gain their boons and get to the Argo, the game gets progressively better.As this is an action RPG, almost all of the combat takes place in real-time in set encounters as you travel.  It's very much a button-masher/clicker.  There are no random encounters, there is no strategizing, there is no pausing and giving orders to comrades in arms.  The fighting system isn't too complicated, but the experience and skill system sure is puzzling.  You don't acquire experience points from kills or quests completed, like is typical in RPGs, you instead acquire ""aspects"" by gaining titles that build on your legend (killing X number of enemies, killing in a particular style X number of times, certain dialogue options that appease a specific deity, slaying a particular enemy, etc.) with which you can ""spend"" at shrines by devoting them to one of four deities:  Apollo, Ares, Athena or Hermes.  They each have their own skill tree, and you can choose to devote yourself to just one god, a few, or all.  The game does a poor job of introducing the system and I was at least half way through the game before I realized that I was never going to be able to get the higher level skills in any one deity's skill-tree, because I spent too much on low level skills on all of them.  The game also has ""God Powers"", which was even more confusing - I still have no idea how to use them.The item system is... almost non-existent.  You begin the game with a Shield, Armor, Mace, Sword and Spear.  You will always carry these items.  At certain points in the game you will gain upgrades to one or more of these items.  For instance, you'll get a new Mace that does more damage and/or adds a helpful effect to you or your allies during combat.  Curiously, the game will ask if you want to equip it to replace what you were using.  I have no idea why, the new weapons and armor are always better than the old.  It's very much 'Legend of Zelda' in terms of it's item-leveling.Which, brings me to a potential sore spot for some:  there is no item or inventory system.  There is no going to merchants and buying healing potions, weapons or armor.  There is no vendor system, there is no inventory system, and there is no objectives or journal system.  There is no opening of chests or bashing of barrels to find loot.  There is no looting of corpses, no thieving system, no lock-picking, no spell system, and you will never fire a bow.Because there is no journal or objectives system, you are left to your own wits in the game.  This is problematic, because even that is not enough if you're a completist who wants to finish all the ""quests"".  For instance, on Saria Island I couldn't read the first Herm (monument) when I got ashore.  It wasn't until later on the island that I attained a new party member who could read it.  I figured it could wait and I would read it on my way back to the boat.  I also gained a mission from the god Hermes to perform last rites on a number of deceased.  One of the dead's body was hanging for his crimes and I had to convince a particular NPC to release it, which is a dialogue puzzle I didn't complete before wrapping up a boss fight that propels the story and which made doing those two previously mentioned acts impossible, which meant two titles I could have used to appease the gods were gone too.  *sigh*  Be as thorough as you can, is my advice.While the game is linear and fails at most things RPG-related (no stat numbers to play with, no inventory, etc.), it does have a pretty solid story with lots of dialogue.  In fact, hilariously, some people hated this aspect of it, completely forgetting it's supposed to be an RPG.  Gamespot gave it a poor review, because the ignorant reviewer compared it to 'God of War' and complained there was not nearly enough combat.  That's like comparing apples with grapes and complaining you can't make raisins out of apples.  The dialogue, in fact, is the real high point of the game.  All the best stuff happens in the dialogue.  If you prefer games where mindless button-mashing is all you want, go play 'God of War'.The graphics in this game are beautiful.  The environments are detailed and enjoyable to play in.  The character models are all highly detailed and each has it's particular and unique style.  The characters are, of course, ridiculously sculpted and look like they all came from the He-Man universe.  The graphics won't win any awards today (this game came out in 2008), but just about everything is pleasing to the eye.  The biggest issue I have with this port of the game is that there are no graphic options to scale in the game, except for resolution.  This is disappointing, and frankly lazy.  This runs on the Unreal Engine, which is highly and easily scalable, so there really is no excuse for this. That reminds me, there is also no way to scale your mouse sensitivity.  The mouse is highly sensitive in this game and it took me an hour or so to get a grip on it.  You would be better off with a gamepad, but the controller support seems to be lacking.  It is said to support the Xbox 360 controller though.  The sound design is pretty spot on, and the voice-acting is top-notch.  My two favorite characters in the game are Pan and Achilles.  Pan is articulate and worldly.  Achilles is a narcissist and easily the funniest character in the game.  Be sure to take Achilles with you whenever you can, you won't regret it.There were some bugs in the game:  It once ate my save files, it crashes every once in awhile for no apparent reason, I hit a dialogue glitch with Daedalus (thankfully it didn't break anything), and in one or two instances I completed a fight but had to exit and load up a checkpoint save because a scripting bug prevented me from continuing to the next area (I'm thinking of the end sequence of the game).  The game also sometimes feels wanting:  you gain crew members for the Argo that ultimately feel unused, unnecessary, or just background dressing.Anyway, at the end of the day I would definitely recommend this.  It's not a long game, by RPG standards (10-15 hours), but it is highly entertaining.If you have framerate issues (you can also turn off vsynch in the same file):Go to My Documents/My Games/Rise of the Argonauts/LiquidGame/ConfigOpen the file LiquidEngine.ini (make a backup just to make sure) Change: OnlyStreamInTextures=FALSE into OnlyStreamInTextures=TRUE			"

												This is a fantastic Greek mythology game! As someone who really enjoys Greek mythology, this game was for me! No its not the best game in the world but its still amazing. It may not have the graphics of say Ryse son of Rome but it has twice the length of that game and more then half the price. It is a game that could have easily been better in many ways but it doesn't take away the fact that this is a great people. All the naysers are wrong, this game is great. Its not very hard and is plot heavy but the plot really follows the Greek mythology archtype. Where else will you get to fight along Greek Legends like Hercules or Achilles. For me, this game was perfect, cheep with great gameplay. Don't let the negative nancy's fool you. The game did crash a few times but I've had way worse. I reccomend this game to anyone who, like me, enjoys Greek mythology or likes a game that has great length for a great price!			"

												The game might be interesting if you are looking for an Ancient Greece theme, with all those beautiful bronze weapons and scenarios. We don't have many other options of games in that theme.That said, the game itself has a lot of flaws. The gameplay really disappoints in a lot of aspects, and it's hard to keep you interested untill the end. I really tried to enjoy this game, but unffortunally I can't recommend it. Too much story and too little action. To make things worse, the story STRONGLY diverges from the original tale of the argonauts, and the action part made me have difficult times handling the controls and the camera, so it's hard to have even a little fun.

												Rise of the Argonauts is a great blend of RPG elements and Action.The story itself is an epic tale from Greek Mythology, where a great king seeks to resurrect his lost love with the power of a legendary artifact called the Golden Fleece.The game itself is not really open world, but the levels themselves are very expansive and provide a lot of interesting and memorable characters, as well as multiple ways to go about solving certain quests.You don't receive XP in a certain skill tree for your actions like most other games, but you instead get ""Deeds"" for, well, doing deeds both great and small, and you may dedicate them to one of four gods of your choosing to progress in level with the chosen god.While a lot of people complain about the combat, I don't see what's wrong with it. For those who like powerful swings which crush their enemies, there is the mace, along with Ares, the God of War.Those who prefer their strikes to be quick and deadly are best suited to the spear, favored by the Godess Athena.And those which like to cut through enemies with speed and cunning will take to the sword and the God Hermes.I've seen people put negative reviews because their kills got stolen by their party members. Honestly you'd have to be a fool to not get at least 90% of them, so you'd do well to ignore the reviews made by kids who can't bother to learn the game and how to fight properly.Overall the game is great, I've beaten it 5+ times and it's a gold mine of lore and interesting characters for those who are fans of Greek Mythology.

												Rise of the Argonauts is a game that gets very little notice today. You play as Jason of Iolcus, king of ancient myth, whose wife Alceme is murdered by nefarious assassins. Instead of accepting her death, Jason sets out upon a journey across Greece in search of the one artifact that is reputedly able to reverse death: the Golden Fleece. Unique setting, fair graphics (Unreal 3), average voice-acting, good combat, and a fabulous soundtrack make this a niche classic.After the death of Alceme at the beginning, Jason must venture to several places, looking for clues to the location of the Golden Fleece. Three of these locations – Mycenae, Kythra, and Saria - can be visited in any order, so there is the possibility to take different squad-mates with you depending on where you visit first (you can take two for a party size of three). After everyone has been gathered, you have the location of the Golden Fleece, and proceed linearly to the end of the game. The areas and levels themselves are large, but not very open. Not that there would have been anything gained by a sandbox design; but the levels generally feel narrow and restricted, save for the wide open arenas where the fighting occurs.Rise of the Argonauts takes a serious, dramatic approach to Jason's classic tale. If that sounds like there is a lot of dialog in Rise of the Argonauts, there is. Everyone has conversation – and frequently, after finishing one discussion, you'll proceed to the next checkpoint only to have another conversation. There are branching dialog trees, and a few differing outcomes. But one place where Rise of the Argonauts falls beneath the others is in the quality of the voice-acting. It is serviceable, but not much else.The combat is swift and fun, and will leave you wishing for more. Jason keeps his shield, and can choose from a sword, spear, or mace. Slow-motion finishing moves abound. Enemies tend to be easy once you've mastered dodge and block. Each of the upgrade trees “honors” a different Greek god, and your combat develops in the manner your favored  god prefers. I choose Hermes for most of my upgrades, resulting in quick, active combat that favors the sword and allowed Jason to call down lightning strikes and great winds as he fought and dispatched enemies. Ares, Apollo and Athena each have their own styles, buffs and debuffs. Find the right balance, and combat can almost be too easy. Until you get to the boss battles, that is. Enjoy slicing and dicing the minor minions of the underworld while you can; there will come a time when you'll have to face  six minotaurs at once – while fighting a boss...Usually the soundtrack gets a passing mention of whether it is good or bad, but the music is one of the strongest parts of Rise of the Argonauts. Composer Tyler Bates channeled Troy and Gladiator and crafted a moving and intense score. There is a lot of fun to be had with Rise of the Argonauts if a dialogue-driven hack 'n slash piques your interest (as it did mine). The use of Greek legend provides a great ambiance, and unique ways to upgrade and play give it some replay value, too. An easy game to recommend if you are looking for a change of pace.			"

												I'm a sucker for ancient fables and had to try this game out because of the HumbleBundle. I recommend this game with EXTREME reservations. PROS:It has a good story, along with great voice acting and decent (if dated) graphics. Everything else is between bad and frustratingly bad, and I mean everything. CONS:The camera controls, especially on the final boss, made me realize how far we've come since it was released in 2008. The graphics are decent, but even my up to date PC had some stuttering issues when it loaded new areas. There is zero replay value in this game, unless you REALLY want to max out another skill tree. When you are running around, forget being able to roll, pull a weapon or do anything to break the monotony of each sandaled footfall - THE ONLY THINGS YOU CAN DO ARE RUN AND INTERACT WITH SPECIFIC OBJECTS. There is a LOT of running around in this game. So much running...and the map (at least using a 360 controller) is impossible to access without pausing the game and selecting the right option.The menus are unwieldy and slow and you are forced to use them for everything.There are no hidden items, no treasure chests.The only way to receive new equipment is to play through the dialogue selections correctly, wander into the right place, or simply progress the story. The entire game is on rails. Need to hide out behind a rock? Nope, you can't leave the path. Because you can't draw until there is a threat in front of you I frequently found myself surrounded by enemies before I was armed. That wasn't a problem because of my next point - WAY too easy. Anyone who wasn't a boss died by the truckload, leaving behind nothing because there are no items to pick up. The deaths were brutal and each weapon had at least two different ones but after the first chapter I'd seen them all.Too few types of enemies and again, I'd seen them all except the bosses by the end of the first level.tl:dr - Good story hack 'n slash with very little customization, replayability, or variety. Basically, if you want to see a slight twist on the story of the Argonauts you should check it out. If not, don't bother downloading all 12gb and thank me later.			"

												All-in-all, this is a decent game. It's not really breaking any new ground, but the story is nice, the setting is refreshing, the gameplay is solid and I did have fun while playing it. I'd say it is well worth the $10 price tag. If it's on sale, it's a no-brainer, just buy it. "

												I'm giving it a positive review but there's some huge issues about it. The positive review is there mostly because I think it's worth playing at least once.I.Form a.Graphics For a 2008 game, it's not that bad, of course the backgrounds are sometimes covered with a weird texture and most of NPC look awful but when it comes to the main characters, the cities or the equipment,they really looking good. I spent hours fascinated by the face of ""Jason"" the main character, the expressions he has on his face when he talks make him so human. We have the same treatment for most of the main characters. The cities are amazing, you can see they wanted to give an ""epic"" ancient greek background and for most of the game it's actually a success. However, the port of the game from the console version makes it a really bad-optimized game and if you don't have a good computer you're going to endure lags and slowing down because there's NO MENU for the graphics settings, the resolution and such. The game looks good but at a price. b.Music and Voice Acting This is actually the best part of Rise of the Argonauts. The music is just fascinating, they tried to keep that ""epic ancient greek atmosphere"" but sometimes they add variations of other kind of musics like a tribal kind of sound when they arrive in a jungle or some dramatic chants when you arrive in ruins and/or dramatic part of the story. Voice acting is amazing, Jason is voiced by the incredible Brian Bloom (that is known for roles like Varric Tethras in dragon age and other series like COD or Silent Hill) that delivers a really convincing Jason that can deliver motivational speechs that gives you chills. You can also find Dave Fennoy (Lee Everett, Blue beard...) is the minor role of Daedalus. Overhall all the voicing of the game is good except for some NPC woman that just sound completly out of it.II.Content a.Gameplay Here's the worst part in my opinion. The gameplay could be devided in two phases, the first is exploring, talking, walking around the islands and solve people problems with a weel of choices. That weel of choices are based on four gods, Ares (violent, brutal), Hermes (Cunning, Sarcasm) Apollo (Kind, true) and Athena (Justice, serious), you will spend most of the time doing that. Each time you choose a perticular god answer, you gain favor for that god that can be use in a Skill tree, each skill tree offer bonuses for one weapon and gods power. Ares offers bonuses for the Maces, Hermes for the swords, Athena for the spears and Apollo for your shield. You can also gain favor by finishing quest and or killing a certain amount of enemy, once you did that you earn a title, you can then dedicate that title to one of the four gods and receive favor for that god. You can see all the titles that you can have in the ""stars"" map, each constellation is composed of stars that are lighten when you complete the task they ask. It's not a bad system at all but it could have been improve in a lots of ways.Anyway, what is really worse in my opinion is the combat system. It's just terrible. Sometimes you just have to mash the heavy attack button and execute your foe and sometimes, your spear just touch them and do nothing, when you're hit, your character falls in a awful way like no human could even do. The boss battles are just not that good, overall the combat is terrible and sometimes during the playthough I wanted fights so bad because I didn't had one in about an hour and then I get to the fights and wished they were over already, it's just weird whatever the weapon you choose. Also boss battle tried to use unique mecanics that no other foe use in the game and sometimes you just have to think to defeat them and it's good but sometimes it just make things worse. There's in the game, a boss that project ghost and that you need to reach to kill, once you hurt him enough he send you back to the start and you need to repeat, but the game combat system is so weird that when he shakes the ground to send you back at the start, your character fall like a lifeless pupett and even if you mash the button to get up he stays on the floor for a long time and get hit by ghosts that the enemy send without being able to move or defend himself it's horrible. Also Jason is not alone in his quest, you can recruit argonauts, what I thought would be amazing from the start, before I realize you recruit only 4 argonauts (like the 4 gods) in the whole game and it's a bit sad. I will come back to it in the writting section but I needed to mention them because you fight with them. Well the AI is not that smart but it's not annoying in the game except when you get to a particular place in the game where you need to kill the enemy out of the waters and that your two allies will always stay in the middle of the water no matter what. It's also a bit sad you can't equip or change in anyway the argonauts, I would have love to see Hercules change clothes since he stayed dirty with mud on him the whole game but it's okay.Jason can collect five of each type of weapon and armor, each with some power on them, it's interesting but personnaly I just put on him what looked the best. For me the gameplay is a bit of a let down because you need to do a lot of two-way trip, boss fight are not often enjoyable and sadly the game is short, you do the same thing on 5 Island and a special place (Exploring, talking, fighting) and some boss have to be done more than one time. I think the game had so much potential but this make it less good than it should be. b.Writting I saw a lot of people saying ""If you like Mythology, it's a good game for you"", well, not exactly, You can see big names of the mythology but there is a huge reinterpretation of everything.For exemple Pan devoted to Apollo when you know they have some kind of rivalry, or Medusa and Perseus in a weird Brother/Sister plot everything is messed up. Historical Accuracy is messed up too but it's hard to say the game is bad for that, you see, most of the mythological adaptation take liberties, it's like that and the important thing is to see if they hold things together on the run. Well they tried and it's okay, their liberties are huge but the whole thing is okay. A bit sad that the myth of Prometheus and Epimetheus has been a bit altered and Pandora is completely gone of the picture. I'm not going to criticize the choices for the mythology in the game anymore but I will talk about the writting of the story and the characters. The story is simple, Jason is the king of Iolcus lost his wife in a demonic attack, the gods (the four mentioned earlier) want to help him and give him some instruction, Jason takes the sea in the Argo and here it is the begining of the tale of ""Jason and the Argonauts"", You have to go to an Island, do some stuff for a god, go to the other search something until you find the golden fleece like in the legend. You can recruit four Argonauts and use two of them on each Island (when you have the choice and it's not always the case), each Argonauts is enjoyable in his own way, they all have a lot of personnality, however, this is ruined by how short the game is, for exemple one of the character has to discover the outside world but when you get that character, you almost visit nothing with her. That could have been so huge, so big as a secondary quest but instead the game says that everything happen after that. The whole plot of the game is simple but okay, side quest are either well written or forgetable, in any case the writting is not bad (maybe one death that was supposed to be sad but is just rushed since there's not enough talk with that character to get attach to it) III.Othersa.Replay Value Even with the choices, the game is pretty much the same every time you play it, you can choose to kill or spare a few foes but that's all. You can replay the same game and visit			"

												A fun fantasy RPG set in Ancient Greece and follows a quest of King Jason and the Argo crew in search of the Golden Fleece. I was surprised to find out that the game was released back in 2008, considering how good it looks for its time. The story takes you to a number of locations, in which you acquire some new party members and other allies to help you on your quest. 3 of the major locations in the middle part of the game can be done in any order of preference. The gameplay consists of combat sections, exploration sections, and dialogue/role-playing sections.Combat is really well done. You are able to swap between using a mace, a sword, and a spear, and each one has their own combos and special abilities. The special abilities and various passive bonuses are learned from skill progression trees attributed to 4 different Greek deities: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. Overall the feel of combat is very fluid and visceral. Enemies get their heads popped by mace swings or get sliced in half by a sword, and so on. Only thing I wasn't too fond of were the boss fights. They weren't terrible, but most of them were somewhat frustrating and at times even cheap. A few required you to do something very unique and unintuitive, and hence a solution would be unclear.The rest of the game you'd spend exploring the locations and completing quests, some of which are optional, but completing them gains you additional weapon choices or pieces of armour. There are a lot of the dialogue sections in the game where you get to make decisions and choose how you respond. Even if a dialogue choice doesn't have any consequences, it still has an alignment with one of the four deities, and acquiring a certain number of deity-aligned choices nets you a skill point to spend in their skill tree.Overall it's a pretty fun adventure RPG and anyone who likes Greek mythology should give it a try. It does change some of the stories and characters from the myths slightly, but it's still done in a fresh and engaging manner to keep things interesting. I'll recommend this game. It's quite underrated.I've done a 19-part let's play video series on Youtube of me playing the game with live voice commentary in case you're interested to see more of the game:

												Bought this game yesterday since my Steam Library lacked controller friendly RPG's. Managed to finish it in about 12h. I'm surprised I never heard much about the game before. It's by no means a great or even good game but it hits the right spot for someone searching for a game ""like God of War but""(TM) with decent voice acting (great on PAN's side) and a diverse skill point system.In terms of graphics they look good by my standards, and they hold up very well (think Dragon Age Origins). Gameplay-wise, it's the unwanted child of Mass Effect and God-of-War, a jack of all trades - master of none cliche. 3 quaters through the game I edited the config file and set the damage multiplier to zero since there was nothing going on for me with the combat, and I wanted to push forward with the story.As for the story, it's an interesting spin on the Jason and the Argonauts tale (love what they done with Medusa). I'd say the re-inventing of the mythological tale is this game's strong point. Overall I say buy it. I won't change your world, overheat your PC or give you something to talk about in the pub over a few beers. But it's there and it's nice, well worth the ~10 euros it demands.			"

												A thoroughly average but enjoyable action rpg set in ancient Greek mythology. While the narrative takes more than a few liberties with the source material, the result is enjoyable, if cliche'd, and is at least somewhat engaging.The biggest problem with this game is that it's a port from a console title and the camera control really hammers that home. If your prone to camera-movement induced nausea then you may need to skip this title.Another large problem is the game's rather unstable and was crashing a LOT on me during dialog, I suggest disabling the steam overlay for this title as that did seem to reduce the crash-rate down to somethign slightly less hair-tearing.In the end, the title was a fun way to spend a day, but I would likely never replay it.

												Not a bad game  and the very low metascore will not do it proper justice. I love Greek mythology and enjoy Jason's epic as one of my favorite. This game has some spectacular enviroments and some unique character designs and arms. The combat is simple enough and offers a wide varity of play types and felling a foe feels very rewarding. So far, I have enjoyed the dialogue options and having those options have actual worth to the leveling and character combat options is a great change of pace. However, some of the cons are very discouraging. Most of them comes from out of game issues for myself. I am constantly having to save in order to keep my data because the game crashes. Other than that I can't wait to see where this game goes.			"

												Dont believe the current ""mixed"" reviews - this game is AWESOME.  Think God of War'esque with Mass Effect like dialogue, wonderful comedy and great skill tree.  The game is very long at 15+ hours though quite linear, the game mixes up a little depending on your choices you make and has a slight variation on the ending.  Well worth the time spent, will play again after it fades from my mind.Its one of my surprise games Ive ever played.  Definitely would recommend it.			"

												Rise of the Argonauts is a good game, one which has a number of great ideas, but most of them fall a bit short, making the result come just a bit short of being an excellent game, though still a very enjoyable one.I would say the basic idea the devs had was to make a story-driven, hack'n'slash action RPG, and in the end, apart from the RPG part which is great and unique, the other parts are weirdly meshed together and kind of underdevelpoped.Let's start with the story, which tells a slightly modified version of the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts. In this version, Jason's bride Alceme is killed during their wedding, and Jason sets out to find the Golden Fleece in order to bring her back to life. The story is pretty straightforward, and being based on preexisting lore, you can immediately tell what will happen. But the writers manage to keep you invested with a number of interesting characters from Greek mythology whom Jason encounters along the way, and having all the elements you want from a Greek legend. You travel various colorful locations, meet and fight alongside heroes of legend, slay great beasts, and even take part in a philosophical debate(in my opinion, one of the best sections of the game).Combat is your standard action h'n's deal. Light attack, heavy attack, dodge, block, parry. You have three weapons, a sword, a mace and a spear, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and a distinct playstyle. You can switch them on the fly, and over the course of your journey you will find better weapons, even ones blessed by the gods themselves which have special properties. The combat is pretty good, but it is way too easy. Even on hard, the game is ridiculously easy, unless you refuse to level up, in which case it gets boring, not hard, because you lack the damage to kill enemies with more health while being able to dodge all of their attacks.Now, a bit on the RPG elements of the game, its by far best segment. This game has a really unique way of leveling up. Jason is favored by four gods: Ares, Apollo, Hermes and Athena. During conversations, all of your choices are favored by a certain god. Choosing one will grant you favor with that god, and once you accumulate enough favor, you earn an aspect point you can then invest in that god's skill tree. Also, the game keeps track of your deeds, which are a sort of achievements. You can devote these deeds to the gods in exchange for favor. It is a really unique take on XP, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. Also, the skills are varied and interesting, with each god granting you skills and powers which favor a certain playstyle reflective of his or her field of dominion.Having discussed the three main aspect of the mix of genres this game covers, it's time to talk about how they work together, which is a bit...meh. The game's pacing and story/combat balance is really, really bad. There are lengthy sections where you do no combat at all, followed by either a short battle or a long, drawn out sequence of battles where enemies just keep on coming for you to oneshot. The story and combat don't really work together, they seem more like being thrown in together.This is one of those cases where the whole is better than the sum of its parts. Though all of these elements have great ideas but more of an ok execution, and even work to mixed results together, the game as a whole is still really enjoyable. I had a blast with it, and the 12 hours I put in just flew by. Even with the easy combat, and bad pacing, I was never actually bored, and almost burned through it, without even noticing that I had played for that long, which is not something I can say for many other games.Despite its flaws, I would highly recommend the game, especially if you are a fan of Greek mythology. You may not get the greatest of stories, or challenging combat, but you can have a great time, which shows that with fresh ideas, even an ok game can be a great experience.			"

												The game is fun. That's it. Rise of the Argonauts won't have you deeply invested in it's chatacters or storyline. In fact, it may be one of the things that puts you off, as this game changes Greek Mythology quiet a bit (a very small example is that Medusa has a brother in this game, not two sisters) and if you are familiar with the Greek tale of Jason and the Argonauts, you might be left disapointed with the changes in narrative.And yet, I found compeled to see this through to the end. The meaty combat is really what's going to keep you going through all the mediocre dialouge. It's pretty satisfying impaling an enemy with a spear, right before swinging you shield at their face and watching the decapitated head soar away, leavign a bloody spray behind. How did a shield decapitate a foe in full armor, you ask? Well, I say how in the world is there a relic that can restore people from death! It's Ancient Greece, stop taking things so seriously and just go kill more Ionians with that fancy sword of yours!All in all, this is one of the few games I've played recently that I actually find ""fun"". Well worth it if you can pick it up on sale, and trust me: After the first island, the game picks up, I promise! Oh, and grab the mace from the guy who comes yelling at you in the village on the starting island. Don't be like me and expect a peacful way to get it later on. *looks at empty weapon rack and sheds a single tear* Seriously tho, grab the mace, and grab this game too!			"

												Flawed but fascinating.  I didn't expect anything from this game but ended up really enjoying my time with it. Gameplay is most comparable to Jade Empire (real time melee with a party + dialogue wheels) transplanted to Greece; though I do suspect the game to be more linear than traditional crpg fare.  Combat and graphics are somewhat below par but the voice acting and writing made the world sufficiently engaging to carry me through. I especially enjoyed the way it tied skills and dialogue to the mythology rather than to well trodden morality.			"

												This game is actually pretty decent and underrated. It's not a MUST PLAY, but it's certainly worth its price.I've played it for the first time back in 2009 and now I'm replaying the Steam version. The game is a mix between Hack and Slash and RPG, you walk around, talk to some people, choose a few lines of dialogue and slaught a few creatures along the way. By doing all these things you get experience points that you can use to buy new perks for your weapons (sword, mace and spear) and shield.The gameplay is fairly fun and satisfying, although it can get stale at times, especially when the camera decides it doesn't give a damn anymore.I'd say that's the major problem of the game, the camera can be silly at times and there's quite a lot of glitches/crashes (nothing game breaking, as far as I know), so save often.The graphics still hold up pretty well for a 2009 game (better than a couple of 2014 games).The plot is simple and short but it does its job well, it'll hold your attention and give you that ""epic adventure feel"" you're probably looking for.In short, if you're looking for some RPG/Hack&Slash with an epic atmosphere and you don't mind a few glitches here and there, this is the game for you.6.5/10			"

												First the negative points:It is pretty short, I finished in 12h and I guess I took rather long :P  Also fighting is really easy, for 90% of the opponents pressing Y all the time is more than enough, only place you really can de is with the various bosses until you figure out that special wayin which you can beat them and then they are no problem either. Also I would really advice playing with a controller, i didn't really use mouse and keyboard but what I saw of it seemed awfulThat said I really liked the story line (eventhough it doesn't really make sense sometime when you go after the actual Greek legends) and I enjoyed playing it, which for me at least is the main criterion in deciding whether a game is good or not. There could have been some areas of improvement, such as making decisions between the gods more meaningful as well as making the skill tree meaningful (and less confusing) , which it isn't cause it doesn't really matter what you pick since the opponents are so weak.I kinda feel like my review looks really bad, but if you're looking for a casual and easy hack&slash game and you like Greek mythology, I'd definitely recommed it			"

PROS:+ epic adventure feel+ boss fights+ multiple fight styles based on your weapon+ skills treeCONS:- (after a while) repetitive combat with minions- limited customization options in the main menu- more difficult to play with keyboard & mouseComment:I will start off with the note that this game is definitely not for everyone. It is not something you will think about with a nostalgic feeling after years. It is clearly a port to PC and as that has limited video settings which have to be configured in the .ini file. But despite it all the important question to ask yourself when playing a game is - IS IT FUN? And here is why I recommend it as it brought me lots of fun. I played the non-steam version and even though it depicts the Argonaut storyline very loosely you cannot help but get that ""epic quest"" feel here. Henchmen combat is okay but it is the boss fights that really take it. Overall a mediocre game that can be a lot of fun ... if you let it.			"

												This is a game that had great potential. Despite some of the technical faults it manages to deliver an amazing experience.If you like Jade Empire then you will love this game. It is a real Role Playing game, without having Level or XP. You play the role of an Ancient Hero, Figter and King. You find companions, make friends and enemies. Gods offer you powers. You don't simply become 10 times stronger because you killed 100 rats. The improvements are incremental, you can see them and enjoy them.  There are no heal potions or inventory.The combat is really satisfying, focused on melee combos and the strengths and trade-offs of your 3 weapons. The Mace, Spear and Sword. Your shield is always at your side. The other aspect of the game is the dialog. The choices you make affect part of the storyline and is just an opportunity to pick your style without having to overthink the consequences. Just enjoy them. The story is good and the characters develop in a very interesting way. It took me 20 hours to finish the game (one playtrough on Legend), and now that I finished it I want more. I could play easily another 20 hours, another 3-4 cities, another campaign. Unfortunately there is little replay value once you finish it once, but just the fact that I mention this means it was worth the first one. The end-game is simply amazing. When you meet the Oracle of Depli for the second time, make sure you have a free evening because you won't be putting the controller down until the credits roll. Simply not happening. The epilogue is simply incredible.When the game starts the combat feels a bit awkward. That's because of the tutorial and some of the combos being disabled until about the first 40 minutes of gameplay. The game really only starts after you leave the palace. Make sure to keep playing passed this initial phase and not judge the game based on the first 5 minutes of gameplay. Trust me a fantastic experience awaits.The greatest enemy in the game is alas the crashes. The game crashed for me no matter what I tried to do. However I did finish it. Use the checkpoint system to your advantage, a crash can only set you back a few minutes if you make sure to change area after every major cutscene, before you engage in more dialog. One design complain is about the map. The map should be accessible from a single button, and some form of minimap should let you go to your next objective. Finally a special mention to the music of the game composed by Tyler Bates, simply incredible. Check for it online. Do I recommend this game? **** YEAH!			"

												Really nice game over all. It's a bit of a cake walk, i think i only died once in the whole game so i would recommend upping the difficulty for it. Its nice to see a game that plays well, is enjoyable and also gives you a nice history lesson at the same time. I can't really say much in a bad way about it, it is quite a short game taking only a few hours to fully complete, i think if it was more open world that it would been a very good game but as it stands its a good 7-8/10			"

												This game is not the best game in the world and there are a lot of bugs in it which diminish its enjoyability. It is extremely linear and most of the choices it gives you are either illusions or not real choices at all (Example: Dude asks if he can steer your boat. Your options are ""There is no one better"" or ""You earned the right""). That being said it is still a fun game which matters most. The execution moves you use are fun to watch and seeing hercules rip a guy in half is pretty funny. There are only a couple different areas but these different areas each offer their own challenges and are unique. Combat is repititive but the execution moves along with the perks which cause fire and lightning to flash around make it fun despite that fact. Its story fascinated me and kept my interest (which is fortunate because the story/dialouge accounted for 5 out of the 10 hours it took me to play this game).If I had to give it a rating I would give it a 6.5 and would say it was well worth the dollar I payed to buy it.

												A truly colourful story of true love, with beautiful ambience to complement it. The game was filled with loveable things, small details, like where you got to listen to petitions in the throne room, or the fortune telling, outside the palace.A uniqe mix of characters, to travel with, and the moment where you wipe the smirk from Phaedons face, in his own playgroud is pure epic.The spear was the best thing ever, backed by perks from Athena, not even Legend difficulty was a problem. Too bad, you never got to poke Hecate with it.Occasionally the game felt instable, and suffered from performance issues, but overall it was still a very enjoyable game.7.5/10			"

												One of the shorter games I've played. End boss was needlessly dependent on you having decent ranged attack damage. Which I did not.Everything about this game was pretty awkward. Animation, conversations (kinda bad voice acting), combat, and animations liked to bug out sometimes.It was only playable with a controller, and I am not a fan of controllers.I only recommend this game if you have a controller, spare cash, and a few hours to kill. And if you don't mind a rather linear game.			"

												From the many sub-par to negative reviews that I've seen floating around online of this game, I wasn't really expecting much from this when I played it. But I actually found myself enjoying it from the get go. Sure, for the year of it's release the graphics are at a lower standard than what you would expect, but the story and gameplay more than make up for it's visual (and voice acting) faults. I'd give it a solid 7/10. I recommend if you don't want an overly challenging game that still manages to keep your attention.			"

												For all the bad press this game has received over the years, I personally really enjoy it. While there is much to be desired - not least of all varied facial animations - the story is stellar, the soundtrack is brilliant and the voice acting is wonderfully delivered. Characters are well fleshed out, and the graphics are, if not great, then of adequate quality that they don't become an annoyance. The myths that the game draws on are greatly varied, and while some elements have been changed so much from the original myths that they are unrecognisable, there are plenty of references to Greek myths both well-known and obscure. However, you shouldn't play this game if combat matters too much to you; this game really is one for story-lovers above all.			"

												If a Steam special brought you here and you enjoy anything that harkens back to classical Greek mythology (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized or otherwise) you probably could have done worse. Despite the fact that it's a shorter game I did manage to lose interest a couple of times 5-10 hours in which forced me to restart, so you could safely drop play time to 20 hours as a realistic expectation. Ultimately, the skill system was cluttered and didn't feel all that important as many of the special skills had two major shortcomings. First, none of them felt all that necessary for gameplay, and the mechanics to activate them (at least the active ones) didn't feel natural mapped to the old  d-pad. In my case none of these issues ended up stopping me from watching the credits roll eventually, but I can see why this one didn't catch on with the masses.			"

												The game has a good storyline, but the Greek mythology is very scrambled. Don't expect this to be like a Percy Jackson book in terms of accuracy.There are 3 weapons - sword, mace and spear. The game lets you work out which ones work best where, and there are several (at least 4) different weapons for each slot, as well as armour as well.The god powers are fun, but suffer from being really awkward to actually fire up in combat, since you have to push the button then hold it for a few seconds, and you can only have 4 on ""quick""slots, so if you use more than 4, you have to constantly be swapping out.The combat is good, better than Skyrim's 'click, block, repeat"", but not Kingdom of Amalur standard. The combos are pretty basic when you learn the patterns, and the executions in the game are little more than slowed down hitting people, which is fine by me.The upgrade system is quite different from other games, since you can dedicate deeds ♥♥♥♥♥♥you've done, like ""I mow this lawn in the name of Hermes!"") to gain points to put into upgrades, with each upgrade tree upgrading one of the weapons, or your defense, and giving god powers.The story is short but good, with a nice variety of combats and environments, and a (very small) bit of branching its all very fun. The ending, however, is very abrupt and rather dull, and has a rather rushed feel to it, like the devs were working into the night because the game needed to be put on disks the next day.Overall, there is some potential for replayability, and the game itself is solid but short. 8/10.EDIT: I noticed a few people saying you'll need to navigate without a map, which isn't true, as there is a map in the pause menu for all places. However, its not likely you need it except to remind yourself of your current quests, seeing as most areas are very linear.			"

												This game is an adventure game/action RPG set in ancient Greece in which you play the role of Jason, king and warden of Iolcus under the protection of Zeus himself. That sets the tone for the story. It's definitely a setting in which being a hero actually means something. The game itself is served by serviceable combat mechanics which are pretty common when it comes to hack and slash games at best it will remind you of a game like Kingdoms of Amalur but most of the time you can get by with simply mashing buttons (apart from the boss fights which will require you to study your foe to understand the pattern used by the boss to defeat him or her which is pretty standard gaming practice anyway). Some finishing moves are nice to behold and give a heroic feel to the fights. The game may not look incredibly good for 2017 and some of the textures can be a bit blurry but considering it was released in 2008 it's definitely not terrible and more importantly the art direction is rather solid with some nice touches in the background and a consistent use of assets in environments. Some faces seem to be recycled a bit too much but others really stand out in a good way. Animations are fine but they probably won't keep you up at night either. Foes usually look good and if you're into sandals you will probably like the way the main character looks (before playing this game I had no idea they made bikini armours for guys and Jason clearly likes showing his six pack abs so that may be a plus for the ladies). Voice acting is mostly good and sometimes excellent and the music is simply incredible. It sets the tone and give an epic vibe to the game (which doesn't come as a surprise considering that the composer was responsible for the music for the movie 300 and arguably the music wasn't the worst or the most controversial part). A great soundtrack is an important feature and that's an area in which this game shines. Considering the lack of games set in ancient mythic Greece especially when it comes to games that actually try to tell a story (I've enjoyed Titan Quest but it wasn't for the story) Rise of the Argonauts is an interesting title. It gets even better when it becomes obvious that despite its linearity (the game opens up a bit just like Bioware games in which you can explore several areas in a different sequence) it's actually a pretty good story for any fan of Greek mythology and computer RPGs. Of course the game takes some liberties with the myths and that can be irksome if you're a purist some of these changes annoyed me at first until I came to accept that the game was trying to keep things fresh and after a while I came to terms with that. The name dropping may annoy you and the fact that Achilles was supposed to be a baby at the time when Jason set off for his quest may annoy you just like the fact that some characters have slightly different roles like for instance Medea or even Perseus. In any case the writing is really good and there is plenty of dialogue (probably too much for some players) so it's a game that will require some patience and that may explain why it didn't do so well.What sets the game apart is the way experience is handled. After completing a quest or an achievement you get a deed that you can dedicate to a particular deity which allows you to get some points to buy skills in that god's skill tree. Each skill tree is focused on a different weapon type the mace, the spear, the sword and the shield so there is an incentive in focusing on a particular god. During dialogues you usually have four choices which are symbolized by a different icon so you can pick your lines by following a god's attitude for a particular situation. You have Ares (violent and brutal but straightforward and honest), Athena (mostly the just and sensible one but also the one who goes by the book), Apollo (compassionate, fair and dignified but also sometimes a bit proud) and Hermes (full of guile, mischief but also clever and manipulative). It gives some great flavour to the game. Quests make you feel like your choices actually matter which is good but in the end you're still moving along the main quest so it may be more of an illusion. Still the game offers enough leeway to actually feel less linear than it is and that's something that is really nice. Bottom line it's a good title for CRPG players who thirst for a mythological setting, it's not perfect (some backtracking is involved at times and there isn't much in the way of exploration) but it's much better than what the critics gave it credit for especially if you value the story above the rest. There is a caveat though and that's the fact that the game tends to crash a lot simply because it has to be run on a single core on modern computers. I used to have some pretty regular crashes but the game has been running very smoothly ever since I switched to a single core.			"

												I really enjoyed Rise of the Argonauts. Yes, it's quite easy and not very long, the plot is kind of stupid in places, the loading times disguised as cutscenes (I'm talking to you, gates to the Acropolis of Mycenae) become tedious because there's much running back and forth, and it's not the best looking game out there. Why did I like it then?Well, I'm a sucker for Greek mythology and I think this game gets the atmosphere right. Mostly. Don't get me wrong, the legendary characters, places and stories of old are misplaced, mixed and butchered without remorse, when not completely made up. If you want a more canonical depiction of Greek myths go play Apotheon (seriously, go play it, it's awesome!), this is more like a fanfiction or an alternate reality but still feels Greek and mythological enough.I specially like the god alignment system. Dialog options don't influence the plot but they do influence gameplay because your dialog choices are aligned with one of four deities (Athena, Apollo, Ares and Hermes). Winning their favour by choosing their dialogs or dedicating your deeds (ingame achievements) to them lets you level up in their respective skill trees and unlock different powers and buffs. To me it feels very satisfying to devote yourself to a god (Athena rules and anyone who disagrees will eat my spear), it really gets me immersed.The dialogs and characters are mostly well written. Each of your companions have different personalities, and they interact between them and with the enviroment in different ways (Pan is snarky and will go on about old legends and trivia, Achilles is obnoxious and will brag about being the best fighter ever, and so on). Like Mass Effect, you take your ship (the Argo, a steampunk-ish mechanical Greek galley) to different locations and decide which companions will go ashore with you. Of course it's much more limited and samll than Mass Effect, with only five or six main locations or so, and only four companions to choose from, although you collect a few other characters with whom you can speak while on board the Argo.The combat, although not very tricky, is fluid, fun and bloody, and can get quite spectacular once you start throwing god powers all over the place.Aesthetically, it's good enough. Some of the enviroments look pretty and colorful, like Iolcus palace (I really liked the guards openning the doors for you, I know it's probably there just to hide a loading time but it made me feel like a king and I've seen too many magical self-openning doors in games to appreciate the detail), while others are much more dull and uninspired. The bronze in your armour is shiny and many of the armours and wepons themselves are not too overly fantastical in design, which I like.I haven't experienced crashes or major bugs that I remember, as many reviews say, and I played for several hours at a time. I guess I got lucky. I bough this game on a sale for dirt cheap (1.75 EUR) fearing that it would be awful or crash on me, but I was pleasantly surprised and, after completing it, I woudn't mind having paid more for it.

												Having a degree in ancient history and loving almost all ancient Greek and Roman themed games, shows, etc. this should have been an extremely pleasant experience for me. Far from it. The Mythology is butchered beyond recognition, very little about this game from the story to the sets match the history or the tales. As if this wasn't bad enough, the combat is simplistic and extremely easy. Legendary seems casual, it's hard to die in this game aside from the need to figure out one or two bosses --- and even that is a relatively easy task. Lastly, it's a pretty bad port and poorly optimized. If anything in this game can kill you, it's that.On a positive note, if you find this game seriously on sale ($2.99 or less), the story itself isn't bad (just not faithful to the legend) and as a casual diversion may be mildly entertaining. Under those circumstances I might recommend giving it a whirl, but if you have anything else worthwhile to play avoid it.			"

												This game imho deserves a better rating.Yes it is old. Yes it is to some aspect clumsy. And hell yes I experienced some crashes while playing it. But on the other hand..The story is well written. Its a fictional story based on the greek mythology. (9/10) Hero Development is somewhat shallow for an RPG, but it suits the purpose. (7/10)(Interesting Skillsystem but only a few weapons/armor types)The Fights are entertaining and somewhat challenging on the highest lvl. (8/10)Dunno when I had so much fun, thrusting a spear into an enemy and hurling the corpse over the battlefield. It reminded me of the fight achilles vs hector in troy.Companions are great (9/10) - You get AchillesGraphics are outdated but still acceptable (5/10)All in all I enjoyed this game a lot. If it's for sale or you can grab it for under 10 bucks it's definately worth a shot. "

												This game crashes so much for some reason, combat is boring and repetitive, weapons are not exciting and there are not enough powers avaiable, maps are to large for no quick travel exspecially when you are constantly walking across them back and forth doing missions and by missions i mean passing on messages even though you are a king, yes even the king passes on the messages of peasents. The story line is boring, way to much pointless coversations, the user interface needs work and the port from what i assume is the orignal xbox or a ps1 definatly needs work, its not as bad as some games but still not perfect. Overall bad gameplay, below average graphics, weak storyline, riddle with bugs, lots of repetition. If you want to spend less time playing and more time talking to characters about the gods then this is your game.			"

												Rise of the Argonauts is an action rpg set in ancient Greece.  You play the mythical hero Jason in search of the golden fleece, in an adventure filled with Greek mythology.  The story was entertaining and I enjoyed the recreation of ancient grease, it made the game seem more weighty than the typical fantasy fair, being grounded in earth history.  Gameplay wise it consists of lots of interesting conversations and side quests, as well as typical rock paper scissors combat.  There are several distinct play styles in combat which made for a nice change of pace.  There is plenty of choice in the conversations, but instead of the typically good vs bad vs neutral conversations trees this game basis the conversation topics on different gods.  Each of the 4 gods has a level up tree where you open up new abilities and bluffs, the deeds you complete and conversation choices you makes fills the appropriates God’s tree.  It’s a fresh and different take on conversation and quests and I really enjoyed this aspect of the game.Overall I really enjoyed my time with Jason and his Argonauts.  Unfortunately I can’t recommend this game as during conversations it kept randomly crashing to desktop.  It started periodically at first, and then grew in rate to the point of crashing every few conversations, making the game basically unplayable.  I tried a few of the fixes I found in steam forums and online but none of it solved the crashing.  Overall Rise of the Argonauts is a really great hidden Gem RPG, but it’s very buggy to the point of being unplayable.  A search of the forums in steam will show I am far from the only one with this experience. "

												This game would have been a lot better if there had been more combat. Seriously, only like 1/3 of the game was actual combat, while the rest was just walking around and talking to people, which gets tedious really quickly. Not that the combat was anything spectacular, just your standard hack'n'slash fare, only really, really easy. The enemies spend a lot of the time standing there and letting you attack them, i literally never used the block button. And if you do get down to low health, you can just walk away for a few seconds and your health regenerates. I didn't die until the final boss fight, and that's only because it took me a while to figure out how i was supposed to kill him.The only real positive was the interesting character progression system, where you complete deeds (save a villager, kill X enemies, etc.) and then dedicate those deeds to one of four gods to gain favour with those gods, and gaining enough favour with a specific god grants you a skill point to spend on that god's skill tree, with each god representing a different combat style.The story was OK, but the whole plot of the myth has been completely changed (instead of collecting the Fleece to restore his fathers kingdom, Jason only wants it to resurrect his dead wife) and all the characters are there, but they are completely different from their mythic counterparts, especially Medea, who instead of being a key part of the story, is just another Argonaut.All in all it was a pretty average game, but being a big fan of Greek myth i found it mildly enjoyable, despite being annoyed by the changes from the myth. However, I can't recommend it given how most of the game is spent in boring conversations. If there had been more action, I would recommend it, but sadly, there isn't enough to keep the game interesting.I also encountered frequent crashes at seemingly random points, but I can't say for sure if it's the game or my computer. However given that i can play more recent and far more graphically demanding titles than this, it seems likely that it's the game that's at fault.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game.  It shows so much promise, but for every step forward, it takes 3 steps backwards.First, the game is a beautiful reimagining of the Greek myth of the Argonauts and the Golden Fleece.  The art direction is absolutely gorgeous - the environments are great, your armor and weapons look unique and interesting, and all the characters manage to look ""larger than life"" while still fitting into the game world.  The main characters, that is, because there are only 3 NPC models in this game.  At one point, I was mediating a dispute between three merchants, and they were all the same person.  It really breaks immersion to walk through a city full of clones.The writing is really well done, and the conversation system (where you can pick responses that align with certain gods - like a witty response to appeal to Hermes or an aggressive response for Ares) works very well!  But NPCs converse by stiffly holding the same pose and moving only their mouth, or repeating the same hand motion over and over, which is often distracting, sometimes unsettling.The combat just kinda sucks, really.  I like that you can switch between the Spear, Sword, and Mace, but they all play the same: just wail on your enemy until it dies.  There's not strategy, it's just button mashing.  It's also a real tragedy that there's a finite number of enemies in this game, and it's VERY POSSIBLE for your Argonaut allies to steal enough kills and prevent you from reaching max exp.  So you get these really well crafted characters, but just end up resenting them for stealing your kills.  Plus, the lack of a lock-on systems is BS, I can't count how many times I've whittled an enemy down to kill him with a thrown spear, only to have my character do a 180 and throw it at someone offscreen.  Then one of my allies kills the weakened enemy, because of course.The cherry on the top is that this game is an abysmal port.  Apart from screen resolution, there's no visual settings at all, not even a LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH option.  Plus, frequent crashes to desktop, which are inexcusable in my opinion.It's a little embarrasing.  This game could have been great - like, legitimately great, but they ♥♥♥♥ed it up so bad, I'm kind of amazed actually.  I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't.  Watch a youtube playthrough, though, because the story is pretty grand.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT:  Having played the game to completion, I'm now fully qualified to say this game is absolute trash.Despite all the good things I said about it in my original review, my feelings about the game as the end credits rolled were overwhelmingly negative.  The developer, Liquid Entertainment, should be ashamed of themselves that they took something with so much promise and potential and made it so irredemably terrible.  Whatever good qualities this game has are so thoroughly drenched in filth, it's really not worth a playthrough to experience them.Don't buy this.			"

												Whilst starting on my adventures as 'Jason' the king, I quickly discovered, there lacked any sense of a ""map"" or any directional purpose to where the player is meant to head toward.The action within the game, is indeed quite addictive, with plenty of customizable weapons, armor and even a ""special"" power, if you can call is special that is...I did however, very much so enjoy the fighting scene's and mediocre gore within the game.However from the instant the player can be controlled I noticed a lack of polish and any sort of real 'love' for the game, the animations are ""croppy"", sharp, watching jasons legs look as if he's just started limping constantly.The actual story-line and action sequences are pretty good within the game, if you can grin and bare the laughable animations and pretty shoddy development within the engine, it's pretty addictive.I'd personally only rate this game a 6/10.+Action packed+easy to learn mechanics+addictive storyline-dodgy animations-animations tend to clip-no sort of map or directional purpose.

												I did not like this game at all.... At first glance the only thing that really popped out at me as bad was the controls. Like I had an easier time playing flight simulators with my feet than playing this game with a controller or mouse and keyboard (and yes i've tried both). Secondly, the visuals... Now I know this game is an older title and I didn't expect anything spectacular to begin with but wow was I sorely disappointed with this. Thridly, the story I really did not get into the story nor did I enjoy what I did see. It all just seemed very generic all around with lack luster build up.... Some of you guys may like it, so by all means give it a shot if you think it looks like something that may peak your interests but all I'm saying is that it did not peak mine at all.			"

And other such polishing stuff like this - it's really sad, as the visual and audio seems good, overall.Also, this is one of those games where if you turn off the music it will silence the cutscenes as well. It's great watching several minutes of unskippable cutscenes that offer no access to options, without sound. So, more or less, the music is mandatory.			"

												This game is laughably bad, and not just because it's an obvious port from consoles to PC. Controls are clunky, animations are worse, and there are poorly acted cutscenes, breaking the rare fluidity of Jason cutting people in half, every two minutes. If you're a fan of Greek mythology, this won't do anymore for you than someone who isn't, because the story is post-Odyssey and makes no sense. Then again, I didn't even stick it out far enough to experience the critically lauded skill progression, but I feel like my time is better spent playing any number of other, infinitely better, fantasy RPGs or hack and slashes. If you like hack and slash combat in a historic or fantasy historic setting, try Spartan: Total Warrior instead or God of War.			"

												I wanted to like this game, and for a while, I did. Graphics are good enough (wish they could have more options in the menu--it has no resolution choices, texture detail options, et cetera)--but I reached a crash I couldn't get past, in the literal sense.You have to complete three different 'areas' for the bulk of the game (keeping it vague), and after completing two, the game would crash when I would attempt to go to the third area, every time I tried. It was a shame because I got REALLY attached to this game. I love singleplayer and I like this kind of relatively simple RPG. I enjoyed the gameplay, I enjoyed the combat. But I couldn't find a way to circumvent the crash, so I literally had to look up videos of people beating the game because I couldn't progress.Game: 95%.Technical side: 50%.Another rushed port.			"

												The first heads up I got was absence of a actual graphical fedelity menu.Completely unexceptable in this decade to not feature this. Anyway.Combat is simple, but fluid. Animations arn't always fluid and ends up looking slightly comical as Jason gets his shield stuck inside his chest.Art design is fantastic however.Models are detailed, but lack high quality textures. Some of the charecters models are rather strange however, as Jason appears to be about 8 feet tall compared to his lowly servants. And I'm not even going to mention Hercules.Story and voice acting is simplistic as best.You can tell the voice actors are going through the motions with this one.If you were expecting a mythical epic in the vien of God Of War, you're probably going to be dissapointed.

												This game is great. The fights are hillarious and the dialogs, too. Game crashes from time to time...but that doesn't happen often, so it is okay. Even the autosave function is awesome, since the game saves every 50 meters, it doesn't matter if the game itself crashes from time to time. The story is interesting and at some points really suprising. The beginning is a little boring, since the mainstory isn't really clear. But after you meet the gods and talk to them, the game expends to it true form. There are many skills and weapons you will find, many different enemies you will fight and many dialogs you will have. For an 7 years old game, it is more than just another 08/15 crap game. It is a jewel!If you are a graphic maniac, who needs flawless fighting systems like in God of War or any other hack n slay game, then you are totally wrong with this title. Go buy yourself a console and spend hundreds of Euro/Dollar for your games. If you don't care about these points and just want to enjoy a good RPG game, then give this game a try. I can totally recommend this game for 9€/9$ or even less on sale. Don't believe the bad reviews, since they gave up before giving this game a chance (check gametime).			"

												As the King of Iolcus, Jason had everything—a prosperous kingdom, the respect of his peers, and a beautiful fiancé. When she was killed on their wedding day, he vowed to do anything to restore her life. Now, in order to accomplish this heroic feat Jason must seek out the Golden Fleece -- and with the help of Greek mythology's greatest heroes -- set sail on the most epic voyage of all.A grand scale Action/RPG, Rise of the Argonauts™ immerses players in a gladiatorial adventure set in the vibrant and powerful world of Ancient Greece brought to life. Taking the role of Jason, players will battle alongside Hercules, Achilles and other Argonauts as they engage in brutal combat against formidable beasts and enemies, in a vast world alive with wondrous inhabitants and stunning panoramas. The search for the Golden Fleece is not only one of exploration but of transformation -- from warrior king to exalted hero touched by the gods.			"

												This game's genericness hit me like the giant tidal wave hit Patrick Swayze at the end of Point Break. Unlike him though, I am lucky to escape with my life. It is not even worth saying much about this game, other than Codemasters needs to quit trying to publish other games besides their awesome racing games because every time they do it ends up bad. Their extra studio they opened to make the Operation Flashpoint games closed down because those games sucked so bad, and hopefully the studio that produced this did too. This game was released in 2008 but feels like a game from 2002, and not a good one. Everything about it is bland: the graphics, sound, and especially the combat. God does it ever suck. I mean it works fine, it is just so overwhelmingly generic that it is laughable. You can dodge, shield block, do weapon combos, etc. But none of that is necessary because it is one of those games where realistically if all you do is pound mouse 1 and 2 during combat you will come out on top. But like I said you won't want to because the game is so generic it is like they made is as a joke or something.This deserves even lower than the low meta score it has. It is so bad that its only purpose is to serve as another game owned toward getting my 250+ games badge.If you want games similar to this that are actually good games, try Lord of the Rings War in the North and Game of Thrones. It cost me $1 to find out if this game blew or not, and I quickly found out that the best thing that can be said about it is a physical copy of the game can be used by a hobo to wipe his♥♥♥♥♥with, and a digital copy of this game is good for about 20 minutes of laughs before you uninstall it with a frown and a muttering of ""thank God for the uninstall button"".

												I got the game as part of the Codemasters Humble Weekly Bundle.  I was very excited to play.  Unfortunately, even after 2 hours of troubleshooting and research, I still can only get my character to respond to WASD keys or the left analog stick (and that's inverted) on my Logitech Dual Action gamepad.  None of the other inputs work, either from my keyboard/mouse or the gamepad.  The first level has you blocking arrows... but I can't get Jason to do anything but run around.  I'm not new to PCs... so this is definitely an issue.  So caution to the buyer - I have a Windows 8 64 bit HP Pavillion p7-1414, with the integrated AMD/ATI graphics card.  I am using a USB keyboard, USB optical mouse (both HP brand).  I don't have an X-Box 360 Wired controller, just a Wireless... so that's not an option for me at the moment.  It's a shame because this was the game I wanted to try first.			"

Needless to say, this stops me completing what has been, thus far, a very good game with intricate dialogue choices. That apart, the game was surprisingly better than expected. The favor tree was a very interesting concept, and the conversations with the following characters were quite deep and thought-provoking. The combat system was also very well implemented. The main character is equipped with three weapons at all times - a spear, a mace and a sword, allowing the user to change play styles at any point in the game, in response to the enemy sets that appear.

												A unique experience where in a world of 300 and god of war it gave us a propper greek game. Get on a sale and its certainly worth the cash. Got a good mass effect style story and although combat is kinda samey and the characters might not be on par with mass effect for the price its still good and while the characters might not be deep they are very likable. What is also good is that there is no good or bad, you just follow the tenits of a certain greek god (though whoever follows Ares is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...Even in a traditional greek game he is still as much an♥♥♥♥♥as he was in god of war). The only major issue is there is no graphic setting which won't matter to most but when you have a pc that just staggers a tad to keep up, knowing only a little graphic tweek could make it run perfectly, it is the most fustrating thing in the world! But if you get it cheap, got a good rig, its worth the cash. 7/10 full price, 8.5/10 on sale.			"

												Basically you are doing lots of talking and walking around with some combat mixed in.The combat consists of using three weapons (sword, spear and mace), each with a primary and secondary attack, as well as a special attack. Additionally you can block attacks and bash enemies with your shield. Finally you can dodge attacks and use ""god powers"", which are unlocked through a skill tree.The skill system seems to be the game's most unique aspect. You fulfill deeds, e.g. ""Killed 10 enemies with a sword"" or ""Made 10 choices aligned with Athene"". Each deed is worth a certain amount of XP and can be dedicated to one of four gods (aka skilltrees). With enough experience in one tree, passive skills as well as active ""god powers"" can be unlocked. Reskilling is not possible.Positive PointsGraphics are good.Dialogs and story is decent enough (but not historically correct).Performance is no issue.Loading times are short.Combat is quite enjoyable.Interesting skill system.Negative PointsNo real graphics options whatsoever. They are however available via "".ini""-files.The game frequently (about once an hour) crashes/freezes in random situations.Combined with the checkpoint system (no quick save/load) this can be really annoying.At various places barriers are placed which you have to wait for opening.The game's menu is badly optimized for keyboard/mouse control.SummaryI'm going to finish playing this game, but can only recommend it to players which are not annoyed by its negative aspects.

You play as Jason who sets off with his friends to seek golden fleece - Item that is said to have power to review the dead, which Jason intends to use for her bride who was shot by an arrow during wedding.. Combat is good, like you would expect from an action type of game. You get to fight with 3 different weapons: Spear, Hammer and short sword.

												For a while, I thought that my laptop had decided it didn't want to be a gaming laptop anymore. I had constant frame rate issues, even when I bumped the resolution to 1360x760 or something ridiculous like that (my native res is 1920x1080). After seeing a review on IGN, apparently it's just the game.The combat is awkward to say the least. I was expecting my shield bash move to break the enemies' defenses, but instead, it just bumped them back, which did little to no help since I'd stay in my bashing animation for about as long as they staggered. You apparently have to break their shields with your weapon before you can kill them, which is really lame.You have three weapons, a sword, a spear, and a mace. Just use the special moves on the mace (ground pound) and sword (slice in half) and you're fine.Oh, and the mini-map isn't even in-game. You have to pause and go over to it to look. Good luck with that.			"

												Graphic is a bit dated, the gameplay is okay, story is pretty good and you get to read about greek mythology, but the length of the game is quite short. It's an ok game if you have nothing else to play.			"

												I keep crashing on the last stage of the final boss battle, even after following the instructions mentioned by @DEATH-2-TYRANTS in his/her review. Needless to say, this stops me completing what has been, thus far, a very good game with intricate dialogue choices. That apart, the game was surprisingly better than expected. The favor tree was a very interesting concept, and the conversations with the following characters were quite deep and thought-provoking. The combat system was also very well implemented. The main character is equipped with three weapons at all times - a spear, a mace and a sword, allowing the user to change play styles at any point in the game, in response to the enemy sets that appear.

												Is this the best game in the world? Nah. But it really is a GREAT game. I'm bothered a lot about gameplay getting in the way of the story; that does NOT happen here. The gameplay is quick to pick up and fairly intuitive. There's very little HUD (practically none), and each encounter is carefully planned/placed and makes perfect sense. It never feels like grinding.Storywise, it's a very rich game. If you love Greek mythology you'll have a fun time with how Rise of the Argonauts plays with it. My one complaint is that the story is very ""plain."" There are a few chances to complicate the narrative that are just passed by (the oracle, for instance, clearly switches between the maid, matron, and crone in her speech. Or as the Moirai, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. In either case it was a fun opportunity to make the character a bit more three-dimensional) but by and large this same plainness is done SO WELL that it really works for the game. The graphics are dated, but they work well for the game as a whole. I finished the game at just over 10 hours on normal difficulty. I wasn't a super-completionist (can't be bothered) but I can't imagine it being much longer even if I were. I really only had trouble with a FEW battles but otherwise it was intuitive enough I didn't have to look up help.			"

												Fourteen minutes into the game, and it crashes. Best moment of my life, to be honest.The game isn't very good. Hit detection is off, which is very, very bad for an Action RPG game, not that I made it to the RPG part.I played the game very little, due to the crash, and I honestly don't think it's worth giving another shot.2/10			"

												I don't recommend this game, and here is why: 1. One of the worst pc ports I have ever seen. You can't change anything in game except the resolution. No drawdistance, no texture filtering, nothing else! 2. You can hardly use the mouse in the menu's.3. Combat is very simplistic, left mouse to do a light attack and right mouse to perform an execution strike(WHICH IS JUST AN ATTACK THAT TAKES LONGER TO PERFORM AND DEALS MORE DAMAGE, it only executes soldiers when they are almost dead). The mouse wheel let's you shield bash and the spacebar blocks. All attacks seem the same and, in case you thought you were smart by shield bashing the enemy and then performing a light attack; IT HARDLY EVER WORKS. 4. The ai is stupid, it warns you waaay ahead of time that it is going to attack and it sometimes taunts you meaning you can kill them without any effort at all. 5. The graphics look beyond average, and that is comparing them to other 2008 games. 6. The animations look odd  and you teleport around a room for a cutscene.7. At the begining somebody dies and they want you to care about them but they already spoilerd she was about to die and we know nothing about that person. It is just an other npc.8. THE CAMERA IS AWFULL. It is absurd, it would work just fine on a console but I'didn't spend massive amounts of money on a pc to play a game that was supposed to be played on a console.......I should note that I only played a bit of the first level and are therefore unable to tell you anything about the story.Thank you for reading this, have a nice day!P.S.If you really want to play this game buy it on console or use a pad instead.

												Fun game. It's been hailed as one of the worst games of it's time but I have to disagree. I have played many game way worse than Rise of the Argonauts. The combat is fun, especially later in the game when you start the receive weapons with different powers tagged on. There are spears, swords, and maces (5 of each can be found) and different pieces of armor. There are 4 skill trees to progress into and they are disinctively different. Each one really adds power to Jason and the Argonauts. The story is good and holds your attention for the entire game. There are several different areas to travel to but all of them are linear, as with most 3rd person action RPGs. The graphics are ok for the time this game was released. I'm not big on graphics, so I don't have much to say about the subject. There are dialogue choices to be made when major conversations happen between characters and Jason and the conversations can be swayed by what you say but not much. Overall, good game and i'm glad I didn't listen to my friends and actually played it! For the Argonauts!			"

												The game has its technical issues (Sound bugs out a lot) but it was in overall an enjoyable game.Decent voice acting with a good atmosphere and enviroment/graphics.  The leveling system is a bit unique and was refreshing to use.Only major complaint was that the staged boss fights were terrible, and the combat was a little bit clunky.  That being said the fighting was pretty visceral and the companion AI was decent enough for them to be useful.Definitely worth picking up if you are into greek mythology and action RPGs.  Its one of the few spectacle fighters I find bearable as it doesn't take 10 minutes to kill a single enemy.			"

												While I absolutely loved playing this game on console, (Without knowing how to block through 90% of the game though), putting it on PC was a horrible idea. Without any settings to chance the graphics quality, nor any ability to change the cripplingly high mouse sensitivity, I literally could not get through the first part of the tutorial before I decided it was unplayable. Good game on Console. HORRIBLE game on PC. If you get it, don't get it for PC.			"

												So.... if you want to properly learn the history of Jason and the Argonauts, go and grab yourself a book.If you want to kill some bad guys explode some stuff and watch a somewhat enjoyable story buy it.There are no class system whatsoever, but you get to choose from a lot of special powers and dedicate your deeds to some of the greek Gods.The ending is a bit disappointingly generic, but it's still worth it.

												Once you go to .../Engine/Config/BaseInput.ini and set mouse sensitivity to 10.0 or 15.0 (or whatever suits your best) The game becomes playable.And how playable it is! This is one of the few games that had mehooked from the intro scene. The story is immersive, the voice acting is SUPERB! And most important of all the characters have... well CHARACTER! :DThe movement is a bit wonky but it won't deter you from a great game such as this one. It takes up the story of King Jason, the true and just king of Iolcus, and his search for the golden fleece. But i won't spoil it for you anymore. This game is really worth the purchase.Oh and one more thing...It has talking SATYRS! <3 I know right? BEST GAME EVER. <3			"

That is what I call a incredible let downWhen this game was first released, although it's bad reviews, I decided it worth buying since I've always loved all those ancient Greek histories and nothing was so bad it could ruin those. Well, seems that I was completely wrong since Codemasters did an incredible job ruining everything in this game.Although they've tried to put a ""Mass Effect"" choice system and replicate Greek culture and enviroment they've failed so hard that I'm impressed the designer didn't see it wouldn't work at all. Everything is uninstersting.- Lame character animations;- In the beginning of the game you found Hercules which is only the muscle version of the main character, since they used the exacly same face;- The main focus on this game s being a Brawler but the combat mechanics are really bad and not fluid at all,feels very unconfortable.In case you want to know more about the Argonauts it worth the lecture:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonauts "

												This is more of an action-adventure RPG than a standard RPG.  You don't make any character skill choices or do anything with inventory.  The majority of your time is spent conversing with people and occasionally fighting battles.  So, if you're looking for a good in-depth CRPG, this will not suit your needs.That being said, the story is well done and there is something addicting in solving the issues of the main character.  It's fun, and if you pick it up on the cheap, you will not be unhappy with it, providing you know its limitations.  A solid game.			"

No, just no. ~There's no quest log, so you may want to write down what you're currently on before saving and getting off. ~Graphics are totally not up to date and may not be the bestfor people who have played games such as TERA or anything that doesn't look like it may burn down your house if you plug it in.~GOD SKILLS/ SKILL TREE THEY DON'T TELL YOU WHICH ONES ARE PASSIVE AND WHICH ONES ARE ACTIVE, THIS WAS THE ONLY THING, THAT TRUELYTICKED ME OFF. :C -Pros  (Short & Sweet, I know, I write a lot but this game is unique, To me :D ) ~ Great Story~ Great Characters ~ Lots Of Customization regarding skill tree~ Decisions to make regarding problematic choices ( WIN ! ) ~ Knowledge about gods ( obvious )~ The game is almost like a book that you can choose how you want the dialogue to proceed #Goosebumps Very few people will enjoy this game, I am those of the very few !

 It get's better  Devs tried to introduce you to the action part of the game in hopes of sucking you in. Unfortunately, the combat, while not too dull, leaves much to be desired for. The animations can be weird, dodges are not as exciting, blocking is op (almost indefinite 100% block). The boss fights are even less exciting than normal combat. In short, the first thing they show you isn't what makes this game good.The real jewel of the game is the atmosphere, the level design, the quest/characters/story. Dialogue is well done and voiced by good voice actors.Atmosphere - Every level you are in offers a different feel, and while the graphics aren't great in today' standard they can be quite enjoyable.Story/characters - I really enjoyed the story. It can really keep you engaged and keeps you wondering what will happen next.Dialogue - Voice acting is well done, but what really pleasantly surprised me is that the dialogue with NPC changes almost always after something important happens. Even the less important characters say something differently. What is even more remarkable, is that NPS comment differently depending in which order you accomplished some things. You can really sense they put extra effort in this.All in all, game is fun, not the best out there, but I've no regrets having played it.			"
