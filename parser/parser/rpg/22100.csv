												I started out with a horse.I named it Dipsy.I lost her after a few bandit attacks while I was romaing around the map, and was devestatedSwore to avenge Dipsy. Went to village of peasants and spoke to the elder. Recruited 4 farmers. 2 Hours later all of the bandits are dead across the map and I have 200+ soilders, my own land, 10 bandit slaves who had a part in killing Dipsy, A fortune of money, the hand of a beautiful nordic princess and horses for all of my heroes and some of my troops.All the horses are named Dipsy.We are the Dipsy Rebellion.10/10 would rampage again.

												Mount and Blade is a wonderful game, however there is no point in purchasing this game - not long after this original release, Mount and Blade: Warband came out. It's largely the same game, using the same map and same general mechanics, but with the inclusion of multiplayer and achievements, as well as some general questline/mechanic improvements - it's basically the same game, but more. There's effectively no advantages this original game has over Warband, so it's not really worth purchasing. The one exception to this rule is that there were some mods created for it which did not get ported to Warband, so take a look at those via a Google search to see if one of them might be up your alley.If you're trying to complete your library or support the developer/publisher? By all means. But if you're looking for the game to purchase, pick up Mount and Blade: Warband, instead.			"

												There isn't much point in buying or playing this game anymore as Mount & Blade: Warband is almost the same game but with more polish, some changes/improvements, AND multiplayer. The only reason you should buy or play this version of the game is for the mods that were built for this and not Warband. The most notable being Star Wars: Conquest, which is a total conversion mod for the game that takes the core gameplay elements and replaces the story, setting, characters, mythos, universe, etc with faithful Star Wars content. That mod is what would make me recommend this to people. If you're a fan of Star Wars you NEED to play Star Wars: Conquest, and the only way to do so is with this base game.			"

												I found M&B's mechanics take some geting used, especially combat. Once you develop an understanding of what's going on and what to do, the game really starts to open up. It doesn't help that you start off all alone with a low-level character with no one else in your party. That's the challenge though! Tournaments are a good way to learn the fighting mechanics. Level up by fighting small parties of bandits (a horse makes things loads easier) and recruit villagers to your party, who will also level up. Launch sieges against castles or defend your castles against sieges. Eventually, you get a lordship and maybe even kingship, but I haven't gotten that far yet.			"

												I am actually a little bit relieved that I had the M&B series on CD first, before playing on steam, or I would most likely have over 500-1000 hours spread across the 3 games. I absolutely love this series!Warband is easily the best of the 3 available, with superior mod support, however, the orignal M&B is still very good. If you are able to choose, definitely go with Warhand, which is basically a more fleshed-out version of the original game. While playing the original, I did notice that some of my favorite mods did not get ported over to Warband, so make sure you check out the mod community for M&B to see if anything there interests you.Much of the aesthetics, controls, and gameplay mirror Warband, so here is my review. There usually is only a few dollars difference between M&B and Warband whenever they both go on sale, so be sure to pick up Warband if possible (or both, if you like collecting).Despite the more superior Warband being available, this is still a great game, and you should try it out if you are interested in sampling the series.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Take over castles, kill thousands of men, manage your own army, relations with lords/kings/cities/towns/factions, pillage and burn (looting, my favorite), and a huge map with 5 different factions that you choose to join. You can either be a jerk and chase down peasants and slaughter them, or you can drive bandits out of small towns or stop the enemy lord from pillaging the neighboring town. Be involved in battles for cities or castles with hundreds, maybe even thousands if u want to (i have). Now you have to start off right because i have 1 good character and 3 other bad ones. so dont fool around and get captured by bandits or a mean lord. When you get to my level (which is probably real bad compared to some hardcore mount and blade fan out there), you can battle bandits all by yourself, and just bow them down as they come at you. its a great game with neverending places to capture and people to kill (there's a limit of places, but the people just keep comin! how many babies have to be born with the fact i have killed 35k people)! Worth the money too, trust me, I am a stickler for buying games for any kind of money. This better persuade you to get this, or i will have to send my army of 650 men at you ( would be more troops but they are quite expensive, and i start losing money fast if i go for any more. 112k monies. i do love my money.)

There's nothing in M&B that isn't also in M&B Warband, and the improvements are huge. That said, this game is fantastic and I enjoyed every minute of the 300 hours I spent playing it. I would give it a 9 for 10 (there are flaws in it, after all). Its my favorite game out there, with the very notable exception of Warband. So don't buy this game. But definitely buy Warband.			"

												Do not buy this game - but not for the reason you think!Mount & Blade is a fantastic game, and I've invested many hours in it. The problem lies in it's ""Sequel"". You see, Mount and Blade: Warband is less a sequel, and more just Mount & Blade 1 with more features. Up until a few weeks ago, they were the same price too.There is literally no reason to ever buy Mount & Blade 1, when you should just buy Warband. Just go buy Warband.What's worse, when I bought Mount & Blade, I was given a guarantee that I'd receive free updates for the game forever. They got out of this by abusing a loophole and creating a ""Sequel"" game.In short - M&B is insanely fun. But if you want it, go buy Warband instead.			"

												If you're reading this review, I'm going to assume you're one of two people.1. Someone who has never played a Mount & Blade title before2. Someone who has played Warband, and is wondering if this game is worth gettingIf you've just now found the game on steam and haven't played Warband, I'd recommend buying Warband instead. It's a bit more expensive, but all in all it's a more polished game with some nice new mechanics that doesn't exist in this game.If you've played Warband alot, and really like it, I recommend buying this game. Sure, the gameplay is a bit worse than Warband, so if you want to play Native, I'd just recommend Warband. So why do I recommend it? Mods. Soooo many mods...So, if it's on sale, I'd recommend you getting it, seeing as how many mods there are here that will never come to Warband. If you haven't played Mount & Blade and don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about mods, just buy Warband.I'll give it a positive, even though it's a bit of both negative and positive depending on who you are.			"

												I've got to be honest, the first time I played this game I was disappointed.  The combat, both on horseback and on foot, just felt off.  In addition, there is almost no story.  And the graphics are definitely outdated.  So why the positive review?  This is a game that grows on you, but only if you give it time.  The early stages where you have nothing are frustrating, as you can't do much and are easily defeated.  But if you can weather this period, the game opens up as you build up supplies and equipment and soldiers.  In addition, the combat becomes much more intuitive as you spend time with it.  You are soon able to best larger armies due to your skill level, as well as the quality of your equipment and soldiers.  Unfortunately, it's at this point that the game feels a bit broken.  The whole game revolves around several factions that own various towns and are at war with each other, and you generally align yourself with one of these factions.  No matter how well you equip your crew at this point in the game, you almost always encounter insurmountable odds when you face any of the opposing factions in combat.  For example, you might be limited to a party of 60, but will regularly encounter parties of opposing factions that range from 100-200.  Worse yet, even if you're able to best such a large party, it's almost a given that the opposing faction will have another party or two in the area, each with 100+ soldiers.  It never feels like your faction supports you as much as other factions support them.  In addition, conquering all of a faction's towns seems next to impossible as the towns are dispersed over quite a large area on the map.  While you might conquer several towns in one area, it could take you several in-game days to travel to the next area to conquer that faction's remaining towns.  Meanwhile, those initial towns you conquered have been conquered by one of the game's other factions, as you typically spread yourself thin trying to attack so many areas.  Overall, I know that I've pointed out several flaws with this game so far.  That being said, I feel like these issues don't detract from the game so much overall, as addressing them would make the sequel that much better.  I really enjoyed this game, but a sequel that addressed my issues would be worth a lot of money to me.  This game was good, but I look forward to checking out more from this franchise.  I would give this game a 7.5/10.			"

Just play Warband instead since it's literally the same game but with tons of improvements which makes your gameplay more enjoyable (alone the ""speed up time"" function in Warband makes this game obsolete).

												This game has been succeeded by the Mount & Blade: Warband edition. The Warband edition contains all the content of this release, as well as an entire new faction. This version of the game is graphically inferior and should only be played over the Warband edition of the game if a mod is only available for the old Mount & Blade edition.

												This is a refreshing addition to my library, I don't think i've ever played a game that combines world conquering, FF style over world map mechanics, and third person 'chivalry'-esque middle ages battles before. Quite honestly the whole quest system is a bit of a pain to go and talk to the individual lords in the keeps and cities repeatedly, but once you get to a point where you are powerful enough, you can pretty much choose your allegiance and conquer the world. I would give this an 8.5/10 and if that hasn't sold you on this yet, in the past 3 days i've racked up 12 hours of gameplay, and most of the has been in multiple hour sittings. Overall, this is an interesting play, and everyone should at least try it!			"

												I recently got the older Mount and Blade games on Steam and I have been enjoying playing both of the older games again. While my favorite Mount and blade game is still Warband, its nice to see the roots of the series.Mount and Blade is an RPG, but there is minimal plot, and for the most part its up to you to decide your characters story. Mound and Blade games are very open ended, and have tons of stuff to do. I recommend anyone who likes RPGs try the Mount and Blade games, while there may be some other games like the Mount and Blade games out there, Mount and Blade really did find its niche, and it sure has gotten a lot of fans since then.

												This is a great game by default , and even better considering its mod-ability. The graphics are dated, but that is to be expected of a game released in 2007. However, if you are thinking about buying it, i would recommend you to buy the slightly updated version called ""Mount and Blade Warband"" instead, or even better, buy the collection and get them both + the DLC expansions.Then use them to learn the basics and get ready for the long awaited sequel ""Mount and Blade 2 : Bannerlord"". (don't be fooled by my low playtime, i first got this when it was in beta, then on CD, long before its Steam releas. Same with warband, but then got the collection for the DLC'c and convenience of not needing those CDs anymore)			"

I highly recommend buying the complete M&B pack, because you get the original M&B, Warband, w/ Fire & Sword, and Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband (10/10 best dlc ever).Pros:Great command systemMassive battles!!!Great melee combatEasliy moddableJust about any computer can run itIn-depth archery and throwing weaponsGood variety in weaponsOpen worldVery ReplayableGood trade systemExcellent No QTEs!!! (Other than talking to people)Generally ok AICons:Bad Graphics (Understandable considering the game is old, just saying though)Non-voiced charactersPolearms are super easy to use compared to daggers and swordsOverall, M&B is great. It has few flaws, and the few it suffers from are minor. I recommend buying the Complete Pack to get a better M&B experience.			"

												Before i start my review i enjoyed the game but if your looking for more content and more things to do I would get Mount & Blade warband.. Reason has more things to do, fixed a lot of bugs on mount & blade and a lot more mods. Trust me and go purchase it. Its literally identical than this one..Mount & Blade is a really interesting game. You start off as a nobody and you work your way up, including your army. While you hire people for your army, you must have weapons and food for them. If no food they will leave you.You can do quest by doing small things around town and delievering messages from kings to other kings. You can always siege castles and villages if you want to get supplies.ProsBig battlesAttack villages and castlesNice inventory systemConsbusno multiplayerNot Many mods			"

												Very fun game! It's an open-world game that allows you to raise armies, fight in tournaments, pillage villages, be a robber and take everything away from whomever you choose, be a lord of a castle and much more! It's really worth it if you buy it during a big sale event where it's like 50-75% off. I bought it for $10 just to realize a few days later that it was then on sale.... But yeah anyway this game is totally recommended by me! Hope this review helped!			"

												The game is.. Good. It does not hold a candle, however, to Warband, except when it comes to mods. Mount and Blade has more, and better mods alongside it, allowing for new experiences you can't get in Warband. If, however, you want true Vanilla gameplay, Warband is your better choice. 8/10			"

												Mount&Blade and Mount&Blade: Warband are two of my  favourite games of all time, one of the best experinces you will ever have hands down, I would say the same for Mount&Blade: FIre&Sword, but it is just not as appealing due to the time frame, with gunpowder been introduced.But I would highly suggest getting all three, due to there pure enjoyment, Fantastic games, and it's one of those games you can really get into and feel like you have an importiant role to play.The game by itself is utterly amazing, but has a huge adventige due to the talented modders that make equally amazing changes to the game to give you more challangers, and more roles, and quests and much more.The Game-The Modders, they both go hand in hand to give you the most intense and extroadinary vibe you will ever experince.Do not overlook my playtime, for I played this game long before i ever got it on Steam, I would say i have easly put over 100+ hours into this game alone, not counting The other two :).

												I've been gaming for 30+ years and over that time I've played a lot of games. From my experience, Mount & Blade offers a unique gaming experience. Not quite like anything else I've ever played. There are some similarities to familiar games, such as shades of the Total War series, but stark enough differences that they really cannot be compared. Mount & Blade in my opinion is fairly easy to learn, but does take some skill with action type fighting to be mastered. If you enjoy strategy games with a turn based feel, mixed with real time combat, in a non-linear world; then Mount & Blade may just well be your cup of tea. I was looking for a somewhat decent strategy game that would run on my gutless business laptop and I have to say I was not expecting as good of a game as it turned out to truly be. It's got enough meat in the vanilla campaign to keep most people busy for at least 100 hours I would speculate, though I personally have already invested 200 hours into my first vanilla campaign and can see it dragging out another 100-200 easily. Beyond the vanilla game, there are apparently many mods made for this game as well. Some appear to be quite promising and I will surely be giving at least a few a spin. All in all I would highly recommend this game. I bought it on sale and was skepticle, but having now played it, I would have paid the full price and not felt shorted in any way. Well worth the money imho. + Cheap.+ Very low system requirements - should run well on most machines.+ Time consuming single player campaign (I'm not interested in a game if it can be beaten in less then 48 hours of actual gameplay).+ Easy to learn, yet unique combat system that is both fun and requires skill to master.+ High replayability due to massive amount of community mods available.- AI is not the greatest and can be stomped fight after fight once you learn it's flaws. I'm talking I have decimated a larger opposing army almost by myself. Siege AI is almost worse, you can take any city with 10 men once you have learned their flaws. They don't fare any better trying to take a city from you either. 10 men could hold off thousands if you know what you're doing.OVERALL 9/10 AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANY TRUE STRATEGY FAN.

												It used to be a negative review, for I wasn't seen the need to buy this particular game, when we have Warband. But... it turns out that Warband singleplayer can't be achieved when you're not connected to Internet. So now I see the point to hold this game altogether with Warband. I suggest you to buy the whole bundle, where will be Warband, Napoleonic Wars and Fire'n'Sword.I'm in love with that game, I've bought it triple times. I've spended thousands of hours riding and hacking, over and over. Basic Mount'n'Blade runs even with the very dull PCs, like ones we use in offices, you know - with lame videocard, very short amount of RAM... it all doesn't matter! All you need is some free time (you can't play it during your working time, like some facebook flashgames) and testosterone. Yeah, I repeat - in there you'll be riding your horse and constantly brutally punish whoever gets in your way, in that glorified, one-of-a-kind simulator of medieval mercenary. If you play while connected to the Internet, and have at least a discrete videocard on your PC and 2Gb of RAM - go straight for Warband, which includes this game PLUS gorgeus multiplayer. Plus achievements, trading cards, all of stuff you'd expecting on Steam. But if you suddenly find yourself somewhere in Australia, or just on the farm where you have only outdated laptop from the early 00's... This game is one of the best that you can play out there.Game itself deserves 8.5/10 mark for its uniqueness and impact on the gaming world. Although as a sandbox RPG-like it quickly wears off, as a medieval simulator, it's just keep going. And going. And going. Much like that battery rabbit, or the Civilization game.			"

												This game is AWESOME!!!!I created a character whose father was a thief. After he disappeared whilst I was a wee lass, some tradesman took me in and taught me stuff. I then went on to poach animals for a profit... (This was all in the character creation process!)(Game starts) I rode my horse off into that direction (me thinks West) and came across 5 Looters. They weren't very nice. I wanted more of a challenge with my first real combat, so I threw all of my throwing knives away! (I actually missed. very hard. damn hard.) I spent the next 25 minutes ( I kid you not) trying to run over the little buggers with my horse. Yay!!!My review, or rather my suggestion: Use a freakin' sword!!! Add to your character at a later time the ability/usage of throwing stuff.... *whew*			"

												Very good and well done. What it lacks in Graphics it more than makes up for in gameplay. This game truly shows that gameplay is more important, and will bring a game farther than graphics-hopefully- ever will. Warband (the sequel) is better though, since it is essentially just an expanded game with better graphics (not by much though) I would still recommend this game for mods, but if you're only going to play vanilla, than stick to Warband.

												My First Playthrough:Day 1 - Defeat trainees in close combat at the nearby Training FieldDay 2 - Patiently teach some farmers how to defend themselvesDay 4 - Successfully drive off a bandit attack on the villageDay 5 - Visit other towns and villages to recruit brave soulsDay 7 - Hunt down several bands of Looters for a town GuildDay 8 - Lose many good men in an encounter with Steppe BanditsDay 10 - Safely avoid getting caught in a battle between Swadian and Rhodok armiesDay 11 - Win the tournament of Dhirim despite harsh competitionDay 14 - Barely defeat a well-armed troop of Sea RaidersMount & Blade is a brilliant open world sand-box game that allows players to experience their own unique medieval adventure. Build up your own troop to protect trade caravans, hunt bandits and siege castles. Demonstrate your personal combat skills in tournaments to earn fame and fortune. Raid villages, ambush armies and ransom the leaders of your enemies.Overall, I recommend the game for its well polished free form gameplay, exciting soundtrack and decent graphics. The game has aged well, as reflected in the large number of fan mods available. However, new players may find it better to purchase the Mount & Blade: Warband expansion instead for the updated graphics, additional features and overall improved experience.			"

												Mount & Blade is still considerably fun for a game so old now. After I went through Bungie's Destiny I came back to this Medieval knight simulator. The base game is pretty fun, but what made this game for me was a mod made by the community. If you have this game I would recommend getting the Star Wars Conquest mod if you've burned yourself out on the base game. I can't speak for everyone, but I personaly got my money's worth of entertainment out of the game. However, you should probably buy M&B with Fire and Sword if you are looking at base gameplay alone, as it is the same price.			"

												Where to start with this game? Let's just say, Mount and Blade has given me many hours of a great game and tough battles. This game is what every Strategy/RPG hybrid should look up to. Mount and Blade has a lot of replayability, as akin to its descendant Mount and Blade Warband. The gameplay is great, fun and rewarding. Altough the actual combat is rather clunky in terms of animations, the game is very well developed. All the Mount and Blade series needs now is a game that has a multiplayer/co-op overhead map gamemode (Mount and Blade Bannerlord, I'm looking at you.). Mount and Blade is a really good game, I would recommend it to anyone who is skeptical about genre hybrids. 8/10			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played.  Im not sure what ""hardcore"" gamers consider as playing a game a lot.  But, I docked about 110 hours of this thing in just a week.  Any tips for future players would be: The swadians screw you over the most, the rhodoks are just plain bad, and the Kerghit take way way longer to fight because all they have is horses and they just run around with their sheilds up.  The battle time from fighting Rhodoks may be well under 3 minutes, but fighting Kerghit, a single battle might last up to twenty minutes.  I timed it.  I dont know if I just have the crappiest luck on the planet, but that was how long the battles lasted.  My least favorite faction is still the swadians though.  They are the most annoying.  Play this game, very very very good game.			"

												Mount & Blade- A medieval game that captures the feeling of being a knight pretty well. It's really awesome, especially since it's a open world game. So far things were going for my adventurer, named S9y The Unbeyond. I had a decent party size, was doing quests. Money in my pocket.... Until then I accidentally joined in a war. Now I know what you're thinking...How does someone accidentally join a war?!Well.... You see I had a quest to stop this war with 2 kingdoms, and the only way was to convince the lords to stop fighting... Which of course, didn't work, because the lords' wanted 7200 denars to stop, or you could persuade one of them, at the sacrifice of our friendship. But I wasn't friends with any of them, so to become one of the lords' friend, I did some quests. This was working... Until I got a quest about meeting a spy. I skimmed over it, and accepted not thinking of what this would do. Then as I soon I pressed it, 3 other kingdoms had declared me a enemy.. Even though I went back and declined the quest. So.. I couldn't stop the war, and the time to complete the quest ran out. So now I'm unintentionally in a war, with 3 other kingdoms.Oops.Other than than that, nothing eventful happened. It was really just a typical afternoon. (At least I'm getting paid to fight in this war.) 8/10 Would accidentally war again.			"

It has decent graphics, a complex character skill tree, no set story, an open world map, OH and no fricken wizards or stupid magical influences, just good old steel.If youve been looking for an open world medieval rpg with LEGIT combat, this is your game, no turn based combat, just good timing on your part to make a good kill.

												Mount & Blade is a game that wants to be it all and while the lack of polish makes it fail in a lot of places the solid design behind it all makes it succeed in many more.At it's core Mount & Blade is a hack and slash game, and by that I don't mean one button for light swing, one button for power swing. Using either mouse or keyboard you can select a myriad of different attacks and blocks depending on the weapon you're using as you engage in high intensity melee's with hundreds of opponents.You play the game in two modes, the world map and the battle map. The world map is where you walk your hero across the land, recruit soldiers, buy weapons and goods and find bands of enemies to fight. When you go into battle you are transported onto a procedurally generated battle map where you get you fight your enemies with whatever weapons and soldiers are at your disposal. Although both of these modes are plagued with a number of bugs and rather noticeable lack of polish the core of the fighting remains fun and challenging and makes you forgive the flaws you may encounter.Graphically Mount & Blade is nothing too impressive. It's full of rough edges and flat surfaces and you know it's an indie title when you play it. The sound is similarly lacking and not much to talk about.But despite all it's flaws this is just one of those few rare games that manages to live through a low budget, bad tech and broken features through a strong and simple core mechanic. The fighting is excellent and there are enough mods available to remedy many of the problems on the world map. Although this is a title that will never quite feel like it should be classic it still manages to hold a strong place in your memory.Although this is an excellent game that I throughly enjoyed playing it is not one I would recommend you buy these days simply because the Warband standalone expansion is pretty much just an updated version of this.

												Sank over 80 hours into this game in about two weeks (and not because I was doing nothing else). Pros: Combat system is similar to what I'd been dreaming up to maybe make a mod for a Bethesda game, battles are an epic scale for a game (size can be changed in options, mine's set to 100), realistic enough for immersion, not so realistic as to be frustrating (in general), great arena system, good fief management (though I'm still having trouble making my villages more prosperous, which would probably be easier if I gave it some attention instead of constantly charging into battle, but who cares). Cons: no magic (but three types of projectile, mounted combat, etc. make up for it in my opinion), graphics (not a big deal to me, computer isn't great anyway, and it's an old game, so not surprising), no multiplayer option (though sequels have it and npcs are good enough and more likely to respond to commands if you have authority), can't personally become a monarch or promote vassals (though again, sequels), no real tutorial outside of combat (pointers: hire soldiers before traipsing around bandit-infested territory, don't accept quests with targets deep in enemy territory, etc.). All in all, not too surprising that it's already my 4th-most played game on Steam.			"

												If this game looks good to you, I suggest Mount & Blade: Warband. Warband simply has more features, although this is practically the same game. Warband has a multiplayer, more immersive gameplay and includes the ability to rule your own kingdom; which this lacks. It is simply not a good idea to buy both this and Warband, you will likley be disapointed, unless of course you buy the full collection. So basically my advice is, either buy Warband by itself, or the full collection.			"

												Wonderful open world where you can go where you want and do what you want. You can bring villains to justice(probably one of your first jobs), gain wealth via trade or loose by being robbed. You can join one of the political factions and even marry into nobility. As a consequence you will be given your own fief and can(actually will be expected to) participate in warfare against rivaling factions. Apart from ""regular warfare"" you can hunt down thiefs and bandits and if you don't choose your opponents carefully enough be hunted down by them. :P If you want to you can even compete with others in tournaments.All of this you can get at a really laughable price - I don't know about the prices where you live but it probably costs you less than a package of ... tiny sticks of bad material I am not supposed to mention. :) It's quite old by now but I still like it and have some fond memories of it.Unfortunately it seems to have some issues with more recent Win versions. :(			"

												Medieval action games are rather hard to find. Now you will say:''But Mr. Recommender, there are tons and tons of Medieval action games! Look at Oblivion and Dark Messiah!'' To wich I reply with: ''No you silly people, these games involve a lot of FANTASY!'' Not that that is a bad thing, but sometimes I just want HUMANS doing HUMAN THINGS. Mount and Blade has such a thing going on, but we still get some fantasy. Mongolian raiders, and Vikings can gleefully fight eachother in this game for example. Combat took a bit of time to get used too for me, but once you get better, create your own personal army and join a faction, oh boy all hell can break lose. Beware tough..getting captured is no fun..oh and don't forget to stock up on food..and being able to pay your soldiers..and not upsetting mighty lords..and behaving knightly. You can do pretty much whatever you want, but beware that angry lords will ACTIVELY HUNT YOU DOWN on sight. All in all a great game and one of my all-time favs.			"

												This is kind of a dead game once Warband came out. Honestly, just get Warband. It's the same game with improved mechanics. There were some issues with the original that were smoothed out there. Example are the horses during charges.With that being said, if you purchase this game, you will not be disapointed. It has a historic setting with real factions, kings, Jarls, etc. The graphics are not the best. This isn't a call of duty or battlefield, don't expect it to be. Ever want to be a soldier, a lord, or even a king/queen? Here you go. You recruit an army, raise it, level it, and choose what kind of an army it will be. Want an army full of archers or crossbowmen? Go for it. Or, do you have a passion for the pagan at heart? Than command your army of Nord Huskarls in to battle. It's a game of strategy along with you command your character in to battle with your troops. If you've ever played Kessen, this is kind of like it except remove the feel of turn base aspect in a way. Instead of turn base, when you stop in the map, the game pauses. Once in battle though you can choose to just tell your troops what to do or get involved yourself. Choice is yours. For beginners, it may look like dynasty warriors but don't just rush in lol. It's not how that works here, that's not how any of that works. This game is where you go when you graduate Dyanasty Warriors. Pros:- Character Customization- RPG style leveling- Troop customization (troop type, not look)- Troop leveling based on usage- Quests- No real need to do the quests if you don't want- Be a bandit- Be a lord- Be a ruler (harder than it may seem. All fun and games until the world declares war on you)- Trading (you can live your life here as a merchant trader without ever joining a faction)- Trading (you can either do the normal every day trading OR you can be a manhunterish that takes prisoner of bandits or even villagers and sells them to slave traders or ransom brokers. Slave traders don't care who you sell, ransom brokers are similar but give more money).Cons:- Horse mechanics a little screwy but nothing game breaking.- Warband is out (Do yourself a favor, all this is in warband plus more for about the same price)- Graphics. Not a con but considering Viking conquests animations, this one is a bit outdated nowAs a side note that can be considered either a pro or con. It can be difficult to get started. If you like a small challenge, awesome because there will be a learning curve initially. Not a huge one but it's there. Expect to be taken prisoner a few times before you learn your lesson and expect to forget that lesson and do it all over again a few times lol.Mount and Blade: Warband (Mount and Blade, the better version)Mount and Blade: Viking Conquest (Latest expansion. More difficult, larger battles, more mechanics, new factions, Pagan and Christain subfaction mechanic)There are two others as well but they are not like the previous three. Fire and Sword brings you to the polish commonweath during the days of muskets. Napoleonic is a multiplayer and custom battle only expansion during the French Revolution.			"

												Mount & Blade is a very addictive game. I spent 8 hours straight playing the game, and never got my eye off the screen. However, the losses on the game is very hard to recover from. From one moment, you have a 200 man army. In a blink of an eye, you men are all gone, and you must spend another 5 or 10 hours finding more men. One time that I was playing, I lost a battle, and I could not see my character. The camera was shown onto the water. Overall, this is a very good game, with a lot of problems and glitches.			"

												I got this game in a complete back for 75% off. Even though the titles after are good, this game destroys them in one way, which makes it way better and more playable for me. This way is combat. The other games have a function where your sword moves in the direction your mouse is moving in, while this particular game basically sets your attack in the direction of the nearest enemy. Although this sounds a lot more basic, I prefer it, along with a lot of other people. The graphics are about what you'd expect from a 2008 title, especially from a game of this type. The scales of some of the fights are really quite amazing, even though sometimes if you're fighting a massive enemy army they have to send the rest in as reinforcements or something. This is because at the time of this game's release (over 8 years ago), there wasn't really good enough hardware to have LOADS of enemies on screen AND let you fight. (Some RTS games at the time had a lot of enemies, but the graphics were inferior and you couldn't actually fight since they're RTS titles lol).I recommend this game to anyone who wants to invest a lot of time into one game, but also to people who don't have loads of times, as you can save and quit the game at any time you want.

												Personally I like this better than Warband. Trying to do a directional attack in Warband is really stiff now, I'd try to do a right directional attack and for some reason it'd think I want to do a stab. This version is a lot easier to attack in, and I'd rather play this one even if it means I'm missing out on the multiplayer (nothing special really imo) and other great features of the Warband campaign. Very good game for medieval warfare, no magic, just real medieval life.			"

												This game is amazingly fun for about 50 hours, if for no other reason than it's probably the only time you'll get to kill things from horseback. The game really reaches its peak about 20/30 hours in, when your character is strong enough - and your army large enough - to take on each realm's king and his massive personal guard. The only real issue is that there's too much sandbox: your goal is to ""make a name for yourself."" Which would be fine and dandy if you were allowed to become a king and unite the country; however, you're specifically forbidden from doing this. You're told flat-out at the beginning of the game that you can't become king. Kind of obnoxious. Also, you can't kill empires, as noblemen live forever and will swarm cities until they can re-establish their clan. So one you reach that point where a normal RPG would reward you with huge tracts of land, you instead export your character and start all over again, but this time with insanely high skills that let you fight just about anything and really screw with the early-game dynamic. Almost makes up for that whole not-being-a-king thing.			"

												Mount & Blade is a surprising game, I expected a low quality medieval game with bad combat and just an all around boring few hours of gameplay, I was wrong this game was well worth the money i spent, the open world is fun and the combat is slightly button mashy but still epic in seige battlesI give this game a 8/10 for just being an all around good and fun game			"

												I have spent many hours playing this shining treasure of a game over the last 4 years or so, and it has been one of the single greatest games I have ever played. The first time I played it, I thought to myself that I would never get anywhere in this mass-scale, fast-paced simulator of medieval combat. However, I now have eliminated the entire faction of my arch-enemy, The Kingodm of Swadia, and have full control over what used to be their lands. The Swadian king and his trusted vassels now rot in my vast dungeons like the pigs they are. And any who I have failed to capture, have been murdered by my most trusted allies, the Vaegir.All in all, this is one of the best games known to mankind, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone. 8/8 It's Gr8 M8			"

												Its a great game. My PC is not a gaming PC and it could handle it just fine. i Like games like this because they're cheap, fun and you don't need a super powerful PC. I really enjoyed how you get to choose your side because in most games they just put you on whatever side they want. You also get the customisation of your army. You choose who you recruit and choose they're classes for them as they go up so you can enjoy the game better. Also some special units you can find in taverns with actual names like Jeremus, Devachi and alot more. The special units start off with they're base skills but you can change them as they level up and with these special units you can choose they're gear. I got this at the summer picnic sale for 2.79 and after me playing Mount and Blade, i may consider getting Mount and Blade: Warband.			"

												Great medieval simulator. If you enjoy this sort of games, you'll probably spend many hours playing it. It has some bugs and flaws but nevertheless it's still very immersive and engaging experience. It's so cheap (especially during sales) so it's almost like a steal ;). Try it out if hadn't already.

Well you could call it a base for mods, because thats what I see of it, but really the native game is really fun if you want to play a medieval game. Why would I call this better then Warband? Well I've never played Warband but I call this better, because it has the Star Wars Conquest mod. I suggest that mod if your a fan of Star Wars, and if you want to download your first mod. 10/10			"

												It has quite a rough unpolished feel with low tech simplistic interface but the gameplay will consume hours and hours of your time.I love how this game creates emergent non-linear stories.So goes the tale of the Bacon Hero, a clueless adventurer who on the very first day of his journey, was captured by bandits and taken to far away lands before escaping. There, he befriended a local nobleman, negotiated for peace between waring kingdoms, herded cattle, protected the honour of a noblewoman and raided the many maruaders that littered the country side. Eventually, this adventurer, from hopeless beginnings, rose to become tournament champion and Lord Vassal of a great nation. This is just the beginning however, for the road ahead will be paved with many more battles, each either bringing bountiful victories or devastating defeats.			"

												Mount & Blade. What an epic game! Yes, it's graphics are horrid, and yes, there are a few small bugs left in there, but wow, I'm currently clocked in at 63 hours, and I know that I've at least a few more days to go until I'm satisfied with this game, and even then, I'll probably make a new character just to follow another king.This game is amazing, terrific, wonderful, and much more! Combine the combat of Chivalry and the overworld trading business with the flash game ""Caravaneer"", and this is a lot better yet. After you get through the slow tutorial, it's a challenging, yet EXTREMELY rewarding climb from nothing to king, one that 63 hours in, I have yet to achieve. The feeling of training peasants to fight bandits, then watching them go at it right afterward is epic and makes you feel like you've made a significant difference to their lives. The first army you take on and defeat leaves you gasping for breath, sweat on your forhead, and prideful of your newfound superiority. Now we get to move on to the big guns: Taking fortresses and fortefied cities! And that's a LOT more fun than it sounds!There is one big problem that has to be addressed, and that is the games difficulty. I had no problem with difficulty because I had all the options set to easiest (so that I feel like a boss), but I'm on ""22% difficulty"". If you are someone who can't stand playing on Easy, then this might be a bit rough for you and your armies.I cannot reccomend this game enough, ecspecially to those who love build-your-army type games! Once you have a feel for all the weaponry (small changes make big differences), and what race of soldier can accomplish what, you can progress rather well, and this game has been nothing but fun all the way!But it! It's super cheap, buy it!			"

												Overall: so much fun! You get a great combination of action in the medieval combat, strategy in the larger scale battles, and role-playing game classics such as choosing alliances and missions, leveling up, and suiting up.With that said, the role-playing aspect couldn't be considered truly complete on its own. Your personal relationships with lords, for instance, does indeed evolve somewhat and have an impact on the options available to you, but the relationship mechanisms in place are a little shallow. This part of the game sort of comes across as a roleplaying sandbox and only a stick to dig with. Combat and looting also suffer some issues, but overall the combat system is pretty satisfying (though you'll see what I'm talking about when you're trying to pick up weapons in the tournaments). A variety of fairly viable combat styles are available to your character, though you'll usually have to adapt to the context of the battle. Speaking of the battle contexts, you're offered a number of different scenarios, from open battles on the field to raiding throne rooms to laying siege to cities or castles. You can thus get a nice taste sword and shield battle atop a wall as well hit-and-run with mounted archery in the field. These styles and contexts also flow nicely out of the nature of your army and their background, with the Khergit, Swadians, Rhodoks, Vaegirs, and Nords differing significantly in their typical strategies. For many people that enjoy these games, the tactics surrounding match ups between these factions is the heart of what makes the game unique.Anyway, overall awesome. I look forward to trying the Warband expansion where some things will be fixed and some content will be added.			"

												While the human models can stray into Uncanny Valley, the rest of the game looks rather good. The combat system is great, with momentum mattering; as an example, if you charge someone with a horse and slice them as you pass by, you'll do more damage. It also makes it feel like an accomplishment when you storm over the castle walls and claim what is rightfully yours. Diplomacy also plays a large part in the game, but you never feel forced to do one thing or another, because this game is completely sandbox. Give it a shot!			"

												PLEASE READ THIS (or scroll to the end for a VERY helpful link):I had NO IDEA there was something more addictive than Heroin.I am speechless... My whole life I have searched for a game such as this one. I recently returned to a life of intense gaming and it was easy to find. I got all of the M&B games in a package and I can't wait to try the other ones, I hear they're even MUCH better. HOW CAN IT GET BETTER THAN THIS?! I know that M&B fans will back me on this: I HAVE NEVER FELT SO MUCH PART OF A GAME BEFORE. I am speechless, this is like being in a knight's movie. This is EVERYTHING you will ever dream of when it comes to a realistic, respectful, professional and just an awesome awesome game. I know my review is not professional but I can't stay here and write this stuff while I can have another minute of M&B. SO much to do in this game. From what I understood so far, if you could do it as a knight in real life, you can do it in the game. This is the Ultimate Knight's Game! It's like a Medival Arma when it comes to the versatility of the game. Just frickin get it and you will not regret it. I made a poor merchant pay a toll to pass a road...

Battle mechanics are great, and I even don't mind lack of graphic details, or lack of interaction between player, and things like doors, and chests.

												Life is short if you're not on a horse: the game.Holy cow is this game addictive!  The very first thing I noticed was that the graphics are a bit dated; there are sprites and menus that could use some work, and some of the animations have some glitches here and there.  It just doesn't have the polish and motion capture sparkle of modern games and I thought that would translate into me hating it.  But, the actual game play is addictive and exhilerating.Start off with the fact that this game is a sandbox.  You are not the chosen one, the world does not revolve around your actions, your story is exactly what you make it and nothing more.  This means you travel where you want, do what you want and you weather the consequences.  I got the feeling that I was a very small cog in a very big machine and for once I felt like a game gave me a sense of perspective.The strategic map offers it's own set of challenges as forces of varying strength roam the world looking for fights.  You have to pick your battles, and keep your eyes open for opportunities.  Then when you get on the battlefield, it is all hard charging and bloodshed and life just being awful for footsoldiers.  Honestly, I've gotten to the point where the biggest threat to me is a cramp in my axe arm, and I feel a little bad for those poor schmucks on the other side of the map.  The action could use some tinkering, but I've been having so much fun playing it, I can't say that it is really broken.I bought this game on sale and got my money's worth.  It's worth more than that.  I've had a lot of fun!			"

												Have I not yet written a review on this? That is because every time I go into steam I thought of nothing else but playing this game. Hole- ee - sheeat. This game...is...ridiculously AMAZING!! This is a mideval combat simulator sandbox real-time-strategy-esque rpg adventure. Why is it not famous? Because its made by indie devs (very successful ones at that) This comes with the advantage of having extremely down to earth devs, who have made this game as gamers. Have you ever wanted to live in mideval times? Here ya go. There are 5 kingdoms, each who contest for ultimate domination. Neither can maintain peace or decide on total war. There are kingdoms, such as the Nords, based on the Vikings....or the Kerghit Khans, based on Genghis Khan or Attila the Hun...or Vaegers, based on Russians. Many more. It's one helluvan amazing game, as you create a character (totally awesome character creater, and can edit at any time), and are thrown in the middle of it all. (More in Comments)			"

You go from city to city, gathering troops and fighting intense battles. It has tight combat, money is harder to obtain, providing a challenge, and its so open ended.

												Start off as a no-name, medieval warrior and, through determination and valor, make yourself into a powerful noble.  It may be basic in its execution of certain role-playing elements, but the level of freedom that Mount and Blade allows is exceptional.  Besides the raiding,  questing, and politicking you can do, you even get to simultaneously command and participate in battles.  There's nothing quite like ordering your infantry to engage an enemy force while you lead a cavalry charge against their flank, or gathering your warriors to your side to rush forth from a siege tower to assault your enemy's ramparts.If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a feudal lord, this is your game.

While not the most visually striking game, or the most open ended RPG game in a somewhat fantasy setting, it  will eat up a lot of your time before you know it.

												If ever you wanted a medieval feudal lord version of Sid Meier's Pirates! look no further than Mount & Blade. The world changes around you whether you like it or not, but your actions, such as seiging a castle affect the world in turn. Add a decent battle system that provides numerous ways to fight your battles, and you have perhaps the best medieval action/simulation/strategy/RPG there is.			"

												My favorite of all of the Mount & Blade series. The unit grouping in this version is quite unique compared to the other games in this series. Many modules for this version and many of them are far better than any on the other Mount & Blade games. Highly recommended to you guys and your friends.			"

												A good game for those who enjoy tactical sandboxes, the game starts slow but soon unfolds into a an epic tale of slaughter and mayhem or perhaps justice and order (pfft seriously ? everyone knows nobodys gonna play this for that)the game changes based on your decisions and you have a huge amount of freedom to affect your world.The only problems tend to occur with the combat mechanics which have a tendency to bug out and not deal damage when  a solid hit is made or for a block to not be noted. But this is nothing worse than the popular IOS app Injustice and it definitel doesnt break the game.PS- yes the game is old but perhaps there are mods around that can be used to increase texture and visual quality, who knows.overall id give this a 7/10			"

												Best combat on horse or foot that I've played so far. Realistic combat mechanics, both on foot and mounted; the game's strong point is a simulation of combat on horseback.Visually impressive even though this game is already a few years old. The environment rendering like the dynamic lighting of day and night cycles and occasional weather effects like fog or rain are convincing. Graphic details are very much customizable.Game is very flexible and non-linear; you are free to do as you please; stay neutral or pick sides, hunt bandits or do quests, in any order and at your own pace. Issue tactical commands during 1st person battle or strategic commands on the world map. Strategic commands are only available after joining a faction and after being elected as the marshal.Use your marshal appointment to mobilize a huge battalion and engage on a war path OR NOT. NPC AI in battle and pathfinding is adequate. If the lords are not mobilized, they will most likely patrol or do their own thing; they may also occasionally attempt to besige a castle but they will not coordinate with other lords unless you're not the marshal but just one of the house lords, in which case, another marshall will coordinate the army. So if you don't want the game to end so soon, don't coordinate a castle siege.Though character class is non-existent, role-playing elements are quite extensive. Distribute attributes & skill points to your preferred style of play. Weapon proficiency increases through usage. Neither magic nor alchemy is needed here; the setting of this game is medieval fiction rather than mythological fantasy but it has enough interesting elements, depth of gameplay & replayability to draw you back and try something new.Ahh, before I end this lengthy justification of a recommendation, I do have a few gripes about M&B, albeit minor ones. One is that morale of the party gradually goes down over time; the bigger the party the faster it declines and morale only gets a major boost after a major battle is won, this makes it virtually imperative to look for trouble to keep the troops happy even though they are always paid on time and adequately supplied with a variety of food types. If the troops do not get their fix of adrenaline they may eventually desert your party. Luckily bandits roam about all the time, you just have to be fast enough to nail them. As you might have guessed by now, the other thing is that troop maintenance is high, so you got to constantly fight in tournaments, look for quests, sell loot, sell prisoners to the slave market, or collect taxes but by far the most lucrative way of earning money is placing bets in the tournaments, looting enemy villages or extorting from enemy caravans. No rest for the weary.Despite its aggravating tendencies, this game does integrates aspects of role-play, strategy, action and simulation equally well in a neat polished package and this kind of inclusive gameplay I have not seen nor played before, hence my recommendation.

												It doesn't get much sandboxier than this. Mount & Blade puts you in the role of an adventurer in a land torn apart by wars, both civil and regular. Build your band of mercenaries, perform errands for kings, train the villagers to defend themselves, and shoot your bow from horseback (good luck with that last one).Mount & Blade is like Elder Scrolls on crack. Much less structured storyline, much bigger sandbox. This is what I imagine a Game of Thrones game would be like.The political systems are really cool, but combat has a pretty steep learning curve. Play the tutorial, then play through the training missions in-game. And srsly, if you can shoot a bow from horseback with any accuracy, my hat's off to ya. I think it might actually be easier in real life. Never ridden a horse, but I've shot a bow, and that's a lot harder in this game than it is in my backyard.Sword and board is a lot like Oblivion or Skyrim, but more... I dunno. Just better. You have finer control.A-. This is one of those games that I keep meaning to go back to, but then realize that I'd have to start all over from scratch because I don't remember how to play.			"

												This Medievil sandbox game is fun, enjoying and relaxing to play. The comabt is simplistic but also fun. The choices in this game are many from making your own empire to helping an already existing faction take over or just hop around each faction being a mercenary. The gameplay is easy to understand and fun and the added need of strategy in some battles makes the game that much more fun. However, the graphics as well as customization are to be desired as character customization is quite rough and very few options exists for facial hair, hair color, hair styles, and overall facial features. The graphics are there but look rough and edgy making the game hard to really appreciate it's true beauty. This game also boast an impressive skill set allowing for you to spec into many different weapons as well as skills and attributes. This game gets an overall of 8/10 with the graphics and customization spoiling it's potential.			"

												Here's the deal with Mount & Blade. When it was released it was epic. Seriously one of the best RPGs you could find. Simple enough to grasp the concepts quickly and yet with enough depth to surprise you after even 30 hours played. Everyon who played it, loved it. Then Taleworld released M&B Warband. And everyone felt a little cheated. Reason being it revealed that the original M&B was essentially a Beta. Warband had all the little things that M&B was missing. Starting your own nation, getting married for political purposes, even a health meter for your horse.Then came Fire and Sword. Bleh.Warband is the game I would recomend, especially if your going un-modded or just small mods.  But my real recomendation is that you buy M&B and then get the LOTR mod overhaul. This is the best mod ever. Complete Lord of The Rings overhaul. the guys who made this spent 4 years on it. Incredible. Well worth the $10 bucks you'd spend on this game.			"

												great game , once you start playing time seems too fly. the player can can jump into a world split into to diffrent factions at war with each other for controll of the land. Also for each faction there is another claimant for the throne who players can help reclaim their faction and cause a civil war. The player can also recruit people into his own party and become a rebel who roams the land taking over castles and looting villages but then in time all the factions declare war on you and seek to take your lands for themselves. highly recommended.

This stoked my interests.  I went to this games review page and found the same sort of thing being said about it.  I like to try the first game of a series before i try any of the newer one's.  I figure the only reason there is a second or thrid game in a series is because the first one rocked.  Plus its usally a cheaper way to get a taste of what a game series is all about.The game is fantastic and i also cant believe i didnt know of this game until now.  If i ever finish this one ill most certainly be trying the rest of the series.  Maybe not the newest one with guns, i can get that in 100 different flavors already.			"

												I suggest if you are going to buy a mount and blade game buy mount and blade warband or wait for bannerlord because mount and blade warband is much more fleshed out with better game concepts.			"

												This game is great! And was totally worth the price. Starting with the negatives, after a while it does become a little repetative but with a few fun mods including StarWars conquest and so on, it can become like another experience again. My favorite points include:-Great combat mechancis -A decent AI-Nice choice of weapons and armour-Good mapOverall I'm really enjoying the game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good strategy/combat/medieval game.

												Great gameplay, you really have to think about who you verse, what you do and who you are friends with. A deep combat system for a game of its day. If you don't like playing as a thief, make a new character and become a lord. Explore the different combinations you can use and see what playstyle suits you. A variety of weapons, from bows and crossbows to heavy greatswords.

You can help any nation any town out, take them over, own slaves to do your bidding or turn them into your workers or men at arms to fight along side you. The things that take place in this game and all the stuff you can do is redonkulouse. One of my favorite sims of all time, you need to get this so you can understand what I mean.

												Fire and Sword + Warband is better then this version since this was the original, but I still recommend it. It's SUPER immersive if you can look past the old character graphics.Pros:- Immersive- Beautiful Enviroment graphics for it's age- Mounted Combat- Challenging and strategic battles and missions- Literally can choose whatever you want to beCons:- Not so appealing Character Graphics- No voice acting, it's old so it's expected, just be prepared to read a lot.- Many options to start out but very offer the advantage you need to get ahead- Late game Bandits a bit too OP, always had issues with them and it would take almost an hour to get my huge army back.- Archery feels too difficult, a problem that seems to exist throughout most of the series.It takes several gameplays and a good first blind run to really understand what to do, but when you figure it out it's quite fun and you can get pretty far. A lot of strategy is requires especially in later parts of the game. Choose your nation, abandon your nation. Be a bandit, be a merchant, be a warlord. Be whoever you want to bloody be! Give this a shot if you don't think you can afford the other games I recommended above. If all else fails, wait til the sales come, it's so worth it.			"

												has a lot of issues not least of which is lack of proper mod support and proper mod tools... so currently modding is very limited and you can only have one 'game' mod running at a given time, with a very good chance of crashing.cannot run more than one mod at a time for the main game/storyline.* clarification on 'game mod:- a addon game mode playable by itself using the game as a engine over the 'native' default game from the launcher.the game has quite a few bugs/glitches/issues, fortunetly most of them are not game breaking and minor... most of the issues are with horse riding as compared to RL.the bugs and glitches can be overlooked for the most part, occasionally the game can crash because of running mods to main game 'native'.however the gameplay is unique and the game is worth getting for 10 bucks or if you catch a sale price.for the most part it runs better than triple A released games (more stable than FO3/FNV/TES games).

												At first glance, M&B seems like another bland Medieval Combat game. It was designed by a Turkish Couple and, let's be honest, isn't the prettiest game in this generation. As the age old mantra ""Never Judge a Book By It's Cover"" states, however, Mount and Blade is much more than meets the eye. The game is a full simulation of a land dominated by several kingdoms, each one vyying for domination. In the center of the chaos is you; a lone sellsword whose only advantage is indomitable will and a (possible) noble background. The game allows you to do whatever you please; swear fealty to a king, ascend the ladder of nobility through marriage and political gaming, raise an army and siege castles and strongholds, compete in tournaments for honor and cash, or just spend your days ambushing caravans and living off of the spoils. There's no wrong way to play the game and no matter what method you choose, you'll have fun. The game also boasts a fantastic combat system and several mods. Get it.			"

And the fact that I had to learn literally everthing in this game by myself, (besides melee fighting) also made me a little frusrated. But as I played it more and more, I realized I was enjoying it, fighting battles that I won and lost, losing men I had in my army, taking prisoners of war and being chased by thier friends. I enjoyed every second of it. However I think you would be better off getting Mount and Blade warband due to the fact that this version does not have multiplayer.			"

												Normally I'd say just get Mount and Blade: Warband and skip this one, but the original is still pretty awesome. If you can get this with a bundle deal for cheap then I'd recommend still getting it because people have made some interesting mods for this one (such as the Star Wars mod) that don't exist for Warband. Otherwise this one doesn't have any real advantage over Warband; the latter is just a more modern version of the original with more features and detail.			"

												Mount & Blade is a fantastic action-strategy-RPG with the best horseback-based fighting engine I have ever experienced.  Battles can grow very large with 32+ infantry and horse based units racing around in a chaotic bloody mess... with you experiencing the action from an ""over the shoulder"" perspective.  Strategy elements are managed via a large regional map from which you move your army from place to place accepting quests or following your own agenda.  ""Heroes"" in you army can be levelled up, like you, and you can purchase new gear or just use the loot from your kills.  Some will think the grafx are a bit primitive, but honestly you will not notice after landing a few headshots galloping across the field.  Also the game does not lead you down any particular path... you will need to explore a bit and just try things.  Eventually you won't be able to stop playing.  The best indie-game ever.			"

Perhaps this recommendation tells you more about me, the author, than about the game? Maybe so. Maybe it tells you that I haven't the slightest shred of what one might call a life.

												I really love mount and blade but I hate that the other factions have lords to control their castle's but when you takeover a castle without joining a faction you can't have a lord and it really sucks. I love the game but I also wish that they made a option to play like a star wars mode or a lord of the rings mode where if you pick the star wars mode it was just like star wars conquest. So i'm just saying i love the game but there are thimgs that need to be added befrore i love love love love love this game so if you will please do this that would be great.

												So you are some random person with a warband. Sometimes you start with a horse sometimes you don't. You go around gathering a large number of idjiots to fight for you and realize in combat they have no idea what they are doing. You are promptly captured. So you escape. Form another band and attack again. Your men the idiots that they are run around till their spread out and get slaughtered. You are promptly captured again. Then you form a massive army for revenge and promptly run out of food and they desert you. Hey its sid meiers pirates but your running around with a buncha morons who promptly die on first contact with the enemy.			"

												Picked up this game this past weekend when there was a sale going on, and decided to write a review. Overall this game has potential, but the graphics could do with some upgrades, especially the open range where your just traveling the land. Of the two towns i explored slightly the detail is good, and it really gives a good feel for the mideval period. However, the game crashed on me and i was not happy with that, even though any game will have its bugs. Rating: 7/10Needs some graphical upgrades, dialogue upgrades, and some detail upgrades.			"

												Everything starts somewhere, right? And with Mount & Blade TaleWorlds truly took a giant leap into the gaming world.Mount & Blade is a excellent Open World Strategy RPG. Why the strange genre? Well, simply put I find it really hard to put it under just one label. It's open world in the way that you can travel anywhere whenever you want. It's a strategy game because you need to utilize your smarts and plan your army according to what enemy you face. Yet it's an RPG because of the levelling system and the different skills and specializations.But to be honest this game is not worth it. If there is anything we should all know by now it is that Mount & Blade: Warband (A sequel of sorts) is exactly like it's predecessor except 100% better. So the reason I do not recommend this game is because I would strongly urge you to buy Warband instead for all the added features and because the map was greatly improved. So don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful game but the sequel does everything this game can do but a hundred times better.			"

												As much as I enjoy this game, I've run into problems where it freezes and crashes after around 35 days of in-game time, regardless, I've created three dynasties to suffer this fate:Rockington:  Normal character, jumped in, did my thing, got a decent army and was feared by bandits. Good trader, horse rider, did bow and also sword.Omar Yathrib:  Trying-too-hard-to-be-serious character, tried to amass a large army, constantly lost them to ungodly-sized groups of mountain bandits which are everywhere. Tyrone of Watermelonia:  Not-at-all-serious character. Pillaging warlord. Destroyed villages, amassed armies, murdered the innocent. Used an axe, spear and sword. It's such a fun game because there's so much you can do. This one is much more realistic compared to other medieval games, but I still highly recommend you get Warband. I made the mistake of getting this instead and look where it got me.It's a fun game, but you get the same game, plus a truly epic multiplayer, with M&B:  Warband.			"

												Pretty much a sandbox RPG, which is not really as great as it sounds.  The quests are completely dull and the entire story amounts to some exposition and the odd feature that your enemies prefer to capture you and take your stuff rather than simply kill you so that you won't take revenge in the future.It's a good experiment in seeing how many fiefs or territory you can acquire, or whether you can outfit your guy in the most expensive armor before he bites the poverty bullet or you get too bored with it.I played with this game for many hours, which is to say, i experimented with it.  The combat is a mildly interesting wargame about conserving troop morale with the power of food, blocking and annoyingly aim-centric swinging that avoids combos and feels more like D&D due to how much easier it is to miss the opponent instead of actually hit them or get blocked by them (except when you're on foot), making sure you have enough horses and the right weather and time of day to optimize your travel speed across the map graphic, verbally telling off your follower NPCs for arguing with each other, and a bunch of other stuff that is really only interesting in concept rather than presentation or follow through.The only real merit, is of course, mounted combat against forces on foot, cheesey castle sieges that aren't worth much after the first few (or 10 or so, if you're me), and the concept of the game itself.FINAL SCORE: 55.

												This game is a meme in itself. It's basically an excel sheet with PS1 graphics for artificial medieval riding and fighting gameplay. It takes about 4 hours to set everything up and get started with playing the game. I can only see that someone could enjoy this if he has way too much time at his hands.			"

												I'm not recommending this game not because it isn't a good game, but for another reason.It's a more realistic take on Skyrim. It's a game set in the time of knights, kings and queens. However there is no magic, no dragons, no fantasy elements. It's you, and whatever you decide your goal to be as there's no real way to win. Do you want to become a famous mercenary, or gladiator, do you want to command an army, or be a trader?It's a really unique and well done game, however I will not recommend it because the follow up game, Mount and Blade Warband, is the same as this game, however has many more added features.

												Its strengths are that you can really customise your playstlye and weapon loadouts to your liking.    It allows for you to recruit as you like.    The character also has a very indepth skill system.    There is a SDK available that alows for custom modules to be made for your liking.   Its weakness are the wide spread glithing ranging from invisible walls, horses not being able to move foreward, and weapons not registering.   These glithes are very common, and almost make ranged weapons not worth bothering with,   I also wish I could choose my own custom faction and culture and lords so I can more easily own calaridia.   The quests are very repetitive, and move you in the direction of joining the factions too much.   The weapon balence for ranged weapons are broken in the way that the  ranged weapons are the most glitched aspect of the game, and need more ammunition to be worthwhile later in the game where the bigger battles take place.   The sige gameplay is very slow paced and needs at least 2 breaching points per fortification to be of a respectible pace.Overall, you should just get warband, because warband fixed some problems, and has a new faction, more mods, and some multiplayer capabilities.

What started as a medieval combat simulator with a two person family dev team has been expanding quite well over the years with sequels, instead of updatesYou should just go play Warband, though. It's basically a much improved version of this, as opposed to an entirely new sequel.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												This game has blocky unfinished looking graphics. The world map is barely better than old school Final Fantasy Games. The game only allows 150 characters on screen at any time. The average army is much larger by the end of the game. That means that you have to fight as a woundable character that has to lead an army that comes on screen in waves. Every battle looks the same. The castle sieges involve one or two ladders and no seige equipment. The various factions are designed off real world empires and all the weapons are High Middle Ages Chivalric equipment. Some Stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ got all butthurt so I am making sure I explain why this title is past its life. This game was a good start, but the developers get better each game. Mount & Blade Bannerlord is out this year... although they seem to be getting the hots for the weapon and army look of the late Dark Ages and that ♥♥♥♥ is getting annoying. Your call. Like any title with Mods available, you can make the game better, but you would be better off buying newer versions if you have a computerr built post 2010.			"

												I think Mount & Blade is easily one of the most overlooked games of the last decade. Warband is currently the best option, but the original is still a great game. If you've yet to check it out, I recommend getting Warband. If you're willing to wait, though, Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord should be coming out soon-ish.			"

												This is where it all started, the amazing Mount & Blade franchise. Mount and Blade is a great game, although very barebones. It is very sloppy and amateurish, Warband improves on this game in every way. (refer to my Warband review for my feeling on this franchise and Warband in general) Don't get this game unless you need a new Mount & Blade fix waiting for Bannerlord. Still a very good game.			"

												Mount & Blade is a really special game! The battles are unique in both commands to your troops, and number of troops! In M&B you can choose your own path, you can choose your faction (kingdom) or if you want to stay independent! when you get tired of the original game, you can download mods, for example; star wars conquest, and a Lord of the Rings mod! this is a great game!

												If you want just one game from the bundle, go for Warband instead, as that's an improved version of this one. BUT!!! The original still holds very well on its own!If you did get the collection, by all means start with this one, for an ""extended tutorial"" before Warband if for nothing else, so you can make mistakes to avoid them later. And to have a fresh more appreciating go at the successor instead of a replay of same game. Some nice mods work for original only, too. You're dropped in an open ended medieval world, there is no story really (mods may help with that), you need to figure out yourself what it is you want to achieve.Do tasks for peasants or lords, or pillage villages and besiege castles. Fight bandits or raid caravans, or travel and trade yourself. Serve a king, care for your fiefdom, or relieve incumbent from throne duty by supporting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Win tournaments, win wars. Get rich and famous. Pimp up your ride and get that lordly armor. And level up, honing skills!			"

												Truely a unique experience in terms of strategy and RPG games.  Not only can you manage your troops in an enviornment with multiple RPG elements, you also get to lead them into battles and fight the battles! With armies, possibly going into the thousands.  It is interesting to in a way most strategy and RPG games don't dive into and quite addicting.  I recommend this to anyone that wouldn't mind leading an army into battle from the front lines, not from the commander's seat.			"

												Hilariously difficult to start up and learn.

Hey, why does he get clothes?""""I cannot hit a dummy on a horse for the life of me.""""How the hell... why..."" *sigh*(Creating a character) ""This is some deep background, I must be applying for Top Secret clearance later at the castle.""(Starting the game) ""Um... so... I'm just in the middle of a field somewhere... I assume I frolicked and pranced all the way here from the coast and then suddenly realized I had no idea where I was going. I mean, I still have no idea where I'm going of course.""""Yep. Single room with wooden tables, guard, guard, but no lord. This is the crappiest Castle I've ever seen.""""How do I get out of here? Seriously, I'm at the gate, but there's no option to actually leave.""""Where the f*** is Ab-... Amb-... wherever the bandits supposedly are.""""Hm. I'm not sure how this is going to work... I'm supposed to train the peasants to fight bandits, but a different set of bandits altogether just attacked the village and... yeah: 'Bandits are looting the village.' And the only option I have is 'Leave'...""So if you're recording a fun ""I tried to play this game"" YouTube video, it should be awesome.(Mount and Blade: Warband does a better job at this part of the game.

												this is a game where you grow to your apex then you get the crap kicked out of you. starting out of just you, you grow to a band of 150 soldiers. as you travel do quests and fight in battle, your Rep increases. when i gets high enough you may join a faction, when you join, you get a village and later as you fight you will get a small fort, and if you get lucky a castle. but to warn you, the more castles you get the harder it is to defend them, seeing that when factions go to war they will have 8 other generals with the king with each having about 100 men each, you have to pay your men so the more men you have and better skilled they are, the more expensive it is, so battles and selling equipment and goods is how you survive, also food is important, In short if you want the most realistic Medevil Feudal game, this is the game for you.

I know that the graphics might look janky, the animations don't really look phenomenal, there is no voice acting and the mission variety is not huge, but this game really hooks you. The combat system itself is hard to master, but once you do, it's ridiculously satisfying. Believe me when I tell you that there is no better feeling than riding your horse full speed and connecting perfectly against your enemy with a huge two-handed axe. The only thing I've got to say is that if you have a at least halfway decent computer, buy Warband instead, because it's basically the same game, only with much better graphics and more variety in the missions.

												The old school overhead-view world map harkens back to RPG classics but each battle launches the player into a twitchy first person deathmatch.  Here Mount & Blade's beauty lies in it's simplicity.  Let your NPC allies draw fire while you stab, slash and bludgeon your way through the enemy ranks one left-click at a time.  Aim with your cursor and time every block and right-clicked parry or bait a big swing out of an enemy with a well-timed sidestep or circle-strafe; you're in complete control.  While settings do allow the user to enable auto-directional blocking and tone down damage levels to make combat more forgiving, the real joy comes out when you crank up the difficulty.  One misstep, a slight hesitation in bringing up your shield, a misjudged attack or an errant arrow could mean the difference between victory and defeat.  THIS is how first person melee combat should play.			"

It's not a huge world but you can go basically everywhere. The point of the game is to do whatever you want. You create your character and then, poof, you're set free to do whatever. You can choose a faction to be a part of and gradually work your way to the top. You can go free lance and kill everybody. It's an interesting concept but it left a little to be desired.			"

												This game is both an rpg, third person fighting game, and strategy game, with the option for some town management too. I would liken it to a Game of Thrones in the sense that it has many factions that interact with each other in the game world and it's very political, however as the player you can align with any of them or just strike off on your own. It's set in a hard medieval world, with no magic or fantasy elements though that isn't a downside whatsoever. In this game you will forge your own path in a war torn land amidst clashing kingdoms, choose to be a lord, a bandit, a trader, a Robin-Hood like vigilante, or anything in between.

The downsides are outdated graphics, repetitive action and music, and not much variety in gameplay. It is also the slowest moving game ever.

The party mechanics are well thought out, and the towns offer just enough to do to keep you looking for more. I was wholly impressed at how well the narrative scaled to what you were doing in the world, and how it did it all with no linear story elements. Bravo!  (Most of my playtime is off Steam, so I am thuroughly familiar with product)			"

												If you already have warband, I still think this game is worth buying. With mods like Star Wars conquest and The Last Days (of the third age) being some of the best mods for it, even though there's still things like them for warband.All in all, you should get this game if your just starting out in the Mount and Blade series or you want to see where it all started.

												Get it, play it, love it. Starting with a Mount and a Blade... welcome to your Medieval sandbox. Become a bandit robbing caravans or climb the social ranks and be known as a graceful lord or lady... It's all there. Fighting from horseback with a lance and on foot with a nice big sword in a rather realistic way of swinging and blocking is what got me into this game; I spent 65 hours allone in this basic version... until I got my hands on the follower...

												This is also a good game (see my review for Mount and Blade: Warband). This is $5 cheaper, but it has just as much content. If you are interested, and can only buy one of them, buy Warband. So many more mods, better graphics and gameplay, almost everything is improved. Also, you got bad-♥♥♥ DLC.			"

												I spent almost a hundred hours playing just a single mod and almost more playing the original game the gameplay is fun and innovative you actually feel your power growing as your army gets larger and larger and you ean more and more land and you can go at factions however you want will you join one side of the war or will you start your own faction and become the overlord of the world, rig leaderships and make sure your man becomes the leader. Even if you hate medieval bow and sword games no problems there are some excellant mods that bring in muskets and pistols and even a mod that brings in the universe of star wars with blasters and lightsabers included. One of the game's few downfalls is in the graphics they are quite dated and could be touched up with a better engine however the game itself is amazing and the amount of modding that goes into the game turns it into an amazingly different game.

												Mount & Blade is a bit more like the newer Elder Scrolls games in that, despite the fact that it has all the skills and stats that we come to expect from an RPG, all of the combat is real-time and the player is in control of the action.  As a result, combat feels a lot more fluid and less clunky then menu-based combat, and it feels like more varied experience as a result.  But to drone on about combat for too long would seem unfair, as that is only one small part of M&B's design.  The amount of variaty and choice the game presents you with is impressive.  It gives you this choice not through the means of dialoge options, (which are a part of the game, but are not a big feature) but by presenting you with varied ways of playing.  When a game can be just as fun playing as a merchant with a high trade skill instead of playing as a lord commanding warrior bands, you have done somthing very, very right.  Villiages provide more mild quests for farmers and traders, while kings and cities can offer up challenging and exciting quests for those looking for adventure.  The quests themselves, however, are generally pretty bland.  Most of them are randomly generated fetch/kill/deliver tasks.  I can't count on both hands how many times I ended up delivering a message or collecting taxes.  I would have liked for a few more scenarios for these quests, and perhaps even some non-random quests initiated by certain in-game events.  The presentation is somewhere in the middle of the scale.  While enviornments can be very impressive, characters are *just* realsitic enough to make thier creepy, empty-faced stares downright unsettling.  While I understand how out of place it would have felt, I would have perfered slightly more caricatured character models to keep them out of the uncanny valley.  Music, on the other hand, feels just right, and fits the fantasy world like a glove, even if it is mostly ambient.  But overall the asthetics make for a very nice fantasy atmosphere.       Mount and Blade is a game that is hard to get into at first due to a steep learning curve and lack of any good tutorials.  But once you finnaly get through the initial phase of confusion, you will find a true gem of a game underneath.			"

												After living the life of a merchant, I woke up one day and decided to be a full on vigilante. Luckily I was pretty charismatic and plenty of Khagit Horseman were down to follow me in to battle. After a few skirmishes with bandits, I was asked to collect taxes for a Lord whom I wanted favor with - So I taxed the hell out of his city and ran off with the cash. With that money I used my Merchant skills to ♥♥♥♥, pillage and plunder little towns and then sell the illl gotten wares back to the province capitals for a small fortune.My armys upkeep was about $700 weekly by day 15 and I was still handing out raises like a boss. Then it hit... War. I joined with a larger multi-lord army and conquered castle after castle until... Bam. Our meager 700 man fighting force was destroyed by the Nordic armies, numbering just over 800 men.... Everyone faught valiantly but it wasnt enough...  I was captured and held prisoner for days before escaping. Now, with my hidden stash of coins I head back to my home country to raise more armies of steppe horseman... I seek revenge,--> weak graphics but a fun fricking game. 10/10 - im addicted.			"

Its fun playing and then having your fortunes suddenly reversed. I was playing with an army of 150 and then all the armies from a single kindom surrounded my city. It was a bitter fight between me and my 200 strong garrison on one side an 1250...needless to say I lost and they destroyed my lands. I allied with their enemy and set about exterminating them from the map in revenge. So much fun.			"

												BOOM! Headshot!Pros: army management, resource management, negotiation skills, swords and no magicsCons: you can't just conquer things on your own to be an invader king man on your ownPro Tip: Pick a fast-ish, burly horse, and equip a pole-axe. When combat starts, charge right at your opponents without touching the M1 button at all, and guide your pole-axe so that it clips enemies in the head. Congrats, you win all the wars because you do 6000% damage to everything with this tactic!B-I should really get Warband someday			"

												There's nothing better than a good old shanking simulator! And Mount and Blade is just that! Mixed with RPG and FPS mechanics, mount and blade can render giant battlefields filled with hundreds of units no problem! Even on lower end systems it can handle it's own unit count extremely well. The textures are a bit dated, and the animations are slightly rigid, but that doesn't matter much when you've just defended your castle against the odds.

												Sometimes good aspects of a game set such an high standard of game fun that it can not be brought down by any negative aspects. ""Mount and blade"" is such a game in my opinion. So I wanted to evaluate X reasons ""mound and blade"" is a good and fun game in spite of many downsides. And I came up with 5 reasons which are as follows.But firstly lets quickly sum up the downsides of the game which are as follows: very low variety in different quests, no over the top skill tree or leveling system, bad (too much texture based) graphics, lifeless surroundings, shallow economy, no in-story character development.-The fact that there is no story at all benefits the game in a great deal and makes mount and blade an unique project. As the game gives the player total freedom. Or put in other words this freedom gives the player endless possibilities, endless time to achieve your personal goals ore level your character and troops into the wanted team, endless opportunities, endless ways of doing the same thing.-Huge vacuum for players own imagination gives the player the opportunity to create his own story. Because as the player plays the game presented in its rather dull graphic and with no quest- or story-forced job to do the players mind wanders of and creates its own things to do, its own goals to achieve, its own realm, its own disputes between companions, kings, marshals, soldiers, its own wars, its own loves and friendships and therefore it creates the perfect game for each individual player.-The battle and combat system is like tailor made for the game as it hast the right demand of needed skill but is not as of-putting to newcomers as many other games.-The huge amount of mods created by a very active community helps the game allot because with the scenario change created by new mods the passion for the game is inflamed again.-Connected with the total freedom and the great variety of mods the replayeable factor of the game is (nearly to) high.http://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/2017/04/5-reasons-mount-and-blade-is-good-and.html "

												I should'nt be enjoying this game as much as I do, it's still early days learning now to play but after the training guides I was set up with enough knowledge to start feeling my way round the game. My loves: I'm just playing on a standard Notepad laptop, no bells or whisles for this PC and the low res/graphics dont bother me. It's like I've started to enjoy the ""old shool"" in it's simplicity. My hate: The more you learn about the game, the more it's boundries become clear and I feel like the character leveling inhibits your game progress and expantion.I am enjoying the exporing and story line. The action is fun and regular, I like how if you are quick enough you can avoid a potential loss to and much larger force. If you lose a battle there is consiquences BUT you can dust yourself off and rebuild easily. My tip: Make sure you are always light and fast, speed is the key. Being heavy will slow you down and reduce your options, stay mobile			"

												Be sure you buy Mount and Blade:Warband if you want to try this. Medieval Combat has never been done better. You can fight on horseback, which no other game has ever done well. Also  raise and train armies, fight for kingdoms of your choice, take over kingdoms. While the overland map does look like a strategy game, all combat is done as a 3rd person action game. It also features an easy controls to give basic commands to your troops.This games is completly sandbox.

												Mount & Blade is honestly one of my favourite RPG's. It seems complex at first, but once you're into it, there's no getting out. It's like a black hole of awesome. I highly reccomend giving it a try, but if you aren't already buying it, here are some reasons why you should!                PROS!Actually challenging enemiesGreat combat, very smoothGood StoryFun Gameplay, keeps you entertained                CONS!Rough graphics, but im not one for looksSome repetitive sequences, but not manyHope you enjoyed this little review, and i hope it compelled you to buy this epic game!

												Mount and Blade this was a game that took the gaming community by surprise, this game grabbed a huge following for it was the RPG game that changed the playing field. Instead of ground soldiers running errands or mega doom cleric/wanderer. U were the man with no past and no strings free to do as he please, join a kingdom, fight for a king, overthrow another king, unite the lands, marraud the lands as an embasy of extreme might that owned the landscape and its plunder. M&B was special becuase it offered alot more to the battle and politics of medievil RPG. u could take a castle by braking down the doors and taking it over. U could raise a great economy in your kingdom and dwarf the armies of the other nations by yourself, or u could do what most people did, Become the small Overwelming powerhouse party of merily men that u could muster. Fun game, Awesome battles!			"

And yet it remains SO MUCH FUN even years later.You can make your own hero - male OR female. You choose your starting stats. You can become a slaver, a trader, a warrior, a ruler, a sapper, or a thief. This game was a sandbox before sandbox was a common term. Mount and Blade is a good game and you should play it.			"

												This is by far the best game I have played in my life. It (and the Prophesy of Pendor mod) took a very large chunk of my life from me and I enjoyed every moment of it. Do not see the number of hours on Steam - I played it without Steam for years (I didn't get an account till 3 years back). This game and it's community introduced me to the whole world of mods and other user generated content. I didn't know of the existence of such things till then. It was changing point in my life - hobbies and even helped change my work ethics for the better - why couldn't do better at my work when people put so much care and effort into a game mod/hobby? Do anything and everything - whether good or bad properly is what I learnt and it's helping me till now.So I will give this game my most positive rating! If I can I would give it ""Infinite"" thumbs up but sadly there is no option for it. Buy this game and you will not regret it but be prepared to lose hours and hours of your life.P.S: Couching is still the best :) Killed off who knows how many millions of Nord solo with it :)			"

The downsides are outdated graphics, repetitive action and music, and not much variety in gameplay. It is also the slowest moving game ever. It takes huge amounts of gametime to build any structures, or to even become big enough in game to compete with the AI factions. I'd say wait for a steam sale, but give it a good look.			"

												So an indie programming team decided to make a game in a low-fantasy universe that featured mounted combat... and wow, did they succeed! The game not only implements an open sandbox universe, but has an amazing random engounter generator! The party mechanics are well thought out, and the towns offer just enough to do to keep you looking for more. I was wholly impressed at how well the narrative scaled to what you were doing in the world, and how it did it all with no linear story elements. Bravo!

												It doesn't get old quickly, but it does get old at some point, but still the level of tactics needed to survive a battle just on normal difficulty is enough to bring you back, this is the best game to get for everything tactics wise. That and the mods. Just get it, or better yet, get Warband. The mods re-create the game. In ways even better than the original. Especially the LOTR mod, and the 1888 Western mod. All free, all great.			"

												Mount & Blade has brought something new to the market. The medieval rpg that's now also online, thanks to M&B Warband makes immersion easy as there are many addicting qualities in the game. The story isn't half bad either, when I played it the first times, I felt like it lacked in storytelling, but I believe that it's taken into consideration by Taleworlds and revised.All in all, it's a good game. If you like games like Oblivion, not for the graphics, but the feel, I would recommend getting this game and supporting the indie developers.			"

												A lot of people here are saying that Warband was an improvement in every regard, but I disagree. There are a couple of things that the original Mount & Blade did better.- More complex level design allows for more tactical combat, with the exception of the plethora of invisible walls within these levels, specifically at castles. If I'm going too close to a ledge, I'd prefer to fall off and learn the hard way, rather than being blocked from falling at all.- A condensed map makes campaigns move much quicker, and reduces a lot of the tedious running around, not to mention the fact that I can get to situations before they finish. Nothing quite angers me in Warband such as getting a notification for an event happening on the other side of the map, only to get there and find out I just missed it.That being said, there are a few issues which I've noticed here that have been fixed in its sequel.- The journal does not keep a record of everything that Warband does.- Combat occasionally feels sloppy. Unresponsive controls and weird hit detection can make some fights, particularly melee, take too long.- Getting in and out of a merc contract or vassalage without ruining one's reputation (with both leaders and opposing factions) is extremely difficult.Of course, Warband ironed out these problems and added some graphical upgrades, a bigger map, and another faction. It improved on the original in almost every way, but I found it worth a few hours of my time to explore this game's superior castles, towns, and villages, at least until I ran into that problem of a gimped reputation system.

												Holy crap is this game good. You play as a mercenary in a war-torn land, you have to build your warband for what-ever purpose you see fit, be it pledging service to one of the nations, earning big money or protecting villagers from bandits. It's a melee based game, but it has archery, crossbows throwing weapons and horses in it - and it's great. It has huge battle of 100 or so fighters, charging each other - and that is when you feel powerful. In games like Skyrim and such, you'd feel powerful if your the juggernaut with the huge hammer, but in this game your powerful when those juggernauts crack skulls for you.If you like melee-combat, medieval stuff, action-RPGs, strategy and so on - get this game, you'll love it.

												Game goes on forever and you can't ever really advance and actually see any gains. Takes forever to grow an army even on easy difficulty. Most of the things that would improve this game are sold separately as a completely different game (warband) and any further improvements to the game will probably be sold as stand alone new games.

												I kinda hate this game. I had had it for less than a week when it drew me in. I hate the controls, the AI, and the constant running around. But I love the concept of the game, it's amazing and  unique. It's got a simplified version of a lot of what I was looking for in a game. I could control armies, plunder villages, get my own fiefdoms. Pretty good game. But I hate what it's done to me.			"

												This game is so much fun. I like it better than warband because the combat is simpler and the whole game is simpler over all. Its fun playing and then having your fortunes suddenly reversed. I was playing with an army of 150 and then all the armies from a single kindom surrounded my city. It was a bitter fight between me and my 200 strong garrison on one side an 1250...needless to say I lost and they destroyed my lands. I allied with their enemy and set about exterminating them from the map in revenge. So much fun.			"

												A little strange. I haven't played it a whole bunch but I got the gist. The game has to plot, it's sandbox and fairly open world. It's not a huge world but you can go basically everywhere. The point of the game is to do whatever you want. You create your character and then, poof, you're set free to do whatever. You can choose a faction to be a part of and gradually work your way to the top. You can go free lance and kill everybody. It's an interesting concept but it left a little to be desired.			"

												There's nothing better than a good old shanking simulator! And Mount and Blade is just that! Mixed with RPG and FPS mechanics, mount and blade can render giant battlefields filled with hundreds of units no problem! Even on lower end systems it can handle it's own unit count extremely well. The textures are a bit dated, and the animations are slightly rigid, but that doesn't matter much when you've just defended your castle against the odds. A must have if you run into a spare 20 bucks!			"
