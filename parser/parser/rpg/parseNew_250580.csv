												Let's neglect the fact that the original dev was a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥to everyone.  Let's neglect the fact he raged like a child for a simple fixable reason and said some messed up things on twitter.  Let's neglect the fact he outright cheated the original music composer out of pay, after he put personal pursuits on hold because he was told he'd get paid.  Let's neglect the fact that the game got taken down off steam, bought out by a new publisher, and brought back to steam.Its still an obsolete version of Ziggurat.  While there are differences, in just about every regard Ziggurat is a superior game and your money would be better spent on that.  This game was enjoyable for the nonexistant price of a humble bundle game, but I can't recommend spending any more than $5 on this.			"

								 How this got onto Steam is beyond me, every sound effect sounds like it's either been lifted from TBOI or a freesound site and there's seemingly 10 items tops and I managed to go into the exact same room layout (and enemies) 4 times in one level. I'm glad I got it with the Humble Bundle because if I'd actually paid money for it I'd feel a lot more cheated. It hopefully will become worth playing over time but I don't know why games can't just be worked on and basically finished before being thrown out, the entire thing screams first-game-made-in-Unity and is trying way too hard to be The PainKiller Doom Binding of MineQuake.

								The game had lots of promise, and planned features that won't ever see the day. The developers, in the steam store page, say ""We're planning to add multiplayer co-op in the very near future.."" and now they have scrapped that feature entirely without any sort of compensation to the people who bought the game for this exact reason. Do not buy this game. Do not support Code Avarice (the developers) in any project they choose to move on to. They've taken our money and they've abandoned their game.As for the actual review:Pros: Rogue-like FPS.Cons: Very shallow. Clunky movement. Everything feels the same after playing for 5-10 minutes. There is just so very little content that it is insulting to call it a Rogue-like.			"

								Disclaimer: This review is for an Early Access game, which has changed since this review was written. I have no interest in reinvestigating the current situation, so take it with a grain of salt. The developer has released updates since this review was posted. The game itself is not bad. I've found it decently enjoyable. Not a huge amount of replay value, but I got to the end once. The problem with Paranautical Activity is the developer.The developers have continuously insulted and mocked people who bought their game. In addition, they have been less than honest. The game was marketed for over a year as having co-op incoming (and as of this review, the store page says the developers are still working on it), yet that feature was suddenly canceled. The developers insist they have been working hard on bugfixes and content updates, yet have not released anything, even missing a promised deadline by over two months (patch is yet to be released as of this review). Furthermore, the devs have been silent on the forums (when not aggresively insulting the people who bought their game) and insist you should visit their website, where they will keep people updated; visiting their webiste reveals no new news in two months, and the last message was just an apology for a delay (that has still not been resolved). And when fans have the nerve to say they aren't being treated fairly? The devs say people are ""entitled."" Do not buy this game, do not support this kind of rude immaturity from developers, do not support Early Access games that are deceptively marketed.			"

								Wow! I did *not* expect this game to be so addictive and absolutely satisfying. A long-overdue and well-executed fast-paced, circle-strafing, old school twitch shooter feel with a lot of elements very much like Binding of Isaac (a very good thing, and I mention the likeness only to its credit.) Different starting characters/builds with different stats and starting weapons to choose from, randomized/procedurally generated rooms and floors, health/armor/gold/bomb drops off enemies, shops on each floor, tons of unique personal upgrades to buy or earn at the end of each floor, etc. With even more content to come, and co-op multiplayer on the way (dear god yes!), I haven't been this pleased with and addicted to any indie title since FTL.Most importantly, the core controls and mechanics are an absolute joy. The pace and precision of the controls and the action feel absolutely spot-on. This is something many games destined for mediocrity have overlooked in lieu of trying to do everything else. When it comes down to it, the core mechanics, the precision and pacing of the controls of any shooter are at *least* half of what we either enjoy or can't stand about them. And more often than not, we barely even consciously realize that, if at all. Paranautical Activity absolutely nails it in terms of *exactly* how a shooter like this should feel, and it's a feel that is too rare these days. As a pure gaming experience, this one is a huge breath of fresh air. Bravo!			"

								would have expected more content from this game after 10 or more tries the rooms just feel the same, hasnt been a memorable update to the game if there even is one. only thing that sames to keep you going are the boss fights plz give some other incentivesways that would improve the experience as follows;- Make the main menu more presentable just looks quickly hashed right now.- More weapon variety and costumization with weapons than the 4 you can use now.- Give the world of Paranautical Activity a personality e,g charm, character instead of a dark dreary boring rooms even binding of isaac has personality not only through it's art style but through menus/enemies/environment etc.- Don't ever resort to normal text font for the shop items or anything other than your own, if it isnt worth it to you it isnt worth it to people to play.- continue with the funny name approach with the guns- update more regularly atleast month to month bases if it cant be done weekly or alternate weeks.(more reason for people to play everytime there is an update)- maybe even the option to play with friends online/local co-op through the game (easier said than done i know)at this place in time i hope it gets improved but right now it isnt really worth it to playthe points are coming from a fellow artist and game developer wishing better for this game			"

												I should probably have seen the Early Access reviews before purchasing it, but this is where you get a bit more savvy about positive reviews than negative ones.And frankly, this game isn't too bad. It's just not... fun and doesn't feel too interesting. Think Doom and Binding Of Isaac, but with a worse Health system, weapons that feel powerless at times, and surprisingly bad frame drops at times.Paranautical Activity (Deluxe Atonement, for its re-release after the minor controversy), is a rogue-lite FPS game, that seems to take notes from Doom and Binding Of Isaac. Yet, it seems to do it in ways that work against the game. While it does use some of the things (fast paced shooting, randomized rooms and floors, varying stats on each character), it doesn't use it well.Weapons feel quite good to use, although some of them feel rather weak. The shotgun, from my point of view, felt like the biggest let-down of all the weapons, with the bow being powerful and one or two-hitting enemies, with no problem.Power-ups feel nice too but with next to no proper explination as to what they do, when you pick them up, leave you to guess what they do, for whatever situation you're about to plummet into, with said power-up.Enemies are... alright. Mostly tedious to deal with, since some range from simple ""fire a bolt, wait for a while, rinse and repeat"" to ""'bullet hell'-like spam"". Surprisingly, the most annoying enemy I faced was the floor sharks. Why? Tank-y characters can't dodge well, and with the floor sharks, I've ended up being juggled by them, shooting them with a shotgun that did abysmal damage, until I either died or completed the room that way.Levels are pretty much the same square box, with randomised preset props, and enemies are dumped in when you enter. Nothing to write home about, except for what could amount to some problem with moving under staircases. Ended up getting stuck there, which has broken the flow of gameplay, quite a lot. There also seems to be some odd dissonance with the enemies that spawn in some rooms? Sometimes you get enemies who spawn in there, who get stuck in parts of the level geometry and just kinda... sits there.The characters have different spawn weapons, health and speed, meaning that you have some variety in what you can do and can't do. And by variety, it boils down to how far you can get with the fast characters. I mentioned above that the tank-y characters are slow, and even the extra health they have, just makes them a sitting duck until they die. Along with some of them getting weapons which would be ideal for fast characters, since they promote ""attack-retreat"" tactics, they work against the character, requiring them risk taking hits, which they most likely will, to pump in shots that don't feel like they do much. Compared to the bow or the sicle, the shotgun feels like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol you throw out the window, as soon as you see anything remotely non-pistol like.The bosses are... okay. They look interesting, but their design and looks are pretty much meaningless, since most of them just fire shots are you, non-stop until they spawn enemies or do some third thing that makes them slightly different from each other. And, honestly, they could be interesting if most of them didn't feel like the same boss. They just move around the area and shot, not really doing anything else, than the animation their set. Which sucks, cause the bosses I fought, looked really interesting.The game itself, is it worth it, even after all that I complained about? For some people, if you've run out of rogue-lite games, akin to Ziggurat, it could be. If there's some more tweaks to the game, such as a revamped health system, characters and weapons being buffed, as well as some changes to make bosses less dependent on luck or power-ups, it can be a very fun game. Also the font is pretty damn ugly to look at, in the menu. And the menu looks really amateurish, which is kinda sad, considering a lot of indie games do a lot to make the menus look presentable.Was I satisfied with the product? No. I felt like I bought a game that could've benefitted from more time in Early Access, especially now that we have a new dev team who works on the game. Hopefully, some future patches can make them game more fun to play and less annoying to deal with.Do I recommend it? As you saw above, I don't. If you want to jump into the genre of rogue-like or rogue-lite or whatever the cool kids call it, look for a game like The Binding Of Isaac, Ziggurat, or look up some games within that genre on your own. If you really want it, prepare for a game that you may dislike or find too tedious to keep playing.			"

								""Yes with an if, no with a but""?  I wish there was a ""sort of"" review recommendation option.  If you watch one single video of the game for more than 10 seconds - congratulations you have seen every single thing it will ever do.  What's good about it is actually quite good - the old-school movement and shooting - but it's so incredibly thin on content and doesn't quite nail the execution well enough to recommend it.  I feel like someone needs to sit these people down and explain three things to them very clearly - 1.  Your game is really not interesting or varied enough to have the rogue-like No Saving Permadeath concept attached to it yet.2.  If you are going to go shallow as a puddle, execute the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it - movement and shooting should be like butter, not kind just 70-80% there and rough as♥♥♥♥♥♥at times.   If you are going to go for random procedural stuff bigtime, you need an awful lot of it, not just the same rooms and enemies over and over again.3.  Please go and play Robotron some more until you understand points 1 and 2.			"

								yay reviews i can finally stand on a soapbox and preach my opinions to nobodyI want to like this game, I really do. I remember playing the earlier (alpha) versions and thinking, ""man this could actually be something with more active weapons and varied level design"". I personally cannot stand the music at all (it's incredibly obnoxious) and plenty of people criticize it for using voxels because MINECRAFT, but I looked past those faults because I really liked the gameplay. However, the devs get so close yet end up so very far away from realizing the potential of this game with every update - add more enemies but don't add more attack patterns for already existing enemies, switch from random weapon spawn to classes but remove difficulty via adaptation in the process, add more bosses but don't fix the fact that bosses either spin around in a circle or incessantly +forward into you, finally add being able to hold a second weapon but make it a fixed ""superweapon"" that you can't switch out from, etc.The game screams ""I WANT TO BE A GOOD DOOM AND ROGUELIKE HYBRID BUT MOM AND DAD WON'T LET ME BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE A CONTROLLER (which completely defeats the purpose of the free movement currently exhibited in the game)""			"

								Take Doom. Now turn the health into hitpoints, turn the graphics into blocks, turn the background music into dubstep, partition the levels into rooms, generate those rooms randomly, and toss in some upgrades you can buy in a shop, and I think that's Paranautical Activity in a nutshell.If this sounds like you'd love it, I urge you to check the forums, since the game is essentially ""finished"" according to the developer, which not everybody agrees with. I have no opinion on that -- what I do have an opinion on is whether I like PA, and the answer is no. Playing it just reminds me of better shooters I'd rather be playing, better roguelikes I'd rather be playing and better music I'd rather be listening to.			"

												Voxel FPS with Quake-y movement and randomly generated rooms.  Movement is good, but shooting is unsatisfying.  Rooms are randomly generated, but there isn't a lot of variety and floors/runs end up feeling the same in the end.  Menus look rushed/unfinished.  In the end, it's a shallow game that is alright for the first few goes, but fails to introduce any real variety.Don't buy it.			"

Early Access Review
								I've never really been one to play shooters. But then again, I was born into the N64/PS era, and didnt get into gaming until the GC/PS2/Xbox era, by which time Doom, Quake, and UT had run its course. So i've never really been able to experiance the ""twitch shooter"", only the tryhard big-budget military horsecrap.Until now.This game has what most modern shooters don't: a sense of speed, INCREDIBLY tight controls, and... dare I say it... fun? This is the most fun I've had in a while, probably since i was a starry-eyed kid playing Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. Enough exposition, let's get into it.This game doesnt seem to have a story, except what you can glean from the enviroment, the enimies, and the title of the game. Here's what I've discovered (speculated) so far... (i've only made it to level 5 at this point) you are onboard a nazi submarine filled with demons and demonic sea life. Why? Who knows... and who cares? Just stop thinking and shoot what moves.Speaking of shooting, the gameplay. Its just sublime. Sublime, and insanely difficult. This game follows up on its promise to harken to rogue-like games (is that how you say it?), with randomly generated floors (specific rooms are premade, but increase in variety as you progress), a Spelunky-esque shop, and a powerup system that brings to mind The Binding of Isaac. The game features permadeath, dying will restart you at floor one. Do not pass go. Paranautical Activity has several different classes, each with its own primary gun, maximum health pool, firing rate (an attribute determined more by the gun than the character), and movement speed. From the shotgun toting Tank, to the Insanely quick but flimsy David Bowie (armed only with a crossbow), there is a playstyle for all kinds of people here. Regardless of your class, all of the primary weapons in the game have infinite ammo, which i personally enjoy, as this game is stressful enough without having to manage it.When you're not shooting in PA, you're going to be running and jumping for your life. All enemy attacks are either projectile attacks with travel time or rushing you down in melee. Mostly the projectiles. You are tasked with avoiding damage at all costs, which can become rather hectic in later stages of this game. Your character, regardless of class can jump a good hight, and changes directions midair on a dime.The Graphics are kind of minimal, but I really dig the lighting system. All ingame models are voxel-based, with the enviroment textures looking similar to old-school Doom games. The Soundtrack is surprisingly good, and fits the game well, albeit being a bit repetitive.All this, and the game is still in beta, and it can only go upwards from here. The devs are talking about adding in co-op (PRAISE THE LAWD) as well as finetuning the gameplay experiance.This game does have a few bugs. Which is to be expected, as it is a beta, but bugs and minimalist graphics cannot hold back this pure, unadultered, virgin, twitch shooter experiance. Even in its current incomplete state, this game is an easy 8/10, and with solid netcode (fingers crossed), greater room variety early, and maybe a few more playable classes (one that starts with the M4!?!?) this could be propelled to a 9.5 to a 10, easily.THAT BEING SAID. This game is not for everyone. It is difficult. Its inherent mouse acceleration can be very tough to get used to. If you dont like shooters but like Rogue-Likes you wont like this game. If you like shooters but hate Rogue-Likes, you probably wont like this game. In my honest opinion, this game is pointed at a very specific pocket of gamers, which quite honestly I see as a good thing. Too many game devs these days (mostly AAA ones) are spending way too much time trying to appease everyone (which is impossible) which simply results in a watered-down product, a shadow of what it could have been. YOU WILL NOT SEE THIS HERE. If you dig a challenge, love old-school movement-based shooters, AND like the randomless of Rogue-Likes... welcome home.			"

												This is an abuse of Early Access system. It is not polished, it has many bugs, it has really poor optimization. And the devs first mocked with people, then mocked with Gabe. then got kicked out, then sold the game to a different publisher in its unfinished state.Yeah aim of the developers is not reached since they lack basic courtesy. Anyway, what was that aim? It was simply replicating BoI in FPS setting. Shops, bombs, most of the skills and upgrades were designed on this. This is not bad, since BoI is really fun, but this does not add anything original to the genre either. Every addition came from some other roguelike, e.g Ghost from Spelunky. It is good knowing that developers also like the games I like and many likes, but a collection of features from some well known very well executed games to build a buggy, unfinished mess is completely different thing.What is the original side of the game? To be fair it has two. First, its art style. User interface and menus are poorly designed, and game plays like the worst possible Unity example once can imagine, so expect stutters when passing through different menus. But in game voxel art is not that bad, and it feels unique. Also the soundtracks are not that bad, and distinct from other roguelike games. But being unique is not always a good thing, check some gameplay videos first, you may not like dubstep at the end.I am not a good FPS player, so I did not reach past floor 3, but it is not necessary to finish the game to see that this game is abandonware. Any obvious no brainer bug will be there until eternity while new publishers find publishing the new version with a gameplay video and a pdf file rather than some content wise and bug crushing patch.If u LOVE FPS and also LOVE binding of isaac, u may enjoy this a little, if u also are good with ignoring its bugs. If your feeling towards one of those two is more mediocre, u are advised to go and play some other FPS-roguelike. I can also advice you some other FPS roguelikes, since I have tried many:- Ziggurat-Tower of Guns- Fancy Skulls			"

												This game gave me a massive case of ""meh"".People keep saying this is like Doom and Binding of Isaac. I have Hundreds of hours between those three games (Doom 1 2 and BOI) and this is nothing like those. Not every FPS with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics is like Doom (BTW doom was not a Volumetric Pixle game it used sprites and was the graphical equivalant of Crysis for its time) and not every Rogue-lite is like Isaac (which is the KING of Rogue-lite).Combat feels slow and boring (strafe, shoot, rinse, repeat), I mean you have to keep moving but it does not feel fast paced, just lame. The optimization is poor at best. Someone explain to me why skyrim runs at 4k resolution no problem but this game bounces between 50 and 600fps constantly. Weapons are uninspired and EXTREMLY limited. Powerups require cash and you rarely have enough for anything decent unless you save and gimp yourself. If you want a FPS rogue-lite that doesnt run like crap and play like an autistic version of the two games everyone seems to be equating this to, try Eldritch. Or if you want to truly play a game like Doom or Isaac, just get those games, they are both infinitely better.			"

								Paranautical Activity is a game that combines Doom with Binding of Isaac. Which is a good concept in theory, but it's execution is disappointing. The problem is that it removes most of what makes Doom and other twitch fps so good. It misses cool weapons and enemies. Also the level design is bland. It's basically Binding of Isaacs boxes attached to each other where you clear a room to go to the next one until you find the floor exit. So no keycards and secrets. The room design is really bland. Same goes for the presentation. It's voxel style graphics just don't work for this game. Also the music is annoying. Hopefully in the future some company picks up the concept and does a good execution.			"

												Not balanced at all, some bosses have attacks that are too random or there are too many projectiles to even dodge.  Has hardly been updated over the half a year or so that I've owned it and would have been a waste of money if I didn't get it through Humble Bundle. It advertises the difficulty of BoI and Spelunky but in Binding of Isaac you can beat the whole thing with half a heart without taking a hit, it's all skill. This game requires you to be lucky and not get a boss who spawns eight different enemies that shoot projectiles faster than you can move and that you can't possible see at the same time because half of them will be standing behind you at any given moment.

								The developers are apparently not very friendly towards their player base, insulting them. They also have no professionalism whatsoever, choosing to communicate only through a twitter stream that is cluttered extremely with random off-topic comments. One of the devs seems to care more about streaming than development. They are hypocritical, being annoyed when being called diva devs while they have no issues insulting a portion of their playerbase for using a certain OS or making very unprofessional comments. If they encounter issues, they choose to blame everyone except themselves and not to inform the community through widely read sources nor easy to find back places.I wouldn't trust them with any money and I'm glad all money I paid through Humble Bundle went to charity rather than them. Let them prove themselves first before spending money on this.The game itself has potential and has decent game mechanics. That's the only good thing going for it at the moment...			"

Little introducion to the game and their developers:Very good idea and very fun game but sadly ""ditched"" from its developer due a discussion with Valve's CEO (Yes, Papa Gabe). After that discussion caused by Valve labeling the game as ""Released"" instead ""Early-Access"", the game got removed from steam and re-added 4 months after under ""Digerati marketing"" , a distribution company. But sadly since then (feb '15, and to be precise the last update it's dated Oct '14) the game hasn't been updated once.So, before further talking let's go on with the recension.Appearance:Graphics: 2/5Menu appearance it's not one of the best. Also in-game huds are way too ""simple"" in their appearance despite their ""Cubic 32-bit"" style. A graphical enhancement would be really appreciated.Sounds: 3/5Not so much to say about sounds, the music it's really nice but sorta repetitive during the whole floor, maybe add a boss and mini-boss music?Gameplay:Classes: 4/5Paranautical Activity grants the player a bunch of playable classes that can get unlocked by completing achievements and each one of them it's really different in their weapon and stats.Movements: 5/5The character it's really easy to control thanks also to items pickup that grants you the ability to double-jump etc.. Watch out for snowy levels and falling platforms! ;)Longevity: 3/5Not so much to say here neither, the game it's really fun but after a while playing it becomes slightly repetitive.Bugs: 2/5As already said in the introduction the was supposed to be an Early-Access instead of a release, it has a lot of bugs and glitch like Monsters getting stuck under staircases, double doors, glitch with powerups etc... But despite that i won't give a lot of weight to this voice because the game it was and still is a beta. OVERALL: 3/5Would I recommend this game? Yes. Would I recommend it for 9€? No.It's a really fun game but developers ditched it by not updating it anymore, It's a really nice mixture of Fps and Roguelike and definitely fun to play if you enjoy both genres. But still.. in its conditions it's not really worthed 9€ if you want to get it, i suggest you to wait until it'll be in sale.~Matt "

												I think the idea of this game is awesome. A nautical themed FPS roguelike. The graphics are nice pixel style. The music is good, if not a bit obnoxious. It's just that the execution is terrible. Every room feels the same. None of the enemies or bosses are fun. The variety of weapons is bad. You just strafe and hope around and hope you win.Go check out Ziggurat or Tower of Guns instead. Hell, even Heavy Bullets is miles ahead of this. Don't buy this unless it's on sale.

												Disclaimer: I love roguelikes of all types, and even I couldn't even enjoy this game.I thought maybe I'd give this game a shot, considering the hype surrounding it because of that dude.  Was hoping it'd be some kind of gem, something truly magical where I could understand why he was so upset.  I always try to refrain from crapping on other games because I KNOW how much work and love and time goes into them... but this game is bad.  The UI, the artwork, the generic electronic soundtrack, nothing meshes well, or feels like it belongs in the same universe.Gameplay wise, the movement speed is wonky and floaty, not in a good quake 3 sorta way.  There's almost zero weight or feel to anything, no way to tell how big explosion radius are, melee weapons are nearly useless, weapons dont feel good to use; I'm looking for redeeming qualities and I can't seem to find any; This game is an idea, it should still be in early access because it lacks zero finesse, polish, character or even just reason to play it.There's an entire steam store full of roguelikes and roguetypes that are worth your money, Tower of Guns  does a better job of what this game is trying to do, go play that instead. Do not buy this game, it's passable at best, do not give in to the hype.			"

												SKIP TO THE BOTTOM FOR TL;DR/PROS AND CONSBefore we begin, I'd just lke to say that I'm fully aware of the drama surrounding this game, and I don't care. Drama doesn't affect the game at all. Now, you might say the fact that the developers lied about multiplayer is something worth noting, but I would say it's not. Don't buy games based on the imaginary multiplayer mode that's not even in the game, this is grade school logic. Alright, without further ado, lets jump into this one.GAMEPLAY:So if you buy a rougelike, you're buying it for the gameplay, and Paranautical Activity has a decent ammount of it. Sure, a lot of the rooms and enemies feel very samey, but it's got this addictive trait to it. You basically go room to room shooting various enemy's, whilst collecting items and weapons to bolster your arsenal and defeating bosses. However, this game has absolutely God awful balancing, as if it was barely playtested. At the end of the day, I had a ton of fun with this game, but all that fun will be gone in an instant because of some absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.To start, there are certain classes that you cannot pick certain items up with. If you play as the Tank class, you CANNOT pick up ANY items that slow you down at all,  or you will be boned.  The enemies that just relentlessley follow you will be faster than you, and then you'll die, and there's no possible way to avoid this in certain rooms. In fact, for any class, any item that slows you down is a death trap. And some are comically underbalanced, ""Nine Armor and you get a speed reduction"" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. So since you  can't pick up any items that make you go slower, you might think this means you should only pick up items that make you go faster, but you can't. I had one playthrough where I was going so fast, I litterally broke the game. Like legit, I was so fast time in game would stop, but this just means the froze. The game refused to get better FPS and stop freezing, until I died, which is some ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I don't understand how the devs would let this slip through, one of the first things you should do is to  test what happens when you get all the items in the game.Another thing that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, is what I think is the final boss, Dhalia. This might spoil some things for you if you're one of those people who want's to be blind to everything, but I don't care. She litterally spawns in two or three of other bosses every thirty seconds, effectively flooding the room with bosses. And after you kill her spawned in bosses, there are no drops  from them, meaning you can't undo any damage they did to you. And as if this wasn't bad enough, Dhalia has many more hit points than any boss before her ever has. I would beat the other bosses in about 30 seconds flat, but I barely chipped Dhalia's health in that time. You're probably thinking ""Oh, look at this kid whine about how the game is too hard! Boo ♥♥♥♥in hoo!"" but I'm not whining about how it's hard, I'm whining about how it's unfair. It's like the devs knew that the player would be OP as hell by this point, so they just said ""♥♥♥♥ it, lets do all the bosses."" so the difficulty goes from a 5 to an 11. It's rediculous.STORY:I really have no clue on this one. You're on a boat, and there are demons and nazis for some reason??? I haven't beat the game yet, but nothing really follows the nautical theme. It's like the game wanted to be DOOM the rougelike, so it started doing that, then occasionally it remembers, ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm supposed to be nautical! Like sailors and such!"" And then it'll throw in a sea themed boss.  GRAPHICS:Meh. There's nothing to make them stand out, and it doesn't really feel artsy or like the game needed to be blocky. I mean I kind've like the style, but there are parts when the walls and floor will have high def looking textures that completely stand out from the blocky theme and it just kills it. I mean the models are all pretty good with the blocky style, but there's just not enough color to make everything pop, and even though it's cubes and such, it feels flat.SOUND:I don't know how to judge dubstep because I don't listen to it, but the sound isn't nautically themed that's for damn sure. I try to push it to the back of my mind, but there's maybe 5 soundtracks at max, so they just wind up being grating and annoying as hell. PROS:-Fun gameplay-Kind've like Doom-Decent boss variety-More or less uniqueCONS-Very unbalanced-Feels like no playtesting was done-Grating music-Almost no sense of game juice-Doom wannabe[D-]  -  If you really want this game, buy it on sale. About 5.00$ is a fair price, it's a good time waster, not much else. "

												Paranautical Activity was obviously intended to be some mixture of a 3D Binding of Isaac clone with Painkiller, and for the most part it succeeds in that. Player movement is fast and fluid, there's an interesting variety of weapons, and it offers a nice challenge and degree of skill-based gameplay. It lacks enough enemy and room randomization to have huge staying power as a roguelike, but what content there is definitely justifies the sale or bundle price if you're into the roguelike FPS subgenre. It's not as good as Ziggurat but better than heavy bullets. Voxel graphics look decent, soundtrack is pretty crappy but easy to ignore or mute, I haven't encountered any major bugs, overall I'm pretty pleased with it. Paranautical Activity may not be a great indie game, but it's a solid one, and for the reasonable price of admission I think that's enough.			"

								Paranautical Activity is a tribute to rougelike games, such as The Binding of Isaac. Weilding numerous items to find and several unique ""characters""/starting loadouts, there is a wide array of ways to play the game which makes the game fun and the music makes it far more enjoyable.However, being that the developer is underfunded and has some poor PR skills, I warn you to take caution when buying this game and (possibly) from this developer. Why? Well, the seemingly important feature of multiplayer has been cancelled (and aware that it wasn't going to happen around 2 months after 1.8 patch was announced) with no official announcement on the community hub or the official site (Code Avarice), instead announcing it through Twitter and streams (Source - 5th comment with replies: http://codeavarice.com/post/85125508953/by-mike-paranautical-activity-will-be-receiving-2#disqus_thread). This, combined with the long list of hostility towards the game's players due to impatient people demanding updates to the game is why I am giving this game a ""No"" recommendation. I look forward to the finished game, but the devs have a few things to learn.			"

												Okay so I finally decided to write a review on this game, keep in mind that I have about 8 hours of game-time but wasn't recorded due to me being offline.I will make the review as short as possible since I was not impressed at all and was so frustrated. The game Paranautical Activity is an FPS Rogue game that copies the style of binding of isaac, from the character voices, to the weapon description, the level progression and more, which I think is great but sadly they screwed up something so bad.The Good Fast-paced action, nice controls, easy to understand weapons and items.Nice enemies, good level progressions, replay-ability, a lot of secrets.The badThere are some levels that just throws the game for me and sadly you have to go through some of them ""random luck"" to finish a run, they're the dark room levels, your vision is dead, the rooms are TOO DARK I get it they tried to add a horror factor and maybe copied the idea of the shadow curse of binding of isaac but they did it so bad, this is FPS you cant make it impossible to see the floor around me and the enemies thats so dumb.So many times I had an op run I was killing bosses so easily, but then I encounter the dark levels and I die from normal enemies because I cant see them.All you can do is keep on jumping and shooting around like a maniac hoping you might see the red glowy small light that some enemies have, but eventually die because its almost impossible to see them coming, this really REALLY threw the game for me, reached the point where its not even funny anymore I just barely finish those levels by jumping constantly, then next floor ? Same level ...There are a lot of bugs in the game, I keep getting glitches every time I start a new run that brings up the menu and doesn't go away ""I think they tried to force pause the game so you cant move while the level starts but screwed up"" The music is REALLY good but even at my best headsets they do sound a bit ...static I guess ? or maybe thats how they meant to do them, I don't know.The game could have so much more but it ruined all of that with the shadow levels it just threw the entire game out of concept, ruined my experience, made the game unbelievably frustrating and I just had to alt+f4 when I got 3 dark levels in a row. Short version If you're ok with playing this game with the dark levels that will frustrate the hell out of you, get this game on the current 1.99$ price sales, dont get it full price.			"

								Great game, if it were being updated regularly. Slow updates plague many genres like this, and while I may have bought this game I do not reccomend this game for anyone who is fans of ""roguelike-likes"", as you may be highly dissapointed right now with the level of content (many alpha/beta roguelikes suffer from this) before finishing the game. There is little playability besides different weapons, which can (and should be) purchased from the shop on a playthough, and the enemies have little to no variation besides melee enemies, enemies with straight shot, and enemies with a slight homing shot. Needless to say, the devs need to change the, ""We're planning to add multiplayer co-op in the very near future, as well as a ton more content, and of course some bug fixes and polish.” to ""We're on Valve time only we're not Valve.""More seriously, promising content that trickles out very slowly (last update was in October, after I purchased the game) when being in the early access is little more than getting a functional beta with less than beta content. The game has nothing that sets it apart from many other alpha/beta Roguelike-likes either, leaving it barren, not to mention the graphics are currently (hopefully) developer art, and will be just a bit more developed, but I'm not holding my breath.

								It has a fairly large balancing issue where you're always better off as a tank than any other class and you suddenly get swarmed if you make it to the fourth floor, it has a fair few bugs a few alone related to the doors between rooms.It's a fun idea and all but it lacks any balance and requires a fair bit of bug fixing.The idea is good but the execution leaves a lot to be desired so you're probably better off spending any money you planned on putting into this elsewhere at present since it is far from a finished product.Other roguelike/lites are a much better use of time as it stands but if it ends up being made into something a bit more complee I'll be tempted to pick it up again.

												tl;dr: It's a bad game and it's not worth the price, buy Ziggurat instead.This game is a FPS with fast paced combat and randomly generated maps.The best way to describe the gameplay would be taking the the movement and gunplay from Quake and putting it in The Binding of Isaac, where you walk through randomly generated mazes constituted by many small arenas linked together.It's a great idea but unfortunately this game sucks.Even though the game is randomly generated it gets old really quickly since there isn't that many enemies or rooms. The lack of variety is evident ever since your first playthrough.Most of the weapons in the game feel rather powerless or too slow. Even when they're actually effective, like the demoman's grenade launcher, they still feel unsatisfying and awkward due to the lack of sound effects and impact. In my opinion this is a huge problem since most of the fun you could have with the game simply vanishes.There's not much to be said about the graphics and the sound either. It's pretty much what you see on the trailer, except not nearly as exciting.I also get a terrible headache everytime I spend more than 15 minutes playing it. That doesn't happen when I'm playing Quake or Ziggurat. Go figure.			"

												If this was the only dungeon-crawling procedurally-genrated permadeath FPS I've ever played, I'd probably recommend it. It has a strong style going for it—I admire that—but it just feels a bit mediocre, especially when compared to other games of this genre.The gameplay is really basic: murder bad things with weapons, run & jump & dodge, enhance your character with power-ups, and progress forward. This is all just fine, but there's not much that makes it stand out here, just like this paragraph!I understand the logistics in building the enviroments as cubes of equal size, but the designs within are so unimaginitive: too much symmetry and open space. There are a few areas that utilized space in all three axes quite well, but they are rather sparse. The voxel graphics and lighting are my favourite aspects of this game. The enemies are neato, and I especially love the minotaurs... woof, so sexy!I do like this game, but I don't recommend it because there's more fulfilling ways to spend time and money.			"

								Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game. The developers advertised the game as having certain prominent features upcoming for several months after they had cancelled development, leading to people buying the game under false pretences. Of course, early access games are always a risk, and things can change, but to continue promising a feature long after they have given up on it is not something that should be accepted or encouraged, even for an Early Access game. That isn't part-and-parcel of what we should accept from early access, it's outright misleading, and an abuse of the Early Access system.			"

												Paranautical Activity: Deluxe Atonement Edition is a rogue-like FPS game that takes elements and gameplay from Doom and Quake and couples them with a game like Binding of Isaac, however quickly falls flat. The game is terribly punishing with your small health pool and terrible weapon selection. The controls and gameplay are designed so that the player has to run around and constantly kite enemies hoping their shots will land and hit the enemies. The controls and gameplay are clunky and all the rooms the player goes through seem so repetitive as they are all boxes with different props and obstacles thrown in.  There are items that you can purchase to upgrade but the game does nothing to tell you what does the item do. Most of the time you just purchase an item only to find out that it has negative effects! Also, the difficulty of the game seems odd, some enemies and bosses are really easy and on the other hand some are really difficult. I did about 10 runs, and they were all very similar just with different bosses and the 2nd level boss usually takes me down each time. Looking at the Steam Achievements looks like only ~15% of the players even made it past Level 2 which just shows you how punishing and difficult this game is.			"

								This game has never really seen love. Just as the developers have never really shown love and in the middle of this conflict between the players and the developers is a game that had unlimited potential. It's a sad sight to see it die over something as lame as the dev's folding on the co-op support. For me personally, no biggie, yeah it sucks but that just means devs need to step up and deliver something spectacular to their backers for their own short commings on their promises. I understand the trials and tribulations that a developer goes through to see their vision come to life, another reason why it is sad to see it die but this is still no reason the devs need to go on the offensive or even the defensive as the backlash should have been expected from the community. A more inteligent tact would have been to go back to the drawing board, like maybe consider scrapping their developed engine because of it's short commings and using an outside engine, as there are a lot of free ones to choose from. The point is that, there were alternatives to how this could've been handled, but instead of putting their energy into fixing it, their efforts went into some kind of 'fight the community' damage control and broke it so bad that it is now unfixable. Thus, the world is less one good game. In all, the game wasn't half bad. It's a great idea but it needs a lot of polishing, the random generating algorithms need fixing and even though, technically that this game is still in early access (of which my review is based on) at this point, needing the polishing and fixes is not a good thing, as I have felt the heart leave this game a long time ago. I hate saying these words but ""I cannot recommend"".			"

												I cannot reccomend this game. I love first person shooters like Quake and Doom, and rougue likes such as Isaac a ton, so when I saw that this game was a mix of those with a cool art style, I eagerly purchased it. I regret not refunding it.This game  isn't fun, and, my god, is it slow. Games like Doom or The Binding of Isaac are fast paced, with constant action mixed into the strategy of play they demand, but this game, is  not that. Every room is a chore to get through, as it takes a few seconds to get into the action, which boasts a combat system with a  wide variety limited choice of weaponry that gives little diversity in game play. The combat itself is clunky and isn't satisfying to attack. Killing enemies is satisfying, but only in the sense that you'll be thinking ""thank god I finished this room, I can only hope that the next isn't the same thing"", and are slightly relieved to be done. Speaking of next rooms, they might as well all be the same. I feel as if I am not exploring or getting through an adventure, as I am doing nothing but repeating the same mundane gameplay of the last challenge. This game can be summed up in one word:  boring.Do not buy this game. Do not support it's jerk of a developer who wants to kill the guy who put his game up for sale. Do not encourage games like this to be made again. Do not waste your time or money. Buy The Binding of Isaac. Buy Doom. Buy Ziggurat. Buy Tower of Guns. Buy Devil Daggers. Buy almost any other game and you will have a better experience. ♥♥♥♥ this game. TL;DR Don't buy Paranautical Activity.			"

												     Another early access game gone astray, this game had so much potential till 1) the devs are the worst 2) sold out quick 3) released an unfinished game.      The grindy industrial music adds a lot to this epileptic bullet hell fps but everything else in this game is extremely lacking. Stylistically, this game is total garbage. There is no consistency to any of the art you find in the game and the ""nautical""  of this game is forced in to what seems like a random set of enemies. You're on a nazi ship and you'll find anything from moths to snails if you get the just. They only have two different room backgrounds they apply to rooms with different torch placements. Yes you heard that right two room backgrounds on a FINISHED GAME IN A GAME WHERE YOU ONLY GO INTO ROOMS. And the graphics oh my lord the graphics. These graphics looked like they were made by a 15 year old learning how to use voxel. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥are they just flat out terrible.      There is no such thing as balance in this game classes or items. That wouldn't be such an issue if there was such a thing as building your character but its all 100% chance based folks. That boss that gives you double jump which is essential? Well you are just about as likely to find a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss who gives you a garbage item. Wanna beat the game as the Tank? Well you might as well play bouncer because you don't need a speed up item or skill. OH BOY I got another dark floor item even though I didn't and will not get a single DARK ROOM.      Progressing in this game is like using a cheese grater as a fleshlight. You have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue if your build will win because you might just die to a totally random room because it was so ♥♥♥♥ing impossible.  Its almost like you're not even building to win, you are just building to hopefully surive to floor 7 MAYBE. The first playthrough where you think you're going to win is tarnished when you walk into a room and take 10 damage. This isn't even due to lack of skill, the devs flat out made layouts where if you don't see every enemy in the room and the room itself and react before 1 second 95% of the locations you try to run to will lead to 2-3 damage. Do you feel like you are making it anywhere with your build? No. Never. You seriously will get ♥♥♥♥ing destroyed sometimes and all your left with is why am I still playing this game.     This is game has its fair share of bugs, there are so many I don't even know where to begin.I swear the more rooms you enter the game gets laggier by the end so you might as well just not try to stock up. I've had so many fictitiously good builds and then I get to the last boss and it drops to one frame rate. The only poor soul I got invested into this game has a super computer and after it released as a full game it could barely run at 10 fps for him. Enemies will like the caustic dogs and the flipping monkey men will get caught on room obstacles constantly. Enemies in general will sometimes get stuck in walls and you are literally just trapped in a room and have to restart.      Don't even get me started on their cheesy excuse for an update. They somehow made the game worse and managed to overlook anything any player of this game might want. All I can imagine is the devs for this game sitting at a table thinking ""Lets make a floor type that ♥♥♥♥ing blows, a poor attempt at a hardcore mode, and a couple of new rooms that ARE TOTALLY UNBALANCED."". Well thanks devs thats about as good as an idea as sending death threats at Gabe Newell and losing all the poor souls paying too much for your game. The devs even made fun of the players of their OWN GAME on twitter. WHO EVEN ♥♥♥♥ING DOES THAT.     If you are looking to buy an fps roguelite don't buy this one. Please do not buy this. The devs are trash, the game will only ruin your hopes for what it could have been,  and it will give you a sezuire. Speaking from a player whos been playing since early access, it is not and it will never be worth your time sadly.			"

A controls screen! This game has a rediculous learning curve, and this is coming from someone who enjoys play Risk of Rain. This game gives you 2 choices: Either be tank, move slow, and do little damage, or die after 3 hits but be super fast. This game seems like it (I HOPE it) will be better later on, but at this point I cannot hesitate any more to suggest you to NOT get this game.			"

												As an FPS veteran, this is by far one of the most unbalanced and finnicky games I've ever played.All copious issues with the developer aside, the game ittself has an extremely weird and just plain annoying difficulty curve. For instance, Khan should not spawn on floor 1. On top of this, the bosses swing wildly from being way too easy to way too difficult. On top of that, the classes are unbalanced too! I could g on.As a blanket statement, this game, rather than being fun and challenging, will just leave you frustrated. I just can't recommend this unless you're a masochist.			"

								Well..... The game is ok, though it rarely gets any updates. The develpers also see it fit ban posts reporting some bugs in the game and in some cases constructive criticism. All in all the most annoying thing which the developers and the moderators of thier community hub have in the past, was give positive confirmation of multiplayer getting added, claimming for months that it would be in the ""next update"".  However this never happend because of a ""Technical issue"" even though they had been ""working"" on the game for almost a full six to eight months without a single update, bug fix, or patch. After which they claimed they never prommissed any such thing, instead of appologizing to thier customers. They have been one of the best examples of how a game development company should not be run. Ignoring feedback, false advertising, and, one of the worst things to do in my opinion, acting as if it isn't thier falt and not taking any blame about thier short-commings in thier developement. I Do not recommend this game to anyone, because nobody should support people like this and feed the ego of a delusional game developer. Especially one who can't even make a game that looks and feels like one a proper dev could make in the seven day fps competition.			"

								I feel somewhat silly for writing a review for an early access title with less than an hour spent on it, but I'll go ahead and put my thoughts out there anyway. I think I've cleared enough floors and played enough to really judge my experience.This title aspires to be a throwback to the '90s with an emphasis on constantly moving, strafing around enemies and shooting from the hip. You go from room to room, kill all the enemies within and make it to the boss of the floor before taking the elevator down to the next. Repeat this many times over, with the rooms that you fight in seeming very much the same and the annoying music blaring at all times.That is Paranautical Activity in a nutshell.A rougelike take on Doom/Quake this is not. In fact, with all the open seeming environments I was stuck in, it felt more like a grossly simplified voxel take on Unreal Tournament with much less mayhem and enjoyment. Needless to say, I don't quite like this game at the present. It may change for the better due to it being early access, but I think the core designs are already in place and the devs won't flip turn them upside down anytime in the future.At the very least, I didn't pay full price (a whopping $10) for this. I might be a touch more upset in writing this if I did.But it WAS the thing I was most looking forward to in the bundle, though...In closing, I wish the devs the best in improving this...experience and will give future players some advice.Do not stop strafing, ever. Pick the Tank class if you want a glorious boomstick. The David Bowie class does not have an ultimate move where he transforms into Ziggy Stardust and shoots lasers from a guitar.That is all.			"

												Paranautical Activity is a dungeon crawler FPS with arcade elements, it shares trashy dubstep music and voxel graphic with Dead Bits, the level construction and power ups with The Binding of Isaac and the fast paced gameplay with DooM and Unreal.Just like in The Binding of Isaac, this game plays on several different floors, each with rooms that have to be cleared before proceeding into the next room, each floor with two bosses, one of which is optional and rewards the player with an additional power-up.The graphic is quite simplistic, yet is nicely colourful and blends well with the very arcadish sound effects and the not-deplorable dubstep soundtrack.Regarding the soundtrack... I can't abstain from admitting that the quality isn't great: it's dubstep, raw, crude, pumping and absolutely ""videogame-like"". The final product is an OST that is hardly playable outside of the game, but if you let it run on background as you play, if you can bare with it for a while without getting an headache, it becomes a fantastic soundtrack that only makes you more and more eager to keep playing this apparently mediocre videogame.Paranautical Activity isn't for everyone, it's an hardcore game that will surely faze any casual gamer in matter of minutes: this game is unforgiving, it requires fast reflexes, great aim and ability to adapt to the new. The dozens of power-ups and the repetitive yet different level design can offer a new experience each and every new playthrough; on top of this, the player can choose up to six different characters, each with its own stats (such as health, speed, power, etc.).As final note, the customisation in terms of graphic and sound options is minimal, however, it is possible to modify the FoV (Field of View) from 30 to 150.If you need ratings:Graphic: 6/10Sounds: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Longevity: 8/10Overall 7/10Buy this game if you're an hardcore FPS player who enjoys dungeon crawlers and/or arcade games. Skip it if you don't have experience with FPS.			"

								I generally do not write a review for a game that I have not played at least five hours, but I made this an exception due to how easy it is to experience all there is within the first thirty minutes.I purchased Paranautical Activity out of curiosity during one of the Steam sales event.I obtained the game under the impression that it could be a nice pass time game allowing me to go on a rampage;the game definitely delivered in that aspect, I was given an environment and monsters to shoot at.The problem with this game, however, is the fact that the entire game seems to be just a showcase of an idea.Due to this very fact, I was no longer able to endure this game past the 25th minute mark.I do realize that this game is still in early development, but I would in no manner consider this a game.The definition of providing early access is to allow people to purchase the game and test it for the developers,with the fundemental qualification for an early access game being having most, if not all, of the core mechanics present.This was not the case.This game feels like it is showcasing the classes and the monsters, with overly simplistic menus with very lacking choices.This game delivered a functioning showcase, as I have yet to encounter a debilitating glitch,but other than the above point, there are several other problems I would like to point out:1) The game does not receive updates frequently enough.Out of the some eight months of owning this game, the game has yet to receive major function and mechanics update.The update frequency can easily rank just below the notorious Cube World.2) The classes are extremely unbalanced, for future update reference.I have been playing tanks most of the petty amount of time I have endured this game, as I was shown time and time again in the game that tanks somehow have amazing advantage in both offensive and defensive capabilities compared to many others. I could mow down all mobs regardless of the distance with just the shotgun.3) The game still does not have multiplayer functionality.The developer's blog did mention encountering problems on December of last year with creating the multiplayer function, but that was seven months ago.4) Despite randomized, the game has a very limited amount of mobs, rooms, bosses, and items.As such, the game was not very engaging, as within twenty minutes, the player may have already encountered every single possible instance. Hence why I could not hold my attention onto the game for even 30 minutes.Until the game performs a major update with multiplayer capability, and also have far more variety in its instances,I do not recommend purchasing this game.TL;DR:Ranging from instance variety and mechanics, the game is too lacking in too many manners.Until this game has a multiplayer function and an expanded library of instances, this game is not recommended.

								Interesting premise, but terrible developers. Quite honestly I find this to be the Amy's Baking Company dev team on Steam.UPDATE: Now, the game runs terribly on my system, which has no issues running many other games, with no issue. It suffers from input lag, choppy framerate, and lack of responsiveness. I cannot even open the game options.			"

Early Access Review
								Well, take this recomendation with a pinch of salt, the game is still early access (in a very advanced stage as devs say, though). I can't say I totally disliked the game, but there are too many things that wouldn't allow me to raise my thumb for this game. Here's some:- The overall presentation and menus look very rushed and unpolished, even for an early access game.- The music, oh god, the music.... - The total lack balance overall. Not only between classes, not only between enemies and you. - Dying feels often unfair and frustrating. I won't say how many thousands of times I've died in tons of other roguelikes, and yeah, there's a difference between dying by lack of skill and dying because the game is poorly balanced. The second option doesn't make a roguelike good, hard or anything, it makes it an unnecessary pain in the♥♥♥♥♥that any sane player should avoid.- No sense of progress at all. TBOI, Rogue legacy, etc.... they have a sense of achievement after each run. Doesn't happen in this game, and that's a no-go for me.So, I hope you find this list useful, and I really hope the devs work really hard to make a great game, because there's potential.  I haven't been playing too much, so some things could be missing. Anyway, the game is on Humble Weekly sale for 1$, if you feel curious about it just go and get it, it won't hurt.			"

								It sounded like such a great concept from the summaryTake a pinch of Doom-esq run/gun, some Spelunky random levels, and the often used basic rougelike elements in order to get the end product of Paranautical Activityhowever... once you get past the hype... its pretty dull for a gameit plays like a 3D ""bullet hell"" game with avatars in the ""cube based design"" that has been done to deathYou die a lot in this game, even for a rougelike its to the point of frustration. Not the good ""gah, I was so close"" of other titles like Spelunky. But the ""ugh, i died. Again."" repetitve slog that makes playing this game seem like a chore, more than some recreational gamingWhen the enemies are not busy spamming endless projectiles at you, or just swarming you, their combat stratagy shows a decided lack of polish and sophistication... In laymans terms: they are idioticYou go behind even the smallest of corners, with a small bit of your (unseen) avatar obscured... and its like you never existed. Or failing that, they will just spam a projectile at the wall in vain hopes of breaking it down (which will never happen)LONG STORY SHORTIt seemed like a good idea, but is nothing more than a disapointing money sink that you will play for a little bit and then uninstall.Do not waste your time or your money on this game unless you want all the fun of Calculus homework with inflated 16bit graphics			"

I think i will play it again."" I am not saying that this is what every person feels but its the way that I feel. This game IS worth playing and supporting. People say that the game is unfinished and isn't that good but I say try to maybe support the developer(s) in any way possible so this game could be more popular and fun! So I do recommend this game but I say come into this game with an open mind. P.S. The game is like a mix of The Binding Of Isaac & Legend Of Dungeon except its in first person.			"

												Alot of reviews hate on this game unreasonably harshly. This is in part from reviews when it was still in developement, or under prior ownership. Admittedly the designers of this game had some management problems and also did not deliver all of the things they promised (such as multiplayer support). What they did do is create a satisfying and addicting shooter. reasons for thisThe game is randomised for a different experience everytimeTONS of items, over 100 I believeOverall fun and FAST fluid play I could go into much more detail but it is only by playing the game for at least a few hours that you start to appreciate all the different items/powerups/weapons and how they can interact with eachother. An item that seems terrible 95% of the time may in some circumstance or combined with another become so powerful it is almost game breaking. This coupled with dodging and destroying hoards of 8 bit enemies all the while listening to pumping techno music is extremely satisfying.			"

Even though I have heard bad things about the forum, i still think this game has alot of potental. And now, a little bit about the game.-adrenaline pumping music-great boss fights, 2 per floor, one is optional-very helpful post-boss fight rewards-5 classes with different weapons and stats-several power ups-a couple refrences to other games-action!-in-game gift shops, one on every floor with different items-and last, but not least, giant flying sea turtles with mounted rocket launchersI hope this refiew was in the least bit helpful.

There are bugs from time to time, but it's in beta still, so that's expected. There has been one time there was a bug that made me restart, but I'm pretty sure that's since been patched. My only gripe about the game is some item abilities are unclear, but aside from that it's great, mindless fun.			"

								[First of all, let me just admit that I know the programmer of the game personally. I talk to him online all the time, and I've hung out with him. This does not affect my opinion of the game in the slightest. If I thought the game was bad, I wouldn't be writing this.]Paranautical Activity is a first-person shooter roguelike set on a nazi U-Boat. If you like shooters there is plenty here to enjoy, if you like roguelikes there's even more, and no two runs will likely ever be the same. Being a roguelike, each of the eight stages is filled with procedurally generated rooms. These rooms are filled with an increasingly difficult selection of enemies, along with a boss, a sub boss, a shop, and bonus rooms with various bonuses and challenges. Each floor is also a race against the clock to beat the the boss and progress before an unkillable phantom comes to hurry you along under threat of murder.There are several playable characters, each with unique play styles. Some, such as Gorton, require precision but do crazy amounts of damage; and others, such as Dy-No-Mite, allow for a more loose play style at the cost of self-destructive splash damage. There is a selection of super weapons that range from a ninja sword that wrecks shop up close, a cannon that demolishes most things, and a gun that uses its ammunition to create more health, bombs, and armor.There is a wide selection of items that can help you along (and more than a few that will make your going much tougher). Some can make you immune to explosions. Some can basically remove the cap on your rate of fire. Some can give you much more health at the cost of your speed. Some can make all floors dark. Some can do nothing other than change your character's injured sound to a selection of girlish ""Ooches"" and ""Ouches.""The varied enemy design ranges from rocket-propelled turtles that fire missiles, glowing monkeys that jump back and forth between the floor and ceiling, and sharks that hunger for your feet. Bosses range from a pair of flying eyeballs that divide themselves when they die, a battleship with kamikaze planes circling it, and a nazi scientist that can resurrect the dead.Though the game doesn't officially release until around halloween, the final content patch just went live a few hours ago, so I feel comfortable finally officially recommending this game to anyone who enjoys the concepts behind it's design. If you like shooters, I recommend this game. If you like roguelikes, I definitely recommend this game. If you like games that marry the two concepts, then I can't imagine why you wouldn't love this game.			"

								Decent game as it currently stands in its phase of development. It's essentially an 3D FPS Binding of Issac in gameplay sense.  Apparently they are in the works of adding a coop mode and achievements, so that will add some more fun to the game in the future. However, currently there is not much room for replayability other than beating the game mutliple times with different characters.  All characters are unlocked at the beginning, there are no item unlocks for doing certain things, no unlockable bosses, one final boss, and no story.  Played it for about 5 hours and probably won't play again until they further update it. As it stands, great Early Access game and I recommend you getting purchasing it when it is on sale for ~$3 or less!			"

												Well, that's 5 minutes I'll never get back.Turn off the obnoxious music and work around the barely-implemented gamepad support and you'll be taken aback by a game in which graphics, sound and design are so sparse you'll barely have time to notice that the insta-spawn enemies have chewed off half your health bar. There's no ceremony, grace or learning curve to this game, and anything that isn't painfully bland is simply working to disadvantage the player.At least it came with 2 much better games.			"

												The enemys for this game are usually pretty easy and often involve just simply moving left or backwards to get away from most of their attacks but there are other enemys like the skull and the moth that you need to look out for and the skulls are pretty easy too but if you have low speed (and you often will) they can sneak up on you and deal massive damage. The moths are what you need to look out for because there shots home in on you and these shots WILL hit you and the WILL lower your health to zero eventually if you don't concentrate on dodging there shots these two enemys aren't that bad but they're the only really difficult enemys in this game.Bosses are strange some bosses are easy and basically the only way to get hit by the easy ones is if you stop circle strafing around them.The only bosses you need to look out for are the ones with homing shots because they fire a lot and if you aren’t glued to a wall and moving fast your dead for sure. The other hard bosses are the ones that melee you because those ones fly right at you and deal damage and if you aren't moving fast and jumping constantly your dead for sure. However if they aren't FLYING towards you and are just something like a skeleton or something they aren't a problem at all.So bosses and enemys are alright just might need to change a few of their attacks to make the easy ones harder (recommended change) or the hard ones easier (not recommended change)  to stop making the easy boss fights feel like a circle strafing chore.  Now lets look at the bad part. The items often horribly unbalanced and some items being flat out jokes that do almost nothing is AWFUL.There is one item in this game called Doxxy that will put me off this game until it gets removed completely. The item changes the sound that you hear when you get hit. That’s. It. You went through an entire blue skull room boss fight where it was that moth with homing shots and you barely made it out alive? Well here’s this completely useless item! You saved up all your money to buy an item in the shop? Well this item is free! It's also useless and takes up 1 of 3 slots in the shop! You only get to items in the shop this time! Should have gotten lucky and had a random dice power up drop so you can reroll this item. There are so many items that just plain suck. The one that flips gravity when you jump (makes the billion jump upgrades useless cuz you can't really jump anymore)Doxxy The one that permanently lowers your speed for a couple of very temporary armor pieces (speed is essential if you aren't going fast then you WILL easily get your health gradually lowered to zero by moths and stuff. See above where I mention that speed is important to fight the bosses and enemys.).  Rage which is a damage up when you kill enemys! What could be wrong with that? Well, it's also a damage down. It is many damage downs. Every 10 seconds or so it lowers your damage by 0.083~ I think and when you kill enemys it increases damage by the same amount lowered so if you aren’t constantly instakilling enemys then you are losing damage. You can't insta kill with this item because its lowering your damage. Not to mention the item pickup tip for rage simply says ""Damage up for killing enemys"" and doesn't mention this damage down I'm glad I looked at the pdf file supplied that explains items. If I hadn't done that I would think this item was good!Same with Fool, an item of which simply says ""doubles damage"" on pickup and doesn't mention that enemys deal double damage too! I could imagine myself spending hours ingame with the fool item dying quickly and not realizing it was fool's fault. (Fool is a good item because of an item called kamikaze which turns those normally useless bombs your carrying into armor and deals damage to enemy that melee you. The downside to kamikaze is that it completely removes your health so if you don't have any bombs and you get hit you die. The whole idea behind kamikaze is that if you now spend health to shoot bombs but bombs require so many upgrades that you wouldn't be shooting them even if you didn't have kamikaze. I would often find myself getting kamikaze and running around with 40 bombs that I wont use because I have 40 health and it would take so long to get me to zero that the final boss is a cakewalk. I could even take fool to insta kill everyone and it would STILL take a long time to die. bombs are more plentiful then hearts as you can blow up explosive barrels get a 3 hp up at almost any time. The other way of getting health is to take some health upgrades. The two I found were this one that doubles your health but lowers your speed. Because your speed is lower you are going to get hit easier and speed ups are so rare that this is never worth taking. The other just gives you two health and some armor which helps but both of these are nothing compared to kamikaze.  I would say that kamikaze=win and if you don't get it you will have so many awful items thrown at your way that it's basically restart for kamikaze.I can name a lot more if I look at which item does in the little pdf file that says what every item does but that would be boring to see me explain why almost every item you find is bad. So a few items are good and the majority are bad.The point of item systems in roguelikes are that these items change gameplay and keep it interesting and a lot of these items have potential but are so imbalanced that they aren't worth taking and it turns the game into a restart early to get good items fest which is bad because this means that all your runs are the same because your taking the same items every time. This run is the same every time feeling is magnified by the low number of rooms the made for each floor. The number of rooms they made are so low that I found myself memorizing enemy spawn locations in only a few hours of playing.Because of the sheer amount of bad items in this game the devs have a lot of stuff to fix. I heard that they are spending most of there time right now adding net co-op but I'd say if you wan't to fix this game then ditch the co-op idea for now and spend all your time on balancing these items and removing doxxy. I got this game on sale for 3 dollars and it's so bad because of the item system. I don't think this game is even worth 3 dollars as pressing the restart button over and over again isnt fun. If I wanted to press the same button over and over again I would just play cookie clicker.TL;DR \/\/\/\/\/Pros+FOV slider goes from 30 to way to high+music is niceCons-enemys are easy except for one or 2-bosses are either easy or really hard and there's only 2 or 3 hard bosses. -The items are so bad that it encourages restarting -music is nice but it isn't tied to floors or rooms or anything it's litterally like they just took some youtube playlist and put it in the game. There is no boss fight music-I met the system requirements but expereinced harsh lag on lowest graphics because when you kill things the fall into a million cubes some times on later levels these squares become so plentiful that it becomes unbearable-game sounds are underwhelming. I looked at the credits and it had links to sites like freesounds which makes me feel like they just searched a shotgun sound . mp3 in google  and downloaded the first thing they saw-item pickup tips are helpful sometimes but other times don't mention a that an item has a secret bad effect. This encorages reading the pdf guide that comes with the game which means playing this game blind is a bad Idea-speed is essential for dodging and so many items lower this stat that most of the items become useless the game does have good movement but this good movement is gone if you take too many speed down items Yes, the only good thing about this game is the fov slider and maybe one or two of the enemys.

I rarely find games comparing themselves to The Binding Of Isaac and Spelunky meeting my standards but I enjoy this one a lot! I hope they (whoever that may be) continue to add updates regularly.

								If you like roguelike games, you should buy it! I know I haven't got much hours recorded, but don't forget, that this game was firstly released on Desura. So when I got enough from The Binding of Isaac. I mean I got enough from dying, and failing, I looked up on Desura, and found this gem. It's basically a BoI in FPS view, but if you play it more, and more, you slowly understand, that this game, is different. And when you hear MACAskill's perfect soundtrack for this game, which drives you even, when you are not in that mood, you will realise, that this game is awesome!Since it's in Early Access, bugs will occur, but it's already super fun! 3 words: BUY IT NOW!

								Takes me back to the days of Quake and Unreal Tournament. A wonderful game that takes some getting used to, but will definitely give you an adrenaline rush once you get the hang of it. 4.5/5.0.As a side note, while this topic doesn't change my view on the game so far, it still needs to be addressed: The devs really need to get to work on this. Promising Co-op in ""the next update"" more than 6 months ago and still not releasing it yet isn't a good move if you want to keep your consumer base. Don't get me wrong, the game is still great; it is still an adrenaline rush to play, especially on the later levels, but the lack of love from the devs, from the promised bugfixes to the approaching vaporware status of Co-op, really hinders what this game could achieve. All in all, if you're a fan of the twitch-action shooter, than PA is up your alley. If you're hestiant about buying the game though, I'd recommend waiting until the Co-op update is released before purchasing.			"

								Looking for a game that is challenging, but has similar feels to classic first person shooters like Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake? Then this game is perfect for you. Paranautical activity takes on a perfect random level generation feel like the game Binding of Isaac mixing it with room textures of Wolfenstein (hence the Nazi flags on the wall) making every time you play different from the last. In this game you take on a wide variety of unique enemies, bosses and power-ups as you progress through the games ever changing levels. The game is as far as I know is still in the early access stage, but it has very high potential for being a very good game and is relatively cheap. So if you want something fun that will get you stuck playing for a while, I encourage getting this game.			"

								Probably one of gthe most fun roguelikes to come out of the recent sort of roguelike craze. though the art is very minimalistic, it conveys what it needs to and doesn't go too far with the simplicity like many indie games tend to do. the combat is rock solid, and highly diverse depending on your class and weapons. There's a good amount of items with varying effects past direct stat upgrades, though they could definitely stand to have a description on the ui before picking them up for new players. the game may seem small at a glance, with only seven floors, none of which have a great amount of ""important"" rooms, though in gameplay it's actually fairly difficult to navigate and beat each floor.  tl;dr: game provides a solid, fun experience with plenty of replayability, well worth its full price even.

								I would describe ""Paranautical Activity"" as a mixture between ""The Binding of Isaac"" and classic first-person shooters. PA is extremely fast-paced, challenging, and sometimes terrifying. Like many other games of this type, you will find yourself fighting to clear rooms of enemies and eventually defeating the main boss. After the boss battle you will take an elevator to the next floor where the difficulty rises. From what I understand, you are on a Nazi ship with experimental creatures, and must fight your way to.. who knows where. The retro voxel graphics seem a bit overused these days, but it works fairly well. If you have had an urge to play this, I suggest picking it up to support development. If $9.99 is too much at the moment, go ahead and wait.			"

								This game, as it states, combines the classic FPS action of games like Doom and Quake, with the randomness and difficulty of modern roguelikes like Binding of Isaac and Spelunky. It may be difficult to start, but you will find yourself getting the hang of it within a half hour to an hour of gameplay. So good.			"

								WHat do you get if you combine the Player movement found in Quake III, add Voxel graphics and elements of a Rougelike? You get THIS little pearl of an FPS-Shooter that plays itself what could be described as Binding of Isaac with Guns in First-Person.While it is Early Access it already provides a TON of fun and a truly challenging difficulty that is made for those who seek an adrenaline-coaster of a shooter. You move and shoot very fast, but die even faster if you are careless!A fair warning to those that prefer a more ""easy-going"" shooter where you do not have to pay attention to every moving pixel on the screen: This game is not for you. It is REALLY fast and can get ridiculously fast-paced and frantic, so those who cannot really take too much stress are better off with other games (Sorry, but this really is getting frantic fast and keeps that pace going all the time).The shooter elements are incredible and have this ""Quake"" feeling, able to move and shoot in one fluid motion. The shooting seamlessly combines with moving, jumping and the enemies keep you going in many different ways (even though there are not a lot of different types). The item system is well-implemented and even though there are not too many of them they offer more than just an increase in stats, but also unique effects that are real game changers.tl;dr: A game that plays like a mix of Doom and Binding of Isaac with Voxel graphics, clever items, fast-paced and challenging gameplay and just a handful of bugs to boot. Also Zombie Nazies.			"

								Paranautical activity is a rogue like game in a FPS format. the developer (accurately) describes it as ""the binding of isaac meets doom"". the movement feels exactly as those old school tittles. the movement is very important on this game, strafing and jumping are very important elements of the game. The rogue like-nes gives it change constantly the way you play and develop strategies while you advance on the levels. It forcies you to thing about how you want to build your character through the game even before starting.Paranautical activity is aiming at all the right directions. It has a fast peaced gameplay and a handfull of items to keep it diverse. However, what keeps me from playing are all the unfair situations i encounter while playing. Being too slow and have a room full of homming proyectiles comming behind you or entering a room with only one hearth left and have a machinegun demon spawn on your back is horribly stressing, and makes me rage quit. But it has that refreshing thing to it's gameplay that makes you feel like a badass when you cleanup an entire room, and always keeps you wanting more.This game has major bugs and broken mechanics, but the developer hears the community. these problems will be fixed over time, but i would wait until full release. This will be a purchase you will not regret at any moment.			"

								Paranautical Activity is one of those games I picked up during a Steam sale on the grounds of ""it's three dollars, why the hell not?"" It's pretty much an FPS version of the Binding of Isaac, set in an undersea Nazi fortress (?) populated with demons, mutants, and affiliated scum. Each floor is composed of randomly selected preset rooms, which lock until the player kills all the enemies therein. As you move down the different floors, more hazards are introduced, such as lava and bladed pendulums. Bosses battles are randomized, divided between mandatory (the room with the elevator to the next level) and optional, and an easy way to get free items. The game is fun, in an arcade-y ""how far can i make it"" sense, though it's not without problems. The dim lighting and voxel-based graphics sometimes make it hard to pick out enemies from the background, and getting movement powerups makes it very easy to run into something dangerous in the often cramped rooms. The different weapons are often more trouble than they're worth-the shotgun and the sickle are your best choices, hands down, and even then, you're at the mercy of whatever powerups are randomly generated in boss rooms or the store in terms of damage or firing rate. That said, the soundtrack is extremely catchy, and it's hugely fun dashing through the levels when you luck out and get the right upgrades. Though I'm not sure I'd pay ten dollars for it, it IS a fun little game.			"

								In its current state, it needs much more work. This is an early release game so I'm sure it'll get better but, so far, the controls definitely need a bit more fine tuning. The action is not very exciting yet either. I feel that there needs to be greater feedback letting you know when you actually manage to hit an enemy. Another problem I ran into is the inability to bind any actions to my mouse. By default, Bomb is set to Mouse 2 but when I attempted to change the button to Jump, the game rejected the change. On a positive note, the visual style is fun and all of the colored lights takes me back to the days of Quake 2. The music is also very cool and fittingly frenetic to match the game. I love fast-paced shooter games and I'll be keeping an eye on this one as I wait for the bugs / polish to improve. For now, I cannot recommend purchasing this title.			"

								Its a game that is not easy and thats what i love about it. Its become probably my second favorite RNG Game after the BOI. The new patch made the game more fun with new enemies and weapons. Some people say that once you play it, its the same thing over and over again, but i disagree respectfully. Items, superweapons, powerups, and interesting boss and mini bosses keep the game changing. It may still be in Beta, but it fills like a complete indie games. I really like some of the ""Easter Eggs"" (I guess) with items like DOXY or credits with Bisnap being famous. It gives it a personal touch that makes me respect the develpers for showing what the like. RECOMMEND			"

Amazingly fun. the thing I hate about this game though is when you progress a certain amount it is made harder by enveloping the map in complete darkness... do not like, ples halp. still, heartily recommend this game, it is brilliant.Edit: I do however support the negative reviews in their complaints about the devs, they are horrible people and unless they start to support the game and support players, this will be another potential indie dev that has crashed and burned, of their own accord.

												This game is fine, but it isn't very polished. It feels like a budget game by one or two people, and it makes a lot of rookie mistakes in its design. Everything is very basic, but doesn't feel very stable. Enemy AI is very simple, always firing where you are instead of where you're going. Most fights just boil down to repetitive kiting. Nothing is explained or discoverable. There aren't any tutorials or controlled settings for you to learn how to play, you're just dropped in and expected to figure it out without any signposting. This wouldn't be a big issue in some games, but because of how hectic the fights are, you don't get a chance to absorb information or experiment. When you inevitably die to something that blended in to the chaos fired by an enemy that blended in to the background, the screen presents you with the option to ""restart"" or ""quit"". ""Restart"" sends you back to the main menu. ""Quit"" closes the game. I could go on for hours on the tiny mistakes the game makes all over the place, but overall the game isn't objectively bad. A lot of the problems could be fixed relatively easily. Regardless, I still can't recommend this game considering how many other games on steam are essentially the same game with a hell of a lot more polish.The soundtrack is nice, though.			"

								It's about as far as you can deviate from the typical roguelike formula and still be considered a roguelike, and still fun nonetheless. It plays a little bit like Quake, but less reliant on twitch-reflexes, and a little bit like Binding of Isaac, but with less depth.Still, a very fun game, and with a lot of potential as development continues.

												For all the negative reviews, I wish to state my appreciation for this game. I'm a huge fan of Binding of Isaac and similar games, and this one captured the frantic essence of that genre. A rogue like, class based dungeon shooter with crazy enemies and amazing weapons.As much as my computer struggled with it (for reasons unknown, my rig can play most things at max, but this at about half) I fought through it and had an amazing time. I recommend this game wholeheartedly and look forward to more from the devs!Check out my playthrough here:

It is very challenging and you feel great when you succeed because of it. But you are going to die a lot. The dev which caused all the drama that many reviews talk about is gone and an entirely new developer has taken over.I have not experianced any bugs like others have stated.

								Paranautical Activity is a fast paced FPS Roguelike. It has a difficult learning curve, and the game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ But kick your♥♥♥♥♥like your mistress would, you'd come back begging for more.I initially did not recommend the game, at least for it's price, but recent updates have really fleshed out the game. While still early access, the game is looking at lot more finished now.The most recent update added a plethora of new items, a new floor, new bosses, and most noteably achievements/unlocks.I would wholly recommend this game if an FPS Roguelike sounds like your cup of tea.

												I can see the logic behind the negative reviews. This game is not for everyone. It requires patience, reflexes and somewhat grinding for achievements - therefore the items. Now if you are not a fan of rogue-like, action genre, this game wouldn't be the best match for you. If you are, however and want to have some fun, this game suits your needs perfectly.I will start with saying that the game is really hard. This doesn't make the game frustrating though. After you get the grasp of the mechanics and familiar with the items, it will be only a matter of time to finish the game. David Bowie (RIP) is a playable character in this game (Though I don't think he would appreciate the choice of soundtrack.). Gameplay is fast-paced. That means there will be times you won't even understand how you died or took massive amount of damage. So never rely on your health being full. You always need to be alert and keep your reflexes up because the ways to die in this game are just too many.Like most of the rogue-like dungeon crawlers, RNG factor is significant. Game has six different characters with a huge item pool. There are many things that could make reaching the end a piece of cake. You can get the most OP items on the first floors, you can pray to RNG gods and get some ridiculous stats with the passive items,  you can find the boss room without too much wandering around the rooms and these thing also could make the runs really hard vica-versa.  Simple, pixelated, yet colorful graphics makes the game charming and kind of fits the style of the game itself, in my opinion. Music is... well, it is dubstep. Depends on your approach to electro music. Although I don't like dubstep myself, it fits the fast-paced theme and makes you randomly jump and shoot to everyone and everywhere, because the groove is real. Gameplay: 8/10Graphics 7/10Music: 7/10Replay value: 9/10Overall: 7.5/10, a good game for dungeon crawler or dubstep fans.			"

								Despite the friction between people of the community and people of the development team, this game is quite good.  Steps have been taken to make it what it was set out to be by the developers. The game on its own merits is very good: Gameplay isn't super unique but it is an enjoyable, fast-paced first-person shooter style rogue-lite.  While the item list at a glance is relatively small the variety of weapons makes it an interesting play.I wouldn't say it is infinately replayable as the number of item combinations and their affect on your gameplay isn't large, but the game is enjoyable for many hours and is well worth a buy.

												as an early access owner, and played the game recently, this game is a sad waste of potential. the game could have been this super cool fast fps rouge lite, but it didn't become that. it became an unreasonably hard and flawed game. to see why paranautical is bad, let's see why the binding of issac rebirth and all of it's dlc was amazing. standard diffculty progression, a good balance of bad, decent and amazing items, 3 end game bosses all of them fun to fight, and the combonations of certain items adds for extra spice, oh and also steam workshop for after birth +. paranautical on the other hand, has an unholy difficulty spike, some the items straight up hurt you and the best items are mediocore, the endgame boss is easy as hell (the normal bosses are harder) and there is no intresting combonations. simply, this game sucks. if you want to waste 10 dollars, waste your time and get a headache, then this is the game for you.

												If you’ve paid even the slightest attention to games in the past few years, you’re now very aware of what a roguelike is. Even games that have little to anything to do with the traditions of the genre have introduced randomness as a mechanic in order to take advantage of the buzz the term now generations. However, as ubiquitous as roguelikes have become in the last few years on PC, there have been few to try it in an FPS, and fewer still that succeed when they try. Paranautical Activity was actually one of the first as it went through Early Access, but controversy stemming from the game’s original developer delayed its full release to just recently, when a new publisher bought the rights to the title. It’s a good thing too, because Paranautical Activity feels like Doom made in a different age, and certainly deserves recognition for setting the standard of what a procedurally generated shooter should be.Want to know more?

Roguelike games are increasing in popularity and branching out to different gameplay genres like first person shooters.  The curious design choice to not provide a playable character with a normal weapon is mind boggling.Enemy AI is very limited and has trouble moving, especially vertically.  As with most games of this type there are lots of things to unlock and explore if enough time and patience is put into the game, but from the jump it's simply not rewarding enough to justify that.

A game would recommend. Paranutical Activity is a first-person rogue like-like, with an awesome overall feeling. Game takes place on a haunted ship, where everything is out to get you and you're out to get everything that is trying to get you. The characters are clearly destinct and have their own weapon. As the characters are so diffrent items you pick along your way effect the characters more or less depending on your choices. As many, I had my scepticism with an Early-access game, but if you can look past that, you can get into a game that's adding new content constantly.As a side note, the game hasn't been ""abandoned"" at all, that's a false rumor that's clearly not true, but still cracks me up every time, as it has become an inside joke that now is a pinnacle piece in the game's humor to me.

Other then that downside this game is great! Grab your prefered gun and pray to RNGesus, you might make it to the end.  It's fast pased old school strife jumping and alot of running backwards firing like a mad man!  There is a nice variety of rooms and monster types, the boss fights are interesting, and there are tons of buff and debuff items.

Early Access Review
								Firstly, I'd like to point out that this game is still getting more content added to it gradually. So this review is to reflect -current- gameplay and content.I have greatly enjoyed Paranautival Activity, and it has probably frustrated me about as much as Binding of Isaac has with regards to finding hard bosses, picking up bad items for my build, etc.If you like games similar to Binding of Isaac or Tower of Guns, this one is a great middle ground. The weapons all have their own advantages (Personally, the sickle is the best weapon in the game hands down) and each item is useful in its own right and can add interesting or frustrating abilities. For example, one item gives you the same jumping mechanic as VVVVVV has, that is, switching gravity and standing on the ceiling instead of jumping. It's cool, but can be a huge pain sometimes.The enemies are all interesting and difficult in their own right, and certain builds will find some enemies easier than others. I'd give the graphics, gameplay and amount of current content a good 8/10. I'm extremely excited about more stuff being released when the time comes, as I'm sure I'll come back to this game more.You should give it a try, seriously!			"

												I really don't like it. It's not a bad game, visually I found some appeal. It's just too hard from the start. There is zero to no explanation about what is going on in the game, zero info on the controls, and it just isn't very good overall.			"

								overall, the game pretty great if you love rougelike games like binging of Isaac. It can be pretty tough at times, so you should be good at FPS games in general. All in all a great game, but its pretty hard to get any further than floor 3			"

												It's a game.It's not as good as I thought it would be... but it's not bad.The game page says that it's inspired on Doom and Quake, but I have not really seen it (some character design maybe).I can't really recommend this game: only if you can get it on (good) offer or via♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(as I did), or if you really love games like Binding of Isaac w/ dubstep music.73/100, but I won't recommend it, since it has nothing to do with what developers say that are selling.

												I kind of don't get this game.From a technical point of view this is a quite fine game. This is a FPS game where every room and every level indeed is randomly generated. We have some patterns like a boss room or a shop room every level although everything else is mostly random.It's really hard to give a thumbs down to this game as it is technically a good game. This is just my personal opinion.Pros:- it's quick- four distinct character classes - different starting weapons, hit points value, speed and so on- randomness - after every boss fight we get a random item that changes our stats- nice graphics, looks like Minecraft on steroidsCons:- music is a dubstep mess - personally I don't like such kind of music although someone might find it amusing- this game is really hard. Maybe not Dark Souls level of hard but still hard- well character classes are distinct but only Tank starts with 9 hit points which relates to higher survival chance- I don't see a point in playing this game - this is only imoSo in conclusion - we have a technically decent game that lacks some kind of main motive. Or guts or spirit, whatever we may call it. If you like randomly generated shooters then go for it, it's ok, it's hard as nails, it's quick as Quake 1 and so on. I personally cannot recommend this game as it lacks something vital. I can't really describe this value in one words but let's say it this way - this game lacks a value that makes a player want to play this game. ---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												I wanted to love this game.  I wanted to so badly.Roguelike?  FPS?  Cool voxel graphics and that 'simplistic but awesome' lighting system reminiscent of games like Quake?  Multiple classes to choose from?  It's just too good to be true, it seems... and sadly, that's the case.It COULD have been good, could have easily been fixed and polished and balanced just a bit to create a fantastic experience, but in all the months and months I've had this game in its early access phase and even now after this 're-release', it's failed to address any of these issues.  In fact, all it seemingly HAS done is added a couple new enemies, achievements, and made shop prices even more impossibly high.  Great.The main issue is that it's simply too difficult.  No, NOT ""haha hardcore fun!"" difficult like your Dark Souls or Binding of Isaacs out there, but cheap, excruciatingly painful and unforgivably frustratingly difficult.  From the beginning of the game most rooms are PACKED with unreasonable amounts of every variety of monster and there is little strategy beyond  moving around wildly and hoping dearly that you don't lose too much health (which is generally far too difficult to come by, besides) as you struggle to fight back.If you're not lucky enough to be wildly powerful by the 3rd or 4th floors you're likely screwed, and by the 5th floor?  Forget about it.  I've never, ever been able to pass the 5th floor of this game in the tons of times I've attempted it, no matter how perfect my drops were, and this is coming from a guy who Platinum God'd the original Binding of Isaac and did all but the Lost achivements in the Rebirth version of that game.  I know FPS skills =/= overhead shooter skills, but I'd like to think my FPS ability is at least decent considering how many thousands of hours I've put into that genre over the last 15+ years and it proves I know how to weigh options, gauge danger, memorize enemy patterns and tackle various situations in action-roguelikes as a whole.. but no, I've never gotten past floor 5.  And I've only gotten TO it like three times ever, for that matter.The problem is, by the time you get there, so many enemies are... well, they are very fast, charge you, and deal damage so fast that there is NOTHING you can do about it.  No matter how fast you kill, they're coming from all angles, many types, and with traps on top of that.  And if they get to you, one of these melee enemies, from the sharks near the beginning of the game to the skulls and imps later to the chainsaw boss that you're almost certainly screwed if you ever fight?  The damage is so rapid that it's going to be all over, no matter HOW much health you have.  The game sorely needs a 1-2 second invulnerability period between taking damage, especially with how low the health values are, how much damage you'll invariably take simply exploring the dungeons, and how few and far between health restoratives are.  But no, once you're in the jaws of one of these melee enemies it's ALL gone nearly instantly, even if you're a tank with 15+ health and 10+ shield which should be an incredibly beefy amount -- it'll all be gone in about 5 seconds and you most likely won't be able to kill them in time to escape it even with tons of damage boosting passives.And did I mention they (aside from the sharks) are FAST?  Like, so fast that you won't be able to outrun them without loads of speed passives.  And did I mention that these passives only drop from bosses and shops, most the boss passives are jokes and you won't be able to afford 90% of the good shop passives by the time you get that deep even if you clear out every single room in every level up till then?  And that you'll DOUBTLESSLY have to buy some of the lesser passives as you just barely scrounge up the money to do so if you even want a vague hope of REACHING that floor to begin with?  Yeah.So there you have it.  An exercise in frustration in which you're going to be suffering through gauntlets of way too many enemies per room in such placements and combination that it's virtually impossible to avoid damage no matter how good you are, difficulty restoring the damage you took, and the knowledge that it's quickly going to become too overwhelming to even have any hope of moving forward no matter how good you are or how good the items you find are.  And no, it's not something you're going to learn and get better at despite the excrutiating difficulty like a GOOD action-roguelike; you're just going to suffer.  Period.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is great and all that, but it has a couple problems. -I don't know if anybody else has this problem but I do and it is to do with the performance. It's quite poor on my PC which is a large amount above the minimum requirements yet if I want at least 60 fps I need to turn the game down to either 720p or fastest. -Lack of multiplayer! Seriously! With all those classes you would think that there would be some form of multiplayer, yet there isn't. Huge wish for it to be there.Apart from that, the game plays great with the fast-paced shooting and the randomly generated levels make it just a bit more fun and give it a bit more replayability, however I don't see myself playing all that much up until the performance issue is sorted out or a multiplayer mode (One suggestion for that, have it so that you can play with random people, not just friends because I don't have any.) is made.

								I bout this game in a humble bundle, so I thought the was selling well or was nearly complete, its been nearly a year and I have reserved nothing in terms of updates.The game is hectic challenging and a true rouglike, it is a solid game which I have played for a while on my computer but isn't not very powerful so I put most of those hours on my friends computer, but I had a look on the forms a they said they were abandoning this game.This is a real same that the developers had to call it quits because this game had so much going for it ""binding of Isaac as a FPS"" which I thought was a brilliant idea and if had bothered to release multiplayer which everyone was look fawood too but I guess we will never see it.If the developers have run out of money and need a kick starter or more game sales then support it if you wish but they must go public and say that not hide away in a hole for months.

												I'm really trying to enjoy the gameplay here, the old-school straff, dodge and shoot kind of gameplay. It seems solid enough I guess. Though I must admit, I find it mostly boring. Not to the point of being tedious, but boring.But by Glob, I can't stand to look at this hideous art design from the menus to the ingame rendered graphics. And I can't stand this music either. I really tried to push through the visual and musical aspect of it all, but for once, it really ruined the game for me. It feels like this part of the game is totally overlooked as opposed to minimalistic or simple; and the little attemp you can find is way too ugly.			"

												Its a decent game which is an alright investment of ten bucks. Mostly a time waster though. Some of the weapon effects are cool though, for example, the item ""han's chainsaw"" which causes a large chainsaw blade to erupt from the floor when one of your bombs explode.A few complaints I have though are:-I wish it was a bit faster. It feels like I should be faster.-occasionally, youll get hit and it isnt really clear that its happened.-obvious disparity between items, leading to a point when you actively avoid certain items because grabbing them will completely screw the run.

												An FPS style binding of isaac esk game that i personally enjoy.About a year ago, i wouldn't have said that. The games community was a lot smaller. There werent many enemies, and everything just seemed... Unfinished in some way. But that my friends... Is not now. Now i would recommened this game to any/every one of my friends. The game has evolved to the point were it isnt just running around shooting everything that moves, it does involve some strategy. Example.. Going in to verse a mini boss isnt always the best thing, seeing how a lot of the time it can easily kill you, but at the same time, the item/gold you gain can really benefit you in the future.I could ramble about what i like about the game from here on, and what i dont like, but i'd rather just give you a list of pros and cons...Pros:- Good graphics- Nice soundtrack- Unique gameplay- Fast paced (which not everyone likes)- Tons of different enemies- Many bosses (All with unique attack patterns)- Tons of fun weapons- David bowie....Cons:- Cost.     Dont get me wrong, its not a bad price. But at the same time its not something i would aim for...- Enemy AI.      Sometimes... They're just so... Stupid...This game might not appeal to everyone, but if you have the money and generally like Rougue-likes and are also a fan of FPS i recommend this game to you.			"

												As an Isaac player I was extremely unimpressed.  In Isaac there are a large variety of viable builds and items that you can use to get through the game.  That is not the case here.  There's 1, maybe 2 different combinations of upgrades that you can get that'll allow you to win, if you're unlucky and don't get them, you'll probably die.The enemies are boring, the rooms are too large and confusing, there arent enough weapons or upgrades to keep gameplay interesting, and the game feel pretty clunky to play. Overall, had I not gotten this in a humble bundle, I'd be pretty upset with my purchase.			"

You don't get a lot of health either, so just taking a hit is never an option.			"

								If you like Binding of Isaac, you'll notice a watered down BoI feel when it comes to gameplay. It really suffers when you compare it to said game.. (Top down view will be missed, power ups feel very unneccisary, etc.) However, as its own game, it feels addicting, yet buggy. Controls sometimes fail when loading, classes feel very unbalanced at times, and the bosses either feel underwhelmingly eerie (rather than scary), or straight up punny (Note the nautical in the title.) Yet, when I got behind a class I liked (The Tank), I felt like a total badass Hershal. If you look past the flaws and accept that it IS a beta game, and ignore the blatant straight from BoI concepts... It's still addictingly fun.. It has issues, for sure.. but I'd still say give it a chance..			"

But, after legitimately giving the game a try, I've found myself really enjoying it. It's fast-paced, yet has some depth with different stats, items, and powerups. I find it very fun and it keeps me interested with procedurally generated levels.At this point in development, there really aren't many different items and powerups, but it is an early access game after all. After reading the update information in the community discussions, I was really encouraged.Overall, at this point in development, I'd give the game a 6.5/10, with certain potential to rise to a 9/10 by the official release.

												Ok, this is what i have to say after playing for about half an hour. The gamelay is fun. the pace is quite fast which i like and you certainly can play it with no tutorials or anything like that. But the Lag, the Lag just kill it. My computer might not be the fastest or the best there is but it is mostly average but the lag on certain place just kill the gameplay. As you can't do anything, and i mean anything the framerate drops to 1 fps if you are lucky, other times it just stops. And you DIE. but yeah, it a fun game. But i won't be playing anymore due to the sheer lag it makes when you start fighting a boss or in a more intense enemy place.			"

								FPS Roguelike. It is hard and it will punish you. But it is possible. It takes time to see what items suit your style, personally I love when I get really fast and have the sicle to throw around. Just throw it and run away to see the enemies bump into it. No need to watch behind you so that makes it easier to dodge some random mobs in front of you.Some friends have said that this is way too hard but I'm loving it and it's getting co-op soonish so it will get even better.

								Buy? Maybe. (Note, this reflects an Early Acess game that will likely change over time, potentially negating this review. Dec 23, 2013).PA is best described as a rogue-lite FPS, where the gameplay mechanics are boiled down to the near most simple understandings of the FPS model. The goal is to reach lower floors, but I'm not sure if there is an end due to my constant dying. Nagivating each floor is much similar to the Binding of Issac and NES Zelda - Enter a rectangular room and clear the are of enemies before you can advance. The game controls near exactly like the original Painkiller and early entries in the Quake and Unreal Series - fast movement, circle strafing, and bunny hopping. The hook of PA is using your skill to stay alive with your limited health and advancing with a mix of your class weaponry, passive power-ups, and active power-ups. Classes include Crossbow user, Sickle thrower, Grenade Launcher, a Minigun user and a shotgun user (I forget the names of these classes, except Tank for the shotgun user). Each have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of weapon mechanics, secondary weapons (if any), damage output, range, and health. You can also get other weapons from gift shop if you are able to save up enough cash from them, which is often tough (Weapons seem to cost more than I have ever earned early in game, and when I do save up good funds, I'm usually on level 3-4 where I die). Enemies are varied, some which shoot a single a bullet or two every two seconds, some shooting a continuous hail of bullets, or even those that can nearly teleport to you for melee or enemies that can hop towards you and explode on proximity. What most shooting enemies have in common is that their projectiles aren't hit scan, so it takes timing, skill, and room knowledge to be sucessful. Each floor has a miniboss that usually provides a power-up, money, and sometimes health, weaponry, or items.The art direction is much like 3D Dot Game Heroes with an interesting lighting selection - where there are very few lights but each projectile also emits projectiles. However, most players will simply say something like ""DARK MINECRAFT VOXELS WITH GUNS"". There is not much sound assets besides gun shots, door openings, item chimes, and the player's ""Oof!"" from being hit. Much of the sound is in the form of a nearly rave-like techno beats that reminds you of other ""Futurisitcky"" games like Wipeout, Extreme G, or Forsaken.I actaully personally enjoy the base mechanics and idea behind the game - it's actually very easy to get a grasp of circle bunny hopping and learning when is a good time to strafe or sometimes stand still. You can skip the majority or at least the remainder of the floor if you desire, provided that you are able to find the boss room quick enough. The game is both easy since I am decent at shooters and because circle strafing the whole room though the entirety of a fight is almost always sucessful, but hard due to limited health, and the unprediticable nature of roguelikes (random enemies, random power ups, random room types).My main problem with this game is once you reach level 3 or 4, you often encounter enemy flying skulls which are often hard to dodge, can gang up on you and ""combo air juggle"" you against a wall, and what makes it worse is that they can get so close to you that are behind the point where your bullet will spawn, leaving you literally defenseless (unless maybe you have a melee weapon). This is compounded when you have a group of skulls that for me, seem impossible to deal with unless I'm in a room with a floor plan that will block them or at least slow them down a bit. And of course, like Rogue-lites/like (and Adult Swim games apparently) it needs to be punishingly hard, so despite me doing well up to this point, I die and have to start all over again. Since I'd like to clear my massive Steam backlog, ""Ain't nobody got time fo' dat"". But unlike other rogue-lites where it seems like patience, skill refinement and a bit of luck will help you beat the game, I hit this brick wall to completion once I meet these skulls and my enjoyment of this game is wiped away, much like my progress once I see that annoying Restart or Quit screen.Paranautical Activity is very enjoyable, but a fairly shallow experience, which is multiplied by having to constantly restart. If you are into the resurgence of rouge-like style games as well as old schoold FPS games, there's a fun and simple game to be found here. But I fear the skulls will kill many player's enjoyment.

								This game is amazing in literally every way. This FPS Rougelike game reminds me so dearly of The Binding of Isaac. Although it is rather difficult to master the game, once you do, you can truly start to see the beauty in the game. Now, I'm sure you're looking through the other reviews thinking you shouldn't buy it. I'm going to take a few seconds to tell you why those reviews are just wrong. First off, one of the most common rumors is that the game is dead, that is a baseless rumor. The developers of this game are still working hard in attempt to patch the bugs and add new features. Next is that the developers are jerks. I ask of you to imagine their situation, working to fix bugs in a game and all the communtiy does is complain about the bugs you are trying to fix. Wouldn't that make you mad? Then there's the bug reports, some people complain about how they are ignored or treated rudely on the reports. These are the same people who don't bother to notice that the very same bug they're reporting has been reported multiple times. In short, buy this game because it's worth it, and ignore reviews from fools.			"

												It's back, and Now I shall review it. it's a rogue-lite fps with multiple characters that determine starting conditions, many items to att abilities or change gameplay, from the simple goodness of faster fire-rate to the absurdity of vvvvvvv style gravity flipping. That said, it suffers from the same things rogue-lites all suffer from, such as repetitive gameplay and fiendish difficulty, but then again, games like this are supposed to be taken in bites.every floor ends in a boss, and there are several unique bosses requiring different strategies, and then you move on to the next floor with an item belonging to that boss.All things considered, I recommend it for the price tag and fun gameplay, so long as the game's rather troubled past doesn't spoil things for you. I had fun playing it, and if you like rogue-lites, rogue-likes, and other such ilk, you'll find this easier to enjoy than many others in that category.			"

It's face paced shooting really gives it an edge, expecially with the limited ammount of lives every shot counts and you've got to time everything. The game has some really nice animations, but a few could use some work. The game is an early access game and doesnt have all its features. I honestly believe that if you enjoy face paced, first person shooters that bring you to the edge of your seat then I reccomend this. It's a classic FPS with great features that you can really enjoy.

								The game in it's current state, to put it lightly, is a mess. There is a great concept buried under piles of poor execution and broken promises. The developers also take out anger on the buyers by angrily typing about how our expectations are too high, and how they couldn't possibly finish in time for the deadlines they set for themselves. They also publicly stated that the game was being abandoned. Many promised features aren't going to be included, and they will be putting a 1.0 label on the game.The game itself is repetitive, glitchy, unbalanced and unpolished.

Of course maybe you like Michael Bay films and Micecraft graphics, Doom-1-but-far-worse-ish gameplay, random rooms with no point and a difficulty level that rubs the death screen in your face over and over. I've got good news! This game is for you! P.S. I only played as long as I did because I had to play >5 mins to review this garbage.			"

												Do you like twitch shooters? Do you like games where you die a lot? Are you cool with having only one main weapon(which can be switched with other weapons if you find them)? Are you crazy for voxel graphics? Are you willing to accept or even enjoy a game with elements of randomness in which bosses you will fight, and which unlocks you will get? Are you cool with games with no story whatsoever?Do you like games with levels and a boss at the end of each?Answer ""yes"" to most of these, and you should definitely check the game out.For me this isn't a game I sit with for hours on end, rather one of the games I quickly log into for twenty fast-paced minutes, just to get that arcade game feel. If you are the type who is obsessive about honing your physical execution ingame to perfection, there's a chance you will love this.Good game, and at a reasonable price.			"

Early Access Review
								I really want to like this game, I really do, but in it's current state and at it's current price, I can't. Paranautical is a rouge-like first person shooter, think Binding of Issac, mixed with Bioshock, which is a beautiful idea, and the 3D pixelated graphics give it a lot of charm, but that's about where charm ends, being a first person shooter, Paranautical Activity is very unforgiving, to put it in perspective I have beat The Binding of Issac multiple times, with multiple charcters, but with Paranautical Activity I'm lucky if I can make it passed the first floor. A lot of the trobule is you are constantly surrounded by enemies, which normally is'nt so bad, but like most FPS when you take damage there is usually a damage indicator, so you know which direction to turn and shoot, not with Paranautical Activity, so you figure that you'll use explosives to handle everything, well that's where another game breaking flaw shows it's ugly head, when you kill an enemy it burst into red pixels that skatter onto the floor and stay there for a few seconds, not bad right? Well every explosion also has a particle effect to the same degree, just orange pixels, so if you kill a group of enemies with an explosion you're in for a lot of particles, and unfourtately the game can't take all the pixels on screen, so it starts to lag real bad, and I know it's not my computer, because I can run games like Skyrim, and Dark Souls with no problems. So there is a lot of good in this game, it's got a great idea, all it needs to do is fix some bugs, but it seems like the developers don't want to fix anything, and until they do, or until they lower the price, I can't reccomend this game, however, if you can find the game for cheap, and you wanna kill a hour or two, pick it up.

												This is how not to do a roguelike. You can choose from 4 different guys, 2 of them worthless and unplayable, and 1 pretty bad. Then theres the game. Half the stuff you pick up on the ground you don't know what it is until you get it. Same for pickups from boss drops. Some items will tell you what it is called before you pick it up, but you have no idea what it does. Then theres the permanent items that you can't even read what they are, so you can't reference an item list from a guide. So you can be completely screwed. I was shotgun guy and picked up 1 slow down but more health, but i had no idea thats what it did. I was too slow and lost and had to immediately restart. I shouldn't be screwed bc of the game's fault for lack of info. Many items are just tradeofs, like temporary armor for perm speed reduction, which is just dumb and screws you, but once again don't know till its too late and you lose. There's no item list or info from the game about what items do, so you need outside lists. Enemies can spawn on top of you once you enter a room, leading to cheap damage. Some enemies also blend into floor and background, leading to cheap damage bc u can't see them, once again game's fault. Then there's worst of all. I was half way through game and first room I got had lava all over, and then these skulls that can auto catch up to you and you can't run from and home you and you get hurt. Able to kill them but took damage. Next level 8 skulls spawn, auto catch up to me, and I die in 5 seconds. It's so stupid I got auto loss when there's nothing I can do about it. Every room is almost the exact same with maybe some stairs. You fight the same 3 enemies each floor, and usually most of them on the floor above. Bosses are the only cool or original thing, but they usually just shoot colored balls at you anyways. You keep no progress. Can't start from higher floors. Keep no boosts nor money. You don't unlock new guys or any reason to keep playing. You get random unlocks from doing achievements but all that does is make it so an item has a chance of dropping now, which isn't much bc of the randomness. Very poorly designed how you can get into a room and bc of spawn there's nothing you can do  to keep from dying, and you auto die bc of the game, and lose all progress with nothing new to use next time or beefed up character to take going forward. Tons of better roguelikes, that are fair and well made that have incentive to continue playing. 3.5/10.			"

								Game is quite linear but really shines in many areas. It's face paced shooting really gives it an edge, expecially with the limited ammount of lives every shot counts and you've got to time everything. The game has some really nice animations, but a few could use some work. The game is an early access game and doesnt have all its features. I honestly believe that if you enjoy face paced, first person shooters that bring you to the edge of your seat then I reccomend this. It's a classic FPS with great features that you can really enjoy.

								If you like intense shooters and don't mind minecraft-style graphics, you will have fun with this game.  It wraps elements of Doom  and rogue-like together to make a dungeon crawler fps.  You basically run from room to room, strafing about to avoid projectiles from various enemies while trying to elimate them.  You collect loot from enemies and clear out rooms until you find the mini-bosses and bosses of each level.  Each room is optional to explore except for finding the boss room which holds the elevator for reaching the next floor.  Each level has a gift shop that randomly generates 3 items to purchase with gold received from enemies.  The only major downsides to this game is that health is hard to come by at times and you cannot save your game when you quit.  This game is still in beta so improvements are being added all the time, possibly saving will be added later.  One huge plus is that they intend to add Co op in the near future.  This game is fairly hard at times and gets frustrating when you die but it is very fun and addictive.			"

								Paranautical Activity is a great rougelike that focuses on fast-paced gameplay, as opposed to the calculating style of FTL. Were I to categorize it, I would say it is a combination of a dungeon crawler and a 3D take on Risk of Rain. The progressively harder difficulty keeps you from ever feeling you have beat the game, especially since every playthrough is different.The character selection is also excellent, with several very different characters. All in all, I find the game to be very fun. It is definitely one of my favorites so far.			"

								Good game to kill time, and also very addictive :P Its like fast paced FPS with combination of Quake and Binding of isaac. Game musics are great too, it's just that there is like 3 or 4 different looping songs, so those will eventually get boring to hear... Would be great if this game had option to add your own music to the playlist :) The way you can move your character, is just awesome. you dont get the feeling like in some fps games: ""damn, i could've dodged that but character is just too slow and clumsy to do anything -.-"". Personal favorite is that fastest class with thrown boomerang like sickle xD It's just OP against bosses, and another enemies when you just learn to use it right :D Aand yes, the game doesn't lack of fun either, with the good variety of items with, even ridiculous abilities makes your character better killer machine ;P So, the game is good as it is now and playable, but some bugs still exists... but it's what you should except from early access game :)			"

								If you like speed-run games, this is the game for you. The music playing in the background is very fastpaced, as it is techno,  making the gameplay very fastpaced. This game plays as a run-and-gun, where you go into separate rooms and they will start to branch off from there. The doors lock until you kill all of the enemies, so you cannot flee.There are normal rooms, boss rooms, and gift shops, where you use the gold you earned from the enemies you killed. There are also a few classes to be chosen from, but since this is an alpha, there are not many. For an alpha, this is a great game (in my opinion). Worth the money and will become addicting as you will want to play more and more.			"

								Okay this game, you need to have patience and be willing to get annoyed. The gameplay mechanics are great and it is very similiar to the Binding of Issac. Same as in the style of gameplay just without a storyline. Also its first person haha.For the price it is during the steam winter sale, pick it up, you will not regret the decision trust me!Maybe controller support could be an idea in the future projects.

								If you like speed-run games, this is the game for you. The music playing in the background is very fastpaced, as it is techno,  making the gameplay very fastpaced. This game plays as a run-and-gun, where you go into separate rooms and they will start to branch off from there. The doors lock until you kill all of the enemies, so you cannot flee.There are normal rooms, boss rooms, and gift shops, where you use the gold you earned from the enemies you killed. There are also a few classes to be chosen from, but since this is an alpha, there are not many. For an alpha, this is a great game (in my opinion). Worth the money and will become addicting as you will want to play more and more.			"

The best (and only) way to describe it would be saying its all the gameplay mechanic from Binding of Isaac, made into a Quake style twitch shooter. You still have the room to room exploration, boss battles, stupid power ups and permadeath which made Binding of Isaac so great, now played from a first person perspective with crazy guns and voxel graphics.If you liked Binding of Isaac or are interested in twitch shooters, definitely give it a go.

								Overall, this is an extremely well made game.  The graphics are very reminiscent of doom, especially the view bobbing.  Incredibly enjoyable game, infinite replayability due to the randomness.  The only thing I could suggest is to add more levels.  Right now, there are only about 5 possible rooms, and I have seen them all multiple times.  Perhaps even generating levels on the fly would be a nice solution, however this is a lot to ask for.  More classes might also be nice.Great game, my money was well spent.			"

Early Access Review
								At first, I was pretty skeptical about what this game might be. A game that claims to mix the gameplay of Doom and Quake with the roguelike aspects of games like The Binding of Isaac? There's gotta be some major patchwork to be done in this game. And it's true, there DOES need to be additional content to be added. Right now, at the time of writing this (January 2014), this game is very much still a barebones basic game (and I'm not talking graphically). The gameplay is very satisfying. The level design is random each and every time, so it's got one part of its description on the store page right. It IS like The Binding of Isaac in that way. The randomly generated levels and mix of enemies gives one a feeling of helplessness and unaware of what will come next. Bosses are fairly tough, and defeating one, depending on which character you play, is actually quite rewarding. For example, fighting a boss as Gilead is very different than fighting that same boss as The Tank. The character stats, however, are not very balanced. At least all the characters have similar stats, and there's no real pros and cons to choosing one over the other. Out of the ten times I played, I chose Gilead 7 times and The Tank 3 times. Now, while this doesn't exactly seem like a good sample size, you can just look up the character stats online. All of them are fairly even and not balanced at all. I suspect this will get fixed in future patches and updates, and I do hope it does, because if these are actually the final character stats, I can't see myself playing this game much longer. Back to the gameplay, the FPS integration is absolutely wonderful. A slightly minimalist HUD, simple weapons, great gunplay. These are the cores of any FPS game in my opinion if you want a good mix of immersion and good gameplay. There's nothing really much to say on the guns and the FPS aspects themselves other than I AM very much reminded of Quake and Doom in the level design, specifically with the wide open spaces you often encounter in the many rooms you'll be running and gunning through. Overall, I give Paranautical Activity a 7.5/10. For an Early Access game, it's actually pretty well done. The level design, gameplay, and integration of two vastly different genres are definitely what I found to be unique about the game. However, as with most Early Access games, be wary: developers can just stop updating at any time they please. Vote with your wallet and read reviews like this one first before you purchase!			"

								What happens when you combine The Binding of Isaac and Quake? Apprantly whales. Paranautical Activity is pretty much exactly a voxel-graphic first person shooter with roguelike room randomization and slight RPG elements in the form of items.This game plays almost exactly like The Binding of Isaac: You go through a series of rooms arranged Zelda-style and have to kill all enemies in the room before you can proceed. The enemies drop coins which add a dollar each to your total cash which you can use to buy items from the shop on each floor. There are 2 bosses per level, a sub boss and a main boss, each of which give you an item when killed. Beating the main boss allows you to goto the next level. Room locations, enemies, bosses, and items are randomly generated on each level.Despite this being nearly the same game, it still remains a very fun experience. Being controlled in a first person manner adds some depth to the control scheme, playing very much like old school shooters like Doom or Quake. The music is amazingly catchy, although the sound effects are a little terrible (they sound almost exactly like The Binding of Isaac too). You have a choice of 5 characters to choose from, all with a different weapon (shotgun, crossbow, machine gun, grenade launcher, boomerang hook?) , stats, and playstyles.This game is still in beta, so there isn't much content yet. There's enough for a complete game, but items tend to become very familiar, very quickly as there aren't many of them to find. The crosshair is a single dot in the middle of your screen which is almost too small at times and there's no option to change it, so hope you don't need one to aim. Mostly, the game just feels unfinished at this point, though still very playable. Get it now when it's cheap and give it a try.			"

								Time for a review with what I call ""The hierarchy of what matters in a game"" the first being the most important and bottom the least important~Story: The game doesn't seem to have any story, or perhaps it's less of a spoken story and more of a ""your guess is as good as mine"" story, but the feel of the game and the environment as you climb higher and higher is great.~Gameplay: Smooth controls, great aiming, sensical spread to the damage and the enemies remain difficult despite your improvement at the game, ensuring that every game is fun and interesting~Sound: The audio is simply amazing, the music is addictive on it's own even worth listening to on it's own! The guns have a nice sound to them making them feel quite real~Replayability: I can see stacking up voer a hundred hours in this game before I grow bored of it and that's if the game doesn't get more content through updates. With the updates I forsee 300+ hours.~Graphics: Greatly stylised old-school look, taking in the old pixelated guns and making it the style to make this game quite beautiful and always pleasing to look it. The dark theme keeps everything intense in feel and makes sure your eyes focus on what is moving.All in all: Despite my love for a great story and this game lacking an obvious one, I don't typically expect one out of shooters or most games I buy to lose a few minutes here and there. Adding that to the rest of the game simply being this addictive I can't say much more than it is a must try, the game is lots of fun and can even startle you at times and despite some of the enemies feeling a tiny bit cheap I associate that to my innability at aiming than the enemy itself being cheap.I do recommend!

I am not a really a big fan of shooters but I love roguelikes and this is a nice combo of the two.  Other reviewers are right, it is definitely a hybrid between Binding of Isaac and Doom! It is pretty difficult at first but once you get used to the fast paced it is very fun.  There is also a giant flying whale in it, need I say more? Recommendations:  Make sure your volume is up because the music is great and definitely adds to the fast paced experience,  Also if you are having trouble at first choose The Tank as your character since he moves the slowest and has the most life.

								Is there actually any other game where you fight a whale boss? If so, please recommend me one, because thus far no other game has pulled it off other than Paranautical Activity, that I know of.This game is spectacular, in my eyes. It's not just because of the shiney voxels, The Binding of Isaac-inspired randomly-generated rooms, the way I gasp in joy as I receive a pile of gold from a slain enemy, the wobbles and wabbles of the dubstep soundtrack, or the fact that there's a David Bowie class -- no, I'm being serious.Despite being denied the previlage to be put on Steam because of the whole adultswim business, Parantautical Activity proudly pulls off what you would call a Binding of Isaac FPS, if you just add lots of shiney lights, weird but freakishly cool creatures, dubstep and voxel-based graphics.Definitely try this game out, it's truly an experience, indeed.

I can't wait to see more of this game!One annoying bug was when I got out of the elevator to level 5 -galley, there were no doors anywhere yet the map showed 2 adjacent rooms. Not sure if it's because the content is not created yet or just a level generation bug. I'm leaning towards the latter since the trailer has the developer fighting monsters on that same level.			"

								Okay this game, you need to have patience and be willing to get annoyed. The gameplay mechanics are great and it is very similiar to the Binding of Issac. Same as in the style of gameplay just without a storyline. Also its first person haha.For the price it is during the steam winter sale, pick it up, you will not regret the decision trust me!Maybe controller support could be an idea in the future projects.

								If you like speed-run games, this is the game for you. The music playing in the background is very fastpaced, as it is techno,  making the gameplay very fastpaced. This game plays as a run-and-gun, where you go into separate rooms and they will start to branch off from there. The doors lock until you kill all of the enemies, so you cannot flee.There are normal rooms, boss rooms, and gift shops, where you use the gold you earned from the enemies you killed. There are also a few classes to be chosen from, but since this is an alpha, there are not many. For an alpha, this is a great game (in my opinion). Worth the money and will become addicting as you will want to play more and more.			"

								Only got this recently from the Humble Roguelike bundle, and its ♥♥♥♥in well good. The best (and only) way to describe it would be saying its all the gameplay mechanic from Binding of Isaac, made into a Quake style twitch shooter. You still have the room to room exploration, boss battles, stupid power ups and permadeath which made Binding of Isaac so great, now played from a first person perspective with crazy guns and voxel graphics.If you liked Binding of Isaac or are interested in twitch shooters, definitely give it a go.

												Fantastic game. I would say this is a seriously underrated gem that most people will unfortunately look over. I have spent hours in this game. It is a single player rogue-like fps and despite being a single player game, I have spent countless hours playing with a friend by taking turns and switching over after each completed floor. The only thing I would suggest is to add  a co-op option where you can hook up with a friend and take on floors and bosses together. But even without that, this game is a blast to play. I'm not a fan of the music myself so I just mute the music but leave the sound effects on and the game is still intriguing without music, although it would be easy to play whatever music you want over it. I highly recommend this game. It's an easy time waster when you have nothing else to due.			"

												I'm strongly conflicted on this game.It can be great fun a lot of the time, but you will find yourself dying for stupid reasons more often than not... not once did I die and think that it was my fault, but instead usually down to some stupid item I picked up not knowing what it did and completely killed my run. For example;The ""Eye of Dubbbz"" item. I got to stage 7 and picked this up. It made all of the rooms completely pitch-black (until the end of the game). I literally just quit. Why is that even in the game? That's a stupid idea for an item, especially when rooms become more cluttered with obstacles so you run into walls like the Kool-Aid man and die+ Skill-based gameplay which is fun+ Movement is spot-on + Music is AMAZING (Produced by MACAskill) + Weapons are fun for the most part and each have their different gimmick+ Punny names for weapons and items which is cool- Classes are basic and just have different health & armour, weapon, and speed.- Nazi levels seem out of place- Bad items that are there just to be bad and ruin your experience- Gameplay isn't addicting like other rougelikes- Exploding enemies can spawn in front of you as the enter the roomParanautical Activity is mostly a game about movement, and I love how a lot of the items such as the Recoil Rifle allow for some top tier gameplay, To make the classes more unique I think each class should start with a specific movement item (Such as dash, double jump, small etc)The aesthetic of this game is also confusing... it's like a nazi, pirate, demon shooter? What?TLDR: It's a fun game, but I recommend you get this game on the cheapest sale and give the rest of the money to MACAskill (the music producer), as they shafted him out of payment and basically took his music.

								Paranautical is a highly addictive game of chance,skill and on the run strategy.If I were to use another game to describe this one, I would say that Paranautical Activity is a 3D Binding of Isaac like FPS.This game provides you with a varied selection of starter characters (each with different stats and weapons) so it really caters to the individual's play style. During a runthrough the player can pick up so many items that they will become a personal class of their own, with no resemblance to what they started as.The player is provided three modes, two of which can be unlocked by completing the standard mode. Paranautical Activity becomes more difficult with each level you complete. Though items you pick up along the way will help you stay ontop of the next levels enemies.Each playthrough will be a different experience due to the complete random generation of this game. Differently sized levels, spawning different bosses, dropping different loot.If you are considering buying this game, the answer is yes.			"

												-OH WOW THIS REVIEW HAS HAD MORE ITERATIONS THAN FINAL FANTASY MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ IT IN ITS ENTIRETY-Developers are rude and insulting to their customers, and the game is slowly picking up bugs when it should be losing them. The game itself is really quite enjoyable for people who're into fast-paced arena-shooter type games, although it doesn't have the replay value of most action-roguelikes such as The Binding of Isaac. I'd give it a 7/10, although considering the attitude of the developers, the lying about features, and the increasing incompetence of the game's coding, I would regrettably have to advise against purchasing this.EDIT: As of October 2014 the dev team seem to be stepping up on taking community feedback and listening to the playerbase's concerns. I may change this review to recommend the game if this continues.EDIT the Second: I'd advise you to not buy this game as of late October 2014, as you literally cannot purchase it any longer. Thanks SpooderW.EDIT the Third: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand it's back, let's see where it goes from here.			"

												I might as well paste a comment I left on a friend's profile as a response to his rightful questioning of my sometimes hyperbolous♥♥♥♥♥ It reads quite a bit like a short review: I finally got around to playing PA and I honestly don't recommend it. Even ignoring the asshattery from the guys who did it, it was much less than what I was hoping for. Objectively it's not all that great. There's a huge lack of sound effects from enemies and part of the fun is that pleasing ""plonk"" that you get when you hit /or kill something in an FPS. It's objectively not all that great of a roguelike either as one of the best things about roguelikes are generally the items and what you can do with them. There is also a sizeable shortage of floors which is again something that roguelikes generally excel at.I kind of sensed this too. Which is why I was very nervous about the work or lack thereof in the future after they said it was ""finished"". It really isn't by any decent project standards. Is sad too because I love the aesthetic.Edit: Played a bit of the atonement edition. Still crap. But I appreciate what they're trying to do and will hopefully improve it rather than merely republish it.			"

												unbalanced, mismatched, and unfair game, i bought this because i love old school shooters and rouglike games so this game was an easy choice but when i started it up i died within 5 seconds. Okay... ill try again and realized that this game can be incredibly unfair espicially with the shark enemies that not only travel faster than all the characters, but the fact you literally have to stare straight down to shoot them kinda takes away the fun. This game does shooting and movement very well similar to quake 3 but its rooms are crammed with so much stuff  i cannot freeley move 3 feet without knowing EXACTLY how the room is set up. The weapons are also poorly matched with the stats on the characters, are not fun to use, and frankly useless with more interesting characters locked behind ridiculous challenges that only a die hard fan of a $10 arcade game ( probably not common ) can achieve, developer is also a jerk so yeah, don't buy this.

								Edit 2: I actually beat all the bosses a while ago on the first try, but stopped there because the game just didn't feel like much fun.What could be a great game is ruined by class imbalance, difficulty in aiming with certain guns as you dodge enemy bullets and lack of information on boss attack patterns.Heres a small example of why this game sucks:You are playing with a 3/3 HP class, boss has a lot of health, you haven't got upgrades or double jump because the game is just starting, you already used your few bombs on another boss. The boss spawns 5 spiders that quickly come at you while the boss keeps shooting fast travel speed bullets at you... and it keeps doing that until you are dead. So you have to move and aim around a small room with hill-like object placement, forcing you to stay rather close to the boss, but because the boss shoots with fast moving bullets, you can't dodge all of it because you also have to focus on evading and killing spiders, ESPECIALLY if you are using a single target, slow weaponhttp://paranautical-activity.wikia.com/wiki/SkullitoHere's another frustrating example:You complete stage 2 and pick up a powerup that decrease your speed but increases your damage.The next boss you meet hits you for 5 damage (5x1 quick hits because he's so fast) every time after he casts his special attack because you are too slow to run from him, even if you are running from one end to another, or around the walls.. it takes you 20 hits to kill him, but before you can do that, he's already killed you in 3 combo attacks. like, wtf seriouslyhttp://paranautical-activity.wikia.com/wiki/Hanz <---7/10, would not recommend at the moment.

Want Quake? Go to Quake Live's website, it's F2P, minus the P2W. They both do the emphasis on movement so much better. Also, if you call this a DOOM clone, you're being an idiot and I'd question if you've even played DOOM.The enemies are really dull, and are just hitscans. Yeah strafing is fun, but why not just play strafing in the game that does it best, Quake? i.e. why play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Quake-clone mechanics when I can just play Quake?Okay, what about items?Oh good luck finding those. Binding of Isaac was a lot nicer about giving fun items. The items are dull. You might as well be playing Quake with a few mods, as this is basically Quake + Binding of Isaac, but being♥♥♥♥♥♥at either.Mechanics are uninspired, dull, and level generation is really dull too, AI is horrid.tl;dr it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Quake clone, with less fun guns, ugly visuals, and dull levels.

Glad Steam brought it back it deserves it. I say it is worth the money it is priced at but I myself like sales so I waited for a great deal on it. Dont just listen to all the haters reviews because if they took a second to take the game for what it is instead of staying up Gabens♥♥♥♥♥ then maybe people would see it is a very enjoyable experience for the casual and hardcore fps player.

												Ignoring the fact that the devs were total imbeciles, this game still sucks.Rooms are lackluster, ""character"" weapons are quite bland.Explaination for things are practically nonexistant.There is also no difficulty scaling, the entire game just starts off rather hard, and that doesn't particularly make it fun.

												If this was the pre-death-threats-to-GabeN version of this game, I would tell you to buy it immmidately, but that is no longer the case. The game at some point had an update that added two things that ruined the game for me: Slipery movement, and cringe-worty in-game achievements. By slipery movement, I mean that when you let go of the movement key, you keep moving about a foot untill you stop. 1 Foot may not seem like much, but being that platforms and catwalks are only about 6-feet accross in this game, it ain't a pleasant feature. Couple that with one third of the framerate of Minecraft (I can run MC at 60, this game at 25, dropping down into single digits) and you have a very rage-inducing combo.Cringe-worth eh? Padded: Tampon picture, Heh Heh Heh: 69, ParaNUT, stupid pun, you get the idea. Now that I look at it, I'm nitpicking at the names, but answer me this: Why did the game need achievements in the first place? Is such a short (Per playthrough) game not interesting enough without them?IMO; Get one of these instead, they both are far better games: AND/OR "

								This game sparked a deep down paranoia in me about buying video games.The game being too laggy.Now im not talking about the game being a bit laggy and its a slight annoynce no, Im too scared of a game being so laggy its beyond being playable. Now, from all the gameplay footage I have seen the game it seems like a game I would love, which is even more crushing considering that I can't play it. The game is a 3-D bullet hell shooter where you are fighting paranormal and aquatic creatures with a number of different items, weapons, and charecters. The game (looks) is realitivly easy and if your doging is u to snuff you will have an easy time.The worst thing about this whole situation is that i payed money for a game I can't play, and as a person who hates to waste money this makes my very angry.Overall consenses, its alright... although I wouldnt know cause i can't run it. 3/10			"

												This game fails on pretty much every level.Firstly, the concept: It's basically a bullet-hell game in-first person, giving you an incredibly poor idea of where you are in relation to all the projectiles that are incoming from every angle and making it distressingly common that you sidestrafe into an obstacle, get stuck and eat a face full of projectile salvo.Secondly, the graphical/UI design: Pretty much everything that isn't a projectile is the same colour of shadowy gray-ish mess, meaning that about the only way to spot enemies is their glowing eyes(when they have them), which are obscured by the helpful volleys of glowing projectiles all over the damn place.Thirdly, it's a high-paced, dodging-heavy shooter... in a game where every single area is a cramped cube often further obstructed by stairs and similar. This one should speak for itself.And then there are just all the gameplay issues. For instance, on the third level I encounter a melee-attacking boss who moves so fast that even at constant sprint away from him, even bunny-hopping, he constantly catches up with me and hits me. There's literally no way to avoid damage, hitting him doesn't slow him down, Nothing does. Your only hope of beating him is that your damage output and soaking ability beats his, which is entirely down to what pickups you've been lucky enough to get.Did anyone ever playtest this? Or did they just slap a bunch of things together and go: ""FAST-PACED MUSIC. PIXEL ARTSTYLE. IT'S A WINNER.""?The music's pretty nice, though, so there is that.(Also why would you saddle one of the playable options with a melee weapon when every single enemy is either charging towards you to make its own melee attacks or constantly vomiting bullets? It's impossible to use it without taking damage.)			"

												 Game survived Gaben's ban hammer. 10/10 -IGNAll jokes aside though, there is variety in items, guns, enemies, unlockables, etc. But it all gets repetetive after a while. What I also didn't like is the fact that if you don't get a good gun/item 'till the 6th floor and have a bad superweapon, you're f*cked. I had a really tough time with gaanguses only because I had a crossbow and a cannon, and it ruined and lost the run for me. The only thing that kept me playing for 15+ hours was unlocking the  mystery man  and playing him, just so I can evade having a run where I'm like ""Oh, I'm the tank now, better get some speed and damage ups!"". The deluxe atonement edition is definitely better, but the game still needs some tweaks, updates, and with some luck, even new items/weapons. At this point you're gonna have approx. 30-40 hours at this game if you want to get all of the unlockables including the infinite mode. This game has very much potential, too bad the former developer team left it to rot.			"

								Fast, fun, smooth, and pretty, albeit too lean for its own good, Paranautical Activity is a fusion of old-school FPS and the ever-popular roguelike genre. Having a speedy, arcade-style shooter in a day and age where slow and steady is the way to go is always a welcome sight. The controls are confusing at first, given that the only way to learn them is through the launcher's configuration menu, but once you've got them down the game leaves you to your own designs. The rooms themselves are simple, having stairs, pits, tunnels, exploding barrels, and/or lava, but the types of enemies and number of them are just right to give the player a balance of control and chaos, while staying fresh each time around. There's also a lineup of high-octane Drum and Bass songs to run while you play, although they're knd of grating, and sometimes you get a few seconds of silence while the tracks are switching.While the combat in Paranautical Activity is great, the loadouts you get are rather disappointing. You choose package that includes a primary weapon with infinite ammo, a secondary weapon with limited ammo, and a number of stats including health, speed, and damage, although the concept of loadouts like this isn't exactly a nice one. There are no RPG elements either, aside from the various buffs and weapons you find in the game proper, so permadeath sets you back at square one. This isn't a big problem, but it really limits the replay value once you hit the difficulty curve.And from here inlies the biggest problem with Paranautical Activity: it feels very lean. Almost unfinished. There isn't much in the way of sound design, and despite the gorgeous visual style, particle system, and lighting, the game suffers from a lot of emptiness, even for a roguelike. After about an hour and a number of deaths, you feel like you've seen everything this game has to offer. Games like Binding of Issac have a plot and a sense of humor to keep you hooked. Games like Rogue Legacy have broad RPG elements and randomized perks to keep you hooked. This game doesn't really have anything. Even unlockable weapons would be welcome.Paranautical Activity is a good game with moments of real fun, and it scratches an itch that modern FPS games outright refuse to scratch. I want more out of this game, but it wears out on you about an hour in. If you and your wallet can justify an hour's worth of  gameplay that's fun and unique, then by all means pick up this game. It's an exercise in genre hybridization, but also in missed potential.			"

												Decent game needs alot more playtesting to be above decent the snail bosses roll is undodgeablei am all for difficulty but when difficulty exist for what feels like a generic reason like impossible to dodge attacks it takes away from the game to me so it's good when it works but some parts show a serious lack of competent playtesting but overall for the $1.99usd i got this game on sale for it's not horrible it just needs a little bit of fine tuning and difficulty settings would be nice as well difficulty i never did like random spiking difficultyI am not here to say buy or don't buy that is up to you what i will say is turning that FOV all the way up that might help with boss fights but as for me with the FOV at 90 the snails rolling attack was just impossible to dodge the devs could correct this with a sidestep feature or a dodge roll of sorts			"

								If The Binding of Isaac was a FPS it would be this game. Paranautical Activity is a procedurally generated, ""Rogue-like"", shooter. It's fast paced, similar to old Doom or Quake games, and has incredible replay-value, as probably expected from a roguelike. Especially the last patch, which added a progression system and 3 different play modes, added a ton of replayability. It's absolutely one of my favorite games ever.			"

												Steam description : ""Paranautical Activity combines the classic FPS action of games like Doom and Quake, with the randomness and difficulty of modern roguelikes like Binding of Isaac and Spelunky.""Now where is the Doom part and the Quake part because I didn't see any! The game plays more like a slow paced modern shooter than a fast paced old-school shooter. The shooting feels bland. The randomized rooms feel repetitive. Also, strafing and jumping feel kinda clunky. Just on par with other crappy so called ""old-school"" indie FPS such as Rogue Shooter and Wrack.Aside from that, there is at least one thing Paranautical Activity is good at : heating my graphic card like crazy...If you're in need of some modern FPS with an old-school feeling made by indie developpers give a chance to one of these games :-Hard Reset (2011)-Serious Sam BFE (2011)-Shadow Warrior (2013)-Eldritch (2013)-Tower of Guns (2014)-Ziggurat (2014)Gabe Newworld did a great job for getting rid of this atrocity from the Steam store. Too bad it came back to haunt the living as a ""Deluxe Edition"" because I am now experiencing ""paranormal activity"", not Paranautical Activity...Rating :2.0			"

								Got this pre-steam and enjoyed it a lot. Mainly bought it for the advertised co-op, but the dev decided to cancel that. And the recent update forced a ""Ghost"" on the player, where it spawns if you take too long, forcing the player to speed run rather than plan ahead. If the Ghost get's altered to where it's optional or get's moved to some sort of Speed-run/Hardcore mode, I'll remove that complaint, but the advertised co-op canceled is a big slap on the face,I personally wouldn't recommend it out of principle, but in the interest of fairness, this is a nice fast paced action game with permadeath, though the Ghost is annoying.Edit 1: In a post on the forum, the dev claims he will be putting out patch that will make the Ghost only appear after you beat the game once, THEN it's forced on you with no other option than to delete your save(and cloud), to start over. It's not like there's some sort of progression system, but it's an annoying hurdle. Dev said that new players hate it, but 'veterans' love it, which I think is big assumption  thinking that only vets love it and noobs hate it. Whatever, this post will be updated when he updates and I'll add on details on his choice.Oh, and by 'no progression system', I meant progression that carries over between games. There's plenty of power-ups that make you stronger or have more health, speed, etc.Edit 2: Firstly, I was wrong about the progression system. There's an 'unlocks' menu that shows a bunch of things you can do and it'll unlock various things like weapons, characters, powerups, items, new starting/findable items for specific characters, and game modes. I think it's a very nice system.For the Ghost part: There are 3 game modes. Classic has no Ghost and you can't reach the 8th floor. Hardcore mode has both the 8th floor and the Ghost. And Infinite mode, which is basically Hardcore mode, but when you complete the 8th floor, you loop back to the first. Not sure of all the details for Infinite mode, but thats the basic gist of it.Edit 3: Your 'thumbs down' arouse me, keep them coming.			"

												This game is by no means a terrible game and to be honest, the price isn't unreasonable either.  But the reason I can't recommend is simply because while the game's over all mechanics are fairly solid it just feels very...well, soulless. The rooms are random and yet despite this fact due to their basic architecture you'll still somehow feel like you've been through the same dungeon a thousand times over.  While the voxel graphics aren't terrible the enemies still come feeling like they were designed using the most bare minimum of artistic design. Essentially, after pouring in an hour you're going to feel like you've seen almost everything the game has to offer.			"

								Despite the great music and interesting visuals, this has not been a fun game for me to play.  It should be called Bunny-Hop Activity, because if you're going to survive you will be jumping around way more than is either fun or comfortable.  The concept of a bullet-hell FPS with perma-death, randomly-generated floors and item drops sounds great, but the execution here is really rough.  The bullet-hell is way too difficult to be fun for anyone less than a pro FPS player.Also, I they might think they're being cool by not telling you what the items do, and experimenting to see what is what would normally be okay with me, but it is totally unfeasible when you can almost NEVER get enough money to buy items, making experimenting really slow and unrewarding.  That, on top of the fact that most items have nearly un-observable passive effects that make figuring them our nigh-on impossible.  Couple that with the ""usable"" items and ""super weapons"" being unable to use until you go to Google to figure out which key does what, because you're given NO INSTRUCTION OF ANY KIND EVER.I understand learning by experimentation, and games not taking you by the hand, but it has to be fun and worthwhile, like a Binding of Isaac or Dark Souls.  This game is simply not fun enough, rewarding enough, or well enough explained or made to be worth it.We'll see what happens when it's finished, but unless you have twitch reflexes, and absolute precision I would avoid this game if I were you.

								Paranautical Activity is a very fast paced roguelike shooter. The combat feels like Quake on speed in much smaller, but well designed rooms (with enough room to bunny hop around while dodging enemy fire and shooting back).The enemies are nice and varied, and weapons are fun to use.In a nutshell, this is a mixture of the shooting mechanics of quake with the roguelike elements of Binding of Isaac.

												The game contains tons of references to nazism and satanism(and also bright flashing colors for epileptic people) and there is not a single warning or censor option ?Now i understand why one of the developers said things he wasn't supposed to say to Gabe Newell on his Twitter(and same for the controversy the game had).At the exception of that, Paranautical Activity is basically your average rogue-like FPS that just get the job done but lacks of general game feedback(that was really too hard to make the screen shake when the player take damage ? but no, it only shakes when it's too late and you can try again, also the weapons have literally no feeling and it simply destroy 80% of the fun you could get).

								This game is basically the FPS version of Binding of Isaac but it's also on steroids. It is so addictive taht you won't stop til you get to the 7th floor and beat the game. There are so many power ups that you wanna get just so you can see what they do. So many weapons, enemies, bosses, upgrades, and tons more. This game always has me on the edge of my seat no matter how many times I play it. And this is a warning to all of you who buy this game. As soon as you choose your character and click that select button and walk out of that elevator, you never know what you're gonna get from this game. Good Luck to you all.			"

								At the time of this review, while the game is still in early access, there's a laundry list of issues with lighting, movement, sound, and how the level generator makes and populates your killing grounds. It has a lot of potential that will probably never be fulfilled because the devs are extraordinarily dismissive of critique to the point of abandoning their reddit and steam forum and designating 'lucky' volunteers to send them 'select' posts.

								I saw a review of this game, and it looked cool. A FPS dungeon crawler with randomly generated floors and rooms. Sounds awesome! Then you changed the game. Picking classes at the beginning kills the suspense of not knowing what weapon you start off with. I died randomly at many occasions. Terrible default controls. Shift to change weapons? What?  And one class (Forgot the name) has a gun that fires spikeballs and a scythe that you can throw. Once one run out of ammo for the spikeball gun, using the scythe makes all the enemies (including the bosses) impossible because they move too fast. This is really sad because I can see a game like this being amazing but it just doesn't work. Of course the game is only in Early Access, so in the future the game might be better. But I can't recommend this game right now.			"

								Unfortunately in it's current state I cannot recommend this game. I liked doom and while this kinda mirrors that games concept it does not reach it's potential. It needs a overhaul in all departeemnets. I like the graphics, but they still need depth texturing and rendering in order for a decent amount of valid perception. The lighting however is great. The sound is what really disrupts it's plaaaaayability. The music is annoying and needs different tracks with ambience. Also needs gamepad aassimilation and a story campaign.Basiclly the game needs a complete restructuring with the same lighting and graphics style with enhanced texturing and shadows.			"

								Gameplay is just like Serious Sam: Walk into room. All enemies either run at you or start shooting slow projectiles. Kill them all. Repeat.One key difference is that the enemies are dead silent, rather dimly lit, and deal a lot of damage. When you walk into a new room, you can easily run backwards into a 12 foot high Satan and lose three hearts in an instant. You would think that this would make the game unplayable, but the number of different room layouts is so small that you will start remembering enemy spawn locations after a couple games.Since the game is rogue-like, it is really tempting to play round after round in order to see new items. However, few items really change how the game is played. You are going to be running backward holding down your left mouse button a lot.I only got as far as the floor where swastikas start appearing on walls and tiny fast moving raptors run at you (6th? 8th? I don't remember). That is when I realized I would have to memorize a whole new area of layouts, and that I had stopped having fun four hours ago. Could it appeal to some people? Maybe. Could it improve? Maybe. I would not recommend buying it now.			"

												DO NOT BUT THIS GAME.this is literally one of the worst games i've ever played in my life.the aesthetics are universally offensive. graphics are hideous, enemy and weapon designs are laughable, music is eardrum-bludgeoning garbage. the weapons themselves are horribly unfun to use, with no sense of weight to them and no sense that they are inflicting damage on anything you aim them with. every audio asset in this game is stolen. enemies don't even react when you shoot them, whether it be with a crossbow or a grenade launch. even wolf3d and doom gave you enough feedback that it felt like you were firing weapons that damaged the target, something that this title has completely failed to do. all of this might have been forgivable if the game was in any way enjoyable to play, but to top everything else off it also controls like steaming garbage. you move like a greased pig on ice skates and the limited field of view and terrible movement guarantees that you will get hung up on the slightest obstacle in your path.the real crime here isn't that this game was yanked from greenlight, it's that it was ever allowed on steam to begin with, and i sincerely regret that even a single cent of my money has gone into the developers' pockets.EDIT: since i have written this, this game has been taken off steam because Mike ""SpooderW"" Maulbeck threatened to murder Gabe Newell on Twitter. at this point this miserable software abortion was removed from steam and Maulbeck resigned from code avarice. except code avarice hired him again and sold this garbage heap to another publisher to get it back on Steam. do not pay for this game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.DOUBLE EDIT: I have been permabanned from this game's forums lmfao.TRIPLE EDIT: I have been unbanned. This game is still bad.			"

								This isn't a run and gun game. Its run, gun, and try not to die game. This was as if Dark Souls, Doom, and Binding of Isaac were thrown into a blender and this is the outcome. Its a really great shooter, it reminds of retro shooters where there is no regenerative health. The graphics are really cool, they have voxel like graphics which is really creative. It's also worth mentioning that when the enemies explode into items and red voxels which gives you the satistfaction of killing an enemy, and gets you pumped for more action (along with the door sounds opening when you clear a room). There is a HUGE variety of enemies and bossess as well, so won't get generic grunts all the time. The music is very awesome, it makes you pumped up and ready to kick some butt. The only problem is that there is barely any sound effects, the only sounds are doors opening, collecting items, and your weapon noises.Overall this game is really great and I highly recomend it.

								I have this game on Steam, and I really enjoy it. Here's a breakdown of the short while I've been playing it.PROS- Fast-paced do-or-die action gameplay- Variety of weapons and classes (recently updated and balanced, every class now also has a secondary weapon)- Variety of enemies (recently updated with a rocket turtle :D)- Recently updated ""free weapon"" door (you'll see when you play)CONS- You can get stuck under stairs (a pain, given you only have a few hits and no recovery time between hits)- Some boss doors have pentagrams (a moral preference)- Some bosses seem unbeatable based on your class (some you need to outrun, like the Snail Skull, but the Tank class is too slow)NEUTRAL (Pro or Con based on preference)- Unoriginal cubed ""Minecraft"" look- Can't change the music (I happen to like some songs. I've heard by others that they are obnoxious)TIPS- Don't stop moving- Try out all the classes for their weapons to see if you like them before you buy replacements in the gift shop- Don't underestimate those little dudes... they are surpisingly accurate.

								From a mechanics standpoint, I cannot recommend this game. It's like they took a good control scheme and deliberatly made it worse. Your character controls awful, and while normally the retro atmosphere would be enough to do it for me this game feels... clunky, I guess?The boss fights are terrific, but the lack of variety is the real killer for me. I guess the plan was to try and let the randomly generated content make for lots of replayability, but the game is to short to get any unique experiences. The roguelike mechanic just ends up feeling like a padding technique in the end. Nice idea, but poorly executed.Then there's the elephant in the room - The Public Relations.These guys are terrible at PR. There have been allegations of censorship, insilts made to the gaming comunity, and several instances of trolls provoking negative responses. It's my personal belief that this is the reason this game was ""finished"" early - It's not a case of the goals of the developer being met, it's that they just want it to be done with.I would suggest picking up the games it was inspired from - you'll get a lot more gameplay, for substantially less cost.

I know it's meant to be hard, but the difficulty curve starts 100 miles in the air.  Also, the devs say they've abandoned co-op mode, which is disgraceful.			"

								This game is quite unique. It has a terrific soundtrack, retro/modern graphics combinedwith the rpg elements of choosing a character. The difficulty increases each time you move up a lvel in the elevator, which is good. Some of the enemies look like something out of doom, but then you have these random Jawas shooting fireballs at you and exploding dinosaurs. The bosses are even better, some so strange that you'll wonder where the inspiration for them came from. Another ineresting element to the game is the money system, in which you collect coins to buy various upgrades that can alter your speed, health and jumping abaility among other things. This game is great as it stands, but if you get it, somewhere along the lin co-op will be introduced, might be a long shot, but would only make it more fun.			"

								This is a pretty fun game. Full of challenge, explosions, and pain. If you're good at twitch style FPS games you'll start out without much of a challenge at first but once you go up a few floors it really kicks it into high gear with the difficulty. It doesn't have a lot of bugs but it seems to lack some content. Too similar tiles, too few bosses, and a lack of enemy variety at first. If you like difficulty, the voxel style, and FPS arena shooters I'd recommend this game to you.			"

								Super quick and super addicting FPS Roguelike that sadly lacks a save feature, but doesn't really matter cause the diffuculty will have you dying often. I hope I can find new classes, but so far the game is really fun. If you like FPS' and Roguelikes, its a must have.			"

								If you throw Binding Of Isaac, Quake and Minecraft into a blender, you would get Paranautical Acitivty.Even in and early state, this game is a lot of fun but clearly lacking features.You start the game choosing presets of weapons, so far I prefer the shotgun although you dont get a secondary weapon and it is slow, so it has its cons.It uses a similar random room system as Binding Of Isaac which helps keep the game from feeling non linear, In its current state you will be facing the same type of enemy a lot.So far I have seen maybe 4 or 5 types of enemies excluding boss battles.It controls like a twitch shooter like the early days of quake, and gaining powerups to double jump etc. adds a lot of fun jumping and dodging bullets around the rooms.The minecraft esque graphics look beautiful with a great lighting system. When you destroy enemies and explosive barrel's you will see a lot of 'particle' like effects which look great.In its current state I would give this game a 6/10, I have not read about the upcoming features but this could easily be a 7 or 8/10 game when it is completed.

								Paranautical Activity is an excellent roguelike dungeon-crawling shooter, with simple humbling textures, and a charming implementation of voxels. This game's satisfaction, consisting of fighting off hordes of demonspawn, and cracking open phat lewts is only matched by that of the speed and finesse the player as they weave and blast their way through randomly generated rooms. All set to a spicy hardcore techno beat, valliantly played through the entire game.In addition to promised future updates, Paranautical Activity is absolutely worth the purchase to support its development. I personally await anxiously to play this game again in the future when I have a computer with enough hardware capacity to play this game without strong lag.      8/10			"

Even tough is a voxel game, the enemies are always different and lights and lava and shots everywhere. It's still on beta, so be aware that everything is not 100% done and is subject to change.Some weapons are not that good, but If you find one you like, you can have fun.I would reccomend picking it up because it's fun in it's current state AND it's on beta, so it's cheaper and you can have your own opinion until the full game comes out.

								OK... this game is awesomeI really like this game. The gameplay and controls are simple, its not like other games where the game forces a tutorial at you so you can learn the game. The fun thing is to learn about the game as you play.The game is also challanging at some points, but that is a good thing for a game like this.The art style is cool with the glowing lights and the blockshaped world.I like the weapons, I wish they would make more.If you like the binding of Isaac then you are gonna live this game, there are very much alikeThe soundtrack is also AWESOME!!The issues that I have with  with this game is that it can be a bit slow at some points, because sometimes you have to go through many rooms that you have already cleared to buy items and get all the way back to the next floorAlso this is just a personal issue... my computer does not go well with this engine, but I found a way to solve itI recommend this game to people who likes fun and challanging games. This game is addictive and has a lot of replayabillity.			"

								Although I have not gotten very far in the game (level 3), it is quite easy for me to say that it is a lot of fun.Here are a few positive things I'd like to point out:-Game mechanics are incredibly simple and easy to grasp-Impressive enemy variety-Weapons are fun and varied-Power ups and stores offer many options for players-Dungeon designs are varied-Success is reliant on player skill-Lighting effects are cool-Art style is cool-Music is cool, and fits the action-HUD is unobtrusive and informative-Boss, and mini-boss, battles are fun and creative-Game is cool (haha)Here are a couple negative things:-No scoring system or scoreboards-Only a few music tracks-No achievements (not a neccesity, but it might be cool)Overall I've had a lot of fun with the game so far, its easy to jump in and play for a bit. I am also quite excited for the co-op update. "

								What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said. When I first saw this I rolled my eyes and said great blocky graphics.... again! Now let me say that i am not a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥. I enjoy 2d games over all and I am nuts for roguelikes. So I saw this game on the Humble Rogulike Bundle and said, ""Hey, why not?""This game is absolutly amazing. It combines the fast paced FPS of classic Doom with the randomized dungeon crawling of Roguelikes flawlessly and the visual style is mind blowing! It is unforgiving and should not be played by someone expecting deep story and lore. This is simply going room to room killing... monsters of some sort for loot and coins. I don't think i've gotten past four rooms before getting slayed. In Paranauutical, it's never been so fun to die.			"

								Very fun intersting game, which you mostly depend on mobility to survive and dodge attacks. With 5 interesting and balanced classes you are sure to find at least one that you like. The game offers a challage, and can be compared as an easier version of binding of isaac, once you get the hang of the controls. It has interesting and eye catching rooms and models, If you decide to buy it, it will offer a nice looking, entertaining, 3D block, indie, action packed game that will provide hours of gameplay. So I highly recommand you buy this game it is worth the money, 10/10			"

								Very fun intersting game, which you mostly depend on mobility to survive and dodge attacks. With 5 interesting and balanced classes you are sure to find at least one that you like. The game offers a challage, and can be compared as an easier version of binding of isaac, once you get the hang of the controls. It has interesting and eye catching rooms and models, If you decide to buy it, it will offer a nice looking, entertaining, 3D block, indie, action packed game that will provide hours of gameplay. So I highly recommand you buy this game it is worth the money, 10/10			"

								Not what you'd expect from a game called ""Paranautical Activity"". At first glance, you hear and see it as a horror shooter game, but when you see someone play it, or play it for yourself, you realize it is everything but that. Paranautical Activity (you have no idea how hard that is to type) is a blocky, retro type fps shooter. This particular game is not meant to be played for hours at a time, in my opinion. Because you can die so quickly and easily, I havent played it for more than 15 minutes at a time. Of course, Paranautical Activity has a lot of work that must be done to stand up to games such as Doom, Shadow Warrior, etc. I do personally think this game can stand up to and potentially overthrow the games mentioned before in Retro shooters.Now, about the game.This game has every element of a good shooter, but these elements need to be executed better. Don't get me wrong, I love this game. I play it whenever I'm bored, and it is a very good time waster (I say that in the best way possible). You are dropped down into a series of rooms by a red elevator. If you enter a room, the doors will shut and you can't leave until you kill all the enemies. Every once in a while, you'll come across a boss room. The boss's health will be displayed on the top of the screen and when you kill it, the doors open again as if you're in a normal room. Occasionally, you will stumble upon a shop. These shops are randomized with useful/useless items that you can pick up and use in battle rooms. If you buy an item, it disappears from the pedastle.Overall, I like the game. It's in early access, so the kinks and bugs I meantioned earlier will most likely be fixed. It's on sale a lot, and it's even worth the $10 it's usually priced at.9/10, buy it.			"

								Alright, now that is the best dungeon crawler/rougelike/generated-levels-arcade since The Binding of Isaac. A hybrid of that one and the classic shooters, it gives you a unique experience. It may be an alpha, but it is so playable I would call it the Steam's best Early Access 2013. It definetily is worth its money and I suggest you buying it for you and your friends right now.The only downside is that the game's interface doesn't fit the 5:4 screen, but it can also be fixed by changing the resolution to any of 16:9 formats.

												Pros:- Decent music- Decent enemy variety- Items and other stuff to find through out the dungeons- OK boss fightsCons:- All of the weapons suck, usually difficult to aim or use, lack impact and are never multi-purpose. Trying to use any of the 4 main weapons to fight most of the enemies is a real challenge. - Classes are pretty useless. They all seem to be extremes with only 1 balanced class. Other classes include, guy with 1 hp, guy who moves slower than a rock, guy with ultra useless weapon.- Extremely repetitive locations. Every room is the same as the last and it's the same shade of blue most of the game. - Floaty controls, the movement just feels wrong. View bobbing is annoying too.- Colliding with oddly placed staircases and other pointless structures.Overall:I don't recommend this game. Each play session is so damn short it's ridiculous. No matter how many times i try and with any of the classes, I rarely make it to the 3rd floor. Often getting hit by things I can't even see or are unable to dodge with the slower classes. It lacks content, isn't very fun and gets very repetitive very quickly. Unless you like shooting the same enemies in the same rooms with the same 4 textures using awful weapons, stay away from this game. There are many better shooters out there. The roguelike elements aren't used in any interesting way here either. Just another excuse to stretch out a game's length when it otherwise lacks content and substance.			"

												I really want to reccommend this game, but the bad just ended up outweighing the good. Is it a fun game? I'd say so. It's fast paced, action-packed and the graphics are surprisingly unique. However, there's just too much I personally don't enjoy for me to keep playing. I'm all for hard games, but in some parts, the difficulty spikes in unfair ways. I'm not even talking about the bosses, which, while cliche (flying skulls? really?), are fun and pleasantly challenging. I'm referring to enemies like the land sharks that are nearly impossible to hit and can grind your health away in seconds after noiselessly charging you in packs of 5 or 6. Another issue I had was the item system. Some items, when activated, seem to do absolutely nothing. I'm sure they were performing some function, but some feedback or even a short bio displayed when picking up the item would have been appreciated. Also why does the sword use ammo? That's nitpicking, I'll admit, but something just seems odd about that to me, especially since it appears to be just a standard medieval sword. While fun, Paranautical Activity doesn't really enough to keep me playing for more than half an hour or so.Score: 5/10 "

												So I'm on a mac, and I buy this game, and I open the game, play 5 minutes and then I get an achievement and the game dies. I open it up again and it goes to the loading screen and freezes, I've tried many thing to fix this. So I don't know other peoples experiences with this game but in my opinion, if it freezes and can't open from me getting an achievement this game sucks. Thanks Paranautical Activity.EDIT: Although what I said here is true, I'd like you to ignore it. I was able to fix the problem with not opening. It still for some reason on macs it seems, freezes whenever you get an unlock in game or a steam achievement. I'm not sure how to fix it. I find that the game that you can actually play itself is really fun and interesting and amazing. But I keep crashing so until I either 100% it's gonna keep doing this.

												Oh boy this game. Originally taken down due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥  devs, and reuploaded for god knows what reason. I purchased this game when there was a rouge-like sale going on, and even though it was only about $2.50, I regret it. Now, before I go one, I have to preface this by saying that I played the Tank 99% of the time. I greatly enjoy heavy characters, and From the stats I thought I would enjoy playing as him the most. I did, as the others were♥♥♥♥♥♥ However, whenever the Tank fires his shotgun, theres a full second of the game registering the damage or if it hit or whatever, where the game entirely freezes up. This mostly happens on larger enemies, but it makes the game utterly unplayable due to it. You stop, and the game doesnt. Id be fine with this if it was purposefully implemented, but its clearly not as when you attack smaller enemies or hit with fewer pellets, the game doesnt freeze. The cannon on the other hand is completely worthless even without a glitch, not that it doesnt have one. When firing the cannon, sometimes there will be a visible projectile but sometimes there wont be a charge up time OR a projectile, just immediately dealing damage to whatevers in front of you. It makes the gun entirely unpredictable, which is not a good thing in a game about avoiding death. Bomb's usefulness varies from very good against slower enemies, to absolutely worthless on bosses and slightly faster enemies. A major MAJOR problem in the game, however, is the fact that not every class can beat every boss. While playing as the slow Tank, I encountered a snail-like boss that immediately curled up and unrelentingly rolled at me, much faster than I could move out of its path while it immediately snaps to wherever I run, making the entire fight a DPS race which is NOT A GOOD THING. It might be that I just didnt figure out some secret strategy of beating it, but that's a moot point. There is no point in making a game unplayable just for the sake of difficulty. There's some good things about the game, for as much as Im harshing on it: The concept of an FPS Roguelike is a very fun one that has tons of potential, of which they use none. The graphics are very adorable, giving even what are supposed to be hideous monsters a very huggable and blocky appearance. It is an overused artstyle, but I have a weakness for it and enjoy when it is used.Also the music is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.			"

												This is a game with a lot of struggles. It was originally denied access to Greenlight, then it was allowed and greenlit and released, then it was pulled from Steam and then it was put back on Steam. I originally got the game at launch. But let's put that aside and talk about what the game IS and not its troubled release history.Paranautical Activity is a first person roguelike. From a gameplay perspective it borrows a lot from The Binding of Isaac, notably the room grid approach where the player needs to defeat all enemies in a room to progress instead of moving freely in a continuous level like in other roguelikes. And like Binding of Isaac, each floor has a boss at the end as well as optional minibosses. The first first person perspective alone and the three-dimensional design of rooms makes the game very action oriented and keeps you on your toes. There are also multiple ""characters"" to choose from, each with radically different weapons, so there is variety in gameplay. The presentation of the game is pretty neat, making use of voxels to render everything. And I can honestly say I had a lot of fun playing this game. If you want a very action oriented roguelike with FPS control, then I say give this game a try.			"

Early Access Review
								About 10 minutes of gameplay tells you that there isn't much to this game. It's trying too hard to be The Binding Of Issac from the Quake mindset but lacks of the soul of both of those games. I should state that I have sunk about an hour into a DRM free copy and I have done a few levels but there really isn't anything to this game it states ""Early Access"" but it really feels like the devs aren't adding anymore to this game and it may as well be out at this point. Maybe I just enjoy real ""rogue-likes"", where some thought had gone into this game. This feels like an poor XBox Indie Game and nothing more.			"

								Well, to be honest I am a bit divided about this game.  I really wanted to reccommend it to everyone, it looked and functioned for the most part how I expected it would.  A simple, pixelated shooter with Rogue like elements.  That being said..the developers promised multiplayer multiple times.  I bought into this game rather late into it's development.  However it was promised on Steam, and judging by various Forum posts it was promised elsewhere as well.  However, it is not just the Multiplayer that detracts from this game for me.  It's just not that fun..well, at all after awhile.  The challenge overides the novelty of it all and even though a rogue-like seems fun..it doesn't quite add up.  Progressing a level or two, getting killed and then reset all the way back to the beginning can be a bit annoying.  Not just that though, I mean there is no story to the game which for the most part is barebones as it is.  The developers have also been agressive towards player criticism in the past..never a good sign when you can't take criticism.  2 out of 5.			"

								I have been playing the game for a short time now but I can already say that the game can be addicting. Although there is no save option and it is very difficult it is still very fun. The game is pretty good for an early-access game, but it could still use some work. I would like to see some kind of save mode and more starting options. Other than that the game is pretty decent and worth it. I look forward to when it is fully released.			"

								This is a very fun, but very unfinished game. Just know that going in. The game is difficult, close to Quake's ""nightmare"" setting, and—true to the roguelike ethos—rarely gives you a fair fight. Bad runs are still fun, and good runs are exhilarating. On downside, the multiplayer coop has been cancelled (which sucks but it's not for the developers' lack of trying). Two more patches are planned before it's complete; but your money gets you solid, hard-as-diamonds old school FPS gameplay. And that ain't bad.			"

												A hybrid of games such as Doom and The Binding of Isaac, Paranautical Activity delivers exactly what you expect from a mixture of the two. While not as good as games like isaac or gungeon it's pretty fun and challenging for what it offers, I would definitely recommend you at least try it out although maybe not at full price but it's not that expensive to begin with so it's up to you on that. it's got a pretty nice soundtrack and the items all generally feel pretty good.

												A bumping soundtrack and fast paced, hard hitting weapons with cool particle effects, a selection of weird bosses and a handful of surreal supernatural atmosphere all come together and make Paranautical Activity a make a great fast paced FPS Dungeon Crawler with roguelike elements that I still have fun blasting out a quick game or two in here and there.Paranautical Activity began to pick up traction within the Steam community, but then went off the rails after one of the two developers went on a childish twitter rampage against Steam and had the game pulled after a comment about killing Gabe Newell[ http]/Much like Fez, despite all the nonsense and bad publicity because of a developer, Paranautical Activity is still a pretty unique, adrenalin pumping fast blast of a game.Highlights* Excellent timing/pace and very quick off the mark* Unique enemies and design* One helluva SoundtrackMistakes* There's a sentiment from Steam gamers to avoid this title because of the twitter comments and attitude of the former developer. While I personally think the former developer was a childish idiot, I separate my choice to purchase a product from any attitude or conceptions I have on people involved with the creation of a product. For some people the attitudes of people working for a company go hand in hand with their choice to purchase products from that company, and may take issue. However the the developers are no longer involved and the title has now near-completely changed hands.* There are noticably too few enemies, and arguably a lack of weapons, which means gameplay becomes repetitive after long stretches.RecommendationsAvailable on Steam for £6.99/8.99€/$9.99 at the time of review, which feels very fair. It's very replayable and I often find myself coming back to run through a quick few floors. It's often available cheaper via various Indie Bundles, so search around.			"

												Disregarding the controversy with the original dev: Is this a good game?Yes, one of the first to explore the Roguelite FPS this game still stands up to other games in this sub genre. I had to fiddle with the FOV till I found something comfortable but once that was sorted out I was having a blast.. Sucking terribly but still. Pretty fun. For me the real selling point is the soundtrack, nothing beats rocking out and blasting something to bits.Definitely worth picking up on sale.

												A great rouge-like game. Mixes ideas from Binding of Isaac with first person shooters that has a Quake/Doom feel to it. The replayability isnt too great at the moment (This review is being written while it is in early access.) Also The devs have mentioned they are working on multiplayer co-op and are also going to be adding a ton of new content. I have yet to beat this game but it sure does provide a challenge in the later levels. (Things crawling on the walls, projectiles everywhere, etc.) I would say this game is worth buying. It's really fun and quite a challenge and i'm sure once the Multiplayer co-op with all the new content is released it will be even better. I'd give it a 8/10 because there are some minor flaws such as it needs more content (Items to be exact, maybe more weapons aswell. Not to mention maybe some more room layouts.) but other than that it's a great game and I highly reccommend giving it a go.After Early Access edit: Well, the old developers went completely haywire and did some stupid stuff, but now there's a completely new owner and hopefully they take the game in the right direction. My old review still stands as it is still pretty fun to play.2nd edit: The new devs have done absolutley nothing. This game is just a mess.			"

												This is a game with a lot of struggles. It was originally denied access to Greenlight, then it was allowed and greenlit and released, then it was pulled from Steam and then it was put back on Steam. I originally got the game at launch. But let's put that aside and talk about what the game IS and not its troubled release history.Paranautical Activity is a first person roguelike. From a gameplay perspective it borrows a lot from The Binding of Isaac, notably the room grid approach where the player needs to defeat all enemies in a room to progress instead of moving freely in a continuous level like in other roguelikes. And like Binding of Isaac, each floor has a boss at the end as well as optional minibosses. The first first person perspective alone and the three-dimensional design of rooms makes the game very action oriented and keeps you on your toes. There are also multiple ""characters"" to choose from, each with radically different weapons, so there is variety in gameplay. The presentation of the game is pretty neat, making use of voxels to render everything. And I can honestly say I had a lot of fun playing this game. If you want a very action oriented roguelike with FPS control, then I say give this game a try.			"

The game offers a challage, and can be compared as an easier version of binding of isaac, once you get the hang of the controls. It has interesting and eye catching rooms and models, If you decide to buy it, it will offer a nice looking, entertaining, 3D block, indie, action packed game that will provide hours of gameplay. So I highly recommand you buy this game it is worth the money, 10/10			"

While others dislike this game because of the lack of updates and the poor feature discontinuation of the devlopers, I personally enjoy this game, although I am very very disapointed at their discontinuation of the multiplayer (Thats why you don't announce a feature until AFTER you confirm in your ability to be able to create it). From the very excellent gameplay to the fun and varied bosses that you encounter.NOTE: This review will change as the game changes, this review is as of 1.8PROS:+ Classic FPS gameplay that you've come to love including Doom and Quake, with over 10 upgrades and fast paced action that many people crave, and NON REGENERATING HEALTH! YES!+ The game is randomly generated and thus there are thousnads of possibilities for level layouts which is actually done really well, with every corner you turn being completley surprising. With over 50 differnt room enviroments its hard to see the same rooms twice on the same floor.+ There are many different bosses that you encounter with over 10 in the game, each with their own moves which are pretty insane to watch, with balls of glowing lime green light flying everywhere as you attempt to dodge them with precise movement, just hoping it will die shortly.+ Variety is a strong point in this game, with many many enemy types and each room having a random layout of enemy in every room, each enemy has its own attack patterns with ninjas that teleport to you in a blaze of white voxel blocks to sharks that dive into the floor leaching up onto you after they swim.CONS: (Unfortinutley this game)+ The music is boring a repedative with only a small handful of tracks that all sound the same.+ The game has its fair share of glitches (Doors closing before you walk into them causing you to be stuck) But it is early access so I can cut it some slack+ The developers have no clue what the hell they want in this game, from discontinuing multiplayer to saying updates would come quickly and sadly have come at a crawl.+ The level's appearance doesnt change often enough (the first 5 levels use the same wall texture and gets bland and tidious after a while) And the bosses aren't really seen as bosses as nothing happens when you enter the room it just spawns and a health bar appears, a nice boss spawning track or some sound effects would really help.+ Movement doesn't feel right, the lack of bobbing correctly to the very slow walking speed at the start doesn't work well with a game that depends on fast paced movementOVERALL:This game does have plenty of falws in it from glitches and the lazy developers but I keep coming back to this game, why? Because, its fun gameplay, great level layout and enemy variety really makes this game fun to me. I recomend only getting this game if it goes on sale in its current state, because currently it is a very fun game but there isn't enough variety from its very huge variety to make it worth it.			"

								Very fun! Intense action, highly reflexive shooter.If you like quick reflex shooters where you move all crazy-fast (think Unreal Tournament) and you like rogue-likes such ad Binding of Isaac or Risk of rain then you might really like this. However! Do not be fooled by the early-access label, as it has become quite clear that updates are no longer planned to be implemented. So watch the video and expect to get what you see, this is a great get-in-play-get-out game that you can fit into just about any timeframe.			"

The game is pretty good for an early-access game, but it could still use some work. I would like to see some kind of save mode and more starting options. Other than that the game is pretty decent and worth it. I look forward to when it is fully released.			"

								About 10 minutes of gameplay tells you that there isn't much to this game. It's trying too hard to be The Binding Of Issac from the Quake mindset but lacks of the soul of both of those games. I should state that I have sunk about an hour into a DRM free copy and I have done a few levels but there really isn't anything to this game it states ""Early Access"" but it really feels like the devs aren't adding anymore to this game and it may as well be out at this point. Maybe I just enjoy real ""rogue-likes"", where some thought had gone into this game. This feels like an poor XBox Indie Game and nothing more.			"

								Well, to be honest I am a bit divided about this game.  I really wanted to reccommend it to everyone, it looked and functioned for the most part how I expected it would.  A simple, pixelated shooter with Rogue like elements.  That being said..the developers promised multiplayer multiple times.  I bought into this game rather late into it's development.  However it was promised on Steam, and judging by various Forum posts it was promised elsewhere as well.  However, it is not just the Multiplayer that detracts from this game for me.  It's just not that fun..well, at all after awhile.  The challenge overides the novelty of it all and even though a rogue-like seems fun..it doesn't quite add up.  Progressing a level or two, getting killed and then reset all the way back to the beginning can be a bit annoying.  Not just that though, I mean there is no story to the game which for the most part is barebones as it is.  The developers have also been agressive towards player criticism in the past..never a good sign when you can't take criticism.  2 out of 5.			"

								This is a very fun, but very unfinished game. Just know that going in. The game is difficult, close to Quake's ""nightmare"" setting, and—true to the roguelike ethos—rarely gives you a fair fight. Bad runs are still fun, and good runs are exhilarating. On downside, the multiplayer coop has been cancelled (which sucks but it's not for the developers' lack of trying). Two more patches are planned before it's complete; but your money gets you solid, hard-as-diamonds old school FPS gameplay. And that ain't bad.			"

												As of now, I find Paranautical Activity to be lack luster if anything. A rogue-like FPS could have been really intuative, yet the controls feel clumsy and the difficulty feels to brash.It tries to play on an ""Items to make it easier"" system like Binding of Issac yet going room to room is unpredictable and ends up biting you in the♥♥♥♥♥ Sure Binding of Issac can screw you over if you explore but that's usually in later levels, Paranautical Activity does this on the first level!As I said the controls feel clunky (At least it does on my 360 controller) and the game tries to be too fast paced for it's on good. Doom was great as a fast paced game, but yet Doom didn't have unpassable rooms because you didn't defeat all the monsters (not all the time at least from my memory.) There is a sprint button, yet it completely ♥♥♥♥s with your aim. Doom also had a sprint command but in Doom you can't look up or down and your weapon ""auto-locks) on the enemies you aim at. Over all Paranautical Activity is taking too much influence from other games too the point where it is completely miss using what concepts it's taking. Difficulty in a game is fine when presented in increments, but I haven't even made it past the first level.			"

												An FPS roguelike that takes a lot of inspiration from Binding of Isaac. There is far less depth in terms of item synergy, item creativity, and strategy, but this is a fun game. The level design is good, the graphical style is simple and effective, and monsters all have distinctive designs and attack patterns. Most importantly though, firing weapons in this game just feels really damn good.In conclusion: If you ever wanted to see The Binding of Isaac done as an FPS, this is the closest you can get as far as I know.

												Paranautical Activity ReviewFor me: 7/10 For others 3/10Let's just be honest right off the bat: you might not like this game. It's not nearly as replayable as other roguelikes, maybe 20 hours at most. it's very repetetive, which is something I personally am okay with, but many people aren't. The power ups aren't interesting, the gameplay is pretty good, even if it's just strafing in a circle for every boss or room, dodging is annoying especially with homing shots. for homing shots, the only way to dodge it is cling against the wall so the bullet flies into the wall. There are some things in the game that make it very laggy, making me rush to kill the boss before it lags too hard ( talking about the snail boss ). it's not well optimized for sure. But it's fun to play in my opinion! Like, it's almost literally binding of Isaac in FPS form! If you are fine with all these cons, then this game should be plenty fun for you!			"

												Simple and fun, took me a while to get used to the old schools style strafing again.  Areas are cool for voxel, guns feel different from eachother(wish there were more on offer at game start). baddies act differently requiring you to learn each pattern. Very hard. ive gotten to the second stage with the Tank class(High hp) but because of the randomly dropped loot, and my want to clear every room gets me killed before I can go further.  I poke at the game every so often, but the difficulty is off-putting, along with the lack of things to do if you cant beat the first mode. if you want a fast minecraft looking shooter that requires you to jump-turn-attack and toss-bombs at the same time PA's good.  If you have ever played Dark Souls and gave up at the first boss, skip it.			"

												7/10A fun roguelike shooter with pixelated graphics. Not the best in its genre, but fun nonetheless.In Paranautical Activity, you have a few classes to pick and they differ in speed, damage, fire rate, health and starting weapons. After picking your character, you'll be traversing through randomly generated rooms, defeating enemies on the way, collecting money and using said money to buy upgrades when you come to a room with items for sale. At the end of each level, you'll fight a boss before progressing to the next level.The main issue with the game is that it can be very confusing at times. As a roguelike game, it's expected that the game won't hold your hand and a lot of trial-and-error will be involved, but even then the game does little to tell you what each item does. The game could certainly benefit with being at least slightly more descriptive.Another issue is that because rooms look mostly the same and enemies repeat themselves a lot as well, the game can become quite repetitive.In comparison to games like Tower of Guns or Ziggurat, it doesn't stand out, but it's still recommended for those who enjoy roguelike shooters.

												Paranautical Activity is truly something special. I remember back when the game was in early access and how the developers were pretty much neglecting their fanbase. I think it took them like 8 months to fix a couple of bugs yet everyone was in shock that the game wasn't abandoned. Now, I haven't really followed the controversy surrounding the game since I'm not interested in developer drama but I am glad that the current developers are actually putting effort into it. The game itself, to me personally, is nothing more than a nice time waster. Kind of like The Binding of Isaac, you play in randomly generated levels with rooms you must clear in order to advance to the next floor. What differentiates it from other so-called ""time wasters"", however, is the pure adrenaline you get from fighting multiple enemies or hugh mungus bosses. Even though I haven't played many rogue likes (mostly because I'm not a fan of the genre), I think this game is a great introduction. Your reflexes and coordination will be put to the test, along with your sense of direction in the sometimes overwhelmingly confusing levels. The voxel graphics are nice to look at for what they are though the level design is pretty bland and not memorable in the slightest.I'd personally recommend the game if you find it on sale. I see a lot of people saying Ziguratt is better and even though I haven't played it, they seem like two entirely different games. While there are certainly better games than this one, I think you will have a good time with Paranautical Activity.			"

												I'm not a big fan of roguelikes, and I'm not very good at them.  This game has a lot of good things going for it, but fell just short of being great.  If you're a fan of roguelike fps games, then it's worth a try.   However, be aware that the learning curve may be steep.  There's no single starting character that is well balanced for someone new to the game.Pros-Great music.  The music may be the best part, imo.  I don't know if I'd call it dubstep, as the outline has.-The voxel artwork is interesting, and the bosses are all pretty great in their own ways.-The Seafarers Guide pdf is useful and the mini documentary is interesting. (To find it, right click your game and click properties, then click the ""local files"" tab and ""browse local files"")-I believe a lot of thought was put into the pickups and weapons and effects and differentiating objects from each other.Cons-There's no well balanced character for a begginning player to pick up the game quickly with.-It's not obvious what pickups do.  The seafarers guide will tell you, and google might.  -A lot of pickups can be detrimental to gameplay, and those seem to be the items I get most.  For example, I seem to get a lot of slow down items when I'm the tank until I move too slow to get out of the way of anything.-When there are a lot of particles on the screen it can be hard to tell what's going on (this may just be an unavoidable side effect of bullet hell shooters)-The menus can feel a little cheap.  I can't put my finger on why exactly.  But they're menus, so they don't really matter.  They are the introduction to the game.  Also,  the Unity frontloader always feels kind of amateur(cookie cutter) to me. Moving the controller options and video options into the main game menu and dropping the frontloader would have remedied that.  Again, it really has no effect on gameplay, so it's not a big deal to me.-On my machine, in OSX, there seems to be some issues with music lagging and possibly other kinds of lag.  An fps counter would be nice, so I could know for sure.  This could just be my machine, or just OSX.  I don't know.-The controversy surrounding this game is highly disconcerting.  I hope those at fault learned the right lessons from the experience, and that everyone involved was compensated fairly for their efforts.Games are hard as hell to make, and overall I feel like this was a really good effort.  Without the controversy, and with some incremental improvements, I feel like this game could have gone much further, and been a lot more successful. "
