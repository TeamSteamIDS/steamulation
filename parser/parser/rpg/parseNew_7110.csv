												The game itself is brilliant, unfortunately, Valve is distributing it in a broken, unplayable state for most windows Vista/7/8 users. This requires users to hack the install directory by renaming files, or to seek to resolve the problem by more convoluted and risky means.It is of course BioWare's responsibility to fix this, but Valve is still selling it, and it's unacceptable that people feel the need to download anonymous executables off the internet in order to play a game they purchased.If you feel like dealing with the head ache of trying to get this broken product to work, it's actually a very good game. It starts a little slow but you encounter lots of interesting characters, make lots of decisions that impact how things turn out, develop relationships with party members, get multiple endings, and can unlock a lot of cool powers. It's a very good game, it's like a pre-cursor to Mass Effect but JadeEmpireConfig.exe is broken and results in a Can't Find Steam error.Oh the solution to the Can't Find Steam error? SimpleMake a backup of JadeEmpireLauncher.exe, create a copy of JadeEmpire.exe, and rename that copy to JadeEmpireLauncher.exe. Then run it in XP Compatibility Mode with Run as Administrator checked. For most people, this solves the problem. I'm sorry you had to look for a work around like this to make a game you spent money on playable.			"

												Waste of money. I've played this game in the past and it's a great game. The game is not the problem, getting it to run is. The host of known problems with the Steam version continues to grow. First you will be greeted by the ""Failed to find Steam"" error. This can be corrected by running both the Steam app and the Jade Empire game as administrator. Once you get past that you will be greeted by the configuration screen which will crash while trying to detect your hardware. I hear the only fix for this is changing the registry but I could be wrong.If you manage to get past these errors (and a few brave and knowlegable souls have) You will likely run into the game crashing on you upon launch. In short this is not a game so much as a program designed to crash your computer. I hear there are patches you can download from various sites but you risk downloading viruses too. Make a mistake trying to change the registry yourself and you just might end up reformatting your hard drive. It's far less painful to just stay away from this POS that will fight you at every turn as you try to get it to launch. Sometimes it will even mock you by making you think it's about to run only to crash and laugh in your face. Stay away!			"

 Steam Version == BROKEN I cannot recommend the Steam version in its current state, simply because it's broken (i.e. ""non-working"") beyond belief. This seems to not only be because of a ""we don't care"" attitude on Bioware's part, but also on Valve/Steam parts for letting things into the Steam shop that obviously haven't been QA'd AT ALL. This basically forces users to ""jumping through hoops"" like resorting to running Steam as Administrator, ""registry hacking"", manipulating broken config game files, renaming game executables and so on, without any guarantee that the game will run in the end anyway. Most of the problems are well-known (i.e. mentioned numerous times on forums here at Steam and Bioware), but there seem to be neither official solutions nor statements nor any signs of pressure from Steam towards Bioware to fix it.* ""Can't Find Steam error"" : The most blatant proof that Steam didn't QA the Steam Version. The initial setup will throw this error message at your face unless you start the STEAM CLIENT itself in Administrator Mode (!). As the game requires admin privileges, and Interprocess Communcation between game and steam (with Steam_api.dll for Overlay / DRM) requires both executables to have admin privileges. Basic programming mistake on Biowares part? Non-existing QA on Steam's part?* Verify integrity of the game cache throws you into a loop: Got ""2 files failed and will be reaquired"" every time you try from the steam client? In this case: Good luck. (Steam's fault)* Crashing Game Configuration Dialog: The game configuration laucher crashes while trying to discover your hardware? You're out of luck unless you start renaming files / editing the registry / create a valid xml config file. (Bioware's fault)* Dead-locking game right at the beginning: You only get the initial loading screen where you only see a background image? Afaik, there is no known solution to this problem at this time. (Bioware's fault)There are speculations that the last 2 points might be caused by the ""Optimus"" technology from NVidia (modern Laptops with dedicated graphics cards have 2 cards: One integrated HDxxxx Intel version inside your CPU and one dedicated NVidia / ATI card). If that were true, it would mean that most laptops with dedicated graphic hardware (from NVidia) won't run this game at all. This is only *speculation* though.TL;DR version: DON'T BUY! Unless Valve / Steam starts putting serious pressure towards Bioware to fix the plethora of issues nothing will be done, and the version offered in the shop will remain broken.  "

												I enjoyed this game when I played it on the original Xbox and grabbed this off a Steam Sale. However, this port seems to be broken. I can't launch the game and going to the forums just shows that I am in the company of hundreds of others who also can't launch the game. The game is good, but the port is broken.

												Played this a few years ago and I loved it. Had troubles starting the game on the steam version, but I found the solution after just a quick search. A rather nice gem from Bioware; one that is not as popular as their other games, but is about as good. Expect the quality story and role playing that Bioware is known for. Don't let an easily solvable compatibility issue keep you away from this experience.			"

												The game itself is great, but the Steam version does not work without modifying your system files. You need to follow the guides to get it able to run, then after the game starts, it runs very choppy.The GOG version is better, it installs the DirectX files that's needed and works smoothly after a reboot. I would recommend getting that version instead.			"

												Despite the old graphics and occasional clunkiness, I think this is one of my newest favorite games. I was surprised by how well it stands up against the newer titles. If anything, the fact that this came before many of Bioware's other titles elevates it to a higher status for my regard.The rundown:Graphics:This is an old game, and as such, will have old graphics. Textures aren't particularly high, faces can be a touch blobby, and clothing moves like awkward paper. I also found the cutscenes, while also marked with the usual low quality of the time, also had a strange film grain effect. This may be removable, but I never found it so pressing as to search for the option. Some of the cutscenes that involved content of a more gory/violent/disturbing nature did not appear so, though one's imagination can fill in the gaps (this may be a pro or con). Overall, I found the graphics acceptable for serving their task.Audio:I enjoyed the musical score, particularly the swells that appeared during the more intense moments in the game. I'll probably go see if I can hunt down the OST (EDIT: found the OST. It's still great). As for the dialog, I found the majority of major characters to have intriguing voices, and rarely felt the need to read the subtitles and skip when speaking with them. This was not always the case with the minor characters. I suspect the voices themselves are more than decent, but the lack of camera movement during a conversation could become a little stale (a flaw of the time, I would think). Characters:Unsurprisingly, this is where the high quality really shone through. Although there weren't as many opportunities as I would have liked to interact and speak with the companions (though to be fair, that's always my complaint), I found their backstories interesting and genuinely wished to know more about them throughout the game. I wouldn't have minded a few more side quests, or the ability to take more than one companion along, as I found myself taking the same two out. This just means further playthroughs are needed for the future.Story:What I liked about it was its seeming simplicity. It began in a rather straight forward manner, following some of the usual tropes. However, as the story progressed, I enjoyed seeing the new twists, and I wish to give particular commendation to some of the aspects in the ending. Unlike some of Bioware's more recent titles, I really wasn't certain if I'd made the 'right' choice (assuming there had been others - I've only played through once, following the Open Hand path). This ambiguity was very appreciated, and it's something I'm still thinking about. Some form of sequal would have really been fantastic, as I would have loved to see what my impact on the Jade Empire ultimately ended up being.In short, despite the aging, I found the game to be extremely entertaining, and possibly a necessary staple to anyone curious about playing more Bioware games. I can definitely see myself replaying it. For information purposes, my playtime ended up being 23 hours.One last note: The steam edition of Jade Empire had this issue where upon startup, it would tell it 'couldn't find steam' or some such drivel, and then promptly close. The fix was relatively easy. Exit steam entirely, and then run it as administrator, and then start Jade Empire. That should allow the configuration paths to form correctly (I believe that was where the issue lay, but I can't be certain. Regardless, the game worked normally for me then on out).			"

Introduction: Jade Empire won my heart several years ago, when I first played it on the original XBOX. For those of you who are familiar with BioWare products, it will come as no surprise that Jade Empire lives up to being a quality role-playing game. Clearly inspired by ancient Chinese mythology and folklore, this game is both alluring and enticing to players who can appreciate compelling storytelling combined with a refreshing cast of characters. While this particular title has a relatively simple design in comparison to many of BioWare's other creations, I would still encourage you to pick it up and check it out - Particularly if you are interested in refreshingly original environments, and parables.Complications & Fixes:While I recommend the game itself to anyone, I must ADVISE CAUTION TO THOSE SEEKING TO BUY IT ON STEAM. For some, the game will not operate smoothly (if at all) without downloading and installing an additional file. For those of you still needing help, there are many thread discussions regarding this error inside the community forums. Alternatively, you can download and install the two files that I used (they worked for me) from: https://anonfiles.com/file/2fd02e0d0446d3bcaa2c6b2d1fd85d8dFor reference, I believe this is the thread where I originally found the solution: http://steamcommunity.com/app/7110/discussions/0/864978835694348660Story: Jade Empire follows an orphaned martial arts student, initially training under Master Li, who is unaware of his/her full potential... Or for that matter, the road that lies ahead of them. Little does the protagonist know that every step of the journey will be a test of character, which might or might not conflict with their martial skills. While facing other-worldly creatures, in a unique combat system, the student will grow to master his/her ability -  and only then can they face the dark power growing in the Jade Empire. This game does feature multiple endings based on the players path and decisions throughout the game.Gameplay: The story is absolutely gripping, and is divided into 7 chapters, each featuring their own set of sub-quests.  Some quests are entirely optional, such as the option to form a romantic relationship with a NPC team member. I was honestly very impressed by some of the same-sex options, considering the release date of Jade Empire. This might actually be one of the first games that provided this option to the player. Throughout the game, the player will be able to make decisions for their character, which can in fact impact the ending. Furthermore, some of these decisions can also be used to influence your party members into following different paths as well.There are two major philosophies that seem crucial to the game as well: The Way of the Open Palm, and the Way of the Closed Fist. These two opposing philosophies can easily compare to Yin and Yang (or the Dark Side and the Light Side from Star Wars). However, it is important to recognize that just because someone practices the Way of the Closed Fist does not actually mark them as evil... Likewise, a follower of the Open Palm is not automatically good either. Followers of the Open Palm believe that maintaining harmony is important, whereas the followers of the Closed Fist believe that one should become self-reliant. Whether or not an individual is good or evil boils down to the context surrounding the event, so Jade Empire strays from painting a black and white world. That in itself, is a noteworthy mention, all too rare in video games.Another brilliant feature implemented in Jade Empire are the mini-games. I really really really enjoyed the Raiden-inspired Dragonfly mini-game. Seriously, just go check it out on YouTube or something, you could spend hours doing this alone. It is sooo fun!Controls: I might have been lucky, but I didn't have any problems with the controls in this game. They were pretty straightforward, and the game is compatible with a XBOX360 controller. On the other hand, a friend of mine confirmed that Jade Empire is not compatible with the PS3 controller. Otherwise, the controls work perfectly fine for me, as to be expected. The combat system is a bit more complex than other games I've played, but the innovative style is addicting, I promise.Graphics: The first thing to consider is that this game came out in 2005. As a result, the graphics might be considered outdated by many of you. However, I do not feel like the graphics are so outdated that they become a distraction. The visual aesthetic of the game may not be the best, but it's definitely not the worst.  I rather enjoy the art style of this game, however I cannot say that the graphics are the highlight of Jade Empire either... And yes, you will get stuck in weird camera angles until you reload it sometimes. There are glitches. Do not panic. Sound: I think the language might be made up, but it sounds decent to me. The voice acting wasn't horribly obnoxious, and some of the music in this game is enjoyable to listen to. The audio surrounding this game meets par, as there isn't a lot to nit-pick.Replay Value: Honestly, Jade Empire doesn't get old to me. I found the experience to be extremely enjoyable, and have since beaten the game several times since my first playthrough in 2005. Definitely worth playing twice!			"

												First I want to say that the game itself is good. Once I scoured the internet looking for the way to fix it it works well and is fun.However, and this is a big however, It does not work as is downloaded from steam. You have to go download some random guy's .exe modified to work with win 7/8.If you don't care about doing that then by all means this is a great game with a unique combat system and intriguing story.

												I bought this game with the Steam discount offer (75% of its price) and I must say the money is well spent. After playing it I'd say even the full-price would be well spent money.Story-wise, the game got me hooked from the start to the end. It might looks a bit cliché at the beginning, but there are many twists in the plot and there are a couple of features that really make the game a very good product. The graphics might not the  best around but I didn't realy care much about it. Bioware makes a good use of romances (both heterosexual and homosexual) even if they're not the focus of the game. The combat system is fast paced and much more technical than other Bioware titles (mostly because this was intended as a X-Box game, then ported to the PC version), but I enjoyed it and never found it frustrating. That said I would really recommend this game to people who enjoy ancient Mongolia/China settings, mixed with magic, mythology, kung-fu monks and action roleplaying games.			"

												C'mon!  Wonderful game, most deserving of its acclaim and rating. However, this is a fundementally flawed version of the game whos antiquated engine works about as well with newer Windows OS's as John Wayne would with Ace Hood. I dont know why Valve doesn't feel they need to disclose these issues, but I do know that i'm glad I bought this on sale and I only wasted $6 rather than $15.

												When you think of Bioware, you usually either associate the company with either hilariously over the top fantasy romance, gritty bloody or D&D Fantasy and sci-fi moral guided RPG shoot from cover games.But there was a time where they worked on a game with a very different setting and combat system. This is the game, and the settling is the sadly rarely used Chinese Fantasy. Jade Empire is a very different beast for what we now expect from modern Bioware games. Originally for the first Xbox and ported to the PC around 2007 back in the days where STEAM was also very different and oddly enough not well remembered.I had fun playing Jade Empire. It was something new, despite the now dated graphics. It was something fresh despite the system limitations like being limited to a single companion and being one of the shorter Bioware games I have played. A good game always has a rock solid foundation. Very few games bother to cover China at all.  The combat system in this game is very unique and reminds me a lot of the more modern but quite different open world game Sleeping Dogs. You fight with WASD, general movement and using techniques (spells) that are fueled by a chi (mana) meter. This makes fighting a lot more fluid and interesting that the usual turn based stuff older RPG games are associated with and there is a simple wonder of going all Bruce Lee (and yes, one of the male main character models pretty much is a tribute to Bruce Lee) and kicking♥♥♥♥♥while staying mobile.You aren't limited to your fists, there is the usual slightly bland array of metal weaponry and Chinese Magic style techniques some of which transform you into mythical fantasy beasts of the era. The companions themselves, whilst limited in combat are quite interesting like with all Bioware games. There is even the token 'Drunken Style Master' who helps boost you with buffs of well wine really. One of my personal favourite quests in the game is a much more interesting Arena quest that makes the younger Oblivion one seem hilariously bland and boring in comparism. Oh and John Cleese has a cameo too in which he plays an Arrogant♥♥♥♥♥♥of an Elizbethan Explorer who debates and fights you.Sadly there are some flaws. Like I mentioned before the game is short, I played it one and off for an hour or two for the last few weeks and just shaved past the eighteen hour mark before completing it. Once you finish the Imperial City portion of the game pacing gets incredibly rushed and the scant quest based hub areas vanish completely. The storyline demands you to get it done and over with. And the Gem system really could have done with some more thought. But these things are pretty minor. The most disturbing issue was the fact this game is one of the older titles that is broken due to STEAM constantly changing but I found a player bashed up fix in the STEAM community forums which was easily to install and get working in about a minute.So final opinion really, if you are looking for something new and interesting in both setting and combat system RPG wise and don't mind the length and the age of the game you will enjoy Jade Empire. If you don't click with Martial Arts, Fantasy China or would rather have a more relaxed combat system I might suggest looking into amazingly well written Planescape Torment instead which is different enough to take a break from the more boring old school RPG games.Worth picking up in a sale if it sparks your interest? Go ahead. Even outside the sale, the price is still pretty cheap and it will run like a charm now even on what we would consider old hardware in space year 2013/14.			"

												****WARNING: PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASE*****TWO GAME BREAK BUGS PREVENT PLAY ON WINDOWS 7/8, FIXES BELOW*This is an EXCELLENT game, an ancient chinese mythology version of KOTOR. However, this steam version WILL NOT launch on Windows 7 and 8 without a few back end tweeks. Lots of google investigation returned a lot of confusion. But I found the proper way to get this game running. Do the following semi-easy fixes depending on the errors you receive:""FAILED TO FIND STEAM"" BUG This is because this game was made for older OSes, where steam is typically located in C: Programs, not C: Programs(x86). In order to fix this do the following:1. In your Jade Empire folder change the file ""JadeEmpireLauncher.exe"" to ""JadeEmpireLauncher_Backup""2. In the same folder rename JadeEmpire.exe to JadeEmpireLauncher.exe3. Right click My Computer(Called This PC in windows 8.1) and go to properties, then click Advanced System Settings, under the adavanced tab, click Enviroment Variables. Look for the ""Path"" variable, high light it and the edit button. A window will pop up. Put your cursor in the ""Path Variable"", it will be a Path to your Program(x86) folder. Go to the very end of the path already in there and add a ; a SEMI-COLON, NOT a : colon. This is going to seperate the first path from the new one.4. After that semi colon, simply put in the past to steam that you use such as: C:\Program Files (x86)\steam. Hit Okay.5. Please, REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER <- THIS IS IMPORTANT For some reason this game won't register this change unless you reboot.""IN GAME STUTTERING"" BUGGREAT! You made it into the game. But it's running with this horrendous unplayable stutter even though you are running at a solid 30-60 FPS. Here is how you fix it:1. Go to Jade Empire folder. 2. Open the JadeEmpire.ini file with notepad.3. Find the entry ClampFPS=1 and change the 1 to a 0.4*. (If you are only running one video card, skip to 5)  If you are on a gaming laptop that runs a high performance video card alongside an intergrated one, this game almost ALWAYS will naturally try to run off the integrated card instead of the good card. Go into Your card's control panel and under 3d settings, click Add Program, select Jade Empire, then change it from Integrated to High Performance Card.5. Turn off the steam overlay by selecting Steam->Settings->In-Game->Uncheck Enable Steam overlay.6.And as always after doing this, REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER. The game WILL NOT recognize it if you don't.This is a GREAT game and a lot of fun. But it wasn't updated for newer systems. These fixes aren't as hard as they found, Give them a shot.			"

												I would definitively recommend this game, it starts slowly but as I progressed in the story I appreciated it more and more, despice some flaws in the gameplay and the annoying bioware ""black & white"" morality system.Technics:win 7 + xbox controller, no problems , nothing to complain about.Gameplay:The controlls are a bit rusty and at times ungainly, it doesn't respond as well as it should, making it at time very difficult to resolve a fight. The advanced combat style system, while a good idea could do with some streamlining, there are almost too many styles (something between 15 and 20) but you end up using only a couple of them exclusively. The combat in itself can range from very difficult (even with a controller) to smash a button simple. Bioware should have remembered they are first and foremost a RPG company, action is not their fortes.Still when you get the hang of it, the fights are usually fun and very kung-fu likes , I only wished it had been a bit simpler and more responsive.The RPG part is working nicely, although it sometimes feel like we could do with a little less dialogue, but like in many bioware games we feel obliged to go though everything a character has to say just in case something interessting is hiding in the choices. Graphics and soundsFor a game this age I'm agreably surprised with the nice graphics. The background landscapes are beautifully rendered with a lot of colour , the music and sounds goes nicely with it giving it a distinctively fantasy oriental feeling. Yes it's dated but at anno 2015 I didn't have any problem with it, and as the game went on, I was actually more and more impressed about the nice backgrounds and objects put in the game. The characters look quite nice , maybe a bit boring but nothing too serious. The attention to the details is maybe what impressed me most, everything feel very oriental, from the design of GUI to the music or the decorations, very nice.PlotAt first it doesn't really engage, but after an hour of two the game become more and more exciting, the characters who start at bit bland become more fleshed out and interesting and the quests and surroundings get better and better. In fact the game get really interessting 1\3 into the story when you reach the capital. In short it might seem a bit boring at first but things get better with time, give it a chance.Toward the end it get really amazing and I have to say it's one of the most engaging RPG I have played for a long time. The story is much better than NWN2 (expensions included) and the ending is much better than masseffect and even KOTOR 1. The Bioware ""morality"" system however annoyed me with it's very basic evil and good choices. It's very black and white and counterintuitive , bioware doesn't manage to give us clear motivations to behave like a ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" , most people will naturally choice the ""good-guy"" choices especially when being a bad guy doesn't give you any clear advantages. This is not a new problem for bioware RPG however and it's something most of us have learned to live with in those games. Still a bit annoying.The story start a bit tame, but it very soon become a lot more exciting. In fact towad the end I was really engrossed in it and the game amazed me more and more as I progressed. The story is one of the best I've experienced in a RPG for quite some times and it's very refreshing.ConclusionsThe game has its flaws, but mostly it's great  especially if you like a great and engrossing story. The beginning is a bit tame, and take some time to familiarise yourself with the controlls which can feel cluncky at time. But as a whole the great story and interessant characters make it worth your time, I definitively recommend this game.			"

												AMAZING GAME! I would recomend this to high heavens and then a little further.Great Bioware story that is hidden behind a slightly unforgiving but pretty fun combat mechanic. I also love all the martial arts that the game is set around, so much like a wuxia Bioware.But SCREW THE STEAM VERSION WITH A POWER DRILL. I'm not exactly sure if you can get this better on gog or torrenting the damn thing, but the Steam version is SO DAMN BROKEN that it has gone beyond funny, you need to mess with dlls just so it understand that it's on Steam, and that's just starters.Play this game, please, make this game a non-hidden gem and maybe Bioware decides that Jade Empire 2 is better then whatever the ♥♥♥♥ Andromeda is. But find it ELSEWHERE!			"

												Love this game. Love it, love it, want to marry it, love it.The cons first: the combat can be a little dull or weird. That is literally it. And I still really liked the combat. I imagine others might not, but it's hardly a dealbreaker level of weird.You can tell from the get go this is a Bioware game - rich characters, a massive over arching story with multiple acts, and amazing world building. The combat is different to any other I've experienced, with a massive martial arts emphasis while still being the kind of ""pause and fight"" type deal you get in KOTOR or Mass Effect. Every aspect is well thought out and brilliant.I'm so disappointed there weren't more games in this series. I really recommend giving this a go and falling in love with it as I have.			"

												As it currently stands, if you have the past several versions of Windows this game will not run without some creative workarounds. Fixing the problem should only take you a few minutes, but the fact that the game is being sold in this condition - that it comes out of the box unworkable - does not speak well.Content wise, it's a nice look into the past of Bioware RPGs. There are rough spots - I don't remember the combat being this annoying - but overall Jade Empire is a very rewarding experience. It IS worth the money for a nostalgia purchase if you have the patience to deal with the setup issues, but I just can't recommend it until appropriate support comes along.			"

												#Note: Will require some change of settings to get it to work on Win8/Win10; I got mine to work by doing the below things:-Set all .exe files (JadeEmpire.exe, JadeEmpireLauncher.exe, JadeEmpireConfig.exe, TestApp.exe) to run by Administrator with compatability mode for Windows XP (SP3).-Copy Steam.dll from %\Steam\ to %\Steam\steamapps\common\Jade Empire-Create a blank file named SystemInformation.xml in %\Steam\steamapps\common\Jade Empire\dataI originally played this game on XBOX back when it was first released and have decided to give it another go. Game is just as fun as it was when I played it 10 years ago and doesn't appear to have aged too badly. Recommend if you enjoyed the mass effect series as the game runs a similar story engine. I played using a third party controller and x360ce and it has worked fine throughout.Brief Overview:Jade Empire is set in a feudal China like setting named Jade Empire, a large empire ruled and controlled by the Emporer Sun Hai. Your character is an orphan, orphaned by the expansion of the Jade Empire and has been adopted and trained by Master Li in the remote town of Two Rivers. The last of a line of now extinct monks, your character has a large part to play in the destiny of the world.The game features live-action fighting combat utilizing a variety of fighting, weapon and magical styles, and a chat system featuring an allignment gain similar to that of the Mass Effect series.Play through should last approximately 20-30 hours. Definitely a game worth a look at if it comes up on steam sale! "

												This is one of the best action rpgs ever made. It has a great morality system that fits with the martial arts theme. The combat is very easy to learn, and takes a while to master the different forms of combat. The characters you get along the way all have very detailed stories. There are many ways you can grow your own character and those with you. The villains and enemeies are very well done. There is a pretty big plot twist that just makes it even better. I am hoping Bioware makes a remake or a sequal to this outstanding game.			"

												Jade Empire could easily been seen as the first step for Bioware towards more simplistic and action based gameplay however it manages to avoid the scorn many felt towards the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series by providing a beautiful and inspired world, the writing is excellent and the characters are interesting.You start the game off as a student at a martial arts academy. Things quickly change however as you are charged with saving the world and restoring balance in the world, pretty standard hero stuff really. You won't be on your great all important quest for long before some random peasant will ask you go save a cat from a tree however. Jade Empire is a game that loves procrastinating. Despite what should be a fairly urgent overall plot you will find yourself spending most of your time solving the problems of various little people around the world. Sometimes I'd even forget why I was doing all this in first place.Jade Empire is gorgeous game. The graphics are stunning, the art style is impressive and the sounds and music work well together.There is a certain open feeling to many of the quests and although this is only a disguise for the relatively linear progression you have throughout the game it does work well to keep you from feeling like you are completely on rails. The morality system, despite it's flaws, is probably one of the best ones ever concocted by Bioware and it hints at shades of grey quite often, particularly during the later stages of the game.There is only really one major problem with Jade Empire and it is unfortunately a rather big one. The combat, the basic gameplay mechanic that the entire game is based around, is dreadfully dull.The controls are fairly standard, light attack to deal damage, heavy attack to break blocks, your own blocking ability and an area effect strike in case you get swarmed. This is all very simple and not very interesting so what Bioware did in an attempt to make the combat more dynamic is provide you with a wide range of combat styles. Everything from familiarly named martial arts styles and weapons styles to magic and support styles and even transformation styles that morph you into various mythical creatures. The idea being that you need to switch between the different styles to maximize your combat potential. Unfortunately the entire execution of this is flawed and while you do need to change styles every blue moon to match enemy immunities there will only rarely be a need to do this in combat even on the highest level of difficulty.Something that probably deserves a mention here is that Jade Empire is some very nice romance options and is quite possibly the only game to have a three-way romance option that didn't make me feel like puking.All in all Jade Empire is a great game marred by some unfortunate design flaws. The world is beautiful and well crafted, the characters are interesting and engaging and Bioware's attempt at grey morality pays off surprisingly well. It's a game I'd happily recommend as it is a great play but the horrible combat unfortunately keeps it from getting that all time classic status that some seem to want to bestow upon it.			"

												Jade Empire is an underrated gem. Story, setting, characters everything is quite fine.  The way it unfolds sometimes even surpised me, as i played lots of cRpgs. Although your chocies between open palm and closed fist are quite obvious unlike Planescape:Torment, their results are almost always satisfactory. Side characters are deep enough, there is a well balanced humor in game which i like. Combat system is mostly balanced and also quite challenging in high difficulties. If you do not consult walkthroughs and tactics from web, more so. Some styles are bit less balanced but it's OK. Combat system is around 4 basic different types of styles. These are weapon, martial, support and magic. There are lots of styles under these branches adding up variations. You almost always have more than one way of defeating hard fights. Don't miss if you love RPG's. I am running it Under Windows 10 64 Bit; played with win7 64 bit before also, without any problems.  You just have to do some tweaking for game to run better. But all of these take no more than mere  10 minutes. You have to run steam client as administrator.You have to edit JadeEmpire.ini  details are explained perfectly here 


How to fix poor performance/stuttering in Jade Empire 
A Guide for Jade Empire: Special Edition
By: Vapor Gator

			Bought this classic RPG and are disappointed with how it performs on your more than competent rig? Here's a very simple solution that should get Jade Empire playing smooth as silk!		


Also win10 never ""really"" shutdowns your pc most of the time. So if your pc is open for extended periods suddenly Jade Empire ( and many old games possibly ) begun to stutter. Just restart windows. ( You can check up time from task manager-> performance when cpu is highlighted)			"

												Jade Empire is without a doubt a very good game. It stands, however, very firmly, as a mid-point between Bioware's other landmark titles: Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect. It is very recognisable as a spiritual successor to the gameplay style of Knights of the Old Republic. On the other hand, you can see much that would go into Mass Effect being developed in Jade Empire. It says more than anything about Jade Empire that I could not write a paragraph in review without mentioning Bioware's other two excellent titles.The characters and their development, the storyline, and quite frankly the world developed around them, simply doesn't live up to the heights generated by the other series mentioned herein. It perhaps helps with immersion that I was a Star Wars fan prior to playing Knights of the Old Republic; but Mass Effect's dramatic introduction of an entirely new universe was simply amazing and Jade Empire achieves nothing of the sort. It is a nice world, more densely populated than Knights of the Old Republic which makes it feel more immersive. But unfortunately it just does not stand out. It is not particularly memorable, and there is virtually no reason at all for the game to be open-world (when it does open up). If you are thorough, there is literally no reason to return to places you have visited in the past in Jade Empire, and that is rather unfortunate. It is an aging game, so the graphics look a little dated at this point but you can still see that for their time they were quite pretty and it does not in any way impact the enjoyability of this title. The gameplay is also quite interesting, very fast-paced and there are a really wonderful array of fighting-styles that your character can learn. Slightly unfortunate, however, is the loss of the ability to play as other characters at will, which was a welcome feature included in Knights of the Old Republic. All in all, this game is definitely worth looking into, especially for fans of Bioware's other excellent RPG titles. I have been rather critical in this review but it is only because Bioware has soared so much higher in other outings and with so much potential it is rather unfortunate that Jade Empire failed to achieve these expectations. Nonetheless, I still consider it one of the better RPG games I have played and would recommend giving it a shot. 8/10.			"

												I've said it before and I'll say it again.....Jade Empire will stand the test of time. That being said, Jade Empire was a thing of beauty during its time for fans of the genre. Graphically amazing, story telling amazing, combat system very fun, customization eh... but still sufficient. I played a lot of xbox games when this came out and this was one of the only games besides Halo 2 that had me hooked and I might have needed rehab at the time only to have relapsed with the release of Mass Effect soon after ;P. The main hook for me was and still is the story (and my love for martial arts). Not that the story was over-the-top incredible or bursting with shock and awe but it was truly captivating and realistic because of the connection you develop with the characters like any meaningful story will allow you to do, and so easily. I would recommend this story for anyone who hasn't experienced it yet.OK so like I said for its time the graphics were amazing. but nowadays if your not a fan and your the new guy or gal picking this up you might be uncomfortable with its lack of visual stimulation. Well I might have painted a rough picture of Jade Empires graphics, The game still has 1st gen xbox graphics but there are still many mods out there to enhance this game graphically. What you want to look for in this games beauty are the landscapes and the vibrant far east colors.Combat is fun but a bit rough starting off as per usual. You choose two combat styles to start with and to complement those you get to choose one of two weapons and you can switch between these 3 arts very quickly during battle. There is a tab target to switch through enemies and it is very accessible. The only problem I had was attack speed and positioning, you'll find yourself charging up an attack that takes way too long and doesnt land its target because they had an hour to move >.>. The great thing about this little problem is that you can actually put points into attack speed wooooo! problem fixed you just gotta get good :DWell that concludes my review. You don't find too many games in the genre like this especially not one with an Oriental storyline by Bioware, They did an outstanding job with this title and I hope one day an updated re-release until then ill enjoy this version!

If you don't mind old graphics, and I assume you don't if you play old RPGs, this game is worth playing and I absolutely enjoyed playing it for the whole time! It is set up in an interesting world and it's really entertaining and funny. The combat system isn't that bad as many are saying. It's one of those pre-modern Bioware games - and that's a good thing in my opinion.			"

												I bought Jade Empire when I found it in a bin for exactly 2 euros. Years later I bought it again on steam for another 2 euros. All I can say is: money well spent. A lot of people will tell you that Jade Empire is Bioware's weakest game. When you measure any rpg up to Knights of the Old Republic or the original Mass Effect, chances are your perspective is going to be a bit disadvantageous for Jade Empire. This isn't star wars, and this certainly isn't mass effect, but it is a unique game that has all the makings of greatness.I was bummed out in Knights of the Old Republic when I learned that the combat would be dictated by a D&D dice roll system. This is the kind of uncertainty I hate, the kind of unrefined gameplay that has absolutely no excuse to exist in the modern world. Jade Empire does away with that and gives you live action, direct, fist to face combat. It has aged like a biscuit though. It is tough, rigid, and unrefined by todays standards, but a step up from the roulette style gameplay from Knights. Combat is fun for while, but you'll quickly find yourself looking for ways to dispatch your foes as fast as possible. The game offers various options. Martial Arts allow you to attack your enemies with your bare knuckles and are generally effective against all enemies. Elemental Styles allow you to throw fire or ice (bending if you will) at the cost of chi. Various weapons are very effective against humans, but useless against spirits. Support styles allow you to set up your enemies for a finishing blow. And at a hefty chi price there are the transformation styles that allow your to morph into a being of pure awesome to obliterate your foe. There is plenty of choice for you to customise your style, and the game gives you a fine world to flaunt your skills.Jade Empire is set in an oriental world. Full of references to Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Bhuddist mythology. If you have ever watched Avatar: the Last Airbender then you should get the idea. There aren't many games out there like this and Bioware has done a great job at crafting a world that looks the part. This is the nice thing about Jade Empire. You'll want to walk around and talk to people, help them (or ruin them, you know the drill). In the end though you'll still be after the same thing thing: Saving your master. You play a martial arts student, whose life is uprooted when a secret orderer invades your hometown and kidnaps your master. Que the hero music and get to it. It is a shame Jade Empire has ages so poorly. The controls are fluent as a beached whale, and the character models are not always as polished as they could be. Still, its universe and setting are unique and if you like a decent RPG of westen make then do not hesitate to get this.			"

												First off, it takes like 3 things to fix this just google it, its not hard and im not computer smart by any means, so stop putting negative reviews for being lazy f**ks.Now to Jade Empire... f**king wow. For an old game, it's bloody amazing. I've put in 6-7hours so far and that was just today, I struggled to stop playing I even skipped dinner (I missed F**king steak to keep playing this) The music is awesome and fits so well, the graphics are dated but remind me of Morrowind (greatest game of all time) but what's really got me into Jade Empire was the BADA$$ MOTHERFU**KING KUNG FU FIGHTING! Holy Sh*t YEAH! You do front flips and back slips and side rolls while confusing the f**k out of your target and then just kick there a$$ like the kung fu beast you are. Omg it's down right bloody amazing. But there's more so far the story is really cool aswell, of course being made by Bioware there's tons of dialog and lots about the world to learn. (nothing on the scale of Mass Effect or Dragon Age) but enough to want to learn more. There's orge's and f**king DEMON TOADS! (like wtf!) its a great and very unusual mix of fansty and steampunk with alot of tradtional asian culture put into it. (it's bloody rad)So to sum up if you like Mass effect with Morrowind's style graphics and BEING A KUNG FU MASTER! This is a must have :D Ps. I got it on sale a while back for $3.70 but would of happily paid the $15 so worth it!			"

												Ok, i loved this game. Unfortunatly this game is plagued with problems so i must say for god sakes don't buy it. The first issue you WILL have is it wont connect to steam. It took me a decent time searching and tinkering to get the game to even launch. Next the configuration IS going to crash when you try to run the game. Again searching and tinkering so you can get around that. Now that you finnaly get into the game, surprise. . . You dont have a cursor, the mouse works, you just cant see it. You will need a hefty resolution to get it. All in all, this isnt worth it. You should spend your money on anything else. With all the problems that it has, if i had known, i wouldnt have paid $1 for it. Shame on bioware for not fixing these bugs, that from what i have read, were known about. Ohh and steam didnt mention the plague either. My fault though, i should have done better research. So shame on me for thinking that the listed system requirements were what i needed to run the game.			"

												Another wonderfully immersive story, courtesy of Mike Laidlaw, definitely one of my favourite game writers.  The gameplay itself comfortably varies between breezy and challenging, depending on the gravity of the situation. The martial arts-based combat system makes for a good change of pace as opposed to combat in most classic RPGs. The moral system, similar to those in KOTOR and Mass Effect, grants Jade Empire an additional gameplay dimension, as well as a decent level of replayability. And, for its age, the game features pretty stunning graphics. 9/10, one of my favourite games ever.			"

												After finally getting it to run on Windows 10 I enjoyed it very much. + good character development+ great dialogue lines+ nice combat system+ interesting skill and gem system+ open palm vs closed fist choice system+ multiple ""classes"" and followers to chose from+ funny follower interactions and quite complex choices+ good with a controller, haven't tried keyboard- I was able to yolo everything with the toad demon:Concerned NPC: ""THIS IS A TOUGH OPPONENT, BE ON YOUR GUARD! USE ONLY YOUR STRONGEST ATTACKS!!""Me: *Toad demon form* *Focus* *boing* *boing* *boing* *boing*Concerned NPC: ""You have defeated him. I have never seen such beauty and style in combat. :3 ""Me: ""Yeah, ok""But all in all I loved it. Reminds me of mass effect.			"

												TLDR: Jade Empire's Steam edition has horrible frame rate issuses that wont be fixed. The edition on Origin runs amazingly well and is FREE.The only reason I'm putting this as a postivie review, is because more people will see it. I bought this game because I enjoyed it on my XBox, however the graphics are horrible and the frame rate is so slow that fighting is almost impossible at points in time. Moving is also horrible out of combat is worse, making the game stutter, and honestly giving me motion sickness.The reason I'm bringing this up is because, recently I bought the Sims4 on Origin. Once I downloaded Origin itself, a notification popped up and Origin litterally gave me this edition of Jade Empire FOR FREE. It runs smooth, in and out of combat.			"

												This game was one of the names from my childhood; in my opinion it is one of the two heights BioWare has reached, those two being this game obviously and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic. This game has graphics that are incredible, they stand testiment even to this day. Though looking very slightly dated, this game was released in 2005 and still looks beautiful even even despite the slightly aged graphics which don't stand in the way. The gameplay is complex and direct. Unlike other RPGs, this is an action RPG with varied styles and enemies to face against to challenge you. The gameplay is always fun regardless of whether its on easy or difficult due to the way the game presents that combat, which never seems to get repetitive.The story is a BioWare classic, one with in-depth characters that are interesting and are actual people rather than tropes on legs. They all have stories and personalities that bring them and the game to life and the main storyline itself is intruiging even though it starts off with a cliché or so it appears. I still play this game to this day despite originally owning it on Xbox and having played it multiple times all ready, I would suggest this game to ANYONE for at least a single playthrough.			"

Short version: 76%Jade Empire is a solid BioWare adventure game with an enjoyable world and storyline, complemented by a frustrating combat system and stripped-down RPG mechanics. It probably won’t be your favourite action game of all time, but you definitely won’t regret playing it.Long version:Jade Empire was created between the releases of two highly successful titles, which later overshadowed its existence, although not without reasons. At its core Jade Empire is nothing more than an attempt to recreate the success of Knights of the Old Republic with a new world based on a highly fictional version of early Imperial China. For the most part, it works well… just don’t expect much historical accuracy, especially on the shoot-em-up stages against the ancient Chinese Luftwaffe. Yes, you read this correctly.An RPG usually is as good as its story, and the game won’t let you down in this regard. The plot is solid with a few good twists, the characters are memorable enough, and the mandatory romance subplot doesn’t feel as forced as in most games. But it’s hard not to notice that most quests are recycled from KotOR and Neverwinter Nights. So, why is Jade Empire so obscure and forgotten? For two reasons. The first is the lack of actual role-playing elements, and the second being the combat system.This was the first title where BioWare tried real-time player-controled action instead of random-based mechanics, and it’s not working too well. Fighting is just mindless button mashing and the hit detection is beyond horrendous; using hand-to-hand styles almost equals a death sentence. As you can imagine, this creates slight issues in a Kung Fu game.Still, Jade Empire is a solid title, and highly recommended for those who like BioWare’s KotOR era. Set the difficulty to easy or medium to avoid the frustration over the combat system, and enjoy this little piece of uniqueness.			"

												This overlooked gem is one of Bioware's most unique and risky RPGs yet.  Made in a style similar Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire is, at its core, a Bioware RPG.  If you've played them before, you should know the formula.  Tutorial, minor thing goes wrong, first mission, even worse thing happens, and then things open  up where you're given multiple objectives at once and it's up to you to decide what order to do things in.  There's a slew of side quests and different party members to drive your progress forward as you make your way from locale to locale to stop the bad guys (TM).In spite of following the basic Bioware formula, there is almost nothing like Jade Empire out there.  It's closer to Mass Effect than KOTOR in that the combat is more active and there's not an abundance of stats.  You level up your character by putting points into health, mana or ""focus"", which is spent to either slow down time or use martial weapons.  Fighting styles level up seperately and are generally made stronger, faster, or cheaper resource-wise.  You can swap styles mid-combat, giving you a number of ways to approach any given combat scenario, though in a realistic scenario you're likely to only have 5 to 6 fully leveled up.  Party members aren't too useful in fights, but you can set them to a passive mode which provides you with buffs or to regenerate one of your stats.  As a result, there's likely one character you'll use most of the game, since you can spend mana to regenerate health as well to fuel your magic powers.Jade Empire's strength comes from its environment and story.  There are relatively few games that exist in an Eastern Asian setting.  It also has one of the most intriguing villians and pulls off a twist almost as good as the first KOTOR.  There are certainly a few flaws in story telling however, the most obvious being the karma system.  Rather than follow a strict good vs evil system, it's more of an order vs chaos meter.  In practice though, most ""chaotic"" choices fall under dumb choices that are nonsensical and hurt people for no reason, which is unfortunate since the main villian definitely follows the ""order"" school of thought but is most certainly a bad guy.  With this karma system poorly thought out, it typically just devolves into good vs bad, and if you're like me, a bad ending just feels like a non-standard game over and tend to be avoided.Overall, I recommend Jade Empire if you like Bioware's formula, but want to try a different setting.  Expect a lot of interaction with NPCs and a slow start, but there's a lot to enjoy.  Expect your fist playthrough to clock in around 20-25 hours.			"

												A sweet action-RPG with some cool martial arts action - combat can be a little repetitive if you exploit certain stun lock combos, but it still stands up as an overall experience pretty well. Story is interesting, will feel right to fans of martial arts films. A fine example of the RPG from BioWare, back before they were owned by EA.			"

												It's not a perfect game: I didn't like the combat system and the PC controls suck, half the game is all about wine, and it, sobs, didn't let me romance Dawn Star with my girl. But it explores spirituality and rebirth in the way that very few games do. The baddies aren't all black, the white is something unattainable, and the plot takes you to places you never expected to go to. It's an exceptional game and I, for one, would totally buy a sequel or two.			"

												""Failed to find Steam"" is a message you might get a lot...or atleast I did on Windows 10. A game I bought, downloaded and started from Steam can't find Steam, right...I wanted to play this game again out of nostalgia since I liked it enought to buy the physical box after I got it digitally and I also played through it twice and got half way during a new game + run. Sadly this game will be buried for me so I can just have my memories of it instead.This just makes me sad. I would have recommended the game, quite highly even since the humour is just awesome at times. Atleast being able to run a game however is still the thing I find most important when buying a game.Just a small edit: I was able to play it quite some time ago on Windows 7, but came across a bug at some point which just made me uninstall it and play it from CD, so the hours I played according to Steam are not right.Another edit: You can play the game by adding Steam to your PATH environment variable and replace JadeEmpireLauncher.exe with JadeEmpire.exe.It does work and I am playing it again, but this is something I really would expect Steam to fix when selling an older game.

												If you want a game with great storytelling and a twisting plot you should definitely play this!I just finished the game for the first time and I really enjoyed it. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this game but it really leaves me impressed. The story felt kinda traditional at first (which isn't bad in any way) but the writers really managed to make the world their own and the characters memorable. And I was also allowed, as the player, to make the story, and the protagonist, my own; every choice I had to make made a difference. As for the gameplay, it was a bit frustrating at times and there were glitches of different kinds, but I just made sure to save often. And I also followed one of the guides here on the Steam Community to make sure the game would run smoothly and it worked out well for me.			"

Look Closely for the Wires [3/5]Those with a taste for Wuxia film will enjoy the authenticity of kicking martial butt through BioWare's rich world of (mostly) traditional Chinese fantasy, but this title is not without it's fair share of problems.Nearly a decade after first release, it would be unrealistic to expect Jade Empire to represent the pinnacle of modern gaming experience; but if you get past the idea that 2005 brought only the meteoric rise of WoW - and a sequel to Battlefield - there is still plenty of entertainment to be had. For the most part, bags of kung-pow action, offbeat one-liners and a colourful cast including John Cleese (yes, that John Cleese) distract from the game's more serious shortcomings; and although far from perfect, the story is strong enough to carry you most of the way with tongue planted firmly in cheek.Combat is the clear focus for much of the title, and while hardcore gamers will probably be disappointed at the simplicity of A-buttoning your opponent(s) to a meaty pulp, there are a number of different fighting styles to switch between that help to keep the beatings somewhat fresh.Taking nothing away from many other reviewers who could not get this title to run at all, somewhat surprisingly, Jade Empire fired up first time on my own modest system (Win7, 32 bit). Aside from one story-halting bug about half way through - fixed with a simple patch in my case - the title ran without hitch. Judging by other reviews however, I'd be wary of purchasing this title for a Windows 8 system.Despite the age of this title, the occasional bug, and it's clunky, badly dated interface, I'd still recommend this to those with a love of Wuxia, or just looking for something a little different.

And I only bother because I kind of like to know the amount of hours I play.Bottom line, get this game somewhere else, cause it's amazing, but can be a hassle through steam.

												Why Bioware never capitalized on this game, I'll never know.Jade Empire is a game that was originally made for the Xbox in 2005, and even now, nearly a decade after realease, it's still a popular, enjoyable, and fantastic video game.Set in a fantastical version of Eastern Asia, you play as a student under the martial arts master, Master Li.

A few hours' search yielded no solution that worked for me (latest graphics drivers, compatibility modes, .ini edits, ad nauseum).It's old enough that the devs (Bioware) don't care, the publishers (2k Games/EA) don't care, and the distributors (Steam) don't care.The copy I bought from gog.com, though, works just fine.  They go out of their way to make sure the older games they sell work on modern systems.  Go there; avoid it here.			"

												This is hands down the single best game Bioware has ever made. Even above Mass Effect 1 for me. My only regret for it is that Bioware did not move development over to the Xbox 360 during development (which was on the table,) since it was lost in the shuffle from one generation to the other.That aside, this game is just a joy to play. It being an action RPG, especially after all those years of more turn based, segmented fare from their studio, was such a joy to experience when I first played it. The fighting system is varied, there are several avenues to suceed, all of them entertaining. It is for this reason that, though the system can be abused, it just adds to the charm. In every moment, in every piece of it, you can see a real love for this property. It being Bioware's first in house IP is a large part of that, but it is also the source material. It turns out that the folks over at Bioware are big Wuxia fans, and if you aren't by the end of this game, you may not have a heart.My favorite element of the game though, is the morality system (though I will admit it is more of a de jure love than de facto.) Where in Knights of the Old Republic you have Dark Side and Light Side choices, in Jade Empire, you have the Way of the Open Palm and the Way of the Closed Fist. The best way to describe the difference is for me to say that one is a personal choice, but the other is a personal philosophy - either path can be misrepresented, and there are no right answers. At least, in theory. In practice, having come right off of Kotor, and being originally for the OG Xbox, concessions had to be made. As it is practiced by the player, it too often comes across as little more than the Dark/Light Side heavy handed choices. This just serves to make those occasions where it does work extra special, and they really shine. I don't know whether it was a hardware or design limitation. If Bioware ever does make a Jade Empire 2 which could realize the system as it is described is as exciting an idea as I can imagine.Alas, it was lost in the shuffle for better hardware, and though it is made by one of the most famous developers in the business right after one of their biggest hits and right before their biggest hit, there are seemingly few who have played or even heard of Jade Empire. That is the biggest shame of all. I exhort all who are on the fence to buy this game immediately (also, play with a gamepad. It works brilliantly.) You won't be sorry. "

												Okay, I really like this game.  But it doesn't work right from the install.  You need to run notepad as an administrator, create a file called ""SystemInformation.xml"" with it in the data folder of the Jade Empire game, then set the game to run in compatibility mode for XP service pack 2.  Pain in the rear, and there's no real support from the original publishers.  But it was worth it, and I got it on sale.			"

												I decided to play Jade Empire after having played the KOTOR games multiple times, Mass Effect 2 and 3, and Dragon Age: Origins. I was on a BioWare binge, and needed more of what made those games so special. In short, Jade Empire is a decent game, but a relatively weak effort from a company that has done so much better.Graphics: The graphics are a highlight of the game, even if somewhat dated today. The worlds are rich and colorful, the game has its own unique art style, and it's fun to see the different special powers and items in play.Level design: For those of you familiar with KOTOR, the level design will remind you at times of certain worlds in that series. BioWare is very good at creating an atmosphere or ""feel"" with their level designs and this is no exception. However, there aren't all that many worlds to explore in comparison to BioWare's other games. KOTOR II, which was released a year before this game, contained over 7-8 different worlds, not including shorter stages. Jade Empire barely has 5, and not even the supposedly grand Imperial City is quite as large or expansive as Nar Shaddaa. (It comes across as more of a small village than anything.) I could compare it to watching an older Hollywood film - one can often tell that the sets are as large as the view of the camera; one step to the right and you're in a studio. Similarly, the limited nature of some of these areas makes them feel less authentic.Sound: The music is enjoyable enough and fits the artistic theme of the game. However, it is mostly forgettable, with one notable exception - the Imperial Palace theme (""Anthem of a Tyrant""), which invokes a bit of a Darth Vader or Don Fanucci vibe. The voice acting is decent (albeit a little cartoony at times), and I had no complaints about the sound effects.Story and characters: I did not find either the story or the characters particularly original or compelling. However, that is not to say that there are no highlights; Hou has some smirk-worthy moments as a repressed husband and Silk Fox leads an interesting dual life. But other characters are defined by single traits: Dawn Star, for instance, is the generic good-hearted heroine with no flaws, and the Black Whirlwind is drunk and roguish. Things get especially cringe-inducing when the game tries to shoehorn a backstory into the latter. Unlike Dragon Age, which contains multi-layered characters, or Mass Effect, which explores personal changes through the game's arc, the characters here are fairly static and uninteresting.Plot-wise, the game borrows a critical element from KOTOR II without coming up with many creative plot ideas, so hardcore BioWare fans won't be too thrilled with the game's writing. Unfortunately, hardcore BioWare fans are the group most likely to try this game.Gameplay: The gameplay heavily revolves around combat, which heavily revolves around melee attacks, which heavily revolve around incessant clicking of the mouse. There are moments when strategy is involved, usually when facing off against multiple strong enemies. In addition, the PC can learn a couple of ranged attacks and possess weapons, but the selection is disappointingly limited and you'll find yourself resorting to the same two or three fighting styles over and over. Not to mention, almost every conflict in the game is resolved through combat, which grows tiresome. The enemies often take twenty hits to go down, which tests not one's skills but one's patience. Furthermore, some levels contain dozens of battles with groups of the same kind of enemy (often respawning!). However, there are a few battles in the game that require more creativity to fight, and although they do not dominate most of the game's combat, brawling with these foes can be very enjoyable.I think that the game in general relied too much on combat, while devoting little attention to gameplay through dialogue/choices, strategy, etc. In addition, the combat itself was not varied enough for me to forego this issue - I found myself terribly bored throughout the third act in the game, simply tolerating each battle just to get to the end.The game does implement an alignment system, but it seems to matter a lot less than in other BioWare titles. At the end of the day, combat is Jade Empire's main feature, and it's not as fun as one might expect or hope.Final verdict: 6/10 - The combat is often repetitive, some characters are flat, and the game feels disappointingly short and lacking in an engaging plot. However, despite these flaws, there are some well-designed environments, and the originality of the artwork and setting is a strong point. If there's a Jade Empire 2, BioWare needs to recognize this one's limitations. Jade Empire had the potential to be a great title, but given the drawbacks outlined above, I can only call it decent. I would recommend it to dedicated BioWare fans, but not really anyone else.Oh, and the flyer levels - really, Bioware? You thought it was a good idea to implement scrolling shooter stages?			"

												I loved this game when I played it on the original Xbox. Now I can't imagine why. It has possibly the worst combat and camera controls of any game I've ever played. During combat, some button presses are often delayed by a few seconds. If you begin a combo and then try to dodge, it will complete the combo before dodging. Often so much time has passed between when you press the dodge button and when you actually dodge that you may no longer want to dodge. But you will. Oh yes, you will. The same goes for if any enemy is hitting you. You will wait for the enemy to finish THEIR combo before you dodge/attack. Basically, the combat is very stilted and unresponsive. The camera is perhaps even worse. It's understandable given the age of the game and the hardware it was developed on that the camera would be somewhat limited. You can only tilt the camera up, not down, and the camera movement is very imprecise. That's all forgiveable. What is not forgiveable is how the camera behaves in combat. If you are fighting near a wall the camera will tilt at odd angles preventing you from seeing what is going on. This becomes especially annoying when you are fighting in a small room. You may be fighting blind 75% of the time.There are other issues with the game, as well, such as the invisible barriers that surround you during battles, the stilted dialogue, the overly simplistic RPG elements (there are only three attributes), and the fuzzy cutscenes.I just can't recommend this game, which is a pity. I really did love it on Xbox. Kind of makes me question the judgment of past me.			"

												This, together with ""Zelda: Ocarina of Time"" and ""Vampire: Bloodlines"" is one of my favorite games of all times.Strange mix, I know, but the thing connecting them is great storytelling.The world is very charming, inspired by chinese fairy tales and wisdom. With the ways of the Open Palm and the Closed Fist it has some interesting philosophies built into it and tries not to fall into the good/evil trap. I think this was very successful. the philosophies seemed a little bit over the top, but all in all believable (and for something that was made up for a single video game this is a lot).The graphics have aged well and are nice to look at (I mean yeah, the number of NPCs walking around is very low and thus the same model repeats).I loved the combat system. It is a mix between RPG (acquiring and levelling skills) and Beat 'em up games. I found this very intriguing. In fights you can switch between different styles and each style has several different attacks. You can transform into all kinds of creatures to gain their skills. You can use weapon styles for massive damage, but using up your focus (which you can also use to slow down time). You can use your Chi and magic styles for different styles of spellcasting (but you can also use your Chi for healing or empowering your strikes).And there are several support styles allowing you, for example, stuns or stealing enemie's Chi.It is fairly easy to abuse. As soon as you have access to a few key styles you can win every combat with just those.But it is still fun. You still have to position yourself and to wait for the right moment to strike.And even though this game is mostly linear (linear main plot with plenty of optional side quests) I do love playing this game again and again (my playtime here is not correct, I used to have a non steam version before). It really managed to give you a sense of wonder and immerse into this world. You will meet fox spirits and cannibals, demons and golems. And you have a big group of followers, all with (somewhat) complex relationships and their own motivations.So I would completely suggest trying out this game (but I think it might be free on other platforms).I haven't tried it on Win10 yet, but on WIn7 I could get it to run with a few things changed (you can find them in the community hub, it is not to much effort).

												The controls and lack of proper tutorial mean that you'll be dying and not understanding why. I have tried this with both a controller and keyboard. The controller support was clearly an afterthought and even though dual analog joysticks on the PC existed at the time, the controller did not operate well and simply acted as if the buttons were badly mapped from a keyboard with no analog support. Maybe the Xbox version is good, this version is not.			"

That's what I love about this game, great challenge, and great story. What more could you ask! The battle system is fun to fiddle around with, though it was not readily apparent for me to press both light and heavy attack to make an AOE attack which is great for controlling mobs.

												I've played through this game about 3 or 4 times and I say get it and play it if you haven't and you like Bioware or RPGs in general. This is a fantastic game to start out with if you're new to Bioware. It's a new world with a great combat system. Fantastic story and AMAZING combat system. Unfortunately the combat system is very easily breakable (I won't say how) with the ability to stun lock whole groups of enemies (and even the final boss) and just get a load of free hits. You will NOT take damage after a certain point if you get the ""right"" skills.Yeah this review is short because all I can say is get it, the game is great but the combat is a bit exploitable. Buy the game, go exploit it and have fun your first time thru feeling like a kung fu god! Then man up and try it for real tee hee			"

												Jade Empire is a hidden gem in BioWare's product line. It contains the standard BioWare flourishes: romanceable companions with their own storylines, a breathtaking plot, an alignment system (of sorts). Unlike the Baldur's Gate series or Knights of the Old Republic, this game didn't catch on as strongly (probably to do in part with the Eastern theme). There are even a few twists that you might not expect.Two of the possible romance targets don't care about your gender. While some think this to be the first step to BioWare's inclusiveness in that regard, Knights of the Old Republic came out two years earlier and had Juhani, who was only interested in female PCs...

												I am so glad this game came out on steam!  I have been a fan of bioware games since KotoR.  I bought this on x-box when it first came out and every now and then I break out my old xbox to play.  Now I won't have to do that and to be honest my old xbox is running on it's last leg.  I haven't played much of the game since getting it on steam but it is pretty much the same.  The special edition does offer at lease one new character if my memory is right because I don't remember monk zeng from the original.  The graphics seem to have gotten a bit of an upgrade too.  When it first came out I have no idea if it was on pc or not but the graphics are 100x better than what they were on xbox. Noww all that said I do have to say I do agree with other reviews that the game is technically ""broken"" and should be fixed if steam is going to continue to sell it.  But the broken feature is really easy to fix.  I ran into two problems when trying to play.  First the game kept telling me it couldn't find steam.  This was an easy fix by copying the steam.dll file in the steam folder and pasting a copy in the Jade Empire folder.  After that the game still crashed on start up.  So I had to rename the launcher as JadeEmpire_BACKUP and rename another .exe file as JadeEmpireLauncher.  It wasn't hard at all and the istructions I found online were much more helpful than this review.  While it was a minor inconvenience it isn't enough to stop anyone from getting this game.  Totally worth it to play one of the best games bioware has put out!			"

												It's the prequel to Mass Effect... Ok that's not technically true, but it is made by Bioware and it did come out before the Mass Effect series. The play styles are very similar, except instead of guns you use your fists, melee weapons, and magic. Did I mention it has an excellent story? It has an excellent story.All that being said, it's easily the best Action-RPG that came out on the original Xbox.			"

												I really enjoyed the story in this game. It is very linear and the RPG elements are streamlined but this works well given the story driven nature. The combat is fun but the character development in terms of combat abilities took a while to ramp up so that you had more options to keep it fresh. The voice acting is consistently good. I took the path of the Open Palm (good guy) but there is probably some good replayability here with another run through at some point going with Closed Fist. I don't think this would change the story dramatically but it would make a replay interesting by varying quests from the first time through. On the whole, I'd enthusiastically recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story in an RPG and is okay with traditional RPG elements being on the light side. I really had a very good time with this. The ending was excellent but I won't talk about the story at all so as not to spoil anything.			"

												Utterly loved this game on my Xbox but never got around to finishing it. When I saw the game was available on Steam AND on sale I just had to pick it up again. The graphics are a bit dated, non-combat animations are a bit clunky, and the combat is far from complex (you'll quickly find a few styles you prefer and use over anything else and there's no incentive to swap between different styles of the same type) but it had nostalgic appeal for me. It's not necessarily difficult but it is a fairly deep RPG. On a minor playability note, the game IS controller compatible but I highly recommend sticking with the keyboard if only for the style swapping simplicity (assuming you don't just play with the same overpowered style your whole runthrough).

												I like this game, a great deal. What frustrated me about the Xbox version is that, if you play it on the 360, you need to be connected to Xbox Live to get the extra stuff from the Limited Edition version. So I decided to get it on Steam, hoping I would be able to use the monk spade weapon style, and was thoroughly disappointed when I found out that while you can play as Monk Zeng, you cannot get Tien's Justice. This really needs to be rectified. Although the port is broken and cannot start up, it's not a difficult fix at all, but it's still a glaring issue. Overall though, this game is great and the fact that the port needs a bit of tweaking to make it work doesn't really detract from that in my eyes. Would still recommend, easily an 8/10.			"

Product received for free
												i did my first playthrough on the first xbox. i finished the game and also played a bit of the special edition before i had this steam accound. and i recently got this game on steam (as a  gift). so nvm the 6 hours on record.this is a fantastic game. remember when bioware was the go to company for deep, epic rpgs? jade empire is a classic in my opinion.it has a beautiful setting. inspired by chinese culture and folklore. sure the game is fairly old now and it showes but because of the artstyle this game still looks great to me. it has interesting npcs, party interaction (friendships, romances, fights), multiple endings, choice and consequence, great amosphere, dialogue trees that are actually dialogue trees and an interesting main plot. sure the combat isnt the greatest. i mean it isnt bad but it isnt superb either. i have fun with it. (still better than witcher 1's combat system or Assasins Creeds etc)sometimes you think fights are too easy when you progress further in the game.and of course there is the *mainproblem*the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. and yes its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port.but it can be fixed with not much effort.so youll get rid of the stutters, get rid of  the damn framescap and you can tweak a lot of other stuff.dont know about the mouse and keyboard controls (i dont imagine its unplayable. in fact ive read online it actually controls quite well) but the steam controller works like a charm. (i might had to start steam as an admin tho) i dont remember what fix i used but this is about it i think..


How to fix poor performance/stuttering in Jade Empire 
A Guide for Jade Empire: Special Edition
By: Vapor Gator

			Bought this classic RPG and are disappointed with how it performs on your more than competent rig? Here's a very simple solution that should get Jade Empire playing smooth as silk!		


anyways it can be fixed. what youre left with in the end is just a great kinda ""old school"" bioware rpg. with all the qualities that a bioware game came with back in the day. (not saying they completely suck now but ya know...)so do i recommend it? absolutely! even at the full price of 15 bucks. hardly a difficult sell imo. and if you can get it on sale.. well what are you waiting for then?oh btw.. its not really that important (or important at all) but john cleese has a cameo appearance.oh and there are mods.. never used any. im downloading ""in style"" right nowhttp://jade-empire-in-style.com/ (seems buggy and abandoned by now so maybe you should just play vanilla)also if you get the ""failed to find steam bug""https://steamcommunity.com/app/7110/discussions/0/611696927911255467/some users might get a black screen when they exit the game. this is due to the windows 10 anniversary update. i have the same problem with the first witcher game. alt tabbing solution works for me. so alt tab and close the window that way.

												Jade Empire is an action roleplaying game which puts you in the role of a young martial artist on a quest to free his/her master from the grasp of the sinister order of the Lotus Assassins while slowly discovering the history and the machinations behind the titular Jade Empire. The game heavily borrows from the Chinese tradition and mythical lore for its setting and characters.The main beef of the gameplay are the martial style you can use in combat: some of them are about using a weapon like a sword or a staff, others allow you to cast spells or incapacitate your enemies. You can equip four of them at a time and learn to use them in tandem, manage their mana cost (or better said, chi or focus cost depending on the style used) and upgrade their stats carefully. Enemies respond differently to the various style, forcing you to switch between them during each battle. Other novelities from Jade Empire, gameplay-wise, are about the techniques, permanent stats bonus you can collect for your character from quests, and gems, which provide some bonuses when equipped.Jade Empire remains a classic BioWare videogame at its core, with plenty of companions you'll learn to know better during your journey, interesting secondary characters and a pletore of either funny or interesting sidequests. There is even a karma meter (which judges your action through a ""good"" and ""evil"" scheme of some sort) and the possibility to change the later story drastically depending on your allignment and previous choices. In the end, you can even romance a character of your choice.It's worth mentioning however that Jade Empire is somehow scarce when it comes to explorable locations and, at least on normal difficulty, the game can become rather easy really quickly (namely, some styles are very unbalanced and, generally, using a stunning style in tandem with an heavy damaging one is sure to make most enemies encounter a breeze).The Special Edition of Jade Empire adss content that once belonged only to the Xbox version and its collector's edition. Also, starting up this Steam version could require some workaround.All in all, Jade Empire is a classic RPG from the golden age of BioWare: you should totally buy it if you enjoy the other games made by this studio, but be also warned that not everyone could find the Eastern theme going in Jade Empire that appealing			"

												I always heard this game was good, but I never tried it until recently. I was very pleasantly surprised, way better than I though it was going to be. If you liked Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and/or ancient Chinese culture, this is right up you alley. My two gripes are:  - The combat system feels a little clunky, likely due to it's age, but it is managable. - The auto save system doesn't save nearly enough. Sometimes you will get swarmed with enemies and die in about 3-5 seconds, but then the game will send you back like 20 minutes! I found myself saying ""You gotta be kidding me, all the way back here?!"" More than once.			"

												Okay so final thoughts on the game. It still has that compatibility bug that requires downloading a patch launcher and config.exe that is available in the forums but the game itself is enjoyable. The special edition adds only minor things  compared to the original (mostly graphical and AI improvements but also some style upgrades and a new higher difficulty) which is disappointing as it still means the main quest and all side quests can be finished in under 20 hours.Combat is fun and smooth though the transformation styles are still incredibly OP when maxed out and the martial styles can feel weak late game unless you use chi attacks. There are occassional graphical errors and they can require reloading the game, going into another area, or going into combat to fix. The amount of lore explored in the game is impressive and some of it will play a major role in the main story.Going down the Closed Fist path can lead the player on a much darker course than the Dark Side from their previous game KoToR but the game does suffer from the fact that a major choice made at the end will decide whether you get the Open Palm or Closed Fist ending (props to Bioware for a 3rd choice to let the antagonist win) no matter your 'alignment' before this choice, though there are multiple endings for the party NPCs. There is good characterization and interaction with and between the party's NPCs and a late game choice can add a serious twist to your relationship with them. I'd say Bioware built upon this in their development of their next game Mass Effect.Overall an excellent game, if a bit short, and a recommended one if you don't have it or have never played it before. Why a sequel has never been produced is baffling though likely due to Bioware focusing so heavily on the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, and on Star Wars: The Old Republic.			"

												What do you get when you take Knights of the Old Republic and put it in a (pseudo-)Asian setting? This game. A classic tale of a Hero, The Chosen One, who collects his band of companions on the way to defeat the Bad Guy. Your dialog choices follow either the Way of the Open Palm (selfless aspects of the Light side) or the Way of the Closed Fist (evolutionist aspects of the Dark side). If you loved KotOR (not many among those who played it didn't), you will love this game too. The cool, unexpected twist is that this is a martial arts RPG. It didn't get that much spotlight, though, probably because its release date clashed with some of the more famous titles in the category. Or perhaps because it is too short for a Bioware RPG, who knows. Definitely a must-play for all true Bioware fans.			"

The choices you can make are some of the most expansive I have ever seen in a game, and some of the twists in the story are really surprising the first time you experience them!There were some hitches getting the game to work on PC, so my only real complaint would be the support section on this game, namely a single correct guide on how to get the game to run in a modern OS, I had to read through many posts to piece together how to get the game working on my system..

												I really enjoyed this game on the xbox and so when it went on a 75% sale a few weeks ago I grabbed it. The good:This is one of the best martial arts themed RPGs I've ever played. The action in the fights is smooth and the controls are easy to pick up, but take some time to master. I really liked the feel of this game. The world wsa just fun to learn about.The graphics are still pretty good even though the game is almost 7 years old. The bad:The game is curently  broken for windows 7/8 users. There are a number of work arounds and fixes posted in the forms. I found that renaming some files and running steam in administrator mode fixed it for me.Bottom line:If you like RPGs and this game is ever on a good (50% and up) sale, then pick this game up. Hopefully Steam can fix the issues with the install so that it will play on newer systems, but you can get it working with a little patience and I think it is well worth the work.			"

												Jade Empire is one the best games on the original Xbox. Unfortunately, the PC port is terrible.The user interface is low-resolution and looks absolutely horrendous, the controls are poorly translated for the mouse & keyboard but even if you attach a gamepad it doesn't work as it did on the original Xbox. Instead they have modified the control scheme to be more like a first-person shooter despite the fact that you never need to aim in this game.If you're in it for the story, the game is a fantastic journey. That said, be prepared for terrible controls and technical issues across the board. This is a terrible port of an excellent game.			"

												Good game!Pros:+ story, I enjoyed the concepts, the growth of your character, the supporters that tag along background and side quests;+ Various game play styles, fast or slow, magic or weapons, mix them, different characters;+ male and female protagonists;+ some romance, it was weak, but I count as a + because it has it;It worth the bucks on it.Middle: graphics and experience points are good for the release date, keep in mind that this is a 7 years old game at the time of this review.Cons:- enemies die no matter the style you use, so it gets repetitive if you don't change the styles or cast a magic, everyone dies with one style or other, so if you just use one and click a lot you win 90% of the time. Perhaps in hard or other level the game gets more balanced, but I played on normal dificulty level.I hope you lik the review.			"

												With a great story, tons of missions, beautifully rich settings, satisfying fighting and brilliant characterisation Jade Empire has transcended its Xbox roots to reincarnate itself as an epic RPG for PC. Not to mention it translates remarkably well to keyboard control.Few games in the genre tell a story this well, and fewer still combine that intriguing tale with such absolutely superb game mechanics. Jade Empire offers excellent drama in fresh, new settings. Hopefully, the unwashed masses will come to understand its greatness.			"

												This is a fantastic game that remains playable to this day, despite having been in the market for years. Don't let the dated graphics fool you, the engaging story and solid gameplay still provides a really good experience to enjoy. While I wouldn't say that this is Bioware's best game(that honor belongs to KotOR and DA:O), it is definitely one of it's better games. This little gem is definitely worth the price that I paid for!

												I really enjoyed the setting and atmosphere of Jade Empire; the game takes place in a fantasy land based on the Orient. The characters are fairly engaging and there's some good development there, with some nice branching the player can choose. Not quite as deep as Mass Effect, but good nonetheless. Voice acting was well-done and the story itself proved satsifying.However, the graphics are a bit dated and the combat itself a tad underwhelming. Fighting was too easy and once you grasp the fairly basic system there's really no way you should ever die even though I played the game with a controller (configuring the controls were a bit of a minor inconvenience in the beginning)Overall a good game, 8/10, and certainly deserves a sequel. I definitely recommend buying the game if it's on sale, 15$ is asking a little too much given the age of the game.			"

												""Everything begins with choice."" -MorpheusJade empire is another great that time forgot. Lacking the major franchise tie-in of the Knights of the Old Republic series (or duo) and the triple-A investments of the Mass Effect series, this Bioware RPG is, imo, an underrated almost-masterpiece of a game.As to the bad news: Getting this console port running on Steam and modern Windows machines ain't like dusting crops. A true PC gamer distinguishes himself from his console rivals by his literacy; he reads the forums (no, reads, READS the forums, you idiot, not reposts the same question that's been answered a million times, thus♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the veterans who could help if they thought you would/could actually read their response), finds the solution, and implements it, like a big boy. That's what you're going to have to do for Jade Empire, and it's probably a fair price. The great thing about Jade Empire is the great thing about Knights of the Old Republic: You, the player, form your character. I'm not talking about a customization screen at the start of the game, or even stats and skills (Jade Empire actually falls short on these compared to Knights of the Old Republic, with its ""streamlined"" system), but the combination of the morality system with the diversity of fighting styles. There are weapon styles, martial arts, nuker magic arts, transformation styles(!), and a remarkable collection of creative ""support"" styles (things like mana draining strikes, various disorients, slows, DOTS, etc.). A large variety can be known, and you can transition between them on the fly, setting up the game's ""harmonic combo"" finishing moves or unleashing your own improvisational strategies. And Bioware didn't lay these arts out as a menu for you to wearily pick through; many of them are made available through questing or optional discoveries, or like the transformation styles, by defeating particular enemies. One of the best parts of the game, or any game, is an episode in the Emperial City, where you face down a foreigner by the name of Sir Roderick Von Fontlebottom, the Magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, voiced by John Cleese(!). After defeating him in a series of trials of wits and martial skill (if you can, the man's obviously your superior) one of the available rewards is Mirabelle, his muzzle-loading blunderbuss, as a weapon style. You can thenceforward barge through the game's normally-fluid martial arts combat, blasting first like a Harrison Ford character.Mirabelle isn't a ""necessary"" skill to get you through late game; there's no such thing as a critical path of skill development. Which means you just take what's awesome. And there's lots and lots of awesome. There's the secret perk of the maxed-out double axes. There's the stunning power of White Demon martial style. There's the crazy OP speed of focus mode. There's the mighty disables of Storm Dragon. There's Red Minister transformation style, with crazy vampiric healing. You can get ALL of these, map whichever you want (up to 4 within easy reach) and then put upgrade points into your favorites without forgoing the others. Because styles provide benefits aside from raw damage, you're not confined late-game to your most upgraded techniques. They're your big guns, but even without upgrades you can still make practical and clever use of a wide variety of styles right up til the last fight. That's just good game design right there.And then there's the writing. When Bioware's on, they're on. And this game is a top-shelf balance of drama and humor, one that is in my opinion, still unmatched. One of the major achievements is the integration of the morality system and your plot choices into your relationships with your many followers; that's about all I'll say about that. I'd just cheapen it with many words.I could really go on and on; dat morality system! Dat follower! Dat other follower! LOL Black Whirlwind! FML Death's Hand! John Cleese! Nathan Fillion! LOL Kang the Mad! Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the part with the inn! LOL come at me 50 foot tall golem! I don't even know how to tell you how my mind was blown when I played this game on the original XBox, before modern graphics jaded my eyes. For those who were lucky enough to enjoy Jade Empire back when 5 character models for an entire game didn't bother you, or for those who can project back to those days and enjoy a game on the basis of its storytelling, creativity, and humor, Jade Empire is a true treasure. Put it on your wish list and grab it on sale.			"

												Jade Empire takes place in a mysterious and ancient empire inspired by East-asian cultures.The game itself is a story-driven RPG which lets the player travel around the land with companions which you can converse with and learn all manner of back story and interesting knowledges from, while the story and and character development is just like most classical BioWare games, the gameplay itself is really funny, its real-time action kung fu with many different styles and with several mods the game's already deep combat system gets even better.The combat feels extremely satisfying as you can do everything from kung-fu moves, shoot bolts of fire out of your, turn yourself into a demon or pick up a sword to slice your enemies to pieces.Honestly, the only complaint I have is that the game isn't longer, a veteran can easily finish this game in one-sitting in about 6-9 hours, but for a first timer its easily 25h+ if you stay relatively focused on the main quest.Music & Sound: 10/10Environment: 8/10Graphics: 6/10Character Development: 8/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10			"

												I purchased this game awhile back. Played through it and beat it. Came back and wanted to play it again because as an RPG game it offers a lot of diversity and ways of playing through the story with much dialog and quests.However, the game 'failed to find steam' and will no longer run on my system. I spent hours upon hours trying to find an answer to this and eventually found a 'hot fix' in which I have to modify some of the game's files.I should not have to do that though. This game is 'broken' and until it gets an official patch I would recommend staying far far away from this title and possibly all Bioware titles.The game is worth $0.00 in its current state. "

 Highlights +* Fun, memorable characters+* Great, rich story with a decent twist+* Plenty of ways to build a character Positives + Engaging combat+ Nice choice system  Negatives - Limited character stats ( only health, chi & focus ) - Some ardous, cheap fights ( elephant demons and demons in general )- Could of been more locations to visit- Followers seemed a little underwhelming in a fight  Concerns -* I encountered a few glitches like the camera constantly facing downwards towards the ground which was luckily enough rectified by loading the save file again. -* As much as I loved the paralysing palm technique, it was quite overpowered as you could essentially stun lock your enemies.  Consensus Jade Empire is a classic example of how Bioware crafts a story driven game with memorable characters that accompany you along the way. Despite the downsides, I thoroughly enjoyed Jade Empire and it was a pleasure to witness Bioware trying something fresh, I mean how many Western RPG developers have made a game that is centred in Asia? 7/10  "

												I was incredibly disappointed in this game. I'm a huge fan of everything Bioware, but this is just plain awful. The story is good, along with the writing and voice acting, but the gameplay feels like pre-street fighter 1 levels of terrible, unrefined ""action"" combat. It's like whoever designed this game had never heard the phrase ""button mash"" or ""stun lock"". Which is fine for every other Bioware RPG, but not one that for a game with a fighting game style combat system. Combine that with an atrocious PC port with controls that fight you at every turn and visuals that, while good looking, are inconsistent (certain prompts and information would simply disappear during combat some of the time) and buggy, and you get a heaping pile of crap that Bioware deserves more♥♥♥♥♥♥for than Mass Effect 3's ending. I stopped playing this game half way through and uninstalled it.			"

Posted: December 9, 2015
												This is a borderline positive recommendation, for a number of reasons.The story as a whole is good, but dissapointing. It is a very predictable story. You are a student to a great, but unknown master with a dark past that wants to keep you safe until the hand of destiny itself sets you on a path to restore balance in the empire. There is a twist that feels telegraphed and a bit of mystery surrounding one of the characters that gives itself away before you're even two hourse in, if you're paying attention. It is short, but in this case it's a good thing, as the story is so generic it would feel like wading through a pool of undried cement. At just about 25 hours, give or take, it paces itself rather well and is coherent, but for a game with conversation options, it's extremely linear, especially once you enter the fortress. The biggest let down is the conversations. Each conversation you are given a number of lines you can choose which amount to nothing unless it's an obvious good vs. evil type of choice. Each character you speak to reacts almost the same way and says the same things regardless of your answer, with some exceptions with the three romance options (two per gender). Also, every important character that you encounter more often than once will repeat themselves almost endlessly. In one conversation I had with the Water Dragon, she told me the same thing no less than seven times, to the detriment of my already dying brain. The combat is, well, annoying.

Your attacks have this bothersome ability of knocking back the enemy you are attacking just out of reach of your next attack, unless you pin them to the edge of the fight zone. Fast styles are almost hands down superior to any slower style because each attack interrupts your enemy (unless they are a massive enemy like the toad or elephant demons or the jade golems). The mechanics of each enemy, while interesting at first become a nuisance the further you go into the story, especially ghosts.There is one mini game (thankfully) in the game, but I won't go into it as you can effectively skip all of it unless you want to finish a character's quest line. The other ones are useless, or next to.The redeeming quality is the game's companion characters. For a short game they are rather one dimensional but interesting enough to last you the first half of the game after which you won't get anything more than remarks out of them, with the exception of your romance option. They will comment as you adventure and then when you all group up again will act like they were just then hearing about what was happening for the first time. However, they are colorful and fit very well within their one dimension, fleshing it out very well. I understand that the review seems rather negative, but I rather enjoyed the game, with some glaring exceptions. Jade Empire is akin to that somewhat annoying dinner guest, who is pleasant enough company but you can't quite wait for them to leave, as much as you might wish to feel otherwise.Overall this is a game that, in my opinion, desperately needs a sequel to redeem itself. I recommend it, but only barely. If you are looking to play an action game with a modicum of morality and interaction, this would fit quite well, but if you are looking for an actual rpg, this would not fit that bill			"

Steam/Bioware really should fix it for us, I can get people not recommending the game for that reason, but c'mon.  The game is amazing and the fix is incredibly simple to do yourself.  (To find the fix, just check the Jade Empire community page.  A few people have posted different methods)			"

												I have heard wonderful things about this game. Unfortunately, as you apparently need to hack into the game files in order to even attempt to play, I have experienced very few of them.While occassionally people have had no problems with getting this game to run and play without critical error, many many people have not, myself included. I want to play this game. But having to mess around with renaming files and such and still being unable to progress has really killed my enthusiasm. Buyers beware if you want this game for anything other than a crash course in debugging. It can be hard to get to the actual playing part.			"

												I was incredibly disappointed in this game. I'm a huge fan of everything Bioware, but this is just plain awful. The story is good, along with the writing and voice acting, but the gameplay feels like pre-street fighter 1 levels of terrible, unrefined ""action"" combat. It's like whoever designed this game had never heard the phrase ""button mash"" or ""stun lock"". Which is fine for every other Bioware RPG, but not one that for a game with a fighting game style combat system. Combine that with an atrocious PC port with controls that fight you at every turn and visuals that, while good looking, are inconsistent (certain prompts and information would simply disappear during combat some of the time) and buggy, and you get a heaping pile of crap that Bioware deserves more♥♥♥♥♥♥for than Mass Effect 3's ending. I stopped playing this game half way through and uninstalled it.			"

												This was such a great game when it first came out. I really enjoyed playing through it a few times so I could go back and choose the things that I didn't the first time. Lot of fun. That being said, this steam version of the game will not run on my pc. I have tried all the hot fixes I could find on the forums and still the game wont run past the launcher. If a game is being sold on Steam I feel it should be able to run without me having to change a bunch of settings and other crap. Although I do like this game, I don't recommend purchasing it here.btw, I had to leave the launcher open just so I could write this review.			"

Posted: December 9, 2015
												This is a borderline positive recommendation, for a number of reasons.The story as a whole is good, but dissapointing. It is a very predictable story. You are a student to a great, but unknown master with a dark past that wants to keep you safe until the hand of destiny itself sets you on a path to restore balance in the empire. There is a twist that feels telegraphed and a bit of mystery surrounding one of the characters that gives itself away before you're even two hourse in, if you're paying attention. It is short, but in this case it's a good thing, as the story is so generic it would feel like wading through a pool of undried cement. At just about 25 hours, give or take, it paces itself rather well and is coherent, but for a game with conversation options, it's extremely linear, especially once you enter the fortress. The biggest let down is the conversations. Each conversation you are given a number of lines you can choose which amount to nothing unless it's an obvious good vs. evil type of choice. Each character you speak to reacts almost the same way and says the same things regardless of your answer, with some exceptions with the three romance options (two per gender). Also, every important character that you encounter more often than once will repeat themselves almost endlessly. In one conversation I had with the Water Dragon, she told me the same thing no less than seven times, to the detriment of my already dying brain. The combat is, well, annoying. On one hand it's dynamic, keeping you involved in every fight, which is a good thing. On the other hand it's repetitive and even outright annoying. Your attacks have this bothersome ability of knocking back the enemy you are attacking just out of reach of your next attack, unless you pin them to the edge of the fight zone. Fast styles are almost hands down superior to any slower style because each attack interrupts your enemy (unless they are a massive enemy like the toad or elephant demons or the jade golems). The mechanics of each enemy, while interesting at first become a nuisance the further you go into the story, especially ghosts.There is one mini game (thankfully) in the game, but I won't go into it as you can effectively skip all of it unless you want to finish a character's quest line. The other ones are useless, or next to.The redeeming quality is the game's companion characters. For a short game they are rather one dimensional but interesting enough to last you the first half of the game after which you won't get anything more than remarks out of them, with the exception of your romance option. They will comment as you adventure and then when you all group up again will act like they were just then hearing about what was happening for the first time. However, they are colorful and fit very well within their one dimension, fleshing it out very well. I understand that the review seems rather negative, but I rather enjoyed the game, with some glaring exceptions. Jade Empire is akin to that somewhat annoying dinner guest, who is pleasant enough company but you can't quite wait for them to leave, as much as you might wish to feel otherwise.Overall this is a game that, in my opinion, desperately needs a sequel to redeem itself. I recommend it, but only barely. If you are looking to play an action game with a modicum of morality and interaction, this would fit quite well, but if you are looking for an actual rpg, this would not fit that bill			"

												The game itself, I heartily recommend. Just don't play this port.First off, you can't play it unless you're running Steam as an administrator. Which wouldn't be that bad, if not for the fact that /I literally cannot continue playing due to a bug/.I completed over half the game, then BAM. In order to finish a quest, I need to fight someone (as it usually goes in the Jade Empire). The moment combat starts, however, the map /breaks/, and it becomes literally impossible to win the fight (it also becomes impossible to lose the fight, on that note).This is a great game, but I can't recommend it on Steam. Do yourself a favor, and don't buy this. You'll be saving yourself the frustration.			"

												Jade Empire is Bioware's most forgetable RPG.  That doesn't make it bad, but there is a reason the developer turned Mass Effect and Dragon Age into trilogies and we haven't heard a word about Jade Empire 2.Paradoxically, this is also Bioware's most unique RPG.  It is a martial arts RPG set in a high fantasy world inspired by Chinese folklore.  The combat animations are very good, creating using motion capture technology of actual martial arts professionals.Here's the problem: the combat is bad.  For a game with a heavy focus on combat, that is very problematic.  The animations look great, but as a player all you do is push a few buttons to either: quick attack, power attack, block, or area attack.  While the player can obtain other styles, almost everything combat has to offer in the game is experienced in the tutorial.  Combat then becomes a routine affair of whitling down enemy health while jumping around trying to avoid damage.  Pro tip: don't use the ""Thousand Cuts"" style, as a result of its animation timing (seriously), it is notably inferior to the other starting styles.More problematic: character creation is incredibly linear.  As you level up, your Health, Chi, and Focus increase.  You then can assign 3 points to either Health, Chi, or Focus.  Pro Tip: Chi is probably the best option.  Meaning, multiple playthroughs will feel very similar to each other.  Still, the game does have a story similar to other Bioware hits.  If you liked Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect for the story, you will enjoy this game for the story alone.  It is suitably epic, has a pretty big twist towards the end, and frankly there is nothing else quite like this game.  The characters are well written, and Henpecked Ho and Black Wirlwind provide good comic relief.  Protip: For combat, just use Dawn Star's support mode, which replenishes Chi.			"

												This game is truly a really great game. It is a brilliant game that is just beautiful. I absolutely loved it on the xbox and was overjoyed to find it here on steam. I would truly love nothing more than to highly recommend it to anyone and everyone... Sadly though I can not as it does not work on steam nor does it look like that will change anytime in the near future. There are a few lucky souls who after hours upon hours of tinkering have gotten this game to work for them... Sadly though they are a very, very, very small percent. If your PC happen to be running anything remotely new do not expect this game to work. Expect to see many, many ""Failed to find steam"" messages. I bought this game back in March and I have tinkered with it for countless hours, have tried every work around that exists on the internet and have yet to see it work. IF this game ever gets fixed (and that is looking like a very big IF)... IF by some miracle this game ever does happen to get fixed I would highly recommend it but at this point that looks like it will never happen. For now save your money and buy something that actually works. Valve, EA, and BioWare really dropped the ball on this amazing game.			"

												Amazing game as it is, and with ""Jade Empire in Style"" (google it) it just becomes absolutely beautiful.The story is held together with duct tape but it's entertaining nevertheless. The characters are interesting... if a bit predictable. The karma system leaves a lot to be desired. Its redeeming qualities are the amazing combat and fantastic pacing. Lots of combat variety, interesting enemies that can crush you if unprepared and a good number of fun things to try out.The companions you have are all really rather enjoyable and have a lot of personality. Henpecked Hou is a favorite of mine.I really recommend you give it a try.			"

Needed to reinstall Window, I didn't wanted to go on shady website in attemp to make it work after that. If you don't want anything tedious to make it work, don't buy it. And as I said previously no support from Bioware, nor 2K, nor EA, so... nothing official to help.			"

Nor do they have a phone number to trouble shoot any issues u have on any game they host. once i got it going it is as fun as i remembered. remember if you cannot get it to run look in the forum. graphics of course are dated because it is an older game, sound is same as for xbox.

												This game is without the shred of doubt one of the best bioware games this man has played in his lifetime. The story is just a rich flowing river of awesomeness that never ends. There are many twists and turns that are sure to grab audiences by the thousand. The story alone should be a reason to buy this game as it is something Bioware is famed for and this is just fantastic. A standard good and evil choice, though it is described differently in a way. I must say it knows how to make these conflicting choices enjoyable at times, while making us feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥doing it. It was a true marvel. The combat and the fighting styles this game presents are simply amazing, they go very well with their surroundings and are unique in any given situation. The chi function brought out is a worthy life saver. Altogether this game is a classic titan among its genre. Talking about it is one thing, playing it is what needs to happen. In reference to its negative reputation on steam: Yes there are issues getting the game to work, but the community has sorted those concerns out. More or less. While i originally believed i had wasted my time and money i in fact bypassed the issue with help. IT is well worth its price, you just have to be patient.			"

												I first played Jade Empire on the original xbox and was mesmerized and enchanted by the bold, beautiful interpretation of Ancient China presented in the game. I was so hyped reading previews for it that I bought the game the day it came out because I knew it was going to be an awesome and the company who created it had a great track record at the time.  It was made by Bioware in their heyday back when all they had was Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and KOTOR under their belts. It had a fantastic story, interesting characters, a morality system and fun, intuitive fighting system that was easy to pick up. Pretty much everything people loved about KOTOR with a better combat system and a original setting. If there was IP that I wish Bioware would pick back up, it would be Jade Empire. If this game is on sale, GET IT! If not, 10 dollars isn't bad for all the content and fun that you can get. The only complaint that I have about this version as that with a lot of older games there are some compatbility issues with later OS. A small hindrance and is easily remedied with some tinkering. If you have never played this game or don't own it, and you are even remotely interested in the setting, GET THIS GAME!! 10/10 "

												for all these people claming the game is broken there is a simple fix that i will post in this comment because i got the cant find steam problem and when i did this it worked just fine and it saves u all are welcome in the future:) If the config tool fails to launch with a ""Can't find Steam"" error message, simply restarting Steam should fix that.If the issue persists or the config tool freezes at one point while gathering system information on your first launch, try the following;Locate the JadeEmpireConfig file in the game's Steam folder (usually found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Jade Empire)Right click, select properties, select compatibility and set it to compatibility mode for Windows Vista SP2.If this fails to fix the freeze, you must do the following;Using notepad, create a blank text file.Name it SystemInformation.xml and save it in the data folder inside the Jade Empire folder (usually found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Jade Empire\data).Copy the Steam.dll file from the base Steam folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam) and paste it into the Jade Empire folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Jade Empire - NOT the data folder).Information This will effectively bypass the config tool which should allow you to launch the game.

												So I'm here to tell it like it is, because honestly I doubt anyone will; this game is OK. No, it's not ""great,"" but it's extremely good at what it does; you feel flighty and free in combat. So let's do a simplified list because otherwise people won't read past the first sentence:Pros:1) A variety of both martial and magical styles in the vanilla version -- this allows for several concepts to take shape with each different playthrough, such as a sword-wielding maniac that uses fire to immolate his foes2) Pleasing visual styles -- the forms look graceful or rough as it is appropriate. Dodging is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game due to how light your character will feel; it is almost as if you have wings in combat. The lighting is also gorgeous in several areas, and that really brings out the beauty of the pseudo-Chinese architecture. 3) Replayability -- if you beat the game, you have the option of doing a new game + through the Jade Master mode. 4) Intriguing lore and setting -- Jade Empire has beautiful bestiary entires and journals scattered throughout the world in the form of culture-appropriate scrolls or books. Much of the history inside the game, including that of the creatures, is highly stimulating. Cons (buckle up):1) Extremely repetitive gameplay -- while the game looks and feels fantastic, the simplistic combat mechanics become almost laborous after a few hours into the game, ESPECIALLY against some of the mush more difficult opponents. Eventually it boils down to mashing on an enemy for several seconds until they die, which in Jade Master mode becomes minutes. The only saving grace to this is the ability to swiftly slaughter small-scale enemies with the Harmonic Combos in the game. Unfortunately, this also means that everything eventually guides you towards taking a few specific styles just to progress in a sane way.2) Copy and Paste enemies -- this is a tiny con. You'll find yourself running into the same enemies using the same styles and the same heads but on slightly different bodies. BioWare games are notorious for this re-use of content to fill gaps, but here it feels quite coarse; enemies are far too similar, even into the latter half of the game. When you see elite guards using the same poking spear that the peasents wielded in the start of the game, we have a problem.3) Strength of styles -- it's obvious the team did a ton of balance before they finished this (not), so you'll be left tossing your favorite style in the trash if it's not one of the top tier, otherwise you'll run into a ton of issues in the harder fights or in Jade Master (which is seriously going to test how well you know your combos and styles). 4) Lack of character development/Lack of interesting characters -- I'll be honest here, I thought almost every companion you could get turned out to be 1-dimensional. At least in KotOR I cared about several of the allies working with me, but here everything feels far too stiff. The only character I found interesting was the ridiculous comedic relief. It just feels so forced.The game is fun if you can look past some of the defects and appreciate it for what it is: a kung-fu beat-em-up with a paper-thin story and paper-thin characters. People put this game near the bottom of the BioWare list and it definitely earns its spot, however...A certain modder (may she be blessed) has created one of the most fantastic modifications for this game I have ever seen: Jade Empire in Style. It does everything right; character skins, new styles, new combat mechanics, better combos, more combos, more enemies, etc. It's fantastic. It doesn't try to fix anything broken with the story or characters, it builds on the game's strength--the Kung Fu. And holy cow does it do it well! Here's a link to the modder's site if you're interested in expanding your Jade Empire experience: http://jade-empire-in-style.com/ "

												(even though Steams shows I only played half an hour of the game, the truth is I finished it several years ago)This game is simply amazing. It has something to offer for everyone; fast-paced and fun combat, great story, interesting characters, RPG elements, fun ""minigames"" (for lack of a better word), possible relationships with other characters (and especially Sky). The graphics don't look as amazing as they seemed several years ago, but the visual side is still pleasant to look at and very characteristic. What made this game one of my favourites was the story. Even though it may seem a bit boring at the beginning, soon the story grips you and doesn't let go until you finish the game. Not only you visit interesting locations and meet various people (who actually seem like real characters and not just something generated for a game), you also make significant choices that affect the game's ending. The last element I would like to mention is the combat. As for my character, I chose the Leaping Tiger style and after upgrading it to maximum, I think it's the best I could have chosen, maybe with an exception of Crimson Tears, but they require a lot of focus. But I loved the way you could learn new styles (Drunken Fist was hilarious) and that you could choose how your companion would support you (active/passive). The only downside to this game is that the Steam version is somewhat buggy. In my case, the game was in slow motion. I managed to solve the issue, though I can't remember how. If you're unsure whether you would like this game, I recommend waiting for a Steam sale. If it's below 5 euro, you won't regret getting it.			"

												Wow, I am amazed at this gem of a game. Once again Bioware doesn't dissapoint with their masterful storytelling, plot and gameplay.Graphically, this special edition has improved the textures of the original and added in extra features not present in the original game. Even though the game is years old, the atmosphere is colorful and vivid with very well done asian influenced concepts.In the gameplay department, the controls are a bit stiff even when playing with the gamepad. Controls are very much like ""The Legend Of Zelda"", everything is in real time and most enemies will gang up on you. Red bar is obviously health, Blue bar is for healing, magic attack or add damage to physical attack, Yellow bar is for weapon or bullet time.I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy Bioware games and/or people who are into games with a near perfect blend of story and gameplay. People say this game is short, but that's only if you rush through it...Also...Storm Dragon is OP, it is so broken especially when maxed out...except for fighting ghosts, I hate fighting ghosts :(			"

												i bought this game when it was on sale. its a great game i knew nothing about. i read once somewhere the title but not much more. than i watched one 20 minutes lets play on youtube and was facinated about the setting and the fighting style. so i bouht it and got into it.great game you should consider to play when you like story based rpg´s. the graphics is not up to date but it looks realy great on some spots (check out my screenshots). the fighting system is okay but feels like that martial art magician mix. the story is very good in the begining but devalops to a middle class story in my opinion.finaly it was worth the money and i love you steam ..V_ (o.O) _V..

												Wonderful setting, engaging plot and beautiful art style, but be SURE to get the ""Jade Empire in Style"" Mod for this game.  Without it, Jade Empire's combat system totaly lets down it's other piece with a poorly thought out core gameplay mechanics set discourages experimentation and punishes variety and forces you to choose between watching one set of animations ad nauseum the whole game or trying out a variety of styles that are all underleveled and cripling.With the mod, the combat system lives up to the level of all the other pieces of this excellent game.  Google ""Jade Empire in Style"" and find the instructions and enjoy.			"

												honestly, I kind of wish they expanded on this. it's that good of a story.if I remember right, this came around sometime shortly before KOTOR-2 came out (and we all know how ""that"" turned out...) but even still with that coming around, this game still got attention. it's in-depth story & progressional expositions & transitions, it's (at the time) dynamic graphics. it's got some limits on it's action & play-through variety, but you have to understand that this game is dated, around the time some while after KOTOR-1 came around, this type of game was new and experimental. and this game shows sign of that stage. but even despite that, it still stands out. even the endigs were perfect for the story. it was pretty strong on it's own rights, I really wish they expanded on this project & came out with another game, either a sequel or a stand-alone.If you like RPG stories with a good depth & development, with decent visuals & intricated styles (even in vintage degree like in this case) this game you will be interested in. but if you're not willing to grasp the concept of all pointed out in this review, and rather go for a more action-packed & up-to-date RPG, this msy not be a game for you, I would suggest to go for something like the latest FABLE, or Elder Scrolls.now there is a small complication that seems to be the case for many people who want to download this game, and it won't start up after you get it going. believe me, I have had the same problem.check the forums for this game. there, you'll find out how to make the game work.

												I never once looked forward to playing Jade Empire after the first time booting it.  Sure, it was serviceable enough of an RPG to keep me coming back until its conclusion but the game's flaws are too numerous and damaging to make it truely enjoyable or worthy of recommendation.  From its exposition-choked opening hours to its final moments which can be replayed quickly to achieve all possible endings, thus cheapening the experience, Jade Empire just feels weak and overwrought.  Dialogue is so ridiculously heavy and voice acting sometimes so poor that it had me angrily jamming my finger into the LMB repeatedly within ten minutes of starting the game.  Despite the game's insistence that I use various martial styles to deal with different combat situations, I rarely needed to do more than equip my longsword and spam the LMB in order to win fights.  Meh.  Jade Empire is clearly the result of a young Bioware biting off more than it can chew.  Add to this the fact that Bioware and Valve released a broken and unplayable version of this game onto Steam, requiring the consumer to do the necessary legwork to get it working and the result is a very resounding NO.

												This game is... interesting. I purchased it upon recommendation from some friends. I was initially rather frustrated due to compatibility issues with modern machines - be warned, this game has some issues with Windows 8. If you are running W8, make sure you go into your SteamApps/common/Jade Empire folder, then run the ""Jade Empire.exe"" as an administrator - this usually fixes any issues you have with it. It also tends to be a bit disagreeable with dual monitors and alt-tabbing. The game itself is typical of BioWare, before they really solidified their RPG formula. It is very reminiscent of KOTOR, minus a lot of the polish. The story is fairly predictable and cliché - it's almost to the point where I startred treating it as a martial arts parody. The big ""twist"" can also be seen a mile away, and it wasn't all that great either. Generic good vs. evil morality system, characters are fairly flat and one-dimensional. Difficulty is all out of whack and oscillates with little predictability, with some fights being frustrating, and the majority being too easy. Overall, it's... okay. It's not great, but it isn't a bad game either. Definitely worth a try if you can pick it up on sale for cheap.			"

												Jade Empire's a weird game. BioWare's known for having phenomenal writing and solid gameplay, but with this game they tried something different. As their first foray into action-RPG's, it's a bit rough. The combat is far too easy and formulaic, the controls weren't translated all that well from Xbox, and the story's pretty weak, but it's still a fun, interesting action-RPG that's well worth checking out.

												Bioware took a gamble with a fresh IP that brought not only an unusual setting but also a rather stark departure from conventional RPG combat mechanics. Unfortunately, what starts off as an intriguing world with some real challenge ultimately becomes a tedious and almost entirely linear slog.After finishing the obligatory tutorial area, the game's world opens up and you're free to indulge in a variety of side quests. While the writing is typical for a Bioware game, you'll encounter interesting scenarios and in some cases make unexpected (if not entirely nuanced) choices. The game uses a binary morality system, similar to Knights of the Old Republic, but the line between good and evil is not always as clear and sometimes it's best to take different routes if only to witness the most interesting results.Early on, the combat is challenging and you're encouraged to experiment with new styles--at times you're even forced to when facing enemies that are immune to certain types of attacks. It's a little clunky and doesn't hold a candle to proper action titles, but it works and is not really the focus of the game early on.Unfortunately, the final third of the game eschews this formula almost entirely. You're taken through several sequences of pretty much non-stop fighting, which is where the shortcomings of the combat system really become noticeable. Fights take too long to finish and you will most likely end up exploiting one or two strategies as surefire ways to take care of the onslaughts of enemies. Gone is the element of choice or character development -- you probably won't even feel the need to spend level-up points, given how easy the game becomes with just a few side quests under your belt. At this point in the game, it becomes very clear that the developers ran out of resources and hastily put together the final segments without much concern for the player. While the momentum had previously been building at a steady and satisfying rate, completing the journey becomes a chore. You're robbed of any real pay off.The game ran fine for me on Windows 10, barring the occaisional stuttering error, which were usually fixed with system reset. Technically, the game certainly shows its age, but the lackluster final act is what really undoes the whole thing. Unless you really like the idea of awkward real-time martial arts combat in an RPG, give this one a pass. Better games have come since its release.			"

												I love this game's flavor and story, but be warned that it is pretty deeply entrenched in Bioware's RPG Cliches. The setting is awesome but the story felt like it came off quick to me: maybe this is because over the course of 3 days and did in a sense rush through it.  But I did all but one quest that I came across and the game seemed a bit small. Most of the exploration and adventuring you do is only available to you for the first three chapters where afterwards you are basically locked into the main plot.Jade Empire feels smaller to me than KOTOR and is significantly smaller than Mass Effect, but it stands firmly by itself and is a good game. If you ever wanted to play kung-fu-action-jesus-Shephard for a little bit, give it a go.			"

												This is one of the original Bioware RPGs, and surprisingly still holds up pretty damn well. Not only is it fun to play, but it's also cool as a case study in Bioware's methodology. You can see the influences that this game had on their later games, which (to me at least) is pretty interesting.			"

												Don't let nostalgia get the better of you. The Steam version is broken as♥♥♥♥♥♥ It wouldn't run on startup, and once I fixed that problem, I ran into the performance issues and could not resolve them no matter what I did. I tried changing the refresh rate, running the game in compatibility mode, and using the debug link (which doesn't exist now, apparently). No dice. This game meant so much to me growing up. The story and writing are impeccable. It's a shame it's so jank on Steam. I really do love Jade Empire and still want a sequel. I hope it at least works on other formats. It would be a shame if newcomers were turned away just because of the performance.			"

												So uh...this PC port does not start off well, basically being a broken product at a first impression. As far as I know you could have the best specs and still start the game unbelievably choppy in this build for whatever reason; yet behind the scenes you are still running at 30fps/60fps when scrolling the menu or seeing the clothes on your character react to the physics... Anyway, it's weird, it's unplayable, but I will tell you to get this game, for its merits of being one of Bioware's classics, and (most importantly) being able to fix this game within this first hour and half of me looking online and fiddling with stuff (which I believe anyone can do, thankfully). You're in your right to be discouraged from this since Steam basically put up an unbroken yet unplayable product, and just leave you there alone to figure it out, but in these easy steps I think you're guaranteed to have the game itself running as it should, and in less time to try and figure it like I had to:1. Go into your Environment Variables (easy way to pull it up is to search on the start menu and click ""edit environment variables"", but otherwise it is somewhere in the control panel), you'll see under ""User variables for [your username]"" there's a variable called ""Path"" - click on it, then click Edit. On the ""variable value:"" textbox, go to the very end of it (or hit ""End"" key), and copy/paste in the path of your Steam folder along with what is already there like this -;C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam ^it has to be seperated from the rest of the folder-paths starting with a semi-colon, and note this is an example, but usually your Steam folder should be in Program Files (x86) of your hard-drive - this will resolve the ""Can't find Steam"" error everytime you even try to start this game...2. The ONLY way to get rid of the chopping performance of the game is to go here - https://bitbucket.org/fk/jade-empire-stutter-fix/downloads - and download this zip folder, containing a Readme for instructions, a .dll file and C++ redistributable (vcredist_x86.exe). You simply extract the folder, and put those files in your Jade Empire folder (where your JadeEmpire.exe file is), and if you haven't installed the redistributable already (which usally comes with most games and already installed it for you) then do it again with this one supplied for you just in case. And all of this is verified and was tested on the GOG build of the game they are selling, so it should work for this build being sold by Steam.3...that's...actually it. You can do this in 2 minutes tops. Run the game from Steam and now it should work for you, from there you just see how it fairs on your computer, but considering it's an old game, the recommeded specs shouldn't be at all daunting. If it's still giving you a bit of trouble, you can right-click on the JadeEmpire.exe, go into Properties - Compatibility, run this in Windows XP compatibility mode, along with checking ""Run as an administrator"" and click Apply and try to run it again. Aside from that, you'll just have to figure out how your computer fairs with it personally, but the game itself should run properly and not flat-out broken for the customer. Hope everyone sees this at first glance when buying this game and get it running, just thought you might wanna' save some time and get right into playing this gem, or at least know what you're getting into before purchasing.--EDIT--I take it all back, fu-k this port...keeps crashing otherwise, well at least for me. If it's fine on your computer, god bless ya but I'm getting my refund right this minute. Really wanted to play this game. Thanks Steam...			"

												So I understand this isn't exactly a popular review, and really that's to be expected whenever you're critical of a popular and acclaimed game.  Honestly, I was pretty angry when I originally wrote my review below, but now that I have a clear head, I wanted to clarify something:I dont' give a♥♥♥♥♥♥what your experience with this game was.MY experience was that this game was so agonizingly terrible that I didn't feel it was worth my time to keep playing long enough finish the tutorial.So if you ask me ""Hey Dubhe14, would you like recommend this game or whatever just askin'""I'd be like ""no, this game makes playing Too Human with beer goggles sound fun by comparison""The story was bad.  The combat was bad.  The game mechanics were bad.  Graphics were pretty alright considering its age, I can't really complain.  Dialogue was bad.  Characters were bland and uninteresting.""well maybe dubee14 just sucks and is totally jellz that he wasn't good at this game like I am"" betch I have nearly 200 hours on Dark Souls don't bring that ""u jus suk"" nonsense in here.Jade Empire is like your second playthrough of Knighs of the Old Republic, where you purposefully make all the bad choices just to be 100% evil, except they did it with design choices instead, and the result was a game that is 100% poop.------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I was really excited to play this game, since it gets unreal praise from everyone.  Too bad it's terrible.Combat:  This game has the most unintuitive, unengaging, clunky, button-mashing-dependant, wtf-was-that-unfair combat system I've ever seen in any game.  The combat system is built for 1-on-1 fights, but the game constantly pits you against 6 people at once, some of which will invariably be wielding weapons.  Since there are no area or sweeping attacks, and you're forced to damage one enemy at a time, this means you'll get surrouncded and stun-locked to death.  Oh, and wielding weapons depletes your ""Focus"" bar - when it gets empty, you are restricted from using weapons, a limit not placed on your enemies.Dodging: In the game options, you can change the dodge controls - you can have your character dodge when you double tap in a direction, or when you move in a direction while holding down ""Block"".  Choosing double-tap means your character will dodge forward whenever you change directions mid-run outside of combat - only forward, though, that's the only direction you're allowed to doge in outside of combat.  Needless to say, this gets very aggravating very quickly.Camera:  All the game's problems are exacerbated by the game's camera, which hovers right behind your character, but low enough that you can't see your hands.  This basically makes it impossible to judge how far away you are from an enemy, and whether you're close enough for your attack to hit.  It's a crap-shoot.  Easily fixable if you could angle the camera to one side, but it resets right away.Maybe it's a bad port to PC, and that's the reason for all these problems?  I can't belive this game came out 2 years after KOTOR, which had none of the issues above.  I can count on one hand how many games I've willingly abandoned, and now Jade Empire is part of that list, right next to Fable 3.  Maybe the story becomes AMAZING a few more hours in, but this game is absolute agony to play through - not worth it to me.			"

												This was a game made back when BioWare was actually good. The combat is a little bit repetitive, but it is at least rich with the different types of martial art styles you can choose from. Character customization leaves something to be desired, but you're supposed to be playing a Chinese person so it can be forgiven. Characters are memorable, the plot to save the Jade Empire is engrossing and it has a pompous John Cleese character. 10/10 good stuff.			"

												This is one of the best Action RPG choice driven games that Bioware has ever made, before being bought out by EA. Seriously this is #1 on my OLD Bioware favorites, #2 being tied to the original first and second KOTORs. Mass Effect and Dragon age are good series, don't get me wrong...but...I prefer this. And highly reconmend trying this out.			"

												Old School Bioware RPG. It has a moral choice system that actually somewhat works well with the setting and style. The story is fantasticly well done with just the right amount of cheesiness. The occasional Galaga style mini games break the pace just enough to enhance the rest of the gameplay. The game itself plays very much like KOTR in a very good way. Though of course, that's just my opinion.			"

												An amazing classic that still holds up well today!This version of the game does have alot of problems.It stutters like crazy in the middle of the game and continues to do it all through out the rest of the game,There's this annoying start up problem that prevents you from playing the game until you do some file adding in the Steam Apps folders. Luckily it's a one time thing but it was really annoying! You can find a guide to fix this problem in the community hub of this game. Trust me, you're gonna need it!But beyond that, This is a good with a strong impactful story. You can make choices that decides the fate of your enemies and allies, there will be choices all through out the game that you must make. And the best thing about these choices are, They do matter aswell as shape the story and all of your actions have consequences to them.Despite how good this game is, I can't 100% recommend Jade Empire: Special Edition to everyone. You're better off playing Jade Empire: limited edition on the Original Xbox, That is the definitive version! Jade Empire: Special Edition is one of those crappy PC ports of good games. I'll only recommend this Special Edition version only if you have no other way to play Jade empire.Ps. I almost forgot!Jade Empire does have romance options for Straight & gay.The Special Edition automatically shortens certain scenes to the point of where you think ""Why didn't they just remove this scene completely!""Even the romance scenes were shortened so bad that you can't even see it!Play the Jade Empire: Limited Edition on Original Xbox. You'll love it!			"

												(Originally owned on PC CD-ROM; completed game about 3 times)This is one of THE best games by Bioware. Plays a lot like Knights of the Old Republic but uses asian influence lore and design. Different martial arts styles, some of which can only be learned if you are a master of the Open Hand or Closed Fist (light side/dark side). Many different endings, shmup mini-game (Shoot'Em Up). GREAT Storyline imo.			"

												Recommendation-This is a truly beautiful game, which presents a lovingly crafted and genuinely fascinating world, a host of fantastic characters and a great sense of freedom in terms of your actions in what is mostly a very polished package, and I happily recommend it to any PC gamer.Rough Plot-Jade Empire,  is loosely based on the legends of China - although Bioware has been careful to stress that it's not actually ancient China, which allows them to play around with all manner of elements ranging from geography to the inclusion of technology (often magic-powered) such as aircraft. Your character starts out as the star student of a martial arts school in a remote village, and in typical RPG style, you and your companions are quickly caught up in Much Bigger Things - to wit, the aforementioned ghouls, firebombings, and balance of heaven and earth - and sally forth to travel around the Jade Empire putting things right.

												April 2014.   I always wanted to play this game a long time ago ~2008...now I see it still selling on steam, so I give it a try since I have time now (2014)...It did not work for me recently in April 2014 and on windows 8 but still selling on steam.   Renaming the file to fix does not work either.But I found a fix on the net in one for the steam forum somewhere and related to other older games... Like the renaming fix, only the main exe works as workaround.    To fix, you need to add ""steam"" to your win8 environment PATH variable.Here's how for windows 8:1. control panel -> system icon -> Advanced system settings -> (this launch windows system properties)2. Advanced tab -> click on ""environment variables"" button.  (this launch environment variables user interface)3. on bottom section, inside system variables, select ""PATH"" variable from list.4. click edit button at bottom to edit PATH variable that you select above (3).5. append to variable value the text "";C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam;""  Make notice semicolon before and after and no blank space outside of ;click cancel to abort anytime.step 5 is important, do not mess up.  Or you may have to reinstall your computer.  Do not click okay until you are sure you did not mess up.   You can always come back and fix if you can retype the whole entire  string content from memory.   Click cancel to abort anytime.   Click okay when you are sure you did it right.  FYI: the entire string content is similar on most computer...you are fine if you make typo, just go back and edit.   Deleting and forgot entry is where re-install windows is a fix.  Here is what entire string content looks like on mine minus qoutes minus "":""C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files (x86)\ATI Technologies/ATI.ACE/Core-Static;C:/Users/Nhan/AppData/Local/Smartbar/Application/;C:/Program Files (x86)\Steam;""6. reboot computer to get environment path variable updated.?  play.

												""I want to join the arena.""""That's the spirit of the thing! Now, what name precedes you in your travels?""""I am Egregious Prevaricator, respected scholar and grower of pipe weed. I'm shocked you haven't heard of me.""Yes, you can actually adopt the name 'Egregious Prevaricator' as your arena name. This game was criticized by reviewers for its sub-par graphics and its quintessinally 'Bioware' story. But those reviewers completely overlooked the things that make the game one of the most memorable I've ever played. The colorful, vivid art style. The truly immersive, epic soundtrack. The fantastic Wuxia setting, completely novel in a cliched genre full of Lord of The Rings-esque elves and dwarves. The unforgettably nuanced characters. The riveting writing. The sense of a living, breathing world that broke conventions and boldly expanded the RPG genre.This game remains, to this day, my favorite Bioware artwork. Must buy.

												This game is KOTOR in Little big Chinatown. It's more homage to the Chinese Marital-art house asthetic than an RPG set in a faithflly re-created Ancient China, which will hit you as soon as the Steampunk technology comes into play.If you've played the Bioware Knights franchise, this game will feel right at home to you. The dialogue system, the alignment system, the influence over companions, etc. is all inherited from the 1st game.The only serious deviation is askewing of realtime-turn-based combat, for 3rd person combat. You click, and your character attacks, you can move and manuever your character at will.There is also a shoot-em' up mini-game which, at times I think clashes with the rest of the game in tone, but otherwise is memorable where most of BIoware's mini games were either boring or insufferable.Perhaps the most memorable feature to this game? The Cast. Alot of star power arrived for this outing, Nathan Fillion, Brian Doyle Murray, Armin Shimerman, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly John Cleese, and anyone whose played adapation titles like Devil May Cry or Final Fantasy 9 or Armored Core 4 will recognize Kari Wahlgren.I honestly can't recommend this game enough, but be warned, Imperfect Customer has it right, you do need to mess with some files inorder to get the game both to work, and for your cursor (the mouse pointer) to appear.If you're experiencing this problem download this file and put it into your Jade Empire directory:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22012712/JadeEmpireLauncher.exeIt's an old Jade Empire exe renamed ""JadeEmpireLauncher"" so steam will launch it instead of the launcher which can end in error. You still need to launch the game from Steam though, clicking on it won't do anything. Your Jade Empire Directory can be found in Steam-> SteamApps -> Common-> Jade Empire.			"

												I had no problem starting this game on Windows 8.1. But I have solved the a previous ""can't find steam"" error due to VtM: Bloodlines. Just add the steam folder to the path (i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam). Or it was fixed due to it being a special edition.In any case, I have heard a lot of good things about the game, and while I'm just starting, at least the first 3 hours lives up to it. Yes, it is a bit aged. But it appears to have aged well. The fights are more twitch based than turn based, so I don't have the opportunity to pause the game as in KotOR or Dragon Age. But beside that, just stating ""It is an adventure in a mythological ancient China, made by Bioware"" should tell enough to anyone familiar with that company.			"

												Jade Empire is a good game the highlight being that you won't get bored with the combat system and stuff, the items and upgrades are unique with a nice twist.  Ok that's the good now for the bad.  Good voice acting and some side quests.  Sometimes funny side quests.First off the game is linear with sidequests which means that you can't go arround doing whatever you want in order to get the next set of side quests you have to do the next main quest.  Also this is bioware but which is good with the romance quests but there is not that good in that it was kinda lacking compared to dragon ages 1 and 2.  You can choose between evil guy and good guy.			"

												If you like Bioware-style RPGs, definitely consider getting this game--especially if it's on sale. A lot of folks have been complaining about being unable to run the game, but there are a number of fixes for the issue listed online. I initially had the same problem, but after running the game as an administrator and fiddling around with a few of the game's settings, I was able to get the game working and haven't had any problems since.As far as the game goes, the level design is impressive--many of the areas still look nice, despite the outdated graphics. The dialogue can be hokey at times, and it's important to keep in mind that the game is not at all an accurate representation of Chinese culture and narrative. The levelling and customization system is not as deep as other RPG's, but overall combat is fun and more oriented toward the Action RPG genre than KOTOR. There's a really excellent mod called Jade Empire In Style that adds a lot more depth to the game's combat and customization system if players feel like the vanilla version isn't satisfying enough. The story, while far from perfect and full of cliches, is good enough to keep the player engaged and interested in what will happen next. My biggest complaint about the game mechanics is the morality system--it is apparent that Bioware was attempting to make a morality system that was less about good vs. evil, and more about whether or not the ends justify the means. If this system were to have been implemented correctly, it would be possible to take the path of the ""closed fist"" without being an evil jerk. Unfortunately, despite a fair amount of dialogue in the game about how neither ""path"" is inherently evil, it's not really possible to follow the way of the closed fist without being a really terrible excuse for a human being.Right now I'm far from beating the game, so I can't comment on the ending, but despite it's flaws it's been a very enjoyable RPG.

												You probaly are looking at a lot of negative reviews about this game regarding the luancher and that can be easily fixed with a youtube or forum search on steam. My problem however is that this game wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I love bioware games, they are some of the best western rpg developers and there is some positive things about this game. This game for its time was beautiful and the character/enviroment designs are extremly well done for a 2007 port. The voice work as usual is very good and there are some great character designs in this game. It has widescreen/higher resolution support and you can even play with a controller.  However I couldn't help but feel that the story lacked a little bit compared to what I was use to in a bioware game. I say that becuase I felt the stories in thier other games like knights of the old republic, mass effect and the older dragon age games had more depth. When it went on sale for $3.75 I was estatic, however the more I played it I couldn't help but feel that I had to force myself to keep playing. In a sense I felt underwhelmed and lost interest the more I played it. Also there was some stuttering present even after the suggested fixes were applied and there was this horrible random camera glitch that occured more than 6 times during my play through were you got a birds eye view and couldnt see your character or see where you were going. The games difficulty was surprizingly hard and I felt like I needed to save alot, something you will need to do a lot of in this game. The combat system is fun and creative, but that was not enough to keep my interest. Bottom line is that if you came off of knights of the old republic or any of bioware's older rpgs, you might need to lower your expectations for this one to truly enjoy it. Despite some of the postive things I said, I couldn't in good spirits recommend this game. Fun fact though is that it does have some mods on modb.overall a  7.2/10			"

												Jade Empire is an essential Bioware roleplaying experience.  I prefer it to earlier offerings like Baldur's Gate because their creative team realized their own fantasy world from the ground up.  It sucessfully blends the tropes and conventions of classic wire flying films and asian folktales in what feels like a love letter to the genre.As I write this the JE is almost ten years old and examining it reveals a prototype for the story driven/ action rpgs like DA and ME that would follow.  It is a sweeping tale that that places the player in the familiar role of the ""chosen one"" whose actions will shape the course of the entire world as they chart their own personal destiny.  If this were a tabletop rpg I would hate this contrived convention but it works quite well in a single player video game. My only complaint is that the PC version seems to respond more sluggishly to controller input than the console version that I played when it relased in 04.			"

												The game itself is pretty good, its a lot like other Bioware games in its focus on character and story with decent RPG and combat mechanics. The Asian setting is refreshingly unusual for a western RPG and overall its a game well worth playing, not one of Biowares best but that is a high bar to reach. Unfortunately this version is extremely difficult to get working on a 64bit OS. I have tried to install it on windows 7 and windows 8.1 and it failed to work on either without quite a bit of surfing forum posts for solutions, most of which didn't help in the slightest as every OS seems to have a range of problems running this game and finding the solution for my particular problem ""Application Error: Steam failed to start"" (despite steam running at the time) was difficult to say the least. Eventually I got it working by copying the Steam.dll from the main Steam folder ( C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam  - on my system) and replacing the Steam.dll file in the game folder ( C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Jade Empire - on my system) with it.There is no guarantee that this fix will work for anyone else but it seems so ridiculously simple a fix that its just appalling the publisher hasn't bothered to fix it themselves. In addition the configuration utility, that you are forced to use, is simply broken on windows 7 and 8 but the game tries to force you to use it anyway. This requiredme to rename JadeEmpireLauncher.exe to something else (e.g. JadeEmpireLauncher_BACKUP.exe) and rename JadeEmpire.exe to JadeEmpireLauncher.exe.If you're happy to mess around with this like I did then the game itself is good, but for the amount of effort put in over two separate OS's and no guarantee that it will function on a third I can't really recommend buying it from steam until these problems are fixed (and seeing as these problems have been around for years and the developer is now owned by a different publisher its almost certain that they will never be fixed).

												This is easily one of my favourite games of all time. A story-driven RPG, with the usual Bioware morality scale, only far less black-and-white, good-and-evil, and more to do with the actual ethics of characters, rather than ""GOOD GUY HELP EVERYONE AND FART RAINBOWS, BAD GUY EAT PUPPIES AND SET EVERYTHING ON FIRE"". Think Star Wars (Especially since this came out around the same time as they were working on the Knights Of The Old Republic games), the 'Open-Palm' path is basically the Jedi to the more Sith-like 'Closed-Fist'.I may be slightly biased due to my love of martial arts and mythology, but this game is rich with both, so I don't care, it's great.It's basically like being the major protagonist of a fantasy, kung-fu, cult-classic movie, for 20+ hours. There are demons, spirits, gods, ghosts, assassins, pirates, heavenly plains, and so many other things that I can't mention without spoilers.There are a lot of comments and reviews and whatnot for this game saying that it's not playable, or it's broken, and that it's all Steam's fault everyone is awful wah I'm a big whiny man-baby. It's not broken. If you're not an idiot. This game is nearly a decade old. It needs a little help to be able to run on newer computers. If you're on Windows 7, you will need to go into the game files, right-click on the ""Jade Empire"" application, go into the compatibility settings and set to run with Windows XP compatibility.

												Now I have to agree with everybody who does not recommend this game, it is a pain to get working and can often seem like more trouble than it is worth, but it's not. It's worth all the trouble to play this amazing, deep, and layere game. The gameplay is very fun apart from random battles which often devolve into just swinging your limbs at people, though the boss fights feel like they take a lot of skill and are very involved. The story and the setting are amazing, I have beaten it 4 times and am still in awe of how impressed with the writing. Pick it up, find a fix online, and then watch your social life end.			"

												Yikes.  I went in with fairly high expectations, which may have been a mistake.  I felt that combat and general navigation was very awkward and unsatisfying, and that the overall experience was bland and unremarkable.  Perhaps this was effectively a better title back in the day when it came out, relative to its competitors, but I say take a pass on this and hit some of the better CRPG's: Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate 2, and Dragon Age: Origins, just to name a few.

												Bioware really aced this one, in my opinion it was much better than Dragon Age 1 and 2, the fighting mechanics were very fluid and was far more than the hack and slash that DA is, each fight had merit and each strike you took against an enemy affected the enemy, I really wish they'd go back to doing this.

												I originally owned this on the xbox and completed it at least three times. It's a great RPG and incredibly underrated. The story is a bit cliche but fun and the combat is excellent. One could argue that this game with the real time combat was a blue print for what Bioware would eventually do in the upcoming Mass Effect games. I love this game and wish more people could get into it...unfortunately the steam version doesn't do this title any favors. I cannot recommend this title through steam as it is a hassle to get working. There are several steps you have to go through just to get the damn game to load. Once that's done you may experience problems with in game cut scenes and the music going out of sync. After about 30 minutes of editing and doing some homework through google I got everything working, but the fact that people need to go through all this effort is  totally stupid. I also noticed that you can play the game with the gamepad. I gave it a shot for nostalgia, and it's functional but the auto targeting system is a mess. For any newcomers interested in this title, unless you're willing to take a chance and have some decent PC skills, try and give it a shot, but only if the game is dirt cheap on sale. For everyone else, I've been told the GOG version of Jade Empire runs fine without any problems, so you may want to check them out instead. Steam really needs to pay more attention to the games it offers its customers.  "

												This is easily one of my favourite games of all time. A story-driven RPG, with the usual Bioware morality scale, only far less black-and-white, good-and-evil, and more to do with the actual ethics of characters, rather than ""GOOD GUY HELP EVERYONE AND FART RAINBOWS, BAD GUY EAT PUPPIES AND SET EVERYTHING ON FIRE"". Think Star Wars (Especially since this came out around the same time as they were working on the Knights Of The Old Republic games), the 'Open-Palm' path is basically the Jedi to the more Sith-like 'Closed-Fist'.I may be slightly biased due to my love of martial arts and mythology, but this game is rich with both, so I don't care, it's great.It's basically like being the major protagonist of a fantasy, kung-fu, cult-classic movie, for 20+ hours. There are demons, spirits, gods, ghosts, assassins, pirates, heavenly plains, and so many other things that I can't mention without spoilers.There are a lot of comments and reviews and whatnot for this game saying that it's not playable, or it's broken, and that it's all Steam's fault everyone is awful wah I'm a big whiny man-baby. It's not broken. If you're not an idiot. This game is nearly a decade old. It needs a little help to be able to run on newer computers. If you're on Windows 7, you will need to go into the game files, right-click on the ""Jade Empire"" application, go into the compatibility settings and set to run with Windows XP compatibility. There, I fixed it, now stop complaining.BUY IT. PLAY IT. IT'S GREAT.			"

												This is Bioware's unknown game that didn't get the recognition it deserved.  Jade Empire has the same feel as all of their other games, but instead is engulfed into a different atmosphere.  Any fans to the RPG genre should experience this game, but  I really urge any RPG fans that enjoy Bioware to get this game immediately.  I promise you won't be disappointed. Gameplay: 17/20 ... GREAT (if anything, it's too simple and lacks the complexity of standard RPG combat mechanics) Graphics: 5/5 ... PERFECTStory: 10/10 ... PERFECTSound/Music: 5/5 ...

												Jade Empire is a perfect example of  RPG game , with great story, lots of interesting characters and TONS of dialogues. Audio/Vidoe side of the game is also very impressive. Oriental styled music and graphics are both wonderful and full of details. Combat sytstem is in my opinion the weakest element of the game, but it still can be fun though (game offers many martial styles with include even the famous Drunken Master style )If you liked KotOR then you won't be dissapointed by playing Jade Empire.

												Another excellent game from Bioware. The Chinese-based universe is interesting and the characters and plot keep you involved. The combat isn't anything special, however, and Jade Empire fails to match up to KotOR in many other aspects as well. But then, very few games do. Certainly worth playing if you enjoyed KotOR or Mass Effect.			"

												Probably one of the most beautiful and deepest Bioware's rpgs ever made. Jade Empire is quite unique among PC rpg-s: It allows you to travel to a fantasy conceived ancient China and engage in a thrilling-deepest story with multiple choices, gorgeous scenery, absorbing figures of local mythology (spirits, demons, dragons etc), emotionally soothing specific music...ans great steampunk settings. To have the opportunity to change sword and bow (although some weapons can still be used), for the equally efficient asian bare handed combat style of choice is the dream of many players, fun, fast and challenging combat if you play it on grand master difficulty "

												Being Bioware's lightest RPG experience in their entire game library, Jade Empire most definitely stands out, if not only for that but also for delving into a setting rarely explored by western developers - that of Ancient China, albeit a fantasy version of one. Playing like an action RPG it is somewhat held back by its imprecise controls, one-note characters and simplistic mechanics, but overcomes these problems with an interesting setting, mere fact that it's a rare martial arts RPG and a genuine story twist. And in the end, it's easily one of the most underrated games Bioware has ever put out, but definitely worth your time.			"

												This game is one of Bioware's earlier RPGs before Mass Effect and Dragon Age modern fame.  Like a lot of developers, all their works share similar themes.  Good characterization, good humor, binary good / evil (although in this case its styled differently), good voice acting, etc.  The setting and music are characterization are all good and very well enjoyable, and quite amusing at times.  Bioware is very good at that, and I applaud them.The problem with the game is that the actual -game- portion is just not very fun.  The combat is downright awful because there is no balance or flow.  Most enemies could be button-mashed to death, and those that can't usually have some sort of rediculous advantage over the player such as no hitstun, extremely high damage, or extremely high health.  There are two types of MP, one for magic + healing and the other for weapons + bullet time... but considering that there is no other way to restore your health aside from generous cutscenes I can't see magic being useful.  Leveling up a weapon style makes it use almost no MP but bullet time drains MP like pouring water out of a cup.  Animations are VERY clunky and often uncancelable, and each style only has one combo and one guardbreak attack.  Controlling your character in fights is a pain because being locked on to an enemy makes you extremely slow, and free camera makes it impossible to hit enemies reliably.Levelling up gives points to spend in combat styles and other points to spend on stats, but there's no way to really know if you're going to get a good style later down the line and spent points are permanent.  Its a pitfall of RPGs, not knowing how well-spent your resources are because of a lack of transparency in the system.  Luckily stats are more easily corrected as you can swap equipment to boost the little used conversation stats and your primary stats, but nothing boosts your damage or defense directly.There are scant few puzzles in the game that really only pad or are otherwise obnoxious (get out a pen and paper because you'll need to memorize), and a seemingly pointless Galaga minigame that occurs often and produces no non-Galage related rewards.The game runs fine on Win7 / HD6850 / 3.2GHz * 6 / 8gb RAM system.  Its was made for the original XBOX and it shows, but the game controls perfectly fine on PC as a port even in the few fixed camera scenes.  I'd say pass on the game unless you like Bioware titles or the asian setting.  The combat in the game holds the whole package back far too much to be a robust title.  It's not worth suffering through for the story, which is only okay, even if well presented.			"

This is probably the most original RPG I've played; they created their own universe loosely based on the myths of ancient China and Japan, and invented a language with it. The musical score is absolutely beautiful too. As for the story, you can decide to be good or evil, or something in between, and the decisions you make impact the ending as well as what happens to the characters you meet.			"

												I really feel like I should bother to write a review for this game. Back in the days, I used to play this game quite a lot on my Xbox, so I was really excited when I realized that this game was also getting released on Steam. First off, let me address all the people saying that they could not get this game to run on Win7 and above. I myself also use Win7 and have played it multiple times without even a single glitch or bug. The game runs just as smoothly as it did on my console, if not even smoother. And if you had sacrificed a mere two minutes of your lives searching for a solution to the infamous ""Steam not found""-error you would be able to enjoy this game in its entirety as well. For those too thick-headed to look it up themselves: a) Either replace the JadeLauncher.exe with the JadeEmpire.exe orb) add your Steam directory as a path in Win7 (and above). It really is not that hard, guys. But enough with the whining. I came here to write a review about the game and this is what I will do. I'd really like to compose some kind of list of the pros and cons of the game but unfortunately, I cannot think of anything that'd fall into the latter category. Even though this game might not be up to the modern-day graphics standard (also meaning that there is no HD remake ... yet), the game makes up for it with an intense and engaging story, an entertaining combat system and a wide variety of different combat styles and techniques. The choice, as with many Bioware titles, is complely up to you: Whether you prefer the classic martial arts, like the brute force of a wide arsenal of different melee and (one...) ranged weapons, fancy being a ranged spellcaster or even prefer to transform into a various amount of demons to squish your foes in an instant, the game does offer you every single one of these possibilities. The choices you make on your way to your ultimate goal do, of course, affect how the story develops and how the people react to you. There are the two big classic sides of good (the so-called Way of the Open Palm) and bad (The Closed Fist). Depending on those you gain different trinkets and skills and shape the climax of the game. But you don't have to travel alone. The game helps you out with several companions, each one with an interesting back story and unique abilities. Don't like dragging someone along the whole time who is only getting in the way? It's not a problem! Almost every companion has two different ways to aid you in combat: Attack and support. But I do have to say that most of the compnions fancy you being the nice guy, so you might have a hard time dealing with them when walking the dark path. Unfortunately, there are some techniques in the game that cannot be accessed and learnt during the game (and of course, these are mostly only the cool ones). Nevertheless, some talented modder thought of a solution to this problem and released the best and most popular mod for Jade Empire: Jade in Style. If you already know the game and are looking for a little more variation in styles you should certainly check out this mod. The world of Jade Empire seems somewhat like a mashup of many different clichés of medival Asia but it really doesn't matter after the first few minutes of gameplay. Sadly, you cannot explore most areas - the game basically tells you where to go and the progression through the different areas is rather linear, especially when entering a dungeon. I'd really like to talk about its main feature - the story. But I won't because I do not want to spoil anything and I am not quite sure I would be able to say something different than ""OMG, it's so epic!!"" (you get the gist). Let me just say that the game contained the most WTF plot twist of my childhood. So, in conclusion, I'd like to say that I highly recommend this game. I have by far not talked about all the features this game offers because I feel that some things should be yours to discover.Once you get it to run, the whole experience is at least as good as it was ""in the olden days"". It even offers full (Xbox) controller support, but is just easy to play with a mouse and a keyboard (it's what I did). I hope that a few of you will not be deterred by the vast amount of negative reviews regarding the PC adaption because it really is a very good game.But go and see for yourselves!			"

												Quality Bioware from a time before EA. The game plays and unfolds in a typical bioware (back then bioware) fashion with the same sort of humble beginings and story twists you would hope to be suprised by. They are effective in making an Asian-influenced world with a fun and unique combat system based on real-time kung-fu combos and a sort of chi magic. Overall, it feels like an experiment for trying out many of the features and ideas they would make into Knights of the Old Republic. While feeling more shallow than KOTOR it still manages to entertain and should'nt be missed if you liked the original KOTOR or like kung-fu movies.			"

												The first Bioware game I ever played. Easily one of my all time favorites. It has a rather rich Wuxia setting, and a pretty unique combat system/style based on kung fu, wushu, and other arts found in Wuxia lore. The lore and characters are one of kind and very well written, each one with their own interesting background and motivation. I spent hours upon hours exploring when I first got this game, ages ago when it first came out. There really is no other game out there like Jade Empire, I still hold out hope for a sequel some day, even if its probably all in vain.			"

												This is easily one of my favourite games of all time. A story-driven RPG, with the usual Bioware morality scale, only far less black-and-white, good-and-evil, and more to do with the actual ethics of characters, rather than ""GOOD GUY HELP EVERYONE AND FART RAINBOWS, BAD GUY EAT PUPPIES AND SET EVERYTHING ON FIRE"". Think Star Wars (Especially since this came out around the same time as they were working on the Knights Of The Old Republic games), the 'Open-Palm' path is basically the Jedi to the more Sith-like 'Closed-Fist'.I may be slightly biased due to my love of martial arts and mythology, but this game is rich with both, so I don't care, it's great.It's basically like being the major protagonist of a fantasy, kung-fu, cult-classic movie, for 20+ hours. There are demons, spirits, gods, ghosts, assassins, pirates, heavenly plains, and so many other things that I can't mention without spoilers.There are a lot of comments and reviews and whatnot for this game saying that it's not playable, or it's broken, and that it's all Steam's fault everyone is awful wah I'm a big whiny man-baby. It's not broken. If you're not an idiot. This game is nearly a decade old. It needs a little help to be able to run on newer computers. If you're on Windows 7, you will need to go into the game files, right-click on the ""Jade Empire"" application, go into the compatibility settings and set to run with Windows XP compatibility. There, I fixed it, now stop complaining.BUY IT. PLAY IT. IT'S GREAT.			"

												I originally owned this on the xbox and completed it at least three times. It's a great RPG and incredibly underrated. The story is a bit cliche but fun and the combat is excellent. One could argue that this game with the real time combat was a blue print for what Bioware would eventually do in the upcoming Mass Effect games. I love this game and wish more people could get into it...unfortunately the steam version doesn't do this title any favors. I cannot recommend this title through steam as it is a hassle to get working. There are several steps you have to go through just to get the damn game to load. Once that's done you may experience problems with in game cut scenes and the music going out of sync. After about 30 minutes of editing and doing some homework through google I got everything working, but the fact that people need to go through all this effort is  totally stupid. I also noticed that you can play the game with the gamepad. I gave it a shot for nostalgia, and it's functional but the auto targeting system is a mess. For any newcomers interested in this title, unless you're willing to take a chance and have some decent PC skills, try and give it a shot, but only if the game is dirt cheap on sale. For everyone else, I've been told the GOG version of Jade Empire runs fine without any problems, so you may want to check them out instead. Steam really needs to pay more attention to the games it offers its customers.  "

												Of all the amazing RPG's that BioWare has made over its many many years, Jade Empire is the weakest entry. That is not to speak of it negatively, however, as it still possesses an engaging story with a creative mythos to play with. Gameplay is pretty mediocre, and the characters are not as memorable this time around. Yet still, the game will probably keep the hardcore RPG fan entertained long enough to complete its 20-30 hour experience. Not recommended to most gamers.			"

												Plotting and predictible this game is an extremely generic bioware game wrapped in a very interesting shell. Every second you play this game you will want to be playing the exact same game except done better.Combat is slow, clunky, unbalanced, and clumsy and the second you fight enemies who can outright ignore your attacks you will yell foul as they become undefeatable without very specific strategies.What the game does right is create its world and mythology where even the philsophical nature of ethics is different from our own, albiet with the standard Bioware silly morality systems. The martial arts are diverse and interesting and some even awe inspiring. Sometimes you will just want to continue with the game just to see what you will get next and that is when the game is doing its best.Overall this game is a solid 6/10 I probably most want to see done right.

												Jade Empire is a good game the highlight being that you won't get bored with the combat system and stuff, the items and upgrades are unique with a nice twist.  Ok that's the good now for the bad.  Good voice acting and some side quests.  Sometimes funny side quests.First off the game is linear with sidequests which means that you can't go arround doing whatever you want in order to get the next set of side quests you have to do the next main quest.  Also this is bioware but which is good with the romance quests but there is not that good in that it was kinda lacking compared to dragon ages 1 and 2.  You can choose between evil guy and good guy.			"

												This game is KOTOR in Little big Chinatown. It's more homage to the Chinese Marital-art house asthetic than an RPG set in a faithflly re-created Ancient China, which will hit you as soon as the Steampunk technology comes into play.If you've played the Bioware Knights franchise, this game will feel right at home to you. The dialogue system, the alignment system, the influence over companions, etc. is all inherited from the 1st game.The only serious deviation is askewing of realtime-turn-based combat, for 3rd person combat. You click, and your character attacks, you can move and manuever your character at will.There is also a shoot-em' up mini-game which, at times I think clashes with the rest of the game in tone, but otherwise is memorable where most of BIoware's mini games were either boring or insufferable.Perhaps the most memorable feature to this game? The Cast. Alot of star power arrived for this outing, Nathan Fillion, Brian Doyle Murray, Armin Shimerman, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly John Cleese, and anyone whose played adapation titles like Devil May Cry or Final Fantasy 9 or Armored Core 4 will recognize Kari Wahlgren.I honestly can't recommend this game enough, but be warned, Imperfect Customer has it right, you do need to mess with some files inorder to get the game both to work, and for your cursor (the mouse pointer) to appear.If you're experiencing this problem download this file and put it into your Jade Empire directory:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22012712/JadeEmpireLauncher.exeIt's an old Jade Empire exe renamed ""JadeEmpireLauncher"" so steam will launch it instead of the launcher which can end in error. You still need to launch the game from Steam though, clicking on it won't do anything. Your Jade Empire Directory can be found in Steam-> SteamApps -> Common-> Jade Empire.			"

												I really feel like I should bother to write a review for this game. Back in the days, I used to play this game quite a lot on my Xbox, so I was really excited when I realized that this game was also getting released on Steam. First off, let me address all the people saying that they could not get this game to run on Win7 and above. I myself also use Win7 and have played it multiple times without even a single glitch or bug. The game runs just as smoothly as it did on my console, if not even smoother. And if you had sacrificed a mere two minutes of your lives searching for a solution to the infamous ""Steam not found""-error you would be able to enjoy this game in its entirety as well. For those too thick-headed to look it up themselves: a) Either replace the JadeLauncher.exe with the JadeEmpire.exe orb) add your Steam directory as a path in Win7 (and above). It really is not that hard, guys. But enough with the whining. I came here to write a review about the game and this is what I will do. I'd really like to compose some kind of list of the pros and cons of the game but unfortunately, I cannot think of anything that'd fall into the latter category. Even though this game might not be up to the modern-day graphics standard (also meaning that there is no HD remake ... yet), the game makes up for it with an intense and engaging story, an entertaining combat system and a wide variety of different combat styles and techniques. The choice, as with many Bioware titles, is complely up to you: Whether you prefer the classic martial arts, like the brute force of a wide arsenal of different melee and (one...) ranged weapons, fancy being a ranged spellcaster or even prefer to transform into a various amount of demons to squish your foes in an instant, the game does offer you every single one of these possibilities. The choices you make on your way to your ultimate goal do, of course, affect how the story develops and how the people react to you. There are the two big classic sides of good (the so-called Way of the Open Palm) and bad (The Closed Fist). Depending on those you gain different trinkets and skills and shape the climax of the game. But you don't have to travel alone. The game helps you out with several companions, each one with an interesting back story and unique abilities. Don't like dragging someone along the whole time who is only getting in the way? It's not a problem! Almost every companion has two different ways to aid you in combat: Attack and support. But I do have to say that most of the compnions fancy you being the nice guy, so you might have a hard time dealing with them when walking the dark path. Unfortunately, there are some techniques in the game that cannot be accessed and learnt during the game (and of course, these are mostly only the cool ones). Nevertheless, some talented modder thought of a solution to this problem and released the best and most popular mod for Jade Empire: Jade in Style. If you already know the game and are looking for a little more variation in styles you should certainly check out this mod. The world of Jade Empire seems somewhat like a mashup of many different clichés of medival Asia but it really doesn't matter after the first few minutes of gameplay. Sadly, you cannot explore most areas - the game basically tells you where to go and the progression through the different areas is rather linear, especially when entering a dungeon. I'd really like to talk about its main feature - the story. But I won't because I do not want to spoil anything and I am not quite sure I would be able to say something different than ""OMG, it's so epic!!"" (you get the gist). Let me just say that the game contained the most WTF plot twist of my childhood. So, in conclusion, I'd like to say that I highly recommend this game. I have by far not talked about all the features this game offers because I feel that some things should be yours to discover.Once you get it to run, the whole experience is at least as good as it was ""in the olden days"". It even offers full (Xbox) controller support, but is just easy to play with a mouse and a keyboard (it's what I did). I hope that a few of you will not be deterred by the vast amount of negative reviews regarding the PC adaption because it really is a very good game.But go and see for yourselves!			"

												A very surprising game.  I had known about Knights of the Old Republic and the Mass Effect series, but this game completely cam out of the blue to me.  I bought it on a whim, since it was only $15 (and seeing the Bioware logo), and I have to say it's probably one of the most unique games I've played.If you haven't played it, at least give it a try.  You will likely not be dissappointed.			"

												I really feel like I should bother to write a review for this game. Back in the days, I used to play this game quite a lot on my Xbox, so I was really excited when I realized that this game was also getting released on Steam. First off, let me address all the people saying that they could not get this game to run on Win7 and above. I myself also use Win7 and have played it multiple times without even a single glitch or bug. The game runs just as smoothly as it did on my console, if not even smoother. And if you had sacrificed a mere two minutes of your lives searching for a solution to the infamous ""Steam not found""-error you would be able to enjoy this game in its entirety as well. For those too thick-headed to look it up themselves: a) Either replace the JadeLauncher.exe with the JadeEmpire.exe orb) add your Steam directory as a path in Win7 (and above). It really is not that hard, guys. But enough with the whining. I came here to write a review about the game and this is what I will do. I'd really like to compose some kind of list of the pros and cons of the game but unfortunately, I cannot think of anything that'd fall into the latter category. Even though this game might not be up to the modern-day graphics standard (also meaning that there is no HD remake ... yet), the game makes up for it with an intense and engaging story, an entertaining combat system and a wide variety of different combat styles and techniques. The choice, as with many Bioware titles, is complely up to you: Whether you prefer the classic martial arts, like the brute force of a wide arsenal of different melee and (one...) ranged weapons, fancy being a ranged spellcaster or even prefer to transform into a various amount of demons to squish your foes in an instant, the game does offer you every single one of these possibilities. The choices you make on your way to your ultimate goal do, of course, affect how the story develops and how the people react to you. There are the two big classic sides of good (the so-called Way of the Open Palm) and bad (The Closed Fist). Depending on those you gain different trinkets and skills and shape the climax of the game. But you don't have to travel alone. The game helps you out with several companions, each one with an interesting back story and unique abilities. Don't like dragging someone along the whole time who is only getting in the way? It's not a problem! Almost every companion has two different ways to aid you in combat: Attack and support. But I do have to say that most of the compnions fancy you being the nice guy, so you might have a hard time dealing with them when walking the dark path. Unfortunately, there are some techniques in the game that cannot be accessed and learnt during the game (and of course, these are mostly only the cool ones). Nevertheless, some talented modder thought of a solution to this problem and released the best and most popular mod for Jade Empire: Jade in Style. If you already know the game and are looking for a little more variation in styles you should certainly check out this mod. The world of Jade Empire seems somewhat like a mashup of many different clichés of medival Asia but it really doesn't matter after the first few minutes of gameplay. Sadly, you cannot explore most areas - the game basically tells you where to go and the progression through the different areas is rather linear, especially when entering a dungeon. I'd really like to talk about its main feature - the story. But I won't because I do not want to spoil anything and I am not quite sure I would be able to say something different than ""OMG, it's so epic!!"" (you get the gist). Let me just say that the game contained the most WTF plot twist of my childhood. So, in conclusion, I'd like to say that I highly recommend this game. I have by far not talked about all the features this game offers because I feel that some things should be yours to discover.Once you get it to run, the whole experience is at least as good as it was ""in the olden days"". It even offers full (Xbox) controller support, but is just easy to play with a mouse and a keyboard (it's what I did). I hope that a few of you will not be deterred by the vast amount of negative reviews regarding the PC adaption because it really is a very good game.But go and see for yourselves!			"

												I originally owned this on the xbox and completed it at least three times. It's a great RPG and incredibly underrated. The story is a bit cliche but fun and the combat is excellent. One could argue that this game with the real time combat was a blue print for what Bioware would eventually do in the upcoming Mass Effect games. I love this game and wish more people could get into it...unfortunately the steam version doesn't do this title any favors. I cannot recommend this title through steam as it is a hassle to get working. There are several steps you have to go through just to get the damn game to load. Once that's done you may experience problems with in game cut scenes and the music going out of sync. After about 30 minutes of editing and doing some homework through google I got everything working, but the fact that people need to go through all this effort is  totally stupid. I also noticed that you can play the game with the gamepad. I gave it a shot for nostalgia, and it's functional but the auto targeting system is a mess. For any newcomers interested in this title, unless you're willing to take a chance and have some decent PC skills, try and give it a shot, but only if the game is dirt cheap on sale. For everyone else, I've been told the GOG version of Jade Empire runs fine without any problems, so you may want to check them out instead. Steam really needs to pay more attention to the games it offers its customers.  "

												If you are a fan of Fable or Knights of the Old Republic, you will definitely enjoy this game.For starters, the combat has a very Fable Like feel. Same as the non-open world aspect of it, which I personally enjoy. It's easy to know where you've explored and what you've accomplished. Also, the map markers which indicate where you need to go or where the individual you must seek out are very easy to understand.The dialogue is exactly how Knights of the Old Republic works. The main story is very well done and it keeps you wanting more, the downside is your companions. I didn't feel as connected or as interested in them as I did with the Old Republic. I felt Bioware let us down very much in that aspect. There are few times were you can really even talk to each individual member. Also, the fact you only get one companion at a time adds to that. Romancing, also. I enjoyed that quite a bit in Old Repulic because I felt a deeper connection between the characters. Word of advice, be VERY careful of what you say. I said one wrong thing early in the game and ruined my chances completely. Overall, if you're looking for a deeper connection towards the individual characters, you will not, imo, be as concerned with these guys as in KotOR. That being said, it is good on it's own merits.Dialogue, some of the dialogue is very tedious and made me lose interest. It didn't have to much to do with the story at times and the lore was subpar. The documents and scrolls which you read are the main highlights in opinion. Very well written and nicely done.The combat is awesome. It takes a bit to get used too, but once you do it's a breeze. Multiple styles to learn make it quite an enjoyable experience. Also, leveling is a lot simpler as well. I simply balanced every time I leveled and all the gems I received by the end of the game made it a cake walk.The lack of changing armor was a bit dissapointing and really lacked customization. Also weapons, though there are an abundant of fighting styles. Weapons are almost next to non-existent. That is one thing you have to look out for when leveling, your skill points. If you waste the few you get throughout the game on a weapon you won't use much later, you will have quite a bit of trouble.Now the story. It consists of 7 chapters. The first 4 chapters are very thoroughly done and constists of an abundant amount of side quests, which in all reality, aren't too important. They mainly give you pointless gems that are much too weak. It's even worse if you are Open Palm, because you're not taking any rewards. After 4, all side quests drop immedietaly. They are very rushed and seemed to cram all the story into those last 3, so it kind of feels like you are being jipped out of content. Again comparing it to the Old Republic, the worlds on that game were huge and provided quite a bit of content. There are only 3 villages you visit in this game, and almost no one to talk to beside quest givers.Overall, for what it is, it's wonderful. The Old Republic scaled down with a different way of combat, much like Fable. The story has it's twists and turns but feels rushed towards the end. The lack of connection I felt to the characters was a bit upsetting but the wonderful graphics of it's time and smooth gameplay, especially during fights make up for it. It's a good 15-25 hour game and replay value is great especially if you want to go Open Palm or Closed Fist.			"

												If you like Bioware-style RPGs, definitely consider getting this game--especially if it's on sale. A lot of folks have been complaining about being unable to run the game, but there are a number of fixes for the issue listed online. I initially had the same problem, but after running the game as an administrator and fiddling around with a few of the game's settings, I was able to get the game working and haven't had any problems since.As far as the game goes, the level design is impressive--many of the areas still look nice, despite the outdated graphics. The dialogue can be hokey at times, and it's important to keep in mind that the game is not at all an accurate representation of Chinese culture and narrative. The levelling and customization system is not as deep as other RPG's, but overall combat is fun and more oriented toward the Action RPG genre than KOTOR. There's a really excellent mod called Jade Empire In Style that adds a lot more depth to the game's combat and customization system if players feel like the vanilla version isn't satisfying enough. The story, while far from perfect and full of cliches, is good enough to keep the player engaged and interested in what will happen next. My biggest complaint about the game mechanics is the morality system--it is apparent that Bioware was attempting to make a morality system that was less about good vs. evil, and more about whether or not the ends justify the means. If this system were to have been implemented correctly, it would be possible to take the path of the ""closed fist"" without being an evil jerk. Unfortunately, despite a fair amount of dialogue in the game about how neither ""path"" is inherently evil, it's not really possible to follow the way of the closed fist without being a really terrible excuse for a human being.Right now I'm far from beating the game, so I can't comment on the ending, but despite it's flaws it's been a very enjoyable RPG.

												One thing I love about video games is their ability to make me feel special. In this world where most of us are - face it - pretty ordinary, it's great to be able to spend some time in a fictional place where you feel like you are truly making a difference. And in Jade Empire, this is not just a feeling that dawns on you when the credits start rolling. It's there from the very first minutes, and stays with you throughout the game.Jade Empire is a typical, if slightly aged BioWare RPG. You can play the game in different ways depending on your preferences, and there are plenty of interesting characters to interact with. I wasn't too fond of a few companions initially, but they ended up growing on me. By the end of the game, I was happy to have all of them by my side.On the downside, I ran into a bug that made the camera point at the floor a little more often than I'd like. This seemed to happen randomly and was pretty effective at breaking my immersion, but it could be fixed by saving and reloading.This game is not as famous as most other BioWare RPGs (think SW:KOTOR, Mass Effect or Dragon Age), but it is interesting and unique in its own way, especially due to the Asian setting. Although not quite at the level of those blockbuster games, Jade Empire is more than worth your time.			"

I have an XP and a 7, and the game works just fine on the XP. Although you may run into a config error starting the game up, but it has an easy fix. Just go to the Jade Empire folder and rename the launcher to ""JadeEmpireLauncherBackup"", and then rename the Jade Empire .exe to ""JadeEmpireLauncher"", and thats all. The game so far is quite worth it. If you've ever played Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic I and II, it has very similar gameplay to that.			"

												A gem of an Old Bioware game! I had no idea before I actually tried it. I have no idea any longer why I hadn't tried it and I can only wonder why it hasn't meritted more attention as an intellectual property.The story, pacing, and other such plot elements are, to my taste, legit in comparison to other Old Bioware titles like Knights of the Old Republic and Baldur's Gates. Happily, it was one of those RPG stories I was not expecting to get caught up in and which I was memorably rapt and engaged to explore my first playthrough. Several of the side characters are memorable, the rest being amply adequate, and the romance subplots are nice enough. Appreciable world building polishes like an original language are interesting and, in my opinion, respectable artistic investments. For RPG completionists, there is to be divined (I have done so) a long enough but not too long set of missable items, etc.,  to hunt up. Certainly the character customization and development available here is nothing to Neverwinter Nights (and the same are far and away the most attractive aspects of NWN) and the martial arts dynamics are (presumably) little match for actual fighting games. But I found both highly satisfying in their simplicity. It's a sweetly elegant and intuitive simplicity, not an underwhelming simplicity, in my opinion, and to the extent that I reckon it a major asset of the design.Overall, I've continually considered Jade Empire an unique and highly pleasant flavor to occasionally crave.Get the mod Jade Empire in Style! With it and its rebalance in favor of proficiency in numerous styles, my replayability has gained significantly from the opportunity to gain more and finer combat skills through assessing the complements of combinations of single styles. I.e., trying the general pros and cons of the several main styles was interesting enough for several plays through, and with the expanded style list trying the very finest nuances of the combined pros and cons of switching several styles dynamically in battle is much stimulating, for me.

												This game wonderful example of Bioware's talents before they united with EA and an awesome game if you can get it running. I have played this on the original Xbox and I did have a copy on PC before it was stolen. Thankfully a friend got me this awesome game for Christmas but unfortunately it refuses to work on Windows 8.1 without a LOT of messing around. I am going to have to give it a thumbs down simply for the fact that I had to fiddle with it for ages to even get it working.  I know it was cheap in the Steam sale but that is no excuse for this not running on today's hard and software. It should not be up for sale if it can't work on current PCs. I doubt there are any plans for them to update this game to stop the problems.			"

I felt that combat and general navigation was very awkward and unsatisfying, and that the overall experience was bland and unremarkable.  Perhaps this was effectively a better title back in the day when it came out, relative to its competitors, but I say take a pass on this and hit some of the better CRPG's: Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate 2, and Dragon Age: Origins, just to name a few.

												Jade Empire is an immersive 3rd person game with an emphasis on story and martial arts - themed combat. JE was published and developed by BioWare, which many may recognize as the company under EA which is known to deliver on immersive, story rich games which often include innovative gameplay mechanics, such as the Mass Effect or Dragon Age series. Jade Empire is no exception, as the fighting is very rewarding and, surprisingly, does not get repetitive nearly as fast as you might expect it to. Different martial arts styles are very distinctive from one another, although certain martial arts and weapon styles outshine others, which means most players may opt out of changing styles due to the success they have with a certain one. Decision-making is a pivotal part of the game. The decisions you make will branch the story out to a certain extent, affect how characters react to you and also affect the ending too. Jade Empire's story is long and immersive. You take the role of a student in a martial arts school lead by your mentor, Master Li. You can choose your character from a selection of different toons, either going with a pre-selected loadout (Starting styles and stats, like in many MMORPGs) or making your own loadout. Your own character isn't voice acted, which is a shame, but it's not that big of a deal. Jade Empire is quite a long game and it takes you through various cities, villages and wildernesses throughout China. The game has a companion system, which lets you be accompanied by one character out of many others who you meet on your journey. You can switch out companions at nearly any time you wish, as they all follow you during your journey in the background. (Appearing in a camp when not selected). The story takes many turns and if you are into Chinese mythology or history, you will definitely enjoy Jade Empire. The game is a bit old, but it is not it's fault and I still warmly recommend it to anyone. It requires some patience from the player to listen to the narrative and get immersed in the story, as all BioWare games do anyway. In my opinion, the combat is very fun and rewarding, as for some bosses and enemies you really have to plan ahead and switch styles during the fight in order to survive. The characters and the plot are what shine in the game the most for me. Some provide comic relief, some provide moral guidance for the decisions you must make during your journey, and some work to intrigue you and astonish you. My favorite character is hands down is Henpecked Hou, an awkward chef who acts as comic relief by complaining about how he will get beat up by his wife and who also provides a unique drunken martial style by throwing wine bottles at you during combat. A great guy indeed.All in all, there is only one thing that I can think of that Jade Empire really, really needs. A sequel. Seriously. The game has a great story as long as you have the patience to play through it. The game is great and the main factor that makes it great is that there aren't many games like it out here in Steam.

												A classic Bioware title, in the mould of Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect. This is probably the most original RPG I've played; they created their own universe loosely based on the myths of ancient China and Japan, and invented a language with it. The musical score is absolutely beautiful too. As for the story, you can decide to be good or evil, or something in between, and the decisions you make impact the ending as well as what happens to the characters you meet.			"

												Brilliant RPG with engaging story, fascinating setting and compelling characters. It's maybe one of the less known games by BioWare but it's no less deserving. Any BioWare fan -and anyone who enjoys a well written immersive RPG, with the bonus of a world different from the ""classic"" medieval fantasy- should definitely play it.On the tech side some minor problems (playing on Windows 8) but not impossible to fix.

												Quality Bioware from a time before EA. The game plays and unfolds in a typical bioware (back then bioware) fashion with the same sort of humble beginings and story twists you would hope to be suprised by. They are effective in making an Asian-influenced world with a fun and unique combat system based on real-time kung-fu combos and a sort of chi magic. Overall, it feels like an experiment for trying out many of the features and ideas they would make into Knights of the Old Republic. While feeling more shallow than KOTOR it still manages to entertain and should'nt be missed if you liked the original KOTOR or like kung-fu movies.			"

												Jade Empire is an immersive 3rd person game with an emphasis on story and martial arts - themed combat. JE was published and developed by BioWare, which many may recognize as the company under EA which is known to deliver on immersive, story rich games which often include innovative gameplay mechanics, such as the Mass Effect or Dragon Age series. Jade Empire is no exception, as the fighting is very rewarding and, surprisingly, does not get repetitive nearly as fast as you might expect it to. Different martial arts styles are very distinctive from one another, although certain martial arts and weapon styles outshine others, which means most players may opt out of changing styles due to the success they have with a certain one. Decision-making is a pivotal part of the game. The decisions you make will branch the story out to a certain extent, affect how characters react to you and also affect the ending too. Jade Empire's story is long and immersive. You take the role of a student in a martial arts school lead by your mentor, Master Li. You can choose your character from a selection of different toons, either going with a pre-selected loadout (Starting styles and stats, like in many MMORPGs) or making your own loadout. Your own character isn't voice acted, which is a shame, but it's not that big of a deal. Jade Empire is quite a long game and it takes you through various cities, villages and wildernesses throughout China. The game has a companion system, which lets you be accompanied by one character out of many others who you meet on your journey. You can switch out companions at nearly any time you wish, as they all follow you during your journey in the background. (Appearing in a camp when not selected). The story takes many turns and if you are into Chinese mythology or history, you will definitely enjoy Jade Empire. The game is a bit old, but it is not it's fault and I still warmly recommend it to anyone. It requires some patience from the player to listen to the narrative and get immersed in the story, as all BioWare games do anyway. In my opinion, the combat is very fun and rewarding, as for some bosses and enemies you really have to plan ahead and switch styles during the fight in order to survive. The characters and the plot are what shine in the game the most for me. Some provide comic relief, some provide moral guidance for the decisions you must make during your journey, and some work to intrigue you and astonish you. My favorite character is hands down is Henpecked Hou, an awkward chef who acts as comic relief by complaining about how he will get beat up by his wife and who also provides a unique drunken martial style by throwing wine bottles at you during combat. A great guy indeed.All in all, there is only one thing that I can think of that Jade Empire really, really needs. A sequel. Seriously. The game has a great story as long as you have the patience to play through it. The game is great and the main factor that makes it great is that there aren't many games like it out here in Steam.

It has recently been released on GOG where you can get it and actually play the game.As Far as the game goes this is a really well told BioWare story RPG. Unique characters and a good combat system and skills made it all the more complete. This series is worthy of a sequel but the BioWare of this age now probably wouldn't do a good job of it.

												This game is one of Bioware's earlier RPGs before Mass Effect and Dragon Age modern fame.  Like a lot of developers, all their works share similar themes.  Good characterization, good humor, binary good / evil (although in this case its styled differently), good voice acting, etc.  The setting and music are characterization are all good and very well enjoyable, and quite amusing at times.  Bioware is very good at that, and I applaud them.The problem with the game is that the actual -game- portion is just not very fun.  The combat is downright awful because there is no balance or flow.  Most enemies could be button-mashed to death, and those that can't usually have some sort of rediculous advantage over the player such as no hitstun, extremely high damage, or extremely high health.  There are two types of MP, one for magic + healing and the other for weapons + bullet time... but considering that there is no other way to restore your health aside from generous cutscenes I can't see magic being useful.  Leveling up a weapon style makes it use almost no MP but bullet time drains MP like pouring water out of a cup.  Animations are VERY clunky and often uncancelable, and each style only has one combo and one guardbreak attack.  Controlling your character in fights is a pain because being locked on to an enemy makes you extremely slow, and free camera makes it impossible to hit enemies reliably.Levelling up gives points to spend in combat styles and other points to spend on stats, but there's no way to really know if you're going to get a good style later down the line and spent points are permanent.  Its a pitfall of RPGs, not knowing how well-spent your resources are because of a lack of transparency in the system.  Luckily stats are more easily corrected as you can swap equipment to boost the little used conversation stats and your primary stats, but nothing boosts your damage or defense directly.There are scant few puzzles in the game that really only pad or are otherwise obnoxious (get out a pen and paper because you'll need to memorize), and a seemingly pointless Galaga minigame that occurs often and produces no non-Galage related rewards.The game runs fine on Win7 / HD6850 / 3.2GHz * 6 / 8gb RAM system.  Its was made for the original XBOX and it shows, but the game controls perfectly fine on PC as a port even in the few fixed camera scenes.  I'd say pass on the game unless you like Bioware titles or the asian setting.  The combat in the game holds the whole package back far too much to be a robust title.  It's not worth suffering through for the story, which is only okay, even if well presented.			"

												I am writing this review for the Steam Awards badge. this does not make my review any less true, merely horribly overdue.I nominated Jade Empire for the custom category Hiddem Gem, because it is one. When it was first released it received great reviews, but the sales figures never matched that, probably because it was new and different.It is set in an Asian setting and draws heavily on eastern mythology. Then it allows you to beat said mythology up with magic, martial arts (including backflips and other acrobatic stunts) and several weapons. Or you can choose to talk it out in true RPG fashion. It also has a morality system with two sides that are not exactly good or evil, but more like yin and yang. Nobody will really judge you for it either since the way of the Closed Fist and the way of the Open Palm are established philosophies within the game. If you feel bad or uncomfortable making some of the choices then maybe one of those philosophies is just not for you.I found the story to be ok. It goes on for longer than I expected the first time and if you take the time to look for them it actually has several interesting little tidbits hidden away. This includes the possibility of beating up a ""British"" person.Give it a try.			"

												Jade Empire has to be one of my favorite games to play.  Yes, the port to PC is not perfect, but it's workable for the most part (it took a lot of uninstalling and reinstalling to finally get it to play), but it' a great game.  The story is fantastic and the setting is just beautiful.  Imagine what it would look like in HD.  I come back to this game time and time again because I fell in love with the characters and the story.  The combat is fun and not too challenging.  Give it a shot is my suggestion.			"

												The Controls for this games, specifically when it comes to the camera and movement, are designed for a WASD game like World of Warcraft, and not at all like they were on the original XBOX. People are saying that the GOG port is better, but they havent specified whether it fixes this issue or not. I would suggest avoiding the pc port of this game altogether, unfortunately. Perhaps they will fix is one day, if enough returns are made, But it's unlikely. Better look for a hard copy while you can.			"

												One of the unsung greatest games ever made. More than any game I have played, I wish there could have been more, and I wish they had made another one. The gameplay is natural and just challenging enough to keep you paying attention (which is how most Bioware games seem to go), the Asian setting is vibrant, and it has a passable ""choice-based"" system that would later be fleshed out in the Mass Effect games. All in all, a great game.I notice a lot of people saying the game doesn't work on PC -- I didn't have any problems myself.			"

												BioWare's unique take on eastern fantasy. While it is easy to decry this game for stereotyping, that detracts from the overall discussion of this game touching an area we almost never saw in the west, when it was released. Now of course we have a much broader range of games that look at eastern fantasy, but this game still holds up today for its storytelling, and well thought out gameplay.			"

												Don't be fooled by the playtime; I've played the xbox version.Jade Empire is such an underrated game and as Bioware's first original IP, it deserves a bit more respect. It doesn't have anything on a lot of their other games, sure, but I have good memories. I had a great story, great characters and an interesting setting for an RPG. The only minor complaints I have is that the PC version is a little buggy in comparison to the xbox version (and I played this game on a 360 with backwards compatibility too). Also, it requires a little tweaking to get it working on modern operating systems. But other than that, it's good. And if you've never played it before, it's never too late to try.			"

												This isn't a bad game. I didn't really know that it was met with luke-warm feelings by gamers far and wide. I watched someone play it initially, and I thought it was pretty cool. It ran pretty badly on my computer, but the glitches aren't game breaking; mostly just a minor irritation as you would have to reload to get the game to work again. However, the storyline isn't uninteresting. The graphics aren't entirely bad. It was fun and I played it through pretty quickly - and the themes of the story are pretty neat (the ghosts being restless, the water dragon's powers, etc.). However, you don't get to know your team very well and the fact that only one of them can follow you around is a little bit of a bummer. You can't really customize your character at all and it felt kind of 'meh' to me, too. Still, worth playing if you can get it on sale and you can get it to work.			"

												Played this a long time ago back when people still had original xboxes. My ex-uncle somehow managed to modify his xbox, so that it could download xbox games like they were roms. Had absolute fun playing it back then, and playing it again years later, I still feel the same about the game. Although dialogue changes are minor for each character, the game is fun enough to have plenty of replay value, even though I always end up pairing up with Dawn Star or Silk Fox.Shame Bioware never got the series to take off, or to my knowledge, produce a similar feudal era in their games. But to be honest, and as of writing, this is like the only Bioware game I've ever palyed.			"

												This is the game that got me into Bioware games. I have very fond memories playing this countless times on my original Xbox. The main story is well writen and the world beautiful. The characters and the majority of the side quests are interesting.  If you are a John Cleese fan, he does have a cameo in the game in one of the side quests. It still looks great on my computer as it did when I first played it on my original Xbox. I personaly feel, combat itself is what hurts it however. Each of the fighting styles has one heavy attack and one light attack with the same blocking animation, with no real combos. This can make the combat feel boring at times if you are only using one or two fighting styles. You will be wanting to increase the number of fighting styles and hotkeying them so it does not feel as repetitive.       I do prefer this version on my PC since the load times are not as bad as the version on my Xbox. However this copy took me a while to get it to work on my computer. I had to go threw countless troubleshooting and work arounds but eventualy I did get it to work.If you are a Bioware fan and enjoy RPG's I can easily recommend this game even though I went threw hell trying to get it to work.  It is a shame that this game is considered to be a commercial flop since I feel that it should have done better when it first came out.			"

Won't say it's worth 15€ (even though it's so good, it's an old game, at most it'd be worth 10€), so get it on sale if you can.
