												Dear child,Tuck yourself in and listen to what I have to say.It is for those too, who have doubts with Uplay.When I first heard that a third party program needs to be installed,I thought 'It's too much a bother to be buying this at all'.But I was in love with the game as I was with Odin Sphere,so I researched and researched until all doubts were clear.It seems that Uplay has improved over the years,as told by a friend whom I very love so dear.After registering I instantly unravelledthat once I ticked 'auto login' it is never a hassle.Switch Uplay to offline mode so it won’t meddle.As confused as I was along the way,thorough research finally made me payand playing this game now makes my day.Child of Light is like a delightful bedtime story.You play as a little girl, very cute and dandy,though her arms are a little bit wobblyto be carrying a sword both sharp and pointy.What I really appreciate is the effort that they tookto make each and every sentence look so good.The beautiful world of Lemuria will captivate your eyes,with beautifully matched music as you zip through the sky.Bottom line be told,This game is made of gold.I did not regret buying it a single bit,and I’m writing this so that your path may be lit.Godspeed.

												Beautiful art with a hand painted looklike it was taken right from a children's book.Fantastic music sets the tonewhile our princess tries to regain her throne.And while the story might be simpleits as cute as a childs dimple.The battle system is quite well donemaking every fight a lot of fun.Attack, magic and even defense!Using tactics just makes sense.Though if you dislike my rhyming tonethen I would leave this game alone.

EssenceIf you want to play something that has amazing style, is über-cute without being childish in the wrong way, is a light platformer combined, very light puzzler, with a light rpg element with simple yet still interesting enough turn based combat in the style of Final Fantasy and many other games, then this is exactly what you have been waiting for. Especially for the low original price they're selling this gem on release - must be the best spent money pixel-for-pixel in it's genre.Child of Light is perhaps one of the best entry points I have encountered for many aspects of computer gaming, all wrapped up in an exclusive sheet of paper with close to perfect execution.SessionMe and an unexperienced friend that does not play computergames, 30 years old, played CoL for 6h straight. While being an avid gamer/developer myself I enjoy introducing other people to new experiences in the world of games, hence I controlled the wisp while he/she controlled the protagonist in a local co-op using gamepads on a 55"". We played the win-version from Steam.GOODVisualsCoL's style is a hand crafted treat for the eyes and looks like something taken directly from a printed high quality western fairy tale. While not for everyone the cuteness, fluidity and richly illustrated world will make most people instantly fall in love with what is presented: The aestehtics do not leave much to wish for. LanguageCoL is also written in the style of a rhyming childs book, which is just adorable.SoundVoice acting in form of story teller between certain events sound very good and fit right in. Voice acting is however not there for character dialogues, but the game does not suffer from it. Music is high-quality and well integrated with the mood of the scenes. DLCMany that seem to know nothing about the game are whining about there being DLC:s released for it already and call it a rip off. Be insured that this is not the case at this current time.The DLC:s are not win-to-pay or antything that is actually needed or improves the game or it's flaws in any way. Some of the are cosmetics, while others give you basic stuff you are free to very easily find in game through exploration used to buff your stats. Exploration is natural and not tedious or a punishment. I'd even claim that it's the other way around. (Compare it with if Nintendo  started to sell mushrooms for super mario games...)Lastly there is also one DLC that actually adds a quest and an unlockable party member: It is great that this is offered for those deeming it worthy and interesting to have that option. Yes, they could have incorporated all of this for the original price in the initial release of the game, but they didn't, maybe in order to cover for the low price of the game, or maybe because all of it is not needed at all in the game. Needless to say, the argument that x could be included since the start can always be used no matter how much the devs have put in originally. It seems people never get enough and also always complain when somebody offers options which they themselves are supposedly not intersted in.LESS GOODThe following points will not matter for the general publich that will play this game: The target group for CoL is not role playing nerds like myself coming from Dungeons & Dragons et.c. With that written, this might still be of interest for those of us that are experienced gamers as we will surely notice:EasyCoL is easy for experienced platyers if played on the casual difficulty setting: You can relax while playing and still enjoy it, but won't get any feel of urgency until you are at least more than eight hours into the storyline. There is however an option to change the difficulty to expert. For non-gamers the casual settings is perfect though.ManualThe manual is minimalistic, takes 3 minutes to read, and explains only the very basics that you would figure out yourself within a maximum of an hour of gameplay anyhow. It does not explain the more technical aspects of the game, like for example questions in the style of:""What is the size limits of a party?""""How is xp divided between party members if they (don't) participate in combat?""""How else is xp earned?""""What's the limitation in quality of what can be crafted?""My guess is developers don't care with manuals since the assume, quite correctly, that most people will never even open them and that the need of them is somewhat negated by in-game tutorials. While true to some extent, manuals are still something that I believe that we as gamers should demand when purchasing a game.MapThe quality of the in game map does not match the aesthetics or overall design of the rest of the game, nor is it's function sufficient even if the game isn't a maze or grandiose scope. It lacks local maps, zoom, and pretty much everythin you'd expect except fasttravel.Co-op: Local onlyWhy, oh why, is this not playble via the net when it's released 2014? Granted it wouldn't be used as a uniqe selling point, but still: If co-op is put in it should also offer the mode via the net even if playing with a person next to you is usually a nicer experience, should one be so lucky to have a gaming partner with the time and desire.Co-op: PassivityThe second player controlling the wisp has a clearly defined support role: He/she can heal, slow enemies, reach spaces easier, and is also indestructible. Issue is that the wisp seems to originally be an extended function of the main character. It works excellent when being playing it as single player and adds to the game, but when another player is expected to control the wisp he/she will in most cases feel somewhat limited and passive in relation to player 1 that controls the princess. Hence I do not recommend any gamer to actually play as the wisp.On the other hand, this could also be a good thing if one wants to introduce a person to the world of games - letting them play a limited role will not overwhelm them, and can maybe lead to more curiosity and the urge to control the main character instead eventually.Party sizeWhen in turn based combat mode you never control more than 2 characters (ok, 3 including the semi-passive wisp..) from your party even  in cases where your party size exceeds that number. There is also a similar limitation to the amount of enemies you may encounter at the same time. Part of this is solvable by the function that allows you to call in and swap out one party member for another during any point in the combat (will count as an action though), so there is still ways to adapt and save party members.I'm not sure this has to be something bad even though I am sure many will percieve it that way. Personally I don't think ""more of the same"" and quantities of anything improves a game. In part the limited hero pool in combat even encourages the wiser use of tactics.U-playYups, you need to have it installed. Steam is not enough. Only thing good with this is that you will actually unlock extra fluff and game content in UPlay for the game by just playing it and completing quests.			"

												Rustling through the beginning, with there already little details of hidden nooks and crannies, this game is astounding. I've only just begun and after the first boss it becomes so poignant I almost shed a tear. Fantastic writing on the poetic side. Beautiful animations. I cannot wait to get even further into the game. For the price this is a steal and a must play for any storytelling/poetry lovers and rpg fans (and even with a little girl as the protagonist I am enjoying the hell out of this)			"

Child of Light Review""The Princess of Lemuria""Child of Light is a RPG produced by Ubisoft Montreál, released in April of 2014. In this game you embark in a journey, playing as Aurora, a young princess whose soul is brought to the Kingdom of Lemuria. On this journey, you will have to recover the three sources of light and defeat the Black Queen in order to restore the Kingdom of Lemuria.GameplayIn terms of gameplay it is a good game but nothing impressive. The combat mechanics are pretty simple. However, you need to think you actions well in order to act in the best and fastest way as possible. At the start you will be a ""lone wolf"", but with time you will find many interesting and strong allies which will help you, by forming a party of 2 characters during the battles. You also have a firefly as an ally, which you control with the mouse. A pretty interesting mechanic but it becomes pretty repetitive during the combats. Out of combat it is an simple 2D platform game, with some puzzles, traps and tons of hidden loot. Sadly, in terms of combat, the game becomes extremely repetitive in the second half of the game because at some point, excluding boss battles, you will repeat the same tactics over and over again since the variety of enemies is pretty low. It gets so repetitive that at some point, you will start avoiding your enemies instead of attacking them to earn experience. You also have a perk system, as expected in a RPG, which is also pretty simple, yet intuitive. There is also a gem system called Oculi, that gives you the chance to upgrade certain stats of your characters.

StoryThe story in this game is told in an extremely simple way, yet that is part of the beauty of it. It is a very sad story with some unexpected plot twists, supported by excellent characters and good dialogues, except the fact that they always rhyme, something that really grinded my gears, especially during the second half of the game because the rhymes start to feel too forced. Apart from that, it is an excellent tale of the journey made by the protagonist Aurora, in her attempt to save the Kingdom of Lemuria.VisualsVisually this is an epic game. The game art is absolutely astonishing, it really gives life to this wonderful fantasy world. Everything as an immaculate aspect, it is hard not to like the artistic work made in this game. Another highlight is the fact that this game as the ""feeling"" that all was hand crafted, as if the game was drawn on a canvas. Really spectacular in this category.

LongevityI completed the game in about 9 hours, completing the main quest and almost all secondary quests (except one if I am not mistaken). It is not much for an RPG, yet this is one unique experience, with an indie feeling and reduced price. There is hundreds of loot and many other collectibles spread all over the world, so if you intend to complete the game at 100%, you should take around 12 hours.Music and SoundsBut for me, the biggest strength in this game is the soundtrack. Absolutely amazing! The soundtrack combined with the art style of this game earn the price of admission by itself. It is hard to not be immersed in this awesome world with this wonderful combo of visuals and sounds. Simply astonishing.

												This is a beautiful and fantastic game, but I cannot recommend due to Uplay.Dear Ubisoft,I see that you read these reviews because you have responded to a few.  I want you guys to look at something.  This game has 93% positive reviews, 420 reviews are negative.I read through at least 100 negative reviews and I couldn't find one complaining about something other than Uplay.Do you not realize that if this game was offered without Uplay, the user reviews would be at least in the 98% if not higher??  This game would be listed along side games such as Portal, and Half-Life 2 when someone searched by user reviews!If you guys are doing so well as a company that you don't need that extra advertising, well that's fine.  But if you want to continue to grow as a company, you should realize that your poorly made user interface is the bane of several (otherwise) popular games, and that people don't like it.  They don't dislike it because its bad (although it is) but because THEY ALREADY HAVE ONE.  THIS IS ON STEAM.  THE LEADING DIGITAL VIDEO GAME DISTRIBUTOR.  ARE YOU HIGH??  DO YOUR CEO'S SIT IN THEIR IVORY TOWERS DESIGNING NEW WAYS TO DESTROY THE TOM CLANCY FRANCHISE AND HOW THEY CAN MAKE THE UPLAY INTERFACE LESS INTUITIVE? OR DO THEY EVER LOOK AT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND REALIZE THE CUSTOMERS ARE BEGINNING TO SHUN THEM??end rant.Signed,An Ex-Ubisoft Fan.			"

												Child of Light is an RPG reminiscent of the JRPG genre, but with beautiful 2D visuals. A tender and linear game with simple controls but deep systems.(Visuals)One of the selling points of CoL is certainly its artsy visuals, masterfully implemented on the UbiArt framework, the same from Rayman Origins and Legends. The landscapes vary from dark sceneries to rivers of lava, but one thing that remains constant is the extremely high quality of the artwork invested onto all moments of normal gameplay and battle.(Systems)The battle system is a very strong point of this game. Typical strategies from JRPGs are present, with strength or defense buffs and elemental weaknesses, but there is a huge focus on timing here. In a system similar to the ATB from classic Final Fantasies, allies and enemies need to wait until their icon reaches the casting bar to choose an action. The interesting part is that while the character is casting, its action can be cancelled by hitting it with an attack. Making the system even more deep, you can slow one or the other enemy by keeping your mouse pressed on it, to adjust things to your favor. This battle system demands a lot of focus and strategy to optimize your performance, and that is why I liked it so much.(Story)The story is told in a very poetic way, and I consider it very soothing.The narrative is made in form of poems: every single dialog in the game rhymes. It seems that bothered some people, but that didn't happen to me.(Conclusion)Its best points are the very well executed art style and the battle system, but the rest has close to no flaws too. If I had to name a flaw, I would say that CoL lacks the learning of new skills to expand the explorability of the overworld, like in a metroidvania game.			"

Child. Tuck yourself in bedAnd let me tell a storyOf Lemuria, a long lost kingdom,And a girl born for glory.__________________________I'm just AMAZED at the amount of the love, care and attention that was so clearly poured into it. Child of Light FULLY grabbed me from the first minutes because of its SUPERB music and art style. The art design and sound is MAGNIFICENT, the combat is elementary and fun. The game is so NICE crafted you could easily find yourself lost in playing it for only enjoying the FABULOUS scenery. The story is FANTASTIC, the characters feel lively in this, they were actual characters you cared about through their backgrounds. The art style is very BEAUTIFUL, all the characters are  IRREPROACHABLE designed for the setting they're placed within like paintings on a canvas and the story's like a page-turner. It features STUNNING graphics, a PERFECTLY blended score and voice acting far SUPERIOR to most games. The music is GORGEOUS and the voice acting is some of the BEST I've ever heard. Overall the game is a MASTERPIECE and I recommend it to be played by anyone and especially RPG fans. There's GREAT gameplay, graphics, music, and HEART here, and I have no reservations whatsoever in wholeheartedly recommending it to anyone that enjoys these kinds of games. A game this polished, creative and entertaining to not be played would be a crime.Wait wait, it cost just $15 USD!? You MUST buy this undoubted masterpiece.I am sure this can be one of best JRPG up to recently.[10 of 10]Highly recommend! "

												Child of Light is a tribute to JRPG which has a beautiful presentation, lovely soundtrack but lacks a soul in many other aspects. I really wanted to like this game but the more I played, the more I discovered that something(s) were missing and was left hugely disappointed by the end of the game.Pros- The art style is top notch.- The soundtrack is top notch and sets the mood with its melancholic undertones.- Story is simple but cheerful and gloomy at times.- Boss battles test how well you understand the combat.Cons- Requires Uplay, if you hate it, you'll still hate it. It causes the game to become unresponsive at times and can lead to crashes.- Rhyming gets tiresome midway through the game. It's not horrible but it'll grind your gears if you grow tired of it so much so you'd wish they'd stop.- The battle system is just a shallow copy of the Grandia system and can be easily 'cheesed' with little thought for tactics and gets repetitive fairly quickly.- Combat is a mixed bag. It's fun early on but get extremely repetitive in the latter half. Early on I found myself willing to get into fights however later on I found myself avoiding it. That's a major red flag for anyone who considers combat to be the main aspect of a JRPG.- RNG is on the enemy's side as they get their 'chance' skills in regularity while you seldom get yours.- The characters 'classes' are too situational or down right useless. The most useful characters are Aurora (Light), Rubella (Damage dealer, health mage), Finn (Elemental mage), Trista (Damage dealer, protection mage) everyone else is just not good.- Party line up is too limiting, I often found myself repeating the same steps when it came to battles ad-infinitum. 1. Open up with Rubella, followed by Aurora, then stagger with Rubella and finish with Aurora, rinse and repeat or 2. Open up with Rubella, followed by Aurora, then stagger with Rubella, Aurora dies\get criticalled, switch out Rubella for Tristan, Revive or heal Aurora, switch back to Rubella, rinse and repeat. It almost feels like the game is begging for a 3 man line-up to spice things up and reduce the tedium of the constant switcheroo game. As it stands it's tedious to switch out members because they don't fit the situation.- The platforming controls aren't that great, running feels clunky and flying feels extremely stiff. It would've been wonderful if players were given the option of controlling Aurora with the dpad rather than the stick as using the stick just feels off for a 2d game with side-scrolling aspects.- Gems\Oculi are not a fully thought out idea, it's like a shallow copy of the Materia system from FF7 just not as good. 3 gems can be socketed into a character for attack, defence and talisman granting some actual or chance bonuses however they don't feel like a necessity or rarely pay off. 3 gems can be combined into one large gem which offers greater benefit but you often don't have enough gems to make large ones as they're hardly given out until near the end of the game. Oversights- Can't reorganise your party line up outside of combat. If you made a mistake and one of your favoured members dies and had to be swapped out there's no way to swap until your next battle...this is stupid.Nitpicks- Aurora's model doesn't fit the game at all. While it looks good it just doesn't mesh well with the visuals as it looks too 3d almost as if it was made to stand out from the others and looks odd.- Gems\Oculi are rarely given throughout the game and towards the end are generously dished out.- All consumables are found scattered throughout the world and the rate at which they are found is too sparse until the end of the game where you find abuntant clusters of items in short periods of time. It almost feels rushed in this aspect as with the oculi distribution.- Boss fights are not memorable especially the last boss they're just tedious for some reason.VerdictI really thought I would love this game but it feels somewhat soulless. Ubisoft positioned this game as a tribute to JRPG of old but for some reason it doesn't feel like a JRPG to me at all. The combat system is not memorable or engaging, the story while simple doesn't really hold up by the end. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game it's just not a good 'JRPG' as aspects which make a good JRPG are under developed or simply missing. Maybe next time...because, well it's Ubisoft, you know a sequel is coming. Recommended for those interested in a simple rpg.Not recommended for JRPG fans looking for a fresh take.PS: Steam please give us a neutral recommendation option.			"

												Child of Light is beautiful. Its mysterious land of Lemuria is a faded watercolour dreamscape of floating cities, gnarled and twisted forests, ancient ruins and peaceful country villages. It really does look like a fairy tale brought to life. Exploring spooky forests, shining lights on secret doors, collecting wishes; you're basically playing through a charming storybook adventure. Completing the feel is the lack of dialogue- there's no voice-acting apart from in some book-ending expository cutscenes, with characters otherwise speaking entirely in text bubbles. And rhyming. Because everyone rhymes in fairy tales.Our heroine Aurora is the mischievous daughter of an Austrian Duke. One day she falls ill, slips into a coma and wakes to find herself transported to Lemuria. To return home all she has to do is recover Lemuria's Sun, Moon and Stars, stolen by the mysterious and nefarious Black Queen, Umbra, who seriously has it in for our heroine for reasons that slowly become clear over the course of the game. Her journey will lead her across a beautiful but dangerous landscape, with a motley crew of companions at her side.As well as the gorgeous landscapes, character and enemy designs are terrific. Monsters are delightfully creepy. Wolves, ogres and spiders inject just the right amount of menace into the world, getting that sense of a formerly idyllic dream slowly invaded by a nightmare spot on. Balanced against these horrors are the charming cast, from the brave and forthright Princess Aurora herself to her jester companion Rubella and Capilli magician Finn. Child of Light's playful sense of humour is also ever present.The various regions and towns that you explore each have their own feel and atmosphere - unique and yet cohesively tied to the overall aesthetic.Aurora's constant ally and companion is the firefly Igniculus, sent to help the Princess by the seemingly benevolent Forest Lady, who appears to serve the powers of Light. He's your guide, really, a sentient ball of Light popping up to give you advice and encouragement. Igniculus can also be controlled; you can send him flying off to collect floating 'wishes', which restore your health and mana. You'll explore Lemuria from a 2D viewpoint, with much of the non-combat action feeling like a simple platformer. Quite early on you unlock the ability to fly, which opens up levels for exploration and generally adds to the floaty, dreamlike atmosphere of the game. Most of the enjoyment of travelling around the world comes from zooming about discovering secret areas and items, of which there are many. Run into an enemy while exploring, or flying, and you'll zoom in to take part in some good old fashioned turn-based battles. Child of Light utilises an action bar mechanic that will be familiar to anyone who's played Final Fantasy before.Combat may seem simple at first, but you quickly realise that simply relying on basic physical attacks isn't a viable strategy. It's important to have an idea of what your plan is, and to get your timing exactly right. There are also several special actions that increase your options.You control just two characters in battle, but switching in a new one is a free action. The best fights have you juggling your team in an out, de-buffing with one and dishing out the damage with another. Each character has their own skill tree, with three or four branches.While a briefer experience than most RPGs, Child of Light's shorter running time is actually not a bad thing. While promoting the game the development team described their aim as providing a brief but memorable adventure, like a couple of evenings spent reading your favourite storybook as a child. That's exactly the feeling I got, the sense of charm and wonder never allowed to grow stale with a bloated run-time. It's refreshing to play a game so confident and singular in purpose.			"

												After Playing for one hour, I can say that this game exceeds my expectation. Here is my opinion :Graphics:the graphic in CoL is really amazing. well , don't expect a well detailed 3d renderd images. the idea of drawing the whole game in watercolor is great. aside from being a graphic designer and illustrator anyone with a good taste will like the graphics in this game.Music:inspiring and dreamy. it let you inside the world of the game. I will buy the OST really soon.:)Gameplay:well, here some will argue with me.the game is based on a JRPG style gameplay, meaning its a turn base system in battle  with alot ot tactics. this kind of gameplay may not attract some of the players , espechially the new generation. well i'm sure there is some exceptions to that.In my opinion this game bring back some nice memories of the old JRPG games in its glory. and I recommend this game to any classic JRPG gamer who wanna find a decent JRPG game in this era.

												First time I started up this game, it blew my mind, amazing artstyle, intense, fast paced battle sequences, and a great soundtrack. It really felt like I was living in a fairytale. Story could have a little more depth but hey, thats the only complaint I have about the game. However, when I read all the negative reviews about it dogging on Uplay, I thought they were just overreacting. THEY ARE NOT. Second time I started up the game Uplay had DELETED ALL MY SAVE FILES AND WOULDNT LET ME SAVE ANYTHING MORE. I hear these problems are universal and it really pisses me off. Stop trying to spoonfeed us Uplay through steam, its not happening. The software problems ruin this absolutely amazing game. Help me Gabe			"

												:edit: I've finished the game so I can flesh out this review a bit.The first great thing about this game is the artistic aspect.It was pretty obvious how amazing this was going to be even before this game came out and Ubisoft definitely lived up to my expectations. The artwork is very beautiful and very pleasing to the eye. You don't want to rush through but take time to enjoy the visual aspect of the game. The aesthetic side also extends into every part of the game, from the way the main character moves to the beautiful orchestral music. I definitely plan on getting the OST if/when they release it.:EDIT: Someone in the comments just told me where to find the OST. Apparently, the music was done by the Montreal artist Cœur de pirate and you can digitally download it from her site for a little over 8 USD here: http://musique.coeurdepirate.com/album/child-of-lightThe story is another amazing part of the game. I've read a few reviews that try to knock it because ""its just a fairytale"". While this is obviously true, it doesn't detract from the game in the slightest. Ubisoft does a brilliant job of telling a story that, yes, in its simplest, most watered-down form, is just your typical fairytale. There are no real plot-twists, or at least, there are none they try to hide from you. It does have the ""evil stepmother"" trope and magic and princesses and all the things fairy tales do have. The game, however, fleshes out the story so thoroughly and beautifully that the result is more than satisfactory. The characters are all developed as far as could be expected for the format of the game, and poetic telling of the story just adds to the overall effect. The only other game that is really similar is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, another fairy tale beautifully told. In the end, the story is as satisfying as the artwork.The only thing I was worried about going into the game was the combat. I am not a fan of JRPGs or turn-based combat but I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the combat immensely. If I played it again, however, I would have played on the hard difficulty since the combat is rather easy and I only found it challenging once or twice. I never lost a fight and I only had a few characters die during a battle and that was only towards the end of the game during boss fights. If you dislike JRPG combat, don't let that stop you from enjoying the game...putting it on normal difficulty will allow you to enjoy the story without worrying about the combat. But if you like JRPG's or just want a challenge, definitely play on hard. You'll have to make more use of all the powers your characters have, especially their defensive and buff abilities. In addition, on a harder difficulty you will have to make more use of the gem system in the game, which provide passive abilities for each one of your characters.Overall, this game was well worth playing. It took longer than expected (10 hours) and was a beautiful and relaxing experience. It rivals Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons for the most beautiful indie game (yes, I know its Ubisoft, not technically indie) as well as my favorite indie game. It also shows what big gaming studios can produce when they try and hopefully points to a better future for gaming.And to anyone who decided not to get this game because of UPlay or because of ""first day DLC"". The only DLC in my opinion worth getting is the $2.99 one that unlocks the Golum character. His powers are unique and helpful so he is worth getting. Everything else is aesthetic or unnecessary, including all the little DLC's that give you gems...you find so many of them in-game, they're unnecessary. The experience of the game is complete even without the Golum so they didn't chop out a huge part of the game and then sell it to you as extra. Don't let it stop you from getting the game. And if you don't want to play it because of Uplay, I don't know what to say to you. You're just losing out on an amazing game because you don't want to deal with a piece of software that works pretty much smoothly and really causes no problems at all. At least, I've never had a single problem with them and I enjoy the rewards you can earn as you progress through whatever game you're playing.			"

												A beautiful tale in a watercolor land,Written as though from a children author's hand.Every line of dialogue you'll see will be written in verse,Unwrapping the tale of a princess and a curse.For the moon and the sun and the stars are all taken,Aurora's quest is made clear, the sky she must awaken!Cleverly written with characters as charming as can be,If you like RPGs, then I'm sure you'll agree!In all seriousness though, this game is a nice feel-good RPG, although one I felt to be relatively on the short side as far as RPGs go. The gameplay is turn-based with a gimmick in the form of a ""speed"" bar that will determine who attacks first, who manages to block or disable another, etc. Buffs and debuffs are available to speed you up, slow down enemies, block enemies from being capable of disarming you, etc. An interesting gimmick and well executed. One thing I found however was that there was a serious lack side quests, adding to the game's shortness (there's perhaps three ""main"" side quests I counted, all of which can be easily completed within less than ten minutes).The draw here is definitely how unique it is from a visual and storytelling standpoint. As stated, every single line of dialogue rhymes which I have to commend the writers for. Graphics-wise, the game looks like a beautiful watercolor painting. That said, one criticism I personally have was that with the exception of Aurora and a handful of other characters, all animations looks to be done in flash with serious tweening abuse, which I felt somewhat cheapened the experience (though that's likely my inner art snob talking, so take that with however large a grain of salt you will). It does cause some dissonance beside the rendered model of Aurora as well which was initially difficult to see past. These are minor complaints however. This game is gorgeous, the characters are lively and likable, and the soundtrack is amazing. Definitely worth owning.I do need to point out one final thing however, as this might be a deal-breaker for some. You WILL be forced to download Uplay. It doesn't matter if you launch the game through Steam, it will still automatically open Uplay. I've yet to encounter any problems other than being annoyed by the extra program running, however it might be worth your time to check out other reviews and the experiences other players have described before you make your final decision. There's been a lot of complaints about problems with save files or the game not launching. You have been warned.			"

												Is a really great game, but after 27h, the save game got corrupted and deleted, and all progress, almost at the end of the game is lost... and thanks to UPLAY, there is no Steam cloud save, and no way to recover it. Worst thing, I am not the only one, after searching the internet for solutions.. there is none, and it was not uncommon to have it at a similar location happening.I would have given it otherwise a 9/10, but now, I really cant recomment it, and I am one of those, who never had any UPlay issues before! And I dont think I want t play the whole game again... sorry			"

												Child of Light is exactly what the creators at Ubisoft Montreal intended it to be. It is a beautiful piece of gaming, with amazing visuals courtesy of the UbiArt engine, a soundtrack that can only be described as haunting, and the storybook tale of a young girl named Aurora, trying to return to her father, an Austrian Duke. The land of Lemuria, where Aurora finds herself, is fantastical and a blast to explore, and all of the dialogue in the land is completely in poetic verse. Every RPG player who has even a little bit of childlike wonder left in them should definitely take the game for a spin. But beware, a fairy tale story is just that: a fairy tale. Don't expect epic character development or combat. That being said, Child of Light doesn't need to be epic to succeed. Aurora's journey is one of simplicity; she does not wish to defeat a great evil, nor fight for a crown — she simply wants to see her father again. To do so, she must rescue the moon, sun, and stars — apropos goals for this type of adventure. Throughout her journey, she meets plenty of allies who fit the fairy tale mold; a circus performer looking to join her troupe and an anthropomorphic archer mouse who wishes only for the heart of his beloved are some of the first to join the party. Each and every character speaks in a rhyming verse, and while this is certainly engaging to read, I can't help but think that some of the lack of character development comes from the unique structure. While all of the characters have their moments, many seem to lack depth beyond simple quips that carry the meter. Still, this young girl's journey is one that is worthwhile, and it's backed by some of the best 2D visuals I've ever seen combined with a brilliant score. To say that Ubisoft Montreal has created a visual masterpiece wouldn't be hyperbolic; the watercolor-like portraits and sweeping vistas are complemented by a strong artistic vision. Environments like dark forests and the innards of a giant golem kept me exploring, but I wanted to see what I could do around every corner. Each place Aurora visited made me sit up and listen to the music.Beauty does come with danger, however, as fire, spikes, and other danger await Aurora as she flits about the 2D landscapes. While Aurora can fly almost immediately upon entering Lemuria, some of the platform elements are frustrating. I've never been a fan of damage or status effects being inflicted outside of battles, something that frustrated me to no end in Bravely Default, and I died without ever entering combat more than once. To be completely fair, some of this was simply a lack of care on my part, but I never felt like these sections provided anything to the journey. Had I simply solved a puzzle or continued along, the experience would have been almost identical. The combat is more satisfying, with its combination of elements from Final Fantasy X and Grandia. If you've ever picked up GameArts' Grandia games, combat will feel like second nature: a gauge runs the bottom of the screen which displays when characters will act. Once a command is selected, the icon runs through the cast section until execution. Depending on the power or type of attack, the cast time might be incredibly brief or very long, but commands of both friend or foe can be interrupted if they are attacked while casting. In Grandia, timing often felt a bit random, but Child of Light improves it with the use of Aurora's firefly companion, Igniculus. Controlled with the right analog stick (or a second player), activating him on enemies will slow them down, allowing the chaining of interrupts. His power isn't infinite, though; it must be recharged either with items or by moving him to plants that exude energy to absorb. That's not the only depth in the combat, though, as only two party members can be on the battlefield at any time. When it's any character's time to act, they can swap with another one of the various party members. Elemental weakness is important in Lemuria, so going up against a group of fire enemies means you'll probably want to switch to the characters with water-aligned abilities. The battle system is entertaining enough, though I did start becoming tired of it after a while. To take advantage of the different elements, planning outside of battle is important. Different gemstones, called oculi, provide unique bonuses and elements when they are equipped, and I made sure to have a character on hand with fire, water, and lightning as their primary attack elements. Some gems have less traditional bonuses, like being able to manipulate the action gauge. Three gems of the same type can be combined to create more powerful versions. This, alongside the three-pronged skill tree for each character, provides enough customization to make each character feel sufficiently unique. It's very clear just how much care and thought went into the development of Child of Light. It might not be a vanguard experience for fans of the genre, but there's enough depth to keep veterans interested. The charming story lacks a bit of depth, but with enough going on to tug at the heartstrings, it's easy to recommend Child of Light. As long as you can remember a time in your childhood where everything felt new and beautiful, there's an enjoyable experience to be had.Highly Recommended "

												After suddendly falling gravely ill Aurora finds herself removed from Austria and thrown into the fantasy world of Lemuria: unable to get back home and seeing her father slowly succumbing to depression she embarks on a quest to get back home, picking companions along the way.Child of Light is a quite simple turn-based RPG with an art style and story that'd be right at home in a fairy tale book: despite having a somewhat shallow plot and game mechanics it is still quite fun and engaging not to mention gorgeous to look at.PROS:-graphics and art style are absolutely stunning-good soundtrack-while simple the combat mechanics are quite engaging and keep you on your toes-boss fights are quite interesting and feel balanced-Aurora is an pretty good protagonist and shows a decent amount of growth during the game-you'll meet a nice amount of companions to help you during fights, each with their own strengths and skills-the rhymed dialogues are a nice touch-good lengthNEUTRAL:-the story is failry interesting but also a bit too cliched and simple -while beautiful to look at certain areas of the world feel a bit bare content-wise-uses UPlay- which is a big no for some- and lacks Steam features like achievementsCONS:-RPG elements are extremely basic-simple loot system -villains felt a bit too forgettable


Child of Light 
A Screenshot of Child of Light
By: stranger1982




Child of Light is absolutely gorgeous to look at and truly feels like a fairy tale in motion with its mix of pencils and watercolors: the art is backed up by an equally good soundtrack that quietly follows your exploration and turns suitably epic when you enter a fight. The gameplay is a throwback to older JRPGs with an action timeline where being attacked during a cast can see you interrupted and thrown back: this means good planning and timing- not to mention a judicious use of your skills- will go a long way towards making combat easier.The game suffers a bit in complexity though as the actual RPG elements are a bit shallow: each level up sees you getting a point to spend on a branching skill tree but most unlocks are just passive bonuses, loot and equipment are also very basic and are basically only gems to slow in one of your three equipment slots and a few potions. The story is failry interesting but most characters, villains included, feel a bit too two-dimensional to be memorable and this mars the narrative a bit: there's enough to move the plot and make you want to see the ending but that is all.Despite its basic gameplay and somewhat forgettable story Child of Light is still a game to recommend due to its interesting combat mechanics and gorgeous art: if you somehow missed it or it's still part of your backlog then know it's a game worth your time.

												Child of Light is a great game. Unfortunately, it requires uPlay! This is the second game I've bought that requires uPlay and  have given me endless trouble. I was having a lot of fun with Child of Light but uPlay decided to randomly delete my save data. I would recommend this game only if it didn't use uPlay.To the people saying ""Why did you DL it when it says requires Uplay."" I forgot to mention I bought both those uPlay games at the same time.

												Oh man, this was a major dissapointment. Ugh.So, I was at a friend's, and he had this on his PS4. I played, and fell completely in love with this beautiful game. I had to have it. I thought, ""just get it on steam, it'll be the easiest choice!"" I was wrong.So, i had just finished installing the game, and was jumping out of my skin to play my own copy of it, when i saw something strange load up, called Uplay. I was a little confused, but trusted Ubisoft and made an account. It then asked me for the confirmation code for Child of Light, so i pasted the copied Confirmation Code, and clicked enter.""A ubisoft service is unavailable, try again later.""I shrugged it off, waited a bit, and tried again.Same thing.Frustrated, i tried on multiple computers, multiple times.NEVER WORKS.It's a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing graphics, and beautiful music...If only I could play my copy.Please, fix this.Or take off this ""Uplay"" bullcrap.Something.

Child. Tuck yourself in bedLet me tell a storyOf Lemuria, a kingdom past,And a girl born for glory.Child of Light tells the story of Aurora, a daughter of an Austrian duke who finds herself transported into the land of Lemuria. She soon discovers her destiny is to recover the sun, the moon and the stars, for she is 'born for glory'. Through this tale Aurora groups with a diverse range of characters, each with their own tales and struggles. The land of Lemuria has grown dark, and in this world you fight on in search of your father, who has become ill and is dying. Very few games create such an emotional and memorable experience in story telling quite like this. Child of Light is nothing short of a masterpiece.Child of Light is a turn-based, role-playing-game that has a strong emphasis on exploration, atmosphere and lore. There is tonnes of collectables hidden throughout the world for you to seek out and collect. These collectables range from crafting materials to additional lore, which alike the game, takes form in beautiful poetic form. Child of Light has beautiful writing, whether it be in cutscenes or in simply talking to NPC's around the world; every piece of dialouge is artistic in every sense of the word. Few very games can truely be classified as artistic, in recent years it seems that a beautiful game is one that is graphically realistic, this is not the case with Child of Light. This game is far more imaginative and inspired that any game I have played in recent years, and it shows. The art style for this game is very 'child-like', but in a positive way. It compliments the games narrative and atmosphere perfectly from beginning to end. Where Child of Light shines most however, is the soundtracks. From the heart-plucking moments to the up-beat boss encounters, every soundtrack is perfectly conducted and adds an entire new layer to atmopshere that is rarely seen in video games. Any moment a new soundtrack would kick in, I would pause for a moment and just listen. Whilst playing this game, I went so far as to just refuse any distractions that would remove me from the experience; an experience that beautiful, emotional and engaging. The turn-based combat is also another truimph over games of it's genre, it's fluid, refreashing and requires strategy. In combat, you can control two characters at any given time. There is a bar, split into two sections, the 'wait' period in which all characters in combat will slide towards the 'cast' period at a given rate, depending on their stats. Once each character reaches the 'cast period, you can select a number of actions ranging from switching characters, casting spells, using potions or fleeing. There's a great deal of stategy involved and in many cases, especially boss encounters, the game can be quite the challenge. Once either all your characters are dead, or the two selected and out in combat die, the game is over and you continue from your last save. Battles are a rewarding experience because you're almost always guranteed for at least one character to level up, and from this, you can spend points into generous skill trees that differ from character to character.Child of Light is a simply amazing experience in every aspect. The lore is emotional and creative, the soundtracks are amongst the best in recent gaming and the gameplay is varied and rewarding. From the beginning to the end, you'll make decisions, you'll solve puzzles and watch Aurora grow on her journey. This isn't just a great game for it's price, it's a great game, full stop. I HIGHLY urge anyone who is interested in stories, role-playing-games or just looking for something new to pick this up and try experience it.By the end of the experience, when your journey is complete:""Igniculus: Aurora, what is love known by?~Aurora: When it hurts to say goodbye.""Child of Light is a masterpiece. Very few games offer such a complete experience in such an inspired form, and honestly, I'm finding it difficult to name a single game I've played, ever, that I've enjoyed as much as the experience on this. Child of Light isn't a game, it's art. "

												My review for Child of Light:First of all, I'm going to address 2 concerns that I found in Steam community hub:1. UplayThose who're going to buy this game should know that this game is going to use Uplay, Ubisoft own game client. I noticed that many people dislike Uplay for certain reason so gonna respect that. I have my own issue with Uplay as well. So if you want to buy this game, make sure you know what you're getting into.2. Day 1 DLCWhen the game is released, the dev put several DLCs immediately, including Golem DLC and Dark Aurora DLC which is the Special Edition bonus DLCs, Light Aurora DLC which is the preorder bonus and several ""cheat"" DLC which you can buy extra oculis for your game. Golem DLC gives you a new party member and a small quest to get him, while Light Aurora and Dark Aurora DLC give you skins for Aurora and extra oculis and bonus stats. The ""cheat"" DLC is actually consists of oculis, which means you can buy the oculis using real money once. Among these DLCs, only Golem DLC adds a bit of content while the skins just for eye candy. As much as I hate day 1 DLC, if you want to support the dev, buy the Golem and the skins DLC only. Of course you can ignore the DLCs if you don't want to support day 1 DLCs. I myself didn't bought any of the DLCs except Light Aurora since I preorder it.In this game, you're playing as Aurora, a princess who died and reborn into Kingdom of Lemuria. Story progress smoothly, gaining allies and some plot twist. However, the ending is kinda not to say lame, acceptable but not much impact. There are no voice narration for this game except the narrator herself. Somehow, I wish that each character got their own voices to add more personalities to the characters. You can quite rush the game since the story is quite short. And you can restart again with New Game+ feature so you can start the game with OP Aurora.The artstyle and graphic is beautiful. When you move Aurora around, you can see her hair move depends on the directions. The backgrounds and landscape are nicely drawn. Character animation during combat is kinda static. And the graphic glitch for Aurora’s hair where she transform into a tomboy during battle is not favorable by many, though I can deal with that. Now lets talk about combat. It's 2v3 style, where you can bring 2 members in your party to fight 1 to 3 monsters at a time. but you can only change party members during combat and not outside which is annoying. At least let the player decide which member goes on combat first. Before combat, you can only manage on the oculis to be equipped on each party members and use any skill points or healing items. In combat, there will be a timeline. Each member and monsters will be on the timeline. When you reach the casting point, you can give order to the said member ie attack, use item or switch party member. After selecting the action, there will be another timeline for casting. If you're attacked during this time, your attack will be cancelled and you'll be pushed back on the timeline which is also known as interrupt. You can also use this to your advantage to prevent monsters from attacking you. There are no visible health bar for enemies and no bestiary to see the weakness of each enemies so you have to discover it yourself, although some of them are kinda easy to spot. During combat, you can also control Igniculus, which is very useful in combat. he can highlight enemies and show it on the timeline. He can also slow down enemies by blinding them, making their progress on the timeline slower for more tactical approach. He can also heal you. To recharge his energy meter, he can either use potion or just shake the light source and collect the light.There is oculi crafting in this game, which is combining gems to make different and stronger oculis. Only 3 recipes are showed in the game, others you have to discover yourself (we got internet though ;D). Each oculi type has different effect depending on where you equip it. There are 8 types of oculis; 6 can be found in chests and defeating monsters, the other 2 need to be crafted. There is only 1 secret recipe for a special gem, but other than that, just normal crafting stuff. I wish they had put more depth to the crafting part since it's the essential part in the game.Each character has their own skill tree. Each skill tree got 3 branches and you can focus on either 1 branch first or balancing between each branch. Each branch focus on 1 special skill for the character. Example for Aurora, she got Slash (physical attack), Light Beam (magic, light damage) and Super Light Beam (magic, light damage, can 1 hit KO) (Disclaimer: The skill name is not correct :P). Each skill will have single targeting or multiple. And no character has similar skills, so it's good to know which one you wanna use during combat. Unfortunately, there's no explanation about the skills during combat, which make it hard for players to choose skills. There's also passive skills available, like Counter-Attack, Counter-Heal etc and it helps very much during combat.The soundtrack, is a masterpiece. I enjoyed every one of the songs. When I first started the game, I was stuck at the main menu because the song at the time, which is Aurora's Theme is mesmerizing. Even the songs during normal battle and boss fight is good and make me more enthusiastic to play. You can buy the digital album from here or you can listen to it on Spotify. Give it a go, I'm sure you'll like it.Overall, for the $14.99 price tag, it's totally worth the price. I still need to highlight that this game is not for Uplay haters and Steam elitists, because this game use Uplay as DRM so buying for Steam means using 2 DRMs at a time which is not acceptable for some people (you can see it in the community hub, people still b*tching about it lol). And Uplay is still in growing stage and need much more improvement. Other than that, this game is good and I totally recommend this game especially to RPG fans. "

												Uplay dramatically sours the game unfortunately, which is sad because it's an otherwise very pleasant game.Connection issues often snap you out of your game to Uplay to inform you of your disconnection, achievement prompts cause game slowdown, Uplay is the same sad gaming disruption that GFWL has always been and with it's upcoming disolve Uplay is sadly a strong contender for worst DRM system.I apologize this review is more about Uplay than Child Of Light but my experience was ruined by it unfortunately.

												Child of Light is so staggeringly beautiful that it’s not uncommon to find its presentation entirely overpowering that game underneath.Pastel colors swirl lushly through the environments, soft details illuminating a world lost in darkness, as wondrously animated heroines fly onward curiously taking in places as foreign to them as the player. Elegant piano melodies accompany you in the background, often joined by your own flute before coming to crashing crescendos when a fight inevitably breaks out. It’s the sort of all encompassing grace and artistry that it’s easy to become so swept up in it that when the game itself comes into focus it almost feels unnecessary, maybe even somewhat annoying as it pulls you out of your marvelling as you're asked to take part in tasks rather a lot less captivating.That game revealed itself to be a turn-based RPG, rather surprisingly large in scope yet scaled down so as to encompass a game far shorter than those it borrows elements from. There are quests to clear, huge skill trees to unlock, an ever growing party to manage, items to craft, and limitless enemies to take on. It’s ambitions are at once impressive, and a tad overwhelming, giving you so much to manage and consider that I was rather quickly lost in a sea of items and unlocks.Child of Light is constantly giving you more stuff, but it doesn’t take long to see that much of it is superfluous, bogging the player down with perceived options while burying the ones you actually want. The intimidating skill tree quickly becomes much less so as the levels and skill points begin to roll in at a generous pace, but the reward you’re met with always feels intangible and minor. Points add upon points to stats that never feel important, informing you you’re apparently getting stronger but never feeling like you’ve actually grown.The initially obscure crafting system spirals into inventory chaos, as you’re loaded down with materials that are more tedious to use than beneficial. Outfitting my party so as to broaden my elemental effect was only as useful as I was able to remember who was using what, in the continual swapping of materials as I attempted to build more useful items but inevitably ended up weakening someone in the process. The lack of any sort of guide as to the uses of different objects you can craft left me switching awkwardly between menus, testing loadouts before heading back in to actually make them. It’s convoluted and by the end I’d given up trying to make anything more from the system than I already had, hoping it was enough to get me through battles.Combat is one of the few areas that’s more often than not actively engaging, utilizing an interesting turn system that’s more reliant on timing than just beating enemies down as hard as you can. The idea is if you position enemies on the timeline so as to attack them when they enter the last portion and are preparing to attack, you can beat them back and effectively skip their turn, which if done properly can see you continually attacking without the enemy ever getting a word in. It’s the sort of turn system that requires you always be engaging and anticipating the enemy, and when paired with the various moves of your different party members and differing enemy weaknesses can give you a lot to think about and be really satisfying to succeed with.But as with all of Child of Light, you’re given far more than its systems can sustain, with enemies constantly pouncing you at every moment. After a point I began to run mostly on autopilot, so accustomed to an enemies patterns that they were no longer threats, but obstacles standing between me and what I hoped would be new things to fight if only I could get through to the next chapter. Even boss fights which are easily the most imaginative and interesting fights in the game, become agonizingly slow sets of attacks as you whittle away at an enormous invisible healthbar even as the boss becomes entirely helpless.The only place Ubisoft shows an amount of restraint is in Child of Light’s simple, endearing narrative which blends its fairy tale bedtime story with that of a young girl’s coming of age and learning how to deal with the responsibilities newly put upon her. It’s intentionally cliche at times, though in a way that’s comfortingly familiar, while still subtly subverting its tropes to allow a refreshing portrayal of a story you already know before it’s even begun. The choice to writing it entirely in verse isn’t as consistently successful, changing stanzas so often that trying to follow its rhyming is a small challenge, and the necessity of rhyming causes lines to sometimes read sillily or feel forced.Child of Light is an imperfect, exquisite creation, sometimes hard to love but yet difficult to pull yourself out of. I loved my time with it, even as I was becoming confused and annoyed at systems that often felt underdeveloped, finding trouble dismissing something so stunning and unexpectedly ambitious. It’s flaws are obvious and needing to be acknowledged, but I wanted so much not to, as my initial impression of unbelievably beauty continued to guide me through a game easily obscured by the creativity draped around it.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Worth the asking price. the hand drawn art is amazing, the music is amazing, the characters are pretty good also. This game was worth the run through. This is a true throwback to turnbase RPG's. I really enjoyed the character development in this game and i also enjoyed the skill tree. There was a couple of time i had to grind a bit to take on a boss but it was worth it. This is one of those games that make you long for old traditional turnbase JRPG's with a new twist to it.			"

												The game has been fun so far. I'm not overly far into it, but i'm enjoying the actual game. That said, uPlay is miserable. I sort of bought this on a whim after watching the trailer video when it was on sale, so I didn't even notice this was something I had to deal with. Live and learn. What I learned is I'll never buy another game that requires uPlay. This is why Origin isn't installed on my system anymore. At this point I don't care if uPlay and Origin make my PC faster and increase the overall size of my genitalia, you and your miserable DRM can rot. Not the devs fault. You made what seems to be a neat game, sorry you work for Ubisoft.			"

												Child of Light follows a young girl named Aurora as she travels in the fantasy world of Lemuria. It's a 2D rpg/puzzle game and if only described with one word, BEAUTIFUL! Beautiful writing, visuals and music.Child of Light has paintbrushed look and that fits really well with the story and especially the dialogue which is almost all done with rhyming. So as already stated the art in this game is wonderful on so many levels. For the most part there isn't any voice acting, only in few small narration parts.  You start the game alone, but some companions will pop up to join your journey. All of these followers have their own talent trees you can customize. Though these trees are quite restricted and you have to follow just a few branches. You can only have 2 characters active during battle, but you can swap them around freely. Combat is done with Active Time Battle system, familiar from some of Final Fantasy games. You can buff your team to perform faster or debuff your enemies to be slower on the timeline which determines the turns of characters. It's not very complex or deep RPG, but well worth the low price![Score: 86]			"

												Child of Light is a relatively simplistic RPG with minor platforming elements, mostly because one can fly around at will early in the game, with a motley crew of characters on a quest to defeat a Big Bad. By the book, but that's okay. The story revolves around Aurora, a princess who apparently died in the real world and woke up in the land of Lemuria, where the Queen of Night has taken the sun, moon, and stars. Very fairy tale.I've played the game almost to completion, literally being in the final area, and as I played this game something was bothering me. I couldn't figure out why, but I did not like the game. The music is fantastic, the battle system simple but complex in its nuances, the characters had character, and the environment was like flying through a painting. But I still didn't like it. I asked some friends, and one suggested that it was because it didn't form a cohesive whole, but that wasn't it. Then I finally realized why.It's because the game is hollow; it has no soul. The characters are archetypes who never break out of their roles to become rounded, the story is strictly leading the player around in a linear fashion with no hidden depths to plumb, and the music fades into the background of notice when there isn't much variety to it. Child of Light is just a thin coat of paint on a canvas, something to look at, maybe remark on, but there is no meaning to the art and I therefore have no reason to play it.			"

												when i think of buying this game i thought i was wasting my money but after playing for just 2 hours i was frozen. this is the type of game that i searching for soo long and said it was amazing. Child of Light far exceeded my expectations and has now become one of my favorite games of all time. The environment is lush , beautiful and the game play is seamless.  this is one of the most attractive, beautiful and atmospheric games I have played in recent years. The fairytale script is good enough to travel you back to your childhood, filling you with nostalgia, the art direction can leave you speechless, as well as the amazing soundtrack.This easily could have retailed for $49.99 and would be worth every penny still.

Had I known UPlay was involved, I would not have even tried. This review is intended to help warn people that UPlay is, in fact, involved and that it can prevent the player from even starting the game. If they want good reviews from me, they need to NOT make me dig through metaphorical fecal matter to get to the proverbial cake.			"

												I wanted to like this. I really did. And I did, but far less than I expected. I'm disappointed with the wasted potential of this game. I'm flagging my review as ""not recommended"" because I just wish Steam offered a neutral option.The 2D art is beautiful. The soundtrack is pretty good. The cast is diverse, something that's rare in video games. The dialogue is all written in rhymes. The battle system has more depth than it seems.But the game feels hollow and rushed. One example I'm sour about is this one. When you acquire the power of flying, very early in the game, there is a really cool cutscene that makes flying seem really magical. And it's just right at home in the game's universe. It strikes the childlike chord of your heart. And then you're able to move. And your character flies in a *really* stiff way. The complete opposite of the cutscene. It feels like a slap to the face.Another thing that grinded my gears is that the game doesn't really try to say anything (maybe except vague messages about motherhood). It's as generic as ""good vs. evil"" gets. And there aren't some cool story themes hidden between the lines as well. It's disappointing considering that besides the protagonist (who undergoes a really cool transformation two-thirds into the game), there is barely any character development at all. The story doesn't have any complex twist and turns either. You find yourself wishing the game had some sort of lore... anything at all that could give the story as much depth as the beautiful artistic direction has.The battle system is really nice but there's a big difficulty spike out of nowhere halfway through the game that requires a bit of grinding to go through (one particularly annoying boss). That's really the only part which requires grinding. In this childlike gleeful universe, this doesn't feel right. You battle with two characters at a time maximum, and can switch between them. They all have a distinct set of skills, which is an interesting mechanic, because while I dreaded this at first, I think it feels better to rely on more than just two people ever. Some of them are too situational though.The menu system, for inventory and leveling, takes you really right out of the game. It feels... insanely gamey and unintegrated, basically. It just cuts to complete silence, and it's kind of a pain to navigate through, especially when choosing your skills to level up. The skill ""trees"" (they're actually mazes on the menu!) are convoluted for no sensible reason. Nothing about the menu feels right at all. It breaks your immersion. All in all, this game feels like a lot of wasted potential. Maybe Ubisoft didn't allocate enough resources or didn't let the guys have enough time. It's one of those games that really have something going for them but just don't reach for their opportunity, and it's heartbreaking.			"

												Pros:+Beautiful Art+Great turn based game play+9 different party members+The whole narrative is in rhymes (see con)+No equipment to manage (see con)+Has a new game + mode+Beautiful ending credits songCons:-Not fully voice overed-The whole narrative is in rhymes (see pro)-No equipment to manage (see pro)Child of Light is a turn based RPG that's told in a rhyming narrative.  The narrative is mildly witty and fun at times, but can get annoying.  I liked it overall.  The art style and graphics to this game was top notch and extremely beautiful!  I loved seeing some of the backgrounds and caught myself just stopping to take it all in.The difficultly wasn't too bad as long as you killed all the enemies you come across.  There are no random battles and you can see all the enemies on the screen and you don't have to fight any of them, but strongly discourage this due to not being able to kill bosses.  There wasn't any grinding for XP during my adventure.  If you kill all the enemies they stay dead until you turn the game off.  Once you turn the game off everything respawns.  So, if you want to grind you can.There is no equipment upgrades in this game.  You don't have to worry about managing any loot.  There are stones that you can acquire from monster loot and treasure chests throughout the game though.  These stones allow you to customize your characters with minor stats IE: fire damage, water resistance, chance to crit, etc.There are a total of 9 party members that you can play with, but only 2 usuable at any given time.  Each has their own flavor of strategy.  Some heal, some tank, some buff and some debuff.  You can swap out whomever you like as many times as you like.  It doesn't matter who is in the party all members gain experience in or out of battle.  That was great and allowed me to use other party member combos however I liked.  You have a tenth character named Igniculus you can use and he follows you around in and outside of battle.Igniculus is a ball of light companion that helps solve puzzles and grabs items out of reach outside of battle.  Inside of battle he is used to off-heal and slow down enemies.  You can only choose one or the other on the fly.  I normally chose to slow down the enemies.  He can also be used in crowd control outside of battle too.  You can CC every enemy in the game and while doing so you can simply just pass them up and not fight them.  Great for times you just want to advance the story and not have to worry about getting into any battles.There's a lot of status effects during combat.  You can slow down enemies, speed up yours, add more armor and my favorite was the Unbreakable spell.  This spell made it so you never get kicked out of order during combat.  This imo was a must have spell and without it would had made the game quite a bit more challenging.  There are healing and reviving spells also and I'd recommend grabbing one of the DLC's that has the healing spell.  Yep, pretty stupid to have to buy DLC for a spell, but whatever I guess.  That's Ubisoft for ya!  :)This game does require Uplay and I personnally don't have any problems with Uplay and doesn't effect my purchasing of any game.  Not one time did the game mess up, crash or have any problems what so ever.  So, don't let this bother you.If you like games like Final Fantasy with some platforming and mild puzzle interaction this game is a must play.  Taking me around 15 hours to beat at level 49 it was fantastic and the asking price of $15 is totally worth it.  The game does go on sale a lot so grab it then if that's too steep.  Would play again.  10/10.  Recommended.			"

												As a whole, I think my opinion of Child of Light is somewhat mixed. The gameplay was rewarding and motivating, giving enough complexity to pique the curiosity of a player like myself but not so much as to confuse or discourage me - and indeed, the basic movement and combat in the game was whimsical and pleasant. The world and character design go to this, encouraging the player to explore the world. Ultimately, I think my dissapointment comes down to the writing, and the fundamental inability of the mechanics to sufficiently motivate through the game as a whole.While for the most part the plot and characters are quite charming and interesting, I think their simplicity is ultimately a drawback. While some characters experience adequate arcs, in other respects I thought the reliance on genre staples, or in other words tropes, made the story and characters feel stale or undersubstantiated. In particular certain turns for characters or turns of the story left me rolling my eyes or feeling somewhat dissappointed with the games inability to achieve reconciliation, or adequately build and progress character motivations and relationships to make conflicts that felt nuanced or resolutions that felt truly cathartic and enlightening. Ultimately that may come across as a disporportionate criticism of the game for what is in the end not the whole of its construction, but I do believe we have here a story that, despite its simplicity, wants to have an arc and have themes and learning, and in that sense I believe it falls a little short. Despite this, I would like to again highlight the charm of the game. Moments like gaining the ability of flight really capture the sense of whimsy, fun, and fantasy the whole game goes towards. That I would say is its biggest success.So, in short, Child of Light is a beautiful game with fun and nuanced yet not overly complicated mechanics and a charming, emotive story that as a whole feels somewhat flat and underwhelming. Still, I do not regret playing it and would recommend it to fans of the genre.			"

 If you own this game but haven't played it, you're not living your life correctly.This fairytale jrpg employs one of the most fun combat systems I've ever seen in the genre. They recreated the wheel and somehow got a flying car out of it. With precise timing and forethought you can interrupt enemy attacks--but they can do the same to you! Boss fights were all such a blast! The brilliant musical score combined with the storyboard managed to move me emotionally. Prepare to feel sad. I love the artstyle. The rhyming felt a bit forced at times, they could have put just a slight bit more effort into it or just dropped it briefly at times to emphasize that♥♥♥♥♥♥was hitting the fan. If you decide to play the easier of the two difficullties you can skip all the random battles and head staight for the bosess. That way it stays challenging and you aren't caught up in repetitive grindy battles or minmaxing your stats with items, finding chests, and crafting. Skipping most random battles will net you about six hours of gameplay (with five or more tacked on if you pursue normal mode like an idiot). You bought this game when it was on sale. It's time to play it.			"

Regarding the sound FX of the world, everything fits, a monster yapping, a jump, the wind, it all connects and doesn't feel out of place nor breaks the immension, this game, like Ori, are excellent in this regard, probably the bests. Quality.Graphically speaking, the game looks magnificent, and everytime you reach a new place, you find yourself looking at every place of the screen, mindblowing designs and drawings that are taken out of a fairy tale, beautiful. The magic of the game is greatly resembled too, and it's one of the strongest points in the game.The amount of hours might look short for an RPG, but it's not really short. Let me explain: The game doesn't drag on and there's no needed grind to proceed, some battles are indeed hard but can be overtaken by strategy, the story from start to finish feels good, like reading a book, there's no stupid fillers, no ""lets walk for 25 mins doing nothing"". It's all fun from start to finish, and at the end you feel realized and full because it doesn't leave you wanting for more like some other games, it's a perfect time.Now, regarding the gameplay, it's a turn-based fighting RPG, which is fast, there's no long animations that you can't wait for them to end (Final Fantasy X, anyone?), it's really fun thanks to constantly being in motion, you will be using characters in the fight that you can swap at any time, there are quite a few characters. They of course level up, and you'll have to see what's the best course of action regarding their skills. I want to mention that it's very fun to move as the protagonist too, specially with the amount of secrets that are everywhere! (And you will have to backtrack if you want some sweet secrets ;) ) nothing falls short in the gameplay, except maybe a bigger variety of movements/actions in the fights.Story: Fairy tale. You will feel like you're playing a tale, it's a beautiful story and quite touching in my opinion, I won't spoil a single thing.Overall, the game is a great time guaranteed for RPG players, you can't really go wrong with this game.

												+ VERY GOOD Active-Turn-Based Combat+ Stylish Graphics+- Good Character customization but CAN'T UNDO SKILL PICKS+- Soundtrack - Is good, but after 2 hours, BUT OMFG I PLAYED 2 HOURS AND I AM THINKING ON CUTTING MY WRISTS- UPlay- It's NOT a game for OCD players. Huge maps with TONS of secrets. Problem is, some secrets you MUST find to advance or to get side-stories. You simply can't play it casually, even if it is a game with a casual premise.--- SUPER CHEESY TEXT/STORY/ETC. I've got dehydrated because I drool playing this game faster than I can drink Coke. And I LIKE Cheesy. But not *this* level of cheesy.....STEAM: Could you give us SO-SO button, PLZ?			"

												Child of Light pulled me in with its adorable graphics, but overall let  me down after that. The game itself has a really neat real-time mechanic mixed in with its turn-based combat that I absolutely loved at first, but the combat itself felt grindy and repeptitive very quickly.Another downside is that the story was very bland and predictable, and the fact that everyone had to speak in rhymes really didn't help. If you wanted to get this game for the story, don't. If you wanted to get this game for the gameplay, probably don't. If it's on sale and you're willing to deal with Uplay, go for it, but otherwise maybe don't.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEChild of Light must be played via uPlay, Ubisoft's service. This game is basically unplayable because it constantly has issues with save files. The game auto-saves and syncs with the Ubisoft cloud at regular intervals. Well it routinely loses save files - completely. After about 4 hours of gameplay over several sessions I tried to open the game and continue my game and lo and behold - save files were missing. Just gone. Started the game again, played about an hour, came back later to continue from the save file and same problem - the save file is just gone again.A quick google search will tell you that this problem is pretty much universal. The game is unplayable because of save file issues and it seems to all be related to uPlay. Avoid this game (which is a really nice game, such a shame) and uPlay like the plague, that's all I can say.			"

  Introduction  Elegance. It's a word I've rarely found applicable where video games are concerned, but there's no better way to describe what Ubisoft has achieved with Child of Light. With its earthy, Art Noveau hand-painted art style and charming character designs, and unique combat system, it deftly brings the RPG landscape for the better part of a decade. This feeling of warmth and sentimentality can be seen in every aspect of Child of Light, from the character portraits in the menus, to the lovingly detailed hit animations in battle. The net result is an experience that feels less like a power fantasy, and more like the cherished memory of a childhood bedtime story. In addition, the game could be finished between 10-11 hours or even faster. It's a short happiness but last long for years. It's worth it.   Gameplay/Combat System  Its biggest success is the combat system, which skillfully mixes turn-based and real-time elements. Icons move along a bar at the bottom of the screen, indicating when you and your opponents get to act next. Scoring hits on an enemy who's winding up for a big spell interrupts them, canceling their move, and sending them back on the timeline. This creates a constant tension, forcing me to plan two steps ahead while looking for chances to interrupt, and keeping enemies from doing the same. That fusion of big-picture planning, and second-to-second awareness kept me feeling like a tactical genius battle after battle. Battles are also rewarding because of the steady clip at which your characters level up. After almost every battle, at least one of your characters advances, getting boosts to stats as well as earning skill points that you can use to unlock additional stat boosts or more powerful skills. Of course, it's fun to see your characters become stronger over the course of the game, but what makes Child of Light meaningful is the way that Aurora grows emotionally stronger. Eventually we have to leave the realms of fairy tales behind and face the challenges of reality once more, but Lemuria is the kind of fantasy realm that stays with you as long as you remain a child somewhere in your heart.  Graphic  Starting with one screen onto the next, Child of Light submits completely to its hand-painted aesthetic with Art Noveau style. Each stunning water-color backdrop looks ready to be framed and hung in an art gallery. That's not strictly because of the high level of overall quality, but also due to how warm the characters and environments all feel. Dark silhouettes of gnarled, ancient trees scroll through the foreground, adding a sense of depth to painterly forests, and oppressively dreary caverns give way to towering windmills amidst rolling hillsides. Each areas are breath taking, naturalistic beauty that words honestly fail to capture.  What We Learned  Fairy tales may be works of escapism, but no fairy tale worth its salt is purely a work of frivolous fantasy. No, the best fairy tales simultaneously let children escape from the frightening realities of life, while also helping them confront those realities, teaching them that even though life is difficult and scary sometimes, they are capable of overcoming adversity and coping with loss. Child of Light is a fine fairy tale in this tradition, a fantasy that deals with the reality of what it means to grow up.  Replayabilty  50:50 will play it again, because there are so many another good Turn-Based RPG games out there, like Final Fantasy or Sid Meir’s Civilizations.   Verdict  7.8/10			"

												Child of Light is one of my favorite games I have ever played. From the very beginning, it feels like a child being told a bedtime story. Every sentence rhymes and the amount of detail and attention paid to each written line is outstanding. The gameplay is simple yet intricate enough where it can create some fun challenges in battles. I enjoyed every second with this game and my only gripe is it feels short since you won’t want to put it down.PROS-Beautiful breathtaking world.-Complex yet simple combat.-Outstanding writing and story.-Charming and fun characters.-Good replay value.CONS-Feels shortOverall, this is one game you do not want to miss. Much is made of the UPlay restriction, but the game is launched right through Steam and you don’t even notice it. Please do not let you hold that back from experiencing this brilliant piece of art. I highly recommend it to gamers of all skill levels! Enjoy! :) "

												I've been playing for 3 hrs and it seems really good so far; however, in my opinion, it lacks some basic RPG mechanics, like equipment choice and a wider range of abilities of magics and skills, but i don't expect it to be very long, so this might not even be a bad thing. The trailer said it was a jrpg, but apart from the combats, which reminds me of Final Fantasy game is just a simplified version of a rpg; still, the game strength lies in its beautiful graphic and in the rhymed dialogues.Un RPG au gameplay rétro venant d'Ubisoft, juste une perfection. Tout dans ce jeu est parfait, la musique, les graphismes le gameplay, les personnages. Tout.			"

												I'm not going to write a super long, in depth review, but I will say this game is very fun and well worth the 15 dollar pricetag. On sale at any discount its an absolute must-buy. Pros:-Great Artstyle-Beautiful Soundtrack-Interesting Dialogue -Characters are fleshed out, and well written-Overall great story-Fluid combat-Solid RPG elementsCons: -Rhyming nature of the storytelling can sometimes get in the way of the story-Difficulty: On normal its too easy, but on hard the later levels become way too grindy, and while the combat is fun, its not fun enough for me to want to fight the same enemies over and over for hours on end to level-Few graphical optionsOverall a great game that I'm sure will end up on my top 10 games of this year. You should buy it if you like Turn based RPG's of any kind, or just games with a compelling and fun story.			"

												This is one of those games that makes you think of what a good game is, and what a good game should be.I bought this game long ago, the PS3 version by chance, I really did not know what it was about but a friend recomended it to me so i got it, and I can say it became one of the best experiences I had.This game is one of the very few games that chages my view on thing, and that's how a game really should be, not only having a good and fun time playing but to make you question stuff you wouldn't have thought otherwise. I really recomend this game, it shows there's still hope for Ubisoft.			"

												More than likely one of the best game ubisoft has given us in a while. It is simple, poetic and enthralling. The PRG mechanics are effective and can be understood by newcommers or veteran alike. It remind me a bit of Grandia 1, if it was a poetic experience rather than an epic quest across the world. The character are likeable and the gameplay is surprisingly varied between the puzzles, exploration and story.Definitely worth the time!P.S. be warned, it will install Uplay for you to play it, if this matters to you.-Lost			"

												Ubisoft has done something truly special with Child of Light, a product that resulted not from trying to appeal to the widest audience or focus testers, but a product that genuinely conveys the heart of those involved in making it happen.You play the role of Aurora, an Austrian princess who is trapped in the strange land of Lemuria trying to return home to her father. Along her journey, you will find various landscapes to explore, with secrets and collectibles hidden in every nook and cranny, a few optional side missions and a cast of endearing characters to aid you.Gameplay is centred on the open exploration of the world, and a turn-based combat system. While not in battle, you will be flying around the various lands of Lemuria, manoeuvring through various terrain obstacles and simple environmental puzzles, searching for a way home (and treasure!) with your firefly helper Igniculus who serves to activate certain locks you can’t reach, light up dark caves and also to stun enemies with the blinding light he emits. Additionally, you will find various characters who will provide side quests or even join your party. There are roughly 8 different party members, who range from a cowardly wizard, to a pair of jester siblings and provide entertaining dialog that is curiously written entirely in rhyme. While this is entertaining and sometimes impressive, it does make it more difficult to become emotionally attached to any of the characters, as a Shakespearean script is far from natural-sounding. Regardless, their personalities are still differentiated enough for each one to shine and leave a lasting impression and this should be considered a feat of writing on its own merit.The combat system is an interesting take on the traditional turn-based JRPG-style combat. In a similar way to the ATB system in Final Fantasy games, your attacks are based on a timer. Once the timer nears the end, you prepare an attack, but if the enemy manages to spring their attack before you have launched yours, it causes your attack to be “interrupted” and sends your timer further back. Likewise, you can do the same thing to your opponents. Igniculus helps out here too, by slowing your opponents so their attack bar will fill slower, but also by healing you or your allies and grabbing health/mana when he can. It’s simple to learn, but feels very rewarding once you’ve managed to nail the fine art of timing your attacks. Other familiar RPG mechanics include elemental attributes, random loot and a variety of potions that restore health, mana and provide buffs.You will participate in each battle alongside a party member. You can swap between other party members when your turn to attack comes without wasting a turn, meaning it’s very easy to adjust your strategy by utilising the various skills of your different partners. Each has a unique skill tree that expands as you spend ability points for levelling up through experience in battle. Some characters focus on damage, some focus on buffs or working in elemental benefits.Each part of Lemuria is a hand-painted masterpiece. The Ubi-Art game engine works the same visual magic as it did for the previous Rayman games, with a combination of high-resolution, 2D artwork spread over a multitude of parallax layers that results in every screen appearing unique from all the rest, with very few assets re-used. The watercolour artwork itself is both warm in its choice of colours and at the same time often melancholy, with ruined buildings and overgrown monuments in both the background and foreground hinting at a more peaceful past. The audio also adds to the atmosphere, with exploration music consisting of a few slow-paced piano scores, jumping to more frantic, orchestrated pieces during battles.Child of Light is let down only by its short length and by the plethora of “cash grab” DLC’s that were released at launch. But do not be discouraged, the game is presented in a way that uses every artistic medium available to it to craft an elegant presentation from an already highly competent game. It may be a short adventure, clocking in at around 10-14 hours for the core game, but the pacing of the story and diamond-like polish of the gameplay mechanics ensure that every hour is enjoyable while at the same time never overstaying its welcome.Pros:~Beautiful eye-candy artwork from start to finish~Fantastic writing feels like you’re part of a storybook~Wonderful soundtrack~Perfectly balanced gameplay mechanics, challenging without being unfairCons:~Day-one DLC, including a locked party member~Animation on some characters appears cheap~Main game will be too short for some to justify the price			"

												Played it on hard and beat it, Played New Game + on hard and beat it again. Took me roughly 36 hours. Got all the confessions, collected all the coffers and stardust twice and completed all the side missions twice. The only items I used were Stardust and Revive potions.The Good:- The artwork, if you’re into that look.- Combat, though at times it could be incredibly frustrating and it was basically just all about timing your attacks.The Okay:- The DLC is all purely cosmetic or stat boosting (The Golem is an awful character by the way).- Not too many launch day bugs (as compared to other titles released by UbiSoft)- The story is simple, but decent.The Bad:- In New Game + mode you couldn't speed past cutscenes. It drove me absolutely crazy that I had to listen to the dialogue over again.- The writing is just terrible. They force every sentence to a rhyming structure, and they don't even do that well.- The puzzles are simplistic in nature and few and far between, don’t expect anything that requires actual thought.- The crafting system, why does it even exist? It lacks any sort of depth, and the game is easily played on hard mode while ignoring it.The Ugly:- Uplay on launch day of course was acting up- Uplay on Watch_Dogs Launch day was acting up even worseExpect not to be able to play whenever Ubisoft launches a new titleOverall:I really wanted to like this game since I'm such a huge RPG fan, but this felt as if it was designed for children. They released a patch within the month after release to fix some of the launch day bugs, but I never got to experience the game with that patch.EDIT: Also, last time I buy anything from Ubisoft before its on sale, this game has been out less than 2 months and it's already 25% off, with all DLC being 40%. Its akin to a slap in the face to those who pre-ordered or bought it when it was released. I rarely pre-order or buy during opening month, forever Transistor gave me a hungering for RPGs that could not be satiated so that's why I picked this up.			"

												+ Very nice artwork+ Almost all dialogue rhymes+ Nice soundtrack, sound effects and narrative voice actor.+ Light-hearted ""bedtime"" story+ The beautiful gigantic maps are sprinkled with hidden paths and secrets rooms with great loot for adventurers to explore.+ Nice variety of characters with a unique skill tree for each of them.+ No grinding needed.+ Nice ""gear"" (Oculi) system with a decent amount of options to customize your characters.+ Timeline turn-based combat with an interesting twist: everyone shares the same timeline where its possible to ""interrupt"" and bump back enemies. If done right, the enemy won't ever be able to execute his turn. Of course, same applies to your party as well. Another interesting mechanic is the firefly (your mouse pointer). You can use it to slow down a single enemy or heal your a party member which depletes a seperate ""light meter"". All this combined makes for an interesting combat system.+/- The game has 2 difficulty modes: Casual (super easy mode) and Expert. Expert isn't very challenging, especially for veterans of the genre, but it does keep you on your toes as ♥♥♥♥-ups are less forgiving. This can be a good or bad thing, as the game is not intended to be an intense strategic challenge but rather a ""light"" game where you can sit back and enjoy the story and visual aesthetics.+/- Decent amount of side-quests (8-10?).+/- Decent length of around 20 hours playtime (my first playthrough was 24 hours and second playthrough was 15 hours = 39 hours in total).+/- Uplay. As much as I dislike having Uplay on my computer, it doesn't really bother you as all it does is have a second (automatic) login screen when starting the game. It has an offline mode option now as well so you can play without internet. If you do decide to keep it online though, Uplay will reward you with some Uplay points for every achievement which you can trade in for bonus items such as stat boosting ""stardusts"". Do note, however, that Uplay doesn't keep track of your achievements. If an achievement is ""Meet X"" and you've met X in offline mode, turning it back to online won't fetch you the achievement. The only way to get the achievement is to start over and meet X again.- Linear game- Not much replay value. New Game+ resets the story and you get to keep your character progression, your items and your ""confessions"". All it does is buff the stats of all monsters and EXP as well as better drops after battle. It still doesn't pose a challenge however. Then again, I might've been a little overleveled because I've equiped all my characters with Diamonds (+% EXP) throughout the whole game and haven't skipped any battles.- DLC Oculi Packs are a waste of money. Don't bother.For what it is, it's a very good game. Beautiful art. Easy to get into.9/10PS.

												Funshine Bear was hurtling towards my screen with sniper precision. My 7-year old daughter is a stuffed toy-throwing expert. She *really* fell in love with the lead heroine, Aurora, and each dramatic encounter would leave her aghast as the story unfolded. In this case a plushie bear attack was warranted as Child of Light got real right there. Funshine Bear might have lost a bit of stuffing too. The game was my choice for our daddy-daughter gaming nights and we enjoyed it so much, it warranted two playthroughs.	Upon first firing up the game, what immediately hits you will be the gorgeous artwork and orchestral music.  It grabs you by the arm and just fills your senses with a massive serotonin hit. Backgrounds are exquisitely crafted with several motifs ranging from grey-blue ghostly forests to lava-filled mountain passageways in the belly of a giant colossus.  Scene by scene, level by level, you will experience lush hand-drawn imagery and meticulously crafted character art design. Each level has it's own art tone, much like a watercolor painting that conveys emotion and depth.  Also, the characters you encounter have an amazing originality and natural warmth in their faces.  You'll easily be able to recall them even months after you complete the game.  Honestly, Child of Light has some of the most beautiful art direction I have ever seen.  At no point in the game does this attention to detail falter. It is consistently gorgeous with an air of childhood fantasy accentuated by it's unforgettable theme song.	 Then there is the story and dialogue, done entirely in iambic pentameter.  Which to some may be annoying, but I personally found it to be an amazing surprise.  My 7-year old followed it a bit more easily than some other games and the rhyming conveyed that fairytale vibe you'd expect.  I will say that after awhile, you do encounter some odd dialogue that either barely makes sense or doesn't seem to rhyme as well as other passages.  While it's not a major issue, sometimes I didn't quite follow what was being explained.  Doing an entire game in iambic pentameter is no easy task, so having a few odd bits here and there didn't really affect my enjoyment.	The story follows a little princess from a kingdom in Austria that either died or mysteriously ended up in a mystical land called Lemuria.  I couldn't really follow how in the world she got to Lemuria, but almost all the story takes place there except for a few cut scenes of her father.  You explore and fight, gaining skills and friends who join your party along the way.  Each character is from a chapter in the story such as wizard villagers, giant mice with superb financial skills, an acrobat circus girl and her whiney missing brother, a giant soldier dude who seriously needs a manicure, and a young fish girl who probably has the coolest attack of all by knocking her opponents backwards to gain an attack advantage.  Boss battles tend to be tentacled monstrosities or evil villains turned into aquatic-looking baddies with minions.  You attack the tentacles or minions, but it's best to get the head as much as possible and don't bother to use any potions or life saves until the last few bosses because you will seriously need them then and only then.  	Gameplay consists of a really interesting blend of crafting gems for skill points, a time limited RPG attack system, and a very nice method of switching party members to change up the strategy.  It works quite well.  The fighting occurs along a time line, giving you some unique methods of attack and defending.  The gems can be used to help against evil monsters by bolstering your character powers with skill against certain elements such as fire, earth, water, or lightning.  However, if you are familiar with turn based combat, I'd suggest playing on the hardest level.  Eventually, you'll fall in a groove of picking the right set of persons to attack and the right partner to heal them regularly.  I'm not particularly good at turn based combat, but I didn't die until the last few boss battles.  Even my 7 year old girl was able to handle the majority of fights after she saw the way I beat them, and pretty much only asked for help with the bosses when she played by herself on the second playthrough.  It's a little too easy on the normal setting.  You'll have to play with the character selection a bit to figure out which one has the best attack, but other than that it's fairly straightforward.	It's quite hard for me to critique this game, it has so many positives going for it.  Could it be a little less fairytale-ish? Um, yeah.  It could, but in doing so it loses some of that charm it's shooting for.  Was the combat boring? Not at all, occasionally tedious at worst.  With all the options given to you there is a lot to play around with in attacks and strategy.  Knock an enemy back in the timeline, defend until the right moment, switch out a character at the last moment, use the little firefly to slow down the enemy attack.  I could go on and on.  Do I really want to play a game about a little girl?  At first, not really.  Then as I played on I began to enjoy it quite a bit.  Child of Light has some of the best style, art, story, music, characters, and combat for such a small title.  I think the only weak link were some of the puzzles which were all on the easy side.  There were a few side quests to do, but I only did half of them.  It was preferable to enjoy the game story and combat rather look around for quests to complete.  This game shines brightly and is well worth the time to finish to the end. I highly recommend it			"

												A charming game with beautiful visuals, fun combat, and a decent story.This isn't the best game I've played, far from it, but it was well made and enjoyable enough. After my saunter through the main story and a few side quests (8-9 hours), I was ready to be done. I left a few side quests unfinished. After you beat the game you are given the option to keep playing and finish what you started, but I was ready to be done. Also, the first time I tried to play it didn't really take with me. Not sure if the beginning is very boring or if I was in the wrong mood.If you're unfamiliar with the game, it's a sidescrolling RPG with a turn based combat system similar to maybe an old Final Fantasy game. The entire game is presented as a children's story, and everyone rhymes everything they say. This leads to a few funny moments but can get pretty old. The story is a children's story cliche, but it's done well enough.There is a good value for the asking price (even not on sale, 15 bucks isn't bad!). It's really nice to see a AAA studio take a chance and do something that isn't another iteration of their tried and true franchises and make a game like this. So although not perfect, I'm glad this game exists, and I recommend you play it if the subject matter interests you.			"

												I liked the soundtrack, the mechanics and the idea. But the story in itself wasn't something really well written, was a bit.. cliche, the sidequest on the other hand were more immaginate than the main one. The members of the party were too similar and not really important, I mean there is some I never used aside for potion using. Also there is 1 member of the part who left and there is no way of getting it again, so all the equipement, lvl up and upgrades are lost. For a ""Pseudo"" open world since you can travel back as much as you want, there is never a real reason for that, aside from extra items and maybe achievements, but for story of lvl grinding is totally useless. As a final thing, Uplay, there is no reason for it to be using Uplay aside of use Disk Storage and sell you DLC. That is another thing, the DLCs are all totally useless, some give you items you get in-game with no trouble, some are skins (ok fine) and only 1 give you something relatively new, a party member, not even more story.I'm glad I brought this game when on sale, because is totally not worth the full price, heck no even 2/3 of that price.

												So, is this a great game ? yesDespite no voiced lines and the story being humm kind of simple (there's no deep secret or surprising ends)The art is beautiful, the backgrounds are beautiful, the game character is cute, the music is beautiful.All these creates a really immersive experience even for a somewhat hardcore gamer like me.The game is amazingly easy in normal, somewhat harder but not really hard in ""expert"". For those reasons I'd recommend this game for the less gamers among us (maybe your wife/husband or childs). Even for us gamers it's a really nice experience albeit a bit on the short side. (about 20~25 hours on expert with extra time spent farming & looking for all the chests)			"

Child of Light 
A Screenshot of Child of Light
By: Daerphen




The story itself is not new. You are the little princess of light ""Aurora"", who has to save the world (she is living in) from the dark. On your journey you will find many friends. Fighting takes place in a turn-based combat with realtime elements. Each character will influence the battle with other buffs, debuffs or special attacks. In realtime you can heal your characters or slow your enemies. Each character has a waiting period and a casting time. Depending on which cast you use, you may shorten the cast time or extending it. If you get hit while casting you get interrupted.All in all this is a very beautiful game. I really recommend every person who likes fantasy, rpg, turn-based combat to try this out. Only downside was the difficulty of the few last fights. Even on lowest setting it was pretty hard for me (a person who does not often play turn-based)DLC's may help you in your adventure, but you won't need it to finish it. "

												Dá uma luz mesmo de satisfação, esse jogo. É lindo, tem músicas cativantes e tem uma história MUITO bacana.O jogo é muito gostosinho, eu tenho um tédio muito grande por RPG de TURNO mas esse me prendeu. Os personagens são divertidos e interessantes, os ambientes incríveis e fantasiosos e a protagonista tem uma personalidade que te convence a se passar por ela e enfrentar junto a ela tudo o que ela tem de enfrentar.Sobre o coop, não cheguei a jogar mas  acho que é uma opção até válida porém não tem a mesma emoção do que o single, porque são personagens diferentes e o player 2 vai ter ações minimizadas no jogo pois não joga com a protagonista.O jogo possui muitos bosses porém sem dificuldade para vencê-los, somente paciência. Talvez você pode se perder um pouco ou esquecer do que deve fazer mas basta abrir o menu (que tem indicação da sua próxima tarefa) e você ainda possui o recurso de ""viagem-rápida"" também através do menu para não ter que voltar tooooooodos aqueles caminhos, cidades, lugares, morros nos seus ""próprios pés"" - que encurta bastante seu tempo para caso precise ir a um local longe para fazer quests a parte.Eu sei que muita gente sempre reclamou da Uplay, mas para a minha primeira vez utilizando-a não tive um problema sequer (inclusive as ""ações"" de lá funcionavam muito bem). Sobre os saves, parece que há um erro, mas eu nunca executava o jogo por lá e sim somente pela Steam e nunca perdi nada.			"

												I thought it was fun. The RPG elements were cool and the gameplay was pretty decent. The battle system was stellar and certainly hearkened back to game days of old. The artwork was amazing. The game was truly beautiful. The story wasnt stellar in my opinion. It was decent but also forgettable. According to Steam, I put 11.6 hours into the game, and according to UPlay, I have 4 achievements left. I probably wont put any more time into the game to wrap up those loose ends unless I'm bored on day, especially since all that is tied to Uplay, which provides almost no motivation to try and wrap up challenges other than to feed the completionist in me, which is almost non-existent anyway.Overall, I think I would give it 8 out of 10 for gameplay, but probably 6 out of 10 for story, and 10 out of 10 for artwork. Recommend, but not at $15 price tag.			"

If you enjoy arty stuff then you will probably still get your money's worth just going on the easiest difficulty and 'watching' the game rather than going in with the mindset that you are going to play something. The lack of depth coupled with Uplay is enough for me to unfortunately have to give a thumbs down on recommending this game.			"

												Even in our darkest moments if we look hard enough theres a spark of light. Of all the games I played this year,  I think this one is my favorite. This game tells the story of a little princess who wakes up in a strange fantasy world that she must save. It's really refreshing to see a Princess saving herself and not the other way around! The world the artwork and the storytelling are BEAUTIFUL. Every line in the game is literally a verse of poetry. It's not always perfect but it's still awfully cute. Aurora is adorable and there are plenty of awesome characters you'll meet along the way.The combat is a pretty basic. It's Turned based like Final Fantasy with a couple twists. It's not very hard and if you have ever played a video game before I reccomend Expert difficulty otherwise the game might end up boring you. The fights get more challenging as the game progresses but aside from boss fights I never really had a problem.Oh and did I mention the music? The music in this game is incredible. When i first bought the game I listened to the title screen for a while before actually playing <3 Here's a link to the OST if you end up enjoying it as much as me. http://musique.coeurdepirate.com/album/child-of-lightOverall I think this is a great game. I really enjoyed it and reccomend it to anyone who like turned based RPGs and wonderful stories!			"

If they later in the game let me ride a crowned unicorn and change my dresses into ""pink-glittery-stuff"" im overly overdue into my fairytale girlie-world.Apart from that it has a wonderful storyline, an amazing pretty world, beautiful drawn game, lovely animations, the world is huge and a bit of a labyrinth but not too complicated, it has many secrets you can discover and is a very well ballanced RPG. And a few riddles to solve along the way. U control very simple (with a controller) both characters to reach further parts of the worlds with different abilities. This game is just a MUST-LOVE-Game for women. Probably not really for men.			"

												Child Of Light is a 2D turn-based RPG that has a gorgeous artstyle, in addition to a cute story that's told in nothing but rhymes.The combat mechanics are similar to the ones in Grandia 2 (another excellent turn-based RPG, by the way). Your character's portrait will move from left to right on a bar at the bottom of the screen and when it reaches about 75% you can pick an action. When it reaches 100% they will execute this action. But, if an enemy hits you in this last timeframe you will be set back somewhere on the bar and your enemy will probably have the advantage by then. Of course, this also works the other way so it requires tactics to defeat your enemies. Enemies are also vulnerable to certain elements (fire, water, lightning, light, physical) so you have to switch between actions and characters in order to beat them. It's pretty deep.Fortunately, you can usually select which enemies you want to engage, with the exception of bosses obviously. Battles can be a bit too long, and sometimes you have no other choice but to engage enemies because you really have to level up if you want to make those boss fights any easier. Exploring the world can be boring because except for a few sidequests there isn't much to do. Yes, you can open up chests or collect letters but they're usually 'hidden' in plain sight so the excitement of discovering things just isn't really there. Navigating through the world can also be a bit frustrating because it's not always clear where you have to go to, or what you have to do. Near the end I thought I was finishing up the story while in fact I had been completing a sidequest this entire time. But I guess that's a bit of the excitement part I was just talking about.The rhymes also feel forced sometimes. Whenever a part of the story is told it all feels very natural, but whenever characters talk with each other it just feels awkward and forced. I think it would've been better if nothing but the story was told in rhymes. You know, sometimes less actually is more. That doesn't take away the fact that some are the rhymes are really nice and/or cool.The game is long. Long enough actually. Any longer and it would've outstayed its welcome. I finished it in around 9-10 hours, but doing all of the sidequests and collecting everything there is to find will take you 3-5 hours extra if I would have to take a guess.I really enjoyed Child Of Light, especially halfway through but there's definitely room for improvement. Less rhyming, better navigation and exploration, and a bit more variety. If I had to rate it I'd give it a 7.5. In other words: a solid game.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Yet another game for which I wished there was a ""neutral"" review option. Child of Light is not a bad game, however it has many little defects that prevent it from being the real gem it could have been. I'll briefly explain what are the pros and cons of the game in my opinion.PROs:+ Beautiful visual style and art direction.+ Simple but effective combat system, which is an interesting variation of the classic ATB-based system often seen in JRPGs like Final Fantasy; the player has the possibility to influence in real time the speed of his enemies, thus making combat more dynamic.+ Tactical boss battles; bosses are pretty smart and strong and you'll need to plan your moves carefully when facing them if you don't want to be defeated, especially when playing at the higher difficulty.+ Good variety of playable characters and skills.+ Nice soundtrack.CONs:- You can only deploy two characters in battle at a time, which limits a lot strategy and often makes you feel like you have too many characters and too little space. Most boss battles require a continuous change of formation in order to be able to use the proper skills at the proper time, which often leads to waste more turns than necessary.- Some characters are rarely useful and towards the end of the game you'll pretty much always use the same ones.- The game is fairly short for an RPG (the 20+ hours I've spent on it were way more than enough to finish it, and I lost a good amount of time trying to farm gems and exp until I got bored) and there's no real need to exp your characters to the full extent of their skill trees in order to progress. There's also no real need to craft all the perfect gems to be equipped, also because finding all the necessary ones would require a lot of grinding. The longevity can be extended by playing a New Game+ but since there's no real change or reward for doing it, most people won't bother.- The story is very basic, despite the interesting presentation and the peculiar rhymed narration, and that's just awful for a RPG like this. Yes, there is some lore (god I'm starting to hate this word) to be reconstructed by finding confessions, but it's nothing particularly detailed or deep. Most of the backstory is left to the imagination and all focus is on the simple main plot.- Not a defect of the game itself, but it requires a Uplay account to be played. It wasn't a problem for me to create one but I really find stupid to use two DRMs for a single game. If Ubisoft didn't want people to play this anywhere else than on their platform, they shouldn't have allowed Valve to sell it on Steam. Period.Considering all I think that Child of Light is a flawed little gem that could be worth a play but only if picked at sale price and only if you're not looking for deep gameplay or story. Otherwise you'll be very disappointed. I honestly expected much more from this title considering its fame and the enthusiastic reviews, but I guess that nowadays people are just too much inclined to see all the positive aspects of something they knee-jerk like and forget about objectivity.

												I like those small Ubisoft games. Child of Light has colorful characters, an adorable art style and an engaging gameplay. It's quite fun to have all of the text written in verses; it's definitely something that makes this game stands out.I just wish the soundtrack was more diverse (I feel like I'm listening to the same theme with a few variations as well as two or three battle songs) and that the gameplay didn't feel so repetitive after some time. I changed the difficulty settings at chapter 7 or 8 not because it was too difficult, but because I was tired of the battles and wanted to rush them.			"

												Beautiful game, really captures the feeling of a children's fairy tale.  Classic Final Fantasy style game play is familiar yet really smooth and just feels right.  The characters are really balanced.  I ended up relying on pretty much all of them and they complement each other really well.  It's fun flying everywhere.  I recommend skipping the DLC, however.  Most of it is BS in-game consumables.  The co-op mode is a bit weak with a second player able to control the ""ball of light"" helper, which a single player is perfectly capable of controlling as it is.  The second player is pretty limited.These are minor complaints though.  Overall it's a great game which I really enjoyed and felt it was worth it.  You will likely enjoy it if you're a fan of this type of turn based RPG.			"

												To be honest, this game possesses what so many other games lack.The strength of Child of Light is the combination of the brilliant music, a sweet story and amazing art and animation which creates a truly immersive and beautiful gameplay experience.The combat isn't anything complicated but requires a surprising amount of experience for optimal battles. I actually really liked how the action/casting bar functioned because it requires you to defend more than you would do perhaps in other games - I typically would never go near a defend button in a turn-based game.If I had a problem with the game, it would be that it didn't last as long as I wished it would, it was kinda short (full completion 12hrs on story-focus difficulty). Regardless, I really enjoyed it and found myself stopping to admire the setting more often than not.			"

												What a wonderful game child of light is.  Beautiful 2d water color graphics pop out at you constantly depicting a dreary forest, and ancient monastery, a mountain mouse village and many other vibrant story book places you will visit on your journey.  The combat is rather simplistic turn based affair, think old school final fantasy except you have a gauge at the bottom of the screen that determines your attack time and you can use a particular friendly ally and some various skills to manipulate it in your favor.  There are many magical and physical attack skills to learn as you level up, giving you some customization and control over your party.  There is also a deep crafting where you build magic stones and charms to power up your equipment.  Lots of interesting characters to meet and some will even join you on your journey to reunite your family.  Best of all every party member you get has a particular style of play so strategy comes in as to who you play when, and you can swap them in and out during battle.  Lots of side quests and nooks and crannies to explore, if you are a completionist or just like to peer in every corner of the world you will be rewarded.  Just enough of a challenge on normal, more experienced RPGers should skip to hard.  One of the better turn based rpgs in a long while, a must play for rpg fans and anyone seeking a whimsical adventure.			"

												A fairy tale of a game with wistful music and dreamlike environments, and an incredibly open feeling world due to being allowed to fly freeform through the entire thing.The game tells the story of an Austrian Princess, Aurora, who ends up in a mystical fantasy world called Lemuria, told that she must save the world from the evil Queen and recover the Sun and Moon, with the help of her magical crown, magical sword, and her friends. From there begins a rhyming journey across Lemuria, meeting jesters, gnomes, beasts, and more that join your party. The game is set up in JRPG fashion, with turn based battles that are reminiscient of Grandia with the use of the timeline, and interruption skills that let you halt and delay enemy attacks, and let them do the same to you. Your party levels up constantly, and while individual levels don't offer too much, over time you accure new skills, upgrade old ones, and get a steady feed of progress across your entire party (as even inactive party members get full XP!) Equipment is handled through the use of ""Oculi"", colored gems that can be combined with themselves to make bigger versions with new effects, or with other colors, entirely new versions with new powers.Party members are all useful in their own way, and I found myself using all of them except the final party member you get, a great deal. They tend to be split along usual lines, physical attackers, healers, tanks, magical attackers, and etc, along with a party member who specializes in manipulating the timelines. Each character has three separate skill trees they can go down that emphasizes particular skills and stats, and Stardust, found through the game, can be used to permanently increase  acharacter's stats, allowing you to customize them further (or just feed them all to Aurora because the main character should obviously be the best at everything.)The game feels just long enough to tell the story it wants to tell, and the world helps it every chance it gets. The music is immersive, the art and world are watercolored and move you across lots of different environments. Honestly the only thing I felt really detracted from the game was the forced rhyming scheme. It doesn't follow any real rhythm and just focuses on trying to rhyme lines regardless of length. One party member has recurring issues finishing rhymes and it's lampshaded by another party member constantly, which might actually be the best part of the whole rhyming gimmick.There's two major downsides to this game though:1: It's an Ubisoft game so it comes bundled with uPlay. This is your own thing to deal with, unfortunately. It didn't bother me.2: The DLC is straight cashgrab stuff. The Golem character's quest takes about two minutes and he is ultimately forgettable, but useful. The rest is complete cashgrab items that aren't even good - you can acquire them from the first few treasure chests to come across. To provide context: It takes dozens of lower gems to make the higher ones, in a 3 -> 1 ratio. Don't buy the DLCs unles you really want the other dresses for Aurora.... or the Heal skill unlocked for Aurora that comes from the Light Aurora pack. The healer you get in the game works perfectly fine though, and she's the first party member you meet.Wonderful game and absolutely worth the price of admission.			"

												I've played the entire game through twice now, and I feel comfortable in saying that, on the whole, I would recommend Child of Light to anyone who asked. But that doesn't mean it's without major flaws. As much as I enjoyed playing the game, the longer I did so, the more I became convinced of one thing: Child of Light is a decent game that could’ve been a GREAT game with better story and character development.Before I further explain that thought, let me leave you with a list of things I really, really liked about Child of Light (in no particular order):1. Aurora. Despite my (soon-to-be-explained) issues with the character development, I enjoyed playing her because she’s a character with real agency. Over the course of the game, she makes a series of tough decisions using her own intuition and courage, and the narrative never treats her with condescension, or undermines her ability to make those choices.2. The combat system. This is one of my favorite parts of the game. It’s a classic RPG turn-based system with nifty little twists. Your party members and the enemies appear on a single timeline at the bottom of the screen; the speed at which each character reaches the end of the timeline determines who attacks when. The nifty part is that the player can slow down the enemies’ progress on the timeline—and even interrupt their attacks—thus adding an extra layer of strategy.3. The variety in party members. There are a lot of characters who join your party over the course of the game, and they each have different strengths. This gives you plenty of options in battle, and you can customize your combat style to suit particular enemies. As an added bonus, you can easily swap out party members in the middle of a battle and still have the newly-swapped-in party member attack on the same turn. I was really thrilled about that. More skilled gamers than I might find it too easy, but I enjoyed it. It actually gives you a chance to try out all these characters that you otherwise might never play.4. This is rather an obvious point, but the art. The visuals are simply stunning in this game. There’s so much visual depth to appreciate--I wondered if the art-style would make the background look flat and obviously one-dimensional, but it doesn't at all. The artists and developers also did a good job of integrating the moving characters into the painted scenery. They don’t look disparate or disjointed. It’s all very cohesive and lovely. 5. Exploring the world. In large part because of the gorgeous art, it’s really fun to just fly around and look. I liked poking around all the areas of the game and soaking it in.6. (I'm sorry, I must all caps this because I WAS SO HAPPY ABOUT IT.) YOU CAN FLY FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT WITH NO STUPID, HALF♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IMPOSED LIMITS. 7. The hints and undertones of myth. This is another element I wish had been better developed, but what information we do get about the world’s history and legend is intriquing to me. It creates a nice ambiance, even if it isn't as prominent or developed as I would've liked.So, bearing in mind all the things this game does really well… I have to say, I was fairly disappointed in the storyline and the character development. Those are the two great weaknesses of Child of Light, and I think that's worth knowing before purchasing the game.The story’s greatest shortcoming is its pacing. It starts off interesting enough—the main character, Aurora, appears to die in “the real world” and then wakes up in Lemuria, a fairytale world—and she spends the rest of the game trying to get back home. The pacing is fine in the beginning of the game (central conflict is established), and stays fine toward the middle of the game (central conflict gets more complicated) … but then the “middle” of the game suddenly becomes the end of the game; in what I honest-to-goodness thought was the middle of the story, the end-stage of the story came hurtling at me, and I found myself fighting the final boss, and everything was wrapped up in ten to fifteen minutes. As a player, I was left wondering what the hell just happened (wasn’t I just in the middle of a quest? Shouldn’t there have been more conflict before THE FINAL CONFLICT?). The ending is very, very rushed and therefore feels very, very forced.  I seriously thought I was still in the middle of the story when I came to what was obviously the final dungeon—that’s the kind of rushed I’m talking about.If I had to break it down, I’d say 60% of the game is decently paced, but that last 40%—the part of the story that should feel EARNED, that should be a natural progression of what comes before it—is like a freaking whirlwind. There’s so much wasted potential in the narrative. And that’s the most disappointing part: if the writers/developers had invested more time in developing the middle-end and end of the story, it could’ve been so great. It had all the potential in the world, and then wham. Here’s your hat and coat, show’s over ladies and gentlemen. I think the poor character development goes hand-in-hand with the rushed story. If the narrative had been better-developed, I imagine the characters would’ve been better-developed too. As it is, they get left behind with the rest of the game's potential. The other major flaw with character development is that the writers told rather than showed. Most of what passed for development in the side characters—hints at personal back story and motives for joining the party—are all told rather baldly in dialogue, and that’s it. What you’re told is precisely and only what you get. There’s some cute dialogue between the various characters, but it’s all very surface-level and never leads anywhere significant. There’s no conflict or independent action or progression with them. This is the down side to an item on my pro list: because there are so many party members, none of them get the time and attention needed for real development.The most developed character is Aurora, but her character arc has a lot of the aforementioned problems. I will say, though, that she has more urgency in her story—she has something very real to lose, and that creates organic conflict around her choices and actions. So I do applaud that part of her development—it just could’ve been SO much better with the right pacing.So there you go. This game does a lot of things right, but because of its bad pacing, it really suffers in the story and character department. Ultimately, I enjoyed my experience playing the game, but if a haphazard ending will ruin the experience for you, it might be better to walk away.			"

												The difficulty of reviewing role-playing games is that they so often seem more an assembly of parts than a sum, and, while Child of Light's parts do cohere nicely, it remains a challenge to describe as a whole rather than a collection of discrete elements.  Perhaps this reveals that its coherence is an illusion, or it could just be the nature of the genre.  It's a game that clearly has a soul, but that soul doesn't seem to come from a single auteur so much as a group of artists and designers working hard to ensure that their ideas coalesce.  At times, they strain themselves, but to their credit the seams rarely show.Child of Light is a Japanese-style role-playing game along the lines of Final Fantasy but agreeably streamlined.  You play from a side-on perspective, traveling through landscapes filled with roving enemies, environmental hazards, simple puzzles, and secret paths and alcoves.  Exploration is a pleasure because of the freedom afforded by the ability to fly in all directions, and each area feels fluidly laid out and is full of treasure to discover.  The protagonist, Aurora, is accompanied by a light elemental named Igniculus who can interact with objects and stun enemies, enabling Aurora to move past them without a fight or to get behind them for a surprise attack.Battles pit Aurora and one of her companions against an enemy set of up to three, and all participants move along a timeline displayed at the bottom of the screen.  This timeline is the core of Child of Light.  It is divided into two regions: a long wait period and a short cast period.  When a combatant reaches the threshold between them, s/he chooses an action to perform.  The cast time for any given action depends upon the character's speed and the specific action itself, and, if a character is successfully attacked during his/her cast period, the action is interrupted and s/he gets set back on the timeline.  The only exception is for defending, which has no cast time; thus, when choosing a character's action, the player must decide whether it can be completed before an enemy attacks or whether it is best to be safe and defend, effectively forfeiting the turn.  Finally, Igniculus provides the flexibility of control: the player can position him over a single foe at a time, slowing it down as it cowers from his light.  This allows you to make tactical decisions constantly, changing a turn-based game into something much more directly involved.  Many of the best systems in videogames are very simple but allow for great depth, and Child of Light accomplishes this by providing lots of tools that can be used to manipulate the timeline.  The items that are hidden throughout the world are gems that confer attributes when equipped.  Some of these are standard RPG fare such as fire, water, and lightning offensive and defensive affinities, increased damage resistance or attack power, and bonuses to hit points and magic points, but the most useful—and interesting—gems affect the timeline.  Tourmaline grants attacks the possibility of paralyzing their targets, citrine yields a chance to set enemies back on the timeline, and spinel causes characters to begin every turn with a bump forward.  A crafting system allows the player to improve or transmute these gems as strategy requires.  The final piece of the puzzle is the characters' skills, which are quite varied.  In addition to the expected haste and slow effects, there are skills that set enemies back on the timeline, jump allies forward for a set number of turns, paralyze enemies for a given duration, and prevent interruption altogether during the cast phase.  Enemies provide their own interesting wrinkles, though; particularly later in the game, many will counter your interruptions with their own buffs, requiring you to alter your tactics and show restraint even when you have the opportunity to prevent them from acting.Dominating a group of dangerous enemies by carefully controlling the timeline is quite satisfying.  However, Child of Light, being a role-playing game, cannot be won through skill alone.  If you play on Expert difficulty—and you should, as Casual is too easy to allow you to experience the depth that its systems have to offer—you need to make thoughtful use of the gems that you find and craft while exploring, your different characters' skills, and your real-time ability to selectively slow enemies; but you also need the numbers to back that all up.  If your characters don't progress at a sufficient rate during their adventure, no amount of tactical mastery will make up for their statistical shortcomings.That's where the game's main design flaw comes into play.  To be fair, it's not entirely Child of Light's fault; this is a problem inherited from the long tradition of Japanese role-playing games.  While placing enemies within the game world for the player to avoid or engage at will happily eschews the standard exasperation of constant random battles, it represents a hypocrisy of intent since, while battles are made to appear optional, they really just aren't.  Taking advantage of this opportunity to avoid combat gradually puts players at an increasing disadvantage; those who are careful to circumvent what enemies they can will find their characters underpowered when they are forced to fight.  The ability to bypass battles sounds great on paper, but its implementation requires a more thoughtful approach for making it challenging to do so and for rewarding successful evasion with character progression to substitute for the experience that would have been gained through those battles.  For the player, the workaround is simple: make sure to fight enemies regularly throughout the game, even though you don't have to.  It's unfortunate and disingenuous for a game to indirectly force us to regulate our behavior like this, consciously preventing ourselves from taking advantage of an ostensibly viable gameplay option, but the problem does disappear in practice once one reconciles promise with reality.As you're likely to have noticed already, Child of Light is remarkably composed of watercolor art in motion.  It's gorgeous from the start and straight through for the entire 20 or so hours it lasts.  The score by Cœur de pirate, the stage name of musician and composer Béatrice Martin, infuses the game with the most pervasive melancholy, albeit one occasionally relieved by notes of triumph.  This music might actually be the strongest aspect of the entire game: it thoroughly characterizes the experience and often seems more profound than the fairy tale narrative warrants.The fundamental plot is clichéd, all evil stepmothers and light in the dark, but it is rescued in the telling due to the novelty of its rhymed verse.  Some may find it precious or cloying, but it charmed me.  While the writing can certainly come across as forced at times, it always arrives in bite-sized chunks, so no fault is ever severe.  There are plenty of dialogue exchanges that made me laugh or feel affection for the characters, and Child of Light plays with form by intentionally deviating from its rhyme in a couple of key moments.  Unfortunately, despite presenting a well-paced journey overall, the final moments of the game are rushed and sadly don't provide as satisfying a conclusion as they should.Although my opinion of Child of Light may sound measured in some respects, this is the result of taking a step back from the game to think about it critically; the truth is that I delighted in my time playing it.  Both established fans of RPGs and those curious enough to try a streamlined gateway into the genre should consider it highly recommended.			"

												Brilliant little turn based RPG Final Fantasy'esk game. I had been sitting on this game for a number of months since purchasing in the sale. I had often thought the graphics would not suite me, but they really are enchanting once you start playing. The colourful scenery, water effects, and lighting makes this a very pretty 2D game.  I really enjoyed the story. It wasn't too short, and wasn't too long, which some games sometime seem to suffer from. I wasn't too keen on the fact you don't really have a ""quest log"" to view all of your side quests, they all seem to get jumbled up in your item inventory, why, i have no idea?The combat system in very simple. Two of your party members fight up to three enemies at any one time. You can switch members around in the midst of combat so you can always try and get the advantage over the enemy.This game is really an enjoyment play through. 100% worth the price tag of £11,99, so if you can get it cheaper in a sale, you have yourself a huge bargin!

												Pretty game with great mechanic that is ultimately unsatisfying due to basic failures in storytelling.And not just dialog (which is terrible due to the misguided decision to frame everything in 5th-grade-love-poem-rhyming-couplets). Basic things. Like, never once did I know why I was doing anything. I had to get the sun. I had to get the stars. But why? What was at stake? Oh, I have a sister? When did that happen? I'm the daughter of a king but I don't want to be a princess? huh?There's a whole lot here. The game actually has a fair amount of backstory that it just completely fails to convey. Which is a shame. With a little basic storytelling competency, all these parts could have come together to be greater than their sum.As it is, it's a cute game with an unsatisfying endgame.			"

Child of Light is an amazing game. That's the short review. It does, however, have a major flaw: While the art design and turn-based combat system never disappoint, the story leaves much to be desired. Not in the journey, but in the ending.I do not want to get too into-detail so as not to spoil those who want to buy the game, but I will leave this warning: If you get attached to storylines and value proper closure and complete endings, this might be a game to avoid. The story flows incredibly well until the final stretch of the game, in which the developers sloppily attempted to wrap everything together. It honestly feels like they ran out of budget or time and had to quickly slap an ending on the game.If you value the journey more than the ending, have at it. It will not disappoint.			"

												First of all, I liked it :)This game is pretty much a fairytale and quite good at that.Story is heavy in this game and the visuals help a lot to set the wonderious atmosphere.And for a turnbased title the gameplay is quite involved and busy, which is a good thing!I dont really want to go into too much detail as that would spoil things.My only real-ish complaint with the game is that while it does take you about 12 hours to complete, the ending feels a bit rushed.Regarding gameplay:While you have like 8 characters, you can only use 2 at a time in battle, if they would allow 3 at a time I think that would fundamentally (in a good way) change the game but 2 works fine.I would have also liked a bit more information here and there, for example.You can add Gems to your weapons to give them elemental properties, but you have to remember which character you gave what as it does not show up anywhere but in their equipment.Its a bit hard to explain but I wish there was like an Icon or something next to their name showing the element or gem they have equiped so the player does not have to remember that when in battle where its important to know that.But its a good game I would pretty much recommend to anyone, if you are thinking about buying it I would recommened getting the Golem DLC as well as it adds a new character and dialogue which is good stuff :)			"

												Clearly a game worthy of its price, reduction or not.Pros :- The game is surprisingly long. With that kind of game you would usually expect about 5 hours of lifetime. This one will take you approximately 15-20 hours to reach the end, unless you rush it like an idiot. If you like to complete games to 100%, you can add another 10 hours to that already long lifetime.- The combat system is nice. It's strongly inspired from the one from Final Fantasy but with some extra mechanisms like the possibility to interrupt or be interupting during the casting time of an action, the possibility to slow down a specific opponent using your mouse, etc.- The graphics are really sweet, colorful and yet sober.- There are plenty of little things hidden here and there that will push you to explore every place in order to find them. These hidden things can be gemstones or various bonuses, poems or even new hidden characters that can join your group. This is something that we used to see a lot a decade ago in games like Zelda OoT and that we see less and less in nowadays videos games where exploration is not rewarding you.Cons :- Sometimes you have to solve enigmas by doing some specific actions to advance in the level. These enigmas are not bad, but they are very simple to solve and are rather redundant. Must of the time it's pushing/pulling a box to the right place or using your mouse to create a shadow on a wall and aim it at something.- The gem combination system itself is nice, but the game doesn't provide enough information about it. You can hardly know what are the possible combinations unless you look them up on wikis or find them by luck.- You're forced to install and use Uplay to play the game. I already have enough crap on my computer, I don't really like being forced to install another privacy invading game client that sucks extra RAM on my PC just to play a game. Steam is already enough.			"

												Child of Light is that game that every gamer should play just to relax, listening to it's awesome soundtracks and to realize in the process that even small games deserve much appreciation. Now, the game is in 2D, portraying great art style of a land ruled by a Dark Queen and her forces which you as a Child of Light must fight to return peace to it's inhabitants. The story might sound very familiar but what must be taken into account is the way it is told. The pacing is precise and the dialogues are well written. The gameplay is simple and enjoyable, moving around and exploring different areas of the land of lemuria, collecting various items, turn-based fighting various enemies and a few bosses here and there, leveling up your character, crafting occuli (gems combined for various effects applicable to gear), solving a few simple puzzles and completing few side quests. The game length is around 20hrs if not rushed. I find it real value as the game is beautifully done overall. WHY YOU SHOULD GET THIS:+ Epic soundtrack, especially during fights+ Visual Design+ RPG/ Turn-Based style of gameplay+ Party management + Well paced story and events that can move your heart + Not too long and not too shortNEGATIVES:- Light vs Dark story is enjoyable but we've heard it before (not a big negative)- More side quests and more bosses/enemy variety would have been awesomeOVERALL:  85/100			"

Your new partner will help you to slow down one enemy or heal the wound of one of your partner at time using its own power. You will need the mouse? or the right controller stick to move him. You'll then have a lot of friends to help you in your journey. All of them including you have their own skills, and a 3-branch skill tree to master. You can only use 2 character at time but can switch to another one when one of your ally is about to be ready.Also during your quest you'll find some occuli shards, which after being crafted are stronger than before. Every occuli have its own power depending of the color and the size of it. An Occuli can be equipped to one of the three slots of each character. Finally Occulis have a different powers depending on which slot they are assigned.The game difficulty can be set to normal or hard mode whenever you want. The hard mode makes mostly bosses becoming real bosses as you'll need to be smarter than them. Some boss may be frustrating but preparing a strategy will help a lot to slay them all.The game doesn't stop there. Indeed the game features some puzzles about a dozen where you need to use the help of your firefly friend or use some objects to interact with. There is also a whole new world to discover revealing some 'confessions' which are the game's collectibles, star dust (item that can instantly increase one stat of any ally), treasure chests (that may have occuli shards or potions), quests givers (several), lots of foes and many healing plants.I can only strongly recommend you that game if you love RPG games !Perhaps one of the most frustrating mechanism of the game is the interuption feature. If your character is hit by a foe while casting a spell or only using a potion, he is interupted and pushed backward. But you can hope that the other ally will be hit or defend yourself waiting for the right time. You can also always rely on your firefly friend. So there is almost always a way to avoid that.			"

												Child of light is a very nicely designed turn-based RPG which is told in the form of a poem. The storytelling really adds to the beauty of the game. There's lots to explore and many ways to walk your path. Besides the main story there are a few side missions you can do that can give you some nice bonus items. As you progress in the game multiple characters will join your party (some by doing side missions) who each have their own skilltree to upgrade, they all have their own perks making certain characters of your party essential in combat. I really recommend this game to everyone I know, it's really heart warming and very fun to play!			"

												Very unique and enchanting experience. It feels like an ""Americanized JRPG"" and I mean that as a full compliment. The art pulls you into the world, and the combat system is solid, and it's varying difficulties make it welcoming for new players and experts alike. The combat rarely seems like a 'grind' with level ups happening frequently and your characters showing almost constant growth. The level of detail, polish, and absolute love put into this game by its creators really shows.Also, I think it's a steal at only $15 (the price at the time of this review). Any sale price below that makes this a 'must get'.---------A few notes: with the exception of ""The Golem's Plight"", the DLC is all bull, don't bother. Golem's Plight adds an extra character into the game (about an hour and a half into the game) who is useful, but certainly not necessary as the experience would still feel ""complete"" without it. For the other DLC, you get 'Oculi' as rewards in combat, kinda like money in most JRPGs. It's just a waste to buy it. Also, uPlay sucks, blah blah blah, but you knew that.			"

												Child of Light is an interesting game, but unfortunately it just isn't very fun. As other reviewers have said, the art is incredible. The combat, however, is a mix of frustrating and boring - not a good pair of attributes to blend in a game that's heavily focused on leveling up. Child of Light is a good thing to watch, but it just isn't very fun to play.Unlike many JRPGs, this game has gorgeous art and an actually interesting story. Each of your party members has a unique skill tree, as well as some unique dialog to carry you through the game. The story is told in bits of conversation, scraps of poetry, and the overall world design. In a way, it invokes the same sort of feeling as the much-vaunted Dark Souls: the game does not make you sit through pages of dialog, but the story is in the world if you want it. You don't need to pay attention to it if you don't want to, though, which is also nice. Most quests come as side quests, so you can comfortably ignore whatever you like.Levels are open and interesting, with enough nooks and crannies to keep exploration interesting. The game - on normal difficulty - loads you down with potions and other consumables, so even though you don't need the loot, it's still fun to get. You'll enjoy the light / dark theme that plays out in each level. Child of Light uses a few basic light mechanics (shadows, brightness, etc) over and over, but it still feels relatively fresh since the puzzles are kept very simple.Unfortunately, the combat is just unpleasant. In the beginning of the game, I enjoyed it, but by the end, I was desperately avoiding combat because it just took too long and was too frustrating.The mechanics of combat have been described by many other reviewers, so I won't re-tread that ground. The interrupt mechanic is just poorly implemented, and whenever you get interrupted (which will happen a LOT), the game continues to yell at you that using the Defend option will ""prevent interruption"". It doesn't. Defend skips your turn in exchange for increasing your defense and giving yourself a speed boost towards the cast meter. Defend does not prevent skill interruption, and I spent the first couple of hours frustrated that the game was telling me otherwise.With the gems (occuli) slotted, each of your fighters becomes specialized. So for each combat, you have a choice. You can either hit for low damage (i.e. using a Earth gem versus a Fire creature does no bonus damage) and immediately get countered for 3-6 times your damage. Or, you can swap out characters over and over. While you're doing this, you're continually getting interrupted and stunlocked. Defend, as I explained above, won't fix the issue since you ultimately will need to attack at some point.I really didn't enjoy the combat at all.			"

IntroductionAlright so Child of Light, interesting game, I won't go in to overly pretentious detail about what you can expect from this game in terms of artistic style because let's face it, it's all subjective, if you like what you see, then you're already interested. I'm not here to tempt you in to appreciating it's art style, I'm just here to give you the facts of what you can expect. However I will warn you that all the dialog is spoken in riddles and poems that rhyme... just let that sink in. It's not like you really have to pay attention to the story any way, it's fairly cliche drivel that you've seen before... If you've seen any Disney princess movie then you already know what to expect.How does it play? / Overall ImpressionsWell it starts off as you'd expect from watching trailers and such, a 2D platformer with RPG elements, leveling up, skill trees and a huge party roster, half of which won't get much, if any, exposure due to novelty or situational skill set they have. The problem with this game is the pacing... You think it's going to be kind of clunky and slow to start but shortly after the first boss encounter (about an hour in) you gain the ability to fly. Once you have this ability, that's it, you can pretty much traverse all the terrain in the game, there is no place out of reach. I foud this rather odd and it was a tad overwhelming. There is no limit on the amount of time you can fly either, like you literally just jump in the air, press the jump button again and that's it, flight mode... Another point of note is that there are locked doors in the first couple areas, these doors can never be opened so don't bother wasting your time. There's nothing behind them and you never get a key or a side quest for them... just locked buildings for the sake of it...This gave me the impression that this game was rushed, and upon further inspection, I think it kind of was, the end of the game just seems to kind of hit you really hard and fast and I never really felt like there was a ""long way to go""... I finished it in just under 12 hours, two sittings, fairly short game, but again, it's 15 dollars. Honestly I'm not sure why this game is getting 9's and 10's... To be fair and honest, it's more like a 7 but I've found some pretty heinous glitches in it which lowered it's score for me to around a 6.5 / 10... It definitely needed more polish.That doesn't mean it's a bad game or a game not worth playing, but there are just some things I can't overlook when it comes to video games... I'm a bit of a stickler for poor design and glitches that ruin my over all experience... Enthrall me with a story as much as you want, it's still a video game in the end, not a movie... So when things are bugging out, I can't overlook it.Obnoxious Bugs / Glitches To Look Out ForAs you may or may not know, this game has a BUTT LOAD of collectible items in it, and the game conveniently keeps track of all of this stuff, you have 16 letters to collect, over 400 treasure chests and around 50 upgrade items. Here's where the fun stops...So I'm fairly O.C.D. when it comes to getting 100% in games, especially one as simple as this, so I felt up to the challenge, unfortunately there were a few isntances where I wanted to smash something.If you initiate the battle sequence (touch an enemy) while opening a chest or collecting an item the game will glitch. Upon exiting the battle the chest will be open / the item will be gone from the map, the problem is you won't have collected it. Instead you have to re-open the open chest or re-collect the item again even though it is no longer visible. BE CAREFUL!In the final area of the game there are 97 chests to collect but Ubisoft forgot how to count and placed 98 chests in this area and one of them doesn't count towards your final total... I'm not sure if not collecting it will count against you, I just found it to be a nightmare while following a collection guide... I knew I had opened 24 chests in the first area but the game said I had 23... just another warning.Is The DLC Worth It?No. Do not throw extra money at this game, it isn't worth a cent. There's an extra character you can buy for 3 dollars named Golem, he's not worth it. He's the strongest physical fighter in the game and the best tank but he's so slow all he's good for is being a damage sponge... Basically his utility is crap. The best party in the game is Aurora and Finn, main DPS / Buffer and a Magic Nuker... that's all you need to win.The other DLC items include giving you various combinations of stat upgrades and gems to combine so you can enhance your characters powers, you'll learn about that as you play... Don't buy them. If you're desperate for gems, just hack the value's in cheat engine, problem solved. Don't throw extra money at Ubisoft for junk.Final ThoughtsIt's a decent little RPG title if you're craving some good old school turn based action, the party is unfortunately small though, two characters max... Reminds me of FInal Fantasy Mystic Quest, really basic... but still fun. My biggest issue is that some of the characters wind up under utilized or not used at all, for a game that bolsters a cast of over 8 characters, it's a bit ridiculous. Again the game felt really rushed like it could of been twice as long or had twice as much effort / thought put in to it but they seemed to just toss this thing out there.People claiming this is a 9 / 10 game are seriously wearing blinders, it's no where near a perfect game, in fact it's quite flawed. I am recommending it though because you will enjoy some of the RPG elements it has to offer, even though it's easily exploited. It doesn't take much to complete it, a couple 6 hours sessions and you'll have it done in a weekend so it isn't a huge time sink. I wouldn't pay 15 dollars for it though, try to get it on sale from Humble Bundle or GMG for 10 bucks at most.Final Score6.5 / 10+ Looks good+ Gameplay is solid (Good balance of exploration, puzzles and battling)+ Fun battle system, albeit simple+ Lots of characters to choose from+ Interesting design- Felt Rushed (Locked doors you can never open, ability to fly given too soon)- Not a good time to price ratio (too short)- Bugs and glitches still not fixed (O.C.D. Nightmare)- Story is cliche, nothing new here.- Wasted Potential (Big character roster, two character party max)- Uplay....*puke* (I already have a main game client, I don't need yours Ubisoft)Get it on sale.

												I'm not a fan of side scrolling games but this one is worth it especially for the price. The turn-based battles are fun and have alot of depth which starts to shine in the end-game. The graphics are charming and the physics have a real ""umph"" to them. Especially the protagonists hair.			"

Posted: December 7, 2014
												Child of Light is a turn-based roleplaying game with a very distinctive pseudo-storybook graphical style, written entirely in rhyme. Many of its mechanics are reminiscent of Final Fantasy X – including some painful dialogue.Gameplay	The game consists of two portions: environmental navigation and battle.	Environmental navigation is actually a bit tiresome; at the start of the game, the player can only walk and jump, but very soon they gain the ability to fly around the 2D environment, eliminating all of the platforming elements in the game very early. This has a somewhat negative influence on gameplay speed, the player must explore an environment from top to bottom to find all the items and secrets, greatly increasing the amount of space which needs to be explored. In parts, it works decently well, but frequently it is tiresome, and only a few environments full of puzzles and traps are even remotely interesting to navigate.	There are no random encounters in the game; rather, monsters appear and wander around on the screen, and will attempt to pursue the player if they see them. The player will be “ambushed” if the monster runs into them while their back is turned, and will ambush the monster in turn if they manage to run into the monster’s back. This means that most of the time, the player will ambush the monsters, as not only is navigation simple, but the player controls a small ball of light which can be used to temporarily stun the monsters, in addition to healing the player between combats and activating some switches and puzzles	The game’s combat is actually reasonably sophisticated. The player controls two characters in combat, and faces off with up to three enemies at a time. It is somewhat reminiscent of Final Fantasy X in many respects; the player can switch out their characters at any time during combat, including replacing KOed characters with another character, and different attacks have different speeds. However, unlike Final Fantasy X, there are two different speeds which matter: the base speed of the character, and the speed at which the character acts.	There are two portions of a gauge at the bottom of the screen; the first portion represents the time spent between turns, while the second, smaller section represents the time spent charging up to attack or perform some other action. Each action has its own speed through the second portion of this, and if someone is attacked while they are charging an action, their action is interrupted and their turn is reset into some random (or semi-random) portion of the between-turns section of the gauge. As such, the player can interrupt enemy attacks, or the enemies can interrupt player attacks. There are some means of protecting yourself from such things, and some monsters will automatically counterattack against certain types of attacks (physical or magical) or against attacks made while they’re charging their actions.	The characters are actually quite varied, with each character having their own skill-set which is unlocked via a character-specific skill tree. Each character has their own set of abilities, and there are two characters who are primarily magic users, a warrior who can force enemies to attack him, a character who focuses entirely on speeding up or slowing down allies and enemies, a couple of physical attack characters, and some support characters. Gauge manipulation, interrupting enemy attacks, exploiting enemy elemental vulnerabilities, and applying the right status ailments while keeping your own party healthy are all important. The ball of light you control while navigating the levels also appears here, and can be used to slow down enemies or heal your allies – it is almost always better to slow enemies, though, as that prevents them from doing damage (and makes it easier to interrupt them) much more than healing yourself does.	Unfortunately, after a while, the battles become a bit routine; while the first set of enemies in an area are new and fresh, after a while they become very routine and can be defeated via a very samey set of actions in the same way that Final Fantasy X fights often went. This makes many of the fights in the game fairly dull, and while they’re skippable, the bosses, which are much more difficult, basically require you to beat every other enemy in the game so that you’re the proper level to face them.	The boss encounters tend to be the highlight of the game; they’re the most enjoyable bits of it, and tend to be a bit different from other encounters, mostly in that the bosses and their companions tend to be more dangerous, quicker, and more prone to retaliation and inflicting annoying status ailments that require you to actually think on your feet. Even still, I got through the game without getting a single game over, and I suspect that most players will do so as well; indeed, I was left with an overabundance of items at the end of the game and used them with wild abandon against the final boss, as I had hardly used any prior to that point.	There is also an equipment system, in which craftable, equippable gems which are acquired over the course of the game are put into slots and have various static effects on a character and their statistics; these can be used to add elemental damage types to physical attacks, grant bonus damage, make a character tougher or more resilient, or even increase the rate of xp gain.While this system seems neat in theory, I had the xp-gain gems equipped to my characters’ body slots for the entire game, and never needed to remove them to mitigate damage. Moreover, I pretty much figured out exactly how I was supposed to equip all of my characters quite early and from there on out it was just a matter of marginally improving my equipment over time – not the most exciting thing in the world, but it gave some sense of progression.Presentation	The game is reasonably well-presented; the game tries to go for a sort of storybook style, with the characters appearing almost like paper cut-outs or things from a storybook, and the monsters having a similar stylized character. The music and sound are both reasonable enough, but a lot of the dialogue – delivered entirely in rhyme – is pretty awful. Sometimes it works well, but other times it falls down and is kind of painful to read.Final Summary	Child of Light is not a bad game, but it isn’t exactly thrilling either. Everything about it is a decent enough idea, but in practice, it only shines on rare occasion. The game takes on the order of 20 hours to complete, and has no replay value; while there is a new game + mode, there is little reason to play it.			"

												Child of Light is a beautiful game with great fantasy and great soundtrack. The art is too beautiful to be true for 10 bucks game. But unfortunately the game mechanism is too painful and lack of creativity. It's like ure gonna spend all of ur time to find the treasure and along the way u have to fight countless monster again and again till the end of the game but u will ALWAYS looks weak bcs its not balanced (the monster). I found it so painful that i dont even want to retry the game with a new difficulty or keep playing it after i finished the game. The story was good BUT it really lacks of explanation of what really happened on the game, in most of situation they just point out the problem and then the problem were resolved, and almost all of the dialogue is filled with boring poetry that u dont even bother to read it, the art is so so so so wonderful, stunning, eye catchy or (anything that describes amazing), but as i said the mechanism is too painful. I would still love to recommend this game bcs the art is really really really worth the pain and it is something that RPG player should experience. For me it's 8.5/10.			"

												I enjoy this game! It's relatively intuitive as far as controls go, the art style is beautiful, and the game itself is very touching. My only complaint is the screen in which two characters are talking (similar to how JRPGs have conversations in visual novels). The dialogue does not always show up, so I've missed a good portion of the story so far, being on chapter three already.Everything else is great. The battle system is classic, and everything about it is endearing.			"

												This is a real gem of a game!As a light-weight RPG with tactical combat and including some light-weight platforming elements, this game is perfect for nearly any age and well-suited for the young who are exploring RPGs for the first time. The learning curve is low, characters easy to manage, and the entire game is controller-friendly. Combat is simplified by not having to choose weapons and armor, yet fun because the tactical element requires you to stay on your toes.The mechanics of the game might be too easy for more experienced gamers, but there is a hard mode to make fights more challenging. The story is an engaging fairy tale that is like playing through an interactive children's book. Aurora is a spunky and thoroughly likable main protagonist, wandering through the magical land of Lemuria trying to help its people and in the process trying to find her way back home (a palace in Austria) where her father, The Duke, has taken gravely ill.What follows is an adventure full of danger and camaraderie. Aurora is predominantly a spell-caster but can hold her own in physical combat with her sword. Other NPCs that join the party fill out the roles of magician, healer, archer, buffer, tank, and crowd control. Each character has a skill tree with three branches that can advance abilities via points granted with leveling up. It's impossible to max out anyone's tree in the first play-through, so the player can exercise some control over what they want their characters to do best. There is also a simple crafting system that isn't too grindy and allows the use of gemstones to augment skills and stats.The art and music are gorgeous. The violence is underplayed in keeping with the children's story theme. The length is perfect for the tale being told and never seems to drag. My recommendation is don't rush through. Stop and enjoy the scenery, and explore everything because there's lots of hidden treasures to find that help with crafting and battle. As an added treat, a second person can grab a controller and play as Igniculus (a talking ball of light) who assists Aurora's group in battle, solves light-based puzzles, and can reach items that are not accessible otherwise. In solo, he is controlled by the other thumbstick.This game has no Steam achievements, which is a shame. But that's because it's UPlay.Rating: 8/10Fun for ALL ages! Might be a bit easy for hardcore RPG fans. "

												Child of Light is an extremely gorgeous piece of work. From its method of storytelling to its stunning visuals and appropriately airy and pleasant orchestral soundtrack, everything about this game's presentation ties together like a fine piece of poetry. Sure, the writing is a little clumsy at times, and they reeeeally stretch the language to hit the nail on the head for some of those rhymes (see what I did there?), but the heart is there and that's why Child of Light shines as brightly as it does. It just has a ton of heart and love in it and its creators' care for the project shines through and is ultimately infectious. Child of Light's RPG elements are heavily inspired by Game Arts' Grandia series. Combat plays out with all characters assigned a spot on a timeline at the bottom of the screen. When a character or enemy hits a specific point on the timeline, they are then allowed to act. If a character or enemy is successfully attacked in the moments before their action is carried out, their attack is interrupted and they are pushed back on the timeline to hopefully try again. Combat mostly boils down to who can control the timeline better with their attacks or employing dirty tricks like slow down spells or status effects that inhitibt a character's movement on the timeline. All of the game's random battles have this strategic element, and boss fights even more so, which makes encounters not feel so mashy as RPGs can tend to be.Combat is enhanced further by the way you customize your characters. Level ups grant skill points that you can spend on skill trees to grow your characters toward the stats and moves you want the most, though there's never any need to maximize any one part of a skill tree if you want your characters to do a little bit of everything. The Oculi system helps customization further by allowing you to imbue your characters with elemental attacks, defenses, and abilities to alter their or their enemy's stats on the timeline. These aren't the deepest systems ever, but they add enough depth to keep the character progression important.  So yeah, Child of Light is pretty awesome. Its only flaws are that it can be a tad too easy (I HIGHLY recommend throwing the difficulty up to Expert as soon as you have the ability to) and a character or two don't quite get their chances to shine in the story before the game wraps up. Other than that, fans of JRPGs will be incredibly happy with what Child of Light has to offer with its engrossing story, beautiful world, and solid RPG mechanics.  "

												Child of Light is brilliant. The artistic value of this game is remarkable: the hand-painted backgrounds are stunningly beautiful, the orchestrated soundtrack is melodious and enchanting. Everything together makes you feel like you're really in a fairy tale. Exploring (or better, flying over) Lemuria is an absorbing experience, I think I'll never get tired of it.Fortunately, under the huge artistic value there's a good game. The RPG mechanics are simple, yet engaging. There are no random encounters: you can see the enemies on the map and decide whether to engage them or not. The combat system feels like a good ol' jRPG, revolving around anticipating/interrupting the enemies and party members swapping. You can also use your little firefly Igniculus to slow down enemies and heal yourself, adding a layer of complexity to the combat mechanics. This system feels fresh through the entire length of the game, so you'll just find yourself willingly engaging all the enemies, since fighting them is fun.Even though everything seems swell and nice, Child of Light has some problems. Aurora is the only fleshed out and likeable character. The other characters are just... there, they don't make a difference. The whole game is written in rhyme, which seems cool, but it's not: the metric is all over the place, it's not consistent at all. In the end it didn't bother me, but it could bother you. The plot is simple, a standard (maybe a bit darker) fairy tale plot. I liked it anyway, it's a good justification to explore Lemuria and to flesh out Aurora's personality, but if you're seeking a complex plot you're looking at the wrong game.In the end, is it worth 15 euro? Absolutely, it's worth more than that. We need more games like Child of Light, we need more middle ground between Indie and AAA titles. If you're on the fence, it's time to jump and buy this game. ;0			"

I would put this on the same level as Okami for aesthetic value :) Yes, the rhyming does feel forced (because it is) especially during the dialogue, but that just adds to the quirky-ness of the Lemurian world. I found the battle system interesting. It took me a while to get used to because I'd never played a game with this timer-turn-based strategy system (though I'm sure it's not the first of its kind). But once I got the hang of how it worked, I was surprised, and elated, by how thoughtful your moves need to be, particularly in boss battles, to be successful and effective. However, you could certainly get through this game by simply throwing your most powerful moves at the monsters, you just won't be nearly as efficient. Some may consider that a downside to the game, but I think it is an upside: you can progress through and enjoy the story whether you want to play strategically or not, allowing more skill levels to be able to enjoy the game.There is also a significant amount of exploring you can do to find bonuses, which I simply loved. This game exceeded my expectations in every way, and I would highly recommend it to anyone! As of this review (about 16 hours of gameplay), I have completed the main plot and all of the side quests (that I have found anyway), but I still have a bit more exploration to do to find the remaining hidden items in all the areas.I did experience a few glitches, such as Aurora's hair disappearing during battles and visual stutters near the end of the game, but nothing that effected gameplay.

												I bought the game around 2 weeks ago. I was forced to create a stupid Uplay account and the experience was tedious. I did not think it was a big deal as I believed this was only because it's my first UPlay product.I came back 2 weeks later to try the game and here I am - forced to wait for a stupid UPlay update! As if the frequest daily Steam updates are not enough!If Ubisoft want to publish on Steam, then they should get rid of UPlay and integrate their products directly in Steam. I don't like being punished for using Steam, let alone for buying an original product :)			"

												It's literally like playing a bed time fantasy story. Also everyone talks in rythmes, how can you resist it's charm? Aside from the cute story the gameplay is pretty neat too, if you are a fan of classic final fantasy game the gameplay is similar to those, leveling your character and party, gearing them up with different gems, and strategic battles where timing is very important.

												Child of Light starts off as being Game of The Year that has one of the most superb accomplishments of trails in the RPG genre that essentially presents what all games have perfectly accomplished in a better way even,  A game that I haven't been complaining upon the beginning. but unfortunately ends up towards a meaningful word of true disappointment - Avoids its gorgeous, overtakes saturation of balance; regardless. The great combinition Ubisoft Montréal has built with Child of Light of beautiful art design, wonderfully developed gameplay, music that plays feelings....build up a game that obviously inspires sorrow emotions. A masterpiece given world to players that contains amazing fantasy creatures. Levelling up system which is sort of traditional of theory more than satisfying though. Crafting which I felt a bit of 'unnecessary much' from the plenty amount of same items encountered with each random and every chest. howerever, satisfying for a small add. Although Child of Light is great, recovers some elements of Journey and confidently overcomes games attempting to make this approach. but it doesn't seem that worth playing towards 'ending up' somehow unfortunately left me with disappointments that it can very simply avoid rather than. indeed.7.4/10 Good			"

												No matter how good a game is, or how much I enjoy/enjoyed it, I normally don't feel compelled to write a review for it. But, man...this game. After nearly having a coronary from Dark Souls 2, Child of Light was a very welcome respite that just melted the rage away. The music is well done and the evironments are beautiful (the giant walking in the background near the starting part of the game was a very nice touch), and the dialogue is fun (but maybe that's just the English major in me talking, even though I've never been much of a poet). The gameplay itself is straight forward and easy to get a handle on while still requiring a bit of forethought and attention. It's also kind of refreshing to have a little girl who is undoubtedly strong in her own right as the main character. Haven't finished the game yet, no idea how far in I am, but I did have to force myself to stop playing so I could stretch things out over the course of a few days instead of greedily devouring it all at once.Unlike what seems to be a majority of people, I haven't had any problems with the UPlay aspect (with this game or with Far Cry 3 or Might and Magic) so that isn't an issue for me.I also bought all the Day 1 DLC just to spite the a-holes who throw hissy fits about it. So let me end this pleasant review of an excellent game by saying to the haters: lol u mad?			"

												I got this game last year during the summer sale and didn't have time to play until now.I loved everything about this game. The story was well written and it was very easy to get myself lost in it and putting myself in Aurora's shoes. I got a bit emotional with the story near the end (cuz I'm a wuss) but it just goes to show just how well the story was written. Visually, I loved the simple yet colourful watercolour-like artwork and each new area of the world had a different characteristic to the art. The music is just outstanding, especially the end credits song. The only drawback I can think of about this game is that it requires uplay. While it is not game-breaking, it does get annoying have uplay open and clutters up my desktop screen.			"

Child of Light ReviewChild. Tuck yourself in bedAnd let me tell a storyOf Lemuria, a long lost kingdom,And a girl born for glory.Child of Light is a RPG produced by Ubisoft Montreál, released in April of 2014. In this game you embark in a journey, playing as Aurora, a young princess whose soul is brought to the Kingdom of Lemuria. On this journey, you will have to recover the three sources of light and defeat the Black Queen in order to restore the Kingdom of Lemuria.Aspects Of The Game:•	An exhillarating and tranquilizing mix of music. •	A beautifully executed simple story. •	Hand drawn art.•	A classic blend of RPG elements in a side scroller.•	Turn-based combat.•	Great side-characters.•	A delightful main lead.•	An agape world called Lemuria with alot of adventure.GameplayIn terms of gameplay it is a good game.The combat mechanics are pretty simple. However, you need to think your actions well in order to act in the best and fastest way as possible. At the start you will play solo, but with time you will find many interesting and strong allies which will help you, by forming a party of 2 characters during the battles. You also have a firefly as an ally, which you control with the mouse. A pretty interesting mechanic but it becomes pretty repetitive during the combats. Out of combat it is an simple 2D platform game, with some puzzles, traps and tons of hidden loot. Sadly, in terms of combat, the game becomes extremely repetitive in the second half of the game because at some point, excluding boss battles, you will repeat the same tactics over and over again since the variety of enemies is pretty low. It gets so repetitive that at some point, you will start avoiding your enemies instead of attacking them to earn experience. You also have a perk system, as expected in a RPG, which is also pretty simple, yet intuitive. There is also a gem system called Oculi, that gives you the chance to upgrade certain stats of your characters.StoryThe story in this game is told in an extremely simple way, yet that is part of the beauty of it. It is a very sad story with some unexpected plot twists, supported by excellent characters and good dialogues, except the fact that they always rhyme, something that really grinded my gears, especially during the second half of the game because the rhymes start to feel too forced. Apart from that, it is an excellent tale of the journey made by the protagonist Aurora, in her attempt to save the Kingdom of Lemuria.VisualsVisually this is an epic game. The game art is absolutely astonishing, it really gives life to this wonderful fantasy world. Everything as an immaculate aspect, it is hard not to like the artistic work made in this game. Another highlight is the fact that this game as the ""feeling"" that all was hand crafted, as if the game was drawn on a canvas. Really spectacular in this category.Music and SoundsThe biggest strength in this game is the soundtrack. Absolutely amazing! It is hard to not be immersed in this awesome world with this wonderful combo of visuals and sounds. Simply astonishing. The sound and music gives the strength and energy you need to play this game, really inspirational.Pros:•	Wonderful visuals•	Intuitive combat system•	Amazing soundtrack•	Beautiful storyCons:•	Combat is repititive.•	Not much replay value.Almost every aspect of Child of Light is amazing.I don't regret buying it.Really worth the money.It's a great work of art.My Rating: 9.0/10 "

												Child of Light is a 2d Metroidvania turn-based RPG in which a young Princess, named Aurora, wakes up in a mythical land known as Lemuria. In order to return home she needs to find the powers of the Sun and Moon but a sinister plot gets in her way. She finds creatures from all walks of life to help her in her journey, each with their own special power.The artwork is really really good especially if you have an affinity for oil based and watercolor style paintings. The game worked perfectly with my Xbox360 controller and a 2nd player can control Igniculus the firefly with a mouse or 2nd controller too. The combat is a mildly complex paper-rock-scissors system (almost exactly like South Park: Stick of Truth) which has a timeline that shows which order the characters/monsters will attack (much like the Grandia games). It can be difficult to use in the beginning but by the end of the game nothing stood a chance against me even on expert. There is a skill tree that has 3 branching paths/playstyles for each character. There is also a crafting system for gems (Oculi) that you can equip on the character's weapon, armor or accessory to give it different effects and bonuses. There isn't much complexity in terms of platforming seeing as how you get the ability to fly early on and from there it's about not getting hurt by environmental hazards. It's a well made and beautiful game with a fitting classical-hybrid soundtrack. One thing that might be off-putting for people is the dialog, written in poetry form with rhyming. I got used to it though and found it less annoying the more I played. I played it for about 8 hours my first time through and got sidetracked with other stuff and stopped. I came back to it 2 years later and finished the game with ~16 hours logged in on my save file. Was it worth the $15 I paid for it? Yes. I'd say this is a pretty solid game well worth the asking price but even better if you can get it on sale.			"

												The moment I started playing this game, I was in awe with the beautiful art style. The music and visuals are absolutely gorgeous. I immediately thought about Dust, another game I enjoy, except the battle system is more turn based. But that doesn't mean the battle system was bad, it's really quite fun. The music is beautiful, definitely one I enjoy. Over-all, this is a wonderful game, done in a fantastic way that feels like an interactive storybook.			"

												It has been quite some time, since a game caught me, suched me in, and made me even loose sleep over it. This cute game, with it's fairy tale atmosphere and story, has succeeded in doing exactly that.I recommend it very much, and I hope there will be more games made in the same spirit as this one.As for the game, it is mostly a puzzle game, a game for exploring every nook of this sad yet uplifting world, and also a sort of turn based fighting game. The mix of exploring, fighting and crafting better occulus fits me greatly. With characters, or rather, companions, with individuality to booth, a lovely score, somewhat familiare story and lovely artwork I have not quite seen in any other game, this one has been on my ""I must Get that game!""-list since I accidently saw it on youtube. And yeasterday (and today) I am finally taking time to play it.In fact, playing it in my winter night/dim room, with the snow outside and silence surrounding me, echoes to the mood set in the game.The question I am left with is; How can such a sad game yet feel uplifting?And that, I guess, sums the brilliance with Child of Light.

												Child of Light is a beautiful looking game. It's a sweet, sweet game and a nice piece of art.The story is interesting enough and the dialog is an amazing crafted piece of lyric poetry, managing this way to keep all characters relevant and very charismatic.It is an easy game, with a bit of support for a second player (think a young child or someone really new to games) to be your sidekick and aid you in your adventure.This game has a wonderful production. Everything is beautiful in this game: the scenarios, the music, the characters, the story, the dialog... it's impossible not to be in love with it.The gameplay itself is simple enough and the game is also a bit easy.I totally recommend it, this game has a lot of heart.Final ThoughtsI loved this game, it has a lot of heart. It was a beautiful experience from the start till the end.Highly recommended! "

												Child of Light left me delightfully entertained at every turn. With beautiful backgrounds, lovely music, and a fun twist on the standard turn-based style of game play, it provides a  comfortably level of challenge as you learn to balance the timing of your attacks and how you delay you delay your enemies. The story is fun, even if a little predictable. The rhyming conversations between characters (and lack there of for one) is a cute little detail for this storybook style adventure.My main complaint for it is that, despite gathering quite a few companions on the journey, you are limited to two characters in fights (two in a have if you want to count your friendly little firefly). That said, it is balanced by the free swap out, if you even need to do so (casual really did not require it, but the more challenging mode might).			"

												Yes, it uses uPlay, but the game is so great I need to recommend it anyway. Regarding uPlay: When it functions how it's intended to (as it did for me), after you set up an account and register the game via CD key, the game launches straight from Steam, and just leaves the uPlay window in the background. After some simple settings, the only interaction you need to have with it is closing the window when you quit the game.Regarding the game: It's a pseudo-real-time turn-based RPG set in a fairy tale world, wrapped up in a fairy tale story with fairy tale narration. Everything is in rhyme, and while the story really isn't too complex or gripping, it has a gentle nostalgic feel to it. The timing of the combat adds a fresh twist to the stale formula JRPGs have used forever, making each battle feel more real and alive.The cast is diverse, yet the characters are flat- I didn't especially care for any of them, and there was one in particular that just got on my nerves. But the simplicity of their design fits in nicely with the simplicity of the story, and they each have their own little story which helps flesh out the world a little more.To put it simply- This game is like playing through a bedtime story. For the most part, there isn't much depth, but the game doesn't lead you to believe otherwise. All it asks of you is that you listen, you enjoy, and you embrace this enchanted world. It's a great, simple experience.			"

So good that I played it twice, back to back!Child of Light reminds me in some ways of Studio Ghibli movies: they have a childish aesthetic but are more mature in story and tone. There is an unmistakable somber quality throughout Child of Light, something I wouldn't have expected from a game with a whimsical watercolor art style. This game excels at bringing together elements from various genres and fusing them together into a shining example of innovation for the industry.Let me list a few of the highlights of the game before I get into a few critiques. This is a gorgeous game, like a living painting with fantastic use of color, interesting inhabitants and exquisite backgrounds. The music stood out from the start and meshed perfectly with the overall tone. The combat showed its depth when I got my greatest enjoyment out of it during my second time through (New Game+ on Hard). A simple but satisfying crafting system allows for customization without too much complexity. Dialogue written in poetry combined with a chapter structure and occasional video cutscenes all add to the moving storybook feel of the game.Unfortunately this game is not perfect. Some of my complaints, particularly the first one, are matters of personal taste so you'll have to decide for yourself whether what I'm describing sounds like something that would bother you or not. I'm not much of a fan of poetry. At times I did enjoy the rhyming dialogue but other times it seemed like the writers were doing verbal backflips to fit the rhyme in, which made it feel forced and/or obscured the meaning. I do appreciate the novelty of it and how it lends itself to the storybookesque design. Some may dismiss the game as a kid's game due to the childish visuals or playing as a young girl but I urge you not to make that mistake.Without spoiling anything, I will simply say that the ending felt like it came rather abruptly but was otherwise satisfying. There was a point roughly 2/3rds of the way through my first playthrough that the combat became boring for a time. I was afraid going into my 2nd playthrough (New Game+) that I would be bored with the combat during most of it but that turned out not to be true. The level of challenge on Hard kept me on my toes and making use of all my party member's specialties. I must say that potions are fairly useless in the game. I only used about a dozen in total. Also, don't expect any complex puzzles or platforming. You can fly from nearly the start of the game so traditional platforming goes out the window in favor of mostly manipulating things with your firefly sidekick. Controlling both Aurora with WASD and Igniculus (firefly) with the mouse keeps things interesting. If I haven't mentioned any aspect you're wondering about go ahead and assume it's good, this game simply oozes quality.			"

												Child of Light is a beautiful children's story book brought to life with an exquisite hand-painted world. You play as a child princess, exploring and fight your way to the truth in a dream which turns proves to be more than a figment of imagination. You move around in the game by literally flying across the world from very early in the game. There is not much of gameplay outside combat other than avoiding traps and trying to hit the enemies from behind to trigger a ‘sneak attack’. Most of the enemies are optional but you’d want to fight them as frequently as possible to gain valuable experience which will come in real handy during the game’s much tougher boss fights. The combat is Turned-interruption-based. There is a timeline bar on the bottom of the screen and every action takes a fixed amount of time to perform. The bar is towards the right is split into ‘casting region’, which is the envelopes the time it takes for player as well as the enemies to perform their move. The idea here is to hit your enemies while they are casting so you ‘interrupted’ them.  Meaning they not only be able to perform their action, but they are also sent back a few notches behind the timeline, opening the window of opportunity for you to attack. I was not very familiar with this type of combat mechanics as a result I died quite a few times during boss fights. I asked around and to many people they found the game very easy on the ‘advanced or normal’ difficulty I played on. I had to grind to level up in order to defeat the final boss, so again I suggest to engage in all encounters. There is no drawback to losing to an encounter, you simply start with a full health and mana at the beginning of the section or whenever there was a checkpoint.  So the difficulty really depends on how familiar you are with this type of game.There are certain things I didn’t like about the game though. I feel the combat system doesn’t relay a lot of the vital information to the player. For example, you do not know the health of the enemies nor do you know which type of elemental stuff you have your team equipped. This means you are forced to memorize how you distributed your equipment and cannot make a well-timed final blows with no stats to look after. This especially hurts in the boss fights where the margin of error is very thin. Also the crafting is also not very well explained. You basically equip elemental attacks and defenses by equipping specific colored gems. You can also combine gems to create a different colored one. The game does not really explain which colors are possible to craft. So it is possible for a lot of players to go through half the game without knowing a certain gem color exists. I suggest you look into a guide just to make sure you get caught up with all the colors so you can equip your team with more organized attacks and defenses. I am not a fan of Ubisoft as a whole, but this is a side of Ubisoft I really admire. In the end I feel the game could have been a more rounded experience if they had more time and budget. A lot of effort had gone into making this game visually spectacular, unfortunately it meant the core mechanics of the game suffered and stretched a bit too thin for my taste. In the end these drawbacks can be frustrating, but does not detract much from the beautiful experience this game delivers.7/10 = Good! "

												The artwork and soundtrack are enchantingly beautiful - mix in some old school turn based RPG strats with a flying platformer and it's a solid game. I had to keep playing until I beat it, which is rare for me.			"

												If Child of Light taught me anything, it's that a flute can solve even the biggest problems. Like death, or having your whole race being turned into crows.All Joking aside, this is a great JRPG. I'm just starting chapter 10 and I feel it was already well worth the $15 I spent on it. If you love turned based combat, great art, and even better music. This is a amazing game just to sit back and realize with.			"

												This game is a really loveable 2D-flying-around RPG with Final Fantasy-style combat. It combines classical 'explore the level for treasure chests' with the RPG-known elements such as leveling of your party as well as timeline-based menu-combat. There are some minor additional features such as empowering your equipment with gems.What I really like about this game is the way it is created visually and atmosphere-wise. Its partly hand-drawn backgrounds are beautiful for anyone who appreciates this kind of 'fairytale' style. The conversations are all in rhymes. The game emphasizes that it is a mystical tale about a girl searching for a way home to her sick father. The music fits perfectly, too.Yes, sometimes i found some drawings a bit too childish, but the whole concept was great.You might notice that I am a strong fan of this kind of games. Nevertheless, be warned: If you are looking for pure-adult-action games, or dont have the muse or time to dive into the atmosphere of the game, it is nothing for you.I think it somewhat speaks to the inner child in everyone, and it got me hooked up there :)I strongly recommend giving it a try. I found it worth every cent.			"

												Child of Light is a fairytale-inspired RPG with modest exploration and puzzle-solving elements.The story is set in the magical world of Lemuria, which is suffering under the rule of an evil Black Queen and her dark creatures which have overrun the land. The main protagonist is a young girl, Aurora. Aurora is the daughter of a duke from 1895 Austria who has found herself separated from her father and whisked away to Lemuria. Aurora must navigate the hazards of this beautiful, but dangerous world in order to return to Austria and reunite with her father.Without spoiling the story, what I enjoyed the most about Child of Light's plot was that it managed to touch upon critical tropes integral to a fairytale story, while subverting ones which are no longer relevant in modern society. Aurora's adventure is a coming-of-age hero's journey, involving hidden destinies and familial strife. Despite her fear and uncertainty at being in an unfamiliar world, Aurora is no helpless damsel in distress; Aurora is a girl of strong morals and action who helps those in need, and who over the course of the story matures into a strong leader.The art style evokes nostalgia for watercolored storybooks of childhoods past. Both the character sprites and the backgrounds are simple at first look, and extremely detailed upon closer inspection. The visuals themselves are beautiful and alone make this game a piece of art.The soundtrack by Coeur de Pirate is a perfect accompaniment to the setting and story --  appropriately whimsical, triumphant, or haunting, as appropriate to the point in the story.One element of the game that some may be put off by (though personally I enjoyed it) was the use of rhyming iambic verse in nearly all of the dialogue in the story.All in all, I feel that Child of Light is a truly excellent adventure and well worth the full price of the game and deserving of the 2014 GOTY nomination it received from IGN.

												This game carries its own little charm. Artistically, it calls back to the watercolour art of fairy tale books. Looking at it is incredibly nostalgic, since I used to read books like this as a child. Even the narrative is reminiscent of the best of fairy tale tropes, though the game manages to sneak in its own details and wit that keep the story feeling fresh and light. Even the characters are unique, with our heroine Aurora experiencing a coming of age story but still retaining a spunky attitude.The best thing this game has to offer is the absolutely fantastic musical score that helps to create the atmosphere of Lemuria. The songs are emotional, they can be light, and they can be dark, all accentuating points throughout the game. And nothing is as good as the amazing boss battle music, with a male choir singing as you slice your way through hordes of monsters.The turn based system was really interesting to see, and I really enjoyed how they implemented it into the game. The twist with the turn based mechanic is a sort of ""wait"" or ""charge up"" time, and it adds another layer of strategy in that you want to stagger your opponent and prevent them from doing the same to you.A slight downside is that, at least for me, I had a challenging time with bosses while playing casually (though it could just be the fact that I don't play many turn based games often and so suck). Also, while Aurora and several other characters are 3D models, her allies are not, which can be a little jarring but not enough to inconvenience the game. I do think they should have developed models that looked at least a little bit different or accurate to their drawn portraits.Overall, Child of Light is a lovely game, and something you should check out when you can.

												Fantastic art, good story (though generic by itself), great soundtrack... and rhyming dialogues ! Ubisoft Montréal did a great job on Child of Ligh.This 10+ hours piece of art is a really good platformer / active time bar RPG hybrid.The only negative aspect I could reproach would be the autosave system which is a bit messy. It usually sends you back to a sort of checkpoint when you load the game, but at times it puts you to a place far away, or even right into a dialogue.I completely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good game, especially as it is not too long and can really be enjoyed.

												Final Impressions (01/11/2015; 15.5 hours playtime; Story Complete)If and when some unfortunate woman bears my child, I will do everything within my power to have that kid play this game. What a delightful synthesis of fairy tales, story-telling, and JRPG mechanics. This truly is a great coming-of-age story that was unfortunately ignored due to Ubisoft's many misteps in 2014. But I have the excellent meltotheany to thank for bringing it to my attention as I originally stated.The art direction in the game is fantastic. It really does look and feel like a children's fairy tale is playing out on screen. Moreover, the landscapes are varied and colorful, ranging from caves, forests, fires, castles, villages, etc. I found the rhyming dialogue charming. In addition, the dialogue really serves to bolster the characters' different personalities and backgrounds, whether they be brave warriors or merchants with a savvy eye on profit. Background characters aren't fleshed out as much in dialogue, often repeating the same two-line rhyming couplet. But this is forgiveable as they are background characters. A select few that give quests offers up for extensive dialogue that relates their personality so it's clear that it could've been done. But I will give Ubisoft the benefit of the doubt in that that didn't want to overencumber the game with too much irrelevant dialogue for the sake of word-building. There's just enough in there to give a generalized sense of the tribes and their cultues.As far as battle mechanics go, this was pretty interesting to me. I've played a handful of JRPGs in my time and this echoes the turn-based model. However, it brings an interesting twist. The player can interrupt enemy attacks by timing their attacks to occur in a limited time window, and vice versa. This really put me on the defensive more than I otherwise would, often trying to decide whether I should gamble on getting an attack in before my characters are hit or whether I should buckle down and defend to mitigate damage. In addition, the use of Igniculus (a firefly companion that the player can control with the mouse) helps in the tide of battle by slowing enemies down, healing your character, or activating one of two or three troves of health and mana. Equipment management is largely tossed aside (which I think is actually a pretty good idea) with the exception of oculi. Oculi are gemstones you collect and craft throughout the game which can be placed in one of three slots for various combat perks. The crafting system is simple and easy to understand with the use of a small chart that is provided and the player is left to their own imagination as far as experimenting with different combinations.The story of the game is also superb. On the one hand, it is somewhat traditional. On the other, being a sort of video fairy tale this is perfectly fine and there are a couple of twists to be enjoyed through the narrative. Ultimately, the game is a coming of age story as we watch Aurora deal with the new problems she has been presented with. Both the music and the narration butterfly perfectly with the narrative. This is especially true of the narrator, which chokes me up a little bit and brings me back to thoughts of listening to my mother tell me stories or read me books.From what I've read and experienced, many of the chracters are optional and are not required. The genius part is that this drastically affects gameplay, making the lone wolf much enjoy a much more difficult experience and a slightly stripped down story.All in all, this is an excellent, charming game with a sweet soul. It seems to me that a lot of love and attention went into its development and it really reflects in the experience. I encourage anyone to purchase it and give it a go. And THEN, after you beat it, do a little research on things mentioned in the game as there is a grain of truth at the heart of the story.First Impressions (01/08/2015; 7 hours playtime)Child of Light answers the question of, ""What would've happened if fairy tales and video games were invented at the same time and co-evolved?"" The music is beautiful. The art direction is fantastic. As it stands right now, this game is a diamond in the rough that hasn't received the attention it probably deserves. Hell, I wouldn't even have known about it if it weren't for my friend Melanie.Only two minor complaints so far. First, you have to use Uplay. That's not such a bad thing. My other complaint, however, broke my immersion for a brief moment. Early on, I was getting a few chuckles out of a particular character's dialogue. Shortly after an achievement popped up that said ""Comedy."" Normally I don't notice these if I'm not looking specifically for them on Steam. However, Uplay's design pops them in a big black box in the upper right and it's hard not to notice. I have hopefully turned these notifications off for the future but I recommend doing this before you begin your first play session.Anyway, more elaborate review forthcoming upon my completion of the game.

												Child Of Light is a beautiful piece of art. It is an amazing combination of beautiful visual, music, gameplay, and fairytale style story. Playing this game is like playing an interactive fairytale story that's been told by our parents before our sleep. But instead stay in the bed just hearing them. We jumped in right into the world and feel the emotion in the first handYou are Aurora, a little girld who's a daughter of a duke in austria at late 19th century. In one day you fall sick and died. But instead of go to afterlife you woke up in the world of Lemuria. You find out to go back to your father you need to help Lemuria regain it's sun, moon, and stars that been stolen by the Queen of Night. This is the quest of a pure hearted Child Of Light to help Lemuria and come back to her father.The world of Lemuria is so beautiful, really well made and you can feel ubisoft were put their best effort to realizing this world. It's an eyecandy for me, at first I was caught in awesomeness with the artstyle in this game. And later on I found this world has many place to explore. Hidden crates, hidden places with some puzzle solving that aren't so hard nor too easy to solve really make every exploration is worthwhile in this game. The music? SO AWESOME. Coeur De Pirate has really done amazing job to living up the world of Lemuria. Her piano playing suites well with the atmosphere of the game. And the boss battle music can pump your adrenaline, make you talked to yourself, ""Oh god oh god, this is must be the boss battle, this is gonna be awesome!!""It's really amazing to see the development of Aurora. She's pure hearted, unadorned like how a little girl should be, really honest to other people and especially to herself. But at the same time she also very brave and don't hesitate to take a drastic measue (Read: Violent measure). At first she's so scared for being far away with her father in such strange and dark place. But later on with help from her friends, she began developing her own bravery. My favourite line in this game is when Aurora facing a giant that get in her way.Aurora, ""Step away, or I will turn you into clay.""She, and all the characters in game were not voiced, only a dialogue balloon like how the comic does. But because of that, I imagine my own version of her voice. I imagine a little girl voice but full with confidence, has no doubt nor fear. It made me chilled my spine because of the excitement.The language that been used in this game is quite a mixed bag. They used somekind of language style that been used by old literature. At one side it can enhance the feel of a folklore, it feels like you just found an exciting old books, covered by dust in the box that been keeped by your grandfather. But in other side, sometimes it feels like it was forced. Like you want to told them, ""Just speak normally.""The gameplay involve 2D platforming adventure when engaging the enemiesis turn based with action timed battle. Once you engaged by an enemy you will moved into a battlescreen like how the old JRPG has done. The battle is so engaging, the boss can be quite challenging in the hard difficulty but failure is not very punishing. Every party member has their own speciality. As example Aurora is the physical damage dealer and the only one who can inflict Light Element magic. There are only 2 party active member at one time. I said active because basically every member can be involved in a battle. And you can always switch the party member at any turn. Switching party member depend on the situation is critical. Fortunately you are not have to keep Aurora in the active party at all time. The main character can be putted on the bench so other party member can take her place.Character skills customization are quite typical. In each level up you gain one skill point to spend. The skill tree in each character has 3 branch and that 3 branches is the only option of skill customization. In the late game one character can max one to two main branches. The equpment customization is more unique than the skills. Each characters can use occuli to increase modify their attribute. There are many combination in this game that maybe can make you sit in the occuli system for hours just to make sure every party members has the most effective occuli combination.But unfortunately, there are very annoying bug that ruin the beauty of this game. In this game, only Aurora and several other human character that been modelled by 3D. Other characters simply use 2D sprite. But when Aurora meets a characters that been modeled by 3D, the model overlap with each other. As example, in Aurora place, there were Norah, other character that modeled by 3D, stacked in her place. And in Norah's place, there was an Aurora stacked at her place. It always been like that and not a single time when Aurora meets other character with 3D model this bug didn't appear.My verdict is 9 out of 10. It is a very beautiful interactive folklore that make you wonder why there are no books of it so we can tell the children about Aurora Story before they asleep? With full of moral lesson that not too being smart♥♥♥♥♥or too being rightful one. This game is amazing for every ages. Oh have I said this game is very cheap? Only $15 dollar for about 17++ hour of excitement is totally worth it.			"

Amazing animations and a really well thought out game, WITH ONE PROBLEM!Cons: SAVE FAILED!This is a known issue that is apparently due to UPlay (another overlay launcher like Steam).  Numerous people have complained and while there are several fixes, none of them have worked for me.  This game uses an autosave feature and you CANNOT save the game yourself.  With this broken, it would be like playing a Final Fantasy game and starting over every time you quit the game.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  Ubisoft has made no attempts to fix this problem either, leaving lots of people (myself included) extremely frustrated.UPDATE: Ubisoft tech support was finally able to fix thsi for me by having me download a different ubosft installer.  Still, I'm not changing this rating, as this is something they should fix across the board with a pushed update.			"

												Child of Light is a bit of a rarety on steam, for several reasons. 1st, it needs you to install some third party pseudo platform from ubisoft. If that's a sticking point for you then don't read any more, because the rest of the review is quite positive.2nd, its kinda in the realm of a visual novel, but without any of the drag along standards that keep visual novels geared towards older teens. If you want a story driven game that you could relax while letting your kid brother play at your grandma's house, here you have one.3rd, this is a short and easy game. Not that this is bad, just different. None of that ""Hours into a dungeon and still no save point."" The whole game took me just over 12 hours on casual setting. There is something to be said for an easy dungeon that is just long enough to chew that last piece of rhyming dialogue, before the next one.Graphics are top notch, though it is getting rare to see a new game that graphics aren't awesome in. Still worth mentioning, because its not about detailed realistic graphics that a hudred people coded together in a secret room any more. Instead what makes graphics shine is grabbing onto an artistic vision and being true to it throughout the game, which Child of Light definitely does gorgeously.The music is okay, at least what there is of it. It felt a couple of times like they ran out of funding for their orchestra only 30% through the recordings. Some silence here and there, and a couple of somewhat obvious loops.Personally, I very much enjoyed this game. I really hope to encounter not a sequel, but a series of games based on this style.Here are the subjective numbers:10/10 graphics4/10 music and sound9/10 story0/10 first person shooter experience8/10 game experience10/10 storybook experience			"

												The soundtrack, storyline, and artwork to this game is superb and mesmerizing.  It's not happy by any means, it's extremely melancholic.  I admit welling up quite a bit during the storyline: even the beginning (shut up, I'm sensitive).  The gameplay is rather simple too, nothing overly complex yet still has enough appeal/challenge to make you want to keep playing.  This game needs more acclaim, actually.  And Aurora, (admittedly I'm bit biased too because I have red hair) is <3			"

												Child of Light is a somewhat short but still fun take on the RPG genre.  I played the game on the casual difficulty, there is also an option for hardcore difficulty but I'm not sure what that changes that makes to the gameplay.You start off as a girl named Aurora who begins a journey in another land.  At the start of the game you are only limited to walking along the ground however you will soon be granted the gift of flight and the game takes off from there.  After learning to fly you'll begin exploring the world of Lemuria and gaining companions to explore the world with you and fight the evil your tasked to fight.  The combat in the game is active turn based combat with the ability to have your turn or the enemies turn interupted.  There is the waiting phase and the casting phase.  If you attack an enemy in the casting phase they will lose their attack, while if the enemy attacks you in that phase you lose your turn.  There are skills both passive and active (friendly or enemy) that can speed up or slow down your waiting/casting bar.  There are not to many complicated enemies in the game.  Most enemies are pretty easy to decipher what they are weak to (Water/Fire/Lightning/Light) and you are able to slot some gems into your weapons/armour to plan for them.  As well some characters have type specific damge.And moving into Characters.  The game features a wide array of various side kicks to help Aurora in her quest.  The side characters have a unique look and feel to them.  Your elemental light companion will be your main companion through the whole game and does add some uniqueness to the game.  He has the ability to find hidden areas as well as aid in battle or heal Aurora outside of battle.  However when the battles begin is where the most of the characters begin to feel kind of generic.  Most of the characters have very similar abilities outside of a select few.  For the most part they have a single target attack, multi target attack and then a spell of some sort.  For my play through I only used 3 or 4 of I think the 8 avaiilable side characters.  You also gain levels fairly frequently which lets you keep adding to the skill tree.  The skill tree seems large at first, however the amount of levels gained, the tree fills quickly.  But progressing through the skill tree doesn't provide as big a reward as it should, most of it is just increasing damage for certain abilities.The enemies do also fall into the generic sorts in battle.  There isn't the biggest diversity of enemy types and then some are reused for the different element types (Fire/Water/Lightning), but there's enough types you won't see the same ones over and over gain the whole game.The story is good, nothing ground breaking or exremely memorable.  But it does have it's moments that keep you interested in it.The art is probably the biggest thing that I enjoyed about the game.  The game has a very unique/interesting art style and while not everyone may like it, I felt it suits the game's story and overall feel of the game.  There are variety of unique locations in the game and the art does make them feel unique and makes the game enjoyable to explore. The levels/areas in the game are fairly straight forward.  There are some puzzles and hidden areas to find, but for the most part each area is pretty simple and straight forward to go through.  There is a little bit of backtracking throughout the game but not enough that it gets frustratiing.The game is a uPlay activated game and for some that's a big issue.  I've never really had any big issues with uPlay that haven't got resolved quickly.  The game does go on sale fairly frequently and I would suggest picking it up on sale as it is fairly short and not overly difficult.  Also the DLC is not realy required however I did enjoy the Golem so I feel that might be worth picking up with the game.  Overall if you are looking for a not to difficult active turn based RPG with unique visuals than this game should meet all those requirements.  If you are looking for a lengthy adventure, or a more challenging task, than this is something you may want to pass over.  I enjoyed the game for what it was and it was enjoyable to play through.

												I'm surprised. This game can easily be in the best 5 from Ubisoft. The story has it's up and downs but overall it is good. The game itself is not too long and there is not much content. That few sidequest which comes in the face is not too much considering the size of the word and can be completed in a few hour at most. But I appreciate the New Game+, its not like it makes it really hard but to spend a few more hours with this game is enough. Thank you Ubisoft.			"

												An RPG with a beautiful watercolour artstyle and a lovely soundtrack to boot. The difference between this game and other turn-based RPGs is that each character's move is set on a timeline, with the player having the ability to slow the speed of each enemy's move, creating a more tactical approach to fighting than just waiting for your next turn to occur. The story is really well set out as well, with a great cast of characters and conversations in the style of poems. The only downside to the game is that you need to run UPlay in order to play it, but if you can overlook that then you'll find a great hidden gem from the past year's games.			"

												There are games which send you on journeys. Unforgetable adventures. Memorable characters. Lovely experiences. This is one those rare few. Days have come where AAA games are under critisism for lack of quality and moneys worth. And now the indie-type games have come to rule the industry. This is evident from many of these games which stand out exceptioanlly.The game play is pretty unique. But the fightng mechanism could be fresutrating. So in case of enjoying the story, start off with a lower difficulty. [This advise is so out in my prespective as I always play the games in highest difficulty.] As fights doesn't play much of a part in the story, don't let it disturb your progress.I would recommend all of you to play this masterful game. This would help you to mend the black mark which you have in mind about Ubisoft!			"

This game was something I didn't expect, since I went in only seeing a small preview and going off someone's reccommendation. I got lost in this game, which is something hard to do. I really, really can't stress enough how beautiful the artwork is and how much it adds to the actual story. Simply put, Child of Light is fantastic.			"

												There are times when you encounter good games. There are times when you encounter great games.And then you encounter Child of Light.This is not only a game but a masterpiece, a love poem, a gift for your senses. In this game you take the role of Aurora, a princess who passed away due to a physical ailment she contracted and wakes up to find herself in the lands of Lemuria. She seeks to reunite with her father and save her kingdom from the claws of the Black Queen.This might sound very cliché and all, you might already have an idea of how the story develops and you might even be right, but what makes this game valuable is not the story it tells but rather how it tells it.Every conversation will be in rhyme (ABCB style) unraveling Aurora and her companion's story. The gameplay is smooth, natural and so intuitive you can stop playing the game for a year and get back to it in a matter of minutes. The art is incredibly beautiful, the animation combines both 3D and 2D elements, making it top eyecandy material. The soundtrack is mystical, takes you to an amazing journey through the lands of Lemuria, makes you dream, feel the game, taking the Child of Light experience to its fullest. The characters are very unique, every one of them will be an irreplaceable link in your party, and their story will make them not only pawns in your war, but friends.And Aurora F**KING FLIES around the screen, making the scenaries totally enjoyable in every perspective. This is a feature I'd love to see in more games.For once I can say I've fallen in love with a Ubisoft game.			"

												Child of Light is one of the most beautiful games in the world.There's no doubt that the game is mostly story driven, but it's also wonderful in every other aspect. Sure, there's a horrible third-party DRM involved (Uplay), but that shouldn't stop you from buying this game. Anyone who skipped buying it for that reason, or for any reason at all, is missing out.Boasting exquisite art that amazes the eyes down to the finest detail, playing Child of Light is akin to walking through a picture book. From Aurora's intricate character model to the resplendent backdrops present throughout the world of Lemuria, the game never ceases to impress with its visual glory. Moreover, the ability to fly is granted to the player very early on, allowing you to explore Lemuria as you wish.Battle in Child of Light is largely similar to typical turn based systems in other games, though there are still some twists that make it unique and perhaps, slightly difficult. Good timing of moves in particular is extremely important to triumph over the various monsters that you will encounter during your journey.Multiplayer isn't a totally fleshed out feature of the game, but it's possible. During battle, a second player may assist you by controlling Aurora's companion, Igniculus, to slow or stun single targets. This allows you to focus on planning and executing your moves rather than having to bother with micromanagement simultaneously. It's perfectly possible to handle both tasks on your own if playing by yourself, however.Child of Light's soundtrack was composed by Cœur de pirate (Béatrice Martin), a tremendously talented singer/songwriter. I've personally purchased the soundtrack (which is available on her website) for the sole reason that it was a pleasure to listen to.Naturally, this game's winning asset is its impeccable story - one that's heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time, albeit easy to follow and understand. Saying any more would simply ruin the serenity of its plot, so I'll leave it to you to find out for yourself!			"

												This pretty, sweet and rather short fairy tale has nothing really great or novel about it. The story is your typical ""little magical girl and her friends against the forses of darkness"". The gameplay consists of a mildly explorable action-adventure overworld and an active time turn-based battle system. Watercolors-on-paper graphics create a feeling of a kid's book come alive. Nothing about it is groundbreaking, but everything is exceptionally well-crafted and fits together so well that it becomes hard to put down. A cozy and heartwarming experience among the world of bloody power fantasies.			"

Pleasently suprised by Child of Light!I had this game in my library ever since its release but never got around to give it a shot.The art direction is really superb. Great visual style with an outstanding soundtrack (piano by Béatrice Martin, aka Coeur de Pirate). My only wish would have been if the soundtrack been possible to buy as DLC since it is not. (if interested, you can acquire it on either iTunes or here:   Website link[musique.coeurdepirate.com])The combat gameplay is all turn-based so it is not ""so simple"" as it may seems. As for non-combats, you have some quests to do, which can unlock some more companions that follows you in your adventure. All companions offer a different set of skills and abilities for the turn-based combat. Enemies all have weakness to some type of attack/damage type whether magical or melee. Experimenting with different combos is another strong suite of this game!Story is pretty much your ""already seen, already played out"" but I'm still fine with it.Overall, this is a game that I wholeheartedly recommend for either adults and even for kids... or ever better, parents playing this with their kid!

												Look, i'm not the type of person who usually plays these kind of games. I tend to stick with larger Tripple A titles from larger companies, and may sometimes jump into smaller, 2D, indie or story based games, but this game just blew me away.The mixture of a great story with a fantastic soundtrack, and beautiful art design (so good). I remember exploring this world and seeing the amazing mountains and buildings in the background, and once even noticed a giant walking in the distance. The beauty of the game really blew me away, and the beautiful soundtrack made it better. It was so beautiful and fun exploring this world, and it left me wanting more when I finished. The combat was intense, interesting and really fun as well. I was really satisfied everytime I won a battle. The boss battles were really the highlight of the combat in my opinion. I had more fun fighting the bosses than the actual creatures you come across while exploring, and this is obviously how it should be.The only negative thing I came across was that the menu was so obviouly made for consoles. It was awkward navigating at times and I often made mistakes, but it's something that I got used to and didn't mind too much, it's only a slight issue.Overall it's a great game that you should buy. 9/10 for those who care about scores...

												Ultimately, it's an incredible game.  It's undoubtedly gorgeous, and every bit of dialogue and music just adds to the rich experience of playing the game.  Uplay, however,  is terrible.  If you've already suffered through creating a Uplay account for some other game, then I would highly recommend this one.  If you haven't, I would simply recommend that you avoid it as best you can.  Summary: Game = GoodUplay = Bad			"

												I liked Child of Light a whole lot, especially because it's made through independent means. Loved the painterly art style of the game, but not a whole lot of replay value. Bought it because it was on sale, and the experience is definitely worth the price. Before you play it, though, make sure your computer can handle the graphics, because my old one sure lagged while playing it.			"

												While many would call this a children's title based off its presentation and appearance, it has a bit of depth in terms of a complex and somewhat fun combat system.  Its difficulty can be a bit underwhelming at times, but battles place a heavy reliance on planning, buffs, timing, interrupting enemy attacks whilst preventing your own from being disrupted and your usual RPG elements.  Namely, elemental weaknesses or some enemies being heavily resistant to physical attacks, but crumble under magic.  Or those that stage counterattacks to physical attacks, etc.  That part feels very Final Fantasy.Unfortunately, the depth and sense of achievement that would come from this Active Time Battle inspired element disappears when the game's relatively low difficulty comes into effect.  You are never in such danger, even by the midgame, that a health potion or a debuff spell doesn't completely turn the tides in your favor.  To that end, I do feel the game was intended for a younger audience.Nitpicking aside, it holds very true to being a digital fairytale - if a somewhat dry one.  The story is not particularly engaging, so most of what will carry you along is the combat system and the overall charm the world itself presents.  There are mountains walking about with cities on their backs, visible in some area backgrounds far in the distance and that you scale from the ground up that gives some good flavor to the world overall.  But the slow pace of the story makes the beautiful watercolor backdrops something you'd probably be more satisfied taking in bites rather than trying to playing the whole game through in one sitting.Overall, it's a decent attempt.  It could do with a few more engaging or deep elements, but it is what it is - an indie-game-lookalike with a decent combat system and some charming decor.			"

												I'm deeply ambivalent about Child of Light.  Its target demographic seems to be tween girls, which doesn't quite describe me, but I did find it engaging enough to spend the 18-ish hours of a complete play-through with all the side quests -- well, nearly all; about which more later.  Despite that, though, I finished with the sense that it's simply not that good overall.  I'm glad I only paid $15 for it.On the one hand, much of the game is frankly gorgeous.  The watercolor world,, layered and constantly in motion behind the primary action, is brilliantly done.  So is the character animation while roaming that world: Aurora's hair billowing around her is nearly a character in its own right, and adorable.  There's a great deal to be said for a game that is purely wonderful just to look at.On the other hand... it's not a particularly good game.  The most that can be said for it is that the difficulty ramp is tuned fairly well, with the significant foes in the final stages of the game being approximately as challenging as the corresponding ones in the early stages.  Beyond that, well... there's a great deal of repetition, of ""oh, these are just like those only they're ice now instead of fire"" cookie-cutter critters, and not much actual variety throughout.  The combat mechanic looks highly varied on paper, but in practice I found myself using essentially identical tactics against every foe, and all those options were pointless.  The thin veneer of ""puzzles"" in world-navigation in the end amounted only to ""find the heavy thing nearby and drag it onto the pressure plate,"" repeated several times.And oh my stars, the writing.  The writing is bad.  Quite bad, really; and bad in multiple ways.A lot's been said about the game's couching all of its text in rhyme, and yes; it's all true.  The writing is clunky, forced, sophomoric -- so bad that I wonder whether it's a translation from another language.  The game is from Ubisoft Montreal, after all; perhaps it was written in French and then translated?  If so, I hope the French is considerably better.  In English, it's not only bad but illiterate.  The game consistently writes ""fair"" when the right word is ""fare,"" for example.  That's one that a competent editor would have spotted a mile away.Beyond the quality of the poetry (or lack thereof) there's the story.  The story, too, is bad.  It's thin.  Insipid.  Narratively it's incredibly weak -- nothing you actually do has any relevance to the story; the mechanics of the game turn out to be unrelated time-filler in between cutscenes that actually tell the story.  The cutscenes themselves, all strung together, add up to very little storytelling time, and that's proof right there that there's just not much story here to be told in the first place.  There are other fundamental design and production flaws as well.  The mechanical powerup system is left coyly to the player's ""experimentation"" -- a ridiculous conceit given the availability of Google.  One of the significant side-quests was also, as far as I could tell, buggy and therefore unavailable in my play-through.  I consulted a number of walkthroughs, and they would say things like ""go to this location and then pass through the village to the right until you reach the girl with the ! over her head.  Talk to her and she will tell you about the side quest"" ... but there was no such character in that location or village.  Oops.I said above that the game is gorgeous, and it is -- the bulk of the time.  The world-traversal artwork, where you spend the bulk of the game (and in more static fashion where combat takes place) is terrific.  The animation of the Aurora model is similarly delightful, as I mentioned above.  Other characters' animation is disappointingly weak by comparison, though; combat winds up looking more cartoony and less engaging as a result.  Worst of all are the conversation interludes: they're ugly.  The detailed, multilayered watercolor world is set aside and instead we get zoomed-in three-quarter profiles of the characters, rendered in a rough, almost crayon style.  It's hugely jarring, especially since the poor artwork is invariably accompanied by worse (rhymed) dialog.... and yet, on balance, I'm recommending the game!  A lot of that is because it is inexpensive -- if it were a $40 first-tier title, I would absolutely tell you to save your money.  But $15 for twelve to twenty hours of entertainment is not that bad, especially if you compare it to things like movie theater rates (2 hours for $10!).  And it was entertaining -- despite gritting my teeth every time I had to get through a conversation scene's appalling rhyme and sub-par artwork, I was hooked, wanting to see the game through to the end.  I don't think I can honestly recommend against a game that I cared that much about despite significant flaws.			"

												This side scrolling RPG game is full of gorgeous art, tells a heartfelt story and has classic turnbased gameplay. It just has a little problem with details.POSITIVES -And honestly if that's what you want in a game, Child of Light is completely for you. Its gameplay is very simple, a little repetitive and not complicated, like the usual RPG. It'll throw in stat boosts, debuffs and a rock paper scissors formula as the game goes on, but nothing that's too difficult or new. So if you're fine with that old school feel, you'll be impressed with the game.The art is painted, water colored and ... well, amazing. The music ranges from soft and to intense; the developer really knew what she was doing. The atmosphere is also done so well, from the dark and moody beginning, to the huge and open bright fields after you've gained your new powers.And really the feel of this game is what helps the story. You play as a young girl named Aurora who's been thrown down the rabbit hole, everything straight out of an old child book. And it really works. This coming-of-age tale is detailed and imaginative, but still very simple. It's a tale of good vs. evil, growing up and even tragedy. Running through a lonely and dark forest in the beginning of the game, only to shout a cheer when you gain your wings and sword, it just feels triumphant. Our main protagonist goes from being a slightly selfish princess and child, to someone who takes on responsibility, even if it means making tough decisions and charging into a dark world that isn't so different from our own.NEGATIVES -The few problems of Child of Light are mainly its tedious puzzles, lack of development in its side cast and rushed ending.I had no problem with the old feel of gameplay or skill set, like some people do. But after hours of playing the game, even in its last dungeon, you'll be maneuvering around the same spikes, pushing boxes and following clues you've seen before. It would have been nice to have a little more variety.The side characters are extremely endearing filled with personality, even if a little cliché. But after their initial introduction, they barely get any extra personal touch and their problems don't get mentioned or resolved until the end of the game......which is rushed. And that's unfortunate, because it's VERY rushed. The game has a way of giving a good poetic feel when it comes to its plot. And certain things in this sort of fantasy setting aren't meant to make complete sense, but Child of Light still has it all structured. So it's pretty jarring when the game ends rather quickly, really quickly. It resolves everything, but it seems much more forced than everything you've been through so far. And certain plot twists and events don't get explained fully or at all at the end.CONCLUSION -Child of Light is really an amazing game and one of my favorites for 2014. It has everything put together so well and it’s just lovely. But the details are sometimes a little muddy.Those issues didn't distract me enough though to not HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to anyone.Wonderful. Bravo. I want a sequel.			"

												A unique RPG that blends a feel between Final Fantasy & a fairy tale. The main arc of the story is quite interesting and entraces your mind to delve deeper into the story. Surprised that this game is published by Ubisoft; but therein lies the problem.Pros:+ Beautiful and unique art style+ Gorgeous soundtrack+ Engaging and interactive battle system+ Most characters are likeableCons:- ""Uplay"" Ubisoft DRMOverall: DRM is annoying and just terribly inconvenient in ways more than one. Battle system plays out a little like ""South Park: Stick of Truth"" if you've played it. Other than that, I wholeheartedly recommend this game for all of its positive aspects, a fantastic game if you're an avid RPG fan. I sincerely hope they can release another game from this universe or another game like this.TL;DR 10/10 rhyming simulator 2014 is good.			"

												As a player of console-style RPGs, I'm really happy this game exists.  It's a beautiful example of how art direction can add so much to solid gameplay and a classic, if well-worn, story.  The game's combat system is really easy for any veteran of the genre (which is why they included a Hard mode), but works well and integrates well into the tactics you can do with your party.  It's solid, it's fun, and it strikes that balance where battles don't frustrate you into hating whenever they crop up, but they also interest you enough to put thought into the fight.It's really the art direction that sells this game, though.  Everything is a dreamy watercolor and ink, perfectly suited for a children's story book.  Coupled with the excellent music, I found myself completely involved in Aurora's adventure, wanting her to succeed and happy that I was there helping her out in a way.  I cringed at her bare feet on the rocky ground, chuckled at every time she had to sternly correct people that she wasn't a princess, smiled at her childish and loving dialogue, fought not to cry at her moment of despair, and sometimes even found myself staring in awe as she took on grim creatures for the sake of Lemuria and her friends.It's a fairy tale, so don't expect any plot twists, but it makes no bones about what it is, and as such people who come in expecting to be sucker-punched should probably stick with the games that do that kind of plot, like OFF or The Witch's House.  This isn't to say that the game lacks emotional torque; I've found it very difficult to get past teary-eyed even at the most intense moments in games I've played, and this thing had me fighting not to cry around the midway point.  I knew every last thing that would happen, and yet the telling was beautiful enough to make it seem fresh and new.  That's the core of it, really; it could have easily fallen apart with how cliched everything could be said to be, but it believes so deeply in its story that I ended up believing too, and that experience is what makes the difference.

												I'm not entirely sure what drew me to Child of Light.  Was it the beautiful watercolor art?  The plaintive music?  The little girl that reminded me of my own daughter?  All I can say is that the previews exhibited an intangible quality that made the game one that I had to purchase.First and foremost, Child of Light is a classic fairy tale, told simply and in a straightforward manner.  It is filled with the tropes one might expect - wicked stepmother, lost child, an impossible quest - and is also possessed of the melancholy that the best fairy tales have, a feeling intensified by the haunting flute melody.  This effect is also heightened by the beautiful art direction.  I felt like I was watching a painted book illustration come to life, and when I first started the game, I spent a minute or two just marvelling at the way Aurora's hair swirled as if underwater.Child of Light is also a role-playing game, and although some of its mechanics fall short, the main battle system is wonderfully and unexpectedly engaging.  The basic concept is simple: during combat a single time bar shows who is the next to act, whether it be a member of your party or a monster.  Chosen actions and haste attributes affect how long it takes to reach the end of the bar and perform your action.  And if you hit a monster (or vice versa) in the small space of time right before it acts, you interrupt the creature and send it flying back down the time bar.This one modification to a pretty standard combat system adds a layer of excitement and calculation.  Chain-interrupting a monster over and over again feels utterly dominating; trying to ensure that your party avoids interruption can be nerve-wrackingly tense.  And when you encounter later monsters and bosses that punish you for interrupting them, the sudden scramble to figure out an appropriate strategy is enjoyably frenetic.The supporting game systems - skill trees, potions, gem crafting - are less polished, almost like afterthoughts.  Rather than enhancing the play, they feel like something tacked on just to give the player additional things to do.  That leads to another potential criticism: Child of Light is not the most difficult game, and someone yearning for challenging depth may be disappointed.Add my feeling that the ending was a bit abrupt, and the conclusion is that Child of Light could have done with a few more coats of polish.  That being said, I still loved my time playing the game, the sensation of falling from the present into a magical and wondrous world.  For me, Child of Light is an easy game to recommend.--- Closing Eyes is Magic ---""Ready?"" he asks, and Melly nods.  He pinches a blue plastic brick between two fingers and lifts it up before his daughter.  ""And now,"" he says, ""I will make this disappear!""  Melly nods again, solemn as a statue.  She doesn't smile much, not anymore, but he is hopeful that this will do the trick.He holds the brick for a heartbeat longer.  Then he takes his other hand and swirls it.  ""Abracadabra,"" he says.  ""Hocus pocus. . .  Now close your eyes!""Melly does so immediately.  A faint tink falls somewhere in the room.  ""Look,"" he says.  ""It's gone!""It is gone.  Melly jumps up and down and claps her hands; pleased, he spreads his arms in triumph.  ""Again!"" she says.  ""Daddy, do it again, please!""He knows he shouldn't, but he no longer has the heart to refuse her much.  And so he does it again: he holds another brick out, he waves his hand, he incants the magic words.  Except this time when he shouts for her to close her eyes, she keeps them open.  Her gaze tracks the brick as he tosses it over his shoulder.He sighs.  ""Potato,"" he says, invoking his pet name for her, ""you didn't close your eyes.""""I wanted to see what you did.""  Melly says.  Her forehead creases, and for a moment he sees the ghost of her mother there.  ""You just threw it!  That's not magic.""He rolls his eyes, exaggerating for effect.  ""Well  of course not.  That's not where the magic is.""  He takes his index finger and places it on her forehead, firmly.  ""Closing eyes is magic.""Melly hesitates, then agrees.  And when he performs the trick a third time, she closes her eyes.  When she opens them, the brick is gone, he is grinning, and she laughs and laughs and laughs.***The next afternoon as they walk home from kindergarten, Melly trips over cracks, stumbles over rocks, bumps into mailboxes.  After the third time she falls, he examines her and frowns.  ""Potato,"" he says, ""are you walking with your eyes closed?""Melly smiles.  One hand grips her father's; the other is outstretched, palm up with fingers lightly curled, as if holding an invisible hand, or perhaps one that has been missing for the past half year.  ""Closing eyes is magic,"" she says, gently.  ""I remembered.""Startled, he opens his mouth.  He should say something, but he does not know what.  So instead he watches his daughter float along, a dream on her face.  A few steps later, he closes his own eyes.  And then he opens them again to cross the street.			"

												A type of game that we are not used to seeing developed by Ubisoft, ""Child of Light"" is a successful experiment of showcasing the JRPG genre with a really good story, and a fascinating art style once more to the Western audience.=STORY=A girl named Aurora wakes up in the world of Lemuria after falling asleep due to a physical ailment when stolen from her home. After meeting a unique firefly named Igniculus, she learns that Lemuria's celestial bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, have been stolen by the Dark Queen. While she is more concerned with re-uniting with her father, she is tasked with recovering the Sun, Moon, and Stars to save Lumeria before she does. Along the way, she will come across various opponents, and allies to assist her on the journey and in battle.=GAMEPLAY=Child of Light is primarily focused on the JRPG genre, with the battle sequence elements inspired by Final Fantasy and Grandia. You will have to wait until it is your turn to cast on the battle timeline to attack and ultimately defeat your opponents. However, if you get struck while on the ""Cast"" portion, you will be interrupted and will have to wait until you can cast once more. Each character has physical and magic attacks, although of course, some will specialize with one over the other. Aside from that, we have the open world type gameplay. Traveling to different towns and destinations are pretty straightforward, but no one said you can't explore. Each town you visit will have some sort of issue you must tackle before you can advance; it reminds me of Dust: An Elysian Tail pretty recently, but that game will be for another day. Towns will also have side quests if you are into doing it. Some of them do reward you with additional allies in the game, which is beneficial for the harder boss fights ahead. Something that I was really interested in but got bored of towards the end was the rhyming that they made in the game. It does sound like a nice concept to use when characters are talking to one another, but it seemed a little bit forced at times.=VISUALS/ART=Visually speaking, it is really awesome to look at when you're so into the game. According to the reveal at GDC Europe 2013 by Patrick Plourde, it is said that the art style is inspired by the films of Studio Ghibli and Yoshitaka Amano (known for his commissioned illustrations for Final Fantasy). The art is really pretty to look at, especially the way Aurora looks at one point in the game...my goodness...she's beautiful...I wish I knew how to elaborate on this subject more, but I'll leave that to those who can actually draw, unlike me.=MUSIC=Musically speaking, I find it interesting and really nice to listen to. However, my only complaint is the amount of repetition for the music pieces involved in regular fights and boss fights equally.=FINAL VERDICT=Giving the chance of bringing more publicity to the JRPG genre, packed with a beautiful looking art style, a great story, and nice soundtrack, with the expense of tryhard-ish rhymes, ""Child of Light"" is worth getting if you're big on other games like Final FantasyOn a scale of Meatloaf to Pizza, I give this game: A ""Spaghetti and Meatballs"" rating.

												Even though Child of Light is tagged as a platformer, the tactical battles play a much more significant role in the game. It's a unique and engaging system where success depends on selecting the right characters for the encounter, utilizing the skills in an intelligent way, and a unique system of timing the attacks. Beautiful visuals are accompanied by exellent music. Music I'd actually listen to outside of the game. I almost quit playing after tiring of forced rhymes, and a story I wasn't that invested in. Around the middle of the game, I started enjoying the story a bit more. There were times when the story touched an emotional chord. Combat could become a little repetitive, but a new challenge usually wasn't too far around the corner so I persevered during those times. The music in the final battle was like a reward for my persistence. Controlling the flow of combat with Igniculus was rewarding in its own right, just as much as selecting the right characters for a particular encounter and making smart skill choices.A new game+ mode exists for those looking for more, but I think it is a 1 playthrough type of game. A playthrough which I enjoyed more than I first thought I would. For a more detailed review please see my  full review.[www.oneguytoomanygames.com] "

												Curator Page: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/disastercake#curationOverall a very enjoyable romp through a colorful dream world where you can fly!I completed the game in about 10 hours.The battle system is heavily inspired by Grandia's active time combat with interuptions coupled with Final Fantasy 10's feature to swap team members in and out whenever you want.  In addition it has the twist that you can hover over a single enemy and click to ""slow"" them with light.Some notes:Pulls a lot of similar classic JRPG inspirations as my own game, Soul Saga.Plays and feels like a polished indie game, but was actually created by Ubisoft, a rather large AAA studio.An interesting european take on the JRPG genre.Beautiful water color styled 2D graphics.There are 2 difficulty modes: Easy and Hard.  I played on easy and, to be expected, it was quite easy.  I never tried hard.Healing is done in a unique way where you find glowing bushes that spawn a series of orbs you then move your cursor over in the correct order to spawn healing orbs.Classic European evil godmother and step sisters type fairytale story (with its own unique twists) that takes place in a surreal dream world.You can fly early on in the game, making exploration quite fun.Clever and interesting puzzles in the level design related to your light creating cursor and flying ability, though the puzzle variety is very limited.No equipment, instead you combine gems you find to determine stats.A few quick side quests (12 total), but mostly just a linear main storyline.All of the characters talk in rhyme.  Apparently they designed the game to be like an interactive fairy tale poem.Some weird uPlay login system, apparently a secondary DRM.No Steam achievements as of this review posting.  Apparently the uPlay thing keeps its own achievement records.Took about 10 hours for me to do a nearly 100% playthrough. (missed one side quest)There's some sort of new game plus, but I haven't looked into it as I felt satisfied with the amount I playedA small critique, but it feels like the ending is a little rushed compared to the pacing of the rest of the game.  By just my intuition it seems like there might have been one last dungeon planned but got cut out for the scope.  Perhaps related: apparently the art director passed away a year before the project launched.  At the end of the credits his name, Thomas Rollus, appears as dedicated to.  As a game developer myself I was curious to know more about how an interruption with such a critical role affected the project, but couldn't find anymore information.  If anyone knows, please feel free to share.			"

Beneath the cute, cherubic face of the main character, Aurora, lies a deep plot of betrayal, death, despair, witty dialogue, and complex emotional situations.  While the characters speak largely in prose, sometimes the rhyming seems a bit forced or tedious, but overall, this doesn't detract from the appeal of this game.  You may need a dictionary or thesaurus handy for some lines, as Ubi is definitely flexing their literary muscles with this title.UbiArt has found the perfect fusion between picturesque platforming adventure games and true, turn-based classic rpgs.  Using a battle system somewhat reminiscent of the battle systems in Final Fantasy 6 through 10 and a skill system something like out of 10 and 11, the player is given an experience that will probably be familiar, but with new aspects to it, such as the ability to choose an enemy to slow down.  The combat system is further diversified with the use of special crystals that the characters can equip in order to enhance various combat abilities.I just spent two days marathoning this game on hard and feeling very satisfied with what I had played.  While somewhat short in terms of rpgs at roughly 20 hours without DLC, there's no shortage of things to do in the game.  The tendency to skip battles will be high with the ability to simply fly around many of them, but you may not want to.  Boss battles tend to be pretty hard and need a good bit of planning to get through.  I'm honestly not sure if that holds true on lower difficulties.  One nice feature of the game is that if you've missed a side quest or mini-quest along the way, that's not a problem.I think the two best features of this game are the local co-op and the use of the light-based puzzles.  The second player takes control of Igniculus, a small light elemental that helps Aurora at the start of her adventure.  Using either the mouse or the second player controller (controllers work best in this game, imo), the second player can move around, gather items for the player, light up rooms, and slow down enemies.   This is a great feature for gamers with kids that actually want to take part in their parent's activities.  Even if they don't listen to you and go off and do their own thing, it won't be devastatingly bad, except maybe during a boss battle.The light puzzles caught me offguard at first, but once I got used to them, they were fairly easy, yet still interesting.  More games integrating puzzles into their gameplay could definitely learn from the examples in this game.  I nearly got thrown off by one puzzle at the Gate to the Palace of the Sun, but was able to figure it out with some careful observation.The soundtrack for this game is amazingly well done.  Songs are sufficiently long enough that being stuck on a stage doesn't become an experience of wanting to pull your ears off of your head, and the boss music is sufficiently epic for fighting demons, dragons, and things of that sort.  Perhaps even more fittingly epic than many other games that I've played.			"

												I have never played such a beautiful game such as Child of Light. I was shocked to see Ubisoft develop an arcade game like this but its story was emotional and actually has a moral to it.Though it only took me 9 hours to finish the main story, I highly recommend this game.Every single character and companion comes with a great back story and are very well developed. The world is beautiful, you can tell that from my screenshots. And this game adds a real-time feel to its turn based combat. Honestly, this game doesn’t cost much and is an open world game so it is truly worth your money. Give it a try			"

Ubisoft doesn't disappoint me for once.Pros:Art/atmosphere is astounding, you can really tell they put a lot of care into the look and feel of this game.Well polished 2D platform and RPG elements.Combat is engaging and fun. While the individual combat mechanics used in this game can be found in other RPGs, when viwed as a whole, it feels like a unique experience.Wonderful co-op experience to enjoy with a friend or significant other.Nine very different and interesting party members.Great soundtrack.Neutral:Requires the use of Uplay. This might be considered a flat-out con for some. While I view it as a slight annoyance, not a huge deal for me.Rhymes, Rhymes everywhere.Game is kind of short (I beat it in about 13 hours), however, it is also rather inexpensive. Cons:Game isn't fully voice-overed. "

												So here is the thing - if you like Uplay, or aren't annoyed by having to use another steam-like client in addition to steam every single time you want to play this game - consider my review a thumbs up and move on to the second portion of my review.The following reasons for hating Uplay are my reasons for giving this a thumbs down (this is ubisoft developed)1. Steam already exists.2. Uplay is chewing up more than 0% of my resources.3. There is no way to bypass Uplay to simply launch Child of Light.4. Uplay pop-ups. 5. Steam ALREADY EXISTS AND HAS ACHIEVED MARKET SATURATION.Please - if any part of Ubisoft is reading this, add it to the pile, we hate Uplay! We hate uplay, even the people who love your games (and I really enjoyed what I played of child of light!) hate uplay. Stop foisting it on people in an attempt to replicate valve - you will never replicate valve, as evidence by the fact that I am writing this review on steam, and so have many others.The game itselfNot without its flaws, the rhyming gets a bit repetitive, and the combat feels shallow in certain ways (repetitive abilities, recycled enemy art) yet is satisfying and the story and environment are delightful. I really enjoyed how it fused a fairy tale style with JRPG mechanics and was intrigued to see how it concluded. If you enjoy JRPGs, and like what you've seen from the screenshots and video I would hazard a purchase, just make sure you have an hour set aside to try it out in case you need a refund. I honestly would have happily finished this game, but every single time I went to play it, Uplay functioned as some sort of harassing butler that kept jabbering at me about sales and uplay points or some such nonsense. I'd give the games a thumbs up - but the shrieking visage of Uplay  is now linked to it via pavlovian response, so I give the two of them a thumbs down. If Uplay finally dies a death I will return to this game and edit my review.			"

												Yes, I know: UPlay is terrible. We all know that. So what if you can stomach that crap?First: I really, really wanted to like this game. It is beautiful to look at and a joy to explore. Everything's hand painted.That said, you are still left with an Extremely Hard turn-based strategy combat game. If you are exceedingly good at those Disciples games, then my recommendation is to buy this game. You will love it. If you are not exceedingly good at those Disciples games, you may hate this game.Guess which one I am? I just rage-uninstalled the game after my final, tedious boss fight. The highlight had to be finally humbling myself and moving down to the casual difficulty (inexplicably, there are only two difficulty levels). Even then, I was no closer to beating this particular boss.Better yet, after failing out of combat this last time, I ran around and collected little wisps to replenish my health and magic, but who the hell cares: I went back into that super-hard fight minus all the potions I used in desperation the last time. I had one of those moments like ""oh yeah, this happened last time.""I found potions in these ornate boxes with so much fun little mini-fanfare - like collecting candy - only to blow them all in one bad fight.If you need to farm, the game fails to convey it. You sure don't get much from the random combats out in the world. There is almost always a resource cost for any combat useful enough to gain XP from. As a result, I never had enough resources. Add to that the very last thing that I'm sooo tired of in this genre: The constant action interruptions and revive-fall-revive-run-away stoopid-loop that seems to characterize the games in this genre.I keep wanting to like this genre. I keep being disappointed. And yes, fanboys: I suck. So what. If you suck too, you will come to hate this beautiful horror.			"

The combat got a little stale after a while, but for a side-scrolling rpg that's pretty common imo. All in all, the gameplay was nothing revolutionary but it wasn't bad either, and the whole game is so darn pretty I can't help but love it.			"

												Not as delightful as I'd hoped. Combat is tiresome and very tense. Don't tell me I'm the only one who's upset by the idea of paying for character stat upgrades. This game has a lot of potential, but wears itself out thanks to Uplay DRM (which is a hassle), forgettable music and self-consciousness. Clearly written with an awareness of its themes, what is the point of bucking them all the time?This is a fantasy and it would have done far better playing to its strengths in that ""light"". If you're expecting something that plays as nicely as it looks, you haven't found it. Which is a true shame, as the artwork really is special - but regrettably, that's it. I'm not motivated to help Aurora win, and that is a true shame, because isn't that what this genre is supposed to do?			"

												I really tried to like this game, but (as an unpatient person) the game flows too slowly for me. It was really boring and the rhymes were out of place and too predictable, and sometimes they don't even try to rhyme! I was really disappointed. The flying gave me a headache, the fighting mechanics are annoying and bland, the rhymes are bad and the story is slow.I see people complaining about needing to sign up for uPlay but I didn't see that as a problem.Also, why would you have such a confusing and complicated ""skill tree"" and ""gem crafting"" system presented to me without any tutorials?I'm sorry ubisoft, you caught me with FarCry and Rayman but this didn't really do it for me...All in all, this game is too flawed for me to like.

												Though there is some fun to be had here, it felt like the story and pacing really unravelled into a mess by the end which colored the experience badly.  This game has fantastic artwork and an intersting new battle mechanic, but those things didn't make up for the negatives that grind down the experience from fun to boring.PROS:- Beautiful art- A new timing based battle mechanic with interrupt being a huge feature- Sometimes they mix up the battles to make you adapt, but it's rareCONS:- After initial excitement and discovery, it all becomes samey quickly- Too easy- even on expert I had tons of potions and crystals and only died once the whole game- The story is cute at first and then quickly becomes a mess that made me just want it just to end- very repetitive, became a slog for the 2nd half- clear best strategy once you get most of the characters that never was challenged "

												Not for experienced rogue-like RPG players.Yes, it has lovely pastel visuals. Yes, the dialogues rhyme. Yes, it actually has a pleasantly optimized battle system.It is also extremely EASY. I started the game on ""Casual"" and immediately switched to ""Expert"" because ""Casual"" played more like a peaceful demo than an RPG (""Casual"", - the name says it all).I mean, I can see why this game would be geared towards people like me - those who enjoy having a strong story, nice visuals, and simpler, easier battle that can just serve the story instead of presenting an additional and parallel challenge.I know we're not in Dark Souls territory here, but I like earning my victories and the Expert mode is barely making me work for it. If it's too easy for me, it's probably too easy for 90% of players out there.This would be a must-have game for youngsters (14-18 year olds) interested in getting into rogue-like RPGs. It's gentle enough, eases you into the battle and has an engrossing story.For experienced players though, the game would get old fast and the characters seem very over-powered for a real challenge to eventually develop.Now, if the previous warning hasn't changed your mind, here are all the wonderful things that this game has to offer.SPOILER WARNINGS (perhaps)In combat there is a time-dependent turn system that allows the player to skip ahead of enemies' turns if the right casts and potions are used. Each actor's time to next action can vary, sometimes spectacularly (you thought you were behind an enemy, but suddenly he is interrupted by your teammate and his TTNA is lengthened). This adds a level of interesting unpredictability to combat gameplay.Another useful bit of info that nobody else has mentioned: during battle the firefly glims generated when Igniculus ""shakes"" the light bushes are worth about twice Igniculus' light meter. For optimal utilization of the glims, always try to capture about half of the glims, then let the rest float around until the light meter is running low again. Otherwise, once the meter is full, any additional glims are going to waste.Ubisoft made the welcome change here of shifting cleric-type casts like healing and enemy debuffs outside of the turn system and onto the Igniculus character. This enables a more offensive dynamic to develop with PCs and focuses on matching attacks to enemies, timing offense and defense (NB: when enemy and player character are within the timer's ""red zone"" the preferred action should be defense), and generally making your party more proactive and less micro-managed.I personally spend most of battle with the Igniculus trigger enabled on one of the enemies, according to each of their turns in the battle sequence and their action speed.Party members start out ""pre-typed"" so to speak - Aurora is clearly a mage-type build, despite the big MFKN sword she receives at the beginning. The skill tree however, offers an opportunity to shift the character type more towards a melee fighter with strength and HP boosts. If that is your intention, I would recommend to either grind a bit at the beginning to earn Uplay credits that you can redeem for HP and strength bonuses, or maybe to wait for the right party member to join gameplay and mould it into the fighter that you want to have up-front and in the face of your enemies.Sadly there is no cover system, no grid and no distinction between melee and ranged fighting - a mage cast is equivalent to a physical attack, and each character has a primary physical attack. Honestly at my current level my characters are so OP that I can't tell if it makes a difference or not. The only noticeable thing is that my fighter character has MP that she never uses unless there's a major crisis like HP drastically low while Igniculus' meter is empty - in which case she can heal any party member (as a turn-based action). This permits for the fighter character to occasionally squeeze out a buff for the entire party at the beginning of a battle and just sit on the rest of the MP until needed at a later time.The gem upgrade system was also nice (called ""oculi"" in-game) with a no-nonsense elemental interdependence (fire, water, lightning) that allows you to have ridiculously unfair advantages against enemies. A typical attack makes almost triple the damage if the correct oculus (can I decline it that way?) is applied to the weapon.One thing that bothered me at the beginning was that when Aurora walked, the feet were misaligned with the path on which she was walking (it looked pretty half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for all the effort that was put into creating the backgrounds in the first place), but after the first boss-battle where the additional ability of flight is unlocked, and implicitly moving speed increases, that is no longer an issue.That being said, it's a nice game that's difficult to put down. If I had kids, I'd let them play this.Will update my review if my opinion changes before I beat the game.			"

												(disclaimer: I had heard that this game was easy so I played it on the harder difficulty, this may have underlined some of the faults and influenced my opinion)The overworld and sub-quests are not bad, but I won't go into much detail, because plenty of people talk about them.My complaint is with the interruption system in combat. If a character is attacked while preparing an action, they get knocked back on the timeline. The problem is that this is a feast or famine system; you're either obliterating the enemy or caught in an unwinnable situation.In the second half of the game, there are enemy combinations who will caste haste on their entire team and slow on your team. Add to that, that there can be 3 enemies, but only 2 of you. This leads to battles where you're consistently getting knocked back or put into a situation where all you can do is block or try to heal (basically never being able to damage the enemies to give yourself a chance). Then, you try the fight again and get a bit luckier (or are better equiped) and win easily in 2-3 turns.It really feels unbalanced, and I didn't enjoy it.			"

												Child of Light was one of those games for me, which I was hearing about from every corner, yet I was not sure if I should get it or not because it looks ""childish"" and ""cartoonish"". Well, I bought it during the Steam summer sale for 3,74€, I can say that this amount of money is well worth for the game. It took me a little over 9 hours to finish this game and I can say that it was time well spent. However, I dont see myself replaying this game at all. It's like one of thoose books where once you know who is the killer it doesnt motivate you to reread it because you know what will happen in the story. Your actions in the game doesnt alter the game ending in any way.In my opinion, this game is indeed kinda childish. I can see my younger sister to enjoy it, since she love stories like this but this game was definitely not made for adults. Its not the story and the characters which kept me playing this game, even the combat can be repetetive after some time.... but it was the execution and the presentation of the game which was presented to the player in a very stylish fashion. I cant say that I agree with the full price on this game, but if you can manage to get it for 50%-75% off, I say go for it. It is a beautiful one time ride.			"

												My girlfriend and I just finished Child of Light, and it was quite well done! Here are my thoughts.The visual presentation is stunning. We were both consistently blown away by how beautiful landscapes and characters were. Same goes for the soundtrack - as a pianist with a love of piano music, it resonated with me. Powerful yet serene, sorrowful and joyous.Gameplay was a nice mix between exploration / environment absorption and challenging combat. We played on Casual and felt it was suitable.The characters were each well-developed enough, memorable and provided enough variety combat-wise to make me care! This is often difficult.I absolutely loved the Oculi system - it provided both meaningful upgrades and creativity in crafting. Loads of room to experiment, too! I spent a lot of time wondering about gem combinations, which tier was the highest, can you combine diamond + onyx (yes = spinel!), etc.The co-op play was outstanding, too! GF does not like complicated systems and Igniculus let her help in both exploration and combat. Really reminds me of Wind Waker's Tingle Tuner asymmetric co-op gameplay. I'd love to see more of this approach to co-op.In short, Child of Light was an outstandingly strong game - cohesive, enticing and thoroughly enjoyable. 10/10, would recommend to everyone!			"

												This game... Well it has some pretty art and sometimes very demonstrative narrtive, which ends up inspiring at times. Characters are quite interesting and the gameplay sure is fun. If you add up more than just ""good"" musical score to it, it would seem like a fantastic game, but sadly it falls short. The story is nonexistent. It simply is not even there. There are elements to it, but the whole advanture seems like it would orchestrate a glorious finale and what do you get? NOTHING. If you want a short game with pretty presentation but ruptured narrative grab it. Otherwise, I'd recommend to buy it when it's on sale.			"

												UPlay problems aside (sigh, when will they learn....), this is actually an excellent little unique turn-based RPG. Think old style jrpg, but with a side scroller twist. Only a couple hours in, and it's already showing signs of being quite deep with a nice skill tree setup for character progression. Story seems a bit 'childish' (with a name like that, no surprise there) but it looks to be headed in deeper territory. Visually pleasing, with lots of variety to locales and cool effects. Very nice. Also expect plenty of chuckling as the dialogue is almost entirely done in rhymes.Thumbs up.			"

												It's like crime how Child of Light can rob you of your time.The combination of side-scrolling exploration, challenging turn-based tactical gameplay, amusing rhyming dialogues and a wonderful art style makes Child of Light an unusual but enjoyable gem.You'll quickly fall in love with the beatifully drawn landscapes of Lemuria as you travel through its dark forests, mountains and even under the sea. They are typically riddled with secret areas you can sniff out for treasure, puzzles or hidden bosses. Often there'll be more than one path to your destination, making exploration more interesting.During your travels, you'll meet many fun characters who'll give your quests, join you in your adventure, or both. My favourite was a female jester who couldn't do the dialogues in a proper rhyming fashion, allowing the other characters to jump in and correct her. Her healing abilities were also very welcome in a fight, making her one of my most used characters during combat.The combat is turn-based but has a real-time element that lets you delay enemies' turn or slightly heal your party out of turn. Timing this ability is important to winning encounters, as it lets you better use or avoid being the victim of the interrupt mechanic. Interrupting means hitting a character trying to perform an action, resulting in his turn being delayed. If you don't go for the easy difficulty, combat offers good and rewarding challenge that makes you invest time into considering how to specialise your characters.Each character has a network of specialisation trees, offering abilities unique to him while giving you a choice between the different paths. For example, there's a wizard who can specialise in lightning, water or fire, allowing him to excel against certain creature types vulnerable to his focused element. Another character can choose between improving his defense, his offense or his ability to direct enemy attacks against him.A problem that grows as the size of your party increases, is the frequency of level ups. Very quickly you'll be looking at one or multiple level ups after pretty much every battle as your characters gain levels and extra skill points to spend. It becomes tedious looking at the skill tree menu this often.Another part of character customisation is the Oculi system. Oculi are gems you gather and can use kind of like equipment items such as swords and armor in other games. They offer different bonuses depending on color and slot used, and can be combined to form more powerful gems. Oculi juggling gets a little cumbersome, but is nonetheless an important strategic element as you want to equip the right damage and resistance types depending on the opposition of your current area.Apart from having trouble with Steam starting the game through Uplay for some reason initially, the only bug I noticed in the actual game was that sometimes when entering combat, Aurora's (the main character) usually flowing hair wasn't drawn.If you're not playing on Easy difficulty and like to explore and look for secrets, you should expect around 20 hours of gameplay from Child of Light.TIP: While Child of Light offers controller support, I really must recommend using mouse and keyboard. You will need the precision to properly manage the real-time element of the otherwise turn-based combat.TIP: If, like me, you have trouble starting the game through Steam, try launching Uplay directly and start the game from there. After doing that, it's been working for me no problem.			"

												Written fully in verse and script,this game not once has gone and slipped.Through forests dark and fields fair,truly, I was amazed by Aurora's hair.Your quest, to restore the sun, stars, and moon.Somewhat average, not really a boon.Two difficulties that you'll have seen,Intrinsically opposed, you will glean.but truly, let there be no doubt,Child of Light should not be taken outof consideration because of Uplay,for, how many games would you not go play,if it were for something as simple as DRM?The mechanics, truly a fine ebb and flow,you must block and haste and stop and slow.You must heal and cast and hack and slash,for the battles are too complex for the button mash.Throuh oculi, your stats will thus increase,indeed, you must combine them to gain a releasefrom battles too strong for mere brute force,of which there are many, but no single courseis the be all-end all stratagem,which of course, is why I recommend this little gem.10/10			"

YouTube™ Video: Child of Light (Turbo Button Reviews) 

			Views: 44		

			Turbo Button Reviews is a series of short, sweet, and to the point video game reviews. In this episode, I review Child of Light, an artistic JRPG-esque game from Ubisoft.		

Too long; didn't watch -- Though the platforming elements are kind of thin and the threadbare story is never as involving as it's trying to be, Child of Light has a really great art style and a memorable combat system that keeps it compelling throughout.			"

												I picked this up today in the sale and so have barely even started, but I feel compelled to write a review anyway. If you haven't played it, I STRONGLY recommend that you do so. I'm only about an hour into it (up to just beyond the first boss) and I'm already spellbound. It's like a fairytale/Disney movie. The video sequences are all told via beautiful stained-glass scenes (remember the intro to Beauty And The Beast, or Sleeping Beauty? That.) The dialogue is often in rhyming couplets, which lends to the fairytale charm of the game. And don't get me started on the hand-drawn backgrounds or the music. Oh my God, the music. Outside of the Final Fantasy series, this is fast becoming my favourite soundtrack. Speaking of Final Fantasy, the combat is very similar in the sense that it is turn-based, dependant on speed - which I adore. I love the idea of the plot (the sun, moon and stars have been stolen and it's up to you to recover them - fantasy plots are my favourites.) Outside of combat, the game is played via side-scrolling environments. Everything just looks FANTASTIC. It lends further belief to the ""games are art"" ideology.I got this for just under £3. If you can get it that cheap for yourself, it's a no-brainer. If I'd known it was this great I would have got it a lot sooner, and happily paid the full price.			"

With several new companions joining your party throughout the game there are constantly new strategies to try out. The game is in the 10-20 hour range which in my opion is perfect. If you don't have a ton of time to play long winded RPGs I would highly recommend this game to get your fix.			"

It was really boring and the rhymes were out of place and too predictable, and sometimes they don't even try to rhyme! I was really disappointed. The flying gave me a headache, the fighting mechanics are annoying and bland, the rhymes are bad and the story is slow.I see people complaining about needing to sign up for uPlay but I didn't see that as a problem.Also, why would you have such a confusing and complicated ""skill tree"" and ""gem crafting"" system presented to me without any tutorials?I'm sorry ubisoft, you caught me with FarCry and Rayman but this didn't really do it for me...All in all, this game is too flawed for me to like.

												Though there is some fun to be had here, it felt like the story and pacing really unravelled into a mess by the end which colored the experience badly.  This game has fantastic artwork and an intersting new battle mechanic, but those things didn't make up for the negatives that grind down the experience from fun to boring.PROS:- Beautiful art- A new timing based battle mechanic with interrupt being a huge feature- Sometimes they mix up the battles to make you adapt, but it's rareCONS:- After initial excitement and discovery, it all becomes samey quickly- Too easy- even on expert I had tons of potions and crystals and only died once the whole game- The story is cute at first and then quickly becomes a mess that made me just want it just to end- very repetitive, became a slog for the 2nd half- clear best strategy once you get most of the characters that never was challenged "

												(disclaimer: I had heard that this game was easy so I played it on the harder difficulty, this may have underlined some of the faults and influenced my opinion)The overworld and sub-quests are not bad, but I won't go into much detail, because plenty of people talk about them.My complaint is with the interruption system in combat. If a character is attacked while preparing an action, they get knocked back on the timeline. The problem is that this is a feast or famine system; you're either obliterating the enemy or caught in an unwinnable situation.In the second half of the game, there are enemy combinations who will caste haste on their entire team and slow on your team. Add to that, that there can be 3 enemies, but only 2 of you. This leads to battles where you're consistently getting knocked back or put into a situation where all you can do is block or try to heal (basically never being able to damage the enemies to give yourself a chance). Then, you try the fight again and get a bit luckier (or are better equiped) and win easily in 2-3 turns.It really feels unbalanced, and I didn't enjoy it.			"

												Not for experienced rogue-like RPG players.Yes, it has lovely pastel visuals. Yes, the dialogues rhyme. Yes, it actually has a pleasantly optimized battle system.It is also extremely EASY. I started the game on ""Casual"" and immediately switched to ""Expert"" because ""Casual"" played more like a peaceful demo than an RPG (""Casual"", - the name says it all).I mean, I can see why this game would be geared towards people like me - those who enjoy having a strong story, nice visuals, and simpler, easier battle that can just serve the story instead of presenting an additional and parallel challenge.I know we're not in Dark Souls territory here, but I like earning my victories and the Expert mode is barely making me work for it. If it's too easy for me, it's probably too easy for 90% of players out there.This would be a must-have game for youngsters (14-18 year olds) interested in getting into rogue-like RPGs. It's gentle enough, eases you into the battle and has an engrossing story.For experienced players though, the game would get old fast and the characters seem very over-powered for a real challenge to eventually develop.Now, if the previous warning hasn't changed your mind, here are all the wonderful things that this game has to offer.SPOILER WARNINGS (perhaps)In combat there is a time-dependent turn system that allows the player to skip ahead of enemies' turns if the right casts and potions are used. Each actor's time to next action can vary, sometimes spectacularly (you thought you were behind an enemy, but suddenly he is interrupted by your teammate and his TTNA is lengthened). This adds a level of interesting unpredictability to combat gameplay.Another useful bit of info that nobody else has mentioned: during battle the firefly glims generated when Igniculus ""shakes"" the light bushes are worth about twice Igniculus' light meter. For optimal utilization of the glims, always try to capture about half of the glims, then let the rest float around until the light meter is running low again. Otherwise, once the meter is full, any additional glims are going to waste.Ubisoft made the welcome change here of shifting cleric-type casts like healing and enemy debuffs outside of the turn system and onto the Igniculus character. This enables a more offensive dynamic to develop with PCs and focuses on matching attacks to enemies, timing offense and defense (NB: when enemy and player character are within the timer's ""red zone"" the preferred action should be defense), and generally making your party more proactive and less micro-managed.I personally spend most of battle with the Igniculus trigger enabled on one of the enemies, according to each of their turns in the battle sequence and their action speed.Party members start out ""pre-typed"" so to speak - Aurora is clearly a mage-type build, despite the big MFKN sword she receives at the beginning. The skill tree however, offers an opportunity to shift the character type more towards a melee fighter with strength and HP boosts. If that is your intention, I would recommend to either grind a bit at the beginning to earn Uplay credits that you can redeem for HP and strength bonuses, or maybe to wait for the right party member to join gameplay and mould it into the fighter that you want to have up-front and in the face of your enemies.Sadly there is no cover system, no grid and no distinction between melee and ranged fighting - a mage cast is equivalent to a physical attack, and each character has a primary physical attack. Honestly at my current level my characters are so OP that I can't tell if it makes a difference or not. The only noticeable thing is that my fighter character has MP that she never uses unless there's a major crisis like HP drastically low while Igniculus' meter is empty - in which case she can heal any party member (as a turn-based action). This permits for the fighter character to occasionally squeeze out a buff for the entire party at the beginning of a battle and just sit on the rest of the MP until needed at a later time.The gem upgrade system was also nice (called ""oculi"" in-game) with a no-nonsense elemental interdependence (fire, water, lightning) that allows you to have ridiculously unfair advantages against enemies. A typical attack makes almost triple the damage if the correct oculus (can I decline it that way?) is applied to the weapon.One thing that bothered me at the beginning was that when Aurora walked, the feet were misaligned with the path on which she was walking (it looked pretty half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for all the effort that was put into creating the backgrounds in the first place), but after the first boss-battle where the additional ability of flight is unlocked, and implicitly moving speed increases, that is no longer an issue.That being said, it's a nice game that's difficult to put down. If I had kids, I'd let them play this.Will update my review if my opinion changes before I beat the game.			"

												This is a beautiful game! The visual design and soundtrack are absolutely gorgeous. In terms of plot, it was pretty typical fairy tale-esque fare-- nothing to write home about, but certainly not bad! The combat got a little stale after a while, but for a side-scrolling rpg that's pretty common imo. All in all, the gameplay was nothing revolutionary but it wasn't bad either, and the whole game is so darn pretty I can't help but love it.			"

It doesn't have much depth and battle mechanics are only enjoyable in expert difficult, other than that, a great game to get on a sale. The only downsize of it is that it requires a 3rd party software (Uplay). Recomended :)			"

												I must say, this game, if you can even call it a ""game"", has a wonderful way of pulling you into the world with Aurora. This beautifully told bedtime story speaks in rhymes as it flows through time. Speaking of the gameplay, it is PERFECT. I have encounter many RPG's and in almost all of them it feels like you have NO control of the battlefield. Always something that seems insurmountable. But with  Child of Light , you have total control, while still facing a great challenge. I just only wish that there could be a sequel of  some sort, or atleast another very similar game like this!If you're looking for a great story and very well-done gameplay mechanics, this is the game for you!**I played and finished this game on my PS Vita.**			"

												Beautiful game with music to match.  It's got a battle system that's similar to the JRPG Grandia series, which is a lot of fun.  Battles have a timeline where characters and enemies have to wait until it's their turn and actions take differing amounts of time to perform.  Get hit during your action time and you get interrupted.  The same goes for enemies.  Strategy gets enhanced by buffs/debuffs, counters, and the ability to swap characters instantly on your turn.I was able to get through on Expert fairly easily without any time spent grinding for levels, although I didn't avoid any enemies as I enjoyed the battle system too much.  Leveling up grants you skill points which you can spend on one of 3 branches of the skill tree.			"

												Only rating the game here, not Uplay.Ubisoft Montreal delivers a very charming if short game. The protagonist, Aurora, daughter of the Duke of Austria, finds herself awakening in the mystical land Lemuria which has fallen under the spell of the Queen of the Night. Aurora is tasked by the Lady of the Forest to free the Lemurians from the suffocating reign and bring back the light, all the while she tries to get home to her father, who is dying of grief over Auroras's supposed death.The gameplay features elements of a JRPG, with a growing cast of supporting characters aiding Aurora in her quest, character development and a hybrid turn-based and real-time combat system. Yet the game is a sidescroller with some puzzles and plattforming in the mix.The game really is rather short but sweet, features artful visuals plus a terrific musical score. I really can't say anything bad about the game besides the lack of variety in endings which was hinted at by the developers. So, for 15 bucks you get around 10 hours worth of content for the basic game, and a New Game Plus Mode (which I can't say anything about because I haven't played it yet). If you can put up with Uplay, it's worth of your time.			"

												Where to start? This game does have a very nice story. The only problem I have with it was a somewhat abrupt ending. I still strongly recommend the game however.  This is one of those games that makes you want more of everything in a good way.Quite simply, the music is addicting. I do wish the sound track did have the vocal track version heard in the game. The DLC does add a nice boost to the game with an additional character.  Graphics: It feels as if you are playing in a painting that was done by watercolor. It is THAT good. Smooth animations. Music: As mentioned above, one of the absolute best parts of the gameGameplay: You have a hefty amount of skills and a fairly simple crafting system. The controls are smooth and easy to use. Though I recommend strongly using a controller.Overall: 10/10, I haven't enjoyed a game like this in a while. Another good one I enjoyed was Fable.			"

												Play. This. Game. It's beautiful, atmospheric, the dialogue rhymes, and it reminds me of a much happier version of Limbo, with combat. The RPG style character progression trees/weapon augments and interesting battle system make me very very happy that I preodered this game. Mastering how to use your little firefly friend to slow down enemies as their meter builds is not only innovative and capitivating, as it's better than just sitting there waiting for you turn, but I can tell that it will become an essential tactic later on. This game is adorable, but still a very legitimate RPG title I thoroughly reccommend picking up. DLC as well, since the extra augments and stat buff items help you out early on. :D			"

												Child of Light is a fairytale themed RPG/adventure game with puzzles and turn based combat. The visual presentation is just perfect - like animated pages from childrens storybooks. I was therefore quite disappointed to find out that there is no voice acting, and very little spoken narration. IMHO that could've elevated the experience a great deal.The story is as a fairytale should be, and full of colorful and diverse characters.The gameplay itself is somewhat shallow though. The puzzles are easy, and there isn't much tactical depth in the combat.I didn't finish all the side quests, but still spent close to 10 hours in the lovely magical world of Lemuria.70%			"

												UPlay problems aside (sigh, when will they learn....), this is actually an excellent little unique turn-based RPG. Think old style jrpg, but with a side scroller twist. Only a couple hours in, and it's already showing signs of being quite deep with a nice skill tree setup for character progression. Story seems a bit 'childish' (with a name like that, no surprise there) but it looks to be headed in deeper territory. Visually pleasing, with lots of variety to locales and cool effects. Very nice. Also expect plenty of chuckling as the dialogue is almost entirely done in rhymes.Thumbs up.			"

												It's like crime how Child of Light can rob you of your time.The combination of side-scrolling exploration, challenging turn-based tactical gameplay, amusing rhyming dialogues and a wonderful art style makes Child of Light an unusual but enjoyable gem.You'll quickly fall in love with the beatifully drawn landscapes of Lemuria as you travel through its dark forests, mountains and even under the sea. They are typically riddled with secret areas you can sniff out for treasure, puzzles or hidden bosses. Often there'll be more than one path to your destination, making exploration more interesting.During your travels, you'll meet many fun characters who'll give your quests, join you in your adventure, or both. My favourite was a female jester who couldn't do the dialogues in a proper rhyming fashion, allowing the other characters to jump in and correct her. Her healing abilities were also very welcome in a fight, making her one of my most used characters during combat.The combat is turn-based but has a real-time element that lets you delay enemies' turn or slightly heal your party out of turn. Timing this ability is important to winning encounters, as it lets you better use or avoid being the victim of the interrupt mechanic. Interrupting means hitting a character trying to perform an action, resulting in his turn being delayed. If you don't go for the easy difficulty, combat offers good and rewarding challenge that makes you invest time into considering how to specialise your characters.Each character has a network of specialisation trees, offering abilities unique to him while giving you a choice between the different paths. For example, there's a wizard who can specialise in lightning, water or fire, allowing him to excel against certain creature types vulnerable to his focused element. Another character can choose between improving his defense, his offense or his ability to direct enemy attacks against him.A problem that grows as the size of your party increases, is the frequency of level ups. Very quickly you'll be looking at one or multiple level ups after pretty much every battle as your characters gain levels and extra skill points to spend. It becomes tedious looking at the skill tree menu this often.Another part of character customisation is the Oculi system. Oculi are gems you gather and can use kind of like equipment items such as swords and armor in other games. They offer different bonuses depending on color and slot used, and can be combined to form more powerful gems. Oculi juggling gets a little cumbersome, but is nonetheless an important strategic element as you want to equip the right damage and resistance types depending on the opposition of your current area.Apart from having trouble with Steam starting the game through Uplay for some reason initially, the only bug I noticed in the actual game was that sometimes when entering combat, Aurora's (the main character) usually flowing hair wasn't drawn.If you're not playing on Easy difficulty and like to explore and look for secrets, you should expect around 20 hours of gameplay from Child of Light.TIP: While Child of Light offers controller support, I really must recommend using mouse and keyboard. You will need the precision to properly manage the real-time element of the otherwise turn-based combat.TIP: If, like me, you have trouble starting the game through Steam, try launching Uplay directly and start the game from there. After doing that, it's been working for me no problem.			"

												This game is simply beautiful - from the hand-drawn graphics to the soothing background music. The battle music is epic and reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII. The turn-based combat is nicely unique with the option of using your little glow-worm friend to slow down opponents and heal allies, giving you the chance to get that all important potion or cast in before you're anhilated. Combat is not your usual one-shot-as-you-go, and I admit a couple of the boss fights have taken me a couple of attempts. There is also a nice option to switch out your allies mid-fight to give you the upper edge. Game is not quick to play - the story unwinds slowly as you meet new characters. I've been playing for about 2.5 hours and have only just reached chapter 4/10. The skill/talent tree is also reminiscent of the Final Fantasy games. The puzzles are interesting to complete. As a bonus, if you're playing this single-player, you also get to control your little friend too, which can be a bit tricky to manage both to begin with, but you soon get the hang of it.The only downfall I found was the jumping - until you recieve the ability to fly, the jumps are very tight and can be difficult to make with a controller as I couldn't quite get the right diagonal key-press. I found myself putting down the controller and using the directional arrows on my keyboard to complete the jumps - much easier. This, obviously, is no longer an issue once you gain flying. Overall I give this game 10/10. It's fun, quirky, engaging, and not over-simplified. And guys - don't dismiss this game as being girly. Give it a try, you never know you might like it!			"

The gameplay is ""unique"" with its realtime but turn based battles and a dash of puzzles. The great thing is, you dont have to grind your party so much like other RPG, infact for a normal difficulty, you litterally just fight enemies you came across to without grinding and you'll fight the bosses just fine. All-in-all, Child of Light is a great game. Good story, challenging yet not hard battles, great music, and a very beautifull atrwork.			"

												It's a solid RPG with nice storybook-esque graphics and an interesting turn-based combat mechanic. But good lord, the rhyming, make it stop. EVERY line of dialogue is made to rhyme, in many cases taking great lengths to awkwardly word things to match the sounds. It's a shame really, I get that it's going for a storybook style, but to rhyme EVERYTHING just gets really annoying fast, and I find myself going through dialogue as quickly as possible because of it. Aside from that and having to use *shudder* uplay, it's a fun and enjoyable game.			"

												I have to say that I really like this game. It is a great example of how games can be considered art.Child of Light is a lighthearted RPG-platformer crossover with wonderful art and a beautiful (!) soundtrack. The tactical battle system is simple enough that it fits nicely with the casual fairy tale style of the story, but is still deep enough not to be boring even after the myriad of battles you'll face throughout the game. In addition, all dialogue is presented as poetry; although the rhythms are quite irregular and the rhymes are a bit of a stretch sometimes, it is overall very entertaining. Especially recommended for RPG fans who want a relaxing break from heavier and longer games.			"

												Child of Light is a fairytale roleplaying game in the vein of many fondly remembered children's stories.  Aurora, first born princess of the Austrian King, falls to illness and is transported to the fantastical land of Lemuria--a kingdom of monsters and anthropomorphic animals alike.  It is in both the adequately written prose and beautiful illustrations that one feels they are interacting in a proper storybook.  The gameplay also draws from a long-line of classic influences; side-scrolling areas are subtle in their similarities to Metroid-vania games, while the battle system is turn-based and real-time with a smattering of Grandia's system of delaying and interrupting actions with carefully timed attacks.The combination of beautiful illustrations, a lullaby-like soundtrack, and a nostalgic battle system enticed me to return each day to learn a little more about Aurora's newfound whereabouts.  While dialogue between characters is again illustrated with beautiful character profiles, the conversations themselves can feel a little contrived at times--granted, I would snicker here and there.  Each part of Lemuria is broken up by chapters and again highlight the range of beauty that the game's artists are capable of showing us.  Animations are smooth and the use of lighting for backgrounds and objects really adds to the fantasy.In the end, I found myself enjoying Child of Light for what it was trying to be; an interactive storybook that subtly entices you to turn each page carefully and deliberately in the hopes that you'll get lost in it.  At the same time, I was disappointed by that very thing--a mostly pretty game with a fun story that doesn't demand that you invest in their characters beyond some archetypical quirks.			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Nearly all of the game's dialogue (which is primarily text-only, with spoken narration for cutscenes) is in a poetic rhyming format. Personally, I find this quite annoying, and it distracts me from the text's actual content. However, I did find a character (party member, even) that goes out of her way to use a word that does NOT rhyme, when there's a better-fitting word that DOES rhyme, after which another character corrects them. I find this somewhat amusing.The combat, however, piques my interest. First off, it uses a ""turn-time"" system, whereby faster units take more turns than slower ones, as opposed to Pokemon (for example) where speed only determines who moves first in a turn, yet everyone still gets the same number of turns. However, this game takes it a step farther; each unit's turn is split into a wait period and a cast period. Once a unit's wait period finishes, they select an action and proceed to the cast period. Once the cast period is done, the action occurs. However, an action can be interrupted if the unit is hit while in their cast period. This results in a lot of strategy in manipulating the timers, especially given the fact that you can pick an enemy and slow them down nearly any time.I read a lot of reviews that mentioned having problems with Uplay, be it the inabilty to play or having saves erased. I haven't had these issues. I also read that you should use Uplay in offline mode, which I've done thus far.SECOND IMPRESSIONS:Now that I have more than two party members, I now see how party swapping works. It's kind of wierd. At first, I thought it was the same as FF10; on a player unit's turn, you can swap him/her out for any other player unit not already active, and this is completely seamless and takes no time. But there's another option. Lets say you have three party members, named A, B, and C. A is picking an action. B is on the field, but waiting to act. C is off the field. You can use A's action to swap C in for B, and this will cause A's turn to be spent, but C is now immediately ready to act. Confusing? Yeah, I thought so too. As a result, I only use the swap-for-self method that FF10 uses.I'd also like to comment on the art style. It has its own unique fantasy charm. I like to describe it as the developer being on juuuust the right amount of drugs.THIRD IMPRESSIONS:Dang, the game is getting hard.There's two difficulty levels, Casual and Expert. I picked Expert. The difficulty was high, but managable until recently. It's getting quite brutal at this point. I'm managing, but only barely.And I'm loving it. BRING IT ON!			"

												This game is simply beautiful - from the hand-drawn graphics to the soothing background music. The battle music is epic and reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII. The turn-based combat is nicely unique with the option of using your little glow-worm friend to slow down opponents and heal allies, giving you the chance to get that all important potion or cast in before you're anhilated. Combat is not your usual one-shot-as-you-go, and I admit a couple of the boss fights have taken me a couple of attempts. There is also a nice option to switch out your allies mid-fight to give you the upper edge. Game is not quick to play - the story unwinds slowly as you meet new characters. I've been playing for about 2.5 hours and have only just reached chapter 4/10. The skill/talent tree is also reminiscent of the Final Fantasy games. The puzzles are interesting to complete. As a bonus, if you're playing this single-player, you also get to control your little friend too, which can be a bit tricky to manage both to begin with, but you soon get the hang of it.The only downfall I found was the jumping - until you recieve the ability to fly, the jumps are very tight and can be difficult to make with a controller as I couldn't quite get the right diagonal key-press. I found myself putting down the controller and using the directional arrows on my keyboard to complete the jumps - much easier. This, obviously, is no longer an issue once you gain flying. Overall I give this game 10/10. It's fun, quirky, engaging, and not over-simplified. And guys - don't dismiss this game as being girly. Give it a try, you never know you might like it!			"

												Talk about a beautiful and engaging game. Child of Light is an RPG from Ubisoft Montreal. Let’s get rocking.The GoodFirstly, the thing that struck me the most about this game is the art. The artwork is beautiful in every sense of the word. It has a distinctive, watercolor style and it works splendidly with the premise of the game. You’ll really feel like you’re playing through a storybook and it is a wonderful experience.The story of the game is pretty good and it is filled with interesting characters (and enemies). The game world itself is a great canvas on which the story is able to unfold. It’s imaginative, original, and refreshing.There’s a good variety of enemy types for you to take on during the course of the game. There’s more than enough to keep you interested in combat.The combat system itself is very old school. It’s set on a timer, and you’ll need to time your character’s attacks if you don’t want to get interrupted and have to take a penalty on your timer.The BadAs far as RPGs go, I typically go in expecting to have at least a good handful of items to equip my character/party with. While CoL does have some items, it is quite lacking on the changeable weapons front.The MehEven if you get this one through Steam, you’ll be having to play it through Uplay.Verdict: YeaChild of Light is a solid RPG and a worthwhile addition to any collection (and that is just for the artwork alone). You can find it in the Steam Store and with the Halloween Sale (most likely) just around the corner, you should keep an eye out for this one. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												This game will melt your heart. It has been some time since I had last been emotionally touched by a game. But the princess is just so cute, especially when she is weighed down by her large sword after holding it up for a victory. Awww!! The dialogues are often cute and funny, I also didn't think the riming got tiresome, but maybe that's because I'm not a native speaker. The soundtrack is great and wonderfully adds to the atmosphere.The story is a bit in between. It's very nicely presented with the dialogues and all, but there is little meat on the bone if you look at it more closely. Still, the game is not very long, so no big drawback.At some point the battles will become a bit drawn out and you'll find yourself battling just for the XP and maybe some oculi loot. That's a shame, considering you'll spend so much time battling. Personally, considering the style of the game, I would have preferred spending more time exploring the world.			"

												I love this game, it's one of the best games I've played in a really long time. This is also my first time writing a review on steam. I beat this game a few times on steam and even went out and bought it for my ps vita cause I loved it so much. It has a great storyline to it, and the music is amazin as well. Has a group of characters you use like any rpg, but you find them throughout the game. Beautiful graphics as well, it's just an all around fun and amazing game. Although I believe they took out some content before they relased the game, I noticed Aurora had a fireball or meteor strike spell, you can see her use it int he video. But She has no such spell in the actual game, bummer. I think they did that cause since she is the ""Child of Light"" They only wanted to give her Light spells. But yes I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Child of Light is a remarkable adventure. Once I accepted the sadness that is so intertwined with every element, I grew so much closer to Child of Light. It's easy to heap praise on the combat because it's so engaging, and it's certainly a high point in this adventure. That's not what makes Child of Light stand out, though. Rather, it's how confident it is in its own feelings of woe. There are so few games willing to explore that dull ache that I became mesmerized by Aurora's journey, even when I needed to step away from her plight while I regained my composure. Child of Light is a wonderfully realized, somber adventure, and I couldn't be happier that such a game exists.Ignore the Uplay naysayers; it really doesn't change anything.			"

Ubisoft have stated that they took a big risk with this game, it is not their typical triple A title that must be churned out year on end.How glad I am that they took a chance on this game!an Astounding soundtrack by Coeur de Pirate, compelling storyline, diverse and interesting characters and involved RPG mechanics akin to the final fantasy series all come together to create a game so atmospheric I found it difficult to put down. Once you do complete the game there is the chance to go back and play again with the same stats and oculi (stat modifying crystals) so that you can unlock every skill for each character ( I finished my first playthrough at level 49)You can also play it co operatively as a second player can control the firefly igniculus who can heal allies and slow foes down, reach areas Aurora can't and illuminate the dark.10/10			"

												A land missing its lost Queen. A lost girl missing her Mother. The Queen of the Night who has lost her way. Help Aurora on her quest to restore balance to Lemuria.I wasn't expecting much when I purhcased this game. It was recommended by a friend and I picked it up fairly cheaply. Once I began playing I understood why it was recommended to me - I love fairy tales and fables. The game tells its story entirely in rhyme, or at least near rhyme in the case of one character who can't quite grasp the concept. It might be an odd thing to bring up first but I assure you that the dialogue in game is an integral part as it draws you in and immerses you in the birghtly colored pastel and watercolor world of Lemuria. The combat is also quite well done, with a bit of an extra twist that you'll soon find almost second nature.			"

												Loved this game as an experience. It is beautifully crafted in everyway. Gameplay wise it leaves you wanting a little more variety, but it was very fun for me from beginning to end. I loved getting the hang of maximizing the effectiveness of your turns with a subtle dance of switching out characters, buffing and debuffing, and timing. The story is emotional and intriguing, the visuals are mezmerizing, the soundtrack is enchanting. Simply a beautiful game through and through. Also, loved that this takes place in Lemuria, and the hidden fibonacci spiral in one of the quests  ;)			"

												Remember when you were younger? Your parents would tell you bedtime stories about magic, heroes, and princesses in a land far away. That fantasy was real and made you want to be the best you could be. This game requires you to tap into your inner child when impossibility was only improbability. The entire game is like bedtime story with magic adventures, epic battles, and music always remind you to view it not as reality, but as you wish things could've been from your childhood. Every line of dialogue makes you pulled in by its innocence. If you can find your childhood innocence this is the game for you.10/10			"

												    Child of Light is a beautiful game that has many elements of other types of games that have before it while combining them in fantastic ways. I received this game as a gift from a close friend and immediately began to play it without hesitation. I quickly fell in love with this game due to its adorable gimmicks and lovable characters. Aurora is a cute little princess who seems too good to be true, and remains strong even though the weight of the world weighs down on her. Let's get to a little list of positives and negatives!Positives- As previously said, the characters are cute and lovable, while all having their own personalities.- The ability trees are very interesting and let you build characters in many different ways to create a team as you see fit.- The DLC is cheap if you're interested and adds in some more colorful characters, which I only recently discovered.- The storyline is sweet with amazing cutscenes that love to show off all of the hard work put into this game.- The quests are all very direct which makes the game a bit linear (if you enjoy that) but also allows wiggle room if you like to do side quests.- All side quests that I've found give really good rewards while not being too easy or difficult.- The puzzles are simple enough while still being entertaining in the few places that they show up.Negatives- Aurora can often be seen as too picture perfect even if it is part of her charm.- You can bypass a lot of companions if you aren't paying careful attention.- Although the new game plus is fun and adds to the game, it's important to take into consideration that nothing changes except for the levels, which kind of dries the game out.- Theres no type of multiplayer unless you hand somebody your mouse so they can be your little firefly friend, which gets boring quickly.    This is a decent list of some vague things in the game that are obvious once you play it a bit, although it should give you a good enough idea of whether or not you'd like to buy it. The game is personally one of my favorites and I adore the pleasing feeling of freedom you receive when you have the ability to fly around like a fairy while looking at the picturesque landscape of the stages you go through. This game is entirely worth it if you're a fan of fairytales, books, poetry, or platformers.			"

												If you already played Grandia I or II, you will find this game pretty familiar. It's like Grandia in 2d perspective!The Good:- Great animation- Great Music and Sound Effects- Good History- Mechanics similar to Grandia ( Although Grandia is better in this aspect)- Decent ammount of customizationThe Bad:- The need to install Uplay and update manually directly from website in order to run the game. However, once making an account on uplay, you can remove all options of uplay overlay. - Character walks a bit slow but later you can move faster.- DLC's are not big deal. It just give to you freebies that you can acquire on game. The only ones that are worthy: Golem pack , Dark Aurora and Light Aurora, due to additional character and skins.- The game did ran slow to me. I've needed to do some steps in order to fix:  *  Needed to put on Full screen  *  Auto-hide the desktop bar  *  Used Razer Cortex to increase the speedAfter this it worked like charm and I've got 66-90 fps which is great! Overall, I recommend to get this game and don't be  afraid because of the other DRM.			"

Anyway, thanks a lot, himmatsj :-)Here goes the original review:I've heard of Child Of Light when it first released and I love dat fancy stories and artworks the game provides, so I didn't hesitate to buy this on the sale this weekend. Then I get to know this Uplay, spent half a day dealing with it and fail to play the game at last. Thought about requesting a refund but have no idea if the DLCs are refondable, so I ended up writing this review here.I guess I'll go for a pirate version of this game to have fun, how pathetic.			"

												One of the reasons why I bought this game in the first place was because of it's artistic look. This game owns the most beautiful backgrounds I've ever seen. The story itself is also pretty good - even tho am not used to play games that own a plot which sounds like it has been taken out of a children's book. The game itself is pretty enjoyable. I like to collect stuff and find some hidden areas - this game has both of 'em surprisingly much which keeps the player busy.Even if you wouldn't like to look for extra items - the game still has a lot to offer.So yeah, I really enjoyed playing this game, but there's only one teeny tiny minus. When I was about to face the boss - I was expecting something new and exiting, but instead - the fights stayed pretty much the same. The only difference was that it took some more time to kill the enemy. ""Face the enemy, kick it's butt, done. Face the enemy, kick it's butt, done..."". The longer the pattern keeped on going - the more boring the game started to feel like. But don't take this the wrong way - it really is a good game.8/10			"

												I have to say that I really like this game. It is a great example of how games can be considered art.Child of Light is a lighthearted RPG-platformer crossover with wonderful art and a beautiful (!) soundtrack. The tactical battle system is simple enough that it fits nicely with the casual fairy tale style of the story, but is still deep enough not to be boring even after the myriad of battles you'll face throughout the game. In addition, all dialogue is presented as poetry; although the rhythms are quite irregular and the rhymes are a bit of a stretch sometimes, it is overall very entertaining. Especially recommended for RPG fans who want a relaxing break from heavier and longer games.			"

												A land missing its lost Queen. A lost girl missing her Mother. The Queen of the Night who has lost her way. Help Aurora on her quest to restore balance to Lemuria.I wasn't expecting much when I purhcased this game. It was recommended by a friend and I picked it up fairly cheaply. Once I began playing I understood why it was recommended to me - I love fairy tales and fables. The game tells its story entirely in rhyme, or at least near rhyme in the case of one character who can't quite grasp the concept. It might be an odd thing to bring up first but I assure you that the dialogue in game is an integral part as it draws you in and immerses you in the birghtly colored pastel and watercolor world of Lemuria. The combat is also quite well done, with a bit of an extra twist that you'll soon find almost second nature.			"

												I really love this game. If you are unsure about it and you really like adventure, fantasy games with a good story, I high suggest you try it. If you are still not sure, try watching gameplay hopefully that would be helpful. ALSO, if you have already played this and don't know what to play next try Ori and the Blind Forest. It has similar level ups. But you can only level your self, from what i have played so far.			"

												The most enjoyable RPG I've played in a long time. Its mechanics are solid, easy to pick up and play, and never seem to leave me bored like so many other RPGs. Its a little on the light-weight side, but its design is very intuitive and to the point, but still presenting a challenge. It has checks and balances against ""min-maxing"", but that's often done simply. The progression system is also simple compared to older RPGs and some modern one (though much more advanced than, say, games like Final Fantasy 13 or World of Warcraft). The story is very nice and inspiring, very melancholy and darkly beautiful. Its like looking through the eyes of an innocent child at a destitute world; that's pretty much the theme throughout. Its more than the sum of its parts in the emotions which it evokes.Its a long-run RPG but ends abruptly, however it still manages to wrap things up nicely. As far as I can tell, there are no end-game quests, no ""ultimate weapons"" to be had, which I find somewhat disapointing. I know there's some things I haven't completed, but I'm not holding my breath for anything like, say Final Fantasy 8's endgame.All in all its a great game, and one of the best of its generation of games (Xbox 360 era till now).

												This game just flat out awed me and filled me so full of nostalgic feelings for the RPGs I played on my Playstation when I was a young girl. What I love most was the battle system which was a slightly more dynamic version of the turn-based Active Time Battle system used in many older Final Fantasy games. The visuals are beautiful and the story is entertaining and poetic. I thoroughly enjoyed all the different party members and the game's plot. Literally, my only disappointment is I wish this game was longer, because I didn't want it to end so soon. Also, it requires Uplay, a client provided through Ubisoft. Based on other reviews, it appears to be finicky. But I didn't seem to experience any problems with it. Even after I had nearly stopped playing the game for a year and went back to play it again later, I incurred no serious issues with the Uplay service.If you're into RPGs you should definitely give this game a try. And if you're not too familiar with the style of RPGs, don't worry. This game is straight forward, easy to get into and quite intuitive when it comes to controls.			"

												Friends. Family, Hope. Find all of these things in the game and disregard the real-life counterparts. Withdraw from all social events involving your friends and family. Procrastinate even more skilfully and deftly with this charming and deceptively strategic RPG. And, if you're a student like me, disappoint your parents even further by spending an embarrassingly large amount of time before the screen, watching little animals violently flog one another to death. Because my goodness is this game glorious.This game has it all : storyline engineered to make you cry, beautiful watercolour artwork, simple yet strategic gameplay, treasure hunting, side quests, crafting, levelling up (with the possibility of grinding if you're into that), hauntingly heartbreaking music and sexy rats in finery and merpeople (again if you're into that). The world and gameplay are utterly absorbing, such that 7pm quickly becomes 10pm and you give up on doing your essay and instead consign yourself to playing for another couple of hours because it's already late and you're kinda tired and what can you do.  I'll speak on the strongest part of the game (and arguably the most important part) : gameplay.So the game incorporates the Active Battle System (Active Time Battle ? Active Battle Time ?) seen in early Final Fantasy games - in other words, the player and the enemy each have a bar that charges up, and when it is full they may ""cast"", or complete an action, be it attacking, defending, taunting or buffing allies up with freakish dancing. An interesting component (or two) included in this game is the ability to interrupt an action by hitting the character in mid-""cast"", causing the interrupted to have to refill their charge bar. Time it right and the enemy will never land a hit on you, whereupon the aforementioned flogging takes place. Alternatively, panic as you yourself are trapped in such a vicious cycle of flogging and swear under your breath because the enemy is too many and too fast, and you are too slow and weak and pitiful or both. You also have the ability to manually slow down the enemy (or heal yourself) by clicking and holding the mouse (although it's a firefly in the game) over the characters, allowing you to turn the tide of battle or at least give yourself a bit more breathing room if you're getting absolutely pummelled. There is nothing more satisfying than defeating a boss that you have branded as being ""cheap"" and ""too fast"" in the first minute of battle, nothing more elating than having your frustrated despair abruptly change to malicious glee as you discover the proper strategy required to take them out, and there is absolutely nothing that trumps the feeling of having successfully carried out your petty vengeance by dealing an inordinately and unnecessarily large amount of damage to an enemy barely clinging on to life. Eat it !  So concludes the more positive part of the review.The negative part is a lot smaller and miniscule in importance.Essentially, if rhymed poetry is not your friend, or if rhyming in general just gets on your nerves, watch out. The entire game is composed of rhymes, and some of them wholly repetitive. There's only so many words you can rhyme with ""bye"" or ""me"" (actually that's a lie, there's a huge amount that rhymes with those two words, but in the context of a video game, let alone a conversation in a video game ? I think not). You can also collect collectibles in the form of ""confessions"" (essentially background history) which is also completely composed of rhyme. And this time the language is a lot more sophisticated. So if you're lazy, a bad reader (which means you should've stopped reading this review a good 5 paragraphs back), a second language speaker (I joke) or simply rhymephobic, avoid at all costs. But because this game is a combat game and not a reading poetry game, I'd have to say that its impact on the game is fairly minimum.Anyway. Buy it. Play it. Love it. Finish it. Then don't touch it again until nostalgia brings it to the forefront of your mind.			"

												This game practically masters the ""Fable"" aesthetic; the story is engaging and is written with a verse-based whimsy that is infused with a depth unheard of in games of this tone. The 2.5D art design is out-of-this-world, and further strengthens the pedigree of the UbiArt engine. The sole issue hampering this game is the Final-Fantasy-style combat; while the strategy involved in timing hits is somewhat engaging, the sheer, samey repetitiveness of it, in addition to the lack of useful info on enemy stats, make the idea of playing on anything other than Casual untenable. 4/5			"

												First off: This game is incredible. The soundtrack, the watercolor background, the immersive story. It genuinely makes you care about the characters. The only complaints I have are that the 10 hours that you get to play it through aren't enough. Second, there's so much to explore. As in most open-world games I try not to stray to far from the intended path of the game until beating it, and miss out on tons of side-quests that improve the game, but I found I never cared if I spent 20 minutes exploring a cave when I should have been saving Lemuria. Every single moment I played this game has been awesome. The combat mechanics are simple to learn and are an awesome variation from boring regular turn-based combat. I can not stop saying good things about this game, it is truly a work of art and I definitely recommend getting it. I'd also recommend the Golem's Plight DLC pack, as having another character on the team helps a lot and the Golem is a lot of fun to use. The Dark Aurora skin is my personal favorite, though the heal skill of the Light Pack is very useful. If you feel like spending an extra $7, get the Light and Dark Packs, and the Golem's Plight. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did!			"

												I've been waiting to play this game for months. This game hyped me a lot, because I like the platform games mixed with fantasy. But Ubi took it further and added the RPG to it (I'm not a big fan of Ubi, that's why I'm pleased with the outcome). It reminds me a lot to Odin Sphere, and I love that game. So I decided to pick this game. And I think that's probably the best game I bought lately.And the soundtrack, I love it, Coeur de Pirate made something beautiful. I'm not going to rate the game out of 10 or out of 5 because I don't see the point. But I will tell my friends to buy it, because is one of the best games that you can play this years.			"

												Warning: Indepth reviewVisuals-Gorgeous watercolor artstyle-Charming/cute fairytale-like character designs-Extremely beautiful and detailed environments and scenery aided by the artstyle-High attention to detail for character/skill animations. E.g, main character fumbles around a lot while wielding/using her sword because it is practically the same size as herAudio-Eargasmic fully orchestrated soundtracks-Music styles range from lighthearted disneylike bgm to intense, adrenaline pumping musical scores to sombre, lonely, melancholic pieces-Soundtracks that play during normal monster battles are so epic that they feel more like final boss battles instead-Much effort and detail put into sound effects for every little thing. E.g., sound of barefeet stepping on wet rock as your character moves around a dark forest, or the metal tinkering sound of the crown when it hits the floorStory-Straight out of a fairytale, but with a slightly dark and gloomy atmosphere replacing the usual happy, uplifting mood found in these type of stories-Some nice plot twists and turn of events that match well with the sorrowful mood of the story, but otherwise, fairly straight forward like most fairytales-despite the generally sombre feeling of the story, still heartwarming at times-At its core, a coming-of-age story. People looking for something with an intricate and deep plot will be disappointedCharacters-With the plot being reminiscent of a disney movie, likewise the characters also follow suit (talking animals/ mythological creatures)-Charming/cute characters that compliment each other well due to their distinctive personalities and character traits-Main character (Aurora)  is an incredibly cute and sweet, but brave little girl. (Very likeable protagonist)Dialogue-Everything is spoken in rhymes; adds to the cuteness/fairytaleness of the story, but may become annoying for some people as the game progressesGameplay-Old school turn based combat with several added twists-Order of turns in combat dictated by a timeline mechanic, which is further influenced by an interruption mechanic when characters are attacked during the 'casting' part of the timeline-Timeline/interruption/cursor mechanic help add to the tension/unpredictability of fights and fosters strategic elements unique to these mechanics (e.g, knowing when it is worth using weak, but fast speed attacks to interrupt enemies VS straight brute force killing the monsters with strong but long cast time spells)-However, at its heart, it is still turn based battle, so it will not appeal to all people despite the previously mentioned mechanics that speed up the flow of battleRecommend to everyone but the most diehard haters of turn-based battle.Oh, and theres Uplay. ♥♥♥♥ Uplay. But seriously though, it's worth the hassel of installing and signing up for Uplay to experience this game. Cheers~			"

												okay here's the lowdown: this game has great visuals, a gorgeous soundtrack and functional characters/storyline, but good ♥♥♥♥ing LORD the gameplay is tedious, it's actually really peculiar because this game pulls an interesting twist on the traditional turn-based rpg combat system and implements a time bar that can be influenced to determine who strikes when, but the hindrance that catastrophises not only that glimmer of innovation but also tragically the rest of the game was how ♥♥♥♥ing monotonous and repetitive the gameplay was, the whole game circulates so reliantly on level grinding, which is a perfectly fine and definitely expected aspect to appear in an rpg, but not when you have to do it legitimately 85-90% of your time playing it. that's not an exaggeration, i've spent 18 hours on this game and i'm willing to bet 14 of them absolute minimum were dedicated to grinding. and i played it through on the easy difficulty too, god forbid anyone even attempts to grind through the hard difficulty because you won't be getting those hours back my friend. it's seriously such a shame that this one normally traversable issue in an rpg was so massive that it took away from the enjoyable facets into which there was obviously a lot of effort invested. i was going to recommend this game but, in spite of it's overall 6/10 score, from pretty much all angles it's just not worth it: it's too dull for the casual player, it's atrocious both in terms of mental stimulation and accessibility for a brand new player (the gems/items/lore system is poor and disorganised), it's not even that good for a hardcore player who spends their life grinding the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of games because the rest of the game simply becomes uninteresting indeed as a result of how much this game is composed of grinding. like all the ingredients are there to make a nice, simple, pleasant video game experience, but some ♥♥♥♥wit in development knocked over the entire jar labelled 'levelling up system' into the bowl and the end result just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that was probably the best joke i've ever made in my life. anyway don't play this game unless you're willing to go the distance, and i ♥♥♥♥ing mean really go the distance			"

												Ususally, I don't play turn-based games. I don't like that you have to wait a preordained period of time to be able to do something (where's my freedom to do whatever I want?!), so I bought this game on a whim. I liked the art mostly. It's cute. And it was on sale. So with my bias against turn-based games, I started playing it, thinking ˝Well, if I don't like it, at least I didn't spend that much on it˝. And to my surprise, I kept on playing it. I did not feel frustrated about the turn-based system, because this game's system is more dynamic (play the game or youtube it and you'll see what I mean). As with all turn-based games, the fights can become repetitive, but I found them to be engaging enough to not really care about it.I haven't finished the game yet, but so far I found the story to be quite engaging and well narrated. The rhymes add a taste of childhood, without being childish. The art is stunning and the soundtrack is well matched with the pacing of the game. Overall, this game was a very pleasant surprise for me.			"

												Not a bad little rpg, i originally was captured by the artstyle and continued to play on.It has a nice feel to flying and a lot of the fluidity feels like the honed gameplay from some of the recent rayman games. Infact i can imagine them just taking the straight rayman engine and loading it up with these cartoony/storybook assets.Anyway the game started out strong for me, an interesting story and art style and game mechanics but after a while those things get stale. Most puzzles involve using Igniculus to shine on some element or to project a shadow. I thought you might get other abilities other than flying but you don't. Then i also found myself skipping alot of the dialog which i rarely do in games, i think its just due to the fact its not straightforward chit chat.All in all though it was fun enough to push through, the other characters and pickups and parts of the story were intersting enough and i could see some different experiences happening between players if you don't seek out every single thing in the game.I can see a sequel or another game of a similar style really tightening up some of these aspects and making a much better rounded experience.

												Child of Light is one of the best recent rpg's I have played.  When I first thought about playing this game I had decided that I would rather watch it on youtube, which would have turned out to be a huge mistake.  Since it's an rpg you get a lot more choice in how you play over somebody elses experience.           I think the story of this game is pretty good but not amazing, as it's told in a fairy tale type manner.  Every character speaks in rhyme, so a lot of the time they have to select words and phrases that would rhyme with the last, instead of telling a rich story.  But that isn't to say there is no story because there definetely is.  The main character actually grows up throughout the story, like she starts off selfish but becomes selfless to the end, unfortunately thats it for character growth though, at the end of the day everybody is there for the main character.	The combat of this game is 99% of the team easy and excellent, and if you play the game on casual mode you won't have to fight half the enemies in the game, it's really easy.  It's only on expert that the game becomes a lot harder.  It's a turn based rpg where your character moves across on a bar at the bottom, which depends on your speed stat.  Your character will start at the wait part of the bar, which is basically waiting to select a skill.  Once you hit the end of wait you will hit a line where you can select a skill.  Each skill has a time that it takes to get off, depending on it's strength.  Now the mechanic of the combat that makes it somewhat strategic, is the fact that if the enemy hits you well you are in the red bar you will get interrupted, and pushed back on the bar so that you have to reselect your skill.  If you hit the enemy well they are in the red bar they will be knocked back and interrupted as well.  So you can really plan knocking back enemies judging by how fast they are on the bar.  Other than that you only can fight with 2 characters and  the enemies can have up to 3.  	What makes this a good game to play yourself is the skills that you get.  Now it isn't as in depth as a skill tree is, but it has enough depth so that you can choose what you want each character to do.  Each skill has two forms as well, the solo one which hits one enemy and the all version which hits all enemies.  The all version takes a lot longer to get off though.  Also if you play the game on the casual difficulty, not only can you avoid most fights to beat the game, you get more exp.  In the expert version you can finish the game at level 50 but on casual it's around 70.  	Expert difficulty also creates the importance of the crafting system where you actually have to use items and upgrades to survive.  There is a crafting system in the game called Oculli which isn't explained so much, but it isn't that convuluted that you wouldn't understand it with some practice.  The game also gives you a lot to use for crafting.  Basically they upgrade your strength in certain aspects.  Like the red Oculli gives your character fire damage and the blue one water damage.  They also give you defencive boosts, based on which Oculli is put where.	Overall I'd say this game is good, but don't expect the most immersive rpg mechanics or characterization, that other rpg's like final fantasy have.  This game took me about 14 hours to complete, but I did enjoy my experience.  And it was nice to be able to play an rpg that wasn't going to take me 100 plus hours to beat.  I'd recommend this game to people who want to play an rpg that isn't too hard or takes too much time to get into.  I also recommend playing this game on expert difficulty, which is the way it was meant to be played.			"

												From the start, I have been hooked on this game. The soft pastel look in terms of graphics, actually do a LOT to help the scenery in the game. Even the rhyming all the time is rather amusing, though I could see folks getting tired of it fast. This is in terms of function, and old school rpg, with a fight timer much like the grandia style games. The music also folds beautifully with the game, and each of the hand drawn {at least that's how they look} characters helps bring a smile to my face. Well worth the buy, if you find it on sale, you will kick yourself for missing this one if you are a fan of the RPG genre.			"

												Not a bad little rpg, i originally was captured by the artstyle and continued to play on.It has a nice feel to flying and a lot of the fluidity feels like the honed gameplay from some of the recent rayman games. Infact i can imagine them just taking the straight rayman engine and loading it up with these cartoony/storybook assets.Anyway the game started out strong for me, an interesting story and art style and game mechanics but after a while those things get stale. Most puzzles involve using Igniculus to shine on some element or to project a shadow. I thought you might get other abilities other than flying but you don't. Then i also found myself skipping alot of the dialog which i rarely do in games, i think its just due to the fact its not straightforward chit chat.All in all though it was fun enough to push through, the other characters and pickups and parts of the story were intersting enough and i could see some different experiences happening between players if you don't seek out every single thing in the game.I can see a sequel or another game of a similar style really tightening up some of these aspects and making a much better rounded experience.

												Ususally, I don't play turn-based games. I don't like that you have to wait a preordained period of time to be able to do something (where's my freedom to do whatever I want?!), so I bought this game on a whim. I liked the art mostly. It's cute. And it was on sale. So with my bias against turn-based games, I started playing it, thinking ˝Well, if I don't like it, at least I didn't spend that much on it˝. And to my surprise, I kept on playing it. I did not feel frustrated about the turn-based system, because this game's system is more dynamic (play the game or youtube it and you'll see what I mean). As with all turn-based games, the fights can become repetitive, but I found them to be engaging enough to not really care about it.I haven't finished the game yet, but so far I found the story to be quite engaging and well narrated. The rhymes add a taste of childhood, without being childish. The art is stunning and the soundtrack is well matched with the pacing of the game. Overall, this game was a very pleasant surprise for me.			"

												Child of Light is one of the best recent rpg's I have played.  When I first thought about playing this game I had decided that I would rather watch it on youtube, which would have turned out to be a huge mistake.

												This game just flat out awed me and filled me so full of nostalgic feelings for the RPGs I played on my Playstation when I was a young girl. What I love most was the battle system which was a slightly more dynamic version of the turn-based Active Time Battle system used in many older Final Fantasy games. The visuals are beautiful and the story is entertaining and poetic. I thoroughly enjoyed all the different party members and the game's plot. Literally, my only disappointment is I wish this game was longer, because I didn't want it to end so soon. Also, it requires Uplay, a client provided through Ubisoft. Based on other reviews, it appears to be finicky. But I didn't seem to experience any problems with it. Even after I had nearly stopped playing the game for a year and went back to play it again later, I incurred no serious issues with the Uplay service.If you're into RPGs you should definitely give this game a try. And if you're not too familiar with the style of RPGs, don't worry. This game is straight forward, easy to get into and quite intuitive when it comes to controls.			"

												The most enjoyable RPG I've played in a long time. Its mechanics are solid, easy to pick up and play, and never seem to leave me bored like so many other RPGs. Its a little on the light-weight side, but its design is very intuitive and to the point, but still presenting a challenge. It has checks and balances against ""min-maxing"", but that's often done simply. The progression system is also simple compared to older RPGs and some modern one (though much more advanced than, say, games like Final Fantasy 13 or World of Warcraft). The story is very nice and inspiring, very melancholy and darkly beautiful. Its like looking through the eyes of an innocent child at a destitute world; that's pretty much the theme throughout. Its more than the sum of its parts in the emotions which it evokes.Its a long-run RPG but ends abruptly, however it still manages to wrap things up nicely. As far as I can tell, there are no end-game quests, no ""ultimate weapons"" to be had, which I find somewhat disapointing. I know there's some things I haven't completed, but I'm not holding my breath for anything like, say Final Fantasy 8's endgame.All in all its a great game, and one of the best of its generation of games (Xbox 360 era till now).

												This game practically masters the ""Fable"" aesthetic; the story is engaging and is written with a verse-based whimsy that is infused with a depth unheard of in games of this tone. The 2.5D art design is out-of-this-world, and further strengthens the pedigree of the UbiArt engine. The sole issue hampering this game is the Final-Fantasy-style combat; while the strategy involved in timing hits is somewhat engaging, the sheer, samey repetitiveness of it, in addition to the lack of useful info on enemy stats, make the idea of playing on anything other than Casual untenable. 4/5			"

												okay here's the lowdown: this game has great visuals, a gorgeous soundtrack and functional characters/storyline, but good ♥♥♥♥ing LORD the gameplay is tedious, it's actually really peculiar because this game pulls an interesting twist on the traditional turn-based rpg combat system and implements a time bar that can be influenced to determine who strikes when, but the hindrance that catastrophises not only that glimmer of innovation but also tragically the rest of the game was how ♥♥♥♥ing monotonous and repetitive the gameplay was, the whole game circulates so reliantly on level grinding, which is a perfectly fine and definitely expected aspect to appear in an rpg, but not when you have to do it legitimately 85-90% of your time playing it. that's not an exaggeration, i've spent 18 hours on this game and i'm willing to bet 14 of them absolute minimum were dedicated to grinding. and i played it through on the easy difficulty too, god forbid anyone even attempts to grind through the hard difficulty because you won't be getting those hours back my friend. it's seriously such a shame that this one normally traversable issue in an rpg was so massive that it took away from the enjoyable facets into which there was obviously a lot of effort invested. i was going to recommend this game but, in spite of it's overall 6/10 score, from pretty much all angles it's just not worth it: it's too dull for the casual player, it's atrocious both in terms of mental stimulation and accessibility for a brand new player (the gems/items/lore system is poor and disorganised), it's not even that good for a hardcore player who spends their life grinding the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of games because the rest of the game simply becomes uninteresting indeed as a result of how much this game is composed of grinding. like all the ingredients are there to make a nice, simple, pleasant video game experience, but some ♥♥♥♥wit in development knocked over the entire jar labelled 'levelling up system' into the bowl and the end result just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that was probably the best joke i've ever made in my life. anyway don't play this game unless you're willing to go the distance, and i ♥♥♥♥ing mean really go the distance			"

												Warning: Indepth reviewVisuals-Gorgeous watercolor artstyle-Charming/cute fairytale-like character designs-Extremely beautiful and detailed environments and scenery aided by the artstyle-High attention to detail for character/skill animations. E.g, main character fumbles around a lot while wielding/using her sword because it is practically the same size as herAudio-Eargasmic fully orchestrated soundtracks-Music styles range from lighthearted disneylike bgm to intense, adrenaline pumping musical scores to sombre, lonely, melancholic pieces-Soundtracks that play during normal monster battles are so epic that they feel more like final boss battles instead-Much effort and detail put into sound effects for every little thing. E.g., sound of barefeet stepping on wet rock as your character moves around a dark forest, or the metal tinkering sound of the crown when it hits the floorStory-Straight out of a fairytale, but with a slightly dark and gloomy atmosphere replacing the usual happy, uplifting mood found in these type of stories-Some nice plot twists and turn of events that match well with the sorrowful mood of the story, but otherwise, fairly straight forward like most fairytales-despite the generally sombre feeling of the story, still heartwarming at times-At its core, a coming-of-age story. People looking for something with an intricate and deep plot will be disappointedCharacters-With the plot being reminiscent of a disney movie, likewise the characters also follow suit (talking animals/ mythological creatures)-Charming/cute characters that compliment each other well due to their distinctive personalities and character traits-Main character (Aurora)  is an incredibly cute and sweet, but brave little girl. (Very likeable protagonist)Dialogue-Everything is spoken in rhymes; adds to the cuteness/fairytaleness of the story, but may become annoying for some people as the game progressesGameplay-Old school turn based combat with several added twists-Order of turns in combat dictated by a timeline mechanic, which is further influenced by an interruption mechanic when characters are attacked during the 'casting' part of the timeline-Timeline/interruption/cursor mechanic help add to the tension/unpredictability of fights and fosters strategic elements unique to these mechanics (e.g, knowing when it is worth using weak, but fast speed attacks to interrupt enemies VS straight brute force killing the monsters with strong but long cast time spells)-However, at its heart, it is still turn based battle, so it will not appeal to all people despite the previously mentioned mechanics that speed up the flow of battleRecommend to everyone but the most diehard haters of turn-based battle.Oh, and theres Uplay. ♥♥♥♥ Uplay. But seriously though, it's worth the hassel of installing and signing up for Uplay to experience this game. Cheers~			"

												Simply put, if you're a fan of RPGs and enjoy quality platforming elements in games, this is a must buy. Absolutely gorgeous in multiple facets, Child of Light is a prime example of video games being works of art. It contains a coming of age story with a old ""storybook/picture book"" feel that adds a ton of charm. It's well worth the purchase price and if you can get it on sale, don't hesitate to pick this up!+ Gorgeous graphics+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Charming characters+ Pleasing storytelling+ Enjoyable turn based combat+ Entertaining platforming- Combat system isn't incredibly deep			"

												If you love videogames and fairytales then you should play Child of Light with no doubt. This is an AMAZING game. It's a classic RPG style with an awsome story, design and music. I love this game, it has everything I like and I could feel a lot of emotions through the gameplay, the battle style by turns and the choice of changing your partner it's pretty cool. The characters development it's sweet and the main story it's sad and beautiful at the same time. You should give it a try, I think anyone can enjoy playing Child of Light!			"

												Child of Light is probably the most beautiful game I've ever played.Just to get this clear most, if not all the negative reviews is because ''Uplay ruined this game'' just seriously, grow up! Ubisoft has made their decision and complaining and hating won't make them change it, so just live with it!Ok, back to the game.You're playing as the character Aurora, the Princess of Light who is trapped in a dream world. Your goal is to get back to your father because he's dying, but getting back won't be as easy as it sounds like. She has to fight multiple bosses, help people out and kill enemies. I love the graphics and gotta admit, Ubisoft really did a good job with this game!If you want a game that has a beautiful soundtrack, beautiful game play and the story... It just feels amazing to play. Just for the love of God, buy this game and don't mind the Uplay, I've completed this game 5 times (3 times w/o wifi so it looks like 2 times w/ my gameplay hours) and I gotta admit that I can't get tired of this game. 10/10 from me!

												On this review, I will be writing the pros and cons instead of just telling you how good the game is. I just wanted to say that this is an awesome RPG with beautiful graphics and with a great mix of platforming.ProsThis game has a sufficient amount of interesting enemies that love the dark, but want to kill you.You can upgrade your protaganist using the skill points you have earned through leveling up.You can distract enemies to avoid engaging in an RPG by shining your partner at them.You can equip a gem to your attacks, armor, or weapons to power them up or give them a buff.I love the hair flow physics it just makes the game feel more magical.Now let us talk about the bad parts of the game(Don't let this convince you into not getting the game if you were thinking about it).ConsYour character walks slow for a dramatic fantasy effect(that or my frame rates are low).The wait for executing your turn in the unique RPG battle system is just a hair bit long. It would probably be better if it was a bit shorter.Your partner can distract the enemies during an RPG battle during the waiting term, but loses stamina while doing that.In dark areas you need to not only light your partner up, but also move him throught the area as well.

												Child of Light is a 2D side scroller with stunning visuals,creative puzzles and simple RPG elements . This game will require Uplay account to start . I personally never had any problems with Uplay but some people do . If you not getting CD key , delet Uplay and install latest version (it should let you in without cd key)Please note that this game will not run well on integrated graphics unless you have at least low end card build into your computer . Requirments for this game are very low but not low enough to run it on Labtops that are build for internet browsing . The Story in this game is very generic as some people pointed out in negative reviews . All the plot twists are predictable but my eyes were tearing more than once. It is a same story about princess and stepmother you herd a million times but it does a good job of conveying emotions and setting the atmosphere . Granted you have to like kid stories to fully enjoy this game .Gameplay is a turn-based combat . It is like old over the top RPG games only in 2D side scroller. You have to run into enemies to start combat so its not in real time . If you played many RPGs I would recommend starting the game on expert mode or it might be too easy . Few boss fights kicked my booty so I had to grind few levels which reminds good old times .I spotted 2 big flawed design mistakes with gameplay . You will notice that enemies do not have any information regarding their resitances (some are color coded and the other are not ) I made a guide for that if you run into that problem .Also if you use AOE buffs they will only apply to 2 party members that are in the combat ( which is wird because after using a Buffing character you would want to switch to damage character so it defeats the purpose of AOE buff)There are 7 to 8 characters ( 9 with DLC ) that will be in your party . They all have their own skill trees with passive and active skills . You will need to strategically use each one to beat the game .Beside gameplay this game is very pretty  . You don't see many big companies do these kind of games and I have to say that Ubi deservs some praise on this one . I mean it looks like you playing inside the painting entire time .You can play this game with 2 players in a HotSeat . One will control Aurora and the other will control a little flying thing that can pick items , slow down enemies and heal party members .I don't have kids but if  you have 7-10 year olds maybe it will be a fun activity . This game is pretty much kid friendly .Overall I would give this game 9/10 for what it is . If you like RPGs,pretty side scrollers and kid's stories then it should be a fun experience .			"

												Wow... This is a really great game. Not good, great. It has all the mechanics that make a game interesting. You can find the Final Fantasy turn based combat when you first encounter combat, sadly you only use 2 companions at any time.PROS1. StorylineIt's amazing. It starts off with in 1895 Austria with the story of princess Aurora. Her mother is a duchess but died early. Aurora's father, the king, brings Aurora up on his own. Later on, he marries a dark woman as he is lonely. Conincidentally, Aurora catches a cold which causes her to get sick (I think it's pneumonia) and she dies.If you read on, the story delves deeper into the land of Lumeria and a find a deeper battle between Umbra and the light.2. Combination of Mechanics You have Igniculus, the ball of light which you can control with mouse or a 2-player controller. You use him to activate mechanisms, slow down enemies in combat and blind enemies.3. Combat SystemInitiative based system which is amazing. You even get to use Igniculus to slow enemies down.4. FlyingThat won the game for me. Instead of the double jump cliche, flying took the game to a whole new level. It expanded the possibilities of the game so much more. 5. Light PuzzlesPretty cool.6. Background and ForegroundAmazing. When I saw the giant moving in the background, it really made my day.7. Attention to DetailAurora's hair falls about when you jump and fall off ledges. It's beautiful. It's the little things like this that make the game amazing.8. Igniculus, the ElementalThe glowing orb is so useful, let me list the ways.a. Hints on your questsb. Collecting energy and health in combatc. Blinding enemies while travellingd. Slowing enemies while in combate. Activating mechanisms which require lightf. Picking up Confessionsg. Story buddyh. Healingi. Illumination9. The Bells in the Capilli VillageI love it. If you fly into the bells, the bells jingle.10. MusicThe piano accompaniement is so soothing and beautiful. Kudos to the composer.11. CharactersRubella - Jester HealerGolem - Ancient GolemFinn - Capelli MageNorah - Swift Fighter (Betrays you)Aurora - Leader UnitRobert - Mouse ArcherGem - SorceressOengus - FighterTristin - Better copy of RubellaCONS1. Contact Points between the FloorsBefore you get Flying, sometimes just up onto a second level is extremely difficult.2. DLCA lot of the game is DLC-based. But I'll let it slide because the game is amazing.3. 2 Character Combat2 is kind of a few. It would be better with 3.4. Repeated MonstersAlthough there are many uniques monsters, you will find repeats where monsters just change colour from green to red to blue to black. There is also a case of changing monsters from from a live version to a zombie version, but I like this one.Total number of uniques area. Boar manb. Ogrec. Spike dogd. Needle nose flyere. Ghost Horsef. Alligator guard (Has a Zombie version)g. Bird guardh. Spirit of Deathi. Leaf insectj. Centaur ArcherSUGGESTIONS1. Ailment ListCould you provide a hot tip to show what the ailments mean? I had to guess that paralyze was you could move on the action bar.2. Igniculusa. Distracting large and dangerous enemiesb. Uncovering hidden symbols which can't be seem unless illuminatedc. Getting eaten by a large beast.3. MultiplayerI'm actually wondering if you could split the heroes and Igniculus on an online battle. 4. More Monster Slots + Hero SlotsI would like to see a 3 v 7 battle. Like the 3 heroes being surrounded. Just like Final Fantasy.			"

												Child of Light.An exquisite game.The game delivers an amazing storyline paired with a beautiful soundtrack.The story had me from the beginning, very interested as I discovered the game was set in a (magnificent!) fairytale setting, until the end, as I defeated the final boss with some epic boss music. The story leaves nothing to desire. The dialogs fit perfectly with the universe, just like the small little sound effects.I'll have to admit too, Ubisoft Montréal did a great job at the art works. Just like Rayman Origins/Legends, the artsyle is amazing and leaves for some very beautiful sights. The handpainted-look perfectly fits in with the fairytale setting.The gameplay may not seem like a lot at first sight. In some way it's your average turn-based RPG. In another way, it's not. You can control a companion which not only helps you with puzzles, but also during battles. It perfectly adds in the amount of complexity it needed. Easy to learn, hard to master kind of thing. If you want to use it optimally, it would require some experience. During boss battles, decent control of this little companion is necessary if you want to survive.tldr: Nice little turn-based RPG, beautiful in story and graphics.			"

												Child of Light is a fantastic game with a fairytale aesthetic, using classic storybook tropes, but using them effectively enough to make them enjoyable. The mechanics of the game are clean, borrowing ideas from JRPGs like Final Fantasy, with turn-based combat that simultaneously has real-time elements, and other tools like crafting and skill trees.Yes, the ending is rushed, but it isn’t terrible; the plot elements would likely have remained the same had more time been afforded to the development team. But there are other games that rushed or less than ideal endings that are still considered classics, such as Obsidian’s Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2, or Bioware’s Mass Effect trilogy. Video games by their nature should be more focused on giving joy in the journey, and this is exactly what Child of Light does.			"

												Child of Light is a very atmospheric and pretty game. The art style is lovely and well animated (I simply adore Aurora's hair!) and each character quite different from the next. The musical pieces sound unique and fit the setting well.A few times you are asked to make a decision by starting or ignoring a quest, though the only way this will affect your game is the number of allies you have at your disposal.The ending came quite out of the blue and with no real build-up. To be honest I was quite disappointed with that, as I had expected for more to happen and the final boss to at least be a bit of a challenge, which was really not the case.Once you've beat it for the first time you have the option to start a ""New Game +"". This means that while you have to collect your allies from the start, you still get to keep your items, skill tree, level and confessions. The enemies are a bit harder too, but that's pretty much it, so there's no real re-play value in my opinion.I would also have loved for the dialogue to have a voice over option, but all in all it was still a very fun and captivating game.I did not and will not bother buying any of the DLCs as aside from a new character they bring nothing new to the table in regards to game play or story.=====================||                          |||| This is a Giveback Review! ||||                          ||===================== "

												Overall a nice game.I played through it on normal difficulty (there is also ""expert"").It is definitely a title worth trying if you are into rpg's, however there are some shortcomings.The game felt short, and although there was a nice build-up, the ending felt a very abrupt and a little anti-climactic. There are some really cool boss fights, but towards the end, they start to feel like they recycled the ideas.The fighting system was decent -- the interrupt timing system makes it so it isn't just mindless spamming attack (like many of the greatest rpg's unfortunately do). The mouse (faerie) clicking mechanic to heal allies/slow enemies was nice, again, perhaps they could've done more with it.The cast of characters are good, but I wish there was more synergy between them in battle; also I would've liked some more fluid combat to keep the pace rolling.The gem crafting system was nice, but there weren't enough gems to properly equip all your characters, so maybe they want to relook at that system, since it has potential. I never had to use a single item throughout the game.Beautiful art, good music (although also recycled). There is good potential here if they decide to do some sort of sequel or spiritual successor. The game was very good and could have been great.Worth getting (on sale), the Golem character dlc is skippable. You won't miss much. Although he is a good character, the game is well balanced without him and he feels like a little bit too much given how diverse the party becomes. Also his story/dialogue is somewhat forgettable (wise old sentry, strong body, but missing something inside, providing wisdom to characters about finding themselves... yep, not cliched at all).6-7/10			"

												Um RPG-lite lindo graficamente, com um estilo bem único. O ar de conto de fadas permeia tudo do início ao fim. A história não é muito profunda, e os diálogos às vezes soam meio forçados pra encaixar nas rimas (todas as falas são rimadas, pra manter o tom de uma fábula).Infelizmente o sistema de combate acaba sendo maçante, pois gira em torno de interromper ações inimigas e evitar que suas ações sejam interrompidas. Qualquer ação leva um tempo pra ser executada, e sofrer um ataque enquanto isso faz com que seja cancelada. O problema é que você controla apenas dois personagens, enquanto os inimigos costumam ser 3 - ou seja, não é incomum você passar um ou dois turnos apenas vendo seus personagens tentando agir e não conseguindo. Isso não torna o jogo difícil, apenas chatinho nas batalhas - ele é boa indicação pra um iniciante no gênero, pois o nível de dificuldade é bem leve - e ainda tem a opção de deixar os combates mais fáceis ainda jogando no modo Casual. Mas, se conseguir ignorar essa parte, não é um jogo ruim. Só deixou um pouco a desejar.			"

												""Beware the night, Child of Light.""One of the aesthetically vibrant, turn-based rpg game one can play. The complexity of gem crafting and proper turn exection may look simple yet its subtleness and the flow of the actual gameplay is astounding. Every place, dimension, and sceneries are a definite sight to behold. Most of its puzzles are simple and self-explanatory, however, the game makes up for its interesting style of battle sequence, becuase it forces you to take advantage of situation everytime you face an enemy. There are many ways of building your character. Ranging from skill trees to varieties of gem, the game easily reflects the result of how effective the builds are against enemies. So one should be mindful and carefully learn all the necessary factors because the game can be quite challenging even if it is in normal mode.Amazing graphics, unique yet complex battle mechanic, and great character development, what more a person can want? Therefore, this game is perfect for Final Fantasy lovers, players that are looking for a change of pace, and especially those that are obssessed in the quality of graphics (including me).P.S. 3 Princess Stones equipped to Aurora = OP			"

If you've played any version of a Final Fantasy game then you will be right at home with Child of Light's game play. Elemental damage/resistance, gem crafting to be slotted in equipment and basic skill trees all serve to give you some level of customization without becoming too complicated.The system and story all make for a beautiful and inspiring introduction to RPGs for a casual gamer or children.

												This game is beautiful, well written and hands down the best game purchase I've made in years. I read the reviews before purchasing it and the only negative thing I found was that people don't like Uplay. Do not let that stop you from buying this game. The storyline is poetry (literally) the combat system is party based (2 members) that you can swap out mid combat. There is an ability tree system with 3 trees per character as well as a gem socketing system for your attack, defense and utility slots. This game is amazing, hands down. I seriously found a diamond in the rough when I picked this game up. I really hope that they make more games simliar to this.			"

												This is probably the single most beautiful game I have ever played in my life! The only thing I have to say in critique is that I iwsh it was a longer game. I want more games like this one in my life, seriously. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a game with a elaborate and mysterious story, a gorgeous art style and dialogue (which is totally unique), and a wonderful soundtrack.			"

Great graphics, music, and gameplay, and really cheap too for just $15.00.			"

												Child of Light has an extraodinary and unique gameplay experience, but most noticeably is renowned for its beautiful arts, compelling storyline and euphoric music. I most definitely recommend this for the eyes who enjoy the pure beauty of genius water-coloured enviroments and tranquil soundtrack to indulge into, but also the exhilarating fights you face. Most definitely a 10/10 for me.			"

												This game is incredibly beautiful. The art, music and story are all inspiring.Game play involves a standard RPG style system. If you've played any version of a Final Fantasy game then you will be right at home with Child of Light's game play. Elemental damage/resistance, gem crafting to be slotted in equipment and basic skill trees all serve to give you some level of customization without becoming too complicated.The system and story all make for a beautiful and inspiring introduction to RPGs for a casual gamer or children. For everyone else, it is a calm meditation as one becomes lost in the beauty and travails of lost Lemuria.			"

												Altamente recomendable, visualmente impresionante y con una banda sonora envolvente. La jugabilidad es simple pero no por ello se hace pesado o aburrido.La dificultad no llega a ser un reto en el modo casual pero si lo suficiente para no sentir que no tienes que pensar los movimientos.Es un juego realmente no te arrepientes de comprar ya que se disfruta tanto en jugabilidad (Difiere sustancialmente de la mayoria de juegos actuales) como en historia, la cual si bien no da grandes giros, su universo, dialogos y personajes atrapan lo suficiente para mantenerte enganchado.Algo negativo a destacar es que debes instalar uplay por narices lo cual crea en primer lugar el doble sistema de logue y logros y por otra parte imposibilita compartir el juego con el sistema de Steam Family.Aparte es practicamente necesario jugar a nueva partida+ si quieres llegar a nivel máximo y conseguir varias de las mejores gemas, algo practicamente obligatorio para los fans de los RPG clásicos.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Highly recommended, visually stunning and a marvelous soundtrack. The gameplay is simple but not boring nor repetitive. The difficulty does not become a challenge in casual mode but is enough to feel you have to think about the plays. It's a game that really you won't regret to buy, because both gameplay (differs substantially from most current games) and history ( which is a common one but his universe, dialogues and characters attract enough to keep playing. ) is highly enjoyable.One negative part is that you must install Uplay, that first creates twice login and achievements systems (ubisoft and steam ofc) and otherwise its impossible to share the game with Steam Family. Moreover is necessary play new game + if you want to reach the highest level and get more of the best gems, and that is practically mandatory for classic RPG fans (or hardcore players XD).			"

												Its not Dark Souls; more of a thinking game that leans heavy on the story and animations, which are both beautiful.  The combat is interesting and complex as you have to think and act differently for each character.  It is a bit simple, but that isn't meant to be a bad thing.  Its more a cup of tea on a foggy morning type game then throw your head phones one.			"

												A good place to start for anyone new to the rpg genre. The game has wonderful imagery and the atmosphere is set well. The combat system is similar to the active time battle system in older final fantasy games, with a few twists. Also the game has a touch of 2d side scrolling as you explore the world you're in. The game isn't too short, but it is easy, so if you want a challenge with your RPG then stick the difficulty up to expert. Replay value comes in the form of a New Game + mode after you finish, which keeps your skills and Occuli from your save file, in return for harder opponents. In short for the price this is a really well made rpg, and if you're curious about the genre and whether you would like this give it a shot. As a major rpg fan, I can definitly recommend this title.			"

												Fantastic art and flavor with a good mix of classic RPG and Platformer elements.  The writing and storyline very much mimic that of folk tales and though sometimes the rhyming is a little too cute for my taste, it doesn't distract from the engaging plot.  The music perfectly complements the storytelling and can be both beautiful and light and eerily haunting. Stunning and unexpected visuals will periodically take your breath away as you explore the world of light and darkness,  Overall one of the best games I've played in a long time.			"

*This game requires Uplay third party downloaded.**I played this on another account, so my hours on Steam aren't accurate.* Level0ne Curator  Child of Light    Score Comments   Gameplay 7 The controls of Child of Light were fair but felt clunky as a platformer. Flying was fun until I had to navigate smaller spaces, in which I found I was often crashing the sides and hurting myself. I didn’t so much enjoy the battles, as they got a bit repetitive. It's a platformer with RPG stats, but I found I wasn't interested in the stats. Also the Oculli crafting system felt rushed with some chance buffs not that helpful in battle.   Story 8 I liked moments of the story, but wasn’t completely enthralled. I liked the idea of the story being told in a rhyme, but eventually I was cringing at it. Perhaps a better story could’ve been told without the nursery rhymes constricting it.   Graphics 10 I really enjoyed the graphics of Child of Light. I found it was beautiful to look at, and while flying around the art and environment was wonderful. It felt very much like a children’s storybook and the art style looked hand painted.   Audio 9.5 I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this game. The music here really set the mood at the appropriate moments. The sounds in the game were fitting and often guided/alerted me when I was begrudgingly entering battle.   Replayability 3 While it was a relatively fun game to play, I can’t see myself continuing to maximize my character’s stats/abilities any further, let alone replaying the game again. With a decent story and gameplay, I have no wishes to return to Lemuria.   Overall 7.5 Child of Light set me in a beautiful place called Lemuria. The music added to the tranquil beauty. But the controls felt awkward at times, though didn’t hinder me too much. I want to love the story, but unfortunately I couldn’t get passed the rhyming.

												I absolutely adore this game.The art style is simple, but very pretty.The poetry/rhyming in the game is quite interesting, and more times than not, funny.Art style is very watercolour like, and very vibrant.The characters are charming.Battle is very Final Fantasy style. It has an RPG feel to it, without it being 100% RPG like.The battle is turn-based, with each character's move taking a certain amount of time, and being hit within the ""casting"" zone, makes you reset to the start of the bar.One of my other favourite things of the game is the music. The music is very pretty and quite relaxing at times.Overall the game is amazing, and I think has quite the fair price for it.			"

The rhyimg seems a little strange at first, but it grew on me and I think it really gives the game character.

												A beautiful game that really shows how video games can do story telling differently than books, movies, and shows. The actual gameplay is sort of an evolution from classic turn-based RPGs (e.g. FF6) where you have 2 active characters at any given time but can swap characters out anytime it's your turn. On normal it didn't require a great deal of strategy to get through most fights (a couple were scary for sure even so), I imagine it's a bit brutal on the harder difficulty. It may seem short for a story-telling RPG but it really is just about a perfect length for itself. Highly recommend this game, goes up on the top-tier shelf and is another excellent example of how a game can both be fun and tell a story in a unique way. Also it's purty.5/5 fireflies			"

												Child of Light is pretty much the best thing to happen to RPG's since Final Fantasy VII (or VI, if that's your favorite).  Just buy it and play it... and then buy the soundtrack, because trust me, you'll want to.  I'll be adding this gem to the list of gaming experiences i will never ever forget.			"

												This game is adorable. I love the fairy tale art style. It's pretty. The gameplay is fun and relaxing. It's not too challenging. I died maybe twice on normal. I've not encountered any problems with using Uplay. It took me about 15 hours to complete with about 80% of everything to be found. If you like cute, rhymey-whimey puzzley platformey games that you can play through in a few sittings, I recommend. Very kid friendly game.			"

												Child of Light is a 10-15 hour game that incorporates elements of turn-based rpgs and platforming in order to weave a tale of fantasy and lost kingdoms.  Immediately striking is the use of water-color inspired backdrops and lighting effects. Each new area and set piece within the game was designed with the same level of care and detail that one would expect from traditional art. The soundtrack, as well as the tone of the storyline, invokes a strange sense of nostalgia for fairy tales and children’s books. Without divulging any spoilers, there are elements of the storyline that mirror tales by Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. And much like these authors tales there lays a certain air of darkness and sadness to the story narrative of Child of Light. Despite this, I consider the game to be suitable for kids. The gameplay element was both familiar and simplistic, however the use of the right analog stick to assist in puzzle solving added a bit of flavor and variety to the platforming. Battles were fought using a turn-based system, with the ability to slow or speed up a character or enemy along in the timeline. This allowed for interesting ""on-the-fly"" decisions that made the combat fun and allowed for a bit of strategy to be incorporated. XP is awarded after winning battles which can be used to develop a skill tree. Each character the player encounters in the game will have various ""specialty"" skills, and each may be switched out during combat. There is also a crafting feature in the game that will result in various gems that will ""buff"" certain skills in battle.Overall, the game was not very difficult. I found the puzzle solving to be a somewhat shallow, and even the combat, albeit seemingly deep within the first few hours, became mechanical and grinding towards the end. However, the overarching experience of Child of Light was satisfying and charming. The amount of work put into creating the fantastical and whimsical atmosphere of Child of Light is what will remain long after the game's conclusion. I would recommend this game. 8/10			"

												An immersive and beautiful game that would always remain as one of my favorites. With its impeccable artwork and illustrious plot/dialogue, Child of Light never fails to succeed in drawing me deeper into the world of Lemuria.Gameplay was interesting, simple and reminds one of the old school turn based Final Fantasy battle style. Although only 2 characters can be used at any one time, the mechanics are simple and really easy to understand.Furthermore, battles are surprisingly just as lively and beautiful as the game. Characters also level easily and there's absolutely no need to grind! (Unless you tend to skip battles actively!)Character development was done really well, and the repertoire of characters with their lively dialogues truly brings the game to life.For only $15, this game is honestly quite the steal! I am even willing to pay $30 for this treasure!Most importantly, the soundtrack is just so beautiful and in synchrony with the plot that as a casual gamer, I really took my time to listen in and enjoy the calming melodies the game has to offer. Definitely getting the entire soundtrack!  Highly recommend this to any casual gamers out there who wants to enjoy 11-13 hours of a beautifully drawn masterpiece and live out your conventional fairytale in Child of Light! C: P.S. I thought the trailer seemed kinda childish at first but the first hour of gameplay showed me how wrong I am to judge this game so quickly at face value, hope everyone out there enjoys this game! Have not tried the DLCs but will get around to it! "

												Wow, just beat this amazing game last night and it moved me so much as a person that I owe UbiArt a review.Right out of gate, I want to comment on Uplay. This game (as with other ubisoft games) requires the installation of Uplay, which is a game launcher that runs outside of steam. Every time you play it does make you log in to Uplay, and while some view this as the biggest annoyance in the world, I honestly don't mind Uplay and barely notice it anymore. Now that I have this covered I will break down the rest of the game in readable chunks.Menu Interface - 9 - I played the game with a controller pad, and found everything accessible, my only minor complaint is in the crafting screen where it can get frustrating to remove gems. Open World Interface - 10 - Playing outside of combat is a thing of beautiful and fluid experience, not once did I feel like Aurora or Igneous was not an extension of myself. Exploration and loot gathering is well paced, and still offers a challenge for those completionists out there. Puzzles and open world dangers offer complexity and can require fluid control, but did not frustrate me or deter my desire to explore. Engaging combat is controllable, and the few times I was ambushed by a well placed enemy it was honestly fun.Combat Interface - 9 - Turn based combat has a nostalgic grab for me personally, and I can say Child of Light does it right. The default combat speed gradually introduces you to the flow of combat, and once you feel you have it locked down you can up the speed for a more seamless experience with quicker progression. My only wish is that I could have a third party member on the board during combat. UbiArt made up for this by allowing on the fly member switching, but I still felt like combat would have been more dynamic with a third member on the board, that said the use of Igneous as support was executed beautifully.Story - 8 - The story of Aurora is enticing and tugged at my heart strings. Her journey through the fantastical world Lumaria expresses personal growth and paints vivid a picture of the pain involved with growing up. While Aurora’s story felt deep and heartfelt, I found myself wanting more depth behind the support characters in addition to their small side quests.Visuals - 10 - I took so many screenshots during my first playthrough I lost count. This game is a testament to how great side scrolling (semi 3D) games can look. Countless times I found myself saying how great the game looked out loud to myself, my girlfriend, or through social media. Audio - 9 - Visuals are important and most gamers put an emphasis on “graphics” as their point of reference to game quality. I am of the opinion that visuals and audio work hand in hand, and Child of Light uses its music to create an immersive atmosphere that compliments its visuals like a twin sibling. My only gripe is that some of the sound effects can get loud and in a few instances became slightly irritating to the point where I turned down the volume. Aside from this small pet peeve, I could not possibly express how touching and appropriate the music is, and has found a place in my playlists.   I could not be happier with my purchase of this game. I was excited to play it months ago, and it has surpassed every expectation I had. Any fan of RPG’s, music, art, and well told stories will enjoy what Child of light brings to the table. I hope this review helps any who are on the fence decide to give this game a shot, you will not be disappointed.  "

												I cannot recommend this game enough!  From the painted backdrops, to the poetic dialogue, to the characters large and small,  everything in this game is a hand-crafted work of love.  In addition, the exploration and combat are almost exactly like Grandia II, a game which I still consider one of the best, and of having the best combat system in an RPG I've yet to play.My only qualm about Child of Light is that the end comes about a bit abruptly.  As such, you may require a second playthrough to do all of the additional side quests, but that's not really a takeaway when the game is so beautiful and poignant.			"

												Child of Light. The story of a girl trying to find her way home, while fulfilling a destiny unbeknownst to her. That is the precipice of the story, as for the gameplay. Imagine South Park: Stick of Truth, but with a way larger skill tree and the ability to fly. Half the game is putting the beat down on deadly enemies, the other half is exploring the extensive world that this game offers. It's putting many AAA RPG games to shame. Between the story, incredible art style, the interesting RPG elements and the poetic conversation pieces, this game get's an 8 and a half/10. It would have been better had the DLC's been worthwhile and had it not gone through UPlay in order to play but all in all, one of my new favourite RPG's.			"

												Really liked this game.    It's beautiful, sometimes sad, sometimes cute... but it always flows, never grinds which is the key.    It's not long to finish, but it's priced very well for what it gives.  Other people like the combat.   Combat and the talent trees are easy to get the hang of it.   Crafting is a little more experiment and learn.   And put together there's a lot of choice.   On the other hand, the game is less challenging in terms of puzzles and combat if you're looking for that...it's pretty easy to never die.   But, this is really about moving and flowing through beautiful and changing scenery and characters and a tragic but still uplifting storyline (compared to the grindingly depressing ""Banner Saga"").     Plus your situation as Aurora is emotional and interesting and a fair bit different than the usual video game fare.			"

												I heard so many wonderful reviews of Child of Light, that I started to be sceptical, and I wanted to know if they were truly as good as everyone said. As I have been so severely let down by triple A titles lately, this seemed like a much needed break. I will sum up everything below in this sentence: Child of Light is the sumation of the genre of RPGs, and an experience I find *essential* to any gamers repitoire. This game started out slow, as many RPGs do, but I was swiftly entranced in what was going on, and suddenly I was 10 hours in and micromanaging my inventory as I panicked about the fact that it was suddenly 5am on a work day. As your party grows, alongside your powers, you may have difficulty deciding who to power up, who to play up, and who to bench, I know I did. I've just prior to writing this discovered a new game plus mode, which I will be devoting this next weekend to. Now I want to break down the game into parts.Graphics 5/5 Now I know this game had such a different style of graphics, but I have to say, it so acurately represents the style it brings, I can't not love it. The fact that I could actually feel accurate depth with the style, and on multiple occasions, that came into play.Story 5/5Yes, it has some of the basics of any RPG, good vs. evil, light vs. dark, and family matters. However, it plays it so well, and makes you care so much, that you get excited and upset, and as someone who not often pines for anything less than a hurt puppy, this is a major deal. Gameplay 3/5Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the gameplay. The combat in this game is one of my favorite features, with how smooth and dynamic it is, yet while being so simple. The only thing is, I know that I like, but I can see where others wouldn't. If you are not a traditional RPGer, and especially level grinder, you may have some rough spots. Overall score 9.1/10While exceedingly beautiful and excelling at exactly what it is, the game has a few faults for those not used to the idea of level grinding, and your finger might cramp a bit from using your firefly companion. However, I would reccomend this game to anyone willing to hear me out. "

												This game is a lot of things... but in a word: Delightful.I went in to this game expecting it to be an easy, story-driven game. After all, the poetic dialogue and beautiful artwork do a lot to give the impression of a casual, almost-childish game.What I did not expect was a refreshingly new (and actually somewhat difficult) combat system. Of all the RPGs I've played, the battle system in Child of Light is one of my favorites. Admittedly, the remaining RPG elements are simplified: Stats are gained solely through levels and stat-pumping items, and each character has 3 armor ""slots"" for various gems. The customization is a little limited in that respect, but I think that to be appropriate given the semi-casual nature of the game.Of course, there's an easy mode (which I do NOT recommend) for those who just want the story.tl;dr - Good artwork, music, nice spin on RPG gameplay, 4.5/5. Would recommend.			"

												Once again Ubisoft creates a breathtaking game filled with joy, teras, plot twist and a happy ending. Child of Light has made its way onto my personal favorites. It combines final fantasies turn based battle system and beautiful artwaork into an action packed adventure. This game is filled with tons of battles that make you rethink your party. I would recommend this to anyone.			"

												This game is so fun.I am not anywhere close to beating it, but I enjoy it immensely every time I turn it on.I have played it mcuh more than I have on record, I often play offline and I also played this game once before, on an Xbox One.The graphics are beautiful and that dialogue rhymes so it is very cute. Graphics are always an important part of gameplay for me and this game is like a pretty storybook come to life.The fighting is turn based so if you don't like that, you should probably look elsewhere, although it has a cool twist with a time bar showing when a character will attack and you can even inturupt enemies so they have to attack even later.My biggest complaint would be having to download UPlay to play it, it gave me a really difficult time when trying to play in offline mode.8/10			"

												This Fairytale RPG is both beautiful and addictive!  The gameplay is relaxing and rewarding, and the soundtrack and gorgeous watercolour art style are so captivating that it's really easy to lose yourself for hours in this game!  I find the combat system to be really fun--it's a combination between turn-based and real time combat, and I really didn't think it would be possible to successfully combine those styles.  This game also has co-op gameplay available, if someone is playing with you.  The other player can control the firefly with the mouse (or extra controller on consoles) and help out during combat, exploration and puzzle solving.  I think the co-op would be a lot of fun, but I haven't been able to try that out yet.  I did pick up some DLC for this game after playing it for about 10 hours.  I found myself enjoying it enough to warrant picking up some bonus content, and even with the extras, the price of this game is very reasonable!  I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone :)			"

												The TL;DR version - A good RPG, feels familiar with some new mechanics. Story is fun, art is nice, characters are good. Worth full price, DEFINITELY worth sale price. Get it. Good casual RPG.--I waited two years to purchase Child of Light, waiting for it to be on sale. Finally I got my hands on this highly praised game, not actually really knowing exactly what it was. I only knew it had a neat art style and only recently found out it was a turn based combat RPG.This game is surprisingly great. If you enjoy RPGs, I highly recommend it. Even at the full price of $14.99, it is well worth it. The mechanics are both familiar and new - a very refreshing touch. I don't want to give away too much, but it is a game that makes the turn based combat even more strategic than most games of the same genre. You can interrupt enemies or be interrupted yourself, and you can use your little Firefly companion to slow enemies or aid your allies in and out of fights. The music is fun, although for the most part you're listening to the same song over and over in different compositions. Thankfully the song is good, but I feel like I only walked away remembering the main song.Every character in your party serves a purpose. At first I felt like I was just playing favorites, but different characters are very good against different enemies and you'll have an opportunity to utilize all of them. The example I can best give is your healer - for the most part, you won't need one if you're playing strategically well enough. But when the boss battles come around and the fights are more drawn out, you best believe you'll need one. The characters are also all very diverse and interesting, and reasonably interesting. I wouldn't say they're terribly deep, but I have so far enjoyed them all. My only complaint is that you can only use two characters in a fight at a time, out of your roster of 5 or 6. What's nice is that everyone benefits from the experience, which is definitely a bummer in other RPGs. But I would definitely have enjoyed fighting with three characters out at once, even if the enemies were a little tougher. However, your team is easily rotatable during a fight (much like Final Fantasy X for those that are familiar). I would definitely give this game at least an 8 out of 10, maybe even a 9. I have yet to beat it, but wanted to give it a brief review part way through. I'll be sure to update this review once I finish the game.			"

												Storyline: 6/10It's interesting and evokes some feels, but it's not anything that would incite any intense emotions.Gameplay: 7/10The combat system is simplistic for those who don't want to think too much, but also quite in-depth for those who want to get down and dirty. Every character has his own niche and are all good in their own rights. They all have their individual skill trees that will increase their stats and unlock new abilities. There are also gems in the game that serve as equipment for your party members, and they can be combined into newer and stronger gems.Graphics: 7/10The background is pretty cool, drawn in a free flowing, paint brush style. There's nothing really super flashy or impressive in the characters and animations, but there are also very few eyesores.Content: 2/10This is the biggest selling point, or lack thereof. I personally finished the first playthrough of the game in about 15 hours, and this includes a moderate amount of grinding and looting (both can be skipped). The game is too easy; there are autosaves at literally everything you do, enter a door, beat an enemy, open a chest, etc etc. There are no penalties for death, if you can even manage that; one can heal up to full HP/MP at any point in the game with the help of Igniculus and wishes. There's also a new game+ option, but this is farily trivial, as it is easier than the first playthrough. XP gains are boosted, causing all characters to be fairly overleveled have most of the important skills when they are needed. After beating the second playthrough, the game doesn't get any harder, so trying to beat the game a third time will only result in one hitting most enemies along the way. I was pretty hyped to be able to max out all of the characters and gems (which is actually pretty time consuming), only to realize that there's nothing to use my powered up party members on.Overall, not recommended if you want a long term investment like an in-depth RPG. It was entertaining while it lasted though.			"

You really feel like you are in the story.Battlesystem works very well although it felt a bit repetitive from time to time but the bossfights were surprisingly difficult and made me forgive all the repetitive bits.Highly recommended if you are even a little bit into this kind of game and you can forgive the required usage of Uplay software (which in my opinion isn't really that big of a nuisance anymore nowadays that it used to be).

The story keep me in until I started getting towards the end, I was able to guess what was going to happen next, and the game play was just too boring.

												I honestly really enjoy this game. The beginning is a little annoying when you are getting used to the controls and the timing (everything seems to move in slow motion due to ""dream world"") but after a while its no problem. There are a ton of really awesome mechanics that make the game more fun and not a run of the mill turn based game. Combat has a timing element, with a window for ""casting"" (basically when your preparing your attack) and you can interupt enemies while they are casting which essentially skips them. You can slow down your enemies with your firefly companion so you can skip ahead of them. There are also attack types like in pokemon with light being strong against dark, water against fire, etc. that adds to the mix. Overall, for the price, I would say this game is really good. Something that gets old is the constant rhyming in dialogue, but thats just my opinion. It does not ruin the game, it just gets on my nerves. I would say the depth of story and the cool mechanics more than compensates for annoying dialogue. Overall I'd give it 8.5/10			"

												Child of Light is a family-friendly game that is written all in rhyme, designed to be played as 2-players side by side (so parents, maybe this is how you enjoy games with your kids rather than shooing them from the room so you can play Saint's Row - or worse, letting them stay in the room with you and play all your M-rated titles)At best, CoL is a beautiful combination of painting and poetry, which can teach young players some basic platforming and turn-based RPG elements, with a competent adult actually doing the playing, the little player 2 can enjoy the narrative and do a few things that are much needed, once they are shown the way. As an adult, playing it by yourself, will you enjoy it as much? Well, probably not, which isn't to say it's a bad game, after all, you will be able to see how much work has gone into making this game, and while it may be simple, well that's all the more credit to it, it's a smart design and it doesn't overcomplicate things.Just, do not, I repeat, do not, under any circumstances, buy oculi. I bought the entire bundle of them along with all the other micro-transacion DLC, but without really knowing why. I guess it's just something we're used to seeing from AAA game devs, and we've been letting them get away with it. (I bought the game and DLC on sale though, otherwise I wouldn't have had even a passing interest in this based on other peoples' reviews that all gripe about Uplay.)So what are oculi, then? Well, they are gems, that go into sockets on your weapons and armor, each having a small stat benefit, and they are craftable within 3 tiers. They drop in the game as well, so if you don't buy them, don't worry, you get them included in the game already, and for the price of a couple dollars for 3-4 of them, really, you can't let yourself get ripped off like that. It's not like you have to seek out the hardest difficulty setting, there is a casual mode, and really, that's the only way I think it should be played, so you can enjoy it for what it is, and put the evil ""Corporate Commander"" EA / Ubisoft, out of your mind.Pros:- Painted beautiful artifacts in the game, back to front - Simple, but logical puzzles and turn-based RPG combat- Gem crafting is straightforward (It's a good thing to have in the game, not a good thing to be nickle and dimed to death over)- The game's entirely written in poem, so while cheesy, it can produce entertainmentCons:- The Golem and other DLC are BEYOND DOUBT content that was supposed to already be in the game, but was gouged out to make more DLC microtransactions - Uplay can be invasive, especially if you don't have a bunch of Ubisoft games (I don't) and CoL will not launch from steam, so Uplay has to be running and you have to have an account - Some people reported bugs and lost save data from Uplay, I have not as yet had it happen to me.Final Verdict7/10 - The gameplay is solid, if simple. The creators of the game put a lot of time, effort and talent into producing this game, it's just such a shame that their work is tainted by the greedy actions of corporate cronies pulling at our pursestrings. TL:DRChild of Light good, Ubisoft bad.			"

												Graphics/artwork and music are all fantastic, and set the mood perfectly.  Unfortunately, the story is a bit too...plain?  You could argue that it was intended for a younger audience, but even then...the writers underestimate children's ability to understand more ""mature"" subject matter.  The result is a story that feels diluted, compared to the richness of the visuals.Gameplay starts off very slow & simple.  But once you get a couple chapters in, it picks up nicely.  The combat system is similar to Final Fantasy, but with two key twists thrown in.  First, if you attack a monster while it's in the red ""Cast"" portion of its timeline, you can interrupt it, setting it back to an earlier position.  And second, you (or a friend) can shine the firefly companion's light on one enemy to slow it down.  These two simple elements allow for a surprising amount of strategy, making it possible to chain-interrupt enemies rather than relying on passive defense.Over all, I'm having fun, and it's a nice change of pace from the many overly-shiny 3D games out there now.  It's not perfect, but I think it's definitely worth checking out.			"

												Surprise, surprise but my review have nothing to do with Uplay.The reason I'm downvoting this game is because of several bugs I encountered.1. Each dialog skips 3-4 lines. I'm reading one line, then I'm reading about something else entirely. I'm not playing the game for it's riveting combat, I'm playing it for the story and I'm missing all the dialogs.2. Background texture bug - appeared several times.3. The game freezes at the main menu and stopped me from exiting. Had to Ctrl + Alt + Del to close it.* P.S - I'm not a fan of Uplay. "

												***Note: Negative review is for rpg turn-based mechanics lover. If you are just looking for a light rpg experience with platform elements with beautiful gfx, certainly this game is for you. Otherwise for deep turn based mechanics rpg, better look elsewhere ***I would like to give thumbs up for Child of Light, also because I was really looking forward to play it.But as big turn-based rpgs fan, I really can't upvote it.Before I get flamed for my negative reviews: the game itself is not that bad, the graphic is just so amazing, the soundtrack beuatiful and enchanting. The story was also good enough so far.But if after 6 hours I don't feel any kind of addiction of going on, something is wrong.And the problems are the mechanics. The platform elements are ok, but the turn-based ones are definitely not enough and too much repetitive. I am playing in ""expert"" mode and everything got after 2-3 hours too boring and repetitive. I've nothing abount grinding (thing that is not really required in this game) when the story keeps pushing you to continue because you want to know more, but this is not the case - too long intervals between exploration and story continues. I never used an item except on the third boss (and I was plenty of pots). The creatures are too similar and predictable (weakness to element). And party of 2 persons (even if you can switch them) is  limiting too much the field choices. So far the only thing I did was casting a spell, melee attack with the other, and replace with healer as needed. I'm very sorry but I am going to abandon it for now. It's really a shame and an hard decision because the graphic is such a pleasure for the eyes. Shame.			"

												This REALLY is that time you want a 'MAYBE' option - I'm going with ""Not Recommended"" because of just 1 aspect of the game but it's an important one I think.The combat is awful - truly and utterly awful.  It's killing the game for me - I'm actively avoiding it as much as I can but sooner or later you have to do it and it's just so BORING.Enemies have no health bars so you've little idea what's going on without staring at flying damage numbers/messages to judge efficacy.  The timing system gets truly unfollowable once there are multiple players on either side and specials etc. are scarce and often ineffective.Worst thing is it just doesn't fit the rest of the game at all - it's a curiously static and lifeless thing in a game otherwise packed with joy and sparkle.Everything else is fine - story, graphics, sound, controls are work well  (the rhyming gets a bit grating but you can skip it without losing the jist of what's going on) but the combat isn't easily avoided - you'll probably spend more time doing it than anything else - and it really is tiresome.Maybe play it on easy to get the atmosphere and story and then move along eh?p.s. I see much wailing about uPlay and whilst I don't like launchers in launchers, it works fine for me so I can't really complain about it.			"

												I had heard pretty good things about Child of Light.  It looked pretty cool so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Well, the background artwork is quite nice, for sure, but the design and animation of the characters feels a bit sloppy (though I do like the flowing hair).  Besides that, I don't have much to complain about what it looks like.  The game itself, however, is not very interesting.  Even the puzzles are simple and somewhat repetitive, involving lighting up different objects in a pattern.  While flying around and collecting treasure and potions I forget to use can be mildly entertaining, the battles are a disappointment.  It works kind of like turn based strategy of sorts, where you can use your glowing firefly to slow down the opponents.  In other words, battles are about timing and luck.  Even though you get different characters and can work strategies out with the different styles, the main problem is that it is boring.  It is the same type of battle over and over and over again.  Fly around, fight new monsters, fly around, fight more monsters.  Also, I would have liked it if at least three characters could be placed in the battle at a time like the enemies are.  I want to like the game, but I really just can’t.  The fights are pretty long and simply a lot of repetition of trying to blast enemies with your most powerful spell while attempting to avoid becoming paralyzed.  It can take forever.  Lastly, this is more of a personal preference, but I did not like the dialog between characters that shows up quite often.  It does not add to the plot and the poetry feels hastily thrown together to find something, anything that rhymes.  It gets annoying, especially when a new character joins the team and then every single other character must introduce themselves to that one.  Overall, I think the game could have been much better if there were a few tweaks made to it, but as it stands, I’m not very impressed.  Also, Uplay is a hassle.			"

												DISSAPOINTING. Excuse the caps, but I thought it might ask for a bit of attention amongst the floods of positive reviews. The combat in this game is extremely repetitious, and very limited in terms of play styles. Despite having many characters available, you are only able to fight with two at any given time. The skills and simple trees are relatively uninspired, or should I say, extremely inspired by what has frequently been used in past RPG's. The visuals -while aesthetically o.k- really don't go far enough considering the financial backing of ubisoft. Using items/healing/skilling up is tedious with a non-user friendly one at a time character view, and the whole craft your own gems (which add stats/buffs) is equally as limited. You end up making the same ~5 gems over and over again but in higher concentrations (and stat bonuses). This game will pleasantly waste some of your hours, but it is probably not worth the asking price. That being said, it may be a more enjoyable game for a very young audience. I'm 24.			"

												After playing it for a couple of hours more I cannot recommend Child of Light. It's very dull gameplay and almost cringeworthy dedication to making up rhymes for every single line of dialogue, which not only breaks the immersion but also makes me roll my eyes way too hard, makes it a very mediacore experience. I could ignore the terrible idea of rhyming if the gameplay made up for it, but neither the exploration of the world, which is reduced to some simple puzzles and really dodgy 'platforming' (more like dodging obstacles in air really), nor the RPG-esque fighting really qualify this game as 'fun'. The fights drag on for longer than necessary and even the 'weaknesses' become meaningless: you attack a fire looking monster so you equip oculi for water attack and fire defence. But you realize when you enter a fight that it also has an earth and air buddy. Also the game plain lies to you - defending is supposed to prevent you from being interrupted the game says, and then happily introduces enemies who ignore defence and knock you back despite defending. At the same time the AI is pretty dumb, often not 'finishing off' characters with low health and instead going for the full health party member, which means you can't really leave low HP people as decoy either.So the gameplay is dull, how about the story?The characters are varied sure but it's easy to see more effort went into finding rhymes than into actually making the characters memorable. I can berely say anything about the people in my party and it seems like they talk a lot - yet except for terrible rhymes the dialogues contain little to none information. It takes a lot of talent to convey a story through rhymes and the writer here just plain failed in most cases.Also you can tell how desperate he or she was for rhyming when a child uses words like 'commerce'. Aurora uses words that don't fit into child's mouth. So yes, rhymes make the game lose the immersion factor.Overall it's a pretty looking experiment of a game that failed in delivering whatever it was they tried to do.			"

												Although this game had pleasant music and art, I had a hard time enjoying it due to its combat system and bland storyline. Though the dialogue's rhyming scheme was endearing, this wasn't enough to make me care any more for the characters themselves or what they were doing. It feels like alot of effort was put into how battles flow, but I felt it was more like a chore the further I got into the game, between constantly switching characters on and off and reworking and managing oculi, the game's equipment socket system (materia). If that's your thing, great. Just not something I felt like pursuing anymore.			"

												My wife and I selected this game,because it offered a co-op campaign.we loved the art, right from the start,'til the last monster was slain-------------------------------------------------------------I'm reviewing this from the perspective of someone who played as the secondary character while my wife controlled the main player through our 15 hour campaign. Right away I want to applaud the game developers for creating an interesting co-op mechanic. The main player in solo play could just control the secondary role themselves (in fact they still can while another person is plugged in), if you are able to multitask and be effective it pays off to control the sprite character during hard battles. Giving the second player the role of this sprite splits the responsibility so that you don't have to consider as many options during fights, but you will still want to coordinate with the other player to perfect your timing.It's obvious that this game is uniquely beautiful. Ubisoft came up with a graphics engine that does a great job representing the mythical storied universe that the game takes place in. It's like someone added a physics engine to a children's book watercolor drawing. The story is told in the form of a poem, which is fun in spirit, but it's not always executed as well as I would have hoped. Otherwise, this is a very solid RPG game with great controller and co-op support.4/5			"

												In terms of story and gameplay, Child of Light is simplistic when compared to most RPGs. The story is nice, but it isn't very deep. Gameplay -- linear, not open -- is roundly functional and the controls are straightforward and highly intuitive even though the menu-driven inventory system may leave a little something to be desired. The battle system is challenging and paced well, but also a touch formulaic (I suppose that's part of the genre; I have never been an enthusiast of turn-based combat, so perhaps I'm not the one to ask about that).Here the focus was clearly on art, and it paid off. For the price, it is worth getting this game just to see it. The art style, reminiscent of the fairy tale illustrations of Ivan Bilbin, is astounding in imagination and execution. It is *the prettiest* game I have ever seen, as far as that goes.  The only major drawback, annoying enough for me almost not to recommend it to the community, is the godforsaken U-Play DRM from Ubisoft which you must be connected to in order to play. I haven't had any technical problems with it, but I hate invasive DRM of that nature, and this feature seems to be the focus of an awful lot of negative reviews. I do wish the character dialogue were on par with the game art; clearly it is not. The characters speak in rhyming verse, which adds to the storybook flavor of the game, but it is...well...just not very *good* verse. The dialogue isn't bad, so to speak, it just matches neither the tone nor the quality of the art. They hired serious artists to craft the visuals; if they wanted to use poetry, why wouldn't they hire serious poets? I'm sure lots of great poets out there could use the income. Overall, though, this is a highly enjoyable gaming experience on the lighter side of the RPG niche, and I'd gladly recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of game flavor. Kudos on the female protagonist, too.			"

It's a charming adventure, and a very welcome breath of fresh air in my steam library.

												Child of Light is a fairy tale about Aurora, the princess of Austria (?). Falled into a fantasy world, she lives an adventure to save her family and her people, and she also discovers her own marvellous destiny. The visual design reminds of old child book illustrations; it is beautiful, although sometimes silly and mushy (...why girls' hair are always horizontal, moved by an omnipresent wind lol?) ...the story and the character design (thanks to the quests she takes, Aurora meets many original characters) are well conceived, also some unexpected plot twists are present. Rpg features are reduced to quests and characters modification via trees of abilities, but do not expect visible customization or complex character study: you may choose random evolutions and they will equally functions. The turn-based combat system with the action timeline is generally easy, but also smart and it requires a good amount of reasoning and resources management. A positive note about the music, that will remain in your mind. Another curios aspect of the game are the dialogues and narration... all of them are in rhymes. That's cute but... at least in the italian version, no metrics are provided by the authors; for this reason, some sentences just sound contrived and stupid. Such as... not fairy/inspiring characters, but childish idiots who force their own speaking to put rhymes in it at any cost. The idea is cool Ubisoft, but if this is the goal... next time, please hire an experienced poet!vote 7.5/10			"

												A beautiful story portrayed through vivid poetry and an art style that oddly attracts, Child of Light is a great game. I don't know what compelled me to buy this game in the first place - I rarely buy steam games, but I have not a single regret about this. The main quest is lovely, the sidequests give you information that would make you crave more, and the confessions are amazing. Cunning language and a band of misfits that join your adventure as Aurora make for comedic relief, strong emotions, and an interesting backstory deploy more and more often. I would recommend this for anyone who likes a single player game with a strong sense of emotions and writing.			"

												It's pretty relaxing to play.  Nice writing, great music, and fantastic artwork.  The fighting is pretty good too and isn't something I've seen exactly done before.  It's turn based, but also relies on speed and the specific action you use on your turn.  That also changes if your opponent jumps in front of you on this meter that shows when you can use an action.  In the fighting scenes though, it's fixed and free flow.  You can still control your little light buddy to slow enemies speed on your cast bar on the bottom and to pick up HP and MP replenishers. There are skill trees which are pretty familiar, except that you kind of start in the middle and branch off in three different directions.  It really is a great game and I think it should have done a little better on the metascore.			"

The way it looks is amazing and the details make it look surreal. Not too mention the soundtracks are beautiful! Nice puzzels aswell ( But idc really) Tough the ability too fly makes it possible too skip almost 90% of the fights, wouldn't recommend it though. Getting lost in the maps and doors sometimes not showing up can be an issue.Giving it a 9/10, it's definitly worth the money			"

												Child of Light is something which is, in my books, damn near to perfection. You could floss with the difference. It looks beautiful, plays well, it is full of great and wonderful ideas (Igniculus for the win, just wait until you see), great fight mechanics (I say this even though plenty of expletives were said), and enchanting landscapes. It is the perfect fairy tale game. I have vanquished the evil in about seventeen hours, but it was an extraordinary experience (also, it felt shorter).			"

												This game, it is beautiful. The art, the sound, the music! It makes one's heart skip a beat. Challenging, it may not be, but a story it weaves with music to help guide the way. The writing is mostly solid and is delivered in rhymes. Almost all of it, but when it's not, it's done for good reason.If you enjoy RPGs and good stories told, I urge you to pick up Child of Light. I found it best played with a controller and solid headphones. Don't rush it, explore the world and enjoy. The game's not too difficult and you could beat it round 12 hours (or less). I don't recommend the DLC as it's cheating, at best. The Golem's Plight pack is the only one I'd advise, and even then, think about it before you decide.			"

												One of the most beautiful games I've seen since Okami on the Playstation 2.  The watercolor environments remind me of the classic artwork found in old fairytale books.  This is more of a casual feel RPG in that, there isn't a need to rush through anything.  Unlike many other RPGs out there where the hero uncovers a plot of world domination by a dastardly villain, Child of Light doesn't have that feeling of impending doom.  Even the music, beautifully orchestrated (and sometimes feel super epic), doesn't have that urgency to get from point A to point B.The highlight of this game, as many people will tell you, is the combat system.  It's almost a throwback to the active time battles as in Final Fantasy VII.  Where the combat commands seem overly simplistic in the beginning, it gets more complex as the hero levels up.  Timing is everything.  Literally.  In later stages of the game, if one isn't careful, enemies might force the player to constantly be on the defense, which will deplete the store of potions.The skill up menu also reminds me of the sphere grid a la Final Fantasy X, which was one of my favorite skill up ideas. All in all, Child of Light is a gorgeous game and definitely worth a playthrough.  I have to thank my friend for gifting this to me as a birthday present.			"

												7/10The artwork does not let up. Consistently beautiful throughout the game.Game gets grindy at some point, which is really bleh, but what can ya do about it? Child of Light is basically a JRPG with a unique ""overworld"" and a rich and charming environment. One, I should add, that really does require you to take full advantage of elemental strengths, resistances, and elemental boosting items. It's got a unique battle timer, which should keep you thinking about your next move.The story drags on, which was surprising for a game that really seemed to rely on it. But eh, was satisfying in the end anyway. Not a good sign when you're thinking to yourself, ""Glad to be finally over that damn hump.""			"

""Child - tuck yourself in bed.Let me tell a story of Lemuria,The kingdom past,And a girl born for glory.""If you aren't instantly captivated by the truely beautiful watercolour artwork; the wonderful, peaceful background music; or the soft motherly voice that narrates cutscenes throughout the game in just the trailer - then the carefully crafted and moving storyline behind a young princesss, Aurora, as she tries to reclaim her kingdom of Lemuria and return home to save her people from a disastrous flood certainly will.Gameplay:Two dimensional platformer with stunning parallax graphics. Easy to move around at a decent rate, especially once you unlock the ability to fly (which is fairly early on). All text within this game is in some form of poem, usually a rhyme. This game involves a little problem solving, many secret areas  and a ton of fun. The game uses powerful stones called Oculi to provide aditional effects to a characters health, defense and offense which are customisable for all party members at any time except during battle and cutscenes. There are eleven different oculi with their own individual effect depending on where they are applied; nine of which have four tiers of power at varying levels. (Eren's Stone can only be accessed through the purchase of a DLC and the Princess Stone is the most powerful of all and can be crafted with a Brilliant (tier 4) Diamond, Onyx and Spinel.) There are about 52 individual crafting recipies (most are repetitive among different tiers of oculi). One can also acquire and use Stardusts for permanent effects to a character's statistics. Local co-op and controller support.Combat:Combat is turn-based... with a twist. It involves a timeline. Depending on the character's speed, they move down the timeline at different rates (this can be effected by spells, potions or Igniculus - her first companion, controlled by mouse if you are using a keyboard; also known as 'Sir Firefly'). Upon reaching the begining of the casting region near the end, a spell, potion, defense or attack can be chosen (or you can switch party members) with a length of either instant, short, medium, long or very long casting time; which is cast if the character reaches the end of the timeline without being interrupted. Although it is fairly easy to guess based on the colour of the enemy: it doesn't actually tell you what you are fighting nor what element it is. Fire(red) magic/creatures are weak to Water(blue); Water to Lightning(green); Lightning to Fire; and Dark(Varies - usually black, occasionally white) to Light. Fairly easy to level up the same old classic RPG style with several different skill trees for each party member all leading to different  or more powerful abilities.Storyline:Although the storyline is good, it's not particulary in-depth. There are many mysterious clues that are seemingly never properly explained. It's a very straight storyline, with no user input and nothing to do after the game is completed. There are several sidequests, most very short and easy to do that lead to extra treasure. To be entirely honest though; although I like the freedom of choice, this game has been made with such precision and care that I don't even mind.I would definitely recommend this game. It has become one of my all-time-favourites. Sadly, I have finished it now however I enjoyed it so much that I will likely return to play it again several times over in the following years. Personally, the biggest disappointment for me is that there are no Steam cards, badges, achievements, emoticons or really awesome artwork that I can use as my Steam profile background (the latter being my biggest grievance).""Beware the night, Child of Light.""

												Gamplay: Standard RPG combat with an addition of an interrupt and slow system that is easy to use but would take some time to master. Outside of combat is standard 2D rpg format that works well with the flight mechanics. Animations, espcially Aurora's, are very nice and well done. Each characters has there own skill tree that has some customization, but not very complicated.Controls:I used a keyboard & Mouse.  Controls were simple and easy to use. In battle they are simplified to an active battle system which is easy to navigate. Outside of combat is a very simplistic platformer that does not require much precision. To Control your firefly you use your mouse, this is designed for a mouse, it works very well. With all that said, I believe the standard controls would also work very well with a control & the firefly mechanic would work well with the second joystick on all controllers. Overall- Very Good. Sound:  Beautiful music that fits the mood all the time, and sound effects fit extremly well with all the Spell effects Graphics:Atmospheres are beautifully designed, some of them are downright stunning, from dark & scary forests to Lava filled Trees to underwater caves from beginning to end. Not hard to see what ubisoft focused on while creating this game.Wothey Notes: The writing is pretty atrocious, the rhymes seemed very forced and weren't thought to hard about, character deveolpment is lack luster as well but you get the basic points . Only really complaint about this 12 hour RPG. Well worth the money, 8.0 out of 10.  "

												Child Of Light is a beautiful game. Visuals:The art is in watercolours which is very calming to look at and this game is not demanding so I could play this on my laptop if I wanted to, Gameplay:The Gameplay requires thinking. I found the difficultly to be good. You can get multiple party members which you can switch out in combat. All enemies have a weakness to an element (light, lightening, fire, etc). There is a timeline at the bottom of the screen which determines whos turn it is, you can slow enemies down or even paralyze them from reaching their turn and they can do the same to you. Story: The story is quite simple and is told in rhymes. Not everyone will like this. I personally liked it, it made me feel like I was listening to a bedtime story or a fairy tale. Don't expect a deep story or a heavy impact and don't expect any deep character development. Like I said the story is simple. Audio:Simply lovely, especially when Aurora plays her flute. The music and the visual style is very calming in this game. I would certainly recommend  this game to any RPG and Turn-based fan or people that like fairy tales.			"

												Not typically the kind of game I’d normally go for, but hands down one of the most amazing games I have ever played.  Very beautiful and a great story.  I did find the rhyming annoying at first, but then started to enjoy it – especially when taking into consideration the writing to keep the story consistent and still rhyme.  :-)I haven’t finished it yet, but it’s definitely a game I needed to play (feel good and a great pick-me up for those down in the dump kind of days).Looking forward to completing the game.

												I don't think there are words that can describe how I feel about this game. I have not made it very far into the game but they do so much to draw you in. The visuals and art design are breathtaking and mesmerizing. Ubi Art did an amazing job with this game  of pulling you in to the dark, mysterious yet beautiful landscape and environment. The music and sound design sends chills up and down my body. From the sound of Aurora's sword hitting an enemy to hearing a giant walk in the distance, you will always find something to be amazed at. The gameplay is very solid as well. Child of Light does a great job of combining RPG elements with little changes that make it both easy-to-understand yet challenging when it needs to be. I am playing on Hard and even simple skirmishes have me thinking about my next move. All in all, the real grab about this game is that it is only $15 at the time of this writing and it was DEFINITELY worth the money. RPG fans will not be disappointed and Adventure fans will find a new and enchanting world to explore with Aurora. I hope to see more amazing products like Child of Light in the future from Ubisoft. If I run into anything as I play more of the game that makes me change my review, I will update this accordingly.			"

												It's an amazing game. The overall flow is really great, the difficulty is perfect and the whole progression of the game feels really nice. I absolutely LOVE the soundtrack by Coeur de Pirate, it's definitely different from what she usually writes, but it still has the RPG feel in it. The graphics are really beautiful and breath-taking.The game only got one problem, though.And it's Uplay. You probably all saw that coming.Yet I love Ubisoft and I like their games since I'm a little kid, but come on. Ubisoft. Uplay again, really? I know you guys want your own DRM thing, but I just can't get over the fact that NOBODY likes Uplay! I even have some friends who pirated the game instead of buying it JUST BECAUSE OF UPLAY! And I understand them. It's really annoying when I have to have to wait 10 minutes everytime I want to play, just because of Uplay loading and saying:""Getting Proxy...""I just want to play the damn game.Anyhoo, great game. Would recommend to everybody who's looking for a good RPG.			"

												I absolutely recommend this game. I didn't know I needed a rhyming RPG, but now I do. This is a well-crafted, beautifully illustrated storybook wrapped in the guise of a game.Pro:Gorgeous presentation - like interacting with a paintingEngaging battle system - easy to grasp, but provides some challenge on harder levelsRhyming - brilliantly adds charm / whimsy and enhances the visual presentationCon:""Normal"" is too easy. I played briefly on normal before restarting on ""hard"". I suggest doing this unless you're really after a casual experience.Sometimes the rhyming is a stretch. Personally, even when the rhymes stretched, they made me smile. This is not a big con for me.Meh:The crafting system did not impress me, nor did I hate it. I mostly used the gems to speed up my own characters or give elemental damage.Overall, a lovely game. Some people said it was short. That may be. I didn't rush through everything, and it lasted me around 18 hours. That's a pretty good deal for $15. The only better deals I've had are for giant open-world RPGs like Skyrim or 4x games like Civ (I, II, III, IV, V, yes, I've played them all except Call to Power and Alpha Centauri).			"

												Just to say that I had never heard of this game until i saw it on steam and it pulled me in with the artwork alone. It's like an interactive pop-out story book. With all the characters, environments, and creatures as a normal rpg. but i started playing is where it really got good. 1) The characters talk like in ryhme, as if they are write a poem, and i don't know about you, but i love me some poetry. 2) The story is magnificent, its a well thought out and beautifully written masterpiece that pulls you in like a story you would be read to you by a parent as you fall asleep as a child, yet it is dark and intruiging like a story you would read and fall in love with now-a-days. 3) The characters are all dynamic and have their own strengths and faults laid out on the table for you to see. There aren't any characters that are ""cookie cut"" in my opinion, you connect and feel with all the characters (even some NPC's) even if you dont fight with all of them. and 4) The battle system is amazing! It's a timebar-type battle system THAT YOU CAN MANIPULATE. You use your mouse to slow down enemies or slowly heal allies, and to me adds a whole new level to the word ""STRATEGY"". The only cons i can see about this game is, 1) having to connect with uplay through steam is weird and a little inconvenient, but doesn't really bother after the inital set-up. and 2) although i do love the battle system, after awhile of fighting the same mobs over and over, it does get kind of tedious. But I mean all you have to do is skip monsters after awhile so it's easily avoidable.9.5/10 a great game for people of all ages			"

												7/10The artwork does not let up. Consistently beautiful throughout the game.Game gets grindy at some point, which is really bleh, but what can ya do about it? Child of Light is basically a JRPG with a unique ""overworld"" and a rich and charming environment. One, I should add, that really does require you to take full advantage of elemental strengths, resistances, and elemental boosting items. It's got a unique battle timer, which should keep you thinking about your next move.The story drags on, which was surprising for a game that really seemed to rely on it. But eh, was satisfying in the end anyway. Not a good sign when you're thinking to yourself, ""Glad to be finally over that damn hump.""			"

""Child - tuck yourself in bed.Let me tell a story of Lemuria,The kingdom past,And a girl born for glory.""If you aren't instantly captivated by the truely beautiful watercolour artwork; the wonderful, peaceful background music; or the soft motherly voice that narrates cutscenes throughout the game in just the trailer - then the carefully crafted and moving storyline behind a young princesss, Aurora, as she tries to reclaim her kingdom of Lemuria and return home to save her people from a disastrous flood certainly will.Gameplay:Two dimensional platformer with stunning parallax graphics. Easy to move around at a decent rate, especially once you unlock the ability to fly (which is fairly early on). All text within this game is in some form of poem, usually a rhyme. This game involves a little problem solving, many secret areas  and a ton of fun. The game uses powerful stones called Oculi to provide aditional effects to a characters health, defense and offense which are customisable for all party members at any time except during battle and cutscenes. There are eleven different oculi with their own individual effect depending on where they are applied; nine of which have four tiers of power at varying levels. (Eren's Stone can only be accessed through the purchase of a DLC and the Princess Stone is the most powerful of all and can be crafted with a Brilliant (tier 4) Diamond, Onyx and Spinel.) There are about 52 individual crafting recipies (most are repetitive among different tiers of oculi). One can also acquire and use Stardusts for permanent effects to a character's statistics. Local co-op and controller support.Combat:Combat is turn-based... with a twist. It involves a timeline. Depending on the character's speed, they move down the timeline at different rates (this can be effected by spells, potions or Igniculus - her first companion, controlled by mouse if you are using a keyboard; also known as 'Sir Firefly'). Upon reaching the begining of the casting region near the end, a spell, potion, defense or attack can be chosen (or you can switch party members) with a length of either instant, short, medium, long or very long casting time; which is cast if the character reaches the end of the timeline without being interrupted. Although it is fairly easy to guess based on the colour of the enemy: it doesn't actually tell you what you are fighting nor what element it is. Fire(red) magic/creatures are weak to Water(blue); Water to Lightning(green); Lightning to Fire; and Dark(Varies - usually black, occasionally white) to Light. Fairly easy to level up the same old classic RPG style with several different skill trees for each party member all leading to different  or more powerful abilities.Storyline:Although the storyline is good, it's not particulary in-depth. There are many mysterious clues that are seemingly never properly explained. It's a very straight storyline, with no user input and nothing to do after the game is completed. There are several sidequests, most very short and easy to do that lead to extra treasure. To be entirely honest though; although I like the freedom of choice, this game has been made with such precision and care that I don't even mind.I would definitely recommend this game. It has become one of my all-time-favourites. Sadly, I have finished it now however I enjoyed it so much that I will likely return to play it again several times over in the following years. Personally, the biggest disappointment for me is that there are no Steam cards, badges, achievements, emoticons or really awesome artwork that I can use as my Steam profile background (the latter being my biggest grievance).""Beware the night, Child of Light.""

												One of those most creative games I've played to date. Excellent art, fluidic and free movement, a wonderful RPG battle system that is similar to the Grandia series. I've always felt out of most rpgs Grandia's battle system was the most interesting to repeat over and over. And here they've given it new life with some twists. And if nothing else, the music is so well done that I'd play it just for that. A++++!			"

												First of all this is my first review and english is not my native language so sorry for either gramatical errors or typos and maybe bad format .TL;DR versionGraphics 10/10       Stunning . Even if they arent to your taste you cant deny how beautifull they areSound 8/10             Nice . it folows the game nothing extraordinary nothing annoyingMusic 10/10            Stunning . Just hear it Story 9/10               Nice . Simple fairy tale but that is the beauty of itCharacters 9/10      Nice . Every NPC has flaws , motivation and they are different persons with no stereotypesCombat 7/10           Good but can be boring fast Replayability 2/10  Unless you enjoy the game so much ,if you play it once and do all the quests or gather all confessions                                       .                                there is little reason to play it againOverall 9/10             A piece of art .Long version I saw this game when it first came out , and i said oh well lets fly the jolly roger. Then after i finished it , i just went and bought it . My experience was so good and felt those weird thingies called emotions that actually i shed a tear (meaning i had to literally wipe my eyes.. those onion-cutting ninjas). The selling points of this game are the atmosphere and the plot. But i will explain all of it belowChild of Light is tagged as a RPG , but offers you no choices in the plot element. But (and it is a big but) offers character customization (talents and occuli) and the most important thing character development . For me RPGs should be like that. You see as the time passes that Aurora and her companions grow up emotionally and stand up to the task . AtmosphereThe thing that made me play this game was the atmosphere . Graphics , dialogues , music are all so immersive that after 12 hours of playing i realized it was morning and i should tuck myself in bed and let the game and complete it later. Graphics arent realistic . Instead they follow a fantasy and are dreamlike , but that doesnt stop them for being stunning and once in a while you stop to enjoy the view . Music is a nice background which not only doesnt bother you but you like to hear it .. i cant find the words how well the soundtrack accompanies the game.Dialogues are in verse , meaning they are poems. They are fun , yet you understand the characters and their motivations and you want to help em .  I always like the dialogeus and read them through but at times speaking in verse can be overwhelming .Before  saying anything about the story i must say that this is a game which a child of 8 years can play . There is no blood , no cursing , a little jump scaring (you can always scout with the firefly) , and a simple plot(thougt simple doesnt mean not beautiful)Story . You are a princess of Austria and somehow you wake up in the middle of a dark scary forest away from your papa . Also you mist find the moon and the stars and defeat the evil queen umbra. How the hell a little child will do this ? . Of course with the help of the forest lady , Indignicus , and your companions ! each one has his/her own story and motivation and flaws . As the game goes on Aurora will grow up (changing her model) and finally will be an adult. Aurora is not either a warrior or a wizard... she is just a princess ... how you play is up to you. And that is another thing i love about this game.Playstyle Combat Well things are simple... you see the timebar , you see when everyone is going to take action and how fast they are gonna do it. Every character ( Aurora included) has strenghs and weaknesses , same goes for enemies. You can change chars by swapping them in battle. You dont get punished for changing a character . After a while you can indentify the enemies and know what to do . What should be mentioned is that you can avoid all battles except bosses . Also you can run from them.  Exploring Go see the screenshots . you fly up and high and the wind brushes your hair and you are free. You are almost always airbound (at least i did it) , and everything is within reach either by you or the shiny blue ball. Overall if you like fairy tales this game is just for you . Even if you dont, i think you can find a place in your heart for Lemuria and Aurora . This game is a piece or art in which you can actually play . the only bad thing i find is that the game is short and has little to no replay value .			"

												At first glance, Child of Light looks like a children's nursry story with 2d platforming elements. However if you dig down a little bit further you find a story with a very dark tone to it, and a very rich battle system that will keep you engaged for hours. In fact, the battle system is the best part of the game.I recorded on a video reviewing the games battle system in-depth: 


Child of Light Battle System Review 
A Video of 
By: OpenWorldAddict

			In this video I go over the Child of Light battle system and what I like about it. This video is meant to go along side with my Child of Light review on Steam.		


It is very reminiscent of the battle system from the Grandia games. That battle system was my favorite of all jrpg's from the playstation 2 era. This game takes a unique twist on that system, and adds complexity through Oculi system.The story itself is interesting, but the constant rhyming can get it a little boring. There isn't much for character customization other than choosing which branch of the different skill trees your characters go down.Strategy Tip: Pick one branch of the skill tree for each character until you unlock all the major skills on that branch.Oh and don't think you'll find your normal inns and shops in the locals you encournter along the way. There is none. All the items that you will get will either be from chests or enemy drops.Nonetheless, it is the battle system that uplifts this game to a much higher rating than there would be without it.Graphics: Good 7.0Music: Mediocre 6.0Story (plot): Good 7.5Story (writing): Mediocre 6.0Gameplay (customization) Good 7.0Gameplay (Battle) Superb 9.0Overall: Great 8.0So if you are a fan of Japanese Roleplaying games, and want to try a new game with a interesting story and a wonderful, captivating and engaging battle system, I absolutely recommend that you get this game.

												This game is probably the closest thing an ""indie"" game can get to perfection. The music is a masterpiece, the gameplay is refreshing, the characters are interesting, the story is well written, the art is fantastic, and the difficulty curve perfectly keeps the game challenging but fair once you get used to the game mechanics. If a game ever truly deserves a 10/10 score, this would probably be it.Of course, this isn't truely an indie game, as Ubisoft is the one releasing it. In fact, every single negative of the game I can think of (with the exception of the game being somewhat short for an RPG with little replay value) is related to this. The equipment cash-grab DLC (seriously - don't buy those), Uplay, the terrible achievement system, and an unnecessary two-player oriented mechanic are all things that drag down the game. All in all though, if you can live with Uplay and like RPGs, this game is a must play.			"

												Child of Light is easily one of the best games I have played this year. It is beautiful in every shape or form. Any game I automatically add its soundtrack to my playlist is usually close to a masterpiece. I was humming the music throughout my whole playthrough. Even though it is supposed to be a short and sweet experience, I felt stuck in its world for a very long time. Combat is simplistic in concept and gradually becomes complex and remains challenging throughout the playthrough based on the difficulty you choose. I can keep on talking about how much this game is great, but that would be wasting the reader's time on not playing it.			"

												Although this game had pleasant music and art, I had a hard time enjoying it due to its combat system and bland storyline. Though the dialogue's rhyming scheme was endearing, this wasn't enough to make me care any more for the characters themselves or what they were doing. It feels like alot of effort was put into how battles flow, but I felt it was more like a chore the further I got into the game, between constantly switching characters on and off and reworking and managing oculi, the game's equipment socket system (materia). If that's your thing, great. Just not something I felt like pursuing anymore.			"

The emptiness of the world might even be forgivable if the story  was compelling but here it also falls fairly flat and is a rather predictable cliche. might be a good kids game but I lost interest at the final boss and haven't been able to bring myself to complete it due to apathy.

Posted: August 14, 2015
												I’m going to start this review with something that sounds like a slam, though it isn't: I really wanted to love Child of Light. But I didn’t. The reason that I wanted to love it is that from the very first trailer I saw I was enchanted with the graphical styles of the game. This enchantment lasted well into my first playthrough; well past the point where I tired of some game elements I was still excited just to look at each new part of the world Child of Light laid out for me. Every bit of scenery and every sprite looks hand crafted. Winsome characters and sumptuous backgrounds have the look of ink and watercolor art from some gorgeous, moody storybook. Woods give way to craggy rocks give way to villages revealing one stunning tableau after another. Broken statues stare poignantly. Light shines through stained glass and down from treetops. Giants are visible in the hazy distance… There is beauty, often mixed with melancholy, everywhere—even the fights are suffused with it. The animation of Aurora, the protagonist, is also arresting. The attention paid to the movement of her long hair alone is worthy of mention, as are the animations of her wielding a sword clearly too heavy for her tiny body. All this is true, but my reaction to the game as a whole is more measured. As mentioned, you play as Aurora, an Austrian princess snatched into a fantasy land where she must lead a struggle against the Queen of Dark whose aim is to steal all natural light in the kingdom. You must recruit allies to your party and complete quests to defeat the Queen. Gameply is a mix of metroidvania, side-scroller environments with puzzles, and quasi-turn-based RPG battles. The integration of these two is interesting: encounters are not random. Monsters are visible in the over-world, and how you interact with them there determines who has the initiative at the beginning of a fight. Another interesting mechanic is that your cursor is a character, a glowing sprite, which moves independently of Aurora and interacts with the environment aiding her progress. Mousing over objects is often counted as the sprite interacting with them, so to some degree you are controlling two characters at once. In general, the over world elements of play are quite easy, though.Battles involve two party members squaring off against a squad of monsters. The action is driven by a timeline, with each character receiving actions at intervals. This differs from a turn-based system in that the intervals vary significantly between combatants, and can be further manipulated by player actions. Character progression, via a branching maze of unlockable nodes ala FF X, unlock new combat abilities. This simple mechanic generates a variety of interesting fights, though by the end of the game I felt the battles were becoming somewhat monotonous, as often happens with turn-based battle mechanics in simple games.The game is linier and story-driven. It is here that I had my major complaints. The game creators aimed for a moving coming of age story. (If you have seen it, the Neil Gaiman movie Mirrormask seems to be very much the sort of thing they were aiming for.) But this falls short in a number of ways. One reason is that story scenes are done in a kind of storybook mode with largely static images of the characters acompanied by text. Compared to the rest of the game these sequences are oddly uncharismatic. But a much more major shortcoming is the dialogue itself. The game sets all dialogue in verse. But it seems the writers did not have the skill to make this device actually work for them resulting in bad rhymes and perpetually stilted wording. This verbal lack of poise is oddly at odds with the stunning visual beauty of the game. Perhaps these factors alone are enough to explain my mixed feelings towards the story.In the final count Child of light still offers a wondrous world to explore and marvel at, it still casts a spell. It just didn’t quite live up to its potential. I was left feeling that if every aspect of the game showed the beauty and polish that the graphics do then Child of Light would be one of the greats. The gorgeous, well-built, casual RPG Child of Light actually is makes me badly wish I could play that game.			"

												Bought this game in a bundle of 3 games for $13.50 in total so I'll assume $4.50 was spent on this game.I enjoyed almost everything about this game. It is a platformer/puzzle/turn-based RPG game in which all three would fall in the ""casual"" category. The music, art, gameplay was all very good. Nothing about this game was complicated and the battle system was not intricate.Your gear was combining/upgrading gems that give different abilities or effects and it can be unequipped or changed without penalty. A lot of party members, to choose from but you can only use 2 at a time. You can switch them mid battle without penalty or losing a turn incase one is about to get knocked out. Each character has their own pro/cons. Other than that, it is a stright forward turned based battle system with a bar that lets you know who might be going next (stronger abilites take longer time to get ready).Some things in the story was never explained (i.e. *Spoiler Alert* *Spoiler Alert* the flooding I assumed was caused by the main villain, but it never stopped even after her defeat).The ""confessions"" which are hidden notes you find that pieces together a story was never explained. I have no idea who those people are that is mentioned in the confessions or what significane they play in the game at all. (None i guess since I beat the game and still don't know who they were.)The ending of the game seemed very rushed and a little online research suggests content was removed before release. *Spoiler Alert**Spoiler Alert* After I got my♥♥♥♥♥whooped and was revived and powered up I was excited to go through another dungeon etc etc fight the villain etc, but nothing.♥♥♥♥♥whooped - power up cut-scene and final boss. The end.I did enjoy the overall game though despite that end.--------------tl;drI estimated i spent $4.50 for this game.Light-hearted platformer, puzzle and rpg game with some exploring.Great visuals, music, story (for the most part).Straight forward turn based combat system.Lots of party members but only 2 can be active at a time.A few things never explained and show no connection with the game story.Rating 7.5/10 (+2 Story, +1Music, +2 Price, +1 Visuals, +1 Smooth Controlling, +2 Overall good game, -0.5 noticeably rushed final battle, -1 no connection with notes of ""confessions"" and the game I was playing besides finding them because they are hidden, and some elements never explained)			"

												An absolutely stellar experience.  This game does not only provide a flawless delivery of artistic ambiance and lovely storyline written completely in poetry, but strategic and stimulating turn-based combat.  Follow a mythical storyline in a hand painted atmosphere to the rythm of well pieced together music, and accompanied by a small faerie (not to mention several interchangable characters with different attributes during combat).  Envigorating, beautiful, and original; this game has defenitely earned my repsect.			"

												After playing through the entire game and doing most of the side content, I'm still torn. I can't recommend it in good conscience however.Gameplay: The combat feels like a classic JRPG but with some real-time elements that allow you to control a secondary character (or let someone else use the mouse to do so). This guy can collect healing objects for you, or even slow down your enemies on the timeline which is incredibly useful and adds a new dynamic to trying to interrupt your enemies. Overall I enjoyed the classic combat. My one major gripe is that you only ever can have 2 of your party members out at a time, which seems absurd to me. Especially since your enemies routinely have 3.Art: You can't say enough about the art style. It's got a brilliant storybook feel that is woven throughout the story as well. The color palette and style is bold and refreshing. Animation leaves a lot to be desired however, as they all look more like paper cutouts hanging from strings.Story/Writing: This is what ruins the game for me. The story is hopelessly childish and unoriginal, which leaves me wondering what the target audience is. I do realize that this matches the visual style, but there must be ways to achieve a story that is appealing to adults while maintaining the whimsical visuals. Things like Trine 2 or Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons did this wonderfully. Overall the story was sickeningly saccharine. In contrast, Brothers started out extremely fanciful, but quick got dark and serious in it's themes. They're both coming-of-age tales, but Brothers pulled it off in a much more brilliant and emotional way (and without words, yet!). In Child of Light, you'll never care about any of the characters. Speaking of words, I must say a few about the poetry. I feel as if the poetry could have saved the hokey story. However, the poetry was dreadful. The writers made no attempt to compose with any meter or rhythm, but instead stuck stubbornly to their A-B-A-B rhyme scheme regardless of the cadence of the sentences. Shakespeare is rolling in his grave. I love great poetry when it has a solid rhythm and bounce to it (See Penny Arcade's Twisp and Catsby stuff!), but this sounded more like a junior high student writing poetry for the first time. Even the rhymes were a stretch from time to time, and left you gagging or saying ""oh come on, really?!"".In conclusion, I give this a ""NO"" with a very heavy heart. I wanted to like it so bad. There were parts of it I really enjoyed. But I found myself rushing from battle to battle in order to enjoy the combat, while the story left me wanting. I don't mind a good kid's story. But this wasn't just a kid's story, it was downright childish and lame. If you think the beautiful art and great combat can redeem an ignorable story, then maybe give this a try. But for me, it wasn't worth the 10 hours.			"

												Hnnnnnng this GAME!Everything about this game from the art design to the music to the rhyming dialogue is just so gosh darn charming. The battle system utilizes a ""time bar"" that determines when your characters and your enemies act. As each unit's turn bubble moves from left to right on the time bar, there are two thresholds that they pass through: first, one where they determine what action they are about to take, and second, one where they take said action. If a unit is attacked while in between these two thresholds their turn is delayed, making for some pretty strategic and challenging battles.(Keep in mind I haven't beaten the game yet so the majority of the plot is still unknown to me) The story is about a little girl lost in a dream world and trying to find a way back home, but there seems to be an underlying story to it all that isn't told to us right away...! As your adventure unfolds you encounter several different party members to help you in battle, each one adding a different strategy and play style. These partners all have very distinct personalities and interact with each other outside of battle from time to time in fairly humorous exchanges. I have yet to find a character I DIDN'T like.The environments are beautiful and so far for me have ranged from a lush forest to dark and dangerous looking mines to heated lava caverns. The map could be described as ""linear"" but honestly there are tons of hidden treasures and even some optional mini bosses that you could easily miss if you didn't look hard enough. Overall I feel the environments are very well put together and at no point have they bored me.This game has scratched pretty much every itch that I have as a RPG lover: engaging battle system that makes me WANT to fight the next enemy, a beautifully told story that has just enough mystery to make me keep pushing forward, as well as a very likable and distinguished cast of characters. I could not recommend this game to other RPG lovers enough.			"

												This is one of the most fantastic RPG games I've ever played, and will appeal to both RPG and fans of the JRPG subgenre. With beautiful art work, character development, an immersive story, and humour, people will find themselves lost in this game, and coming to love the main character, perhaps without even realizing it.In addition to the art work, the battle system is active and rewarding. The game augments the traditonal turn based combat system of the turn based RPG, by creating the 'action bar', which is a time based system that shows how close a character is to being able to act, and the time it will take to complete an action. With the help of Igniculus, a character you meet right at the start of the game, you are able to influence the time it will take enemies to act, and if you're clever, you can interrupt an opponent in the middle of an action, potentially eliminating their ability to do anything throughout a battle. Beware though, because the same weakness applies to you!So with the fantastic and beautiful story, and simplistic but innovative battle system, the reasons to love this game are many, and even if it's something totally new to a would be buyer, it's something I recommend to everyone.*** I see a lot of concern over 'Uplay'. This is my only game I use through Uplay (and steam), and I can attest that Uplay isn't hard to use at all. You just start this game via steam, and it'll open through Uplay, it's not annoying at all (though I would add that you want Uplay to remember your log in information if you want to skip the several seconds it takes to log in!).

												My wife and I selected this game,because it offered a co-op campaign.we loved the art, right from the start,'til the last monster was slain-------------------------------------------------------------I'm reviewing this from the perspective of someone who played as the secondary character while my wife controlled the main player through our 15 hour campaign. Right away I want to applaud the game developers for creating an interesting co-op mechanic. The main player in solo play could just control the secondary role themselves (in fact they still can while another person is plugged in), if you are able to multitask and be effective it pays off to control the sprite character during hard battles. Giving the second player the role of this sprite splits the responsibility so that you don't have to consider as many options during fights, but you will still want to coordinate with the other player to perfect your timing.It's obvious that this game is uniquely beautiful. Ubisoft came up with a graphics engine that does a great job representing the mythical storied universe that the game takes place in. It's like someone added a physics engine to a children's book watercolor drawing. The story is told in the form of a poem, which is fun in spirit, but it's not always executed as well as I would have hoped. Otherwise, this is a very solid RPG game with great controller and co-op support.4/5			"

Though later on it got easier.  The toughest part was early/mid game.  Combat was fun and difficult.  Story was meh, but the gameplay was there.  Highly recommend.  Ubisoftware sucks, but worth it for this imo.    It felt like a great little indie rpg.  Just what I was looking for :)			"

												Good music. Good Art style. Good combat, a refreshing take on turn based battles. The rhyming during cutscenes can get on your nerves, but is tollerable for most of it. Would be very good to play with children. Tad on the easy side so if you want a challenge set it to hard.			"

												This is a great RPG with a beautiful soundtrack, story, art direction, and some very unique gameplay. I've never multitasked so much in ATB style combat, and the characters are all overall very unique. The character customization system is also brilliant, similar to the sphere grid in Final Fantasy X. Wonderful game, I'd recommend it to just about anyone.			"

												Child of Light is easily one of the best games I have played this year. It is beautiful in every shape or form. Any game I automatically add its soundtrack to my playlist is usually close to a masterpiece. I was humming the music throughout my whole playthrough. Even though it is supposed to be a short and sweet experience, I felt stuck in its world for a very long time. Combat is simplistic in concept and gradually becomes complex and remains challenging throughout the playthrough based on the difficulty you choose. I can keep on talking about how much this game is great, but that would be wasting the reader's time on not playing it.			"

												Although this game had pleasant music and art, I had a hard time enjoying it due to its combat system and bland storyline. Though the dialogue's rhyming scheme was endearing, this wasn't enough to make me care any more for the characters themselves or what they were doing. It feels like alot of effort was put into how battles flow, but I felt it was more like a chore the further I got into the game, between constantly switching characters on and off and reworking and managing oculi, the game's equipment socket system (materia). If that's your thing, great. Just not something I felt like pursuing anymore.			"

												An amazing visual style, varying locations, challenging boss fights (don't play on casual difficulty!), memorable heroes and somewhat interesting, albeit predictable, story. I don't want to write much, just watch the game trailer and then go buy it.Oh, and if there are more games like this one and Valiant Hearts, I can almost forgive Ubisoft the fact they killed Prince of Persia franchise and pretty much cancelled or postponed indefinitely Beyond Good & Evil 2.

												Hnnnnnng this GAME!Everything about this game from the art design to the music to the rhyming dialogue is just so gosh darn charming. The battle system utilizes a ""time bar"" that determines when your characters and your enemies act. As each unit's turn bubble moves from left to right on the time bar, there are two thresholds that they pass through: first, one where they determine what action they are about to take, and second, one where they take said action. If a unit is attacked while in between these two thresholds their turn is delayed, making for some pretty strategic and challenging battles.(Keep in mind I haven't beaten the game yet so the majority of the plot is still unknown to me) The story is about a little girl lost in a dream world and trying to find a way back home, but there seems to be an underlying story to it all that isn't told to us right away...! As your adventure unfolds you encounter several different party members to help you in battle, each one adding a different strategy and play style. These partners all have very distinct personalities and interact with each other outside of battle from time to time in fairly humorous exchanges. I have yet to find a character I DIDN'T like.The environments are beautiful and so far for me have ranged from a lush forest to dark and dangerous looking mines to heated lava caverns. The map could be described as ""linear"" but honestly there are tons of hidden treasures and even some optional mini bosses that you could easily miss if you didn't look hard enough. Overall I feel the environments are very well put together and at no point have they bored me.This game has scratched pretty much every itch that I have as a RPG lover: engaging battle system that makes me WANT to fight the next enemy, a beautifully told story that has just enough mystery to make me keep pushing forward, as well as a very likable and distinguished cast of characters. I could not recommend this game to other RPG lovers enough.			"

												I think Child of Light was very unique and even though it had to be played through Uplay, which had a slow start-up- I didn't mind. The art, music, and animation made it worth the 3 minute wait to start-up. Only criticism is after you beat the game there aren't any more quests (that I've found) and the only option that gives me is to start a new game... Going to stress once again how beautiful the animation and artwork is. Gameplay is simple and quick to pick up on.			"

It features good music a revenge saga storyline and a great gameplay. I played it on 1920*1080, it also supports 4K resolution.It is a good RPG and worth buying especially if it is on sale, it will give a decent 10 - 12 hours of gameplay. During the initial levels it is a bit tough. However, aftre you level up stick to a strategy it will work wonders for you. "

												I found this to be a solid and charming RPG.  Dont let the ubisoft brand fool you.  I played for a bit over 18 hrs and enjoyed this game quite a bit.The gameplay is, if anything, a bit too easy in the same way that Kingdom Hearts is.  If you are modestly competent almost every fight wont be challenging even at the harder difficulty setting, but it's still enjoyable to play.  Combat is similar to an ATB system with actions being queued up on a time bar before being performed.  Some actions can be interrupted, others affect a characters turn in some way, allowing for some finesse and control on the part of the player.  This comes along with an ATB-independent heal the player can perform with his mouse cursor that uses its own slowly recharging resource, and for some reason I found the balance between the two fairly enjoyable and engaging.  In the more tense fights, healing characters at the right moments was crucial along with timing when you would be able to heal again after expending all of your resource was fairly important.  Characters are diverse and can fit varied roles in combat, enough that I didnt feel like I should stick to just a few that I might like.  Outside of combat puzzles are fairly easy and nothing too complex or ingenious comes up, and there is some light exploration and backtracking for rewards you can do as well.  Exploration does kind of fall flat a little because they give you complete exploration powers very shortly into the game, but its also not a metroidvania title so calling it a 'missed opportunity' or like doesn't quite fit.  Jamming RPG, light crafting mechanics, skill trees, exploration, etc all into a game is a lot and eventually you'd end up with feature bloat.The story has a kind of light fairytail whimsy to it, in the way that some aspects are obscured or ambiguous or mean to be accepted prima facie.  It works out for the most part, and the way they presented the world and characters was satisfying.  and had some nice twists too. Some people dont like the rhyming dialogue, but I did.  I liked most all of the characters too, even a few I expected not to on first glance like Rubella.  I think if anything one of the problems they had was the sin of taking away a character from the player whom one might have expended permanent stat upgrade consumables on, and also in introducing one character too late and letting a few others kind of flounder a bit.  Still, the ones that did get time in the story were nice.I'd highly recommend it, it's not a top 5 title but it definitely went into my favorites.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Child of Light is a beautiful RPG game developed and published by Ubisoft. From start to finish it shows a solid gameplay, a vibrant world, and a quite interesting story with more than a few twists.Sound design is amazing, and graphically speaking, the game looks magnificent, and everytime you reach a new place, you find yourself looking at every place of the screen, mindblowing designs and drawings that are taken out of a fairy tale, beautiful. The magic of the game is greatly resembled too, and it's one of the strongest points in the game.The amount of hours might look short for an RPG, but it's not really short clocking in at around 10-11 hours in total. The game doesn't drag on, some battles are indeed hard but can be overtaken by strategy, the story from start to finish feels good, like reading a book. It's all fun from start to finish, and at the end you feel realized and full because it doesn't leave you wanting for more like some other gamesThe gameplay is a turn-based fighting RPG, which is fast, there's no long animations and it's really fun thanks to constantly being in motion, you will be using characters in the fight that you can swap at any time, there are quite a few characters. They of course level up, and you'll have to see what's the best course of action regarding their skills. I want to mention that it's very fun to move as the protagonist too, specially with the amount of secrets that are everywhere! Nothing falls short in the gameplay portion of the game!I love the fact that the story is told in rhyme which adds a lovely touch to the game. Overall, Child of Light is a game that offers a great time guaranteed for RPG players, you can't really go wrong with this game. Shame about the forced DRM of Uplay but it's Ubisoft, what do you expect? RECOMMENDED :)  Also, best to play with a controller  "

Posted: August 14, 2015
												I’m going to start this review with something that sounds like a slam, though it isn't: I really wanted to love Child of Light. But I didn’t. The reason that I wanted to love it is that from the very first trailer I saw I was enchanted with the graphical styles of the game. This enchantment lasted well into my first playthrough; well past the point where I tired of some game elements I was still excited just to look at each new part of the world Child of Light laid out for me. Every bit of scenery and every sprite looks hand crafted. Winsome characters and sumptuous backgrounds have the look of ink and watercolor art from some gorgeous, moody storybook. Woods give way to craggy rocks give way to villages revealing one stunning tableau after another. Broken statues stare poignantly. Light shines through stained glass and down from treetops. Giants are visible in the hazy distance… There is beauty, often mixed with melancholy, everywhere—even the fights are suffused with it. The animation of Aurora, the protagonist, is also arresting. The attention paid to the movement of her long hair alone is worthy of mention, as are the animations of her wielding a sword clearly too heavy for her tiny body. All this is true, but my reaction to the game as a whole is more measured. As mentioned, you play as Aurora, an Austrian princess snatched into a fantasy land where she must lead a struggle against the Queen of Dark whose aim is to steal all natural light in the kingdom. You must recruit allies to your party and complete quests to defeat the Queen. Gameply is a mix of metroidvania, side-scroller environments with puzzles, and quasi-turn-based RPG battles. The integration of these two is interesting: encounters are not random. Monsters are visible in the over-world, and how you interact with them there determines who has the initiative at the beginning of a fight. Another interesting mechanic is that your cursor is a character, a glowing sprite, which moves independently of Aurora and interacts with the environment aiding her progress. Mousing over objects is often counted as the sprite interacting with them, so to some degree you are controlling two characters at once. In general, the over world elements of play are quite easy, though.Battles involve two party members squaring off against a squad of monsters. The action is driven by a timeline, with each character receiving actions at intervals. This differs from a turn-based system in that the intervals vary significantly between combatants, and can be further manipulated by player actions. Character progression, via a branching maze of unlockable nodes ala FF X, unlock new combat abilities. This simple mechanic generates a variety of interesting fights, though by the end of the game I felt the battles were becoming somewhat monotonous, as often happens with turn-based battle mechanics in simple games.The game is linier and story-driven. It is here that I had my major complaints. The game creators aimed for a moving coming of age story. (If you have seen it, the Neil Gaiman movie Mirrormask seems to be very much the sort of thing they were aiming for.) But this falls short in a number of ways. One reason is that story scenes are done in a kind of storybook mode with largely static images of the characters acompanied by text. Compared to the rest of the game these sequences are oddly uncharismatic. But a much more major shortcoming is the dialogue itself. The game sets all dialogue in verse. But it seems the writers did not have the skill to make this device actually work for them resulting in bad rhymes and perpetually stilted wording. This verbal lack of poise is oddly at odds with the stunning visual beauty of the game. Perhaps these factors alone are enough to explain my mixed feelings towards the story.In the final count Child of light still offers a wondrous world to explore and marvel at, it still casts a spell. It just didn’t quite live up to its potential. I was left feeling that if every aspect of the game showed the beauty and polish that the graphics do then Child of Light would be one of the greats. The gorgeous, well-built, casual RPG Child of Light actually is makes me badly wish I could play that game.			"

												Bought this game in a bundle of 3 games for $13.50 in total so I'll assume $4.50 was spent on this game.I enjoyed almost everything about this game. It is a platformer/puzzle/turn-based RPG game in which all three would fall in the ""casual"" category. The music, art, gameplay was all very good. Nothing about this game was complicated and the battle system was not intricate.Your gear was combining/upgrading gems that give different abilities or effects and it can be unequipped or changed without penalty. A lot of party members, to choose from but you can only use 2 at a time. You can switch them mid battle without penalty or losing a turn incase one is about to get knocked out. Each character has their own pro/cons. Other than that, it is a stright forward turned based battle system with a bar that lets you know who might be going next (stronger abilites take longer time to get ready).Some things in the story was never explained (i.e. *Spoiler Alert* *Spoiler Alert* the flooding I assumed was caused by the main villain, but it never stopped even after her defeat).The ""confessions"" which are hidden notes you find that pieces together a story was never explained. I have no idea who those people are that is mentioned in the confessions or what significane they play in the game at all. (None i guess since I beat the game and still don't know who they were.)The ending of the game seemed very rushed and a little online research suggests content was removed before release. *Spoiler Alert**Spoiler Alert* After I got my♥♥♥♥♥whooped and was revived and powered up I was excited to go through another dungeon etc etc fight the villain etc, but nothing.♥♥♥♥♥whooped - power up cut-scene and final boss. The end.I did enjoy the overall game though despite that end.--------------tl;drI estimated i spent $4.50 for this game.Light-hearted platformer, puzzle and rpg game with some exploring.Great visuals, music, story (for the most part).Straight forward turn based combat system.Lots of party members but only 2 can be active at a time.A few things never explained and show no connection with the game story.Rating 7.5/10 (+2 Story, +1Music, +2 Price, +1 Visuals, +1 Smooth Controlling, +2 Overall good game, -0.5 noticeably rushed final battle, -1 no connection with notes of ""confessions"" and the game I was playing besides finding them because they are hidden, and some elements never explained)			"

												Thanks goodness, I chose to play Child of Light after my embarrassing gameplay of L4D2. I knew this was my cup of tea because I always love role-playing games (RPG). I'm a huge fan of beautiful artwork and captivating storytelling. Child of Light brings me back to the time of exploration and the freedom of feeling like a child again, even though it's in a game. Hardcore RPG fans may find this too short. However I love that this is a good introduction to players who are first time to RPG and those like me who want to enjoy the ambience of the world rather than being stressed out by upgrading your characters.I also like it that the story is kept at a good pace. and boss fights are manageable with a degree of challenge.Games are created for entertainment and Child of Light has swept off my feet long enough to finish the whole game. It has done very well. As for those still on the fence about Child of Light because of UPlay, please give it a try with the demo version. UPlay might not suck as much as you'd think it is.			"

												I finished this game and that's really saying something.  I usually lose interest eventually and don't finish.  This one has that perfect balance to where it kept me entertained and interested enough to continue playing, but didn't make me dedicate too much as far as time and patience.  I recommend it for gamers like myself who prefer less depth on occasion for the sake of being able to jump in and play it for an hour or two after work.  Here are a few pros and cons because I'm not much of a composer.+Beautiful artwork+Fast paced yet turn based combat that's entertaining enough to make you want more+Lots of secret loot to find+Crafting is very simple but effective+Character progression is well-balanced+Diverse characters with lots of different skills+Ease of travel+Shallow story for shallow folks+Short and sweet+Reasonably priced, especially at the 60% off discount-Poetic dialogue is pretty cheesy, but I get it-Potions are a bit useless unless you're in a dire situation-Could have used a little more difficulty in combat, just a littleI give it an 8/10, if they ever make a second one, I will insta-buy.P.S.  I should also say that Uplay is not a big deal in any shape or form.  I see a lot of people freaking out over it, but they're just being dramatic pansies.  In the 24 hours it took me to beat this, I saw the Uplay screen a total of about 60 seconds. It never once interfered with anything at all.  Also, if it prevents piracy, I'm all for it.  Get a job and buy your games, people work hard on them. "

												TL;DR: Pleasantly surprising RPG reminiscent of JRPGs like Final Fantasy with good artwork, music, and a fun combat systemAlright,So I don't know exactly what prompted me to buy this game other than the nice artstyle that was presented. Day of release and a couple hours in I actually found myself recommending it to my friends.Artstyle-wise: I absolutely loved it. Throughout the entire game I found myself just paused at some of the scenes wondering if I should be taking a screenshot. Dialogue wise there were moments where I found myself chuckling at the humor.Gameplay-wise: I played on hard difficulty which wasn't quite apparent until maybe halfway into the game where counter-interrupts and status effects started plaguing me, but I quickly adapted to using ailment protection so that wasn't too bad. There wasn't much need for grinding so to say, which made the RPG aspect much more enjoyable as I could just plow straight through the story. The combat aspect takes up a majority of the gameplay with a touch of exploration, especially looking for stardusts (permanent power up bonuses). Combat is a lot of fun with a timeline based combat that tells you ""who goes next"" while still remaining intuitive. The kicker however is the fireflly, where you can use him to slow enemies JUST ENOUGH so that you can interrupt them.Story-wise: The game gives me a JRPG type of feel which I am completely okay withOverall: I had an enjoyable time exploring everything. I think it's at least worth a look at if your into RPGs			"

												So I really like this game.   It is so much fun.   Kinda dark but more of a longing worry than horror with some really fitting piano soundtrack.   I sorta though it would be a bit of a platformer but to my surprise it is more of an rpg.  The turn based combat can be a bit slow.   However, the story and beautiful artwork make up for it.  Something like a cross between nights into dreams meets final fantasy.  Also, add in a bit of fairy tale and that equals child of light.			"

												Really solid JRPG elements, fairly bad writing. Pros:-Leveling system and Gem system feel familiar if you've played literally ANY JRPG in the world-Skill system is useful; noticeable boosts to your character(s)-Big cast, always nice to have-Unique 2D sidescrolling exploration is surprisingly engrossing-Battle system has a pretty good implementation of time (think original FF's with Hastega and stuff)Cons:-Writing is cringey and makes me want to claw my face off-Very few skill tree choices-Very few Gem choices-A lot of the characters seem to be similar stat-wise, tbh. Haven't gone hardcore min/max on this game so I can't 100% say though-Game is kinda easy			"

												I highly recommend this game; it is lovely.  The music and art design enchant and the gameplay reminds me of an old school JRPG with improvements.  It lacks difficulty unless you play on hard.  The rest of this is slightly spoiler-ish.Combat: Turned based with a timer.  Each combatant appears on the timer bar so you can track the order and the bar is divided into two parts.  The first part is ""wait"" in which the combatants do not act; the second part is ""cast"" which is when the combatants prepare to act.  While the combat is turn based, the addition of the ""cast"" part of the timer bar allows for actions to be interrupted which adds greater complexity.  Additionally, different combatants traverse the timer bar at different speeds and different actions do as well.  An action that takes more time to perform may be interrupted by a slower enemy because that enemy used a faster attack.  Overall, this is a major improvement over classic turn based combat.Adventuring: At first, the game appears to be a platformer.  However, once Aurora gains the ability to fly, the areas become much more open and free with no more platforming.  She can fly over the obstacles, after all.  A little firefly accompanies Aurora as well and interacts with chests, blinds enemies, and collects ""wishes"" which replenish the party's HP/MP.  Blinding the enemies allows Aurora to bypass them or get behind them for a surprise attack.  I should mention, that most enemies can be avoided; in other words, there are no random encounters.  The experience is almost therapeutic when combined with the music and art.  There are very few load screens because the areas are quite expansive.Graphics: It looks like a hand-drawn storybook.  While it is a sidescroller, the environments incorporate a foreground and background providing the illusion of depth and extra details such as wild animals and the occasional giant in the background.  The world does not seem as desolate as it does in most sidescrollers.  The animations are smooth and fluid.Story: I have not experienced enough of the story to adequately judge it, but it does seem quite good thus far.  If the occasional interruptions are canonical, the story is being told by a mother as a bedtime story.  In conjunction with the graphics, it maintains grants tremendous character to the game as a whole.  The dialogue consists of a ABCB rhyme scheme (except for one comical character) to replicate an epic poem of old.			"

The environments and lighting are gorgeous, the dialogue is fun (and rhyming!), the pacing seems pretty good, it lets you explore a lot and the difficulty curve is well done. Skill progression is simple and well thought-out. The music is your basic piano pieces with orchestral music during combat scenes, but it works really well and adds a lot to the atmosphere. Plus it's composed by a really good French Canadian singer!The story is fairly simplistic, but there's a lot of room for it to become more complex, and if my first party member is representative of the rest, the game will have very interesting side-characters.

												CoL has a very enjoyable story for all ages. From Aurora's flowing hair to the pitter patter of her running around barefoot the graphics and sound are very detailed. The dialogue and story isn't overly complex and allowing your kids to play with you is a Plus. The turn-based battle system is interactive and keeps you alert unlike others you may have experienced. The skill system is deep enough to add variation to your prefered playstyle.   Concerning Uplay: There is nothing wrong with Uplay. It has a rewards and achievements system that actually makes it worth it. I personally don't see what the fuss is about.  I feel once you get the hang of the battle system and immerse yourself into the story you will have one of the most pleasant RPG experiences this year.			"

												Thanks goodness, I chose to play Child of Light after my embarrassing gameplay of L4D2. I knew this was my cup of tea because I always love role-playing games (RPG). I'm a huge fan of beautiful artwork and captivating storytelling. Child of Light brings me back to the time of exploration and the freedom of feeling like a child again, even though it's in a game. Hardcore RPG fans may find this too short. However I love that this is a good introduction to players who are first time to RPG and those like me who want to enjoy the ambience of the world rather than being stressed out by upgrading your characters.I also like it that the story is kept at a good pace. and boss fights are manageable with a degree of challenge.Games are created for entertainment and Child of Light has swept off my feet long enough to finish the whole game. It has done very well. As for those still on the fence about Child of Light because of UPlay, please give it a try with the demo version. UPlay might not suck as much as you'd think it is.			"

												After playing through the entire game and doing most of the side content, I'm still torn. I can't recommend it in good conscience however.Gameplay: The combat feels like a classic JRPG but with some real-time elements that allow you to control a secondary character (or let someone else use the mouse to do so). This guy can collect healing objects for you, or even slow down your enemies on the timeline which is incredibly useful and adds a new dynamic to trying to interrupt your enemies. Overall I enjoyed the classic combat. My one major gripe is that you only ever can have 2 of your party members out at a time, which seems absurd to me. Especially since your enemies routinely have 3.Art: You can't say enough about the art style. It's got a brilliant storybook feel that is woven throughout the story as well. The color palette and style is bold and refreshing. Animation leaves a lot to be desired however, as they all look more like paper cutouts hanging from strings.Story/Writing: This is what ruins the game for me. The story is hopelessly childish and unoriginal, which leaves me wondering what the target audience is. I do realize that this matches the visual style, but there must be ways to achieve a story that is appealing to adults while maintaining the whimsical visuals. Things like Trine 2 or Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons did this wonderfully. Overall the story was sickeningly saccharine. In contrast, Brothers started out extremely fanciful, but quick got dark and serious in it's themes. They're both coming-of-age tales, but Brothers pulled it off in a much more brilliant and emotional way (and without words, yet!). In Child of Light, you'll never care about any of the characters. Speaking of words, I must say a few about the poetry. I feel as if the poetry could have saved the hokey story. However, the poetry was dreadful. The writers made no attempt to compose with any meter or rhythm, but instead stuck stubbornly to their A-B-A-B rhyme scheme regardless of the cadence of the sentences. Shakespeare is rolling in his grave. I love great poetry when it has a solid rhythm and bounce to it (See Penny Arcade's Twisp and Catsby stuff!), but this sounded more like a junior high student writing poetry for the first time. Even the rhymes were a stretch from time to time, and left you gagging or saying ""oh come on, really?!"".In conclusion, I give this a ""NO"" with a very heavy heart. I wanted to like it so bad. There were parts of it I really enjoyed. But I found myself rushing from battle to battle in order to enjoy the combat, while the story left me wanting. I don't mind a good kid's story. But this wasn't just a kid's story, it was downright childish and lame. If you think the beautiful art and great combat can redeem an ignorable story, then maybe give this a try. But for me, it wasn't worth the 10 hours.			"

The added RPG elements make it a very interesting side scroller.

												I love turned-based combat rpg's and this one is pretty good. The art style is pleasant and the sounds and music are great. The enemies and bosses are pretty good and there are many spell and skill types as well as skill upgrade choices. The rhyming in cut scene's and normal dialogue (all of it is rhymed) makes me want to barf but whatever, that's an after thought when I bought the game for its gameplay which is solid. Pretty fun game to catch on sale and play through once.			"

												My previous review was one word long: ""unplayable"". Let me elaborate on this. The number one reason is that the game is a crappy console port. It runs 10 FPS on a high-end PC in full-screen mode. The other major flaw of this game is that you need to have a UPlay account to play it. WHY? Why did Ubisoft even create it? So, you start the game from Steam, that is one client already, and then it logs into UPlay. Brilliant.Anyway, the game itself would be a pretty easy RPG but the 10 FPS lag makes it unplayable.			"

												A work of art.  After playing the first two hours, I'm mesmerized.  Playing on hard mode has provided a sense of accomplishment after beating the first two significant enemies.  The whole world looks like it's been watercolored and it looks amazing.  There's soothing music for adventuring, which turns terrifying when it needs to be.  The story narration is great and i'm invested in this girl's life.  The characters are so creative and the dialogue is purely in rhymes.  If you love creative games, you must buy this.			"

												Child of Light is a piece of art. The idea of drawing the whole game in watercolor is great. The soundtracks are just so beautiful that it will make you want to pick up the OST. The dialog and the story couldn’t be any better. If you love RPG’S as beautiful as this, then I definitely recommend this game. So far I love this game, I feel it was worth paying its price. Would be nice if we got Trading Cards for Child of Light in the near future.			"

												Pros:I like it very much, nice art, even background is amazing, it really give u very pretty atmosphere feel, but their theme is gloomy/dark, so the music, atmosphere is actually scary feeling, but nothing is scary, XDi like the battle system, althought timing bar is same like grandia 3, but still feel unique, lots of character to try, main character is cuteand their dialogue, really interesting to not to read again & againCons:lack of background music, thorough all the game, feel quite bland with no music to strike the mood, is not that they dont have bg music, is that I dont feel it, too soft, too quiet....Too short, story that near the end seem too rushing, not epic at all, even while I am playing, I keep giving myself to hope that, please do not end like this, and suddenly I fight last boss.didnt leave too much impact/attraction for replayability.Half price offer available too early, roughly less than half a year, made me feel supporting pre-order is meaningless after noticing the game is too short			"

												The artwork was nice, the music was nice.  The game in itself was super short.  It takes like 15 minutes to get through each chapter.  When I got to around a chapter and the game was suddenly seeming to lean towards ending I was like, what the hell where is the other 3 quarters of the game??  50% of the poetry was good, and the other half was terribly corny and unattractive, like the person writing couldnt think of anything good so they just stuck whatever rhymed in there.The fights are sort of grandia style with the turn timer.  There was some amount of strategy, but the game was not very challenging seeing how I didn't die once and pretty much had 95% of the potions left I had found through out the game.  I actually would reccomend the game to children between 10 and 16, but anyone older than that it would be too easy.So I reccomend the game to tweens.I do not reccomend the game to avid gamers, or rpgers looking for something with strategy and or challenge.  It just doesnt measure up to other big name rpgs.			"

												Child of Light is a basic 2D adventure through the fantasy land of Lemuria. The princess, Aurora, has died and her papa has lost hope, but with the help of unusual friends there is no time to mope. Aurora battles darkness with friends anew, hoping to see this spiritual adventure through. Magicians, jesters and warriors unite to give the princess one last chance. With each battle won, Aurora makes her advance.The attractive world of Lemura is rendered with Ubi-Art Framework, but the lack of noteworthy gameplay starts to hurt. Aurora walks or flies across colorful landscapes, stumbling upon treasures and wishes.  Wishes ignite your friendly orb of light and treasures prevent you sleeping with the fishes. The orb stuns foes left and right, but minimal exploration makes the adventure slight.  As you collide with foes, you are thrust into a contrived battle pose. Battles have your friends taking turns to eliminate foes counting three. But the nature of the combat propels enjoyment far out to sea. You jostle to deal elemental damage to susceptible foes, yet constant interrupts keep you on your toes. Once you become a master tactician, bosses turn interrupts into a war of attrition. Some bosses succumb after half an hour, making boss battles repetitive and sour. Combat is tolerable at best - how much you can endure is the true test. Just as the world lacks excitement, the un-voiced dialogue becomes an indictment. Exactly as this review is written before you, the authors were smitten with rhyming too. Some might think it funny or clever, but it becomes like persistent bad weather. If instead you find this readable, then you’ll likely find the narrative tolerable. Know that there is little that proves enlightening, even as you battle forces most frightening. If Lemuria is the land we are sent to after death, try to avoid the reaper long after your last breath. If you insist on buying Child of Light to get your arty platforming hit, don’t complain when you discover it’s quite sh…			"

												It’s an unfortunate thing when one can see the amount of effort that has been put into a game and to come away from it feeling so unsatisfied. Sadly, that is the case with regards to my experience with Child of Light.Using the UbiArt Framework to create a watercolor world of wonder, Child of Light definitely succeeds in being something lovely to look at; indeed, this is what first drew me to the game. The music is very lovely as well (even touching at times) and adds to the child-like, fairy-tale theming of the game and story. However, it is in this fairy-tale presentation that I believe the game makes its biggest misstep: rhyming.Bear with me and allow me to elaborate: I know it seems silly that something so innocuous could mar a good game. When first beginning my journey through Lemuria the rhyming came off as quite charming. The spoken narration for the cut-scenes, all written in rhyme, made it feel like a tale being told to a sleepy-eyed child and was not unwelcome in the slightest. As the game wore on, though, and the repeated reading of rhymes continued (some conversations turning bizarre just to tag a rhyme on the end), I found myself completely apathetic towards Aurora and her friends. Every line of dialogue attempts to rhyme with no consistent rhyming scheme throughout, which resulted in all interactions becoming a sort of poetic muddle, preventing any sort of personalities for the characters to shine through past their singular motivations. It’s possible that if each character spoke in a different rhyming scheme then making all dialogue rhyme in some way or another would have been successful; there’s plenty of great literature written entirely in rhyme. As it stands, though, the inconsistent schemes just make the dialogue a chore to read, as one dialogue set will rhyme one way but the next will buck the previous set’s scheme for something else. Near the game’s end, I found myself avoiding side-quests, ignoring potential new party members, and just trying to get to the game’s conclusion so that I could be done with it.All of which is incredibly disappointing because the game is perfectly functional. The combat is a decent, turn-based affair with a few little tweaks to the long-standing formula that provides additional interest and strategy: nothing to write home about but completely adequate. The same can be said of the Oculi crafting system, which allows you to create additional stat-boosting accessories for your party. These coupled with the aforementioned charming visuals and lovely music could have created a perfectly enjoyable experience but without engaging dialogue to breathe personality into the characters, world, and story, these factors all end up becoming window-dressing to an unfortunately bland experience.I really wanted to like Child of Light, too, but in the end I don’t feel that I can recommend it. For all its charms it ends up feeling without its own voice or personality, which left me feeling regrettably unfulfilled.			"

												Truly one of the most repetitive and tedious combat systems I have ever used. By the time you're halfway through the game every fight feels akin to a zubat encounter in pokemon. Other than that the soundtrack and story are nice and compelling, however in my opinion when half your gameplay is extremely painful its just not worth it. Also, when crafting, after two of three potential crafting components are ready, if you are playing with a controller it will immediately highlight the ""craft"" button, which can lead to accidental crafting. This is frustrating if you were planning on using another component. Not a big issue but still annoying.			"

												After playing Child of Light for 2 hours, i have to say its a refreshing change from a lot of the JRPG style games that have come out recently. Artistically this game is about as gorram whimsical as you can get. It reminds me a lot of older stories and fairy tales that i was told as a kid. Gameplay-wise, this is what you'd get if you crossed an indie developed puzzle-platformer like Limbo, with a game like (the old and good) final fantasy games. The combat feels great and the interupt mechanic is a nice touch.The game's music is understated and adds a great childlike atmosphere to the environment.Overall i'd say i'm going to enjoy the rest of the game if it continues along this same path.I could comment on the same day DLC, which is obviously a ubisoft cashgrab and takes away a bit of the magic of this game if you think about it too much. So i don't think about it too much! Its pretty simple.Recommended for everyone who enjoys games like FFIV-VII, Limbo, Braid or any other game in those 2 veins.Play more games!			"

												I would recommend this game to small childrens.I would not recommend this game to any JRPG fan.PROS:-Somehow interresting art if you appreciate it.CONS:-Beautifull but ultra depressive music.-Well written dialogs that I don't care to read. No voiceover? Forget about translating it in a 6th language. Can we just get English voice over?-Graphics looks like a child's storry book and animations feels like moving pieces of paper. I would rather like colorful anime style graphics.-Over simplistic everything that will fail to entertain any JRPG fan:   -Simple combat system.   -Characters have only about 3 different moves (if you completed the skill tree).   -There is crafting, but it's only oculis and ultra limitted.   -Gems (they call it oculis), that's the only thing you get in the game and you get tons of it, they are everywhere in the screen. They are annoying.   -No equipment. Really?   -Items: about 10 different items in the game. Health and magic potions, battle elixirs and perma stats boosters.   -No shops, no currency.   -Only 2 party members in combat (at the same time) and a maximum of 3 ennemies.-Interruptions concept in combat. This is pure annoyance to have to manage this.-The game is short. Only about 5 hours.CONCLUSION:Interresting piece of art, but will fail to entertain JRPG fans. Wait until the price drops below 10$ if you need to try it or just watch someone play on Twich.			"

												I hate it when I regret buying a game, but unfortunately, that is the case with Child of Light. The trailer looked *amazing* and the reviews looked positive too. I was hoping this would be a beautiful game I could lose myself in. Unfortunately that was not the case.The story of the game is about a princess who falls into a dream-world which she must explore and escape. Accordingly, the movements of the character are very dream-like and slow...contrary to the trailer, which showed her moving at a ""normal"" video game pace. Thus, trying to play this game was almost painful...it's like one of those dreams where you're trying to run but your feet are bogged down like you're trying to swim in a pool full of syrup. Not a pleasant gameplay experience at all.I still tried to stick it out though, until I got to the combat part. I guess I'm just not used to puzzle-related combat styles in games, but, it just wasn't very fun to try to figure out. If you're used to games like that, then this won't be a problem. But it wasn't enjoyable for me at all.The good parts about this game are the music and the graphics. The music is haunting and beautiful, and the graphics are styled to look like a moving watercolor painting you can explore...which is an awesome concept that is stunningly executed in this game. So since that part of the game is so awesome, I really wish the gameplay for this game hadn't been so hard to use. Because if you can't play the game, it doesn't matter how pretty it is to look at and listen to. Unless you just watch playthroughs of it on YouTube. Which is a possibility I guess.			"

												Easy platformer combined with oversimplified jRPG - it would seem there's nothing really outstanding in Child of Light. Except that even if you happen to had this kind of thought when launching game - you forget it seeing this breathtaking fairytale combined with outstanding and totally magical visuals. Also, somehow you even can play this poem, and then you realise that level of simplicity is exactly right for this kind of game: not too easy to be boring, but not too complex to forget about visual and textual part.Translators' work is great, by the way - Russian version seems even more rhytmic and appropriate for a fairytale than English one.

												Now listen here 'Edge' (if indeed that is your real name) what we have here is an entertaining, beautiful to look at, sometimes challenging but very enjoyable to play game. There is no reason (on the grounds of this games merits alone) that you would justifiably give it a 5/10.I grant you it's not got astonishing depth but it is a budget game, and for the price asked this delivers in spades.Cease your evil ways and give this an imparcial and fair review. I suspect there's motives involved.			"

												Child of Light is a very, very pretty game. I adore the art style, the character designs, and how the environments make it feel like I'm traveling through the pages of a beautifully illustrated fairytale similar to the ones I used to read when I was a child.The combat in the game was alright, but I found myself wanting to avoid as much as possible as I progressed. I didn't find it all that fun, probably because I never felt like my character was progressing in any significant way. The skill tree wasn't very exciting (I would always forget to assign points because I didn't care), and using oculi in place of traditional equipment was disappointing, especially when having to switch them around frequently depending on what I was fighting.My biggest complaint with Child of Light, however, was the dialogue. I appreciate what they were trying to do, but I found it very difficult to invest myself in the characters or the story because the rhyming made it hard for me to follow what was going on. It was far too distracting, and eventually I stopped trying to decipher the silliness and button mashed through all the talking.I wanted to love this game and there are things I do love about it. The soundtrack is wonderful, and obviously it's a joy to look at and explore. I just feel that the most important aspects of this game were the ones that let me down the most.Also, the Uplay requirement to play is lame.			"

												Bah.... in this age of technology, I shouldn't need to carefully study my system specs to make sure my system will support the game.   What is this, 1995?   Steam should  automagically verify my specs against game requirements before I click the ""BUY"" button... or even before I add a game to my cart.I'm sure this is a fine game, but not playable on a PC with a Dual Core AMD 2.3 GHZ processor... no matter how powerful your video card is... the game won't even attempt to launch.   A  ""CPU does not meet requirements"" popup kills it.There's also a Uplay connection/account verification you have to go through before the game will even attempt to load. Yuck. Shame on Ubisoft for that.I got it on sale, so I'll keep it for when I upgrade my PC (in a couple years), but come on Steam, seems like a straighforward feature to add (storing systems credentials and then verifying against game requirements before purchase.)

												There's not enough good things to say about this gameFirst off, yes it needs uplay. But for a game like this, they could force me to run uplay, steam, origin, whatever they wanted and I'd still buy it. The story is beautiful in a way that very few other games have come close to. The watercolor art style fits well with the 2D viewpoint. The characters are interesting, the story is fantastic, the controls work well. The fight system is fun to use and requires actual strategy instead of random button mashing or luck. I have honestly no negative things to say about this game. For 15 bucks, I clocked in a playtime of over 7 hours and I've only finished the main story. There's still loads of sidequests and areas to explore. If you haven't played it yet, do it now. Of my entire library, I'm normally critical of most games, but this game falls into the category of 1 in 4 that I actually loved enough to write a positive review of.			"

												I wasn't a big fan of this game, though I've heard that it gets better so I might try playing farther in the future.  In the time I played, I didn't like the gameplay and I didn't like the writing, so there was really nothing there that made me want to continue.  It was really the writing that was the bigger problem for me.  The rhyming dialogue was kind of forced and awkward, imo it would've worked better if they had not tried to rhyme at all.The gameplay wasn't a huge problem, but it was just uninteresting to me.  I'm not a huge fan of turn-based combat to begin with, and it was more tedious than usual in this game.  Also, I tried the local co-op and the second player's role was pretty lame (if you've played Mario Galaxy, it's like the co-op in that game).The positives were the art style and the atmosphere, they were the things that originally drew me to the game.  I love the way the game looks, just didn't love the way it plays.			"

												This game has one of the most wonderful soundtracks I ever heard in a game. Graphics are very unique and dreamlike. It is a very relaxed casual game that takes around 7-8 hours to finish. If the graphics of this game appeals to you and you are not looking for a hardcore game but just to have a nice adventure it is a very solid choice.			"

												Aside from the rhyming becoming cliche after a little while into it, this game is phenominal. The story is fantastic, the characters feel lively in this, to me at least they were actual characters you cared about through their backgrounds. Some allies are timid and fearful while others are strong, yet outcasted. The story really blends everything together well and made me want keep going just so I could see what would happen next. The art style is beautiful, all the characters are flawlessly designed for the setting they're placed within like paintings on a canvas. A lot went behind this game, and I personally believe it paid off. The story's like a page-turner. Sometimes it gets a little slow, sometimes it speeds through and puts the characters in a terrible perdicament, and there're those moments where it's just right-those moments where you lose sense of that fact that it's a game, it feels more like a work of art (totally not referring to the combat, referring to a scene later in the game.). All in all it's worth 15 bucks.			"

												This game is simply awesome, Great visuals, dialogue that has a certain charm to it, strategic turn-based combat and plenty of rewards for exploration. If you like RPG's with turn-based combat, this is a no-brainer, and for $15, damn good value.The day 1 DLC and UPlay will be a turn-off for some people, but they're a non-issue for me personally, the DLC's are mostly aesthetics and just more of the oculi (think of them as sockets as in other RPG's, things you can put on equipment to add attributes to them) that you find plenty of in-game anyway (and get even more of with the UPlay rewards). As for UPlay itself, I've never had an issue with it, but I know some people have, so if UPlay concerns you, you might want to err on the side of caution.Overall, I definitely don't regret buying this, and again, for $15, it really is a steal.

												It pains me to say that the only thing this game really has going for it is that's gorgeous. You can tell by the eclectic cast of characters and the depth of the combat what they were aiming for. Sadly, it totally misses the mark. The dialogue is slow and sparse, with virtually no real development of any of the characters. If I had to sit here and write out all the ways the game bored me I'd end up boring you, poor reader.

Outline, Story/Plot, Conclusiveness:Basic, not too special good/light vs evil/dark story.Rather ordinary plot devices and ""messages"". Like a girl growing up on the hardships of her adventure and taking more and more responsibility and that family, friendship and faith can overcome all - ideas I cannot particularily relate to. I believe they are overused in fictional media, and with this lose their appeal and meaningfulness to me. They probably make up some of the most fundamental aspects of life and I can respect if writers actually believe in this, but sometimes this stuff feels pretentious and a bit uninspiring to me. The ending felt a bit rushed. I didn't expect the game to end as early as it did, even though the rough outline and the ""goal"" was foreseeable and the story found a conclusive, logical ending.Voice Acting, Narration, Writing, Music, Sounds:Almost no voice acting. Only a neutral narrator once in a while. The characters in the game only speak via text. Most narration and text is in verses and rhymes. Sometimes it felt a bit forceful, in other instances it helped to give weight to some of the statements Aurora or her companions were giving. All in all I think they did a great job with this and that it helps to create the ambiance of playing a fairytale. It surely wasn't easy to write all this, I suppose, and still have it make sense. I didn't understand it all, as English isn't my main language and I'm not used to poetry of this kind in any of the languages I speak.Nice music and some interesting sound design (Aurora walks on her bare feet, and you can hear this when she touches the ground; I thought the flapping of her wings sounded nice too).Art/Visual Design, Animation:Beautiful level art (resembling watercolor paintings/aquarelle).Somewhat underwhelming character portrait art (looks a bit like something a nonprofessional would put up on deviantART).Nicely animated protagonist. Aurora moves very smoothly, from what I've seen she is a mix of 2D and 3D. Just as some other main characters. Most other people and creatures look entirely 2D to me, and appear less ""plastic"" as a result. It's not easy to explain but best to look at in trailers or the likes. Combat, Difficulty, Skilling, Platforming/Puzzling, Local Co-Op:Turn-based combat. Very unusual for Western games, it's what you see in Japanese RPGs usually. But even Japanese RPGs often appear overly strategic to me with dozens of units to control on a big grid field, or they put you under stress with real-time elements. Child of Light sticks to more traditional RPGs. You control two characters in combat, and fight a maximum of three enemies in turns. There is a turn priority, and there are means to slow down/speed up combatants to get them make their turns more quickly/slowly. You can exchange your fighters freely once it's their turn, and time your attacks to interrupt your enemies' actions.Normal difficulty was pretty easy. If you handle the turn priority system right you can keep your enemies interrupted most of the time, or you kill them quickly enough before they start dealing more damage. Also, there are three ways of healing people (too many, perhaps): Simultaneously to moving Aurora around in the world and choosing fighting orders in combat you control a firefly spirit. This firefly has an energy bar he can exhaust to light up his surrounding area and by that either heal your fighters or blind/slow down enemies. Most damage I was able to heal with this firefly. I almost never used any consumables (healing potions and the likes), and healing spells rarely when the energy bar of the firefly was exhausted. Was someone still hurt too much I exchanged him or her with another fighter. Towards the end of the game you have like 3-5 fighters to choose from, and I rarely saw the health of any of them turn dangerously low.The game is advertised with ""200 skills"" on one of the trailers. But this is a bit eye-washing. There are many skills, but a significant part of them are passive skills which merely increase the attributes of your fighters and not actually give you something to alter your combat experience with. There is not a particulary lack of active skills - there are numerous fighters, and they all have specific, unique and fitting skills designed towards their character profiles and backgrounds, but there is little freedom in developing the characters as there are only two, at best three ""paths"" to move on the skill trees with no way of branching out. You go path A, path B or path C. Inbetween you may stop going one and walk some you previously ignored, and vice versa, but that's about it. Ultimatively they could have given you two or three perfectly flattened left-to-right skill lines for each character instead of the winded ones you find in this game.There is some platforming and puzzling, but it's not really worth mentioning. Spikes coming out of the walls, a few boxes to push on some buttons to open doors. What is interesting is that you can use the already mentioned firefly to pick up items and open chests. It's glowing light is used in several places to activate buttons, solve riddles based on shadowplay and to get past obstacles. It is a form of ""singleplayer co-op"" as I believe this is called, and interestingly strongens the ties between Aurora and the firefly as her constant companion in an active way really feelable by the player. Apparently a second local human player can control the firefly, which may help feel this tie even more so. There sure is a lot of to do with the firefly, so this local 2-player co-op may be a lot of fun (I didn't try it myself).			"

												Child of Light is simply beautiful.It has a detailed and rich 2D visuals with unique artstyle, with smooth animations.The active-time based strategy allows a variation of strategy and timing, since, aside from just selecting actions, you are able to manipulate your enemies' timer. It was nice and refreshing to play an old-school system with a new twist.The music does the job nicely. It's soothing, dreamy, and fantasy-like. I have to say it reminds me of a mobile rhythm game, Deemo.The story uses the troupe of light vs darkness, it does work on RPGs, and I feel Child of Light hit it quite well.Overall Child of Light is beautiful to watch, fun to play, and it feels like playing a classic RPG.

The combat clearly takes inspiration from classic RPGs such as Final Fantasy, but combines a traditional Active Timer Battle stystem with the ability to alter and interupt the flow of battle, Battles have a layer of complexity not often seen in standard turn-based combat. The protagonist may be a mere child, but this game is a fully fledged experience sure to leave an impression!9/10			"

												This game is a masterpiece. There is so much detail put into the game in regards to art and gameplay. Even in the very beginning, I noticed various hidden locations that can expound on the gameplay or lore as a whole. Although I've only played this for a solid hour, I can assure you that this game is wonderful. I fully recommend it.The gameplay is very simple from the beginning, and the turn-based battle system is flawless. I enjoy the various strategies I can take in order to attack my opponents faster, defend myself, prevent myself from being interrupted, and etcetera.The artistic side of the game is perhaps the reason why I first took a look at this game. I don't think I can say much about the artwork other than 'Just check it out. This game is beautiful'.Finally, the lore. My God, if you love poetry and a beautiful, enthralling, story-telling game, you are probably in heaven now. The story, so far, is amazing. I anticipate great things when I continue to play it.Child of Light is a 2.5D sidescrolling RPG adventure that follows the story of Aurora when she awakens in the land of Lemuria. The game is beautiful, the gameplay is simple and functional, and the story is fascinating. From the looks of things, this game is a MUST GET. For jut $14.99... there shouldn't be much of a reason why you wouldn't be able to buy Child of Light.			"

												What an enchanting game. It feels like a fairy tale with rpg elements. Like a well illustrated children's storybook come to life in video game form. RPG combat system is classic with a few updates. A lot of the tactical element of the game centers around altering how quickly you or your enemies can attack. If you can attack your enemy when their initiative meter gets into the red zone, you can interrupt them potentially setting them back an entire turn. And you have multiple options for affecting that timing. While your attacks are turn based, you have a fairy companion controlled separately by the mouse who can heal you, or slow down your enemies and operates in real time.  Out of combat this same companion can interact with objects on the map that Aurora can't reach in a variety of ways allowing two people to play, one operating Aurora with the keyboard and the other controlling the fairy with the mouse The trailers do a pretty good job of letting you know what you're in for and the beauty and grandeur of it all holds up throughout the game. Its proof that you can have a beautiful game without demanding that your video card spit out the maximum number of polygons and photorealistic textures and next gen lighting effects. As shown here, with some actual art direction, you can do so much more with so much less. The story is a basic coming of age tale combined with a heroes journey. Young Princess Aurora seemingly dies in bed only to wake up in a strange new land. Able to see haunting visions of her own father falling ill from grief as he mourns her passing, she must explore her new world and try to find her way home while making friends and enemies along the way. One annoying thing was the decision to write the game in rhyming couplets. I know that this was done to hold with the storybook fairy tale conceit but it started to wear thin for me rather quickly and had me wishing that they'd just speak plainly. But I am a childless 35 year old man (what are you looking at me for? Maybe I want a change of pace from the high octane AAA experience every now and then), so your mileage may vary. I've seen plenty of comments both ways from other people. I will say that if you find the dialog annoying, its usually not terribly essential to read all of it apart from getting side quests and there's not a huge amount of it anyway. The soundtrack and the art still make for a plenty beautiful experience even if the dialog doesn't work for you and the gameplay should be plenty fun for any fan of classic rpg gameplay. But other than that, everything about this game was great. Nice change of pace too. And again speaking as a childless 35 year old man, I found that it didn't get to ""twee"" for me, so if that was a concern for you, don't worry. Its also a short game for those of you who have lives.			"

But I am a childless 35 year old man (what are you looking at me for? Maybe I want a change of pace from the high octane AAA experience every now and then), so your mileage may vary. I've seen plenty of comments both ways from other people. I will say that if you find the dialog annoying, its usually not terribly essential to read all of it apart from getting side quests and there's not a huge amount of it anyway. The soundtrack and the art still make for a plenty beautiful experience even if the dialog doesn't work for you and the gameplay should be plenty fun for any fan of classic rpg gameplay. But other than that, everything about this game was great. Nice change of pace too. And again speaking as a childless 35 year old man, I found that it didn't get to ""twee"" for me, so if that was a concern for you, don't worry. Its also a short game for those of you who have lives.			"

												The game is gorgeous and the music is haunting and wonderful. The mechanics of gameplay are smooth and intuitive and the combat system is simple but engaging and capable of punishing you for not paying close enough attention to it. If only it weren't for that pesky Uplay that crashes your game when some server goes down or just might not let you play...It'd be a shame to miss this one, but it would also be understandable if you don't like installing malware like Uplay or Origin on your rig.

												Beautiful and with a fun battle system, however do not buy unless you can tolerate Ubisoft's bull crap.  They force Uplay onto your system, the game has plenty of frustrating bugs that seem like they happen with no rhyme or reason, and the rhyme speech that pervades the game wears out its charm after five minutes and quickly becomes tiresome.  Not a bad game, I just wish that Ubisoft hadn't made it.  Wouldn't have bought this if i knew it had egregious DRM BS.			"

												It's through UPlay.... and it sucks. No support from them at all.I reached chapter 6 and after I finished a fight I was shocked to see that the game took me back to the start of the Chapter 1. Seriously! That's 19 hours of gameplay, whoosh! Gone!My first impression was that I could reload from the saved game. Guess what... that is gone too.I checked online and the corrupt or lost saved games is pretty common issue. Yet if you go to UPlay support there is no mention of this issue at all. I'm not sure how the sync to the cloud works as well with regards to UPlay, but I don''t see any option to use the cloud sync to start from the previous location, neither on Steam nor on Uplay.It sucks to be in such a situation. I don't plan to go through the whole game again. It is just too frustrating.			"

												**CANNOT RECOMMEND DUE TO UPLAY REQUIREMENTS**This game is gorgeous, and I was quite attracted to the artistic style of the game and the themes of its story.  However, the turn-based RPG combat felt trite and out of place given the rest of the game experience.  It was also disappointing that grinding through these combat encounters was frequently the only means of story progression.  The artistry of the world is no mean feat, but the game play was not particularly unique or innovative and the story lost much of its thematic power through experience grinds and interruptions announcing Uplay unlock/ achievement events.Had I noticed this required a continuously-connected Uplay account, I simply would not have made the purchase.  I like the game, but I just don't play it because of the hassle involved.  Logging into both Steam and Uplay back to back, and being unable to access a single-player game for which I have already paid whenever the internet is wonky, is absolute rubbish.  I am disappointed that Steam is offering games with this type of DRM and promoting them with sales.			"

												This is likely my GOTY of 2014. One of the best RPGs I've ever played! The battle system is so addicting and fun. The game makes it very easy to avoid enemy encounters, but you'll find yourself wanting to intentionally confront enemies all the time, because the battles are just that fun. The characters are all really unique and charming, especially your party members. The game doesn't rehash or copy beaten-to-death cliches from RPGs of the past. It really goes out of its way to forge its own identity, making it feel really fresh and new. The visuals and music are absolutely stunning and incredibly memorable. I applaud Ubisoft for giving us this masterpiece!			"

												An absolutely beautiful game, that was an absolute pleasure to play. Almost everything was perfect about it: the artstyle, the music, the battle system, the fact that Caroline Dhavernas from Wonderfalls is the narrator. The only downside to it is the fact that the party system is only built for two characters, and there are so many characters to use, you don't bother switching them out and will stick with your mains. That, however, is a minor problem, and does hinger this wonderful game in any way. Please, Ubisoft, more heartfelt video games like this, and less heartless dross like Assassins Creed			"

												Awesome Game. You can see how much work actually went in to creating the atmosphere of the game. The combat system isn't anything revelutionary, but it works and is engaging. Story is well thought out but a little short. The only minus to the game is the oculus crafting system is pretty simple and doesn't add much, and the leveling system is very limited: no real opportunity for min/max any characters. However, if your into rpg's which beautiful atmospheres, and a compelling story Child of Light is definitely worth checking out.			"

												Child of Light is a touching story that builds a quick attachment to the protagonist, a young girl named, Aurora.  A faux princess, so she thinks, Aurora gains comapnions who quickly become friends through battle and snippets of interaction between scenes that include Aurora and the companions but also conversation between the others themselves that will make you laugh.  The game at it's core is medium paced and though the battle is turn based, the interupt tactics and skill builds quickly make battle fun and engaging.  Storyline is phenominal if only because it pulls at your heartstrings; especially if you are a female gamer, like myself, who can identify with her relationship with her father.  Every little girl who has a good Dada will find this game a tear jerker if only due to the fact Aurora never gives up solely because her father needs her and as the story progresses, the confidence with which she uses to move forward to get home to her father begins to coalesce with the needs of the people of this world consumed by the night.  Aurora is a wonderful lead and in hand with the game mechanics (flying being one of my favorite aspects), the companions that keep you laughing and the relatable paternal relationship make Child of Light a thoroughly enjoyable game that I suggest everyone give a try!

												One of the most endearing game I have played in the last year, Child of Light brings you into a fairytale world with its unique look inspired by watercolor paintings of the 19th century, and its funny dialogue, all in rhyme. The characters are unique and interesting, with their own personality.The music, always an important part of a game for me, is sad and heroic at the same time; I enjoyed it so much I actually bought the soundtrack.Aurora, the heroine, is an endearing character, a child who grows as you guide her through the story. I loved just watching her hair flow around in the wind as you fly around looking for hidden chests or monsters. She's kind, courageous, and grows as the story progresses.I love stories and games with female protagonists, and this does not disappoint, an excellent example that games featuring strong women in leading roles can be great. Aurora is a very good role-model for young gamers.The gameplay was a bit easy and rather simple, but then I'm a veteran of this kind of game for 30 years. Still I found the combat system enjoyable overall. The real gems in this game are the exploration, the dialogue and the story.			"

Water colour pastel artwork is amazing, similar to a JRPG style however, i would not go as far to say it is a JRPG. The story is suppose to be a child’s story, they stay true to that through the entire game, i found parts of the story a bit to childish for their suspected target audience.As a note after the final boss the game brings you back before the battle so you can complete any sides quest or items you did not locate, however as it stands the reply value is minimal. Overall for the price of the game you would regret passing this if anything above intrigued you. 7/10			"

												The turned-based style of battle makes this game's battles a bit long, but each second matters. As the story progresses, you come to love each one of them. Aurora is such a fun girl to get to play as and to get to see her go from child, to teenager, to princess, it made me love her even more. Each side-character has a certain style of fighting. Some of them heal, others cure status ailments, some are much stronger than Aurora. The oculi and Igniclus' glow can drastically change the outcome of the fight. It's very slow going though until you get your wings, as Aurora is a little girl and runs in little strides. Other than that it's an amazing game! I suggest playing it!			"

												A fun title that could have been more. First, the positives: the art work is beautiful; really stunning watercolour design. Second, the music, whilst the tunes get very familiar, they're also pretty easy on the ears too. You'll find yourself humming along before long. The gameplay is surprisingly challenging. I reccommend playing on 'gamer' mode to properly experience Child of Light. There's a nice skill tree available to each character and the AI does not play nice. I'll readily admit I died a few times in this game.On the 'less' positive side is the story. It's very simplistic, unfortunately so. The real meat of the story is hidden away in difficult to locate 'diary entries'. There's a lot that could have been done to flesh out characters. The game script gets a little tedious also. The nusery rhyme style, whilst cute to a point, can make reading a little frustrating, especially when trying to decipher the aforementioned diary entries. 3 1/2 stars.			"

												""The path home, tragic and fate.  Beware the night.   Child of Light."" A game full of adventure and mystery, set out for you to write its history. Storytelling told, never to forget. Characters with memorable expressions and souls. Let Lemuria be a place to remember now and then. For you have a role, that must unfold. This is poetry inspired by the game itself. You see what beauty it can bring? Ideas that spring, from a game of pure beauty. I am not the one making the choice to buy the game, A story must be told. . .but that depends on who looks at it which way. I have an adventure to continue back in the kingdom of Lemuria where characters, music, and battles are never forgotten. So I will leave this up to you, whether or not it stays. Take this recommendation, but not forcefully. . .for this is a matter of opinion, and an enjoyable thing to write for me.Child of Light, a game for some, and a journey. Awaiting without refuge some say.			"

												Ok so I just finished playing Child of Light!!! I enjoyed it tremendously. The aesthetics are magnificient (not to mention the poetry, seriously), the music gorgeous, the battle system, the oculi and the whole mechanics using Igniculus are just wonderful, I had not seen something like that before, I think it was very creative. Oh, and a felame protagonist. I must always mention that. Now, about the difficulty: I played in normal, and didn't find it difficult in the least. It wasn't a breeze, but with a bit of grinding I found the pace great, letting you relax through the game without becoming bored. Just a thing more, all this is coming from someone who suffers fybromialgia, and I must say that this game was a blessing, since because of the fog that comes with the illness I have been less and less able to play any kind of game, and being able to thorougly enjoy this one was a more than welcome change. I can't stress enough how happy I am for being able to play something as awesome as this again, but maybe I am a bit biased because of that.I was a bit worried after buying it because all the hate on Uplay, but honestly, I don't see it as bad, it didn't bother me at all, didn't disconect once (and let it be known that my internet competes for the worst internet in the world), and it had the Uplay win thing, that had some rad things. I'm off to play the NG+ now! ;)			"

												A deep, in-depth experience for lovers of both turn based RPGs and metroid-vania style exploration games.  Designed in a such a way, however, that its very accessible to people who have trouble getting into games.  Case in point, my non-gamer girlfriend is in love with this game.  And with the co-op light (not a true co-op experience) the second player (me) can help the first player by healing, blinding enemies, and more.  It's a really interesting mechanic to adjust the difficulty without physically asking the game to be easy.Its rare to see a 2D platforming turn based RPG and this game pulls it off really well.  Also with the same engine as Rayman Origins and Legends, the game is beautiful and runs very well.  You definitely get your money's worth at full price, I hope this isn't the last we hear from this series.  Or, at least this style of game.			"

The combat system is pretty fun and dynamic, it's not just about choosing the right attacks and knowing what to do, but you can interact real-time between turns to turn the tides to your favor. This game is a 10/10 and anyone who likes RPGs should play it. And the rhymes just make the meaning of the characters' words' more powerful.			"

												Never would I have thought that steam could tell bedtime stories. If nothing else, the visuals are enough to take your breath away. the watercolor painting inspired artwork and fanatstical setting really sets the fairytale spirit of the game. However, you cant make a god narritive with pretty visuals alone, there has to be a gripping story and well one telling of it. The story is reminiscent of the classic fairy tale stories we heard as kids; it has a princess, a witch, magic, strange creatures, and a hero. Luckily it has enough original ideas to be far from cliche. The gameplay is very well done too. It's combat system is second to none and the puzzles will keep your brain working throughout the game without feeling like its just solvig the same simple puzzle over and over.  For the icing on the cake, we have the music. Written by Candian artist, Coeur de Pirate, it really sets the mood of the game. the dreamy piano gives it that bedtime story feeling, and the orchestral parts really emphasize the fantastic landscape and intense battle. If I could just sum this up, I would say it's a simple and intelligent game.			"

												They said they were inspired by Chrono Trigger and Finaly Fantasy 6, two of my favorite games, and it shows. The battle system is simple but fun, and it forces you to pay attention. I love the idea of being able to fly anywhere too. I really enjoyed it. However, the dialogue is terrible. The idea is to have every single line rhyme, which is ok in theory, but it is written really badly. After every single battle most of your party levels up, which detracts from the feeling of accomplishment. I was level 47 when I realized that I didn't level up after a battle. The animation and art style is beautiful, but I didn't really like the character artwork at all. The music is really nice, but relies heavily on one theme. It's a charming little RPG with a lot of flaws, but if you overlook them, it is a lot of fun and captures the sort of imaginative world feel that video games used to have.			"

												If you like turn-based RPGs like FF7 you might like Child of Light. I think it's a little short for a $15 game though. It takes about 15 hours on normal and 20 hours on hard to complete. And the ending was supposedly rushed. Other than that its a great game.			"

												This game is very pretty, I haven't played that much of it yet but just the water colours are amazing. Though personally, I find the main girls hair to be very out of place, but it still looks great. The controls are smooth, though for me it was hard to get used to pressing the up arrow or W to jump instead of the space bar. So far the storyline is great, as I stated before, i am not that far into the game. I was really looking forward to this game, and it has not disapointed me.			"

												CoL is innocative and interesting. In a genre that has some puzzle solving one would normally see real time combat CoL chooses to use an interesting twist on turn based RPG combat. There are still stats that decided damage, weakness, and resistance like one would assume, but there is also manipulation of attack order and the ability to time attacks correctly to interrupt an enemy attack.The art is inspiring and colorful, and the characters are unique and compelling. There is enough action between the dialouge that is doesn't feel heavy, but there is enough dialouge to guide an interesting story that fits the genre of bed time fairy tales. ""A little girl chosen as a child of light to fight a queen of darkness and reclaim a lost land"", that sort of thing.As for UPlay its not a perfect system, its annoying to have to run there program in addition to steam, in addition to the game itself, but I hadn't used my account with them since playing Far Cry 3 on PS3 about two years ago, and I had no trouble recovering my account and playing the game.Great game, reasonable price, you won't be disappointed with this addition to your steam library.

												I am really enjoying this game. I had to buy it for my PS3 because my PC is a little old, but it was worth buying twice. The environments are amazing and I enjoy the poetry aspect of the dialog. If you are a fan of JRPGs then there is a good bet you will like Child of Light. I do recommend getting the Golem's Plight pack. Golem is a great addition to the team, and his quest is in the beginning of the game, so it is best to get that DLC when you start the game.			"

												Just started out and love it. This game is clearly some dev's love-child not just some assembly line product like Ubi's AC series. Something unique and personal like a bedtime-tale told to you as a youngling.Dark and melancholic atmosphere feels like kids-friendly Dark Souls with some similarities story-wise -lol. Maps looks light-metroidvania but I'm not too far in to judge. Some riddles though easy so far. Reached the first boss - cool design. Difficulty on hard setting is decent, very easy on normal setting. Dual-stick-controller highly recommended.Pretty graphics look hand-painted and fit the mood, some won't like it but the majority probably will.The same with the soundtrack, very memorable. Deep story so far, I'm really anxious for the ending.Battles play out as cross between Final Fantasy-ATB and Grandia. When the time bar is full you can act with some delay. If you're hit within the action-delay the action gets cancelled. And if the enemy is about to attack you should probably block which also fills your next gauge faster. Definitely buy if you like j-RPGs, pretty stuff and melancholy.I really don't agree with the day 1-DLCs, Uplay or the Ubi-staff posting like us gamers on the forum anon but will not go in detail here as the discussion is already been held elsewhere. Just saying: if it gets games like this gettjng made for 15 bucks it excuses a lot of things and if you don't like Ubi, just get this game then boycott the next 50$/€ AC next time to ease your consciousness. :)Also the DLCs don't seem essential to enjoy the game, it's just to extract some more coins from the rich kiddies.

												The game is very simple - just telling you story which is very nice. Atmosphere and picture - beyond praise. A little minus is battles as once you understand the way you should act - they all become pretty the same.I will definitely recommend this game for those you like casual, touching games (like myself)			"

The colors are beautiful.A lot of the detail in your surroundings and backgrounds are simply gorgeous and breathtaking.I feel like I'm reading a children's story book, it's fantastic! The music is very nice as well, it gives you a more emotional tie with Aurora.(At least that's how it makes me feel :P) You can definitely feel for Aurora and her desperation.Pretty intense combat and boss fights, especially fighting multiple foes. I love the effects of a lot of the abilities for Aurora and her companions.You have the Oculi system as well where you can craft your gems to equipt with you and your party to boost your stats or add elemental effects to your attacks.Plus you have the help of an adorable Firefly named Igniculus who aids ingiving you mana/health and collecting items for you as well as slowing your enemies in battleand he is in your control!This game has a very nice story line and its well worth the price. *thumbs up*			"

												A side-scrolling RPG, Child of Light combines elements of everything from Limbo to Final Fantasy into a gorgeously drawn, well executed fairytale.It's a peaceful game, and enjoyable to play through, withy lots fo goodies to hunt down.I did find that on standard difficulty it was too easy, but once you get to New Game+ the stakes raise a little, which makes some of the abttles more challenging.A good game for the more novice gamer, and those more interested in the story than the battle system, though I don't at all regret putting the time in to play through. It's not intended to be hardcore gaming, it's intended to be poignant and heartfelt - and it really, really is.			"

The graphics are beautiful, the battle system is fun, and the story is excellent.The only minor downside to this game is the dialogue can be a bit silly at times... I'm not a huge fan of all of the rhyming but it does have a certain charm!			"

												bought this game, cause i liked the controlls in in the demo.but got way more than I aspected. nice storyline, beautiful artwork and perfect soundtracks !i think you can finish this game in like 6-8 hours (if you hurry), but i recommend enjoying this game in every detail.it has an interesting fighting and level system, which allows you to define your playstyle. also there is a crafting system for gems you collect in the game.-love it !

												Absolutely beautiful. Child of Light has reminded me of why I became enchanted with video games almost 26 years ago. A simplistic yet touching story told completlely in verse. Graphically I was constantly impressed.....attention to detail is key. Watch Aurora's hair when she's in flight.The combat system is remeniscent of the FF universe is surprisingly complex - dancing your characters around to maximise potential is key.Don't play it on normal, game is far too easy for that.

												The art is beautiful, the verse is easy to read and makes the dialog entertaining by itself. The characters, spells, monsters, and story are well thought out and you love all your characters immediately. The combat system is a good blend of turn-based and real-time. It's difficult without making me curse...too often. There are chances to skip on battles but I fought all of them that I found and never had the need to grind levels. The only criticism I have is that you can only use two of your amazing characters at a time, but since you only face a maximum of three enemies it is understandable.			"

It does get a bit slow and repetitive in the last few hours of the game but the experience is great and the price is right.			"

												Child of Light is a great story with BEAUTIFUL graphics and artwork!There ..... i just summed it up in one sentence ..... but if that wasn't enough to convince you, I'll go ahead and go into a little more detail.Story: As i said it's an awesome story.  You play as a ""princess"" who has been poisoned and wakes up in another world.  You're main gold is to return to YOUR world to save your father who has become deathly ill with grief over your ""death"".  One thing that is very different but i thought was nice was that all the dialogue between the characters and the narrator were done in poem/balad type format.  So yes, it all rhymed lol.  I suppose you could say it added to the ""Immersion"" factor in the sense that people don't really TALK like that anymore.Graphics: Lovely hand-drawn backgrounds and characters.Gameplay: Child of Light is built upon the framework of a classic turn-based RPG, but also uses the often seen ""Move bar"", making combat slightly more dynamic and interactive than just ""pick move, use move"".  Using your little firefly elemental you can slow down enemies to make your moves go first or fall in just the right place on the move bar to be most effective.The skill trees for all the characters are EXPANSIVE but simplistic at the same time.  You can look ahead and see where you are going so you can plan out exactly what you want the character to do for your group, whether more damage focused or control or healing.  Each character (and there are several you will unlock during your journey) has primarily 3 skill trees that expand after you recover the moon in the game.  Most skills cost only one skill point which you get each time you gain a level and once you get the expansion some of the advance skills cost 2 points.  You gain levels fairly quickly and even if you don't use a character in battle it still levels up with the whole party.  I finished with most of my characters being low to high 40s.After the initial ""tutorial"" area, and you unlock your flight ability, navigating the world becomes a breeze.  The controls to fly and control that flight are simple and intuitive.  You really get the sense of freedom as you explore every nook and cranny for hidden secrets and chests.I think I've said enough.  If i haven't convinced you to give this game a play by now then nothing more i say is going to make a difference.This game is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!Happy Gaming Guys...			"

												This is quite the good game. The art style is fantastic, the story line is interesting, and the combat system is amazing. While this game does suffer a bit from its some what forced rhyming dialouge and a short and somewhat choppy story, that shouldn't stop you from trying it out. If you like old style RPG's this is definately the game for you. With a good difficulty level and fantastic visuals, this game is worth a try.I completeded the main story in around 12-13 hours total while doing the majority of the side quests, and I have also started my new game+ file which is a great addition as it allows you to carry over all of your levels, equipment, stats, and skills while amping up the difficulty enough to still be challenging.I highly recommended this game.

												Child of Light is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen; with its unique art style to the beautiful soundtrack, everything about this game is stunning. The combat is simple and reminds me of Final Fantasy, and the number of possible attacks are inclredible, especially when seeing a lot of your allies' attacks and just how powerful and useful they can be. I highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good interactive sidescroller with amazing scenery and super creative enemy designs, all with certain weaknesses and strong points.			"

												Child of Light is a visually stunning game. Ubisoft pulled out all the stops creating this adorable turn-based RPG. The entire game looks painted onto the screen and the music and immersive story help you fully engage in the story. Although it doesn't look like it, you can fully explore the world around you. The side-quests are fun and challenging, the characters are rich in personality and life, and gaining more party members, skills,and crafting occuli creates an immense sense of accomplishment within the game. Being up to change party members during battle and use them immediately to attack is extremely helpful! Slowing down enemies is also a neat trick to do if one of your moves takes a longer time to ""charge up"". Anyone who enjoys a good story and turn based combat will love Child of Light!			"

The colors are beautiful.A lot of the detail in your surroundings and backgrounds are simply gorgeous and breathtaking.I feel like I'm reading a children's story book, it's fantastic! The music is very nice as well, it gives you a more emotional tie with Aurora.(At least that's how it makes me feel :P) You can definitely feel for Aurora and her desperation.Pretty intense combat and boss fights, especially fighting multiple foes. I love the effects of a lot of the abilities for Aurora and her companions.You have the Oculi system as well where you can craft your gems to equipt with you and your party to boost your stats or add elemental effects to your attacks.Plus you have the help of an adorable Firefly named Igniculus who aids ingiving you mana/health and collecting items for you as well as slowing your enemies in battleand he is in your control!This game has a very nice story line and its well worth the price. *thumbs up*			"

												A side-scrolling RPG, Child of Light combines elements of everything from Limbo to Final Fantasy into a gorgeously drawn, well executed fairytale.It's a peaceful game, and enjoyable to play through, withy lots fo goodies to hunt down.I did find that on standard difficulty it was too easy, but once you get to New Game+ the stakes raise a little, which makes some of the abttles more challenging.A good game for the more novice gamer, and those more interested in the story than the battle system, though I don't at all regret putting the time in to play through. It's not intended to be hardcore gaming, it's intended to be poignant and heartfelt - and it really, really is.			"

												Child of Light was a pretty good game on an aesthetic level. (I’d actually go as far as to say that it was a very aesthetic experience).It had great sound design, pleasant music, and wonderful art.Probably the only thing it fell short on for me was the story, which was intriguing but became a little disjointed and didn’t pay off in the end. And the characters, who all had potential but got no real development.Well also, I could have done without the horrible rhyming. It actually made it really hard to understand some of the dialogue. (Although I have to admit for a while when it was making fun of a characters inability to rhyme , it was rather amusing)I hope to see some more games like this in the future, it was pretty refreshing in many ways. And oddly gratifying that it had so many different female characters. I don’t generally care about or notice gender, but in this case I did, and it was actually rather empowering.			"

Open ended tasks were you have no idea of where they came from, it is all very like a trippy. Battling is interactive and keeps your finger on the mouse always trying to stay ahead.

Aurora is an adorable red headed princess lost in a magical with giant spiders, ghosts and hosts of other creatures. In her journey to save her father, she makes new friends and matures at first mentally- then physically. This game has a lot of great elements to it and more work was put into presentation than mechanics.

The only problem is there is not much to do afterwards so this game will only occupy around ~15 hours of your time.			"

												Child of Light is one of the emotional RPG turn based I've ever played. The graphic on 3D model character is acceptable but the most stunning is those 2D water color elements in this game!Bosses and Monsters in this game are quite challange interm of timing and abilities since it's timing RPG.For those who seek the 2DRPG game, I highly recommend this game!

												This game is simply  beautiful from the Art to the Music to the the Gameplay i just can't get enough of the little effects they added in. The moment i started the game I just knew i was going to enjoy it. The characters are very simple but thats what makes them believable. The gameplay is very easy to learn (if you're looking for a challenge play on hard) each character has a unique move set and the oculus system is a nice way to give you the edge in a battle. The story even being really simple is really gripping.Art: 10 - style is like watching a painting moveMusic: 8 - the music sets the mood  at every turnStory: 8 - fairy tale tropes and some dark elementsCharacter Design: 9 - the characters have a very “Where the Wild Things Are” feel to themGameplay: 9 - Very simple and easy to learn but hard to master (on hard mode at least)Overall: 9/10 - I highly recommend this game to anyone			"

												This game deserves a much higher meta score than it got, especially for just being a small side project.It is one of the few Turn based RPG's that you will actually see out there.  That in itself gives it a lot of props.The gaming industry has all but completely shunned turned based rpgs and it is a shame, they are what built the industry initially and they are still amazingly fun games to play.This is a fairy tail game.  It's cute, slightly dark at times, and reminds me of a deep nursery rhyme.  It's fantastic.  The music is simply amazing and the artistic design is to be commended.  It is a great play through with a lot of replay value.I highly suggest this game.  For any classic RPG lover, this satisfies what you've been missing this last decade since the great Suikodens and FF's before their downfall.  Give it a chance, you won't find the modern day square enix movie games, but you'll actually get fun gameplay and a heart warming story...more than they are capable of offering anymore.			"

												The art is beautiful, the verse is easy to read and makes the dialog entertaining by itself. The characters, spells, monsters, and story are well thought out and you love all your characters immediately. The combat system is a good blend of turn-based and real-time. It's difficult without making me curse...too often. There are chances to skip on battles but I fought all of them that I found and never had the need to grind levels. The only criticism I have is that you can only use two of your amazing characters at a time, but since you only face a maximum of three enemies it is understandable.			"

												although the story is somewhat generic the game is beautifully executed. it looks marvellous, the characters are charming, and the soundtrack (which will get stuck in your head) creates an epic ambience. also, a lot of thought has been put in the game mechanics and the combination of tactictal and real time elements make the fights good fun (and on hard even challenging for non-RPG-enthusiasts). obviously there's not much of an item craze going on like in other RPGs. however, it is a lot of fun tuning the group's abilities and gems.

												This game is abesolutely fabulous, not just because of it's water color-style graphics. It has a very unique story line along that follows the dark grim fairy tales that we hear about. The game play is much similar to the Final Fantasy Series as far as character-group combat in game which this game also requires a bit of strategy within combat which allow for a nice challenge.The game also has really good character development for the main character Aurora quiet literally taken in game. Overall this game is definately one of the best Adventure-Rpg's I've played in a long time. Not to mention it has a fantastic music soundtrack which is definate scores some kudos points with me. Anyways definately reccommend trying it out and hitting it up when it goes on sale. Well worth the price.			"

												Child of Light is a visually stunning game. Ubisoft pulled out all the stops creating this adorable turn-based RPG. The entire game looks painted onto the screen and the music and immersive story help you fully engage in the story. Although it doesn't look like it, you can fully explore the world around you. The side-quests are fun and challenging, the characters are rich in personality and life, and gaining more party members, skills,and crafting occuli creates an immense sense of accomplishment within the game. Being up to change party members during battle and use them immediately to attack is extremely helpful! Slowing down enemies is also a neat trick to do if one of your moves takes a longer time to ""charge up"". Anyone who enjoys a good story and turn based combat will love Child of Light!			"

												I did enjoy playing this game, the story was good although for all the hype i excepted it to great. the combat was actually fairly enjoyable as well, however it really has a damage vs health issue where in boss fights the main character could die in one round. the crafting system is super simplistic as uses the closest thing this game has to an inventory system. you craft gems that increase your stats or damage however to get upgrades it take 3x as many gems to upgrade, hence i didnt see a way to give all of my characters upper tier gems. i found that your main character is much better with just magic, so i found myself ignoring melee near the end. So the four main things wrong with this game are that the crafting system seems pretty pointless as you will never have enough gems to do any real meaningful beyond the main character, the combat system has a damage vs health issue, and mana doesnt really need to be managed that well after the first half of them game as the skill costs dont really increase at the same rate as increased in mana, and you have to run the game through uplay(which stopped giving me achievements randomly so to unlock them again i would have to play though again and hope that it didnt happen again, but whatever achievements dont matter).

												It's a good game in the JRPG style without the Japenese elements to it (anime, hyperbole, etc.).  Though the ending felt a bit rushed, the game was enjoyable throughout.  There are a lot of ways to approach battles, many different tactics depending on which characters to want to use, so there may be some replayability for those endeavoring to experiment.  Character progression relies on players making choices of which stats to boost and which abilities to learn, which I think is a great mechanic that many modern JRPGs have gotten away from.  You can level these characters to suit your style, and you're not just filling spheres on a skill tree without branches.The rhyming dialogue is interesting, bouncing between clever and annoying at times, but overall I think it's a success.  I'd recommend for anyone who enjoys RPGs with turn-based battles.  It's not a very difficult game, and there's plenty of side stuff to do if you go looking for it.			"

												A fun title that could have been more. First, the positives: the art work is beautiful; really stunning watercolour design. Second, the music, whilst the tunes get very familiar, they're also pretty easy on the ears too. You'll find yourself humming along before long. The gameplay is surprisingly challenging. I reccommend playing on 'gamer' mode to properly experience Child of Light. There's a nice skill tree available to each character and the AI does not play nice. I'll readily admit I died a few times in this game.On the 'less' positive side is the story. It's very simplistic, unfortunately so. The real meat of the story is hidden away in difficult to locate 'diary entries'. There's a lot that could have been done to flesh out characters. The game script gets a little tedious also. The nusery rhyme style, whilst cute to a point, can make reading a little frustrating, especially when trying to decipher the aforementioned diary entries. 3 1/2 stars.			"

												Ok so I just finished playing Child of Light!!! I enjoyed it tremendously. The aesthetics are magnificient (not to mention the poetry, seriously), the music gorgeous, the battle system, the oculi and the whole mechanics using Igniculus are just wonderful, I had not seen something like that before, I think it was very creative. Oh, and a felame protagonist. I must always mention that. Now, about the difficulty: I played in normal, and didn't find it difficult in the least. It wasn't a breeze, but with a bit of grinding I found the pace great, letting you relax through the game without becoming bored. Just a thing more, all this is coming from someone who suffers fybromialgia, and I must say that this game was a blessing, since because of the fog that comes with the illness I have been less and less able to play any kind of game, and being able to thorougly enjoy this one was a more than welcome change. I can't stress enough how happy I am for being able to play something as awesome as this again, but maybe I am a bit biased because of that.I was a bit worried after buying it because all the hate on Uplay, but honestly, I don't see it as bad, it didn't bother me at all, didn't disconect once (and let it be known that my internet competes for the worst internet in the world), and it had the Uplay win thing, that had some rad things. I'm off to play the NG+ now! ;)			"

												One of the most endearing game I have played in the last year, Child of Light brings you into a fairytale world with its unique look inspired by watercolor paintings of the 19th century, and its funny dialogue, all in rhyme. The characters are unique and interesting, with their own personality.The music, always an important part of a game for me, is sad and heroic at the same time; I enjoyed it so much I actually bought the soundtrack.Aurora, the heroine, is an endearing character, a child who grows as you guide her through the story. I loved just watching her hair flow around in the wind as you fly around looking for hidden chests or monsters. She's kind, courageous, and grows as the story progresses.I love stories and games with female protagonists, and this does not disappoint, an excellent example that games featuring strong women in leading roles can be great. Aurora is a very good role-model for young gamers.The gameplay was a bit easy and rather simple, but then I'm a veteran of this kind of game for 30 years. Still I found the combat system enjoyable overall. The real gems in this game are the exploration, the dialogue and the story.			"

The story is suppose to be a child’s story, they stay true to that through the entire game, i found parts of the story a bit to childish for their suspected target audience.As a note after the final boss the game brings you back before the battle so you can complete any sides quest or items you did not locate, however as it stands the reply value is minimal. Overall for the price of the game you would regret passing this if anything above intrigued you. 7/10			"

												I am seriously in awe of the artwork and styling of this game.  As someone who has been a gamer since the early 80's, I don't say that lightly.  The music and color pallete are simply stunning, and the gameplay is remarkably deep and strategic.  It is peaceful and engaging, all at the same time.  It's not a quick-paced game, nor should it be.  Just get it.  Child of Light is a unique gem in a field of generic games.			"

												Not a difficult game (if you're looking for a challenging RPG, this won't be it), but a wonderful game nonetheless. A lovely coming-of-age tale, with moments of joy & sadness. The incessant rhyming dialogue can be stilted & a bit much sometimes, but mostly this is a really enjoyable, heartfelt fairytale with interesting characters, a world worth exploring, and a strong story.

												I'm really enjoying this game. It's seriously beatiful to look at and to listen to. The battle system is a throwback in a nice way to a nostalgic age (for me, anyway). I have a small rant here about the writing: the game is billed as poetry; it's not. The lines rhyme (poorly), but that doesn't make it poetry. The writer has no sense of rhythm nor measure, and a great many of the 'rhymes' reach so far they dislocate their shoulders. If you call the writing poetry, it's complete crap. But as a story told nursery-rhyme style, it's not bad. It's a coming of age story, and I like those.I highly recommend the game. I've missed having real RPGs in the current age of FPS/RPG/MMO/Puzzle/anything-else-we-can-shoe-horn-in-to-maybe-get-another-market games. This definitely qualifies.			"

												As long as I can remember I've always wanted to play a game that allowed me to experience the joy of flying. I don't mean rocket propelled flight a la Dark Void but that more graceful, quieter flight. More Superman Returns less Man of Steel. This is the first and only game that has done it right and for that it will remain one of my most cherished video game gems next to Psychonauts, Beyond Good and Evil, Remember Me, Enslaved and a few others. Highly recommended.			"

												Pros: pretty, centered around girls and women, musicCons: white white white, awful writing, poor pacingGorgeous Watercolor SceneryChild of Light by Ubisoft is the prettiest game I’ve ever played. Every frame of every environment looks like it could be hung in a gallery. Seriously, just look at this:The environments and backgrounds were simply breathtaking. The artwork and the squid-like hair movement made the game for me.Girls Girls GirlsLet’s talk about how many women and girls there are throughout the entire game! SO MANY WOMEN AND GIRLS. It starts and ends with girls, which is how it should be. Aurora, the main character. The Lady of the Forest, who is the Queen of Light. Rubella, the first addition to the party. The Capilli leader. Norah, the sister. Magna, the giant. Cordelia, another sister. Gen, an orphan.  Umbra, the queen. The story’s premise and narrative also reveals a very matrilineal focus as the struggle for the throne involves primarily a feud between two queens, and their daughters are the ones who inherit that pain and burden. The narrator also reveals herself to be a mother and even a queen (perhaps Aurora herself), as the game wraps up with “Soon it will be your turn, princess, to leave on an adventure.”I do not believe that they make up a majority of the named characters in the game (based on my quick tallying of all the characters I ran into), but I’m honestly just excited that there are this many at all. It’s so refreshing to see a game spotlight young girls for this coming of age story.Not-Princess in a TowerChild of Light puts a flip on the typical princess in a tower trope. This time, it’s the dad wasting away in his tower as the princess journeys to save him. He ends up getting “fridged,” or killed off just to move the plot along and provide the main character motivation to exact revenge, a role typically reserved for hot girlfriends or beautiful damsels. It’s refreshing to see this role reversal, if the trope must exist in some form.Religious ImageryI get so excited talking about this. Child of Light is just drenched in religious imagery, heavily reminiscent of Christian arts and biblical stories, and it’s beautiful. From the moment Aurora wakes up on the altar, there’s something not just magical but spiritual about the world.  The game opens with a cinematic of long, narrow stained glass windows as the narrator introduces us to the plight of the Austrian dukedom. Already, it’s like we’re walking around a brilliant, illuminated cathedral in the moonlight.In the image above, the Queen of Light is depicted with her head surrounded by a large sunburst. It’s easily recognized as a parallel to the radiant halos in religious imagery used to indicate holiness. The Queen of Light proves to have power over life itself and various other miracles (granting Aurora flight, for instance). Her title and this halo serve as an early indication that she is more than mortal and holds not only kindness in her heart but also divinity.All of the story’s major cut scenes, which narrate the plot of the game, similarly feature stained glass cinematics, styled in a way that clearly reflects the stylistic features of the popular storytelling medium found in Christian churches. The story features resurrection, a flood, and a new beginning in a new world—all significant themes of major events in biblical narratives (the resurrection of Jesus and the Genesis flood).Yet, unlike actual Christianity, the world and story of Child of Light is entirely centered around women and girls. Aurora is the savior. She is resurrected—twice. The wise woman, the Lady of the Forest, is a mother. It’s revealed later that she is actually the Queen of Light, living on after her mortal death. Even though the Queen only shows up in the game a couple of times, her presence is felt throughout it all, through the flute song that Aurora and many others recognize as the Queen’s melody as well as the repeated mention of her memory as a beloved figure and leader among the people.On the other side, darkness is also represented by a woman and her daughters. Child of Light brilliantly tells its story in a way that feels so familiar and sacred while at the same time refusing to put any spotlight on men, who traditionally dominate Christian and other religious spaces.The Not-Magic FluteI absolutely loved the role of the flute in the game and story. It’s not magic. You can’t use it as an item in battle. Instead, Aurora uses it when there’s nothing else. It’s a coping skill. Nothing changes, but you feel better, and so do those around you. And that’s important, especially in circumstances of loss, grief, isolation, and chaos. A lot of video games champion a do-it-all strongman hero who just loves saving the world and wins rewards through direct actions against evil. But here, our characters have emotions, feel sad, feel lost, and need help. Yes, they slay dozens of evil creatures and save little villages, one at a time, but it’s hard, and sometimes they make mistakes, and sometimes they don’t know what to do. The flute and its song gives them peace, reminds them of home, and renews their hope. The music in this whole game is beautiful all around, but the flute song is particularly special and really touching because of the way Aurora uses it to ground herself and practice self care. Coping skills are so crucial to every journey, and I’m so happy it was included in this game in such a significant way.Okay, lets get into the dirt.So, this game is far from perfect. Here are my complaints. ♥♥♥♥ You, RobertRobert is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ honestly, and he never gets put in his place. His story arc is 1000% the overdone trope of “If I just try hard enough, gain enough money and hero status, I’ll get the girl.” Why anyone thought this story belonged in this game that is otherwise about awesome and genuine love for family and community… I have no idea. Margaret, Robert’s love interest, is super awesome and totally tells him off with a sweet “Boy, you don’t know me!” in her first appearance, but, unfortunately, she is forced as a trophy into Robert’s life during the ending round of story arc wrap-ups.Why do all the royal girls look the same?I get that they’re sisters, but they’re not blood sisters, and why would you pass up the opportunity to draw and create several unique and individual female characters. It just felt so cookie cutter to me, like “We just have 1 model of a girl and we’re gonna copy paste that for all the girls in this game—maybe change their hair color."" I’m used to seeing this happening in gritty action games, where there are no playable female characters and women are used either as decoration to ""set the scene” or as disposable but sexy bodies. So it is weird to see this practice repeated here in this game centered around female characters. And the rest of our party is so diverse in the way they look; I don’t know why they decided not to carry that over to the main character and villains.			"

												It's a good game in the JRPG style without the Japenese elements to it (anime, hyperbole, etc.).  Though the ending felt a bit rushed, the game was enjoyable throughout.  There are a lot of ways to approach battles, many different tactics depending on which characters to want to use, so there may be some replayability for those endeavoring to experiment.  Character progression relies on players making choices of which stats to boost and which abilities to learn, which I think is a great mechanic that many modern JRPGs have gotten away from.  You can level these characters to suit your style, and you're not just filling spheres on a skill tree without branches.The rhyming dialogue is interesting, bouncing between clever and annoying at times, but overall I think it's a success.  I'd recommend for anyone who enjoys RPGs with turn-based battles.  It's not a very difficult game, and there's plenty of side stuff to do if you go looking for it.			"

												Incredibly fun battle system.  You control a fairy like creature that you can use to heal your team or slow the speed of enemies.  As the battle goes on theres a bar at the bottom of the screen that has icons of your party and the enemies go past.  Near the end if you manage to hit an enemy during the last moments before their attack, the attack is cancelled and they get pushed back in the time line.  However!  The same can happen to you.  The combat becomes a super in depth game of planning and timing thats really REALLY fun.  The only complaint I have about it is that some attacks that enemis do have longer or shorter times when it hits the attack animation so you can plan ahead to be in front and interrupt their attack but they decided to use a much faster attack and knock you back.  Really wish they would have implemented a little pop up showing how fast the spell/attack animation is for combat.But yeah legit 9.5/10 RPG.  Also the game is adorable as ♥♥♥♥ yo			"

From the moment Aurora wakes up on the altar, there’s something not just magical but spiritual about the world.  The game opens with a cinematic of long, narrow stained glass windows as the narrator introduces us to the plight of the Austrian dukedom. Already, it’s like we’re walking around a brilliant, illuminated cathedral in the moonlight.In the image above, the Queen of Light is depicted with her head surrounded by a large sunburst. It’s easily recognized as a parallel to the radiant halos in religious imagery used to indicate holiness. The Queen of Light proves to have power over life itself and various other miracles (granting Aurora flight, for instance). Her title and this halo serve as an early indication that she is more than mortal and holds not only kindness in her heart but also divinity.All of the story’s major cut scenes, which narrate the plot of the game, similarly feature stained glass cinematics, styled in a way that clearly reflects the stylistic features of the popular storytelling medium found in Christian churches. The story features resurrection, a flood, and a new beginning in a new world—all significant themes of major events in biblical narratives (the resurrection of Jesus and the Genesis flood).Yet, unlike actual Christianity, the world and story of Child of Light is entirely centered around women and girls. Aurora is the savior. She is resurrected—twice. The wise woman, the Lady of the Forest, is a mother. It’s revealed later that she is actually the Queen of Light, living on after her mortal death. Even though the Queen only shows up in the game a couple of times, her presence is felt throughout it all, through the flute song that Aurora and many others recognize as the Queen’s melody as well as the repeated mention of her memory as a beloved figure and leader among the people.On the other side, darkness is also represented by a woman and her daughters. Child of Light brilliantly tells its story in a way that feels so familiar and sacred while at the same time refusing to put any spotlight on men, who traditionally dominate Christian and other religious spaces.The Not-Magic FluteI absolutely loved the role of the flute in the game and story. It’s not magic. You can’t use it as an item in battle. Instead, Aurora uses it when there’s nothing else. It’s a coping skill. Nothing changes, but you feel better, and so do those around you. And that’s important, especially in circumstances of loss, grief, isolation, and chaos. A lot of video games champion a do-it-all strongman hero who just loves saving the world and wins rewards through direct actions against evil. But here, our characters have emotions, feel sad, feel lost, and need help. Yes, they slay dozens of evil creatures and save little villages, one at a time, but it’s hard, and sometimes they make mistakes, and sometimes they don’t know what to do. The flute and its song gives them peace, reminds them of home, and renews their hope. The music in this whole game is beautiful all around, but the flute song is particularly special and really touching because of the way Aurora uses it to ground herself and practice self care. Coping skills are so crucial to every journey, and I’m so happy it was included in this game in such a significant way.Okay, lets get into the dirt.So, this game is far from perfect. Here are my complaints. ♥♥♥♥ You, RobertRobert is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ honestly, and he never gets put in his place. His story arc is 1000% the overdone trope of “If I just try hard enough, gain enough money and hero status, I’ll get the girl.” Why anyone thought this story belonged in this game that is otherwise about awesome and genuine love for family and community… I have no idea. Margaret, Robert’s love interest, is super awesome and totally tells him off with a sweet “Boy, you don’t know me!” in her first appearance, but, unfortunately, she is forced as a trophy into Robert’s life during the ending round of story arc wrap-ups.Why do all the royal girls look the same?I get that they’re sisters, but they’re not blood sisters, and why would you pass up the opportunity to draw and create several unique and individual female characters. It just felt so cookie cutter to me, like “We just have 1 model of a girl and we’re gonna copy paste that for all the girls in this game—maybe change their hair color."" I’m used to seeing this happening in gritty action games, where there are no playable female characters and women are used either as decoration to ""set the scene” or as disposable but sexy bodies. So it is weird to see this practice repeated here in this game centered around female characters. And the rest of our party is so diverse in the way they look; I don’t know why they decided not to carry that over to the main character and villains.			"

												Best artwork (all in watercolors!) and amazing story! Characters are vary well made, with diolog that rhymes everything! Only downsides is short story and Uplay. The Uplay isnt all that bad because you  can skip the 2 step varification, and the short story isn't all that bad because it stays fun even after beating it 4 times! I have over 30 hours in the Wii U version of this game!			"

												This was a nice ride through a cute lil world. It was more than I exptected. I didn't thought that there would be so many party members for your group. It's a shame that only 2 play at a time but it's easy to change between the fights. Nice characters, nice graphic-style. A big skill tree and every few rounds you can update your tree so you always get better and stay motivated. If you like an innocent rpg adventure with rhymes, you should buy this game.			"

												Despite some of the reviews claiming Uplay to be the cause of a lot of issues... I have, thus far, had no problems with it.While I have not yet beaten the game, I shall still recommend it simply based on the art style, atmosphere, and the amusing rhyming/poetic aspect of everything spoken in game.The are a few little puzzles here and there, but nothing much aside from box pushing and moving your mouse just right.The combat is unique as well.You can see enemies in the area as you are traveling. When going to fight one it brings up a turn based encounter event. Some encounters simply require the old style method of mindlessly mashing your basic attack button. Other's require a bit of strategy. A uniqute aspect to encounters is using your mouse (and your little buddy that you control with it) to slow the enemies actions, heal yourself, and collect 'wishes' during the encounters. This incorporates a bit of timing and determining which enemy to target first. If timed right and you have a touch of luck, you can make it through some encounters without taking any damage at all.I suppose I should mention a downside to the game.The main story is, thus far, rather enjoyable. But the little side quests you find from various NPC's are not so much. They do give you some nice rewards... but tend to be rather vague with how to go about doing them. Or just rather annoying by having you backtrack several areas to find something that has now spawned there only to grab it and travel all the way back.Very time consuming and sometimes the rewards don't quite match up to the effort put into them.Overall it is well worth getting. If you like RPG style games, exploring in a 2d environment, and the general oddities of what you might find... it is worth it.			"

												the whole game i was thinking its such an awesome game, looks nice, its like a mix of rayman, paper mario and trine. but then only with a female character.. graphics look like art and are real nice, gameplay also battlesystem and skill/crafting is addictive, in this game the crafting works with gems only, and there is this best gem to craft thats the princess stone, you have to mix up certain types of gems to get it...... but before i had enough gems to do so i allready made it to the end boss. i have to admit i skipped 2 quests and one of these quests gave me enough gems i would have been able to use to make the princess stone.. so it maybe was my own fault for skipping a side quest, but i did not expect a ubisoft game like this to end so fast.but thats the only minor thing i can mention about it.. you could have more playtime offcourse if you do all the quests and search for every loot i just finished this game in 16 hours, just one weekend. i have to say, for what i expected from the game i'm glad i didnt pay the full price, got it on 75% sale for 3,74 euro's and that made me buy it (by the way i almost never buy games when they are full price, mostly because i dont have an high end pc anyway). i would give it 10 euros but not 15 compared to other games availble on steam.but again i say i would not pay the full price for it because im more of a quantity then quality type of gamer, rather have more playtime than good graphics, anyway, if you are more into graphics then its worth your money! its a real jewel and it gives you more fun than going to the cinema so why not :) and its a game you have to play for sure tho			"

												I was excited for this one and even pre ordered it. I would say buy it on sale for the visuals alone because it is a beautiful game. I was ecxited to get involved with an old school type rpg gamem but this game is terribly dissapointing to be honest. I loike the wat the battle system works, using an extra character with your mouse to shed light on enemies to slow them down, or recover your hp slowly. But how did this get put out this way. I have 5 peaople in my party and can only use two at a time, granted when a characters turn somes up you can swap out characters right away with no time consequence but its just pain silly. I have three enimies to fight on one side and only two one my side? Comeon. The skill trees are absolutely boring with only upgrades to hp/mp as well as upgrades on magical/defense abilites that the characters just come with. They can only be upgraded very little with some getting a ""use/attack on option. No shops, no new weapons. You can upgrade your weaopn, defense, and time by setting gems in them for fire, water , lightning etc but again, boring as all get out. They could have done so much on this game that would have made it an almost household name but it just falls way short. Pros: Art and MusicCons:Everything elseI am not one to be critical or mean but this was so dissapointing, especially after promoting this on my facebook, twitter, tumblr on release day only to find that I have reccomended a bad game. I am around level 30 and have not finished the game but no new interesting things have happened outside of some more characters and to be honest some stunning artwork. Lets either update this, or make a better part 2 with purchasable weapons, actuall good spells, and a skill tree that was not made by someone who must have never played an rpg in there life. And for goodness sakes the mosy angering part, let us have more than two characters on screen especially if you are going to spend the time to allow more than two on the enemie side.			"

												Great artwork, great music, unfortunately that's all this game has going for it. While the game has great scenery, everything else is rather linear or lack luster.When first watching the trailer, I was excited to see how many abilities the game offered and a customization in making better gear/equipment. What I was not aware of is they counted even passive abilities and ""higher level versions"" of said ability to the count, when in reality the game only offered a handful of tools you can use during combat. The customization is extremely linear, filling your items with left over gems, only giving the option of making stronger gems for your character (which, there isn't many types create from).The gameplay itself is very simple even on the hardest difficulty. The game relies heavily on the time management system, making it easy to interrupt enemy attacks. So much so, that it may be possible to complete the game without taking damage (can't say for sure, but I was able to defeat the end game bosses all without getting hit thanks to such exploits in the design).What I expected was an old school style RPG game, sharing elements from such games like Chrono Trigger and Grandia. Instead, what I got was a developer that tried to mimic such elements but didn't fully understand how or why they worked.			"

												Giving a negative review due to UPlay. Two layers of DRM is unacceptable.Edit: Since many people have been unhappy with the above line being all of my review, let me add that I found the game itself very pretty, and the dialogue and the characters are quite charming in an old fairy tale kind of way. In the mood, I sensed a kind of mixture between cheerfulness, hope, and melancholy. The game works reasonably well, although sometimes the combats feel too long and too repetitive. The combat is turn-based and can take a while each time. You need to fight though to make your party stronger in order to be able to pass some mandatory enemies. I think the game would have been better with less combat.If you can stand UPlay and having to log in to many platforms to play a game, the game itself is nice. I do understand the developers of the game have probably been entirely helpless against Ubisofts politics with UPlay. Oh well.			"

												I wanted to like this game... but I can'tThe Good:-This game is beautiful in spite of a consistant bug where the protagonist's hair wouldn't render in combat, I cannot recommend the art enough, it is amazing.-Gameplay is fun and interesting.  I got to interact with systems that I haven't seen before and they were well executed.  The only problem is the game never really seems to get all that hard.The Bad:-Ubisoft's extra layer of DRM 'nuff said-The writing is aweful.  Like I don't care about any of the characters they're just healer, phyisical damage dealer, caster, buffer/debuffer ect.  There is no connection to what I am doing and I really don't care about the world.  Conclusion:I'm almost done the game and won't bother finishing it because it overstays it's welcome.  It's beautiful, but the developer's choice to write the whole game in rhyme was a complete disaster.  It's worth it on a sale for the time, but full price?  pass			"

												The game is undeniably beautiful, with the excellent score as accompaniment. The story is rhymed and whimsical to match, an ease and joy to read. The backgrounds are lovingly detailed, and the eagle-eyed would easily spot hidden treasures scattered across the land of Lemuria, and exploration is encouraged in side quests, opening up new sections of an area. The combat system may take some time to get used to, with certain elements of timing and luck required to get your skills or interrupts off, and learning it would make battles a breeze. While on the whole I would recommend this game, thus far there is a certain linearity; I had wandered ahead before returning to complete a quest, and later triggered a new story cutscene in a place I had already been to. The 2-member party size might seem very limiting as well, one assumes to encourage more active swapping. Edit on game completion: The replayability would come from collecting all the items, unlocking the skills, but if you're not one to do that, then leaving this game for a sale would be alright. One thing I should warn is that there is no brief break betwen the second last and the last boss, and I got a nasty shock from the transition. I myself would like to read all the dialogue all over again, but this is subjective.			"

												A game of light, there is no doubt.That if you seek beauty, you shall not pout.For music, graphics, and story tooThis game has those all through and through.A small complaint: The length and depth - Of fighting, bosses, and extra content.It could use more hard challenges, that's for sure...But to a child, who could want for more?Should I ever have kids, I'm sure I'll wantTo show them this creativity font.Because everything rhymes in game, I thought a review without it would be lame.But that is all I find wanting, more music and more challenges.The scope of the combat system could use some balances.For you see once you've killed a boss' two minions -It's curtains for them in my opinion.It seems such a waste on a new game plusNot to add more bosses and content to try and make you bust.Cirque du Soleil gave a composer to this.What he adds to the music is a nice shot of bliss.Having said all that, it's beautiful to children, women or men.I want more of it all.... Nine out of ten.			"

THEN on top of that you have this large open world, where you can find stuff, do missions, a true rpg. a true soviet game, did the soviets even have video games. call of lenin, that would be a good game. yeah this is one of the good games, the only thing that makes it a pain is that you have to log into uplay. uplay is actually the worst thing ever invented. everytime i open it up i contemplate if it would be easier to just crawl into my bathtub and kill myself, but its kinda worth it to play this game.

I like the puzzle elements, and I actually love the combat. I honestly don't really know why. The art style is very cool, and the world looks stunning, and I think that it was a very good choice to have this on the new Rayman game engine.From only playing under 2 hours of this game, I can allready say that it deserves an 8.5/10.

												Let me start of with this: I'm not a fan of 2D platform games. After 20minutes with Child of Light - I'm still not one. But this game, has never felt more user-friendly than any other I tried. It does not feel like 2D at all. Storyline as basic as it may be, had few very nostalgic moments which truly captured the mind. This is a mix of art, fantasy, fairytale and FF turn-based action, which will guarantee long hours of gameplay. Once the music starts, you will not want to turn the volume down. From melancholic violins and flutes, to the strong tubas and dramatic pianos accompanied by choir, Child of Light's OST is definitely a rich one, for such genre. Even after turning the game off, you can still hear the sound of Boss Battles.As for gameplay itself, it really kept me going. The graphics are such eye catchers, one does not want to end a level without fully exploring it. Physics done on Princess' hair is simply fantastic, just for the hair itself you let the character float around up and down, doing twirls and jumps. Despite same scenarios to all battles, the varieties of enemies were definitely satysfying and even on Normal Game Mode - I've had some troubles sometimes managing my health.Characters all all different with their own personalities, but not to spoil anything - I'll stop right there.Child of Light is a game for audiences of various ages, definitely worth anyone's while, time and money. It is with pleasure I can recomment the game to anyone, who thought the same as me (and not only) after watching the trailer: This looks cute, I might give it a shot.Do it. You will not regret a single moment :)			"

Its a nice old school RPG with all sorts of upgrades and team members and what not. The best part about this game though is the price. I bought it for $15. You can't beat that.

												Child of Light is a short, simplistic, visually striking turn based RPG/platformer.  The main draw of the game is its distinct art style which is a joy to behold.  The backgrounds have a very authentic hand drawn style that makes playing the game feel like walking through the pages of a childhood picture book come to life.  The locations you visit are varied and never long enough that they become tired or repetitive.  The animation and physics for Aurora are excellent and really help breath life into her character both in and out of combat.  If you want something that's enjoyable just to look at then Child of Light is a strong contender.With that said, the game doesn't really stand out on its gameplay merits.  The platforming aspects and puzzles aren't challenging and the main character's ability to fly makes navigation straightforward in most cases.  The ability to control Ignatius is a novel feature but never really evolves beyond using the mouse to click a button or shine a light on an object.  The battle sequences are standard turn based RPG fare for anyone who grew up in the 8 or 16 bit eras.  Again it adds a twist onto that with Ignacious who you can use to slow enemies and this does add a bit of skill to the game where you can put your foes in a position to be constantly interrupted if you manage it properly.  But even so the battle mechanics aren't particularly deep so there's not any need to micromanage enemy turns and I found I was more likely to throw away Ignatious' hope bar for free heals rather than pestering my enemies.The leveling, talent, and crafting systems are equally simple and don't do much to engage the player.  One annoyance is that your characters level up so often it becomes tedious having to acknowledge it after every 2nd or 3rd fight.  And the fact that battle experience is shared between your entire group means that even if you use just two characters throughout the whole game you'll constantly be dealing with skill points for all of your party members.  The talent trees are fairly boring and pretty much boil down to a lot of filler between marginally increasing your direct damage and group damage abilities.  Having long skill trees with things like, '+5 health', '+5 defense', '+1 dodge', for every character doesn't grab the imagination the way the visuals do.  The crafting system is equally simple with 3 primary, 3 secondary, and 3 special combinations of gems.  None of the combinations except the last one - which you won't be able to do until far into the game - feel very powerful which makes the tedium of combinations unrewarding.The sound and music are great but lack the variation that is apparent in the environments.  As good as the main theme and battle music are they're pretty much all you hear with a few flourishes in between marking certain events.  There are a lot of variations on the main theme throughout the game but by the time you're done it's hard to look back and not feel like it was all very samey.  I love the music, but I wish there was more of it.  And as good as the instrumentation for the game is the same cannot be said of the narrator who begins and ends our time with the game.  In the English version her delivery of the prologue and epilogue feel very unnatural.The writing for the game leaves something to be desired as well.  The game tries to render every interaction in a sing-songy faux-meter that you would expect in a fairy tale but often times this doesn't work out well.  The majority of the lines have wildly different meter but will end with a rhyme.  Other times they have a steady meter but don't rhyme.  Yet other times you can see that they've used some bizarre word order just to end a line with a rhyme.  It feels very inconsistent and I would assume is the result of localization.  Because the majority of the dialogue was shoehorned into this not-quite-poetry style it makes a lot of the back and forth between the characters a chore to read and parse.  I can appreciate that the developer had the vision to make a game using sylized prose but as beautiful as the graphics are I must say the writing is not.The game has excellent pacing and runs just about 8 hours long to complete on your first run through.  For me this is the perfect length as I finished the game just as the battle system was starting to feel repetitive which means the game held my interest for exactly the amount of time it needed to.  If you're a completionist then it also offers collection achievements, side quests, and the option to play through the game again on 'New Game+' using your saved character data.When I look at the game as a whole it's hard not to notice a lot of the shortcomings that prevent it from being a masterpiece.  Heck, from a pure gameplay perspective it's hard for me to say the game is even above average as much of its implementation skews towards being overly simplistic.  Notwithstanding the criticisms, the artistic charm of this game won me over.  The graphics and music of the platforming sections evoked memories of Trine while the battle system felt comfortably like stepping back into Final Fantasy VI - both of those are happy places to be.  For me Child of Light put a beautiful new face onto game structures I'm nostalgic for.I had a very pleasant time with this game.  Recommended.			"

												This game is magical, pure and simple. From the audio, design, to the music, you'll be entranced by the story of the lost little girl in the strange land. The characters are charming, the combat is fun and thoughtful without being tedious, and the collecting of items (mainly confessions) doesn't feel like a chore. The story though, is where this game really shines.If you like an RPG with charm, heart, and a dash of a traditional fairy tale, get Child of Light.			"

Ubisoft if you are ripping off steam at least put some efford. But the game is really nice. Combat requaires thinking, you wont win every fight just by nuking enemy. You also need think when to defend and use your whisp companion to slow down enemy or heal yourself. I would recoment this game for rpg fans if not for blasted uplay			"

												One of the most amazing games I've played in a long time. The story is endearing, the characters are adorable, there's a strong female protagonist (for once!) and I loved the music so much I'm eyeing the OST. Visually, the game is stunning. The backgrounds look hand-painted, but have a level of interactibility I didn't expect, and the game has a charming 2D kind of look to it that still manages to have so much depth. I could look at the backgrounds all day. The battles are turn based, but unike anything I've experienced before. At the bottom of the battle screen a ""timeline"" appears, segmented in two (waiting and casting) and your placement on the timeline, as well as your enemy's place determines who attacks first, but if you manage to attack them before they attack you and while they're in the casting section, you can actualy knock them back on the timeline, delaying their attack, It makes you have to think ahead, so that when you finally beat the bad guys, you feel like a tactical genius.The Skill trees are pretty simple, as there aren't a whole lot of flashy moves, but a lot of opportunity to strengthen the ones you do have, which I actually find more satisfying than having a bunch of different, yet low-power options. Throughout the game you can collect gemstones of various types called Oculi, which you can then combine to make bigger ones, or different ones, or bigger different ones, with each type of gemstone offering a certain perk or strength that, when equipped to one of 3 slots that your character and anyone in her party has, can give you that advantage in battle, or extra XP gain that can sometimes mean life or death.The dialogue is exclusively in rhyme (I want to say iambic pentameter but I haven't been keeping track) and although at times it seems like they're really scambling to make it rhyme, it doesn't diminish the story.   Some reviewers have said that this game takes 12 hours to get through, but I've been playing it for more than that, and not only am I nowhere near finished, I haven't been bored for even a minute, despite taking my sweet time.

												This game is amazing and it's only $15.  No reason to not get this game.  Beautiful 2D hand-drawn children's story book art with Grandia style time-line battle system.  What's there not to like?  The day one DLCs can totally be ignored as they're just boosts for your character in-game.  GET THIS GAME!!			"

												A intressting take from UBIsoft on a more Final fantasy remminisent style, infused with a art style simmilar to many Indi-games. (Rendered models with artwork backgrounds). The soundtrack is intressting, however lacks diversity when you feel it is needed (Boss music in particular).The games artwork brings across the soft style it needs to brings across well telling the story. However, my only flaw with this game is the obsessive need to Rhyme. It tries to hard to Rhyme, and sometimes is a-bit, nail biting to say the least. The Story, is beautiful, slow paced, but almost obvious from the start, However, this diddn't stop me from completing it in 8 hours flat, (breaks included). Infact, this pushed me to finish, as i wanted to see how it would play out, and it was worth it with the support of beautiful, Final Fantasy styled concept art, (Suggest looking up Yoshitaka Amano) which adds to the soft and warmth provided in the game. It's a intressting take, on a style which has since been laking somewhat recently, and i recommend it if you have played transistor, if you would like a see on something more softer and just as heartfelt.

												Child of Light is absolutely the most beautiful game I've played in a LONG time. Gorgeous graphics, incredible music, fun exploration and an awesome combat system. This is what JRPG combat is all about. Just wait until you get an hour or two into it. I'm blown away by this game. I hope this game becomes at least a trilogy.It's very relaxing and whimsical. Truly original. A breath of fresh air amidst the usual run-and-gun games that are out there (which I like, too.) This game is FANTASTIC.Any fan of JRPG's or strategic combat need to get this game. What rare treat! :) 4.9/5			"

												I am really into turn based RPGs that probably greatly helped in my appreciation of this game. This game is great. Although no one part stands apart as truly amazing. It is overall a great experience. Combat is a bit lacking in early parts of the game, but the enjoyment it provides picks up speed an hour or two in. The dialog is not deep or life changing, but amusing at times and the story as a whole is enjoyable. I do recommend playing on hard if you want to have to actually pay attention to what your characters are doing. Exploration is also rewarded. Although there is not much variance in the items to find, trying to collect them all is a worthy goal. Uplay will turn some off, but it is handled well, was complication free for me and even worked offline. None of the DLC is remotely required and only one bit of it is actually worth wile. If the game interests you, I doubt you will be disappointed with your purchase. That said you are not missing out if you wait for a sale. I urge you to keep it on your wishlist and play at some point.			"

												It's truly a beautiful piece.A few words on the aesthetics:The artstyle has a nice oil painting feel to it which is pleasing to the eyes.The soundtrack is really melancholic invoking true empathy for the characters as well as helping the immersion significantly.The dialogue is very poetic and is not afraid to plunge into the olden English which gives the whole story a classical fairytail story feeling to it.A few thoughts on gameplay:While the combat system is the game's main mechanic, I don't believe that it is the true focus of the game.I believe that the game's main focus is exploration and discovery, to explore this new and unfamiliar world, to find hidden nooks and crannies filled with treasure chests and lore.However the game can be played in both ways:If you prefer the RPG elements and combat over exploration lore and discovery, I'd recommend setting the difficulty to HARD so combat plays a more deeper role in the game and you'll need to focus more on gaining levels as you progress.If you prefer to explore this 2D open world, looking for treasure chests, exploring seemingly abandoned houses and whatnot, I'd recommend setting the difficulty to NORMAL for maximum pleasure, this way dealing with the occasional monsters along the way as you continue to explore should be sufficient for you to advance through the game in an enjoyable pace.

												I have actually fallen in love with this little gem of a game, its beautiful. Feels like im playing a painting. The poetic style of writing with the harsh yet compelling story makes you feel you're way through, not many games have been known to do this and for £12 it doesn't get any better.A simple beautiful compelling game that you can easily connect with. Would reccomend 10 out of 10 on every front.You would be passing up the experiance of a life time by not buying this!			"
