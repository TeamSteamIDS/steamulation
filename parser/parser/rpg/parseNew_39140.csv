												I first played the original PC version of FF7, and then later the PlayStation version.After purchasing and replaying the Steam version, I can wholly recommend it as the definitive version of Final Fantasy VII to play. I'll start off with some quick points about this version in comparison to previous versions. The actual game will be discussed in more detail below.Vs Playstation:+Smoother look on the characters+No disc swapping+English translation has been tidied up and the plot is more coherent (No one seems to talk about this, but it's major in my eyes)-Swearwords have been replaced with !@#$ style characters.Vs original PC release:+Hassle-free, in my experience (40+ hours) <-- This is the key thing for me.+PSX music added, as opposed to the awful original PC music. Huge plus! The song ""One Winged Angel"" now has vocals like it should do :)+Rendered characters are now synced perfectly when walking over a pre-rendered video.+Videos look smoother and match the PSX version, which is very nice in comparison to original release.-Default keyboard controls need two hands. Original PC release had default keys all on the Numpad. Meaning you can scratch your chin or drink coffee while playing. Easily resolved anyway :)-Yet another thing you have to create an account for. This time for Square Enix. Once you've done so, you can pretty much forget about it.I have an Xbox controller, but never tried it admittedly, so can't comment on that! I found the game plays perfectly with keyboard.It's surprising how well Final Fantasy VII has aged. I hadn't played the game for nearly 7 years now, and was expecting it to be incredibly ugly. Don't get me wrong, it IS incredibly ugly, albeit in a charming way now. Rather than a good looking game being badly ported, this is a bad looking game that's been ported just right. You can't change your resolution (to my knowledge), but there's absolutely no need to. The game makes use of pre-rendered backgrounds and the resolution they chose for the 3D characters was a good compromise between smoothness and not sticking out too much from the backgrounds. It does look much better than the PSX version, and a bit better than the original PC release.I am also happy that they stuck with the original PC version's English translation. If you've only ever played FF7 on one platform before, you may not know that the PC version had a much neater, tidier translation. I'm not talking about a complete overhaul like some of the other Final Fantasy remakes. This is still the original story told in what the original PSX translation was trying to do. Any line that was fine before, is unchanged. They simply removed some (admittedly funny) spelling mistakes, and only changed lines that really did not make any sense at all. It makes the game feel more natural and therefore I highly recommend a replay if you've only played on the PSX before. The one noticeable, and unfortunate, change is that the swearing has been replaced with !@#£ style symbols. You can still tell they're swearing and what word they were going to say, but this unnecessary censorship felt a bit out of place. Still, it doesn't make or break the game. And just to be clear, this isn't new to the Steam version as it was present on the original PC release.Also, as I might as well say it now: The story IS really good. As FF7 is one of the most popular entries in the franchise, it sometimes gets a lot of flak from people who seem to only want to dislike popular things. These are personal games, which you should play for yourself, and FF7 offers a deceptively complex story, with a fantastic combination of twists. 'Twist' is a harsh word, because it implies a sudden and unexpected change in the story's direction. This is not the case. The 'twists' are completely natural and only serve to make everything before fit into place better. The combination I mentioned earlier is in reference to twists which you will definitely understand on your first time through, and some which may only make sense with a bit of thinking or a replay. The latter are not essential to understand, but you'll feel a satisfying sense of revelation if you do. All in all, this is a well-thought out constructed tale. It may not be as fast-paced as you'd like, but the end result is very satisfactory.The gameplay itself is surprisingly fast for a 90s JRPG. You can get through battles pretty quickly, and most of the attack animations are short enough to not be too annoying. With the exception of summons; huge magical attacks shown in a lengthy animation of a monster being summoned and inflicting damage on your enemies.The Materia system is still great and offers lots of customisation for your characters, although it's not as complex nowadays as it used to be. To be clear, Materia are 'gems' which you attach to characters to give them extra abilities or magic. As a Materia is used, it gains its own experience and gets progressively more powerful. The only complexity comes from managing who has what materia, and this is the one area of the game where the age really shows. You can only quick swap between character's Materia screens for the three characters in your party, rather than every available character. Therefore you are forced to constantly swap characters in and out to get the best setup. [EDIT: A number of comments have corrected me and pointed me to the Exchange option, which negates this complaint of mine!]Is it worth £10? Admittedly, this port probably generated no where near the amount of work needed to justify the price, but the quality of the game does. Therefore it's a tough question to answer. I suppose if you look at what you're getting, then yes, it is worth the price. Your first time through the game can literally take 60-70 hours. My replay was 40 hours long, and I know the game extremely well.This is now my favorite way to play Final Fantasy VII. And that is probably the one thing you needed to know.EDIT: Voted this game for ""Villain most in need of a hug"" award ;)			"

												Final Fantasy VII is a classic, there's no debating that. With it's first release on the Playstation back in 1997, this release is a repackaged version of the PC port released in 1998.  With cloud saves and achievements, it doesn't really stand out to people who may have already bought the game or have it elsewhere.Final Fantasy VII uses almost all the assets from the original PC version of the game. Music was re-encoded to OGG Vorbis, but was still based off of fairly ugly MIDI tracks that the PC used. Thankfully they are easy to replace as some poeple have even decided to use remixes of said tracks instead.Visually the game is very dated. 2D backgrounds, 3D sprites from that era with resolution stretching 2D elements while providing a modicum amount of improvement to the 3D models. While in the field, higher resolutions don't really help, but in battle scenes and in full 3D environments (Chocobo Racing, Submarine Minigame), there is a noticeable improvement.Controls are a bit awkward as for a 360 controller, the triggers, d-pad, and right stick aren't usable. However, you can get around that either by binding everything to usable controls or using a utility like JoytoKey.This is a bare-bones re-release, with the hard work for making it work with a modern OS stripped away for most people.Update: SquareEnix has managed to replace the MIDI quality music with PSX quality tracks. This means the game's music sounds extremely detailed compared to the original PC release.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Final Fantasy 7 Original Release: 1998 (2013 Steam Version) Genre Tags: JRPG; Turn-Based RPG; Action; Classic; Industry Jewel My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-65 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Nostalgia chasers; Strong narrative advocates; Gaming industry aficionado REVIEWIf you scroll down the (serious) positive reviews for this game, you no doubt see many people expressing their nostalgic love for this legendary piece of their childhood. I stand among these people. For many of us who were kids in the 90s, Final Fantasy 7 was and always will be the first truly epic game we ever played. So I’ll admit that I am definitely biased to love it, as it was my personal favorite game during a number of years of my childhood. But that isn’t why I’m going to recommend that you consider trying it. You should consider it because Final Fantasy 7 is a classic piece of video-game history that revolutionized the genre and because it’s a kickass game. At the time it first released, there were a handful of other large RPGs with huge worlds and a lot of gameplay (relative to the era), but they were uncommon and unpopular in the Western world. Final Fantasy 7 reached a pinnacle of awesomeness for RPGs that was unprecedented and subsequently elevated the genre into the mainstream gaming market outside of Japan. Not only did it have sound RPG fundamentals, but the sheer amount of variety of gameplay it offered was quite revolutionary for the genre. Chocobo racing and breeding, the motorbike scene, the snowboard scene, the Golden Saucer, the Don Corneo segment, and more all contributed to shattering the status quo for the genre. A lot of young gamers went from not knowing about RPGs to one of them being their favorite game ever. Not only that, but it became one of the cornerstones which provided a foundation for the genre to grow towards what it has become today. If there was a Video Game Hall of Fame, Final Fantasy 7 would no doubt be in it. Obviously, with more recent RPG blockbusters from franchises like The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, and Fallout, it is hard to continue to consider Final Fantasy 7 to be an “epic” game by today’s standards. Somehow it still feels that way to me. Or at the very least: since I enjoy the genre, I still find it quite fun to play.So I will admit that it definitely has been a long time since Final Fantasy 7 was one of the best games in existence. That said, even after the erosion of the sands of time, the game still feels exciting, intriguing, and massive to me. Even on my 8th playthrough I pick up on new subtleties in the story or discover new secrets and items. The story is interesting, if not a bit convoluted. (Some of the story was cut away to make it “less confusing for the Western market” or some such silliness. This wound up making it more confusing.) The Materia system is fun and, combined with the traditional XP leveling, continuously offers the satisfaction of progress as you play through the campaign. The world is intriguing and still semi-large(ish) even by modern standards. The characters are perfect clichés of the very clichés that they themselves introduced. And one of the best parts of the game will always be the intimidating boss battles with the signature music. It is doubtful there will ever be another kid who says Final Fantasy 7 is his favorite game ever, but most modern fans of the genre will enjoy this game despite its age.So there are a few reasons you may want to consider trying this game if you never have.If you consider yourself a true aficionado of the gaming industry, you will probably want to play Final Fantasy 7 at least once in your life. Even though there is a “remake” on the way (or out by the time you read this), I would argue you should play this version at least once to really experience a legendary piece of video game history in this semi-unadulterated state.Or: if you don’t care about any of the historical mumbo-jumbo, and just are looking for a fun, turn-based JRPG, then you can comfortably look to Final Fantasy 7 for that as well.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

YouTube™ Video: Analog Recommends: Final Fantasy VII

			Trent looks back at the JRPG classic that came to define a generation of gaming... Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

Based on it's simple ultra low poly chibi characters and it's low resolution, pre-rendered backdrops, younger gamers would have a hard time believing that Final Fantasy VII was a cutting edge title in 1997. In addition to being a technical marvel in it's day, along side Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time, it was an important ambassador for the potential of 3d graphics in gaming. Squaresoft had been working for some time to make their characters more emotive in order to sell their grand fantasy stories. With it's pre rendered cut scenes and fresh diesel punk and cyber punk informed sci-fi setting it allowed JRPGs to explode in popularity in the west. Boasting one of the most thrilling openings in RPG history, players take control of Cloud Strife as he joins the terrorist group AVALANCH in order to destroy a Mako reactor. Cloud's former employer, an evil corporation named Shinra, is using these reactors to harvest a new form of energy that is destroying the planet and each of AVALANCH's members has a personal reason to fight against Shinra except for Cloud. Annoyingly enough, Cloud starts off as an angsty, aloof♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but slowly opens up, dealing with his own bag of issues over the course of the game. The rest of the cast is colorful and generally likeable. During the fight against Shinra a new threat emerges, shaking the plot up and introducing players to one of the most iconic villains in history. It's a narrative that is compelling though it seems a bit more silly now than it did upon release. Square has desperately tried to recapture the magic of Final Fantasy VII and often it feels like they have only managed to parody their own classic game. Final Fantasy VII established several character archetypes that are regularly found in many modern Final Fantasy titles and they have never been as likable as they were in VII.  What hasn't been cheapened by the failures of subsequent Final Fantasy titles is the combat mechanics. While the turn based structure may feel slow by modern standards, the materia system remains a phenomenally flexible system that effects everything from what weapons you want to use to your character's stats. Materia are magic crystals that are a byproduct of the mako reactors in the game world and allow characters to use magic. Each materia falls into one of several catagories: spell, command, support and summon materia. Each weapon and piece of armor has a number of slots to place materia in and some slots are linked allowing support skills to compliment offensive materia. For instance a poison materia linked to an added effect materia on a weapon allows characters to poison enemies or deal elemental damage. Final attack materia combined with life materia will instantly revive characters when they fall in combat giving yo a second chance during tough encounters. Characters don't really have classes, statistically some are better suited for certain roles than others but the right equipment allows any character to function in a desired role.  Personally, what has burned Final Fantasy VII into the deepest part of my memory for the past 17 years has been the soundtrack. From it's delicate melodies to it's whimsical themes, the soundtrack to this RPG classic is every bit as ambitious and epic as the rest of it's design. Since characters relay their dialog in text, the soundtrack serves as their voice. Hearing a character's theme several years after playing the game is like hearing the voice of an old friend. There is more humor, love, suspense and wonder in this game's sound scape than many entire franchises. Final Fantasy VII is a classic and it's certainy worth revisiting for even experiencing for the first time. Thanks to a recent re-release on steam as well as versions available on the PlayStation network that's pretty easy to do. Unfortunately the port for steam isn't exactly exemplary. The controller support requires a mod to function properly, there are a handful of bugs and it requires registering with Square Enix. On the upside, there is cloud save support and achievements. In any case, I'd buy a lackluster port of a bonna fide classic if it convinces Square Enix to take a break from releasing embarrassing new entries into their flagship franchise in order to give gamers new and old a properly remade version of what is, arguably, the most popular game in their company's history.

												Best game ever!Definitely buy it somewhere, like from a store! But...DO NOT BUY IT HERE, AVOID!! Here is why:It is a 15 year old SINGLE PLAYER GAME. SQUARE have decided to finally put their prized games on steam...so why is that? why now? Unfortunately theyve gone down a dark and corrupt road...even as low as stealing...yes, i used the word stealing, because that's what this is.You need to register your personal information, which is required to be able to login to their online client, so that you can play this single player game. DRM...oh but it goes a lot deeper than that. Afterall, why have DRM on a single player game?...The terms and conditions of this unnecessary online integration, is THEY ARE SELLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES AND INSTALLING SPYWARE. In this aspect the game shouldnt cost you anything as theyre already making the money off of your private information which they have no right to deny you access to the game after pre-taking your money.But oh it gets worse...it also repeatedly installs a tracking cookie into your all your browsers in order to spy on your activity. Yes...spyware. You can remove them if you want, but they'll just keep re-installing themselves. (wtf Square...wtf)It gets even worse!Q: ""But wait....if you buy it on Steam, does that mean i automatically agree to the terms?"" NO because you havent even seen or even knew about these terms and conditions, nor accepted them. They have taken your money ILLEGALLY first, and given you the agreement later.^This warrants a potential Class Action Lawsuit, which if it happens, i will be joining.Square-Enix would not have a leg to stand on if people got organised enough to create this lawsuit against them.Q: ""I bought it, but didnt agree to these rediculous terms...can i get my money back because i was mislead and missold this item?""Legally you are entitled to a refund because you were, mislead, and tricked into buying something that had dangerous conditions given to you AFTER the sale, which is illegal.But to answer your question,NO, YOU JUST GOT ILLEGALLY ROBBED, SCREW YOU GIMME MONEY. YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK? YOU CANT HAVE IT BACK, AND NOBODY IN THE WORLD, INCLUDING STEAM IS GOING TO HELP YOU GET IT BACK ( i love you steam, but not helping people get refunds in this case, is again, an illegal procedure because YOU and SQUARE have not given any warning, any notice that these conditions exist before the sale). You just got robbed, and no authority on the internet has the balls to challenge this because ""Big company"" gets complete fkin immunity from the law.Square has gone so down deep in greed and corruption, that they are taking your money, and NOT giving you your game until you accept their spyware and contractual agreement to sell your private information....and NOT giving you the money back if you do not agree to do so.IV BEEN ROBBED, and have been refused my money back...having NOT been given the product i paid for.Its criminal...anyone one of us would be arrested and either fined or given a small jail sentence, yet these guys are getting away with it like theyre above the law.---EVIDENCE SECTION---The agreement link: http://account.square-enix.com/agreement/eu/#Your Privacy link: http://eu.square-enix.com/en/documents/privacy(if you are in the US, you may have different links than these im a British European)STORING YOUR INFORMATION: (this parts the same for most companies, straight forward)Quote 1: (agreement link) ""The Registered User agrees to keep the Square Enix Account information updated, current and secure.

												Final Fantasy VII was one of the first RPGs I played, and the first game I bought for the Playstation. I had never seen anything like it at the time. Such a big, immersive experience. Three discs long! It was the first time I had seen a game span multiple discs. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started.Breakdown of the game itself:Graphics - The graphics in FF7 are very much a mixed bag. The 3D models used in battle are about as detailed as you could achieve for 1997, at least for console gaming. The models used outside of battle, however, are very blocky and much smaller. They sort of look like squashed down versions. It may take some getting used to if you're coming from a game like FF8, for example. FF7 uses pre-rendered backgrounds, which looked far superior to the 3D textures of the time and look great on standard def TVs, but look a little pixellated on higher res computer monitors. The FMVs still hold up pretty well, even if they're nothing mind blowing like they were for some of us back in the day. Personally, I think the spell/attack animations hold up the best out of everything, graphics-wise. I love seeing the animation for spells such as Aqualung. :)Music - FF7 has some of the best music ever put into a video game, if you ask me. Nobuo Uematsu is a fantastic composer, and this game simply wouldn't be anywhere near as charming and compelling without his score, which does an incredible job of setting the mood for much of the game. Many of the tracks will tug at your heartstrings during the game's more emotional scenes, and many other tracks... Well, they just sound plain cool. The boss battle theme really got me pumped the first time I heard it, and I used to look forward to upcoming boss fights just so I could hear that music again.Battle mechanics - FF7 uses an active time turn based battle system. You can have three characters in your active party, and each can equip a weapon, armor and accessory. Each weapon and armor has slots in it, which you can place little orbs in called materia. Materia are where you get your special abilities. Without them, you only have the standard attack and item commands during battle. Materia come in five varieties: Green, which contain magic spells. Blue, which alter the effects of a materia it is placed next to, if those two slots are linked. Red, which contain summons. Yellow, which enable extra battle commands (Steal, for example). And purple, which are basically stat boosting materia. These categories of materia are referred to as magic (green), support (blue), summon (red), command (yellow) and independent (purple). There is a TON of materia in the game and each weapon and armor can hold up to 8 materia orbs, so character customization possibilities are practically limitless. The materia system is honestly one of my favourites of any Final Fantasy or RPG.Plot - You are Cloud, a former soldier of the Shinra corporation, which is basically the biggest world power in Final Fantasy VII. After parting ways with them, Cloud embarks on a new life as a mercenary, ironically being hired by a militant anti-Shinra group known as Avalanche. As you progress through the game you'll learn more about Cloud and his comrades' pasts and the various secrets the Shinra corporation holds, as well as the mako energy that's become so profitable for them. Along the way you'll meet lots of interesting characters, and there are even two optional ones you can recruit. I think that's a pretty good outline without venturing into spoilery territory. The characters in this game really have a lot of depth, for the most part, which is one of my favourite aspects of the game.Controls - FF7 was originally released for the Playstation, but didn't make use of the analog sticks. It used the D-pad to move your character around, so you should be able to configure it to work with just about any USB gamepad you happen to have. You can also use your keyboard if you don't have a gamepad or simply prefer not to use one.Issues specific to the Steam release:First off, if you get an error when launching the game, try going into your program files (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY VII\ for example) and right-click on FF7_Launcher.exe. Select ""Properties"" and go into the Compatibility tab. Here, tick the box that says ""Run this program as an administrator."" This fixed the issue for me on my Windows 7 machine.The only other issues I've had running the game have been it crashing a few times. Once when I first played through it on my laptop in 2013, just outside of the Mythril Mines (after travelling through them), and a couple times when casting Beta on my current playthrough. Not ideal, but nothing to really worry about. Just make sure you save often and always after a major accomplishment.So, a few things about the Steam port. For one thing, you now have achievement trophies. These are little badges that show up on your Steam profile to let all your friends know how awesome you are, lol. Well, something like that. You'll gain a badge for getting to certain points in the story, and there are badges for getting the most powerful limit breaks, maxing out your characters' levels, collecting materia, beating optional bosses, etc.One big change I'd like to talk about is the sound. The music in the Steam release is nowhere near the quality of the original Playstation version's. Luckily, this can easily be remedied by searching through Steam's mod section, where you can find mods to replace it with the original music, or even higher quality mixes (I recommend the one based around FinalFanTim's remastered soundtrack). :)There are a few other little changes here and there. Some of the dialog has been cleaned up a little, a few of the curses have been replaced with the iconic @%#$% characters, and... The models have mouths. Basically little black circles pasted onto their faces. It looks pretty silly to me, but it's not a major distraction (you can also mod the graphics if you're so inclined).I think that about covers it... Final Fantasy VII is widely regarded as one of the best JRPGs of all time, and it's definitely high on my personal list. Give it a try. For $11.99, it's well worth it.			"

												Bought this for the Nostalga trip I was looking forward to. and I would love to recommend the game, except for a few quite significant things:* Online activation of the Single-Player, Offline game before it will work. This relies on SE's servers working, which they didn't at the time of this review.* You MUST have or create a Square account before it will launch. This is *Mandatory*, so yet another set of credentials that will need to be created and remembered. Haven't gone through that process yet because of outages. - No clear warning on the STEAM page for this game.* From a brand new install, the ff7_en.exe file gets picked up by AV applications like Comodo apparently as malware, even though it's clean. This is apparently a known issue, and has been since July 2013 at least - There is NO warning about this on the STEAM purchase page.How the hell can you butcher something so badly? I haven't even managed to launch the thing successfully yet due to these issues, which is why I have a stunning 0.2 hrs on record for the game, attempting to launch, get to the auth part, then then AV eating the .exe .. I shouldn't have to make an exception in AV settings for a game.This is a SINGLE PLAYER GAME, and I was mistaken in thinking the Cloud saves and such were STEAM based - They are NOT. Maybe I'll come back to it and try again another time. Right now, it's uninstall and added to the ""I regret this purchase"" pile. My mistake for not researching deep enough before buying.Thanks for butchering the memories Square.Edit - They have finally put in that it requires a Square Enix Account in italics at the very bottom of the system requirements.

												From a new player who never had a Playstation growing up:What more really needs to be said? It's that game that has the legacy that no other RPG has ever attained. I went back to this because I never had a Playstation when I was a kid, and practically any time I've had a discussion about games of the past this one always came up, so when it came to Steam I had to give it a try. At first, it just sat in my library for nearly a year before I picked it up, because there was plenty of other stuff for me to play. But one day when I had the time and was like ""eh, why not?"" I finally did.After several days of playing from day until night, I understood why this game is important. I understand why FFVII is etched into history as the most famous RPG of all time. And I only just played and beat it for the first time like 2 years ago.If you're curious, I promise it's worth it. And the people who say it doesn't hold up may have a point, because RPGs have evolved vastly over the years, which might make this feel less special if you've played others before you give this one a try. But it does not take away from the fact that it is still an excellent game. Hell, here I am writing up a Steam review (regardless of how unneccessary it is) because I revisited the game again today, and seeing the empty review textbox felt like an invitation for me to pour my heart out for a game that, while new to me, I feel the same kind of love for as games I have been playing for the past 2 decades.I mean, you decide. I just spent like 20 minutes gushing about it to complete strangers that aren't even going to respond to me because FFVII clearly doesn't even need my positive review, because it's just going to get buried under all of the other positive reviews.

												Back in 2005,I was handed a pirated game by my friend.""You HAVE to play this!"". Curious,I installed and played the game on my then-fossil PC and found myself lost into the game for weeks!For I discovered a new genre.RPG,as the cool kids used to say.Cut forward to 9 years.RPG Scenario has completely changed with Bethesda and Bioware as the demigods of WRPG.Souls' franchise has been hailed as the masochist's paradise.CD Projekt Red is promising to deliver possibly the most epic game in terms of both scope and and scale.Square's Final Fantasy is struggling to keep up with its contemporaries due to the recent games which have been a complete blunder and is on the very verge of downfall should the next game fail.So how does a primitive game like Final Fantasy VII hold up today?{TL;DR Version Down Below}PRESENTATION:Oh, Final Fantasy VII was a complete looker for a game to be released in 1997 and the first game in series to have 3D graphics.Polygon textures, Pre-rendered cutscenes, Modelled character designs were the terms people heard for the first time.Storyline is above average but its narrative and storytelling is ace! This game proved that Square Soft knew how to do story right.They do have a few plotholes, but they aren't enough to bring the whole experience down.  Sure the game itself looks supremely fossil for today's standards.But when a game has memorable characters with zero voice acting...yes,picture this.. Characters with no voice actors that were memorable!So yes, Great characters, a plot that just oozes intrigue to be uncovered and soul-rending music, Final Fantasy VII represents all that which the recent games seem to be lacking.GAMEPLAY:Final Fantasy VII is am old school JRPG in every sense which boasts an open-world setting, turn-based combat and some annoying mini-games.But you'll be interested in the former two aspects. The character progression system requires you to be playing a lot of hours because once you hit Level20,you are going to need a LOT of XP points to progress.For that reason I found myself farming XP for hours,that can be frustrating for some. The game does get tough eventually so you'll need to keep your character's levels higher and equip them with better gear from time to time.Turn-based combat is also very well implemented with ""Materia System"" which is incredibly deep and allows for some interesting mix-and-match combinations.The influence of its combat can be seen in recent games like South Park:The Stick of Truth and Child of Light. It takes a while for the game to open up.By end of first 7 hours, you almost learn everything you should about the mechanics and systems.Animations are still clunky and stick-like, meaning its still the unchanged PS1 version you're playing.While it does have Keyboard support, you'll still want to play using a gamepad.The game can be completed within 40hours.Even more if you try to unlock all characters, learn all techniques and defeat the additional bosses. For most part, the game fulfills your needs for everything Role-playing.{FOR TL;DR SPAMMERS}PROS:+Satisfying storyline and narrative+Great characters+Robust combat+Reasonably challenging+Sublime music and OST+Features one of the best antagonists in video game culture CONS:-Graphics sure look outdated.VERDICT:An absolute piece of masterwork.Final Fantasy VII was an achievement in RPG genre when it released.The later games in the series sure had upgraded visuals and graphics but none of them come close to this one when it came to capturing the very soul of what makes RPG an RPG, like VII did.All said and considered,Final Fantasy VII is the best game in FF series and one of the best JRPG of all time.If you are a self-proclaimed fanatic of this genre,then pick this one up whenever you can. You owe it to yourself.			"

												I could go on and on about FF7. But I think it's the Nostalgia talking. I grew up with this. I was a hardcore Nintendo fanboy, loved my N64, until one day I walked into a Blockbuster (Oh yeah, I'm that old) and in the store they had a playable demo of FF7 (Yeah seriously that old). I was instantly absorbed. I'm sure younger people won't get why so many older people go on about FF7, it isn't a matter of it being timeless exactly, though I still love the story. I think it's a matter of if you grew up playing video games in the 90's, this was just something else. There really had never been something quite like FF7. It wasn't a kids game, it was an over the top action title, it was serious and dark (relative to the era again). It had/has amazing music, a deep story and narrative, one of the most classic villains in gaming, one of the first and most powerful death scenes in gaming and had a great battle system. Again though, this was all for its time (Except for the soundtrack, it's still wonderful). By todays standards I'm not sure it compares so well, especially since RPG's have really changed in a lot of core ways, from combat to dialogue, it just doesn't work the way RPGs today do. It requires time, a lot of it, investment and interest. If you're the kind of gamer who just clicks through unspoken dialogue you should probably pass, if you play games in a hurry and don't walk around searching areas and talking to random NPCs, you should probably pass yet again. You get into FF7 to get into a story the way book worms get into a book, this is an investment on your end. You should celebrate the characters triumpths and mourn their losses. I'm sure that sounds silly to many, but that was the era of gaming this was a part of. We weren't CoD junkies who lived for point and click gratification, we wanted stories, and not the stories that our parents had, these were OUR stories, these were the new stories of our childhoods, we just didn't know it yet.

												Final Fantasy is back. Again. For the 3rd time. But what's nice is this game is fully optimized to play on new hardware. I won't go into specifics on what Final Fantasy VII is all about, since unless you have been living under a rock, you already know. But for those rock dwellers, I will give some basics. Final Fantasy VII is an epic turn based RPG. One of the finest in its genre. It has a grand story. Memorable characters. An amazing soundtrack. Everything has aged wonderfully, except I'd say the visuals. Luckily with the power of the MOD, you can relive this classic with a fresh spin of the visuals (just search around) giving you a new experience on this gem. The only problem with modding FFVII is that you will need to roll back the exe which will in turn disable any achievements. So I'd suggest for achievement hunters that you play through the game unmodded. And replay it later with the beautiful mods added. With that said, aside from better new system support, this re-release of FFVII also adds a higher res for the included character designs, as well as cloud saving, and a mode which will increase HP and Gil, with a seemingly tedious process. The latter mode is completely optional, but works in a way which does not hamper any enemy level scaling. It only boosts HP/MP, and not any stats or levels. So you will get the same scaling flow you would when playing it normally. This however does mess with your limit meter. So use at your own risk. either way, FFVII is a great classic. Fans of it originally should check out this re-release. And newcomers need to experience this at least once in their lives.			"

												Honestly, I don't care much for writing these glowing pieces on highly-acclaimed games. It's the whole ""preaching to the choir"" aspect that bothers me. I ran into this before back when I reviewed Resident Evil 4. Everyone knows FF7 is a great game, so why even bother with the review? I should just save myself the time & effort, make a humorous reference, then sit my♥♥♥♥♥down and drink...oh right. So I have to say something significant. I have to put words on a page that somehow match the importance and majesty of this classic JRPG. So let's get started.Like any other game series, Final Fantasy has had its humble beginnings, its ups, downs, controversies, and even today we're uncertain of where it'll go next. Like any good lemming we follow along, buy the latest games, all the while hoping that eventually Square-enix will take the franchise back in the direction we want it to go in. The thing is, there's always been one path, and game-development isn't about what ""we"" want. FF13 might be a wildly different game compared to FF1, but if you played through most of them, you could see how such a divisive entry could be released. It's the accumulation of elements, taking what works, changing what doesn't, and evolving into something different. But we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.Final Fantasy 7 is probably not the best JRPG of all time. When it comes to opinions; I don't touch best/worst anything. FF7 is a great JRPG, and certainly a remarkable entry in the series. Part of its quality is in its spectacle. Yes, I'm actually talking about the flashy stuff. Even in its earliest entries, Final Fantasy was always about grandness. In FF3 for the Famicom there was the discovery that your world, was just a tiny floating island in a much larger world. FF7 works in a similar fashion, with that tiny island being Midgar. The battles in FF games have always pushed for more special effects. Everyone remembers their first time casting Ultima in FF6, just like the first time they summoned Knights of the Round. This touches on another aspect of FF. No effort (no matter how slight) goes unrewarded. One of the aspects I've always enjoyed about FF, is that I can wander into a forest in the middle of nowhere, and possibly bump into a unique monster. Perhaps this monster has a cool special move, that looks really neat, and maybe I'll be able to make it my own (via blue magic or otherwise). Other entries (like FF9) mix things up, like having mini quiz-shows hiding in the forest. It relates to one of my favorite aspects of the original Baldur's Gate. By simply wandering the outskirts you're bound to encounter more than just monsters. There's a lot of neat little discoveries in the dozen or so optional areas BG1 had. FF7 is a much more linear game, yet it still understands the importance of deviation.The character models...I actually can't complain about them. Yes, nowadays we can simply mod everything so that it looks uniformly superb but...well I'm starting to see the appeal of those blocky wonders. This isn't nostalgia talking either, this is something I just noticed in my most recent play-through. Squaresoft put a lot of work into giving NPCs life. Even today, NPCs in RPGs are only good at standing around, walking in random directions, or (in the case of later Bethesda RPGs) doing a bunch of ""radiant dynamic AI"" actions that somehow look more robotic than if they were just scripted. A lot of NPCs in FF7 do things, memorable things, things that humans would actually do. Early in the game, there's this woman waiting at a train-station. Now this woman isn't anyone important. In fact, you're supposed to pay attention to the flashback this woman is a part of. Regardless, her boyfriend/husband arrives via train. He's back from war, and he's so happy he does his best Gene Kelly impression, by swinging around a streetlight.I can't state enough just how brilliant these little moments are. There's no dialogue between these unimportant NPCs, they don't factor into the plot, and yet they add so much. The two most recent FF games I played through were FF13 and FF13-2. The few times I ran into NPCs they're just...standing around. Sometimes they walk, and they say a line or two when I walk past, but that's usually about it. Actually, FF13-2 did have the kids that run around the beach, one of them trips a lot. It might not sound like much, but that little bit of life makes the experience a lot more believable. Complexity. The first Final Fantasy was practically Wizardry with an overhead view. Even then, it had numerous ideas that offered replay value. The most obvious one is the class system. Once you decided on your party, that was it. Whether you went with the traditional (Fighter, Monk, White Mage, Black Mage) the different (Thief, Thief, Red Mage, Red Mage) or the ridiculous (Four White Mages), you were stuck with that party until you won the game. FF1 was an altogether difficult entry, with numerous random encounters that could wipe you out. One of my most memorable party-wipes was when my party of 4 was killed by a handful of ghouls. Every round they did 1-2 damage, and every round they paralyzed everyone. That was about 25 years ago...sheesh.By the time FF4 came out, the random encounter was no longer a serious threat. I never saw the easier battles as a ""dumbing down"" of FF. These RPGs have numerous mechanics and design decisions to keep track of. What better way to drill this into the player's head than through actual combat? The battles are there so you can figure out how everything works. Look at this way: You're always getting a new party member, new spells, espers, materia, junctions, jobs, gambits, etc upon etc. So naturally, you'll want to try things out, and not get killed in the process. It's like a tutorial...without actually being a tutorial (though FF has plenty of those as well).Most of the depth and challenge in FF comes from taking away all of the stuff you receive. This difficulty has to be player-imposed, but it works wonders for extending the value of these games. FF7 is no different, as there are low-level runs, no materia runs, and so on. Even something as simple as choosing not to use limit-breaks can massively change the game. After all, once a party member takes enough damage, their fight command is replaced with limit. Now what? Hopefully that character learned mug, or has some items that do damage. Heck, you might have to kill them yourself so their meter will drain. Suddenly those bosses you meteorained through become a lot more interesting.The best part is, even if you play through FF7 and take everything that's given, it's still an enjoyable JRPG. This is due to pacing. Unless you're trying to max out everything, FF7 is a +/-30 hour game. That is PERFECT! I can not emphasize it enough. Those hours are going to be spent in various locales, doing a wide variety of things, and having a grand adventure. I can't tell you the number of RPGs that I've given up on, simply because nothing happens for 5-10 hours at a time. A game having 100s of hours of ""content"" just isn't a selling point for me anymore. FF7 moves quickly enough, and still tells you all you need to know in terms of story/characters. It isn't spectacularly written, but it's an effective story that is appropriately-paced. All of this is why I think Final Fantasy 7 deserves respect. It encompasses everything that makes JRPGs work. No really, I believe this game is an example of flawless execution. I mean, a game like Xenogears might have a better plot & more interesting characters (to me), but between disc 2, the platforming, and  t h e  s l o w - m o v i n g  t e x t  t h a t  c a u s e s  m y  b r a i n  t o  g o  n u m b, I regard it as a ""more than the sum of its parts"" kind of JRPG. Still, it's like I said waaaaay back, FF7 is probably not the best JRPG of all time. It does a pretty good job of making you think it is though.  "

												I came into this game without any nostalgia at all connected to it, and came out thinking it was a masterpiece. A lot of people will say it hasn't aged well, and I agree to a certain extent, but it's pretty easy to get past the parts that feels clunky and outdated. If anything, it just makes the game feel more charming. The world is cool and interesting, the gameplay is fun (allthough sometimes it can feel just a little bit tedious) and the story is absolutely fantastic. The writing focuses a lot on the characters, which I think is a great thing, personally. All the playable characters got a lot of attention and character building, which made me really care about them in the end, adding to the emotional roller coaster that is this game.There are some pretty deep themes in FINAL FANTASY VII, such as loss and identity, and life and death. This only adds to the world and story, and makes it a much more unique and interesting experience.It's a pretty dark and complex story, at least for the time it was concieved. It does however come off as a bit much at times, like a ridiculous scene in the early stages of the game, where the main character, Cloud, rides out of a large office building on a motorcycle, all while fending off enemy pursuers with a sword.Despite this and a few other scenes, the story is very interesting and keeps you invested until the very end.As someone who had never played this before a few weeks ago, I can see how this game became such an instant classic. I honestly consider this to be the best game i've ever played, and I want to recommend it to anyone, as long as you have the patience for the outdated gameplay and graphics.			"

												Game Title : Final Fantasy 7Developer: Squaresoft / Square EnixGenre: RPG / Turn Based / Not turn based you can turn if off.I first started playing Final Fantasy 7 when I was 8 years old. I loved everything about it the world, people and music amazing. This game was my first RPG and really set the bar for others. If you ever read about why Square has not made a remake they state it is because and I quote here. ""CEO Yoichi Wada said that a remake of Final Fantasy VII will happen once the company makes a new Final Fantasy title that succeeds the seventh game in terms of quality and sales, something the company has to date failed to do"". Think about that for a mintue this game was made in 1997 almost 20 years later no other game they made has yet to top it...Story: This game is set on earth in another place and time. A place where the planets very blood ""The lifestream"" discovered by a company called Shinra, INC. Shinra found a way to turn lifestream into a power source and built reactors all around the world sucking up the lifesteam and killing the planet. You are Cloud Strife ""mercerany"" hired by your old childhood friend Tifa to help her and AVALANCHE put a stop to it... this story unfolds into an epic tale of love that puts the very life of the planet in your hands.Game play: The gameplay is smooth and seemless you always know what you need to do next. If you ever get stuck there are many guides that will help you figure it all out.  Battling enemies is fun you can make it turn based, or set it to active (no turns) for a greater challenge. There are many very fun and challanging mini game series in this game. A motorcycle challenge, submarine battles, snowboarding, and a few others. This game supports controllers I played the whole game with a Xbox 360 controller.Graphics: For the time period 1997 the graphics were soild the few in game movies have really nice graphics. Otherwise it's mostly blocky textures. There are graphics mods out that give the game a more updated feel. They are hard to install but, pay off if you get them to work.Audio: The music now updated is very nice! One of the only games where I used to play it just to listen to it.Overall: It has everything a rpg fan loves. A great story with wonderful music, the people all have backgrounds your can really get into. There are many side quests and challenges. You can't forget the Chocobos everyone loves those for dinner... I mean to race them.Story 10/10Gameplay 10/10Graphics 7/10 for 1997 10/10 if you can mod itSoundtrack 10/10Difficulty 6/10I give this game a 10/10 ( Square would make a killing if they remade this game with current graphics)			"

												Final Fantasy VII is one of my favorite games of all time.  I had the original PC version back in the day and it ran flawlessly if I remember correctly.  I played it with my Gravis gamepad.  Again, with no problems.  This version is a disappointment all around.  The first thing you will be required to do is to create an account with Sqaure.  Makes no sense at all, but hey.  Still, it is an annoyance.  Once I finally got the game fired up, I immediately started having problems with my gamepad.  The cursor was flying all over the place.  I had to download a profile for Pinnacle to fix that and the fact that a few of the buttons would not respond at all.  Again, an annoyance.  Despite this effort my character still wants to walk to the left much of the time.  This I cannot seem to fix.  Sure, I can just plow forward and try to ignore it, but it still detracts from the game.  Lots of people have complained about the music or the fact that the graphics look terrible on current HD monitors.  That really does not bother me at all.  The same great gameplay is there if you can get to it.  The horrible controls completely wreck it.  A person much wiser than me, who also owns this ""updated"" version, told me that it was a better idea to just use a psx emulator to run this game if you really want to enjoy it again.  He was right.  Square totally dropped the ball on this one.  They have pretty much dumped all over the game that literally put them on the map.  I am definitely NOT saying that Final Fantasy VII is not a great game.  It is.  This is just not the version you want to play if you want to enjoy it.			"

												Needs a seperate account to run, which detected me logging into my own account as unauthorized, locked down the account as if it was stolen. Also does NOT come in Japanese. Great game, and you may encounter great issues if you want to run it. Just get the Playstation version, which can be had for roughly the same price.			"

												10/10 If you don't play this game, you'll miss out on something really special.It's FF7. Genre defining JRPG from one of the great eras of gaming. Graphics were kinda dated on the PS1, the updated version hasn't exactly raised them to hyperreal levels. Sounds will stay with you for at least 15 years. The story is still one of the best loved and remembered of any jrpg.			"

												I purchased this game thinking it would be a lot of fun to revisit.  It would have been if the game would load, but it doesn't thanks to Square's spotty online DRM servers being down at the moment.  Reading about it, there are a number of others with the same issue dating back 4 years.  Square doesn't seem to concerned about it, so I've requested a refund.			"

												A classic from the Playstation 1 era. This is one of the first RPG games I ever played and has always set the standard of what I expect from an RPG. It features turn based, but active combat, a fun and more-or-less easy to follow story, and decent characters and personalities though some border on the cliche. Finaly Fantasy 7 has a good amount of side quests and minigames that can eat up plenty of time. From snowboarding to breeding and racing chocobos the handful of side quests and metagames can keep you entertained for quite a while.                I found that, as with almost all RPGs I play, one of my favorite things to do is collect all the strongest magics and weapons. There are monsters you can encounter that are even stronger than the last boss at the end of the main story. On top of that there are magic abilities that, if you have the patience to level them up, can make the final boss a walk in the park. Getting these weapons and magics require a great deal of grinding though, which is someting I find to be rather offputting. Squeezing every last ounce of gameplay from this title will probably take you somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 hours if youre the occational gamer like me.              Since it's initial release the game has not really aged well. If youre looking for a top-notch Final Fantsy expierience I would point you to one of the newer titles. It's kind of hard to look at the old graphics in high resolution. To help this they have an ""original graphics"" mode for people like me. It keeps the display to 480x640, but without the inherit funnyness of a SDtv set you still see plenty of jaggies and protruding polygons. The graphics didnt stop me from playing through one of my old favorites though.              Another gripe I have about the age is the clunky controls when roaming about but it's nothing you cant get used to. The button layout can be a tad confusing on the keyboard. If you happen to have a gamepad it eases this considerably, but you're probably going to have to spend a moment remapping the default controls-- no biggie.            One of my favorite aspects about the steam version is the cloud saving. True: its usless if you dont have an internet connection where you want to play. But I like the ability to play on my PC, go wherever, and pick the game right back up on my laptop. Aside from that there is also a ""character booster"" if you get stuck...or want to be a badass. I have not used the feature mainly because I forgot my square-enix login stuff moments after i made it.               Its not particularly weak in any areas but isnt as deep in character skill devlopment as I would like sometimes. Rather than molding your character(s) into what you want them to be, you have to play to each character's strengths-- again, no biggie.               Theres no voiceover, which is a huge plus for me. The story is good, characters are likeable, the gameplay is solid, and its good on length. It's probably 20 hours on the game clock on a casual playthough if you ignore endgame badass equipment, skills, and sidequests. All-in-all its worth it if it's on sale, but if you just want a stroll down memory lane you might be better off digging out the old PS1.			"

												I think after spending 200+ hours on this game, it's time to write a review.You guys ok with this? If not, so sorry (sarcasm)The PC version of FFVII! A great game gets a great PC port with a little graphic upscale on the side.Pros:This game is magic. Absolute gold. (And I don't even like FF games.)Fun to play (I literally spent 200+ hours on this. I think I might be a bit biased)Minigames. Chocobos are fun to ride around on.It will literally keep you busy for hours.Controls well. (Although, I did not use a controller and I'm not sure if controllers can be used. I prefer keyboards anyway.)Music is sweet.Cons:Master Tonberry (Stab stab)Ruby WeaponEmerald WeaponRandom EncountersAnalysis:Upon first glance of Final Fantasy VII, I almost blew it off. Steam Christmas sales changed my mind quickly.I picked it up and started it. The beginning was slow. Not slow enough to deter me from the glory that I would experience later on though. You start off as Cloud, an edgy, roided up, Ex-SOLDIER mercenary. You are hired by AVALANCHE to rig one of the mako reactors to explode. You do this. Easy stuff.Story continues (I'm not going to spoil anything. Just look at this review and determine if you want to buy it.)You will find enemies that you will absolutely hate. I'm quite sure my least favorites were the parasites and Master Tonberry. The story will tug a few heartstrings. I choked up a bit when a couple things happened. There'll be some twists and turns that you might not expect (Unless you were played the original. Then enjoy this masterpiece again, friend.)There'll be some goofs and gaffs. The characters are unique and their dialogue is entertaining. DON'T TOUCH THE RED THING IN THE DESERT. Still not going to spoil anything... but when you get to the ending, Be prepared to have some of your soul ripped out of you because it's so gosh darn good.Conclusion:The game is almost perfect. It's flaws will and have been pointed out, but I'm not here for that. I like the game for what it is and I highly recommend buying it. It's been worth the 200+ hours and I definitely got my money's worth.			"

												This is the most memorable game you can find, and the best. There are so many epic characters, fantastic gameplay, lovely world map, and AWESOME story!You have many interesting and epic hours if you want to do the story, and even more fun hours if you want to do all of the side quests. This game has also very high replay value, because when you are finished with the game, you will miss everyone and starts the game again after a short period.The soundtrack on this game is a Masterpiece, you will love it! There are many emotional parts on this game, that is hard to forget. I know the graphics are not perfect, but it's very nostalgic!This is the greatest game of all time in my personal opinion. Play this game NOW!It was, is and will always be the best Final Fantasy. Period.- Caomhainn in the comment section "

												1) You DO NOT NEED TO BE ONLINE 24/7 TO PLAY. You just need to have internet while you make a square account. Then once you're logged in, go to 'FF7 Launcher Settings' and disable 'Cloud Saving'. There you go. FF7 will never need to be connected to the internet again.   I point this out because I keep reading reviews that say you need to be online 24/7 DRM blah blah... and its completely untrue. It put me off of buying the game for awhile. Screw that. Now you know.   2) They updated the character models and enemies and they did a good job. Its a perfect mix of old and new, slanted towards old. The models are improved, not changed. And if for some reason you hate it, in the launcher theres a toggle. You can have the exact Ps1 graphics if you want. But once you switch you'll want to go back to the updated version, trust me on that.3) Check out all the different mods for the steam version of FF7. Depending on how far you want to go, you can mod this games graphics pretty hard.   TLDR: If you played FF7 as a kid and loved it then get this. 6 bucks is a steal.   TLDR#2: You don't need to be online 24/7 to play. That's a myth. So don't worry.			"

												This game isn't just a game... It's the best story I've ever played. I'm 27 now, and have been playing this game since the day it came out. What tells me this is a good game... I can describe to you where I was when I played it. The time of day, who had the controller, my brother or myself. If you haven't played this before, I welcome you to YOUTUBE some of the FF7 Remake Live Reactions. These videos hardly display the feeling a lot of people have for this game. Some of the most vidid memories of my life revolve around this game. I can't hear the word Cloud without picturing golden spiky hair.*----------------SPOILER ALERT---------------------*I remember the morning I sat and watched my brother play through the Forgotten City (Capital). The music plays in my head on a daily basis... I'll never forget the pit I had in my stomache all day after watching one of my favorite game characters die in Cloud's arms. The story never stops unraveling, and has generated such a vibtant world I enjoy as much every time, as the first time.Sure, games these days offer a lot of what FF7 had. But this is the game that really re-defined a whole Genre.This (to me) was the end of Final Fantasy's Golden age. FF4, FF5 (Ish to me), FF6 and FF7. Incredible story telling, fun characters, memorable moments. 8 Was the start of a slide that they almost came out of with 10, but in my oponion...this is the best Single Player Final Fantasy ever made.DYING for the new release. Already bought my PS4 for the occasion.CONCLUSION: Unless you're not into fun games, awesome stories, crude language, and a fun guessing game of what they will have to tone down for PS4, BUY THIS MUTHA' ♥♥♥♥IN GAME!

												What to say about FF7 that hasn't already been said? No, it's not the best game ever. Yes it has flaws, yes, the graphics are outdated, and a big part of his success comes from when it was released...That being said, and while I can't deny the fact that I have a huge bias, since it's the first video game I've ever played...The thing that strikes me when I play again is this game's generosity, in pretty much every aspect.- generous in term of longevity, the story is huge, long, with twists, takes you in many places. It's a game from an era where games where not necessarily designed with replayability in mind, and that frankly still doesn't need it.- generous in its gameplay, with a really nice system allowing you to think about your group roles, and that though about the fun part more than the efficient part. Also, an incredible number of mini-games introduced in the story to shake things a little, and later available as full blown mini-games (snowboard, submarine, Fort Condor,...)- generous in its music, with lots of soundtracks very well used to illustrate each place, or returning characters.So, yeah. There are a lot to be done, and the beauty of it is that it isn't forced upon you. It's a game where the devs did all they could to make the experience even more enjoyable, but didn't shove it in your throat.As I said, it's not perfect. But it will forever stay the perfect exemple of a video game done right, with the player's enjoyement always in mind.			"

												While Final Fantasy VII is a great (if very dated) game at its core, this has every symptom of a poor console port.  It's just a repack of the original port from over a decade ago.  Some things that show it's an effortless port:-Characters faces are bugged.  All eyes are open, even if they're sleeping. All mouths are gaping, which looks ridiculous after a time.-Controller mapping is awful (XBOX 360 controller).  The D-pad can't be mapped, which makes battle menus a pain.  You'll often accidentally slide to the side and choose Defend when trying to scroll down the menu.  R2/L2 can't be mapped.  The OK button decides to go ""turbo mode"" frequently and skip dialog.-No 16:9 mode (I don't count 4:3 awfully stretched to 16:9)-Lots of odd crashes.  If you tab out of fullscreen, it will crash.  If your controller idles off while tabbed out in windowed mode, the game will crash.  For a non-autosaving game with 90s-style spread out save points, this is infuriating.-If it can't sync your cloud saves, you can't save the game unless you exit and turn off cloud saving (losing your progress in the offing).If you played this in the 90s, and you want to give it a nostalgic run, go for it.  But know that you're going to have to accept a lot of lousy-port-isms.  If you didn't play this in the 90s, the dated graphics, old gameplay mechanics and PC quirks will make you regret the purchase. I wish I could give it a 6.5 instead of a ""Not recommended"" because it is still fun, and it's great to go back and play.			"

												When you launch the game you have to sign in with your Square Enix account because why wouldn't you put DRM on a 20 year old game that you made your money on 50 times over?The problem that I run into is that after signing in with my account it asks me to ""Enter a Nickname""  which I have tried a few dozen times.  Everytime, no matter the combination of Capital and numbers, it says ""Has already been taken""I contacted Square Enix directly when I couldn't set up a nickname on their website either.  They told me to try different browsers, use a different network, and even try a mobile device.  I did.  I tried everything they told me to try and I stil couldn't get in.  Here is another reason why online DRM for a single player game is nonsense.UPDATE 03/25/2017I have finished the long drawnout process of trying to get Square Enix to help me with my problem.  They told me that they could not help me and that it was the customer's responsibility to complete their own account information....which I can't...because their website is broken.It is past the 2 week mark to get a refund from Steam so I am just out the money.  This is the 3th time I have bought this game and it is the last time Square Enix will get another dime from me.  Congrats Square Enix you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off a loyal customer who has spent LITERALLY thousands of dollars with your company all so you could rob me of 7 dollars.			"

												Note: Look up the Xbox 360 controller fix if you're planning on using an Xbox 360 controller to play this game.I wanna start by saying that I have zero nostalgia for Final Fantasy. The only game I had played was Final Fantasy 1 and I never finished it.I was skeptical about the ""turn-based"" combat as I was pretty burned out on that kind of gameplay from playing too much Pokemon as a kid, however I decided to try it out after my brother recommended it to me and now I can easily say that this is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Right from the start I was hooked on this game; The music complements the gameplay and narrative masterfully, almost everything in this game feels truly epic. There were many times where I would stop for a moment and appreciate how good this game actually is, and slowly I started realising that I was truly playing one of the best games ever made. I won't talk about the story because I don't want to spoil anything (you should go into this game knowing as little as possible) but the story and world-building is phenomenal and had me hooked right from the get-go. I am aware that Final Fantasy VII does receive a massive amount of praise and that might make people think that it is due to nostalgia, but as someone who only just finished this game a couple of days ago for the first time ever, I can garantee that it really is a good as people say. I honestly cannot stop thinking about it even after having finished it, it is a beautiful game and I think everyone should experience it.			"

Its success is known worldwide which lead to the creation of other Final Fantasy 7 games and movies based on the original FFVII universe including the upcoming Final Fantas 7 remake. The story of FFVII is a masterpiece in every aspect, the battles, the characters, the mystery, the overall feelings combined together and the main protagonist Cloud Strife who is one of the most loved and famous characters in the history of gaming.

												New to the Final Fantasy series, I decided to pick this game up after hearing lots of good things about it. Final Fantasy VII is one of those iconic games which you hear so much talk about, that you have to play it in order to see if it matches what people say. And does it live up to expectations? Well, mostly.Story:FF7's story suprised me, as it was quite different to what I had expected, although not in a bad way. From what I'd heard beforehand, I was used to thinking of Final Fantasy 7 as this dark, brooding story set in a dystopian futuristic city, and while this holds true for the first couple of hours, there is so much more to it. As mentioned, FF7 is often seen as quite dark, but in reality it's a game which never takes itself to seriously, and still retains a sense of fun. The story itself is long and developped (it took me around 60 hours to beat the main story alone), and covers several mature themes. I have to say that I found the main story really engrossing, even if I'd heard some spoilers beforehand. If their was one criticism to be had with the story, it's that the latter half of the game doesn't quite manage to meet the standard of the first half, with the plot becoming a bit too convoluted, and difficult to follow.GameplayThe gameplay in Final Fantasy VII is good, but nothing spectacular. Being an JRPG, a good deal of gameplay is taken up by turnbased battles. The combat system is simple enough for beginners, but also has enough technique for more experienced players. This makes for several fun battles, although a large number of random encounters, as well as summon attack cutscenes which can take up to two minutes to play out, can make them seem a bit repetitive. I enjoyed the battles for the most part although some of them towards the end of the game, I found very frustrating .As well as battles there are also several minigames such as motorbike chases, or snowboarding which you can try out. These can be fun, but I didn't try them out much. Outside of battles and minigames, you will travel across the world and explore caves, and towns. This is easier said than done, as the static backgrounds can be quite hard to traverse.GraphicsIt's no secret that Final Fantasy VII's graphics are a bti dated, with some characters looking like lego, but I genuinely didn't mind them that much. They have been sharpened for this release, and some of the battles actually look quite decent. There are several cutscenes as well, which look quite good for the time.MusicIf there's one thing which is easy to agree on about Final Fantasy VII, it's that it has great music. From killer battle tracks, to heart wrenching leitmotifs, this game has some of the best and most memorable music I've seen in a game. Mr. Uematsu, I salute you.VerdictFinal Fantasy VII is an amazing game with a memorable story, some fun battles, and a killer soundtrack. Even the occasional frustrating moment, doesn't stop this from being an incredible game.10/10			"

The game that sold the PlayStation Final Fantasy VII is adored by young and old around the world. The game's various versions have sold over 11 million units as of 2015, and it remains popular to this day. If you've never heard of it, then where the hell have you been?!The story has an excellent premise, as evinced by the extensive efforts of Square Enix to milk the universe of all its worth (spin-offs include Crisis Core, Dirge of Cerberus, and even a movie, Advent Children, among others). You start with Cloud Strife (employed as a mercenary) and long-time friend Tifa Lockheart as members of eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, under the command of Barrett Wallace. The underlying belief of the group is that the planet's life energy is being consumed by Shinra Corporation's reactors, slowly but surely destroying the planet. The group organise attacks against the reactors in the belief they are saving the planet. These events are eventually dwarfed by a new threat to the planet: Sephiroth.The game has done well over the years thanks to a whole plethora of reasons that help make it come alive, and it often stays alive in the minds of gamers long after players have experienced it. The engaging story, of which I have only touched upon here, is littered with so many twists and turns and shocking discoveries that you'll likely be dizzy with awesomeness by the end of it.Gameplay is much the same as previous titles, using the standard random encounter mechanic we all know and love to initiate fights with monsters or people. Equipment is limited to one weapon and one armor at a time, but these can have various materia slots. Materia is crystallised Mako, or lifestream energy, and is the source of many abilities and enhancements characters can make use of in the game, not the least of which is magic spells, summons, auto-abilities and stat boosts. Materia can be levelled, and once mastered can spawn a duplicate materia, allowing much customisation and experimentation.The game really is an emotional rollercoaster. The characters are a lot more fully realised than many of those in previous titles in the series - Barrett's concern for Marlene, Tifa's concern for Cloud ... even some of the Turks inspire our empathy at times (eg, Reno and Rude deciding they are 'off-duty' in regard to orders to search for Cloud, after working together briefly). Cloud's cross-dressing scene is good for a laugh. People are killed. Truths are learnt. A good game is a game that holds our attention, and that is what FFVII and its characters do as we strive to know more about what is happening and why. Indeed, the shock death of one of our own team members definitely added to the game's infamy. Most of you already know who I'm talking about. And perhaps because of this, Sephiroth is often lauded as one of, if not the, greatest game villain of all time. I know my own feelings are a mix of admiration and hate when I think of him.The art style was a leap ahead in its time, but in today's world of newest releases it does have a dated feel to it, with chunky 3D graphics on par with much of the earliest games to implement 3D graphics. On the PC version little has changed, although it has been criticised for its lower quality graphics, installation and framerate problems. I did not experience any problems personally, and have come to not expect vast improvements in framerate from FF re-releases.Some would say the PS version is more impressive - I myself cannot say as I never got around to playing that version. It does seem as though Square Enix has only done the bare minimum to get the game to work on PC - a trait shared by many FF PC ports, much to the disgust of expectant PC FF fans.The music is excellent, but many of its most loved tracks have been reworked for Advent Children, and it is these versions I enjoy the most, especially One-Winged Angel. As it happens, the FFVII version is also composer Nobuo Uematsu's favourite from the soundtrack, and his favourite battle theme from any Final Fantasy game.Some cons I believe are worth noting:- Cheap final boss fight, impossible to lose- A minority might find the plot very confusing to grasp as more facts are brought to lightI would have listed the game's linear nature, but this isn't so bad when you consider it as a trade-off for good story. Also to make up for this are the game's various mini games, helping to beef up an already impressive game. There is a barrel pushing game in the Sector 5 Church, a 'squats' mini game at the Wall Market, a sneaking game in the Shinra Building, in addition to various mini games that can be played at the Gold Saucer, including G Bike, the Fort Condor strategy minigame, and of course the chocobo racing game, among others. Some of these are easy while others can be hard.With the inclusion of Steam achievements, there is plenty for the aspiring completionist to aim for. Be sure to add this piece of gaming history to your library, you won't regret it.			"

												7/10 In 1997, one of the most influential, inspiring, and standard-setting RPG's ever was released: Final Fantasy 7. In fact, it was the #1 best selling game in the series' history, and one of the best selling games of the time. FF7 ""sold the Playstation"" (according to Wiki). It pushed the petty PS1 to astronomical levels above and beyond what it was intended for. Square had developed a game so indepth, so massive, that it took THREE discs just to contain it all! Great writing, beautiful story telling, breath-taking art, and a soundtrack that will sweep your mind away and invoke so many emotions are the words to describe this....AND SQUARE FREAKIN' RUINS IT WITH THIS PC RELEASE! First of all, DRM. Yap, DRM...FOR A SINGLE PLAYER GAME! I almost saw past  this, then the unimaginable happened: THEY CHANGED THE SOUND EFFECTS AND THE MUSIC FROM THE ORIGINAL. UN...FORGIVABLE. The new music and sounds are literally painful. A guide here on Steam shows how to get the original music, but what was Square thinking?! If you can get the work around for the music to work (or use youtube like me), see past the DRM, and fight the weird PC controls, one of the greatest games ever made lies hidden behind it all. I don't even know if I should recommend this or not. Maybe go for the PS version instead. I feel so let down.			"

												This game was released in 1997 but I still doubt it was crafted by humans. It was either a gift from the gods or was sent to us from an advanced extra-terrestial civilization.Yoshinori Kitase, when you read this, I want you to know that I love you from the deepest of my heart for making this game. And if you don't mind, I propose we have human intercourse as soon as possible.Words can not describe this game. If you missed it and you're not a graphic-spoiled Call of Duty brat, I highly recommend, no no, I force you to play this game. And now excuse me while I'm on my way to defeat Ruby and Emerald Weapon, my arch-enemies from my childhood...			"

												It's FF7, do I even need to say anything more than that? Well, for one thing, does all the hype buzzing around this 90's big budget JRPG title actually stack up to the experience of playing it? Admittedly, as a teenager when FF7 first came out, I could never get that far into the game because heart-crushingly my second hand FF7 disc two would not ever properly load, hence I never made it past the first disc.. So, considering this was pretty much my first time playing through the game, in some sense my opinion about FF7 is as unbiased as one can get for a RPG of this stature and age. I can safely say, that yes, this is a great experience! While FF7's combat may seem dull at first glance, it's actually rather deep if you dig into it and if you're like me and enjoy trying out new build combos then it's definitely worth poking around and experimenting with. There are several extensive side quests based around finding ""secret"" items that will make you and your party stronger.. The game's plot is done well, mainly due to the strong characters.. The game slowly leads you along each character's past, but never fully gives you everything.. This type of story approach kept me constantly wanting more!So yeah, go play this game!			"

												This game is the peak in the videogame industry, you have the best plot ever made but with some missing things that you have to guess. It contains the most known spoiler in the videogame history, and one of the most known antagonist as well...and he is not evil just because no reason, it has a very deep reason.STORY/PLOT 10/10The best story in a videogame. Deep plot involving: Contamination problems, fighting a nemesis (which you don't want to kill, just make him come to reason), discovery extra things in the story, the saddest spoilerS (yeah one in the middle and one near the end, but it is better described in Crisis Core).CHARACTERS 10/10The best antagonist in a videogame, it's not ""bad"" for no reason, and over time you don't want to kill him, just understand his reasons and stop him from his main objetive.You could think that you have more developed characters than others (I'm talking about their past) but when you do all their extra things you know you have been mistaken (even with the optional characters)COMBAT SYSTEM 9/10Of course the combat system is static, but imagine being the first FF having animations in the battles (attacking, preparing attacks, covering allies, etc, and the bosses as well). You can equip everyone with any materia, the only differences among them are the limits, some stats and some equipment of course. Some summons could be anoying to watch (specially Knights of the Round). Once you reach high lvls and equipment/materias there is no more challenge than Weapons (optional bosses spreaded over the map)GRAPHICS 9/10I know that some videogames had better graphics back then, but this was the first FF with: a) 3d characters/enemies (with a proper appearance for your chars inbattle...no more dwarf chars against well drawn non-animated enemies)b) 3d to 2d rendered spaces, you could think it's not good, but it gave them the opportunity to show a lot of detailed things within the places, and you don't have the same houses/buildings structures over and over in a town/city anymore.c)being a pre rendered 2d place, you don't have popping textures which they were present in almost every game in that gen (it was normal then)GAMEPLAY 10/10I did split ""gamplay"" from ""combat system"" for three reasons:First: no more party splits to solve puzzles (If you played FFVI you know how anoying it could be without no-encounters).Second: the 3d map now looks the most alive map in a FF so far, so you really feel like you are discovering new places every time, and now you have more vehicles.Third: a lot of minigames in the game, defending a fortress, doing sport, chocobos(very anoying if you don't have a proper chocobo), snow, motorbike, etc...DIALOG 10/10It has very deep conversations sometimes, everyone has something to say, maybe the only ""bad"" thing in this game is the translation (at least the spanish translation is known as the worst translation ever made)MUSIC 10/10Nobuo Uematsu made a very good job here, this soundtrack not only has a lot of memorable songs, it has the sephiroth theme, used in the next FFVII games, and (of course) KH sephiroth battle. I think I can say that there is not another song that identifies a videogame character like this song does.CONCLUSIONThe best PSX game (I know, the closests to this one are MGS and CTR). The best plot in a videogame. OPINION ABOUT THE UPCOMING REMAKE:I played and enjoyed this masterpiece a lot of times. I totally agree with a remake, and I would like to see a new combat system, because I have the old combat system in this game.I want new stories within the game, new characters if they are needed or showing more content that we could have not seen before.People think that a bad remake could destroy the game, but I don't think so, the FFVII was done and finished 20 years ago, you are not touching that game, you are making a new one, if it is a bad remake, it doesn't matter, you have the old game forever, and even better, you could be the guy which always says: ""the original was better"", ""if I wanted to play FFVII I wouldn't play this♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, etc.			"

												This is ""The"" Final Fantasy game for a lot of people. The holy grail. The best of them all. The pinicle of the series.Do I think that? No, actually, I don't. I liked IX more than VII personally. However, I do still enjoy this game and I do recommend it. Don't let my play time fool you, I've got 3 complete playthroughs under my belt on the PS1 and I recently purchased this PC version so I can always have it on hand.This game holds a special place in a lot of people's hearts because it was the very first 3D final fantasy game and it has a story that hooks you early, and keeps you going throughout.It's very important to keep in mind that this game came out in 1997. 17 years ago at the time of this review. That's nearly two decades, and this PC release of the original PS1 game is by and large the exact same graphically. They did slightly upgrade the character models and portraits, but they're still just as blocky as they were then.A downside with the PC release is the MIDI sound files are not the best of quality. That can be modded though, if you're feeling rather adventurous as modding is not a built in feature so it takes following some guides to know what files to replace and in what folders. The graphics can also be modded to make the game look more recent than it really is, but with these you have to be a bit more careful as the most popular set of mods will make you unable to gain achievements in the game or use the cloud saves. That is because the mods were created for the original PC release of the game, and not this much more recent Steam release and no one has gone through the effort of porting all those mods over to work with the Steam version to keep achievements active.The game itself has a standard RPG story that you'll come to expect from Final Fantasy games, and as you probably know it is highly regarded by many. VI and VII are by and large the absolute most popular Final Fantasy games, and that's likely always to be the case. I really don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into specifics.A unique feature of the game is its materia system, which is a system where your weapon and armor has slots in which you can equip materia that gives you access to a specific spell. This allows you to take your characters and build them up with exactly the spells you want them to have, but you can switch it up to meet any paticular challenge without any penalties. This is particularly nice because it allows you to put the characters you most care about into your active party and not be punished for doing so. Characters still maintain a unique identity through their limit break skills. The only exception being that through much of the game you are required to use the main character, Cloud, but you're free to pick and choose the other two fairly early in the game.For a very early PS1 game, it still features a lot of content like an overworld map, travel by airships, mini-games, optional super bosses, etc. Now, while it has an overworld map don't be fooled into thinking it's open world. It isn't. Like most of the Final Fantasy games it is by and large linear, but at about the halfway to 2/3 mark you do start to get more freedom in where you go. It's linear in that while you can wonder around the map, natural barriers prevent you from going too far from where you are suppose to get until you advance the story and unlock new modes of transportation.Overall I do think this is a good game, and worth playing through at least once if you have not done so. If you've already played through the game once before on a different system and are just curious what the changes are, I'd probably skip this as the changes in graphics is minimal.			"

												I heard people say this was the best Final Fantasy and they were right.If you never played this game or any other final fantasy what are you doing with your life?10/10 needs more chocobosEdit: I have over 250 hrs of this game and imo this has to be one of the best rpgs out there and if you are a fan of them get this game, it will not disappoint.I still havent completed this game due to buying many games and never completing them, but sometime in the future I plan to go back to this game and finish it.My Experience so far (No Spoilers): So far with my experience with this game has been great, the gameplay is fluid which you have turns attacking in real time with the classic Final Fantasy gameplay, idk about you but I really like these old poly graphics which have a charm and a place in my heart ;), story wise this game has a lot of climatic moments which makes you keep on playing more and has 3 discs which you don't have to switch since when you get to a certain point you can save and quit or continue. I'm really happy I decided to buy this game because, it holds a special place in one of my favorite games and perhaps my favorite rpg but, if you still haven't bought this game buy it, period.			"

												Boy, oh boy. How I usually avoid writing these kind of things.So you know, whether or not this 'review' has a thumbs down is completely irrelevant.I have a fond place in my memories for this game and it will always sit there, regardless of this ports overall quality.It's by far and wide not my favourite of the series, but it sits high on the list.That said, this is a passable port at best. At it's worst it's an OLD port of the original PC release.The music, while seemingly a huge issue for some didn't even register with me.The needless always online DRM for a game I've been playing since 1998 is also not a selling point, but once you've signed up for an account, it just becomes a minor hurdle to get into your game (not wholly unlike the Steam service itself). It's more a mark of the times in which we live than an actual mark against the game.At face value, all of what made Final Fantasy VII such a fan favourite is still very much present in this port.But recently sitting down to an in-depth playthrough (My first actual playthrough since buying the game on Steam) has brought some... Light issues to my attention.- Graphics:No, no. This isn't a ""Man, why do all the characters look like Popeye?"" kind of graphical issue, this is more of a ""Why update the models but not their faces?"" issue.As mentioned the models are updated, looking smoother with less pixelation on the edges, the characters really stand out against the background (sometimes they even stand out against the foreground for no reason) and it runs beautifully smooth, rarely any sign of frame lag. But as I said, the faces for the characters seem to have been lifted straight from the Playstation version and then plastered onto the new models.Beyond that there are a couple of fascinating new gltiches/oversights that I've noticed. First of which being the gaped, open-mouth vacant look most characters seem to have. The most hilarious example being Sephiroth. Man, is it hard to take Aeris' death seriously when Sephiroth is standing over her the whole time with his mouth wide open THE WHOLE TIME.The second facial issue I noticed while inside the HoneyBee Inn's Group Room.Obviously, there are some copy-pasted dudes in that room, that's no secret, but did you noticed the black guys have blonde eyebrows whenever they blink? It's not even limited to them...Remember the scene where Barret and Dyne lose their arms? Well the moment where Barret recoils from being shot in the wrist there's a fabulous close up of his face, blone eyebrows and all.- Controls:If you're playing using your Keyboard, congratulations, you're clearly more patient than most of us...If you're playing using a Gamepad... Again, You're probably more patient than any of us.The button configuration for this game is a logistical nightmare and the games outirght refusal to relay meaningful information about what the buttons actually do is a hurdle I certainly could have done without.This is a complaint from someone who is admittedly not a ""seasoned PC gamer"". So I'm not all too familiar with the buttons on my keyboard that don't type words or relate to something in photoshop. Nor do I know which button is ""button 4"" or whatever on my wired 360 controller. So that is on me. I'll freely accept that I could be better informed in this instance.However, if I plug my controller in to play a pre-analog game from 1997 and for reasons never explained there is no D-Pad support what-so-ever, then yes. I'd call that an issue.If I have to run Joy-To-Key in the background of a port of Final Fantasy VII so that I don't have to manipulate menus with an analog stick then someone in the process of this port wasn't working hard enough.I will say though, once I got Joy-To-Key worked into the equation, navigating the world with the analog and switching to D-Pad for battle menu navigation felt so much better than the original experience on the Playstation. So, analog support is a pro, but no D-Pad option negates it entirely.For some people I understand that this won't sound like a big problem ""Oh boo-hoo! You had to configure the buttons to your liking on a PC game!"" And normally, those people would be right... Kind of.But with a port of a Playstation game, that is as much-beloved as this one I'd like to imagine that maintaining as much of the original experience as possible would be the most important thing to the developer.Making the controls wonky to the point of needing outside assistance to work is counter-active to that goal.And if you can't have fun controlling a game, then it's hardly an experience worth paying for in my opinion.So all together, there are some minor and now I think about it, really funny graphical glitches and the controls are so poorly handled that chances are you'll spend more time trying to work out how to make it all go then you ever will saving the world from slack jawed Sephiroth.The game as is, isn't the most offensive port I've ever played but it's a ways off being one of the best. Like I said at the start, at best it's passable, at worst it's old and nothing learned from the years before this release was ever implemented.My verdict? Well chances are if you liked this game already then you've likely bought it before even reading this. If not, I'd suggest buying the PSN port instead if you can, as it's essentially a 1 to 1 version of the original Playstation and requires less set-up and is no where near as fiddly controller-wise.

												Overall Score: 9.85/10       ---------------------------------------Concept: 10The story is great, the characters are interesting and fun, Open world exploration and at some parts a little linearity (is that a word?). Not too much to say about it.---------------------------------------Graphics: 9.75Graphics are... ok for its time i guess. Many people would have liked to seen an HD remake of this game, but what we got was just a little polished version of the ps1 version, but for its time the game looked pretty solid!----------------------------------------Sound: 10Amazing music. just... just amazing. Beautiful. Catchy. Awesome. so much variety in the music styles seen in the game as well. Perfect 10.----------------------------------------Playability: 9.75Only Playability problem with this game is the controller support. The game supports controllers, and a good amount of them, but it would be nice if the game maybe said ""press A"" or ""press Y"" for my Xbox 360 controller instead of ""press BUTTON12"" because I sure as heck don't remember the numbers for all the buttons, and at certain times this led me to pressing random buttons until it works.----------------------------------------Entertainment: 9.75Very entertaining game, you get really involved into the story and the characters, alot of variety, fun, and exploration. Only minus was at certain times having no clue where to go, with no objective marker or mission status telling you where, which left you wondering around an open world for a good while wondering where to go (but some people like doing this)			"

												What the ^@#$!....My pride was wounded on this one. I love this game and still mark it as my favorite videogame ever, but I cant in good mind recommend this pc port to anyone. The game is great don't get me wrong, but the resolution wasn't changed from the low low resoultion they used to use for TVs and it shows. I just bought this on steam right after playing it on a emulator and omg....the textures  EVERYWHERE look utterly terrible and fuzzy compare to it (litterally 2 to 3 times worse) (why isn't anyone mentioning this!). I would normally  recommend you buy a game to show your support for it, but this IS one of the most well known games in the world. Do your self a favor and download a common emulator to play this game instead, where people at least showed the love and care this game deserves on a pc port instead of....this...TLDR: Textures are much much lower resolution and fuzzier than any emulator has on this game. Do yourself a favor and emulate it where people gave it the love and care it deserved.			"

												Ahh this game brings back memories from playing on the Playstation. Remember when you had to login to your square/enix account in order to start the game?Remember having to click START with the mouse, and then having to press X on the keyboard to start the game for some reason, even though you had a gamepad in hand?Remember that day when the internet went out and you couldnt play FF7 due to sQeNix online always insistent connection?Friend: Hey, how come your not playing FF7?Me: Oh, the internet is down, but thats ok... Its worth it for Cloud saves and achievements such as: ""use characters limit break"". I love you Square-Enix! Please hurry up and make Final Fantasy 13-5: Lightning takes Samba lessons.All that aside, its still the best way to play this game. however, When you are playing games from Steam Big Picture, Having to pull out a mouse and keyboard just to start a game that is designed for gamepad play really irritates me. Thumbs down mostly because all these ""Features"" keep an other wise perfect release from getting out of the mud.			"

												Let's put it like this: FF7 PC version is basically FF7 playstation version, but not. Here are some notable differences you should keep an eye out for.-Every character inexplicably has some kind of a mouth. Cloud has a :| face all the time, Tifa and Aeris are c:, and literally every NPC (including Sephiroth himself!) suffers from a debilitating case of open mouth syndrome. Please keep them in your hearts and prayers.-The game loads faster, and because of this, some of the sequenced music sequences (like the tiny bronco taking off) are off sync.-You can warp into the debug room with seemingly random saves and loads.

												Good freaking god, there is not enough I can say about how awesome this game is. This defined my childhood. The story, while cheesy, keeps you going and has some twists that defined an enitre generation. The Materia system is one of my favorite systems Square has used for one of their games and allows for infinite combinations for your characters in battle. Plus it has an enitre Chocobo breeding and racing minigame that will take you hours to clear.If you've an RPG fan and have never played this game, buy it. I'm certain you wont regret it.			"

Why in the world do I need to sign in to a stupid website and answer a bunch of questions to play a game that is 20 years old!?  No wonder people just download illegal ROMS.

												An almost decent port sadly sabotaged with several problems making it impossible to recommend.Its controller support is sadly lacking. With no way to assign the d-pad to up/down/left/right I'm forced to use the analog stick, which for this game (and its constant awkward movement angles) is seriously debilitating.Cloud saving is apparently not working right now, which meant when I hit the first save point I actually couldn't save at all - even though it's telling me it's using local files, it just errors with a 'save file not found' first time I try to save.It forces you to create a Square Enix account and 'log in' just to play the game - which is unnecessary and obnoxious, especially since the only benefit to the player, cloud saving, doesn't seem to be working, at least for me.There are no graphical improvements here, so all in all I feel I'm better off running the original PSX version in an emulator than running this. Unless you really have a desire to collect achievements for some dumb reason...			"

												It kills me to give this game a thumbs down. It is a great game but Squares ""Registration and Account Tracking Services"" TOS is insane. It gives Square permission to examine and take anything they want from your computer or phone. I dunno why square would smack the customers that support them in the face like this.I never pirated a piece of software in my life before FF7, and I actually paid for thios atrocious steaming pile of malware garbage on steam, but I have installed the cracked version because it doesn't require me to give my PC and phone to square. I am loving the game...and I intend to get clean versions without the ""Registration and Account Tracking Services"" of the other FFs.It just bums me out that the actual developer can release such a crummy paid version, I would have liked to support square because they used to make awesome games, but if they would rather their customers surf the crack sites in order to get clean versions of thier product so be it.Really bummed about this....

												I can't tell you how many times I have played Final Fantasy VII. It is perhaps my favorite Final Fantasy ever, and I know many will agree with me. There is a reason why they made several other games and a movie based on the Final Fantasy VII universe.Positive:- Cut-scenes still look good- Game-play still great- Story still holds up (it still excites me even though I know what will happen)- Oh my God, the music- The materia system is so incredible. It is so fun and rewarding to experiment with different materia combinations. It is by far my favorite magic/equip system of all Final Fantasies- Plenty of side-quests, side-stories, mini-games, and collectables- Some extremely challenging boss-fights Negative:- Plenty of little glitches (none that are game breaking from what I know)- All those polygons (old graphics)- Turn based battle system - don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the system to this day. However, many magic/skill animations (especially summons) take a lot of time, are unskippable and ruin the flow of battle. - Some battle abilities take so long to complete (especially summons)- Damage cap at 9999- It can be difficult for new playersConclusion:I understand that it can be difficult to convince someone to buy Final Fantasy VII. For me, it's main selling point is the nostalgia. If you have no emotional ties to this game, it's basically an old game with a dated turn-based battling system. However, if you are willing to give Final Fantasy VII a shot, you will not regret it. The story is captivating, the battles are exciting, the world is vast, and the materia system is magnificent. I guarantee over 30 hours of old-school goodness.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is easily one of my favourite games of all time. In fact, I'd go as far as calling it a contender for my favourite game full stop. Whilst its age is shown in its graphics, it still holds a prime place in my heart after playing it over and over for many years, and it will continue to do so for the rest of my days.Obviously, the game isn't without its flaws. No game is. However, FFVII has few of them. The main flaw is its plot holes during some of the flashback sequences. However, these are mostly due to translation errors and censored content outside of Japan, so that's not really the game's fault. However, a vast majority of these relate more to the lore of the world rather than the events of this game in particular, and are explored in more detail throughout the other games in the FFVII collection. The very few that apply to this game in particular can be found within the game, but through optional quests, which isn't too bad. The other big flaw is the occasional use of compulsory, story related minigames that tend to break the pacing a bit. However, it could be much worse, as many games of the time were, when it comes to pacing, as a vast majority of the rest of the game deals with pacing in a relatively superior manner.Of course, to be a game that many gamers consider the most influential and most iconic JRPG of all time, as well as one of the top 3 PS1 games of all time (according to a poll that PlayStation ran, alongside Crash Bandicoot and Metal Gear Solid), it must do a lot of stuff right, right? That is indeed the case. Here's a list of things that are done really nicely.-Story - The story is among the best throughout all of gaming history. It's powerful, it's moving, it makes you think... You'll be hard-pushed to find a video game with a better story, even today.-The characters - The characters are amazing. The main party members are all likeable in their own way, and they are all relatable too. The bad guys are the kind of bad guys that people love to hate, which is why they are popular, and actually good villains. The chemistry between characters is well done too. -The music - FFVII has a phenomenal soundtrack. The music always matches the mood of the current location and event. The battle themes make the battles feel action packed, especially the boss themes which add tension to the fights. There are also multiple tunes in the game that are moving, and they are used to set the mood beautifully.-The gameplay - Unlike XIII, this Final Fantasy is not a corridor. Whilst it tells you where to go next, it doesn't force it upon you. It allows you to explore, finding new items and equipment, and even two extra characters. There are also numerous sidequests which you can do, should you fancy a break from the story. The battles are also fun. The battles are turn based, which some might consider a bad thing outside of Pokémon these days. However, in 1997, most RPGs were turn based, with FFVII being no exception, and FFVII has a really good battle system. It's also mildly customisable. You can make it easier and more casual by setting the game to wait for you to make your choices in your turns before attacking you, or you can make it harder by letting CPUs take their turns whilst you select, meaning you have to be faster in making your choices. As well as this, it has a wonderful ability system in the form of Materia, which allows you to customise your characters' abilities easily.Overall, this game is a masterpiece. This game proves that video games could be considered an art form when done well. With the remake around the corner, I highly recommend this masterpiece so you can see where the worldwide love for Final Fantasy VII first began. The remake will likely be an amazing game, but it won't necessarily have the charm that the original does. Play this game. If JRPGs, or story driven games in general, are your thing, I promise you that you will not be disappointed by this timeless classic.			"

FINAL FANTASY 7Reviewed by someone who's not a fanboyOpening Case:Starting about 2 years ago I decided to pickup and play every single main Final Fantasy games, I and II were lame, but cool as in: they laid the ground for other FF games, III introduced interesting mechanics, IV and V are really good even by today's standards and VI is one of the best games I've ever played, so I was a little skeptical about playing 7, I'm not much into the current/futuristic fantasy, the trend started with 7 and was only left out of 9 and 11 as far as I know, bias apart I was surprised with how many things 7 does right, changing the gameplay with minigames throughout the whole game, with a whole plaza full of them, they make a great change of pace from the repetitive gameplay, music is done spendidly with tracks ranging from smooth jazzy sounds of Midgar to hard rock battle and bosses themes.Well, that's good enough for an introduction, so here we go:Combat""But it's turned based, that's all I need to know"", says the one which all FF expiriences comes from X and on.Combat is always a big part of FF, with lots of equipment, weapons, magics, summons, skills and items. I hate to start off with a big let down however the combat is incredibly lackluster for most of the game, I got through CD1 and almost all CD2 only attacking and healing my party when battling random encounters(never needing to grind), most enemies are damage sponges, never representing any challenge at all, although that's not something I can say about the bosses, with a few exceptions every one got me exited and actually fighting against it, managing items, health, magic, summons, skills and everything that should be on most fights, even early bosses are fun to battle against using those damage items that are really crappy after 6 hours in the game; only by 2/3 og the game the battles start to become fun, by then you'll have the material necessary to battle against anything that isn't immune to stop, slow, and with your whole party on (cocaine and cannabis) haste and regen.I've got to talk a bit about summons one on one with you dear reader, they are so cool... the first two times you use them, most have a half-minute unskippeable cutscenes, and if you're up to do some good damage on bosses you'll be spamming these every big battle, and don't get me wrong the cutscenes are amazingly well made for the time, especially for the first time 3D final fantasy, but when your battle takes 13 minutes you watching the same summons only to die at the last hit and have to re-watch every single summon again is so infuriating.Graphics""But they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the same as the PS1 version, I'll wait for the awesome graphics from the remake"", Says the console peasant who is unaware of mods.Well, while it is true I can count the polygons on a model with my fingers I used a mod which changes every model to a hi-resolution with more polygons one, and I must give credit where credit is due, what an amazing job the folk that worked on The Reunion mod[forums.qhimm.com] did, here's what the game looks after the mod, there's more to the mod then just this, so I'll link the mod at the end of the reviewMinigamesThere's around 20 of these beautiful thingymajigs spreaded across the whole game, most of them are really fun and surprised me when I actually played a section that I thought it be only a FMV,  they all come with rewards depending on your performance at 'em, they provide a fun alternative to the rather repetitive gameplay.Music""The quality is awful, it's all compressed and is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to listen on my $800 razor headset"", and for that my reply is: FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE MAN, SHUT UP!Can't say much on the original soundtrack quality, but I'll be damned if not to say FF7 has one of the best soundtracks of any FF I've played, I'd say only losing to FF tactics advanced, to enjoy the whole thing at it's best quality I highly recommend(again) the The Reunion mod[forums.qhimm.com], to fully apreciate every track.Character Development""They're not even rea-"" ARGH! GET OUT!Look, here's where the game disappoints me the most, is the character development bad? No...Yes...Kind of(?), look, it really depends on who you refer to, Cloud, Tifa, Barret, and although short lived(*), Aerith's character arch are amazing, and they all are really well presented and developed, the rest of the crew really seems as if they're only there to be part of one or two importante dialogs and then thrown to the corner never to be used again, not even used on gameplay, as no character really is unique, everyone has the same basic attacks and the only difference between them is limit techniques, no one has an unique skill or ability, wich makes everyone the most blend combat characters, the good part is that one is blend and you can play with any party without having any downsides.(*)see what I did there? short lived hehe...Should you buy it? try FF 6, not the steam version, emulate it get it through legitimately means and if you really like it then I'd say yes.

												What can you say about Final Fantasy VII that hasn't already been said?  It's one of the best Final Fantasy games to date, which is easily said due to all of it's spinoffs like the absolutely thrilling Dirge of Cerbeus, the wonderful prequil Chrisis Core, and the ever popular movie Advent Children (just to name a few).That said, there are some good and bad with this Steam version of Final Fantasy VII, so lets get the list going;CONS:- Requires you to be online and sign in via Square Enix before playing.- Cloud saving is slow (2-5 min pause) and you can't Save/Load until it's ready.- No additional content added.- Subtitles have been censored, which actually removes a bit of character emotion.PROS:- Final Fantasy VII- Graphical Enhancements (allowing high resolutions).- Video and Overlayed characters are better synced.- Music has been updated (uses the higher-quality playstation audio tracks)- Subtitles have been ""repaired"" to remove ""engrish"" language.- Fully mapable keys & controller support.- Ability to disable cloud saving.So is the game something I would recommend?  Of course it is!  It's Final Fantasy 7 for cryin out loud!  But...  If you already own a copy of Final Fantasy VII on a console than there is no real reason to get this one.  There isn't any new content, just updating for modern PC technology.  That said, if you have the older PC version (and love it) then replacing it with this one might be a good idea.As far as the price, I don't actually believe this game is worth $17.  I'm willing to bet most individuals who are looking to purchase this game are doing so because they already have Final Fantasy VII and are simply looking to update it...  I purchased it during a 50% off sale for $8.49, which I consider a decent price.All in all I'm giving this a NOT recommended.  Shocked?  Well it's true that I love Final Fantasy VII but Square Enix screwed up with a few things.  First, this is a single-player only game so an internet account should NOT be a requirement.  Second, the regular price is a little high for a game that is almost 20 years old (no matter how good it is).  Third, the Cloud Save feature (which is the only real reason for being online) is so horribly slow you'd be better off going back to CD swapping.So as much as I'd love to give this a thumbs up, because I really love this game, I simply can't.

The Highest Rated JRPG


YouTube™ Video: Final Fantasy VII || The Highest Rated JRPG / Guard Scorpion Boss || Part 1 

			Views: 167		

			#FinalFantasy http://store.steampowered.com/app/39140/ ♦Add me on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/desolater_iv/ ♦Twitter: https://twitter.com/DESOLATER_IV		

I played through the entire game in 2016, so my thoughts may be different from those who played it back in 1997 when it was first released+ The gameplay is great, and generally focuses on combat with an active time turn-based battle system. This system rewards you for thinking fast, while punishing you for taking too long to choose an attack.  The mechanics can get deep later in the game as you have many skills and items to sort through and use in time sensitive situations.+ A HUGE variety of very unique and interesting creatures throughout the entire game. Every area has new enemies to face which are almost entirely different from one another. This made the game very exciting as you never knew what to expect next.+ TONS of fantastic bosses to defeat which is where I personally had the most fun. Every boss is challenging, and you really have to prepare and devise a strategy for each one or you may find yourself overwhelmed. Every boss is also very interesting visually with some being absolutely ginourmous  in size.+ The ""Materia"" system is fantastic once you learn how to use it. Basically, every weapon and armor has a number of slots that can be filled with ""Materia"" which are basically skills. These skills can be leveled up indivually to increase their power and even linked together in chains with added benefits. You can remove materia and give them to other characters at any time without losing progress. This makes all characters able to play any role at any point in the game.+ You can summon a huge variety of creatures who all have their own epic cutscenes. They are all a lot of fun to watch and are rather strong to use.+ A LARGE amount of content! A full playthrough can easily take 35hours+ + Tons of unique environments, towns, and areas to explore. It will feel as if you are traveling the world meeting new people and cultures.+ Very mature themes and language througout the game that is borderline shocking to see in a video game. Things like suicide, domestic abuse, vulgur language, and a lot of death. In one part although not technically married, Cid treats a girl named Shera like complete crap and orders her around like she's lower than dirt, and in another part Cloud (under control by Sephiroth) beats the living hell out of Aeris+ Lots of interesting characters with unique personalities and backgrounds. + Many mini-game sections that dramatically change the gameplay. One part you are riding motorcycles trying to knock down enemies, another part you are racing chocobos, while another part you are snowboarding down  a mountain. There are many more, which do a nice job of breaking up the game and keeping things from getting monotonous.+ Great ending+ Loved the soundtrack. You will end up having some songs embedded into your brain.- The story was extremely confusing, vague, and a bit hard to follow at times. Near the end a lot of questions are cleared up, but you will be scratching your head throughout most of the game trying to figure out what is happening. Even at the end you will likely have a lot of questions...- The first part of the game (while you are in Midgar) is extremely slow-paced and boring in my opinion as it tries to introduce characters and the plot without much combat or action. Honestly, the game did not peak my interest until after leaving Midgar, when able to travel around the world.- This may just be a personal thing, but I had a hard time connecting to the characters. It may have just been because I'm used to voice-acted characters, and reading through dialogue was a bit dry. This especially held true for me with Aeris.- Throughout many sections of the game you will be forced to use other characters you don't use normally or have no desire in using. This wouldn't be bad in itself, but you are forced to spend a considerable amount of time removing and re-equipping materia and equipment.- The game does not hold your hand and it can be very difficult to figure out what to do, where to go, or how to progress. To avoid frustration I would say using a guide is almost mandatory.- This is a minor note, but there are addional sidequests and optional bosses you can complete near the end of the game. Unfortunetely, there are no save points leading up to the final battle / story ending so you can't go back to do these opional bosses afterward which can be annoying.			"

												Awesome game loved it since the day it came out on Playstation. The game isn't the problem here. When I purchased and downloaded it there's a log in(yes LOG IN) screen I had to go through. You have to make a Square Enix account to play this game. Normally this is just an inconvenience. However, when I made my account the log in screen didn't accept it. That's right. The Square Enix log in screen for a Playstation game that came out nearly two decades ago did not accept my freshly made account. After numerous attempts and password resets, it finally let me in. After playing for several hours and taking a break, I come back to find out the Cloud Saves did not process. HOURS of gameplay gone. The Satanic login screen combined with the failing Cloud saves is enough for me to uninstall this game and just play it through an emulator, which looks just as good and works better.....with no LOGIN SCREEN!

												O.k I have to Review.I was almost hesitant to buy this because their are a lot of gamers on steam that worry the most about 1st world problems.I have played this game literally 12 hours straight, and had absolutley no problems. Nothing with sign in, no confusing controls, no problem with the server's or connection or whatever.The 12 hours I spent on this were straight nostalgic bliss.Every mission, every character, every inch of the gameplay is just as I remembered within FF7 from its original copy on PS.If you are hesitant because of all the negative reviews, don't listen to them at all.

												If you don't mind square enix forcing you to make an account with them and forcing you to accept that they will monitor you and make you take cookies every time you play this game, then this is the old classic for you!However if you don't like that companies can force you to give up your privacy and become their little b____, then i recommend you find something else.

												I have barely made it halfway through the main campaign and I already have over 90HRS of playtime! This is an excellent title by Square Enix and in my personal opinion, one of the best Final Fantasy games I have ever played! To define and enhance the defition of a(n) RPG is what Square Enix set out to do in 1997 and not only did they succeed but they re-shaped the entire existence of a Role Playing Game! Getting into the actual gameplay of FF7 the charcters and world are designed in a blocky format however the worlds and characters are still quite detailed and an enjoyable sight.It's up to you whether or not you enjoy this element of the gameplay. The storyline is detailed and fits quite well into the previous and post franchise story line of the Final Fantasy franchise. As for the combat system it's a mix between turn-based and real-time-stratagy that combines all you may love or hate, tbh I would have preferred if it was one or the other for the combat but either way it's a simple system that i don't believe anyone can truely ""hate"". When it comes to negativity about the game there isn't much I can say however it gets quite grindy at certain parts of the story and if you're planning to enter the game blind then you should know that sometimes it leaves you with no idea of where to go and you may have to search for up to 1/2 an hour to check out every single place on the map you may need to go to.Personally I love the FF franchise and of course this game, therefore I would strongly advise you get the game and if you're sitting on a fence, check it out rather I hope this helps someone decide whether or not they should buy FFVII and thx for reading! :)			"

												SQEX's awful secondary DRM requires a security token from their servers (to play a 20 year old single player game). Wouldn't be a huge issue if their customer support actually worked.However, hugely nostalgic port for those who used to play, and if you're into old JRPGs, I strongly recommend this game. Login servers seem a bit shoddy sometimes, but other than that, I can't complain. Good controller support if your joystick/controller has similar mapping to a PSX.			"

												Simply my favourite game of all time... yet I still prefer playing the game on a PS1 emulator. Practically nothing that has been added to the game since 1997 has been an improvement. I guess it looks a little better, but that's it. The character boosters are a joke and the input method hasn't been updated at all, so using a controller is a mess of unclear configuration options and button prompts. Having to create a Square Enix account to play it almost feels insulting. If you have a PS4, get it on that instead. Not recommended.			"

												Greatest game of all time. I played it some when I was a kid but I just got it for steam a couple years ago and literally got hooked. I love this battle system, how I can relax and play this game while watching TV and don't really have to sit there steady pressing buttons. Summons are great. You unlock them as you progress and my favorite part is the different ways you can pair materia. You can put Quad Magic with Meteor 2 and use W-Magic to hit them with over 20 meteors, using MP Turbo on Meteor to make it do 9999 over 20 times. I'll play this game for the rest of my life			"

The first was for the original PSX, the second was the EIDOS PC port, and now I've got it on Steam.Why have I dumped so much money on this game? Because it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic.+ Soap Opera plot, yes, but you can ignore it if it's too telanovella for your mood.+ Level up everything! EVERYTHING!+ Golden Saucer indulges gambling addiction nicely. Given that I was seven when I first completed this game, I probably HAVE a gambling addiction because of the Golden Saucer.+ Cait Sith!

												*SPOILER-FREE*so, this might be my favorite game of all time, if not its a definite contender for. the materia system is definately my favorite magic/skill mechanic of any game, although not everyone seems to like it: basically your magics level independently from the characters, and can be reassigned to different people on a whim (outside combat anyway). the story, oohh the plot... i heard once that they ran short on time, and ended up making a change to the plot so they could release the game on time (actually there is other evidence that the game was never actually finished, but ill come back to that later) and that plot change is, i think, the most critical thing that has made this game as great as it is. instead of following a more traditional storyline, something i think very cliche, as they origionally intended, they did something that, when playing it for the first time, my friends actually cried. had i not been watching them i would have too. im trying REALLY hard not to spoil anything, so ill end with previously mentioned evidence of it being unfinished: there are 3 elements that dont have a magic/materia for players, but enemies can do some of them, debug room contains 3 blank materia, magic labels are things like fire2, cure3 instead of thier traditional fira, curage, etc. and some other stuff in the debug room that i cant remember.

												I'm a new comer who wanted a amazing rpg game to play I've played a bit of fallout 1 and 2 and love both of the those games but I wanted something a bit more exciting so I ran into this game my friend said he's loves it on his phone and says I should get it. So I asked around a bit more people tellling me stuff like ""buy it now you wont regret it"" and you what they were right I played this before i went to bed for 4 hours and had a awesome experience the game has great characters , great dialog , Really fun monsters to fight. It sadins me that I didn't own a playstation back then to play this game it could have been special to me. But even i just got it Its already special to me. Go now and buy and have a wonder ful time like i did great game on the winter sale.Oh you may be wondering how's the steam port well it has better resoulotion ,slighty better graphics (you can switch back to old graphics) , and the best one is it plays at the same fps as it would on the playstation.My only conplaint is there are black lines on the sides but they probaly could not have fixed that.Anyway if you do get the game i hope you enjoy it as much as i am and have a merry christmas :)			"

												One factor that everybody fails to mention in their review, is the fact that once you finaly register with Square Enix you can't log in to the game till you have link steam to your new profile on the Square Enix website. Once this is done you don't have to worry about the log in at the start of Final Fantasy VII ever again. For those that are queries, just follow these simple steps.;1.) once you have finaly gotten your e-mail verify2.) while logged in on Square Enix's website click on your account name in the top right corner 3.) choose User Settings4.) click on Link Account5.) click on the link button next to steam6.) Follow directions from steam to allow the Link7.) Enjoy Final Fantasy VII			"

												This is a good game. Even though some parts of it are confusing and sad, it still is good. You do have to make a Square Enix account for a 1997 singleplayer game, but that's really the only bad thing. If you want the graphics to be better, then buy the upcoming remake or just install mods to make the game look better. The game can also be frustrating at times, but you'll eventually get past what you're stuck on. I recommend to buy this game if you haven't yet. The music is also great. So, go ahead and buy this (on a sale if you don't want to pay the $12)!			"

												Final Fantasy VII is one of those games that everyone knows. It was revolutionary when it first came out for the PS1, and was one of the best selling games of 1997. The PC port is amazing. The original soundtrack was replaced with a newer soundtrack, and the graphics were also dramatically improved. I, personally, did not enjoy the music that was put into the PC port of this. However, with the aid of mods, I was able to replace the PC soundtrack with the classic PS1 soundtrack.  The PC port also offers 3 different graphics choices, depending on the preferences of the user. The user can choose between the PS1 graphics, or the PC graphics, as well as a mod that gives combat 3D graphics. One downside of this game, is the fact that you have to create a Square Enix account to play. This was a disappointment for me, but not enough to keep me from playing it. Aside from the technical aspects of this game, the gameplay is amazing. This is by far, the best game I have ever owned, because of the great story, the great soundtrack, the amazing combat, and the replayability. After spending over 500 hours on this game over three different game systems, I won't be stopping any time soon. I highly recommend FFVII, and honestly, this game is worth much more than $11.99.			"

As i previously mentioned, i had to consult guides online to help me get directions. However, without any guidance, you would have great fun exploring the massive world this game has to offer. (Of course, There is great joy to playing with the occasional guidance too.)Its an RPG. Do what you want. Have fun. Buy it.			"

												Maybe it's just the time that I live in. The game's good and the music's cool and everything, but... Did people really care that much for these emotionless-looking blocks of people that consisted of two 3D polygons? Also the backgrounds are in really bad resolution and the game feels pretty slow... Especially in battles where there actually appears to be lag! Was this seriously  what the original game was like?!Look, being faithful to the original release of a game is good. I love originals more than remakes most of the time! But there are some games that are better when they're remade, such as Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver. I think Final Fantasy 7 should have an HD version by now or something? I don't know, but this original PS1 version here just isn't drawing me in as much as I thought it would. It's NOT keeping my attention... Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance? Still...EDIT: ARG! How could I forget that whole... What do you call it? DRM? Why would you do that for a game that supports no multiplayer in anyway?! And don't give me an argument involving updates... That's Steam's deal, not yours Square Enix! People hated the Xbone for pulling the very stunt you're trying to pull on me now! I have half a mind to rush over to your site and delete my account because I don't want to ever support that!!Not only that, but I hear bad rumors... Apparently the music I'm hearing is actually a low-quality version of the original? For real? Is this fixed or now? As a newbie I can't tell. But based on how you later treated FF8's Steam release... I'm starting to get the sense that I should never trust you, Square Enix.I mean, I was dissatisfied with the game already when I thought I was playing the original game! Now that I am hearing these rumors and have been reminded of this DRM horror... Which I feel SUCKERED into...What happened? Why are you doing this? I thought you were supposed to be one of the top game companies around! Don't tell me you're getting greedy and selfish too, like Microsoft is becoming and Capcom is (I hope) recovering from. It feels like these days I can only trust Nintendo and Valve to CARE for us...!			"

												We are all pretty aware that this is one of the best games ever to be released and its quality is hard to match. However, playing the steam version sometimes involves a certain degree of frustration due to the occasional crashes and bugs. I have had to use the cmd quite a few times to exit the game because of a bug that does not even allow you to properly close the application.The game itself is quite well done and the remade graphics are noticeable. I am hellbent on the idea that the game will forever stay as one of the most prominent examples of how to effectively make an RPG: its plot will make you laugh, make you cry and will give you the goosebumps too, all of this while you enjoy the work of one of the most outstanding maestros of videogame score design.All in all, a game you will not soon forget about.

												There's only one game which I own actual stuff from. A hanging wall scroll of Sephiroth, a Chocobo Crossing tee, and a keychain. Despite the recent efforts of Square Enix and despite not being the most challenging in the series, to this day it remains the absolute best Final Fantasy of all time. Don't waste your time or money on FF Online MMORPG crap or the recent FF games. THIS is the game you should be playing first. While for the newschool players the graphics will seem dated, if you can get past that, you're on to one of the best storylines in the history of JRPGs.			"

												Before you vote this review unhelpful solely due to the thumbs down, please read this: I recommend Final Fantasy VII! I highly recommend it. It's one of my favorite games of all-time. However, I do NOT recommend that anyone play this port! Please read on for details...Final Fantasy VII is acclaimed as one of the high-water marks of the role-playing genre. Many gamers, particularly RPG fans, have played through this game not once but a multitude of times. I downloaded the new Steam version and played through it one more time on my PC to assess how the game has aged.The very first thing that I noticed about the game was the chasm between how well the audio design and soundtrack have aged versus how poorly the graphics have. It becomes clearly apparent that sprites have aged far better than polygonal characters when comparing this game to an older, sprite-based games in the series such as Final Fantasy VI. Sprites carried a certain charm to them, and remain tolerable despite their lack of beauty. Polygons, for lack of a better description, just look strange and ugly. Their blockiness represents a human character far more poorly than even a sprite can. To compare it to Hollywood, sprites are like Disney cartoon of the '70s, while polygons are like the bad special effects of the '80s. The audio, however, has aged gracefully. Nobuo Uematsu's score has always been perfect for the game, and I remembered how fond I was of it the first time around immediately upon starting the game again.Final Fantasy VII, to me, was the beginning of Square's ""hit-or-miss"" character design specifically regarding western gamers. As a western gamer, I just can't see the appeal in a character like Cait Sith. While the majority of the characters still have good levels of depth and development, Cait Sith is a worthless entity who brings absolutely nothing to the game. He's a quirky stuffed toy injected into the game to please a culture that I just can't understand. Square Enix has continued down this path even further in future games, particularly in Final Fantasy XII, which saw two cherubic children as the main protagonists. Yuck. But there are some game-savers here. Cloud is such a deep and human character that it's worth playing through the game just to witness his growth. Sephiroth's villainy hasn't shown age, either. He's still one of the best gaming villains in history, a title well earned.It's obvious what to expect from the gameplay. This game is purely old school JRPG. It doesn't bother me, as it's a type of game that I once had a huge affinity for. I can jump back into the more slowly-paced, active turn-based battle systems any time and still enjoy it. To others, it may be a bit more tedious. This is especially true regarding random battles. As an old-school JRPG player, random battles are familiar to me and sort of a necessary evil. To others, the tedium may be intolerable. It's difficult for me to be objective enough to say.I've always loved the materia system. It's my favorite form of character development in any Final Fantasy game, and it holds up. Growing your materia through the management of your weapons is so much fun, and the high-level materia such as Slash-All and Double Cut really make you feel all-powerful toward the end portion of the game..The main complaint that I have about the game is an issue that never seemed to bother me before. The control of Cloud through the various pre-rendered areas is absolutely atrocious. Pressing up on the directional pad will sometimes cause him to go left or right, and pressing right or left on the pad will sometimes cause him to go down. There's no clear indication of when this will happen -- It's unique to each area. This becomes particularly annoying in areas where random battles occur. Very often I'd find myself doubling back due to this, and fighting far more random battles than I actually had to.I wouldn't be able to conclude this without mentioning the cutscenes and minigames. The idea of rewarding players with a CGI cutscene during certain parts of the game was a fresh, new concept at the time of the game's release. Seeing the devs at Square flaunt their graphical prowess was mind-blowing, and the cutscenes were unlike anything in video games at the time. They truly were rewarding, and I remember being so impressed as a 12-year old first playing this game that I recorded them on a VHS tape for later playback. The minigames were also groundbreaking, but have aged poorly. Bad control plagues many of them, specifically the motorcycle and snowboarding games. But the inclusion of these changed the genre for years; the lack of minigames in a post-Final Fantasy VII JRPG would be a strange omission for a later title.Final Fantasy VII has got its problems. In some cases, it's aged beautifully and become the historically powerful title that gamers expected it to be upon its release. Final Fantasy VII brought RPGs as a whole into the mainstream. Without Final Fantasy VII, games like Mass Effect 2 and Fallout 3 may never have been developed at all. The graphics and control, however, will be nearly unbearable to any gamer going back in time to play this game for the first time.As far as the Steam specific port that I'm reviewing here? Unfortunately... It's total trashEvery resolution that isn't 640x480 windowed looks terrible. They've upped the resolution on the characters and NPCs, but the pre-rendered backgrounds are the same so they look awful in any other resolution. And don't even think about going to 16:9. All it does is stretch the picture to fit the screen. Barf.There's also a persistent black bar along the bottom of the screen that is only ever filled in when accessing the menu. Imagine you're watching a film in letterbox, except that there's only one black bar on the bottom of the screen and no matching bar on the top. Just awful.On top of the graphical issues, Square's ridiculous DRM is present. You must log into Square Enix when you first start the game. People already hate Uplay. Why would Square do this? It's an idiotic move.I'm a die-hard PC gamer, but even I have to say that the best way to play this game in the modern day is to download the PSone port from the Playstation Store and play it on a PSP or a Vita. I wouldn't recommend the PC port to anybody that isn't looking to modify it heavily, as mods are basically the only reason to purchase the PC rerelease.People have also mentioned the music quality being subpar compared to the PS1 version, but it honestly didn't affects my experience at all. I've played through the game probably a dozen times since 1997 at this point, and while I definitely noticed the music being different, it didn't seem any worse than the original game.In conclusion, this game still remains a must-play for anyone who liked the original or any gamer looking for a history lesson. Like an old painting, Final Fantasy VII continues to be historically relevant and is worth seeing and experiencing if only to recognize the influence it had on present day gaming. But the paint has aged, and the artwork is unfortunately not quite as vibrant and stunning as it once was.Just don't play the newly released PC port. It's a bad.			"

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA English:Where do i start? You're going to jump in a long and fantastic adventure, in a fantasy world, populated by crazy creatures and wonderful, charismatic and lovable characters. Be aware though, ""fantasy world"" doesen't necessarily means ""perfect, colored and happy"". No. In this world there are death, pain, depression, corruption, broken hearts and broken dreams, avarice, homicide... This list could continue. Yes, you live in this kind of world, but you don't care at all, you're interested only in your profit. Oh, but things will change. Soon you'll rediscover emotions, passion, you'll rediscover life. You'll rediscover details of your life that will remember you that you used to be real. You used to be alive. And you can be once again. Learning the values of llove, friendship, sacrifice. When you will be called, along with your bizarre, imperfect but tight-knit group to save humanity. If this isn't enough, you got a serious problem. I shouldn't even talk about graphics or gameplay, here they doesen't count. But some people is just obsessed, so... It's a classic turn based RPG well structured, with an open world exploration outside the battles. The graphics are not new, but is remastered, pleasant for the eyes compared to the PS1 version. The difficulty is hard, the asked efforts are many. Is this not enough? Come back to Call Of Duty then. This game is effort. This game is emotion. This game is life.                     (Sorry for my bad english.)Italiano:Da dove comincio? Stai per tuffarti in una lunga e fantastica avventura in un mondo di fantasia, popolato da creature pazzesche e personaggi stupendi, carismatici amabili e ben caratterizzati. Ma attenzione, ""mondo di fantasia"" non significa necessariamente che sia un mondo perfetto, felice e colorato. No. In questo mondo esistono morte, dolore, depressione, corruzione, sogni e cuori infranti, avarizia, omicidio... La lista continuerebbe ancora. Si, tu vivi in questo tipo di mondo, ma non ti interessa particolarmente, sei interessato solo al tuo tornaconto. Oh, ma le cose cambieranno. Ben presto riscoprirai le emozioni, la passione, riscoprirai la vita. Riscoprirai particolari della tua esistenza che ti ricorderanno che una volta eri vero, una volta eri vivo. E puoi esserlo ancora. Imparando i valori dell'amore, dell'amicizia, dell sacrificio.  Quando verrai chiamato, assieme al tuo bizzarro, imperfetto, ma affiatato gruppo a salvare l'umanità. Se questo non è abbastanza, hai un serio problema. Non ci dovrebbe essere nemmeno bisogno di parlare di gameplay e grafica, qui non contano. Ma certa gente è ossessionata da cose del genere, dunque vi accontento. Il gameplay è il classico RPG a turni ben strutturato, con esplorazione open world fuori dalle battaglie. La grafica non è moderna, ma è rimasterizzata, resa piacevole agli occhi rispetto a quella per PS1. La difficoltà è alta, l'impegno richiesto è molto. Non basta ancora? Allora torna pure a giocare a Call Of Duty. Questo gioco è impegno. Questo gioco è emozione. Questo gioco è vita.			"

												There is a reason many people consider this game to be one of the best games ever made is because of the gameplay and story. Final Fantasy VII starts the player off in Midgar, a city that uses the Planet's energy to use everyday tools such as electricity. A terrorist group called AVALANCHE plan on destroying the complany thats pretty much in charge of the world, Shinra Inc. Now what does this have to do with ur character? Well Cloud used to work for the company as a First Class SOLDIER but he eventually left and is now fighting with AVALANCHE to destroy Shinra. There is another plot in the story besides taking down Shinra which is killing Sephiroth. Im gonna let the players discover how big of a role almost every character is in this game no, series. Final Fantasy VII's story is so big and explained that there are 3 parts of it. Crisis Core is before the events of Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children which is a movie which takes place 2 years after Final Fantasy VII.The presentation is simply amazing. Even though this game was first made on the Playstation 1 in 1997, the graphics still look amazing to this day. Almost everything is hand drawn such as the background but when ur enterting a train for example, the whole screen changes just to make the train move and than go back to the hand drawn background. The only reason y every character is almost entirely made out of polygons is because of the size of the game. For those who dont know, This game came with 3 discs on the PS1 so it makes sense for characters to be polygons. The gameplay is awesome and theres 2 types of it. The first type of gaming is just roaming around in the world map and through villages/towns. The second type is the Role playing. You must wait till ur time gauge fills up in order to choose wat to attack. There are diffrent kinds of magic in this game and when you level up ur materia (items to improve ur characters) u may get increased damage as well as new spells such as using Cure3 when leveling up ur materia. You not only earn EXP but u also earn AP for materia. There are also Summons in the game like in almost every Final Fantasy game. Even though u ccant skip any cutscenes of summon cutscenes, its always nice to watch some animations such as Knights of the Round (Best Summon) and Bahamut ZERO's cutscenes.I give this game a 10 out of 10 because even though this may not be acceptable graphics for this generation (2015). it still shows that u can break the limits of a PS1 by simply using more discs.

												Chances are you already know what this game is and what most people think about it. If you're reading this to find out if the PC port is worth playing, then simply, yes it is. I heard people complain about the DRM and Square Enix account nonsense before buying it and all you have to do is make a Square Enix account through the game launcher one time and then it'll just auto log you in every time.I heard people complain about the music problems, well thankfully they patched out the terrible midi music and put back in the original soundtrack that people remember from the PS1 so that's no longer an issue.The graphics are improved from the playstation original, they've been upscaled and look noticeably better to where this is a preferrable version to the ps1 original. There's also no compatability issues like there was in the original pc port.If you have never played this game before, buy it, it's one of if not the best JRPG of all time, and unlike later Final Fantasy games the story doesn't completely fall apart when you look through it critically.

												Final Fantasy VII - The game that defined an era.One of the greatest games, arguably on any console from any time. Final Fantasy VII is another epic installment from the Final Fantasy franchise, which needs no introduction. Released well over a decade ago, Final Fantasy VII still lives on in the memories of almost every RPG fan. Wether you played it when it was first released, or you are just trying it for the first time today, be prepared for a journey like no other. Join Cloud Strife, a seemingly selfish, arrogant mercenary as he fights at first for himself, but as the story progresses, maybe there is more to Cloud than you might think.With an entire host of unforgettable characters, journey through a mass world, visiting huge cities, quiet coastal towns, beach resorts and much more, all backed with an incredible soundtrack by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu, this is a game that will not let you down, not the first time, not the tenth time. Final Fantasy VII truely is, one of a kind.			"

												I know the actual game-play of this game is good, because I own the game on the PlayStation. I bought this PC game to  support the future development of Final Fantasy games on the PC platform, however if this is the way Square Enix plans to treat the PC platform they just shouldn't support it at all.I was aware of the DRM when buying. Having a single Square account seemed easy enough to handle and I was craving some nostalgia. So I created a Square account, but apparently it takes a while for the game to register an account creation because it didn't immediately register that my account was valid. I tried logging in on the opening screen for thirty minutes to no avail, but when I came back two hours later Square was finally ready to let me play my game. But when I started playing, I found myself in a fresh new nightmare.The controls are atrocious with a keyboard. To keep things short, in order to interact with people, doors, and items in the game the character must be facing the object. The buttons are too sensitive and if I don't take my fingers off the movement keys at exactly the same time the character moves to face which ever key I take my finger off last, even if it's last by less than a millisecond, making the character turn in a direction the item is not in. It is infuriating to try to talk to people or open doors because of this sensitivity. I found my self trying many times just to interact with characters.In order to not deal with this issue, I tried plugging in a controller- and the controller just as bad as the keyboard; the only way to move a character using a 360 controller is with the joy stick, the game IGNORES the directional pads altogether. It feels so wrong using the joystick in this game. Complaining about feeling may be nit-picky to some, but after spending so much time playing the original FFVII using the directional pad and playing all the other FF games using a directional pad, I have the question why Square willfully made this game ignore them. The PS3 and PSP versions of this game do not force players to use the joysticks, why do PC players, who normally enjoy the freedom of choice, get the short end of the stick with this game? I bought the game for nostalgia, and without good controls there is definitely no nostalgia.At every turn, even from first booting it up, it seems Square Enix did not want me to play the game. So I have not played this game. I'll probably come back to it when I'm less infuriated, but ,if you buy it, do know this game comes with issues that Square Enix willfully put in the game.			"

												Gonna be honest, people complaining about the whole ""Square Enix account"" thing are just lazy. Seriously, take the extra minute to make your account, sign in & be over with it. It's simple. Easy. Really. Then, you know what you get in return for spending a few minutes to put forth some work to sew your crop? You get to reap the reward, & that reward is this awesome game.

I have however, spent the last 25 minutes trying to confirm my ♥♥♥♥ing email for my square enix account, which is required to launch this 20 year old game. Now I've finally had it confirmed, yet the game launcher won't recognize it and does not give me an option to switch accounts or login with a different source.♥♥♥♥ you Square Enix, I wish I pirated your damn game.

												What's to be said, It's a Legendary game.  Many peoples first foray into the Final Fantasy or in some cases the JRPG genre as a whole.  Graphically dated but gameplay holds up.  Materia System is fantastic, one of the best magic arranging/levelling systems in a game in my opinion.  Adult characters, adult oriented storyline, big swords, guns, monsters chocobos... etc.  If you haven't played it, you should.  If you have, you should again.			"

												Oh well...here goes the two cents from someone who didn't play it when it was originally released by the PSX, and for how long have I regretted it. Finally, Square gave us the pleasure of delivering it to Steam and despite some of the aspects of the game haven't actually aged that well (the first 10hrs of gameplay or so do get a bit tedious) the fun suddenly snowballs and I've ended up enjoying this game a lot. It certainly lived up to the expectations I had on it and that's saying a lot.The active turn battle and the Materia system open the field for a lot of variations in your strategy, which you will have to adjust to each boss (until you get a certain Summon who is just plain broken -you know who I'm talking about-).The story of the game is certainly a thumbs up, there's a large enough variety of playable characters that you can follow up their stories and see how they grow and change without it being too tedious.Superbosses make for an incredible challenge in this game and you'll have to do your grinding before facing them and getting obliterated (yup, even with that certain broken Summon we were talking about before). If there is one thing that outweights the tedious task of grinding to defeat the bosses is the great satisfaction that such an achievement leaves behind.Be sure to play it. This will prove to be a formidable experience for almost any gamer who is ready to invest some time.9/10			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. Something about this game just draws you right into it. I never liked the Final Fantasy series as a kid and didn't find the appeal but one of my friends persuaded me to try FF7, and I reluctantly did, but never regretted it. Don't be fooled, even though this game is nearly 20 years old now, it is huge and has tons of content. There's a reason it took 3 discs on the original Playstation version.All of the main characters draw their own unique story and make you want to help their cause. The game starts out slow and easy, at first I didn't think it was going to be good, but once you get out of the starting area and unlock the world map, you'll quickly find why this game is so good. The areas, characters, and soundtrack all work together in a perfect way to deliver a very impactful story.As for the graphics and other technical details of the game, you have to remember that this game came out in 1997. Keeping that in mind, this game still looks and sounds amazing. The port to PC works great and has never crashed on me or had any issues. I do recommend a controller as that's just how the game was designed to be played, but even with a keyboard and mouse you can complete everything just fine. Using a controller adds to the nostalgic and original feel of the game, which boosts the experience though.100% recommended to anyone who is into old or classic games and like RPGs or to anyone who likes the other games in the Final Fantasy series. The story does not have any stale points and keeps you wanting to complete it all the way through! If you're planning to get the remake for Playstation 4, I recommend trying the original before or after you play that one so you can get a better feel for what FF7 is about.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is, in my opinion, the best of it's kind - crushing new games like Final Fantasy X easily. If you are capable to accept the simple graphics, you should really consider to play this game. In my opinion it has by far the best in-game and battle-system, giving the player the chance to find secrets and giving him the chance to obtain Bestias (powerful summonings which the heroes can summon at a certain state in the game) which are hidden somewhere in the game. Even though it's really old, it tried to do some easy render-sequences and if you want to the graphics are, with some know-how and troubleshooting, fully modable (be careful with spoilers while doing so). You should really try to play it some time, it served me well in 1997 aswell as now!			"

												I remember playing this years ago on my PS2 system, this game has best story i've ever seen in a game, and background music really draws you into the game, Once i started playing the game i could not stop at all and i kept playing until i 100% EVERYTHING.  I'm so very happy to see this game released on steam with new achievements, character boosters and more to keep the game going, but the main thing i do not like about it, is that the steam version has the horrible remixed midi music from the 1998 PC version and the DRM sucks so badly, other then that i heavily recommend this game, also i'm stuck playing it again non-stop LOL.UPDATE: Square relased an update that removed the horrible crappy midi music files and replaced them with the original PS1 music, now the game sounds much better and the battles and boss fights will be even more epic.

												The pinnacle of JRPGs for many players, this game has aged like wine in many regards and like milk in others.The graphics have aged poorly, and the early-PS1 blockiness and untextured polygons of the characters may turn off some people, though they are charming in their own way. The pre-rendered backgrounds still look decent, and battle models are much less blocky than their overworld counterparts.The story has aged very well, and provides a strong narrative with many emotional moments and memorable locales, and all of the main characters have strong character arcs and growth throughout the story, even if they are not in the forefront at times.The battle system is good, never feeling too frantic or too slow, and abilities and strides a nice line between turn-based and real-time. Difficulty is pretty well-tuned throughout the game, there were not many situations where it felt that grinding levels and equipment was necessary (Although if one wants to take on some of the post-game optional bosses, they will need to grind quite a bit).The soundtrack is immaculate, and almost every track in the game is memorable in their own way.

												A timeless classic RPG that has been loved by many people since the original release. I remember playing this game every few years never quite managing to fully complete it and now I begin again with the hope of an eventual completion that will make life worth living.The game runs fine apart from the occasional crashes though it only tends to happen when the game is minimized and this is easily avoidable. The steam achievements give an additional gameplay factor to help spurn on the dedicated player, though it would be nice to have a few more that are inventive and challenging rather than requiring a mass grind session (Of which we tend to do already) or perusing youtube/guide sites in order to find glitches and bugs to aid in the completion from almost twenty years of playing.I would recommend this game to all generations, as a long time fan of the final fantasy series (Waning in recent years due to the class of game they have released). I will rack up the hours gladly and not be disappointed that my life accomplishments end here.			"

												Do you really not know this game? Seriously, do I even have to write this? I want to note, that this was the first game I played when I upgraded from a Genesis to a PS1. I had never played an RPG before. This game introduced me to video games with true stories, even if the story is pure insanity. That said, instead of listing why it is awesome, I'm gonna tell you all the things that I know suck about it. Also note, I recommend it. I own it on PS1, PC hardcopy, and on Steam, so I want you to buy it.1. The graphics. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥are they awful. Like seriously, so blocky and distracting and if I didn't love it so much I wouldn't even be able to play it and get past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics.2. Summons are so ♥♥♥♥ing long! They are beautiful, yes, even with♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics, but they get real tiresome after the 75th Knights of the Round.3. As previously mentioned, the story makes zero sense. Yes, in broad strokes, there's supposed to be a pattern and such, but as you get to the details it is nonsensical. Yeah, the death scene was tragic and yeah I cried, ♥♥♥♥ you I was young and had no idea and had raised that character as one of my powerhouses, but despite that the rest is just crap. Also that death still seems to have no reason behind it.4. Angst. so much angst! So much sad drama angst. Am I who I think I am? Are any of us truly human? Just... let me hit things with my giant phallic sword.There's more, but I'll stop there. So yeah, buy the game. You'll still love it.The Nostalgia is strong in this one.			"

												Dear Gamers, welcome to...« FINAL FANTASY VII »A few weeks ago, after doing my first trial on Final Fantasy 7,I though this game was crap. I even did a « downvote » evaluation.Alright, I knew that I would try to game more and that I might like itand would change my evaluation (actually, I really did one but Itrolled a bit on it. oAo Kinda. Was more like frustrated xD)Basically, Final Fantasy VII is a wonderful game. You might get lost in the beginning and hate the game (total beginning), but keep playing.Trust me, you will thank me later.The story is amazing, the game is pretty long itself. They were many questsnext to it, even though the game is from 1997.Most of players, when they first played the game, got lost. They did not know what was going on in that kind of uggly Factory area.But the game will explain you what was up at this time, a bit later.The fighting gameplay is awesome and kind of original, for a old RPG game kind!The game has some glitches that makes the game unique.I really hope that, in the FF7 remake, they would put the ""duplicate item"" glitch system back.It's one of the main reason of why players love this game. xDAnd you know what !?After doing the game, SquareEnix offers you an awesome and beautiful movie named « Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children » which is the following of the Story.Wonderful movie look for a 2004~2007 movie made.The only one thing I regret about that movie is the Kid voice acting.Like in many movies but oh well! I'm getting out of the topic.Please, buy FF7, enjoy every minutes out of it. Even the most annoying minutes. There is so much to do.Story, fights, chasing materias, growing chocobos, playing in Gold-Saucer, improving your character, hunting Achievements.Unlike my first evaluation, I do recommend you this game.Peace! ♥			"

												Final Fantasy 7.Possibly the most Iconic Video Game that SquareSoft/Square Enix has ever made. And for good reason.Final Fantasy 7, although the graphics compared with today's games are completely rubbish, however back in 1997 these graphics were top of the line. The cutscenes amazed fans and enticed them.Final Fantasy 7 has a great, gripping storyline, Filled with humor, horror and of course sadness which anyone who knows anything about Final Fantasy surely heard of the tragedy that happened with one of the main characters. Not only does it have a great storyline but it has one of the most iconic and loved antagonists, ""Sephiroth"", much more then just a ""Mummies boy"" as many fans and haters stated, he has one of the best battle themes and of course best Limit Break, ""SuperNova"".Final Fantasy 7 has a excellent soundtrack composed mainly by Nobuo Uematsu but the PC Version was given, poor horrible MIDI formats. Luckily Square Enix upgraded them but it isn't the same as the original PSX version.Not only is the main quest great but it also has a brilliant side quests and entertainment. You can learn the history of the playable characters during Disc 2/Disc 3 and you can spend your hard earned Gill at the Gold Saucer, betting on Chocobo Races, Smashing SOLDIER off bikes or just slide down a snowy slope on a snowboard some idiot kid gave you.Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 8/10Music: 6/10Side Quests: 10/10Addictivity: 9/10Overall, great value for money. And is definitely one of or THE best RPG game ever made. No wonder fans all around the world still want a PS3 / PS4 Remake. I know I do!			"

												Normally I'm not into these type of old Turn Based JRPGS. I've tried Fire Emblem and Bravely Default, but they never really clicked with me. Now a friend paypaled me money to purchase the game and now that I have finished the game after 40ish hours, I can safely say I'm glad I got this game and it's probably the best b-day gift I have ever gotten. After playing FFXV and Crisis Core, I was pretty motivated to play this game. And based on what I've played in FFVII, I can see myself playing through the older Final Fantasy games for most of this year.The story has been and still is amazing and the simple yet satisfying gameplay is pretty nice. Idk why, but for this game, I feel a lot more motivated to grind in general regarding turn base JRPGs compared to before and the cast itself is likable with each one contributing an interesting personality. Even with the old visual styles, I found myself very immersed with the story because of how good it is and the characters that help bring it to life. I can't believe this game was released the same year I was born, so I never had the chance to play this game at all. The Soundtrack, obviously it's amazing whether you're fighting or roaming around the land. Very memorable and during certain scenes, very appropriate as well.The DRM regarding the square enix account, idk if that has been a huge issue prior, but I was watching my friend stream it and he had no issues with it and I haven't had any issues either. Ignore the negative reviews that mention the DRM cuz that doesn't hold it back. Sure you may need an internet connection, but honestly we're in an age where we need an internet connection.Overall, I honestly couldn't really find any flaws with the game that are very notable that could ruin the experience. I am aware that there are some glitches that can ruin the game, but thankfully I haven't ran into any of them. Outside of them, the game is perfect and definitely one of the best video games I have played of all time. I'm really glad I got to start on this game now because I almost avoided the game just to wait for the remake, which is still a few years away from being released. Now here I am just satisfied with FFVII and now even more excited for the remake to come out as well as having a huge urge to play through as many old Final Fantasy Games as I can. And I'm still not even done with FFVII because of a lot of post game content I definitely plan on doing, which will take up a lot of my time still. If you want to play an old game to get yourself into the FF series, definitely start with VII. You can't go wrong with this.Oh and as to note this game is just a little over $10 right now and I don't see why they would raise the price on this game, so for just that price, you get at least 40ish hours of immersive gameplay, and it's amazing how much an old game can really give you an amazing experience.

												It's Final Fantasy VII, except on PC, and with the no so hot Midi music! Despite that, I had a blast reliving the classic dream. And since I blew through two Disc 1 versions of this one gaaammee..... Having it somewhere stable is a relief. Also, did I mention it's ♥♥♥♥ing Final Yuffie Fantasy VII?			"

												Ok. So I just recently reinstalled this on my PC. HOWEVER. I have been playing it on my PS4, and JESUS CHRIST. This game is good. Playing as an ex-mercenary for a vigilante squad called AVALANCHE. Sounds cheesy, but it's really not. The plot thickens randomly at some points in this game, and a few plot twists make this game a masterpiece. Easy 10/10 for me. My favorite game of all time.			"

												Let us be straight forward: The game is beautiful. I've played it when I was 16 and I loved my experience. Nowadays I can see things that passed and I didn't realized they were there. Story is deep and heavy. Gameplay is solid. What can I say? One of the best games of all time. It is SUPER WORTHY buying.			"

												A popular opinion among many, but FF7 is my favorite game of all time. Not just because of nostalgia, but because it is an incredible experience. While it has not aged well graphically, the story, soundtrack, and characters still stand tall. Fighting the Ruby and Emerald Weapons still has me mashing the O button hoping I don't get obliterated. The final fight between Cloud and Sephiroth still pumps me up as Cloud shreds him apart with Omnislash. The loss of arguably the most beloved character of all time still brings a tear to my eye. Hell, I will still attempt to bring Aerith back, knowing in the back of my head it's not possible, or I will try to get that mysterious chocobo the runs underwater or even outerspace knowing no such thing exists. Call me biased if you will but this game is a must play! Infinity/100 greatest game ever! "

												Though I have not beaten the game on pc, I have beaten it and played it to its fullest hundreds of times on its original platform and to say the least: A complete Masterpiece. No other RPG you will ever play compares to this game. It was the first of its kind, when it came to visuals, story, and complexity. The materia and stat systems are created very well, and the game has around 50 hours of gameplay. This may not be a big deal today for an RPG but in 1997, the reaction to that was: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I cannot talk about the true nirvana that this game is and do it justice, so just please. Play it. It holds the top spot of my favorite video games of all time list, and most of all, has the top spot in my heart.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is the first game I played on the original PSX back in 97. I was 10 at the time and the most advanced game I'd played until that point was Sonic ;) FFVII opened up an entire new world for me, showing what video games can and should be. With a story better than any film, that is both tragic and at times wonderfully frivolous and off the wall, the emotional dynamism of this game makes it an all time classic. It changed my life in more than one way - Nobuo Uematsu's timeless score, with it's clever variations on the main theme, was my inspiration to follow a career in music.I've finished the game at least 20 times in almost as many years, and every time I look at the game in a different way. It is as relevant emotionally and politically now as it ever was. If you've never played it before, it's not too late. And if you have, then seeing it spruced up is a great experience. Could Squeenix have tried harder to make this a more unique experience? Absolutely. Is the DRM a nuisance? Some say it is - I haven't had a problem yet but I do fundamentally have a problem with the idea of DRM. So Squeenix definitely lose points for that. But it is great enough as it stands to be worth it anyway.			"

												I played this game originally on the PSX in 1997 when i was 13, since then the game has aged ok.the background renders are still beautiful but the 3d sprites are a bit rubbish.The battle scenes, magic effects anf FMV though still have that quaint feel that feels nice even now.i sunk hundreds, if not thousands of hours into this game and i have completed it start to finish at least 10 times, gotten every secret and probed every nook and cranny.I love this game though i admit that its partailly through rose tinted glassesIf you have never played it before and you are interested in JRPGs or the final fantasy series in general i suggest you pick it up. if you are into your CoD and Halo and were born after the PS2 era, id give it a miss because im not sure that you will like it.However for me as its the game that introduced me to serious storytelling in gaming, im going to give this 10/10, would omnislash Sephiroth again			"

												FF7 is a game of split opinions. If you have never played it or any newer FF, you will love it. Lots to explore, fun side quests, some rather amusing scenarios you'll chuckle at, and a dark story to follow. The battle system is dated but very easy to learn but can be made interesting through 'sneaky' materia(magic) combinations. It is a fantasy world and sometimes things just seem to defy logic, just remember its japanese game things will be strange.If you have played this game, then purchasing this version has nothing new for you unless you're N/A region. and even then its 2 optional bosses. everything else is the same. just looks nicer. doesn't play faster isn't harder, and some of the dialog appears changed.

												I never got the chance to play this originally on Playstation. It was always one of those games that I wanted to play, but could never find a copy of, so I was ecstatic when I found out that the PC port was available through Steam. One Steam sale and 36 hours later, I now finally understand both the hype and the hatred towards this game. Personally, I really enjoyed it and consider myself a part of the hype category. A colorful cast of characters that are well-designed and well-developed, a combat system intertwined with the Materia spell system for unique encounters and boss battles, and an amazing plot that kept me invested all the way through. Few JRPGs have held me for as long as this one has, rivaled only by the Kingdom Hearts franchise. There may be other entries in the Final Fantasy series that can be argued for over VII, but I can understand and respect why this game is held on such a prestigious pedestal.			"

												For a great many people Final Fantasy VII may as well have been Final Fantasy I. This was the game that introduced me to the genre of JRPGs, with its classic spiky haired protagonists and oversized weaponry. More importantly, it also demonstrated, to a worldwide audience, the potential scale and spectacle that modern video games now provide almost effortlessly. At the time, this was something special.Returning to the game now might intially highlight some out of date looks and casts a stark light on plotting that perhaps passes less muster to a more discerning, mature player. However, I think too much is made of these critisisms; the game, while aged (as happens to all of us) still has a charm to it's blocky low-poly models that elevate it above most games of that period (even ones that were arguably better looking at the time), and the high production values, cinematic camera shots, and incredible music score help promote a timeless quality that help retain playability. And the story, while suffering from a sometimes dodgy translation, touches upon big themes of identity, loss and the environmental cost of progress, while remaining accessible in a children's action/soap opera vibe. The story beats swing between comedy and seriousness a little unevenly (sometimes a more than a little, actually), but not unsuccessfully, and overall the plot is driven by appealling character relationships, and great action set pieces cut between quieter, more reflective moments.The game is huge, opening out from an inital starting city into a whole world to explore, filled with lots of optional things to do which will keep you busy way past the more linear main story path. The combat system is interesting, featuring an active time battle system which merges turn based strategy with some time pressure. The magic system is fun, collecting materia, which acts as spells which attach to your weapons and armor, and level independently of your characters, providing flexibility. The game finds lots of ways to play with the systems it establishes.The PC version has some weaknesses in that the backgrounds don't always merge as seemlessly with the video transitions and 3D foreground elements as well as on the original console versions, and the music suffers a bit too. Also, if you play with keyboard controls, some of mini-games have occasionally overly dexterous key mappings which might turn your delicate hands into twisted pretzels.Despite the flaws above, if you haven't played Final Fantasy VII, the PC version remains a solid way to experience a true classic of gaming.

PC Port ReviewThis is a re-release of the original PC port from 1998.GameplayNothing has really been changed here, glitches and exploits included. It's plays exactly like the PlayStation version only with slightly better visuals and faster loading times. The only major difference in gameplay is how control prompts/instructions are displayed in-game.Controls- Xbox 360 controller is supported.  - Cannot use dpad or triggers (bumpers work, but not triggers.)   - Original game did not have rumble support, nor does this.  - Very playable.- Keyboard support only.    - No mouse.    - Majority of keys are rebindable.   - Very playable.GraphicsPros: - Can be played in a higher res compared to PlayStation version.- Models do not look as jagged and blurry compared to PlayStation.- FMVs (while compressed) have aged pretty well.Cons:- Game battles are locked in at 30FPS, menus included making Tifa or Cait Sith's limit breaks a bit harder to use.- Framerate is not consistent across world map and has major pop in of objects.- Pre-rendered backgrounds while upscaled are very pixelated.- Would recommend playing on a TV or a Window for those that do not like pixels.Graphics note: While the game has a ""widescreen option"" I would highly recommend playing the game in its original 4:3 aspect ratio with your regular screen resolution, playing this game in widescreen will only stretch the image and make it look worse.SoundWith a patch from Sqaure-Enix the game has all of it's original PlayStation music tracks, I have noticed some sounds are missing however. Not a major distraction.Would I recommend this?Yes! I played through the game through it's full story and some side quests and had no major problems or technical issues. It's not a perfect port but I support the Final Fantasy series being ported to PC and hope to see more in the future.			"

												FFVII is an absolute smasher of a game.  Part of that for me is nostalgia but the other part is that when you get down to it this is probably the series at its best.  The magic system is flexible, summons are not broken, the characters are more interesting than in other installments...they just really nailed it.  I remember getting this game for Christmas when I was in my early teens and spending most of my winter break absolutely glued to it.  Having played through it a bunch of times over the last 20 years I must concede that it's one which I feel like ""I wanna play that game again!"" and then find myself saving at the same spot and not picking it up again for a long time because I feel like the beginning of the game drags a lot (pun referencing an early plot point not intentional).However, when the timing is right and I can get into actually going beyond Midgar I get sucked in big time.  Without exaggerating at all I will confess that within the past few years I have completed the game three times and in each of those playthroughs I would sit and play the game for a week straight, putting more hours into it than my full time job.  This game is that good, and it is seriously worth your time if you like RPGs.  There's damn good reason that this is a legendary chapter in the genre with its name spoken with the same reverence of titles like Lunar.			"

												I was one of those people who actively hated Final Fantasy 7 back in the day thinking that it was just all unnecessary hype (I'm more of an FF6 kind of guy). Having played it now, though, I can see the source of praise. This is a great FF to start with, but it has some problems that make it feel rather dated even more so than the GBA ports of the first handful of games.The story is great and the characters are all well-rounded and interesting and you actually feel for them. Kind of hard to do seeing as the dialog is very dated in terms of translation, but they're just that well-written, I think. And I think that's it's primary selling point -- the story. It's a fun time capsule for what it's worth and it stands up to the going version of FF6 at the time in terms of character and story and it might even be a bit better in some respects given that it has fewer characters, meaning more time to bond with each of them instead of having only one feature per character to go through an arc with like it's done in FF6.That said, I think that the controls and balancing are VERY dated. Command inputs are rather clunky when compared to other FF of the era (glad they fixed this with FF9). Accidentally targeting your ally with an offensive spell just because they walked up to an enemy or healing an enemy because they walked up to an ally is annoying and I wish that Sqaure hadn't experimented with the targeting system the way they did. The menu overlay in-battle as well as navigating through the Materia menu may take a bit of getting used to especially if you forget there's a [SWITCH] command on the button layout.Graphics, while great for their time, are rather dated seeing them in HD. The HD character polygons don't blend as well against pre-rendered low resolution backgrounds and it breaks the immersion a bit and makes things look more dated than they should. I think I'll give the graphics settings a few more tries to get it to emulate the old CRT-TV graphics on the PS1 as close as possible.			"

												I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan despite the fact that I never got around to playing FF7 in its glory days. I can now testify after finally beating it that the game deserves much of the praise it has received.HOWEVER, if you didn't grow up with Final Fantasy or ""old school"" JRPGs, you might find this game a little tough to get into due to the conveniences we are now offered in modern games.There are random battles which can't be avoided without the use of third party software. I still highly recommend it, but perhaps consider using a guide if you just want to play it for the story, as it doesn't always hold your hand.I still think FF9 is superior and makes for a better entry point to the Final Fantasy series. I think FF7 gets a bit too much credit. That being said, it is still a fantastic game--one that every RPG fan ought to play.8.9/10 "

												I loved this game when it first came out, and having bought it on Steam, I thought it was safe to throw away my original CDs (of which I had 2 sets) so as not to fiddle with DOSBOX.I should have never done that.  Before even getting this ""port"" to run, there's all kinds of signing up and account creation happening, and that sort of idiocy sticks in my craw.  I remember when you could just buy a game, take it home, and play it, without having to allow it to target market to you.In short ... no, don't buy this.  Stick to your old disks.  Wrestle with them to get them working under whatever version of Windows to which you are enslaved today.  It'll  be better than having to deal with the Steam version.			"

												It's one of the greatest games of all time.  What more needs to be said?Well, unfortunately it's probably the worst version available.  The resolution is atrocious, the music is low quality, and the blocky characters have not aged well at all.  Solution?  Modding!...which leads to a host of other problems.  The game looks absolutely beautiful, music sounds great, better battle interface, and holy crap the character models are fantastic.  It's just...mods don't work on steam.  I've been playing the game off of steam in order to enjoy the game, and then load up the unmodded steam version at specific points to catch achievements.  Not to mention it'll crash every now and then.Final verdict?  Unmodded steam version: 6/10.  Still a great game just presented horribly.Modded nonsteam version: 9/10.  Unavoidable crashing and no official support keep it from a 10.I wonder how many people will call me a cheater for 100%ing the game in under 10 hours.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is an amazing game and I feel should be played by any gamer in his/her life. But please, oh please do not get the Steam release of FF7. Not only is it a bit of a shoddy port from what I've seen, but the game requires that you sign up for a Square Enix account and run what is effectivly a sencond layer of DRM on your computer in order to have some fairly pointless online features that nobody asked for. I unfortunetly was not aware of this when I went to buy it but I feel that anyone here should be aware of this before they make a purchase. If you have no problems with this, then buy it by all means. I however cannot and will not support any game that pulls this crap. "

												I've been playing games since I was 5 years old. 15 Years of gaming and this game came out when I was only a year old. I didn't find out about/play FFVII until I was 15 but when I did, it immediately became my favorite game period. I've completed the story around 6-7 times (lost track) over the last 5 years. I'll probably play it another 5 before I get a bit bored XD. Needless to say, I think this is an amazing game. FFX used to be my favorite and is still in my top 3, but this one definitely takes the cake!			"

												Final Fantasy VII, the RPG that revolutionized all RPGs, has never succeeded in disappointing me, and it still hasn't. Just a few minor changes were made, but it's nothing game-changing. Just like the original, and worth replaying for the achievements. If you're a hardcore Final Fantasy fan like I am, then you absolutely MUST get this game; getting the achievements proves to your friends how dedicated you are. :)			"

												Its an alltime classic. Definitely in my top 3 best game of all time. With no exaggeration, I've finished this game ten times including beating all of the weapons, mastering all of the materia, collecting all items, Chocobo's, limit breaks and started it many more times again. I've lost tens of thousands of hours to this game over the last 18yrs and was my true first gaming love, the game that made me love playing video games.If some how you have not had a chance to play this, it is a must - forget about the ""poor"" graphics as just one hour in you will see past the two decade old graphics and settle in for one of the best gaming experiences you can have.

												It's exactly the same as the old PS Final Fantasy 7. It is not HD, so you will see 2 blocks of black striped on the left and right end of your screen. Graphics is still very blocky, nothing changed here. The music is not bad, although haters gonna hate, I still love it despite the difference with the PS version.The gameplay, needless to say, was awesome and epic! However since the graphic is so old, no enhancement whatsoever, I guess only FF fans will like it.I am FF fan. So I love it.Best played with a joystick.My score: 9/10			"

												What is there to say? This is without a doubt my favorite game of all time!It is acclaimed as one of the best RPGs of all time and even as the best of its franchise, it has a grand story coupled with memorable characters and an epic soundtrack to boot.While I can't recommend it enough to everyone that still hasn't played it yet, I suppose that despite all the praise one could give, it still might not be a game for everyone. This is a Turn-Based J-RPG with an Active Time Battle system, and so if you're really not into this genre maybe this isn't the game for you.One of the best qualities of Final Fantasy VII that any of its fans can tell you is its incredible score, what a masterpiece! Nobuo Uematsu - long time Final Fantasy series composer - outdid himself with this soundtrack. It ranges from catchy and happy to sad and sombre pieces, from highly atmospheric to fast paced adrenaline-pumping tunes, from very simple to more complex melodies, it also covers a great amount of musical styles: classical, rock, industrial, techno, reggae, bossa nova... and the list goes on.As for the graphics, this version improves on some things: FMVs have been upscaled to be of better quality when compared to the original PlayStation FMVs, this time around Shaders were added to increase the quality and looks of models and thus eliminating the jagged lines that plagued the PS1 version, and now it also allows the use of resolutions up to 1080p by upscaling the game.Even with these modest improvements, for some the game hasn't aged all that well. And I can agree that to a degree the 2D backgrounds can look very pixelated at times, this setback is more apparent because of the higher resolution the game uses, coupled with the fact that the backgrounds were never redone for this newer version, from what I heard this was because the original 2D Pre-Rendered Background assets were somehow ""lost"" from Square-Enix archives (or maybe they never even bothered to retain the originals, who knows?) and so, to make higher resolution ones they would have to remake every single one of them from scratch.By releasing on Steam it also came with the now mandatory Achievements, I know some people that really look forward to those.And lastly, I would also like to point out that for those who are computer savvy enough and are willing to put in the extra effort, the exclusive possibility for the PC to Mod this game with all sorts of textures/models/sounds etc. is indeed a big plus for many.In conclusion, Final Fantasy VII is without a doubt one of the best experiences out there to be had, and this PS1 era Classic looks now better than it ever did thanks to it's 2012 version PC re-release.I sincerely hope you'll love it as much as I do.

												If you are looking for a great story line with great gameplay and don't mind outdated graphics this is a game you should try.Together with FF9, fallout 1&2 this game makes up the top of my list of best games ever made. Literally spend hundreds if not thousands of hours playing this back on the PS1 and on emulators before it came to steam and all I can say is that despite the somewhat ""slower"" gamespeed I still enjoy the game like I did when I first played it.

												After the many years of this game being out and playable in various platforms I have finally taken the time and played this game for the first time.I see a lot of the praise this game gets for the Final Fantasy franchise for the creative and beautiful graphical achievements it did back in the day when the game was first released. It also had quite a deal of depth in the nature of option side-questing things that would give you good rewards for the effort (even though there were some I had not even tried/found.) The musical score definitely had some wonderful pieces in there that definitely set the mood and the feels with the story. Speaking of story this is where I believe it faltered a little. There were some parts that I felt were not needed or were not explained thoroughly for what it was showing. Some parts felt even patched in just to add more to the story and extend the gameplay. If it kept to the main theme of what the game hummed all along the story would have been solid.In the end though: I'd still give it a few more playthroughs just to see all the bits that I had missed for a first playthrough and try different team combos.

												Widely considered to be a true innovation of the series, this game tops the list of a lot of FF players - for good reason. Whilst not my own personal favourite, there is a lot here to love.Although looking a little jaded by today's ""modern"" standards, back in the day the graphics were thought of as a technological breakthrough; VII is the first true 3D game of the FFs. It may be a little blocky now, but if you really take issue with that then there are plenty of nice-looking mods for the PC version.At its heart, FFVII is an underdog story, telling the tale of a ragtag resistance facing a corrupt organisation (and later on, something even worse - a threat to the entire planet, coming from a villain who is without a doubt the most recogniseable of the series.) The characters are (mostly...I'm ignoring the existence of Cait Sith for the purpose of this review) a likeable bunch, with mixed backstories and rather good development. Cloud comes off as a little dull and bland to begin with, but he comes into his own later on. Occasionally the plot may take a little turn for the confusing and wacky, but it's largely resolved to a clean degree (anything that isn't is explained more in-depth through the spin offs.) The villains are very entertaining, and in some cases you really end up hating them - which is the point, naturally.The Materia system is a nice touch - any character can equip any skill, and the more you battle the more powerful these skills become, and the more often you can use them. There is a real sense of progression and accomplishment.Of course, as expected by now, the music is another accomplishment. This game probably has my favourite ""standard"" boss battle theme of the lot, except from maybe that of VI. The town themes largely have their own feel (an East Asian theme for Wutai, a tribal one for Cosmo Canyon, etc.) Also, ""One-Winged Angel."" Those of you who have played this before know that I need say nothing else.This is the ""entry game"" for a lot of players, and it does give a very nice feel of what to expect from the other games. It wasn't afraid to take risks with both technological boundaries and storytelling, and should be admired for that reason alone. As I mentioned - not my favourite, but no less of a gaming classic.

												Some people may find FINAL FANTASY series such a boring games,but for me myself... i found this as a masterpiece.FINAL FANTASY series is the best RPG games of all timesIt's the games of my childhood, and I really have a big time fun enjoy playing the FINAL FANTASY series, not only VII.It's a 100/100 Metascore RPG game for me.FINAL FANTASY VII :Good GameplayGood Game MechanicsInteresting StoryExcellent MusicFun Mini GamesInteresting Quest		Some Secret QuestSome HumorsThe bad thing : the graphic is screw !! (compared to modern games today)Yes ofcourse, coz it's a 1997 old classic game, was designed for PlayStationand later on was released for Windows 95 / Windows ME.And the graphic doesn't support widescreen.Yes there is mod to fix this : Tifa Bootleg.Ok about this FF VII Steam version :----------------------------------------FINAL FANTASY VII Steam Edition is just a new repack from an old classic 1997 Squaresoft game.The Difference between the orginal and the Steam version is :FF VII now become compatible with Windows 7Worse audio file (dunno about today, but i heard SE later on just release the patch for this issue)Need 1 new account at Square Enix. Well now customer got 1 more ID & Password to be remembered for a single player game (HEY THIS IS BAD !! It's FF VII single player offline not FF XIV)New features : Achievement & Online Save & Character Booster(Character Booster is the worst aspect of the game, it makes the game become not fun anymore, because our character now come with max hp and max gil..... You know what ? Our hero become too strong and the enemy become too weak now !!) Why don't SE replace the bonus with something make sense which not make our character become overpower ? such as : + 10 materia of medium level + some medicine (20 potion 20 elixir 20 ether) etc etc whatever.... instead of max hp and max gil :(And i'm a bit dissappointed about the graphic option. Don't get me wrong... i know it's a classic game, so i don't expect any high texture like modern - Geforce GTX 770 VGA - games today. What I mean is : If the game doesn't support widescreen, why do SE bother to give the widescreen resolution option ??? :D So if u are a fan of high end graphic games -------> Don't buy thisIf u already has FF VII and expect something new different in FF VII Steam Edition -------> Don't buy thisWell i just wonder, why SE don't remake this ? A full HD Remastered of an old classic best selling RPG game FF VII instead of just repackage it to be compatible with Windows 7 ?? :DD lolzOk let's check the FF VII forum......I heard that they (the community of FF VII) has make a mod for FF VII (graphic texture, music, menu, etc...etc) much better than the company itself :D lolz hahahaShame on u LAZY SE :D   Many customers angry, and we maybe reconsider to buy the repacakage of FINAL FANTASY IX in the future. Why ??? Because u lazy !!! u lazy !! and liar !!  U don't make any worth improvement, u just repackage it and add new but not so worth features, and sell it with lies !! That's why many customers regret to buy FINAL FANTASY VIII (Yes FF 8) (repackage product of SE), even the old original 1998 PS version of FF VIII game has better music quality than the new repackage FF VIII of 2013 !! And some of them are vowed not to buy any future products of lazy liar developer, unless bla bla...... (well u know what i'm about to say)I've been thinking of purchasing FINAL FANTASY VIII on Steam, but since that SE has broke this originally fantastic FF VIII (Graphic & Audio) to a disgrace level - a piece of crap, now i'm holding back !  I won't buy FINAL FANTASY VIII in this state for $ 11.99   :|Will that SE release some patch for this game ??Well let's see the future products of SE :|************Update FF VII************Recently i'm attaching Tifa Bootleg Mod to this FF VIIIt's works like a charm... a pretty cool improvement in graphic and sound.But yea ofcouse It's not a full 100% HD Remake in all aspect of the game.Tifa Bootleg Mod let u to costumize character model, graphic texture, sound, weapon, menu style, icons , better trainer, and more...Tifa Bootleg mod can upgrade ur FF VII music & also FMV cut scenes to a better quality ones.Tifa Bootleg can also make this game graphic strecth to widescreen resolution, butu will notice that's something wrong there, cause the game wasn't designed for,and never been remake to support widescreen display.The mod is the only way to play FINAL FANTASY VII HD Remake version :)Coz that lazy hand Square Enix will never do it, except the FF community.Nah... nah.... SE will never remake FF VII, too much effort for it, that's what they thought.Thanks to the community for this work.U can launch FF VII from Steam. but with limitation of the mod's resource.To use all of the resource from the mod, u need to launch FF VII from Tifa's Launcher,but by doing this : losing achievements and save games.Yes not a perfect mod though, but for me this one is good enough.The installation is quite easy, but yea the pain is u need to download around 16 GB :DThanks to FF Community !!

												This is my favorite Final Fantasy and my favorite JRPG after Chrono Trigger. The soundtrack is probably one of the best soundtracks you will ever hear in a video game. The story is pretty predictible but I love the characters in this game and found them to be very memorable. I will have to say though that this game's graphics hasen't really aged well and I found the gameplay to be too easy and probably the easiest final fantasy out there cuz in all honesty a blind monkey could beat this game. But final verdict is that if you never played this yet and looking for a game with good music, characters, story and of course gameplay then you should definitely pick this up.PS: Aerith scene made me cry like a ♥♥♥♥♥ ;~; "

												FF& is one of my all time favourites. Unfortunatly this forces you to unlock your game by logging in with a Facebook account OR creating a sqaure Enix log in (which kept giving web page errors on the final step of signin). Not having a FB account made this difficult and it was actually less hassle/buggy to create an FB account to sign in with to play my game. Kind of a inconvenient extra layer of DRM validation when Steam should already be good enough.Game itself is good,,,			"

												I'm glad to see this game come to PC, since I don't own any consoles and I've heard my friends say for years how great of a game it was.  As a result, when it became available for a remarkably good price of four USD I picked it up.That said, they could have done a much better job on porting this game.  By the numbers:1.  The controls are permanently set, and if you don't own a gamepad you're permanently saddled with the most non-intuitive control scheme I've ever seen, where the binds make little to no sense and are scattered all over the keyboard.2.  The client is inherently unstable, to a point where I suffered from 4(!) crashes by the time I had finished the first battle.  I'm talking complete crash to desktop restarts here.  3.  In addition to this glaring problem, the client hangs severely even when next to no load is being placed on the system.  The first fight, as mentioned earlier, while not overly complicated and only requiring a total of 4 attacks including the ones against the player character took me over five minutes to complete.  Now I know that I don't have the best computer in the world, especially when I'm playing on my laptop like I am, but this system has no difficulty handling modern games.  It should be taking FFVII and bending it over the table, but instead it hangs... especially in the CGI sequences where I had to use CTRL+ALT+DEL to force close the client a few times because the video had picked a spot and froze while the TERRIBLE 8 bit sounding music was on a 2 second loop that would make the most patient man in the world go insane.To sum up, while I was very interested in playing this game, and I am sure that if it is patched to a playable state it will be excellent and enjoyable, I simply cannot recommend it to anyone in its current condition.  Ya let me down Square Enix.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is one of those games that to me, personally, will never get old.I thoroughly enjoy it even though the graphics are horrendously outdated, because when you start to play it, none of that matters.  It is slow to start off with, but once you can get into the open world, it opens up the story line and becomes one of the best games in the Final Fantasy franchise.			"

This is my first negative review of a game on Steam and I've had an account for 5 years. I ran into several errors just trying to run this game, sign in and make an account. After I finally got logged in, I had it crash. I tried to save after a gaming session only to find my save could not work. Overall not impressed with the port of this game.

												Requires you to sign up for a Square Enix account before it allows you to play, then links that account to your Steam account. You cannot set your control keys in game, meaning you either have to play with backwards controls (right hand directional left hand activate and cancel, etc) or install yet another program to alter your computer's keystroke recognition.

												Final Fantasy VII is basically the first game that I ever pre-ordered in my life when purchasing a game. This was when I was just a little kid, and was quite excited about the Japanese release of Final Fantasy VII. It took me months to beat this game on first try, and about 8 years ago, I bought myself an English version of it and beat it in 1 week. I still remember myself doing the final battle over and over, as it was very entertaining back then. And now Final Fantasy VII has got some HD treatment (Not sure I can call it a full HD....as it appears only the character models look decent and the background looks quite distorted still as the original. Meh, prob not a HD. Doesn't matter though) and what can I say. This game just never gets old. As I bought the Japanese version of FFVII on day one, I just had to buy this one on day one as well, as a hardcore, long time Final Fantasy fan.Music is just outstandingly epic. Even to this very day, I still listen to ""You Can Hear the Cry of the Planet"" 


YouTube™ Video: Final Fantasy VII - You Can Hear the Cry of the Planet [HQ] 

			Views: 421,005		

			Final Fantasy 7 - You Can Hear the Cry of the Planet [HQ]		

Which is possibly one of the most powerful music ever composed by mankind. Gameplay. Well, what can I say. I beat this game twice, in both Japanese and English versions, played the final boss battle for over 50 hours. This game, is almost like a standard of RPG. Am I exaggerating somehow? Not even. Story. Well? I have never encountered an RPG that has a better story than this game. It is purely filled with the best elements that the best games normally possess. The only other thing that I can say about this game is that this is truly the best game ever made.No wait, it is actually more than just a ""best game"". This is, a Mona Lisa of all RPGs.10 out of 10 = Masterpiece			"

												So after reading a lot of reviews about all the trouble people have had with this game and with square I checked out all the positive reviews and figured it was worth a buy on sale. This game brings me back to my high school days and I have beaten it many times. I still have the original for my PS but the first disk is damaged and wont let me play in Midgar.Anyway, I have had zero issues with setting up my square account and it only takes one log in to play so that hasn't been an issue for me at all. I said ""no thank you"" to having cloud saves available and I will never use the character boost, to me it is a pretty dumb addition to the game.The cleaned up graphics took some getting used to and the controls on the keyboard are a little funky for sure so if you can set up a controller I would recomend it. That being said the characters now do look nice without funky angles shooting out of thier bodies. Music sounds great I am guessing it has been fixed since so many complained about it. If you loved this game when you were younger or want to play it now because you never have and it is on sale, go for it! Still an amazing game and I love that I can play it for what seems like the 100th time and still love every second.			"

												This is hands down one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series. It has a great cast with an unforgettable story. Also the combat is a lot of fun. The graphics are starting to show their age but that doesn't mean anything, infact it adds to the nostalgia. Maybe one day square will do us good with a real HD remake of this game, but in the meantime for the price on steam you can't beat it!			"

												When I payed £40 for it almost 20 years ago it was worth every penny, at the current sale price of around £4, it would be a crime not to. Possibly the best story ever in any game and plays much better than the sorry efforts that are FF12 onwards, and the dated graphics just don't matter at all.			"

												This is one masterpiece of RPG right here. It has great story, characters, music, and it's fun to make your own decisions to see how everything turns out. Unlike other RPGs this one has pretty fast paced battles, and implements mechanics that other RPGs don't, making this game unique. The default PC controls can be a little difficult to get used to, but are easy to use in most circumstances and you can change them any way you like. One feature I like is the Limit Break feature, because getting the crap beat out of you then taking your revenge with a Braver or Cross Slash Limit Break can be very satisfiying. I can't wait to get farther in the game, and I would personally recommend this game to any fan of RPGs or Final Fantasy. My Score: 9.7			"

												This game is a great opportunity for people to witness a great game with a unique story. The thing with Square Enix games is: that one can decide for one self how to follow the story and complete it. The thing is; even if you complete the side quests along the way; you will always be guided towards the main-story. This makes the player feel they can decide for themselves what they would prefer doing most in the game. With the graphics smoothed and optimized for modern PCs, anyone can take part in what this game has to offer.I will strongly recommend this game to be part of your gaming history.			"

												There are a few things that are different from the playstation version....Not plot, just some mechanics....things like quadratic doesn't seem to work on summons anymore....a coulple of old glitches are cleared up (like the throw item duplication thing, etc...) and getting used to a keyboard personally did not work for me so I reprogrammed the controls for a real playstation controller.The directional buttons don't work, so I hope you like analog sticks if you go this route. The direction that you move feels a little tweaked from the way I remember using the analog, so you need to get used to that a little bit....But overall-still the great game I remember from the PS1 without having to stop to change discs.   :)Either you've played it before and know its a great game and that I can't possibly sum it up in a review, or you don't and will have to decide whether or not to trust the experienced players.

												Underneath the crusty PC port is the game I love, shining like a jewel. But, with cloudsaving that, more often that not, doesn't work, an immensely rocky entry because of an account requirement for a single-player  game that should not have been a concern even months after launch on Steam, and multiple progress stealing crashes, FF7 for PC is not a game I can recommend, even as a diehard fan. It is just too much hassle, both in and out of the game.Update: Not really as upset with the game, but I still don't recommend the game, even to my friends. People who love Final Fantasy will play this regardless, just as I have. I don't encounter nearly as many crashes as I used to because I play it on a stronger computer, but have still encountered some. Cloudsaving is still a consistent problem, however. Though it works more than it doesn't, the times it doesn't are frustrating and can go on for as long as an entire day. The irony in this is that the player requires an account or linking of Facebook info, in part, because of this feature. To force a player to go to such lengths just to play a game that never required this in the first place for a feature that works so infrequently is not a good justification. This is not even mentioning that Steam has these functions covered, should the effort be put in. In text, it seems like a poor port.			"

This game is probably one of the greatest games I have ever played, despite it's low graphics the game feels so well down and sucks you in deep in the game, it's sound track is quite amazing as well, and there is even mod support for the game, people changing the graphics to look so much better, and gameplay changes of course. You'll play this game through multiple playthroughs just to feel it's fantastic story again, this is one of those games where you wish you can clear your mind whenever you do another playthrough, that's how fantastic the game is!

Would like to recommend the game, but it is broken in the most fundamental way possible: it erases all your data.This is probably related to the stupid (and largely non-functional) cloud save functionality.

												I didn't play video games as a child so I missed out on a lot of classics. Had a bit of trouble with the version on the PSN, tried using an emulator on my laptop but it kept giving me audio trouble and I just felt frustrated and bored.I bought this  version because I wanted to play the rest of the story myself and the remake announcement reminded me how much I love Aerith. I replayed all my progress from the past few months in a few days.The PC version is great, really easy to play with a gamepad. I didn't miss save states or any of the extras from the emulated version. It really sucked me into the story for the first time. Initially I was frustrated with the pre-rendered backgrounds but they grew on me. Very beautiful. It's really easy to get pulled into this universe.Gripes:I'm annoyed you have to make a square enix account to play the game. The site goes down all the time. The cloud saving rarely works and I reccomend turning it off if you are going to be saving a lot (like grinding on the world map etc). Also I didn't use the character boost because I didn't need it. I may try it on another playthrough though.			"

												Ok, I was really doubting this game. I thought it wasn't going to be as all the fanboys says it would be. ""OH MAH GAWD THIS IS BEST GAME EBER"" basically that. So I played alittle and I'm like, it's alright. But let's say a year later, a really good youtube channel (The Completionists') were doing a special on FF7. Since I saw that, I'm like, ""Hey! Why not finish this game so I don't get any spoilers from the video!"" It jurastically changed from that. I couldn't stop playing. It's like it was sucking me into this game. Although if it weren't for the PS1 music patch for this game, I wouldn't be here and playing this version, because I would be playing on the PS1 (but if I would have, it would take years because I never get on my PS1 on a daily basis). The graphics are a step up, and if you see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs this one, you only see that the character models are more high-def, and the pre-rendered graphics are displayed in a better resolution. Other than that, there is no difference gameplay-wise, except for the SUPER-OP character booster. What it does is that it makes any 3 of your characters in your party right now have 9999 hp and 999 mp (I'm not sure on the gil, it wasn't 99,999 but it was like 60,000 or something like that) other than that, it doesn't give you status buffs, nothing else. Just that (preety weird if you ask me, but you know, Square Enix will make anything worse *Puts on sunglasses*). It will also feel weird the first times using the keyboard, and I have found some mini-games unplayable when using my layout (A is OK, B is CANCEL, D is MENU, Space for START, Shift for SWITCH, Page Up and Down for left and right bumpers 'PS1 controller') and it is real nice that you can use an XBOX 360 controller even though I don't have one, I just use my PS3 controller and have some software to emulate the 360 (I'm not going in-depth about that). You can also use a PS2 controller, but you need an adapter (the best way to play if you ask me, but again, I don't have an adapter). In conclusion, it is the best Final Fantasy I've ever played, but not the best game I ever played.			"

With achievements! Saying this game is my favorite one is an understatement. It is my ABSOLUTE favorite. Can't wait for the HD remake. Well worth playing one of the best games from the 90s. Please get this game. You won't regret it. "

												This game straight up doesn't work. You open the launcher and get a 502 Bad Gateway error for a singleplayer game made almost 20 years ago. If you google ""Final Fantasy VII Bad Gateway 502,"" you'll get several pages of people having the same problem dating back to 2013 with no fix or resolution to be found.			"

												I didn't play video games as a child so I missed out on a lot of classics. Had a bit of trouble with the version on the PSN, tried using an emulator on my laptop but it kept giving me audio trouble and I just felt frustrated and bored.I bought this  version because I wanted to play the rest of the story myself and the remake announcement reminded me how much I love Aerith. I replayed all my progress from the past few months in a few days.The PC version is great, really easy to play with a gamepad. I didn't miss save states or any of the extras from the emulated version. It really sucked me into the story for the first time. Initially I was frustrated with the pre-rendered backgrounds but they grew on me. Very beautiful. It's really easy to get pulled into this universe.Gripes:I'm annoyed you have to make a square enix account to play the game. The site goes down all the time. The cloud saving rarely works and I reccomend turning it off if you are going to be saving a lot (like grinding on the world map etc). Also I didn't use the character boost because I didn't need it. I may try it on another playthrough though.			"

												There's no doubt that this game is a classic, whether you like or not. But if it's actually held up all these years, that's a little more subjective.Expect blocky character models and low resolution (but still quite good looking, IMO) static backgrounds, and all the spelling and grammar errors from the original PC release are still here. However, the music has been replaced, the original MIDI soundtrack is now the same music used in the Playstation release, and the game overall has been optimized to run on new systems. The actual game mechanics and combat system are solid, and the story is also still good.If you've never played the game, don't come in expecting something that can stack up to a game released today in terms of graphical quality. If you can look past its age there's still a great game and plenty of time to be wasted in it, though. If you're looking for a nostalgia kick then it's definitely worth the price as well.The only detractor from what's overall a good game is the extra layer of DRM, requiring a Square Enix account, but considering it can be activated with your Steam account and ignored once you set it up the first time, it's hardly a hassle.

												Ok, I was really doubting this game. I thought it wasn't going to be as all the fanboys says it would be. ""OH MAH GAWD THIS IS BEST GAME EBER"" basically that. So I played alittle and I'm like, it's alright. But let's say a year later, a really good youtube channel (The Completionists') were doing a special on FF7. Since I saw that, I'm like, ""Hey! Why not finish this game so I don't get any spoilers from the video!"" It jurastically changed from that. I couldn't stop playing. It's like it was sucking me into this game. Although if it weren't for the PS1 music patch for this game, I wouldn't be here and playing this version, because I would be playing on the PS1 (but if I would have, it would take years because I never get on my PS1 on a daily basis). The graphics are a step up, and if you see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs this one, you only see that the character models are more high-def, and the pre-rendered graphics are displayed in a better resolution. Other than that, there is no difference gameplay-wise, except for the SUPER-OP character booster. What it does is that it makes any 3 of your characters in your party right now have 9999 hp and 999 mp (I'm not sure on the gil, it wasn't 99,999 but it was like 60,000 or something like that) other than that, it doesn't give you status buffs, nothing else. Just that (preety weird if you ask me, but you know, Square Enix will make anything worse *Puts on sunglasses*). It will also feel weird the first times using the keyboard, and I have found some mini-games unplayable when using my layout (A is OK, B is CANCEL, D is MENU, Space for START, Shift for SWITCH, Page Up and Down for left and right bumpers 'PS1 controller') and it is real nice that you can use an XBOX 360 controller even though I don't have one, I just use my PS3 controller and have some software to emulate the 360 (I'm not going in-depth about that). You can also use a PS2 controller, but you need an adapter (the best way to play if you ask me, but again, I don't have an adapter). In conclusion, it is the best Final Fantasy I've ever played, but not the best game I ever played.			"

												Underneath the crusty PC port is the game I love, shining like a jewel. But, with cloudsaving that, more often that not, doesn't work, an immensely rocky entry because of an account requirement for a single-player  game that should not have been a concern even months after launch on Steam, and multiple progress stealing crashes, FF7 for PC is not a game I can recommend, even as a diehard fan. It is just too much hassle, both in and out of the game.Update: Not really as upset with the game, but I still don't recommend the game, even to my friends. People who love Final Fantasy will play this regardless, just as I have. I don't encounter nearly as many crashes as I used to because I play it on a stronger computer, but have still encountered some. Cloudsaving is still a consistent problem, however. Though it works more than it doesn't, the times it doesn't are frustrating and can go on for as long as an entire day. The irony in this is that the player requires an account or linking of Facebook info, in part, because of this feature. To force a player to go to such lengths just to play a game that never required this in the first place for a feature that works so infrequently is not a good justification. This is not even mentioning that Steam has these functions covered, should the effort be put in. In text, it seems like a poor port.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is a game that I am pretty sure everyone has heard about. It is probably one of the most overrated RPGs to exist, but even so, it is actually a really great game. I personally think the story is great, and the game length is pretty long (3 PS1 discs), like most RPGs should be. The battles are in a classic turn based style, which I really enjoy. The graphics have a very slight upgrade in this version compared to the original that looks quite nice. If you are an RPG fan and for some reason you haven't played this game yet, play it!			"

												What could I ever write here that hasn't been said before. I remember putting in 70+ hours into this game when it first arrived to Playstation back in 1997. What I can say is that the PC port, while not the HD remake we always hoped for, provides a little more polish than it's 1997 counterpart and remains a distinct landmark in the Final Fantasy series.Graphics & Story: For the era it was produced in, FF7 had compelling graphics along with full motion video and a great cast of unique and interesting characters. Famous scenes such as Sephiroth's walk through the flame engulfed Nibelheim or the fateful moment in the Forgotten Capital provide the gamer with the type of immersion that has tried to be replicated through numerous games following FF7's release. Music: With Nobuo Uematsu at the helm, there was no doubt that the soundtrack would be any less than great. One-Winged Angel is one of the most memorable compositions in Video Game history and Aerith's theme provided the perfect emotional tone for that pivotal moment in the Forgotten Capital.Again not much more I can say but that I can't wait for the HD remake - 10/10Update: Mar 16, 2015Finally finished my 100% achievement file. Hoping we hear something regarding a sequel or remake in 2017 on the game's 20th anniversary. Give Final Fantasy VII a try if you've never played it before. This classic is certainly worth the time.Update: June 16, 2015Well holy hell....the remake is happening.			"

												This is one masterpiece of RPG right here. It has great story, characters, music, and it's fun to make your own decisions to see how everything turns out. Unlike other RPGs this one has pretty fast paced battles, and implements mechanics that other RPGs don't, making this game unique. The default PC controls can be a little difficult to get used to, but are easy to use in most circumstances and you can change them any way you like. One feature I like is the Limit Break feature, because getting the crap beat out of you then taking your revenge with a Braver or Cross Slash Limit Break can be very satisfiying. I can't wait to get farther in the game, and I would personally recommend this game to any fan of RPGs or Final Fantasy. My Score: 9.7			"

												Goes without saying that Final Fantasy VII was considered by some to be the best RPG on the Playstation 1. It's reputation has started to decrease in recent years with some people claiming it was always overrated, but it remains one of my personal favourite RPGs. The story and characters are still gripping and interesting, the (newly patched) PS1 soundtrack is still amazing and the game has one of the best equipment systems in the entire Final Fantasy series.The polished HD models for the PC re-release can be distracting at times, but still look a lot nicer than their PS1 emulated counterparts. I will say that after playing the game across PS1/PS2/PS3 for over 15 years, I had no idea the character models were ever supposed to have mouths outside of cutscenes. The joys of HD models!This is an absolute steal at €7 or lower, let alone the €4.41 they're asking for in the 2013 Xmas sale.			"

												New life breathed into a classic work of art. I always loved this game growing up playing it on my playstation, and now they have it with more updated graphics (without compromising the old feel we all love). One of my all time favorites. Has excellent replay value due to it's length and massive size, as well as the many hidden things and maxing out characters.			"

												""Final Fantasy Seven, stylized as FINAL FANTASY VII) is a role-playing video game developed by Square (now Square Enix) as the seventh installment in the Final Fantasy series. It was released in 1997 for the Sony PlayStation. As with many installments of the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy VII consists primarily of three major areas: an overworld map, field maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, across which the player travels between the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on chocobos and in an airship or sea vessel.On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments, consisting of 2D pre-rendered backgrounds which represent locations such as towns or forests.The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, such as a building's interior or an open grassland, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies."" -  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIIThis is a turn-based RPG, that is when in battle, you take a turn and then the enemy takes a turn. It can be tedious at times as most RPGs can be and is filled with out of the way side quests and mini-games. The game does get more difficult the further you get into the storyline, however you can always go out and over level whichever boss you happen to be stuck on. Though despite its the repetitiveness and blocky graphics, Final Fantasy VII still has some of the most memorable story lines and characters to date. I would definitely reccomend this game to the younger generation or anyone with a budget looking for something fulfilling and entertaining to play.			"

												I picked it up for the nostalgia factor and was floored by how good they got the graphics to look. The biggest advantage to buying the game on steam (other than not having to buy it from the PSN or a buy an expensive online copy) is that there are achievements now! This time when I get Knights of the Round, master all the materia, and beat emerald and ruby weapon, I can show people. Achievements and graphics that allow me to be drawn into the story for the first time in years, what's not to love?			"

												As an avid FF player, I have to say that this is my favourite game in the series.The turn based battle system is great. A complex and very intriguing storyline with likeable and relatable characters brings the story to life. You have endless sidequests to do that can take away the edge of grinding. If you are not a fan of grinding for exp and levels, then this game may not be for you. It has great replayability. If you like RPGs and do not mind reading vast amounts of dialogue, then I highly reccommend checking this game out! If the news of the remake has brought you here, then give the original a chance! You will not be disappointed.			"

												If you haven't played Final Fantasy 7, then you probably don't like JRPGs anyways. That said, it's probably the quintessential posterchild for modern day JRPGs, and one of the games that helped bring them to the mainstream. Final Fantasy 7 is easily one of the better JRPGs ever made, but also one of the most overrated. Also keep in mind, this game requires you to be always online, for DRM purposes, but gives no real benefits to this requirement other than Achievements. If you are wanting to play a JRPG, and are unable to find an original disc of this game, then this is the best alternative.			"

												FF7 was the most groundbreaking RPG of its era. It was the edge that gave Sony dominance in the console market, the hammerblow to Nintendo's pride and the straw that broke Sega's back. It represents the pinnacle of Sqauresoft's history and in the eyes of many, no single player RPG has come close since. It also spawned one of the most recognisable bad guys in gaming history. The heavy anime style gives it a very Japanese feel, Nobuo's music is fantastic, from the energetic guitar based battle themes to the heartwrenchingly sorrowful Aerith's theme. A game that excited a generation, filling our heads with unforgettable memories of an awesome, immersive experience. It's a must play for any hardcore RPG fanatic.			"

												One of the best Final Fantasy's ever.  The story is awesome.  The graphics were top of the line back in its day, but today look terrible.  It's still an all around excellent game.  There aren't many RPG's that can top this one.  It's totally worth every hard earned dollar that you put forth for this title.			"

												Ok, I was really doubting this game. I thought it wasn't going to be as all the fanboys says it would be. ""OH MAH GAWD THIS IS BEST GAME EBER"" basically that. So I played alittle and I'm like, it's alright. But let's say a year later, a really good youtube channel (The Completionists') were doing a special on FF7. Since I saw that, I'm like, ""Hey! Why not finish this game so I don't get any spoilers from the video!"" It jurastically changed from that. I couldn't stop playing. It's like it was sucking me into this game. Although if it weren't for the PS1 music patch for this game, I wouldn't be here and playing this version, because I would be playing on the PS1 (but if I would have, it would take years because I never get on my PS1 on a daily basis). The graphics are a step up, and if you see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs this one, you only see that the character models are more high-def, and the pre-rendered graphics are displayed in a better resolution. Other than that, there is no difference gameplay-wise, except for the SUPER-OP character booster. What it does is that it makes any 3 of your characters in your party right now have 9999 hp and 999 mp (I'm not sure on the gil, it wasn't 99,999 but it was like 60,000 or something like that) other than that, it doesn't give you status buffs, nothing else. Just that (preety weird if you ask me, but you know, Square Enix will make anything worse *Puts on sunglasses*). It will also feel weird the first times using the keyboard, and I have found some mini-games unplayable when using my layout (A is OK, B is CANCEL, D is MENU, Space for START, Shift for SWITCH, Page Up and Down for left and right bumpers 'PS1 controller') and it is real nice that you can use an XBOX 360 controller even though I don't have one, I just use my PS3 controller and have some software to emulate the 360 (I'm not going in-depth about that). You can also use a PS2 controller, but you need an adapter (the best way to play if you ask me, but again, I don't have an adapter). In conclusion, it is the best Final Fantasy I've ever played, but not the best game I ever played.			"

												With the upcoming remake of Final Fantasy VII there will definitely be mixed reviews about which is better. the remake or the original? The least any newcomer to the Final Fantasy franchise can do is to play the original first before any potential shortcomings the remake may have to offer.For most the 1997 release was their first Final Fantasy and is therefore special to them. Upon replaying FFVII on Steam I had such an overwealming nostalgia which quite honestly surprised me. I could remember everything so clearly even after almost 20 years since first playing it. Everything was the same as I had imagined it even back then, though I will say that this updated version has a few things which had been changed. Certain dialogue and so on, though I don't think this is such a major issue to many.The Materia system is still top notch, though now I am certainly more cautious with what I use instead of throwing everything on a character just because I had it, as I would have done on my first playthrough. Plenty of mini games to keep one entertained when sick of grinding or just want to take a break from the story. The battle system was exciting for its time, especially with the added Limit Breaks which were a huge improvement on VI's Desperation Attacks. which were quite frankly rubbish. The fact you could save the special attack for a better time as well as evolve them into better ones by using them was a reason to try out every character, just to see what they did. With the new release, the old battle system will certainly be dead and buried so we can probably say goodbye to many of the epic moves and abilities we once encountered.The soundtrack? 11/10. Nuff said.If anything, this is one of my least favourite Final Fantasies in the franchise, though it was my first. Even though I prefer most of the others, this truly is a special game that will not only challenge you, but become a part of you in the process. It can be a bit of an eyesore to look at in this day and age, but if you love a story rich game then there's nothing really stopping you from buying this game.			"

												There's no doubt that this game is a classic, whether you like or not. But if it's actually held up all these years, that's a little more subjective.Expect blocky character models and low resolution (but still quite good looking, IMO) static backgrounds, and all the spelling and grammar errors from the original PC release are still here. However, the music has been replaced, the original MIDI soundtrack is now the same music used in the Playstation release, and the game overall has been optimized to run on new systems. The actual game mechanics and combat system are solid, and the story is also still good.If you've never played the game, don't come in expecting something that can stack up to a game released today in terms of graphical quality. If you can look past its age there's still a great game and plenty of time to be wasted in it, though. If you're looking for a nostalgia kick then it's definitely worth the price as well.The only detractor from what's overall a good game is the extra layer of DRM, requiring a Square Enix account, but considering it can be activated with your Steam account and ignored once you set it up the first time, it's hardly a hassle.

The Materia game mechanic is the culmination or all learnt from the years spent developing the prior 6 games, no complex trees needed, but still allows for an absolutely staggering amount of choice and strategy.The storyline is hands down one of the most interesting in all of gaming history, while providing challenges and some of the most fun minigames throughout.I wish Steams inaugural gaming awards allowed a game to be nominated for multiple categories as it would have received nominations across multiple categories from me.

												If you haven't played Final Fantasy 7, then you probably don't like JRPGs anyways. That said, it's probably the quintessential posterchild for modern day JRPGs, and one of the games that helped bring them to the mainstream. Final Fantasy 7 is easily one of the better JRPGs ever made, but also one of the most overrated. Also keep in mind, this game requires you to be always online, for DRM purposes, but gives no real benefits to this requirement other than Achievements. If you are wanting to play a JRPG, and are unable to find an original disc of this game, then this is the best alternative.			"

												This game is definately one of the best RPGs EVER!A game is so much more that state of the art visuals like you see nowadays.Playing only a few minutes you can see that the music and the story create an atmosphere that sucks you in immedately. Together with an excellent sense of humor there is only one thing you can say about this game: Everything has been done right!The music became a classic, seen tons of remakes. The character development finds hardly a game that matches this. Not in sense of simply leveling up, finding/upgrading items but in developing an personality. That fact I missed on FF 8 where the main caracter stays to cool and emotionless.  The game itself is from 1997 and I played it in the early 2000. And it still drags me into the story. I love to see it on sale again. But having a boxed version is priceless :P			"

												As an avid FF player, I have to say that this is my favourite game in the series.The turn based battle system is great. A complex and very intriguing storyline with likeable and relatable characters brings the story to life. You have endless sidequests to do that can take away the edge of grinding. If you are not a fan of grinding for exp and levels, then this game may not be for you. It has great replayability. If you like RPGs and do not mind reading vast amounts of dialogue, then I highly reccommend checking this game out! If the news of the remake has brought you here, then give the original a chance!

De los mejores juegos de rol de la historia, quizás, el mejor.Pro:-Poder disfrutar del juego que enganchó a millones de jugadores al género RPG.-Quizás la mejor histora o guión que ha habido en toda la historia de los videojuegos.-Logros relativamente fáciles de conseguir.-Banda sonora inigualable.Contra:-Graficos y sonidos de su época...-Malísima traducción al español, faltas de ortografía.-Se hace algo corto.

												With only 2 hours in at the time of writing this review, I can tell you that if it took you this long to finally play this game for the first time, I would highly recommend to wait for the remake. The gameplay and visuals don't pass the test of time, especially when you consider what Final Fantasy 8 brought. So far, I prefer everything about Final Fantasy 6 to that of this game, but that doesn't mean I'm going to drop it when the story hasn't even brought me out of Midgar.			"

												As an avid FF player, I have to say that this is my favourite game in the series.The turn based battle system is great. A complex and very intriguing storyline with likeable and relatable characters brings the story to life. You have endless sidequests to do that can take away the edge of grinding. If you are not a fan of grinding for exp and levels, then this game may not be for you. It has great replayability. If you like RPGs and do not mind reading vast amounts of dialogue, then I highly reccommend checking this game out! If the news of the remake has brought you here, then give the original a chance! You will not be disappointed.			"

												I was one of those people who never played the game when it released, as I did not own a PS1. I now see why so many people list it as ""greatest game ever"". I wouldn't rate it as my ""greatest video game ever"" but it is certainly a very good game. My first experience with the game was around 1999 and even then I felt like these graphics were pretty dated compared to games such as Ocarina of Time, but the gameplay still holds up well in 2017. I have not finished the game yet but have put in a lot of hours, and so far the story is very good, and the gameplay itself has held up well. If you're a younger gamer I'm not sure if you'll be able to appreciate the highly 1990s nature of this game, but I grew up on Genesis/SNES/N64 and can say that this is definitely one of the games of its generation that have aged well.For the people complaining about the Square Enix servers, I created my account when I first started the game and immediately unchecked the ""Cloud Saves"" option in settings, and have never had an issue with trying to play the game other than one crash when I was near the end of the ""Disc 1"" (of 3) content of the original release.

												Still one of the best RPGs of all time, FFVII is a name that pretty much everybody knows at this point. This is a decent version to get if you haven't played it or just want to experience it again. My only real gripes are that they didn't really update at all in this version, and that stupid square enix launcher they force you to use. This version does include cloud saves and built in cheat codes, as well as steam achievements. Even for this version's flaws, it's still a fantastic game, and you can even use mods on this one to change it up.			"

												I don't know where to start, but FFVII is one of my fav game for years now. When I first met with the title Final Fantasy, it was on my PSX many years ago. Right now the visuals are outdated. Ofcourse they are, because the game is 16-17 years old (almost an adult). But still one of the best jrpg out there in my opinion. You could ask me, that why is it so good, I will tell it, but remember, these are only MY opinions, not facts. First, i loved the whole story, the flashbacks, backgrounds of the characters. Second, i rly loved almost every music in the game (Imo Cosmo Canyon Theme is the best). And the third, that i like the most and miss in many other games, these are the mini games. For me the most fun was the Chocobo racing and the Chocobo farm. And one more thing, if I'm correct, then FFVII was the Game of the year in 1997. And one little thing, if anyone saw the movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, but never tried the game, then I highly recommend atleast 1 playthrough.Update:Oh boy and I'm still waiting for the FF7 Remake. Sadly it will be a PS4 exclusive title, but for me still a must have and the only reason to buy a PS4.			"

												Let me preface by saying that Final Fantasy VII is the last American release (by order of release date) that I have completed in the series, so far.  It is a classic, in that other video games in the role-playing genre are still compared to it today--with good reason.  I loved this game when it was released over fifteen years ago, and I still love it today.So let's focus on the negatives, starting with the most egregious problems: whomever was placed in charge of reprogramming this game for the computer put new mouths on those characters that lacked them (i.e. Sephiroth, Jessie, etc.).  Unfortunately, they used just the one mouth position: a whorish ""O.""  Suddenly every character with a new mouth has taken on the appearance of a blow-up pleasure doll, an image that is only reinforced by the early 3D animation.  It is NOT a pretty sight.For the Uninitiated: Players might be frustrated with some of the unintentional difficulties of an EARLY attempt at 3D gaming, specifically movement.  There is something of a learning curve with materia.  The graphics are dated.  Some of the mini-games are terrible (though most are thankfully avoidable).  I would also highly recommend purchasing (or at least looking up via internet) a guide, as not every quest is terribly clear.With that said, there are mods that can fix the mouth problem.  I am also grateful that some of the more distracting translation errors have been fixed since the game's first US release.  Overall, I'd recommend this game highly to anyone who's played it and wants to relive it... and for anyone else who wants to experience a classic.But seriously.  Get the mouth mod.  Sephiroth with that ""O"" face is just creepy.  Well... creepier.			"

												In my opinion; the game is a defining classic for the RPG genre.My first experience of the Final Fantasy series was with this title back in 1997 and at the time it was absolutely incredible. This was different to any other game I had played, the story was rich and enthralling, the score and graphics were both bright and vibrant but also moody and atmospheric when the scene dictated it and there was so much FMV that it felt like you were playing an interactive movie. The variation in scenery, the number of side activities, the secrets and the challenges keep this game alive for days longer than the main story (which is fairly large in it's own right as it is).Every Final Fantasy fan has their favourite and I'm not going to argue with anyone that doesn't agree; I have played and continue to play every one of the main series titles I can lay my hands on and although each of them has their charms I would still rate VII as my first choice.

												As someone who just missed this game when it came out, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy it so many years later, especially with so much hype around it.  Much to my great excitement, it not only held up, but far exceeded my expectations!  The story was great, with so many more twists than the lone one everyone knows, and the characters really stand out as some of the most colorful I've experienced.  If you're like me and have always meant to play this game but just haven't had a chance, snag yourself a copy and enjoy!(A note: The cloud saving is off by default and very finicky.  If you only intend to play on one computer, this won't be a problem, as it will just save locally.  If you plan on playing across a couple computers, you should go into the settings from the launch screen and enable cloud saving before you start to save yourself some trouble.)			"

												Return to Midgar and defeat Shinra. A classic Final Fantasy that everyone loves and enjoys time and time again. Through the emotion, the sadness and the hardships. A game that should be experienced by all. If it really helps you to conclude the story play in this order:Crisis Core (PSP)Final Fantasy VII (PSX/PC)Advent Children (DVD/BluRay)Dirge of Cerberus (PS2)And then the story will be finished. Probably the most overatted Final Fantasy in existance with that much just to explain the lore and mythology of Final Fantasy VII, but it's still good nonetheless. But I think why it get's so much praise, it's the first game that a lot of people played first and introduced them to the RPG genre. But I honestly don't praise it that much... But it's good in it's own right. But do take it from me; Play it!			"

An engaging if at times goofy eco-terrorism main plot, buoyed by charming yet constantly out-of-place diversions makes for a fun, quality RPG experience; one that has made me add all the other FFs on steam to my wish list.

Since this was a known issue (folder redirection) several years ago, and they didn't bother to fix this I'm not recommending this version to anyone, especially with the additional account logon and separate launcher. They just botched an awesome game at Square.			"

												I absolutely loved this game on the PS1 and when this was released on steam my wallet jumped out of my pants from the other room and started to fill out my payment information! I was petrified to see this very odd encounter that was unfolding before my very eyes. Once the payment was complete and of course printing out my confirmation email and carefully writing down my confirmation number for my personal records I quickly installed and attempted to play my newly but oddly obtained copy of Final Fantasy 7!  I checked all the options within the launcher to make sure the upmost  compatibility. I click play and my screen goes black...appears this very ominous logo on my screen ""SQUARESOFT"". I wait.....I wait some more....I click, I press ESC, my heart begins to race as this mysterious logo just stays on my screen! I rapidly start spamming all the keys on my keyboard! nothing happens! I finally Ctrl+alt+tab and I become blinded by this blueish-green screen with a few options. I choose ""Open Task Manager"" and a new window appears! I decide to put this horrible experience to an end, I had to make this my seventh and final attempt to live this fantasy.			"

												Even after 16 years since it's original release, Final Fantasy VII is, without a doubt, one of the absolute best RPGs in existence. It's characters, story, and gameplay are some of the finest the JRPG market has ever had. This is a game that anyone should play through at least once. This port of the classic is definently worth purchasing for both veterans of FFVII and first-timers alike. Cloud saving is a very nifty feature that allows you to play your saves on multiple computers, although there are occasionaly network issues with it. The character booster will be a great tool for those who want to observe the story rather than focus on hours of grinding. The textures have been polished up nicely, and the FMVs look a lot smoother than before. Overall, this is a gaming experience worth having, and this is the perfect version for those who wish to try it for the first time. My only recommendation: Make sure you have a controller, as the standard keyboard controls are a bit wonky.			"

												I'll make it simple.The DRM has turned me off from what should have been a lovely trip down memory lane. What blows me away is that I cannot even play a single player game without either giving out my Facebook credentials or creating a Square Enix account. Games for Windows Live did not work and neither will this. Learn something Square.Not only that, but the 'reset password' function on your website does not even work so I cannot recover an account that I apparently made with you. AND. I can't login using my Facebook unless I agree to let them post on my behalf. In my infrequently humble opinion, this is a mood killer. You know why? Because the only thing that let me play the game was allowing it to hijack my Facebook. Final Fantasy sucked after 10, you're not going to piggyback on my account just to talk about how great your recent 'products' are (if they could be called that). So needless to say, I revoked that permission and uninstalled.I loved this game growing up and still love it and nothing breaks my heart more than to have spent money on it and to realize that I'm going to download a cracked copy anyways just to bypass this incredibly uneccessary and ridiculous DRM. Avoid this version of the game everyone. Unless you have a Square Enix account handy (hopefully you remember your password) or have no problem giving away all your details on Facebook to a company that believes you cannot be trusted with a re-release of a PC port of one of their most popular titles ever and arguably one of the most popular RPGs ever released on the planet, you're not missing out.Dust off your PSX or PS2 and get an original copy. It will be less of a hassle than running it in this garbage version.I can't describe how thoroughly disappointed I am in you Square.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is about a stuggling jack of all trades who, at one point, questions his sexual outlook. After spending some time living as a lady in the slums, he realises he isn't meant for such roots and decides to wage war on the local pimp who ♥♥♥♥♥s out woman as if they were objects.Together, with the help of his female companions, they strike down the slumdog pimp and soon set their sites on bigger motions in works, Why stop the lesser evils when they can overthrow a government who oppress their people in order to gain monopoly for themselves?Our hero, Cloud, then sets off, hesitantly, on his way to see change brought to the land and its people. Through trying times, he bonds well with those around him and gains invaluable strength and bravey through out. Soon the group learn they are in way over their heads when they come across a talking dog, who's tail is constantly on fire (he doesn't seem to mind, though), and through the actions of said dog, they learn of a great evil at work. Sephiroth.Sephiroth was once a mentor, an idol and symbol of hope to Cloud, and the world at large. However, after learning of dark secrets kept from him, Sephiroth seeks vegence on those who wronged him - the Goverment known as Shinra. He learns he is nothing more than a lab experiment and that his mother was an alien. Naturally, Sephiroth is all like ""hold the damn phone here, guys... The hell is this?"" - having never met his mother, his desire to be passionately held becomes unbearable, to the point of dangerous obsession. He even steals her dead head.So, Cloud and his merry crew, who at this point are like ""... This guy is mental, he's trying to summon a meteor with magic to kill everyone on the planet because he has mother issues... We should really do something about that"", go about in search of an even greater evil. That being Septhiroth.After some forsakend, unforgiveable, and downright ♥♥♥♥ing twisted,♥♥♥♥♥♥sucking, lego ♥♥♥♥ing, herpes ridden deaths and Cloud loosing his mind, because, you know... He isn't actually the person he thinks he is, they confront Septhiroth, give him a slap on the rest and tell him ""Mummy said you should be a good boy now"".That's pretty much Final Fantasy VII, oh and there's also naked men bouncing around on beds, girls dressed as beads... I mean BEES, some weird ninja girl obsessed with stealing and a dude with a gun for and arm who suffers with suicidal tendancy. Oh and there is Zack Fair. And snow boarding, there's also a dating simulation thing in there.

												While this review is labeled as negative, my feelings on this game are very mixed. I feel that all the hype and love that it has is mostly nostalgia based, and people aren't exactly capable of seeing it in a current critical eye. Though I still suggest that if you haven't played this game before that you should at least try it. Just because someone on the internet doesn't like it doesn't mean that you should be turned off by this game. If it has such a strong fan-base after all these years, it should                         still be played to at least try to see where everyone is coming from. Though you should go into this game knowing that it hasn't exactly aged well since 1997.			"

												There are no words for how disappointed I am with this version of FF7. Required log ins, midi music tracks instead of the playstation ones, grainy super low-res video, stretched rather then up-scaled textures and world maps, and last but not least a confusing control scheme. This isn't a 2013 rerelease, its the exact same pc port from 1998 with the only differances being achievements and that you have to log in now.  Other then that Square-Enix didn't even put in the most trival effort to improve the game. Thankfully there are modders out there doing what Square-Enix is too lazy to and much more. If you don't mind losing the trainer and achievements I'd look into the various graphic and gameplay enchancement mods availible on the net to make the game at very least more playable.Edit: The midi music was due to a bad download. After deleting the local files and reinstalling I found I had PSX music. Still not going to recommend this game though, as the only way I found it playable is with the Tifas Bootleg mod compolation.			"

												I love Final fantasy 7. I played it when I was about 8-9 years old and beat my first one about a year later.  Why I don't recomend the game is the simple fact that it crashes with the saves the game provides. Hence leaving your hard worked hours worthless.			"

												While this review is labeled as negative, my feelings on this game are very mixed. I feel that all the hype and love that it has is mostly nostalgia based, and people aren't exactly capable of seeing it in a current critical eye. Though I still suggest that if you haven't played this game before that you should at least try it. Just because someone on the internet doesn't like it doesn't mean that you should be turned off by this game. If it has such a strong fan-base after all these years, it should                         still be played to at least try to see where everyone is coming from. Though you should go into this game knowing that it hasn't exactly aged well since 1997.			"

												A must-have for the die-hard FF fan I suppose, but not really much for the kind of person who watched it getting played. Best played with a controller, because via keyboard is just painful. Also, while the *sprites* may be up-rezzed, the backgrounds are not.			"

												I have replayed Final Fantasy VII many times on the playstation and will continue to do so on steam. It was and still is one of my favourite games to play endless amounts of hours on. I love the fact it has achievements on steam and even though some will take hours to get, i still enjoyed the journey of 100 percent completing this game.  Whether your a fan of Final Fantasies or just a JRPG fan, this game will give you plenty of things to do.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is about a stuggling jack of all trades who, at one point, questions his sexual outlook. After spending some time living as a lady in the slums, he realises he isn't meant for such roots and decides to wage war on the local pimp who ♥♥♥♥♥s out woman as if they were objects.Together, with the help of his female companions, they strike down the slumdog pimp and soon set their sites on bigger motions in works, Why stop the lesser evils when they can overthrow a government who oppress their people in order to gain monopoly for themselves?Our hero, Cloud, then sets off, hesitantly, on his way to see change brought to the land and its people. Through trying times, he bonds well with those around him and gains invaluable strength and bravey through out. Soon the group learn they are in way over their heads when they come across a talking dog, who's tail is constantly on fire (he doesn't seem to mind, though), and through the actions of said dog, they learn of a great evil at work. Sephiroth.Sephiroth was once a mentor, an idol and symbol of hope to Cloud, and the world at large. However, after learning of dark secrets kept from him, Sephiroth seeks vegence on those who wronged him - the Goverment known as Shinra. He learns he is nothing more than a lab experiment and that his mother was an alien. Naturally, Sephiroth is all like ""hold the damn phone here, guys... The hell is this?"" - having never met his mother, his desire to be passionately held becomes unbearable, to the point of dangerous obsession. He even steals her dead head.So, Cloud and his merry crew, who at this point are like ""... This guy is mental, he's trying to summon a meteor with magic to kill everyone on the planet because he has mother issues... We should really do something about that"", go about in search of an even greater evil. That being Septhiroth.After some forsakend, unforgiveable, and downright ♥♥♥♥ing twisted,♥♥♥♥♥♥sucking, lego ♥♥♥♥ing, herpes ridden deaths and Cloud loosing his mind, because, you know... He isn't actually the person he thinks he is, they confront Septhiroth, give him a slap on the rest and tell him ""Mummy said you should be a good boy now"".That's pretty much Final Fantasy VII, oh and there's also naked men bouncing around on beds, girls dressed as beads... I mean BEES, some weird ninja girl obsessed with stealing and a dude with a gun for and arm who suffers with suicidal tendancy. Oh and there is Zack Fair. And snow boarding, there's also a dating simulation thing in there. Did I mention future seeing stuffed animals with cats on their heads who are controlled by some dude in a goverment building?9/10.			"

												I absolutely loved this game on the PS1 and when this was released on steam my wallet jumped out of my pants from the other room and started to fill out my payment information! I was petrified to see this very odd encounter that was unfolding before my very eyes. Once the payment was complete and of course printing out my confirmation email and carefully writing down my confirmation number for my personal records I quickly installed and attempted to play my newly but oddly obtained copy of Final Fantasy 7!  I checked all the options within the launcher to make sure the upmost  compatibility. I click play and my screen goes black...appears this very ominous logo on my screen ""SQUARESOFT"". I wait.....I wait some more....I click, I press ESC, my heart begins to race as this mysterious logo just stays on my screen! I rapidly start spamming all the keys on my keyboard! nothing happens! I finally Ctrl+alt+tab and I become blinded by this blueish-green screen with a few options. I choose ""Open Task Manager"" and a new window appears! I decide to put this horrible experience to an end, I had to make this my seventh and final attempt to live this fantasy.			"

												Great game - Review is based on this version on PC not of FF7- The controls can be fine but it is poor at best with a keyboard.- You can use a gamepad but you need to rebind, not terrible- Having to log in and create a square enix account to even play is ridiculous- Better now, but there have been times you can't even play because something would be wrong with the square server or site so you couldn't play as you have to be ""logged in"" despite this being on steam.This is basically just the FF7 game that came out quite a few years ago on pc, except they put it behind having a Square Enix account and slapped it on Steam.If you want to play this game and you don't have a playstation and the disks I guess you could do worse as it is cheap during sales, but even 11 dollars is a bit much normally, otherwise just avoid on Steam specifically as it is just a money grab I made the mistake of buying into.

The story is amazing, but the game slows down a bit due to annoying mini games and some aweful music.  The midi music did not age well and has been ported to an MP3 format. If you are not a fan of the series, this is a good place to start.			"

												Well well, what must I say about this game, voted as one of the greatest video games of all time, seen as one of the best games in the Final Fantasy franchise, and known for its colossal impact on gaming? Well. If your a gamer like me, who plays games by heart and not eyes (heart being story and eyes being blown away from games featuring explosions guns and violence), then this is a game for YOU. Before I go in depth of how amazing this game is, I must tell you how I got into the Final Fantasy franchise. As a kid I shied away from the series because honestly the roman numerals in the games was just too confusing and at the time I was a strict Nintendo fanboy. Times have changed, I am no longer a strict Nintendo fanboy though I still am but now I accept other games. I gave Final Fantasy 1 a try and quickly got hooked. Then I moved on to 2 and at that point it was clear I am now a Final Fantasy fanboy. I then went to 3, and at the time (all of this happened recently btw), there was a Steam deal going on. The Square Enix publisher discount stuff. Final Fantasy 7 and 8 were in that, and I had some spare change and decided it would be a fantastic idea to purchase two Final Fantasy games with the highest amount of reputation within the franchise. I did not regret that decision, it was clearly worth buying. Now, back to our discussion on why the game is great. This game, is addictive. No, not addictive in a bad way like Minecraft (You know, playing all day losing your mind). Addictive story-wise. The story in this game is ENGAGING ON SOO MANY LEVELS. IT DOES NOT AT ALL FEEL LIKE I AM PLAYING A GAME ITSELF, BUT WATCHING A MOVIE WITH A DEEP STORY AND AMAZING CUTSCENES AND FLASHBACKS. The gameplay itself is interesting and apealing to me. When I play the game, I don't care for the gameplay, I am anxious to see what happens next in the story. When a game gets you feeling like this, it is clear why Final Fantasy 7 is regarded or arguably one of the greatest games of all time. Its games like this one we just don't see anymore, it really does suck because I myself wish that these games with all these DLC's and micro-transactions would just STOP and use this game as an analogy to what a perfect game should be. This game is a classic, I had no problems with it other than how frustrating it was to get my freakin Square Enix account setup. If you can get past that one problem, you got yourself a perfect beautiful game right here. In conclusion, I say if you are one who enjoys a great story with fun gameplay, then this game is worth your 12 dollars. Or, at the moment if the deal is still going, its half off.			"

												This game has a faulty fullscreen mode that makes your game go all black and freeze if you switch between open programs. Why? I do not wish to play with a visible Windows UI to counter a problem that should have been fixed upon release. That I have to make a Square Enix account to play this game is awful. Their services are buggy and it is a hassle. Fix this mess, please. Why do I have to play accountception to get access to a game I have PAID for? It is far easier and more convenient for me to download this game illegally - that is a sad, sad fact.Square Enix, please discontinue your bad service and embrace Steam.			"

												As someone who just missed this game when it came out, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy it so many years later, especially with so much hype around it.  Much to my great excitement, it not only held up, but far exceeded my expectations!  The story was great, with so many more twists than the lone one everyone knows, and the characters really stand out as some of the most colorful I've experienced.  If you're like me and have always meant to play this game but just haven't had a chance, snag yourself a copy and enjoy!(A note: The cloud saving is off by default and very finicky.  If you only intend to play on one computer, this won't be a problem, as it will just save locally.  If you plan on playing across a couple computers, you should go into the settings from the launch screen and enable cloud saving before you start to save yourself some trouble.)			"

												There are no words for how disappointed I am with this version of FF7. Required log ins, midi music tracks instead of the playstation ones, grainy super low-res video, stretched rather then up-scaled textures and world maps, and last but not least a confusing control scheme. This isn't a 2013 rerelease, its the exact same pc port from 1998 with the only differances being achievements and that you have to log in now.  Other then that Square-Enix didn't even put in the most trival effort to improve the game. Thankfully there are modders out there doing what Square-Enix is too lazy to and much more. If you don't mind losing the trainer and achievements I'd look into the various graphic and gameplay enchancement mods availible on the net to make the game at very least more playable.Edit: The midi music was due to a bad download. After deleting the local files and reinstalling I found I had PSX music. Still not going to recommend this game though, as the only way I found it playable is with the Tifas Bootleg mod compolation.			"

												At first glance, this looks like something great to get. And I will admit, it looks and runs as smooth as you would expect from a computer version, but the game has ONE fatal flaw.If you have to alt-enter out of the game, you CANNOT get back into the game or do ANYTHING on your PC. I'm using a windows 8.1 PC, and have had to hard reset my laptop because when I tried to alt-enter back into the game, the screen turns black. All functionality remains, but you cant see a thing on the desktop. You can open anything on the taskbar, or from the Start menu, but you cannot see it. You can't get FF7 to re display the graphics, and you cant get the screen to display anything but black. I dont know it I'm the only one who has experienced this issue, but this is a REAL game killer for me.			"

												One of the first games I played on a PS one many many years ago, still holds up today, immersive world, great story, simple combat mechanics but deep with the equipment and materia combinations. Midway through, plot twist blew my mind back then and it still haunts me today as one of the most epic moments in gaming... I really thought: ""no.. they can't actually do that!! OMGBBQ THEY JUST DID THAT!!""Great game well worth it! i'm slowly playing it back again to get them achievements!			"

												What more can be said about this game that you probably haven't already heard? It's going on almost 20 years old and highly regarded as one of the classic JRPGs to set the standard for quality, story, innovation, battle mechanics, and more. If you've heard about this game and never played it, there's a reason. It has some of the most interesting settings and characters, even by today's standards. When this game released in 1997, the graphics were hailed as some of the best out there. Although they may not hold up to that these days, they are still colorful and fun. In all honesty, I still think they're good.If you have not played this game, do yourself a favor and buy it. I consider it the best Final Fantasy in the series, and I've played almost all of them.

												Final Fantasy VII brought us all into the world of Final Fantasy, but just not in any way. It brought the stories and worlds we grew up loving into a 3D masterpiece. It was and still is one of the best Final Fantasies in my opinion. For those who are reliving the tale of Cloud, enjoy it yet again on Steam! I don't know about you guys, but when I heard of the remake it made me want to experience the original for what it is. I have beat it so many times and have done everything there is in the game. The only thing I didn't get to experience was achievements. I went ahead and bought it here so that I could relive the tale once more and to challange myself in the achievements. I encourage you all to relive our Fantasy yet again and shoot for the stars. Now for someone that didn't live in this era and experienced it during the time it was released, may look at it and compair it to todays tech. I urge you to look past that and remember that this was the first Final Fantasy release in 3D. Final Fantasy VII was the steping stone to what we have today. Thank you for your time.			"

												I have easily put 2000+ hours into this game on my old Ps3. This game has brought me nothing but happieness and joy for many years in my life. This franchise is filled with a brimming amount of brilliance and all have a very distinct deep story. Square Enix is a brilliant game producer I praise them for these games. The franchise and this game in general was so stunning and mind blown away by this game. The controls seem a bit wonky since this game was not ment to be played with a keyboard but still very playable.This game is said to be rumoured the best game in the world in some peoples opinions for a reason ( In other peoples opinions im just unbias to that opinion). The graphics may not be top 2016 era but during the time this was released these graphichs were easily the best around. I purchased this game very recently for the nostalgiac feeling and for that great time I had when I was a kid playing this. If you are considering to get a great, playable and deep game that is an RPG I highly suggest this game. I loved it, Played it and Beat it. I hope you have an enjoyable time as I did when I was a kid.Please Consider This Game It's Awesome! :)			"

												The game has aged quite a bit and although this game doesnt look the best, if your looking to get into final fantasy this game is a must for PC. Now although this game is amazing and has sold millions worldwide in its day, the reality is it may not be your style of game. Final Fantasy 7 features a turn based sytem which may be a hit or a miss for you but also allows for intense and strategic battles. We also have to take into account that the game doesnt look amazing, and this factor could be a miss for people since the characters look like lego but the PC version does somewhat fix this issue with mods to make the character models in the game look a little bit better and more desirable to look at. If you can look past the graphics this game has a well written story to really put you into the world of ff7. Also time, this game takes some time to finish which is good and bad but we have to take into account that not everyone likes long games. This game goes for a long time and will take up a lot of time but if your like me and dont mind the graphics, long gameplay and turn based system then this is a must buy and is a garuntee you will enjoy this game if you give it a chance.However if your not a fan of turn based but want to enjoy the ff7 story square enix is making a ps4 ff7 that will not feature a turn based style and has better graphics so you could wait for that game to release. But if your just looking to get into a ff game and want something new or that looks decent id reccomend ff10 and possibly ff13 although ff13 is a huge hit or miss for people. If you still dont like the turn base system ff15 releases on the 29th of november and looks promising for the ps4 and xbox one however a pc release is unknown at the momment sadly.OVERALL: the game is a 9.5 out of 10 considering the game has aged fairly well and that needs to be taken into account but despit the graphics you are looking at a very fun game that will consume your life until completion.

Everything before and after VII just doesn't quite hit the mark.... VI comes close.			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said about this legendary game.If you love JRPGs, story-rich games, and so forth, then you should buy this game.Great game, great soundtrack, great story, sure the graphics are dated, but you are probably quite a shallow and ignorant fool if you ignore Final Fantasy VII and play Final Fantasy XIII instead; don't judge the book by its cover or game by its graphics.10 out of 10, will totally come play this game again one day like I have every other year since the game originally came out about twenty years ago on the PS1.If you have not had this game's story spoiled for you, just get it now and play it now and love it now like I have and so many others have before you.

												For years I've avoided this game, mainly going by the kind of reviews that currently plague this Steam page.  But, I decided to take a leap of faith, and guess what?  The game is awesome, and highly recommended if you've been playing the PSX version through an emulator to get slightly better graphics, and especially to those that have been rocking the older PC version, which was buggy and contaned inferior music tracks.  Let's check off the list of improvements, eh?- Overall smoother looking graphics AND backgrounds- Same music as the original PlayStation game- ""Easy"" mode that boosts all of your stats so you just enjoy the story (requires Cloud save and to be online)- Can be modded if you want (though outside of Steam)To be clear, you DO have to create a Square Enix account, but I've only had to login once and never again.  Try that with your Origin or UbiPlay games.  And to all those people complaining about have to be online, this is what happens if you want Cloud saving and are online with Steam.  If you don't want this, turn off Cloud saving and you can take Steam offline.  You lose the ability to use your save between computers, but you can also be offline all the time.Now, things aren't perfect, but this is more indicative to it being based on the PC game.  While I am primarily a PC gamer, FFVII just feels unnatural on the keyboard.  I'm sure that if I played a few hours I wouldn't care, but right now thinking about juggling all that materia whilst using the keyboard gives me the cold sweats.  Luckily, it does have partial controller support.  You know the drill for Steam; get a compatible controller or an app that can get you own working.So, to recap:  This game rocks!  You have to create a SQ account, but since you only login once, I don't see what is the big deal.  I mean, you have to login into Steam to get this far, don't you?  Plus, you get to cheat right out of the box (no mods required).  So, if you've always wanted to get a better looking version of FFVII, or haven't played the game but was curious as to why it is lauded so, go ahead and pick this game up.			"

												This might be the best game of all time, closely followed or tied with Fallout 2.I wish todays gamer generation could go back to when the ps1 was released and play FFVII, because it would and still might changfe the way they gauge games.When I completed FF VII it left a hole in my life, like a friend I spent so much time with had suddenly passed away.And there were nothing to substitute it with, it had such a tremendous impact on me it is hard to describe unless you experienced it firsthand.I which I could play it again for the first time.

												I recently began an epic Final Fantasy binge. I bought FFIX, FFXV, FFIII(VI in Japan) and this game.  I've only finished IX so far, but what I've played of this game, it's gonna be one of my favorites.  The combat is simple, yet engaging, the characters have great interactions, and the story(so far) has been good.  The few drawbacks I've encountered is that sometimes it's hard to maneuver in small spaces, and that with a controller, the button prompts show up as [OK], [BACK], [MENU], etc instead of A, B, X and Y.  The music is amazing, as well.  Overall, if it doesn't take a major turn for the worse, I'd give this game a 8-9/10 depending on how the story ends up.			"

Most of them are pretty easy but there are a couple that really require some time and attention to get. Well worth getting if you’re looking for a nostalgia trip with a new challenge. It may make you realise just how awful most of the spin offs really were though, if you hadn't already.			"

												This was at least my 4th time playing through this game. First time playing any PC version of it. Fixes in the dialogue were made. I appreciated the bug fix for magic defense added from armor. The better graphic mode was neat, but I preferred the original mode. Don't really know why the bad midi soundtrack was ever a thing on these PC versions. Immediately replaced those files.This port is almost completely true to the original PlayStation version. There are some issues that I have begun to identify from these recent playthroughs, but this is still a great game for the same reasons I enjoyed it years ago.Edit: Had to confirm that you do get the proper music files now. You don't have to worry about downloading and replacing any game files.			"

												What can I say? It's one of the most popular RPGs ever created. This port is actually a very good one. I had trouble logging in at first, but with following the simple directions given to me, I was able to go into my SE account and link my Steam account. Haven't had trouble since. So to anyone giving this game a Not Recommended review over something they can easily ""fix"" is beyond me.This game is great. It's got a little upgraded graphics, runs in what seems to be 60fps, and the sound quality is as good as the original. The nostalgia is real.Get hyped for the remake.			"

												For those wanting the nostalgia of a game that pre-dates the insane graphics we have now, but is on par with amazing storytelling and character development, this game is a winner. It may not have the looks or sound, but it more than makes up for that with the diversity of what can be done, where to go, and the overall enjoyment of the most mundane tasks. Filled with plot twists and comical suggestions, this game still stands on its own to this day, 16 years later.			"

												Nostalgia all over again...One of the most epic and well-known parts of the Final Fantasy series, a true masterpiece. This game may not be up to date and it certainly cannot beat what games nowadays can offer you but it is an important piece of gaming history. Something for old and new gamers. For new players it is recommended to go into this game without any expectations in order to fully understand the story and let yourself get sucked into it. For veteran players, well... you know why the money you've spent is worth every cent and with the Steam achievements you can at the same time reward yourself for your hard work.My advice:Buy the game if- you want to play one of the most influential games from the Playstation 1- love RPG games- love dramatic storylines- just want to try something fun- you are a Final Fantasy fan- want to relive your childhood memoriesI've played this game 7 years ago and I'm really happy that I was able to get a hold of it again. The graphics are slightly better than back on the Playstation 1. Even tho it might look the same, it has a slightly better resolution. "

You can easily get 60+ hours out of this game while just completing the story mode. So anyway like I said before get this game! And one more thing the MUSIC HAS BEEN FIXED, now all we need is Work Shop! Steam, Sqaure we all know that you can do that! SO DO IT!			"

												As a kid, when i was 7 years old, I went to a pc shop with my dad and he told me, that i could choose one game and he'd buy it to me... I saw a game outcast - you know,an epic game for that time... the problem was that outcast needed some additional drivers in order to run and as a kid I did not know nothing about drivers. Because i was just a kid and even though he already bought me outcast, we went back to the store and the salesman told me, that i can exchange a game with another one, so when i looked up, I saw it on a shelf - ""Cloud, holding this massive sword (buster sword) behind his back"". I've told dad: ""Dad, that's the game that i want"", he ""obeyed"" me and we took it home.Came home, sat down and installed the game - started it and the arrow keys weren't working - as a kid I knew how to use only arrow keys and i didn't even try to bother with other ones, so i tought the game was broken - and god bless my ignorance, i think that a couple of days have passed when i've figured out the controls - numpad.When I've started the game, (since i'm not from America nor Britain) I had poor knowledge of english - I got terrified how many dialogs were popping out and got really depressed when i didn't understand most of the written words -  ""That's it, i've decided to delete the game"".2 years have passed, I turned 9, other games and cartoon network were teaching me english at that time, so i've decided to give FFVII another go... and that's when it happened... I couldn't stop playing FFVII for 2 years. I found the story so interesting, even if there were words that i didn't understand, I had a dictionary besides me and the game helped me to learn english (the funny thing was, that i've pronounciated words differently, since i've never heard the words before). My short story and conclusion to this game is, that sometimes you just have to wait for the right time and that you must never give up :)﻿ALSO - my trip down the memory lane:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXUEErlWBgiMQxL0NCP3SvqyqWSHHx6Rr "

												Final Fantasy VII is universally recognized as the best installment of the series, and maybe one of the best RPG ever. I played the original, on the PS1, all the way through at least four or five times. FF7 was the only game I liked enough to get me to shell out the extra 20 bucks for the guide, just so I could find and/or beat every little side quest or hidden area. It absorbed many countless hours of my youth.Not to long ago, I found FF7 on Steam and quickly bought it for second time. Now I never did find my old guide (not that you need it with the internet), but I played Final Fantasy VII once again and loved every minute of it. I was reminded of it’s great story and characters, awesome weapons with unique leveling up, the way powers can be mixed together, and the great interface for both battle and world map. I enjoy that you can spend hours racing giant birds around for an awesome hidden item or fighting through a tough dungeon for a unique weapon. But the game doesn’t make you, very little of the required gameplay is grinding. This game does not require continuous, fast button mashing. So if you like to take frequent, short breaks from the game controller to enhance your video gaming experience, Final Fantasy VII is great for that.After completing this game once again, even though it took a bit longer because of that pesky thing known as a job, I still find it to be my favorite game ever. It has everything that made it great on the PS1, but the PC version is much smoother because of the updated hardware. If are a fan of the original, have played others in the series, or just enjoy RPGs or good games, it will be more than worth it to buy FF7, a great game all around.			"

												Very nice game, always wanted to play and own it. The DRM however is stupid, its so terribly unfriendly to the consumer. You won't beat piracy if you make the bought copy more difficult to run then the pirated version. This DRM says I cant play it on holiday because I have no internet connection, with the ROM PSX version you can. How do you expect me to recommend my friend the paid version over the PSX ROM? The PSX ROM is just flat out better because it does not have DRM.			"

Posted: April 11, 2015
												Well, I guess now's a good time to write a review.Final Fantasy VII (FFVII) is a very special game. A lore-filled world that's been expanded on for years after its release, Gaia (""The Planet"") is the setting of FFVII. Deserts, secret islands, ancient ruins, glaciers, mountains, a cyberpunk city, and even the bottom of the sea are all open to you as you hunt for a man seeking to destroy The Planet.You probably already knew all of this, so I won't bore you with story. Square sunk over 30 million dollars into this game, and that was back in 1997. The visuals show age, however. FFVII was meant to be played on a CRT television, which blended the screen together a bit. It's hard to explain, but the pixelation of the pre-rendered backgrounds is readily apparent and contrasts against the sharp, crisp polygons that make up the denizens of The Planet.The keyboard controls are pretty sensitive as well. Often I would find myself skipping over commands in battle on accident, so I switched to using a controller. DO NOT PLAY WITHOUT ONE. Speaking of battles, the encounter rate is very reasonable throughout the whole game, and as long as you don't run from too many enemies, you should never have to do any level grinding whatsoever.That goes for abilities as well. Want to use someone else? FFVII's skills take the form of items that characters equip, meaning they can be switched freely and removing the need to level up the Fire spell for all nine playable characters.There's a ton to do besides fight and progress in the story. Snowboarding, submarine battles, Chocobo racing and breeding, and a plethora of hidden treasures are all waiting for you, along with many other distractions. It's easy to sink a good 50-60 hours into the game.The music is my favorite soundtrack in the series. Some love it, some hate it. I don't have much else to say on that.Final Fantasy VII is a game many call ""overrated"". I personally couldn't agree less. It's a fun, creative, and engrossing adventure, and all of the hype you've heard is, for the most part, completely true. While I still think Final Fantasy VI is the best title in the series, VII is an incredibly close second. If you've never played this masterpiece before, do it now.			"

												FFVII, together with Mario and DK, was the start of all gaming for me and the memories of those days playing through it for the first time remain vivid. I love most of the other FF games as well, but VII will always be my genesis. We all know the remake is on the way, and I can't wait, that's for sure. But to those that've never played it, I do recommend taking the original out for a spin, 'cause it still got class. The outdated graphics and peculiar bugs are an acquired taste, but lovable in their own right.My only qualm is that there's no Japanese language option, and unless your computer is located in Japan the Square Enix online store doesn't allow you to purchase the Japanese PC version...

												If you're looking at the reviews for this you're either A.) Never played this game and looking to see what it is about...or B.) Played it and are looking to see how Steam does it.If you're an ""A"" -- don't worry this game has an amazing story, and in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest RPG's ever made.  Go ahead and spend the MASSIVE $11 (I paid $40 for it retail the day it came out for the good ole PlayStation!)  The review for you ""B"" guys is below.Despite some personal technical difficulties with saves and re-downloading this is for the most part much improved over the original version.  I'm not 100% on this but I feel like the dialogue got cleaned up a lot, it just flows more like native English and less like a half-decent Japanese translation to English.  The only downside to me is that it doesn't seem to use the PS style of controller I wanted to use for playing it -- at least it doesn't let me use it very well.  However, it is perfectly fine for the mouse and keyboard.			"

												Ahhhh FF7, the cornerstone of my rpg exposure from days past. It's good to see this particular title make it to Steam (honestly I was starting to think I was the only kid that had it for his PC back in the day). I remember growing up playing on my old win 95 pc, juggling between 7 disks contorting my fingers to use the numpad controles. But I'm not here to bore you with my nostalgic bantering lets go over the good the bad and the ugly.The good: This is a pretty basic jrpg thats real easy to pick up and understand. If you never played an rpg before this would be a good well-rounded game to break into. As far as game-play mechanics go, it's got a very gentle learning curve where if you take a moment or two to read some material explained on some of the games finer points and tool around with some of the settings (like ATB if you're new or want a purely turn-based combat style) IMHO, if not personal opinion, the magic and skill materia system is just more easily managable than previous/alternative character-class styles or the ill-recieved drawing/job-skill system of other games in the franchise.The bad:Looking at the story and analyzing it a little bit closer since growing up I've started to notices the flaws I didn't notice before. True it tickles my nostalgic core to no end playing this game and the characters and story is going to be something that sticks with me forever but looking closer and taking an outside perspective it's impossible to overlook some of the major story flaws. Plot points will be brought up that lead nowhere (or if you're a Square-enix executive, you'll just write whole new games around these points to cash-in on the fanbase). Yet one of the things that killed me playing this game again was the blatant continuity errors. Characters will mention or prod the player in a direction that they really wouldn't know about in the first place. Compared to other RPGs it's these flaws that I think may have made this and other similar games too watered down to appeal to a larger base audience like say the kind that don't like investigating, talking to every npc, or just simply spending the time to make an attempt at trial-and-error. Now, this doesn't break the game mind you. It's just try not to expect wracking your brain too much with this casual game.The ugly:Keyboard controls.... nuff said. Pick yourself up a xbox controller or logitech if you're cheap but do yourself the favor.Story: 7/10Controls: 4/10Nostalgia-boner: 9999/10			"

												Memories... This game evokes many. I first played Final Fantasy VII in 1998 since I was late to the PSX party; it was the entire reason I made it a point to purchase a Playstation in the first place. I had just turned 15 and had the entire summer ahead of me. This was probably my tenth playthrough of FFVII and the first time I've touched the game since 2004.I was excited to sit through the intro as Midgar slowly comes into view again and we gradually see the full expanse of the mako megapolis in all of its glory, spouting geysers of planet energy into the air miles above the upper plate. Seeing Aerith's face slowly appear on my screen reminded me of an angsty, heartbroken 15 year old version of myself that could never forgive the game developers for doing what they did, even though what they did is probably what cemented this game in my mind as one of the all-time greats. They got me emotionally invested, which probably isn't very hard to do with a 15 year old - let's be real. There are critics everywhere and I respect their opinions on why FFVII is flawed - but I'm here to share why I think it's great and has withstood the test of time.Let's start out with the setting. Inconsistent? Maybe a little. Fun and interesting? Absolutely. Midgar (especially at the time of the game's release) was unlike anything ever seen in a video game before. It was dark, gritty and full of danger. Your capital city isn't supposed to be crawling with monsters and infested by extremely unsavory folk at every turn. I mean EVERY turn. We aren't talking your staple renegade rogues and bandits, either. We're talking a group of eco-terrorists, a brothel with all kinds of sexual deviants, and a Kingpin pimp with the rule over the most lustrious town in the slums. Not to mention you have ShinRa's hitman shadowing you in the very early stages of the game: Reno. Most of this was unheard of in video games, especially a game that garnered as much attention as Final Fantasy VII did and still does. Clearly, there was a good formula at the start.Leaving Midgar, you begin traveling to other towns which are typically much smaller and far less populated as well as more peaceful... if they haven't been ravaged by ShinRa, Inc. Some favorite locations for me personally, in no particular order include:Fort Condor -- It's small and there's hardly anything going on there. Two people to talk to, but this place first gave me the initial sense of desperation people feel towards ShinRa (outside of AVALANCHE and some other Midgar residents) as they fight to protect the near-extinct Condors, one of which happens to be nesting atop the Mako Reactor built there.Costa del Sol -- Swing by and have a Tropical Nights at the bar! Costa del Sol was the first town in Final Fantasy VII I felt like I could relax in (the short run-in with Hojo aside). Finally I seemed to be out of ShinRa's grasp for a little bit and had some chill time. The music and ambience of this town is the first like it I really got to experience in such detail; it felt like a fun, albeit short, reprieve for the crew. Everyone split up and gave you the opportunity to have brief dialogue with each member of your party.Nibelheim -- One of the creepiest towns outside of Silent Hill. You walk into Nibelheim and you automatically know something's wrong (outside of it just being there alone since it should be ash). The townsfolk are all obviously hiding something and just simply either chuckle at you or demand that you leave. Nibel Mansion is one of the most unsettling places around, although I think they could've done better with enemy choices for this location to expand upon that, the music is chilling as you venture deeper and deeper into the mansion to try and uncover the mysteries it hides.Wutai -- It's like Beijing and Kyoto got mashed together hundreds of years ago with pretty awesome results. Wutai is one of the biggest locations you can visit outside of Midgar and even has a large mountain - Da Chao - in which you can participate in a sidequest to rid yourself of a slimy pimp and settle an old score once and for all. The Pagoda is my favorite. Influenced by Bruce Lee's 'Game of Death' there are five floors for the spunky young ninja Yuffie to fight her way up in 1 on 1 combat before meeting the Grandmaster in a deadly fight for supremacy, and pretty good rewards.I like most locations in FFVII and could keep talking about them for awhile, but let's skip all that. Next, I want to talk about some COMBAT.FFVII sports the ATB System which allows you to increase or decrease the speed of battle at your leisure - personally, I have to go full throttle in games like this, but to each their own. Materia is engaging but not so comlex that it will make you walk away scratching your head in frustration. It's fun to level up and see new spells get unlocked as well as find new Materia. My major gripe with Materia is that the stat adjustments (some would give you -02% HP, for example), were pretty inconsequential; especially with the introduction of HP / MP Plus Materia. I like the cause and effect game and trying to work through it more.  There are several different Materia types which I'll break down here:Magic (Green) Materia: Magic Materia covers all of the elements such as Fire, Lightning and Ice. There are a number of others as well. You start off with Fire, Bolt and Ice as the basic spells of these Materia and as you win battles, your Materia basically gains experience as well and will eventually evolve to its next stage and unlock a higher tiered spell for most. This was very interesting as in other games it just seemed to be either done at a random level some character would learn a new spell for the most part - FFIII for SNES being one of the exceptions also.Summon (Red) Materia: Ever feel like calling forth a primordial beast from the depths of the netherworld to wreak havoc upon your enemies? Yeah? Well, you should probably get mental help. Summons are bad♥♥♥♥♥incarnations that are... summoned, and do heavy damage to all enemies. Most of these guys are elemental based as well and they range from an Ice Queen to the Lord of the Underworld all the way up to a mecha-Godzilla looking Dragon that blasts your enemies from outer space with the force of a nuclear bomb. I can dig it.Command (Yellow) Materia: This Materia is very versatile in that it enhances a character's actions or unlocks new actions for the character utilizing the materia. For example, throw Double-Cut on Tifa and she will attack twice in a row with a physical attack instead of the normal one time. Sense Materia allows you to view the HP/Status of an enemy at any time when used, and you can even use your Gil as a weapon to hurl at your opponents - the more you throw, the more damage is done.Support (Blue) Materia: Also very useful, allowing you to cast basic single targetting spells on all enemies and even allowing you to Steal when you perform a certain attack that you have the Materia linked with.Independent (Pink) Materia: Covering your allies is always useful if you have someone who can take a lot of punishment. Some of this Materia is good and useful early in the game - later on, it feels pretty broken though. I would've liked to have done without.I did get Materia Master on this playthrough and it was very gratifying for me, personally. Though I will warn you, it is time consuming and there are a few Materia that you can miss and if you do: you will not get the achievement on that playthrough.Combat is fast and exciting for awhile and if you're a gaming masochist like me, the Battle Arena at Gold Saucer can be really fun, especially if you go there at lower levels. Some of the Materia combos just make this game busted at higher levels. I think Ruby and Emerald Weapons (the super bosses of this game) each got two to three hits on me before I annhilated them. Out of room here. Part II will come later. Thanks			"

												There's really not much I can say about Final Fantasy 7 that hasn't already been said. It was a revolutionary game and it changed the face of RPGs forever. Some say it was for the best, others disagree.In any case you've likely heard all the JRPG stereotypes, the random battles, and the menu based combat. The storyline is extremely character driven, and it's one of the highlights of the entire experience. That's not counting the large world you explore, the sidequests and all the optional content. Much of which most players don't know about until they read a wiki. Final Fantasy 7 is a game about replayability and choices, and one that anyone can enjoy.			"

												For those wanting the nostalgia of a game that pre-dates the insane graphics we have now, but is on par with amazing storytelling and character development, this game is a winner. It may not have the looks or sound, but it more than makes up for that with the diversity of what can be done, where to go, and the overall enjoyment of the most mundane tasks. Filled with plot twists and comical suggestions, this game still stands on its own to this day, 16 years later.			"

												Wish this were a title with cards.FFVII wallpapers and emoticons would be great.Always been a fan of this game.  You have to play it at least twice to take it all in, I have gone through maybe 50 or 60 times on PSX, I bought this because my system wasn't loading the discs anymore.Now I can have it on pretty much any computer.  It requires so little to play :DIf you haven't played this yet, FF 3-8 are really the meat of the series.  Get these here on Steam, and the others over on mobile, the 3D remakes of the older FF titles are really good, I have the DS versions.I gave up on alot of games by Squeenix, but this game can stand the test of time.  I would have preferred an HD remastered edition to a rerelease of the exact PC and PSX game I already owned.  It is about high time Square gave the fans better things.I am still waiting for a sequel or remastering of Secret of Evermore.			"

												 although this is the only final fantasy game I have played its amazing and such a classic. the graphics are a bit dated but the cutscenes still look good, the storyline is great and can be really emotional, the gameplay is fantastic as it goes through a realistic turn based gameplay where enemies still attack u even on ur turn when trying to make a choice however this might not go well with people who are not fans of the rpg genre but its still good gameplay any final fantasy fan who hasent played this one yet (which could be unlikely) MUST play this game! I am really glad that Square Enix re released this classic game for the pc so I defenitly reccomend this game if you liked the final fantasy 13 series on xbox 360 and ps3 just try and make sure u dont have onions next to u while watching some of the emotional bits in the game!

												A great classic JRPG. When this game first came out back in the days, the graphics were the most amazing thing to look at. From the Kinghts of the Round, Omnislash and many other magics, I remember enjoying watching all those in my play.  But just because the game has a lower graphic compared to today's games, does not mean FF7 is going to be a bad game now. It still has a great storyline that revolves around Cloud and friends, while having awesome materia mechanics in battles. I actually used many different combinations this time and the game felt totally different. :) So what's to hesitate? Go into the world of Final Fantasy VII that once rocked the world and save the planet from Sephiroth!			"

This DRM says I cant play it on holiday because I have no internet connection, with the ROM PSX version you can. How do you expect me to recommend my friend the paid version over the PSX ROM?

												Final Fantasy VII is a special game, there basically none like it.Not for its history but there are not as much potential games being made like it, not enough games with its ambition or originality. It transcends all of what is expected and surpasses all basically. This game is not overrated or neutral in my book, in fact it is indeed considered underrated now for me, it’s been a while since people experience it’s raw power but it is still is to this day one of the best games ever made. . Of course the stands of its title as the best game ever made are still pretty known yet dismissed which is very sad because this is an overachiever of an experience ESPECIALLY compared with the rest of its series and many of the genres.  It’s faster than what its series is normally is; its gameplay is simpler and funnier, having personally one of the best mechanics ever, the materia. Especially considering this is one of the best games I’ve played I recommend it to anyone really. It’s just a nice smooth experience even if you aren’t the type to play big games to the end; I really recommend this, even I someone who cannot support this type of length it is still a game that every second manages to show me something cool. It is basically my saving grace on long JRPGs and perhaps video games in general. The gameplay is one of the most mechanically best I’ve seen, simple and straight to the point unlike many other games that take a long time to get to the basic of it, this one gives you it all at full front and doesn’t hesitate to make it entertaining at all times. Magic is simple to use by any character using the materia system which is the best system ever, they’re these little magic pearls that once equipped within your weapon can be used, they can also be combined with slots that are combined slots which you can make combos with such as (A “Cure” materia with an “All” materia makes it possible to use that magic on all). On top of this the materia can be leveled up as you battle to be more efficient by gaining , not only this, all characters within the game are extremely useful even without the power to equip any materia you wish from battle power to healing! Every character has a Limit Break which is when they get hit a couple of times and can’t take it anymore, they will release a power blow that is mostly based on their characteristic, for example Tifa Lockhart will use wrestling moves done by a roulette a system, and Aeris’s first limit will be to give some health to the 3 of your team. The entire game’s backgrounds are made with these amazingly animated CGI pictures that are filled with detail and are always cool to look at, it has beaten any texture or tile pack in its genre of how memorable and incredible it’s visuals are. Not only that but a fair share of interactive cutscenes blending in with the game’s models, an insane amount of in-battle animations with over a thousand enemies with their unique attack patterns and styles and in general lots of effort put into to the limit. I used to dislike this game due to my short attention span I grew to notice how much it has to offer especially compared to others of the genre; it has indeed a wider variation of options while remaining simple and straight to the point, from dialog, to character selection, to how many weapons and powers you can acquire, different styles to take on an enemy entirely there are various choices to do on side missions side too and you can collect rare items as you explore a giant world, collect more, experiment with powers, there are multiple statues that are negative and positive, a round of elemental powers given to about anything in the game including actual weapons you receive, accessories that facilitate you by nullifying certain types of times and just a huge number of other statistics that yes while describing seems complex but seems very natural and simple within the game, all this to discover new ways to make gameplay easier and this is all done in a balanced manner quickly.. It’s a bit long to go into detail about each content you can go to but as an example there’s a materia that allows you to turn enemies into items. The plot is amazingly crafted and designed; it is filled with foreshadowing, flashbacks and not an adventure that manages to keep continuing without any breaks and always a bigger goal in front.  Out though yes everything within the game is almost as If a satire of how simple it is, mostly everything is based of clichés and yes it’s mostly comical and never 100% reassured (I mean c,mon by this point you would tell yourself “Oh I guess the magic goop heals all of the plot’s wounds” to be honest or “Must be symbolic” because really It’s a just science fantasy with a more serious turn), but that only comes within the standards of nitpicking, I mean honestly, if you were to go to the single first bone of this game realistically you would think to yourself “Isn’t ecoterrorism flawed?”, but don’t worry they later on in the game kind of regrets what he did to save the planet SO HEY Plot filling exists at a high level in this game, this game can truly sustain itself in terms of plot elements sometimes even if it’s silly so I’ll end it at that considering there’s many other silly major plot concentrations that can be easily taken away in a bad way if you don’t see it from the adventurous perspective or ATLEAST EXPLORE THEM!  What’s there is there, it’s a simple story within a typical cyberpunk sceneario and I’m more than ok with that, other than that the implied adult themes are strong… And the adult themes that are straight up shown are STRONG TOO! This game is still pretty grimdark to this day, it was the first of the series to introduce real issues such as poverty, world pollution, life goals, what death means to a person and how to live with it amongst other deep contents in which the game casually comments on with a quote or 2, perhaps even an entire character built on the topic. Some may complain on how it tries to deep but for me it’s more the merrier, it isn’t the best psychological take on characters but it certainly isn’t the worst, especially compared with what Japanese media takes as “Psychological” it could BE WAY worse.  Either way I appreciate it’s psychological tones it gives the plot way much depth and it doesn’t deliver itself at first glance, anyone against it must REALLY hate people with actual personalities that are basically perfect cardboard main characters, again it’s balanced because the characters themselves are competent, which is needlessly to say the necessary for a character, outside of that you can have your emotional problems as long as you use it to power yourself within your journey, I give this long speech about character development because IT SEEMS This HAS BEEN DONE WRONG MANY TIMES and Final Fantasy VII manages to do it alright. This is THE adventure, the most over achieving product in history, this game manages to hold my attention in all of the aspects it gives, a great and full of effort game that has grown out to be known as the best game ever made numerous times, it comes with a dark well designed plot filled with numerous great characters, it’s silly, humorous  and memorable,  it’s filled to the brim with content which is all amazingly crafted (which honestly is the reason why I fear this review might be TOO basic to cover up the entire game), there are 4 hour long documentaries which document every aspect, nook and cranny from this full of experience game. I mean it doesn’t seem much like it but I’m actually trying to refrain myself from writing more than a book here considering there is so much to comment on! This is my Final Fantasy. Also not full revie			"

-Quick Review-Final Fantasy VII (FF7) is a turn-based RPG that was released in 1997 on the Play Station Console by Square Co., Ltd (in 2003 they merged with Enix, creating ""Square Enix""). Final Fantasy VII (FFV) is one of the most popular games in the series.-please note before purchase-I need to add a comment that, I tend to review the game alone, however for Final Fantasy VII you are required to creature (or use an existing) Square Enix account. Achievements/Steam-Achievements, and other features are accessible through that account... I don't really know many of the perks because I just jumped through the hoops to play the game. But to some people, that's a deal breaker.I just wanted to give people a heads up. Thank you for reading the rest of the review.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You play the game as the main protagonist ""Cloud"", whom is probably tied for being the most iconic figure in the series with the antagonist ""Sephiroth"". You start the game as a member of the terrorist group AVALANCHE, Cloud has just been hired and is providing combat assistance to the group... Good thing too, the raid doesn't go nearly as planned.As the story progresses you're limited to only to the city of ""Midgar"", after hitting the pinnacle of the story within Midgar (oh, you'll know what I'm talking about, if you make it that far. I was praying for a save point, I wanted to go to bed). You'll suddenly discover the world is a much larger place then you ever thought.To people who are new to the series, it's easy to brush it off as ""oh, that's nice, a large world map *yawn*."" Try to imagine seeing it as a little kid playing the PlayStation? To many of my friends this was the first game in the genre they had played, so naturally it's actually a very memorable experience. After this excellent transition, you realize ""wow, this game is going to be a big long one"" and it is, it came in 3 disk set.Game Play: I needed to do some research to refresh some of the terms used to describe the Final Fantasy VII combat system. I have played several Turn-based RPG's, however FF7 utilizes ""Active Time Battle"". The main difference is that there's a visible timer that counts down before you can make your next move.I had no idea that's how the game worked, so when I first played and my enemy had hit me three times while I was trying to learn the menu... well... needless to say I was more than a little surprised. ""WHAT! You cheaters! I don't know what any of these moves do!"" I have no shame in admitting I almost lost my first battle, and I lost my first boss battle in the first 20 minutes of the game. Yeah, go ahead and laugh at me; but this was my first time encountering that mechanic.Outside of the combat, there are many in-game events that you do throughout FF7, sometimes it's pressing key sequences to ride a snowboard, or chocobo, or arm wrestle. While very fun with a controller and on the original game console... with a keyboard and mouse the controls and tutorial still use the old button names. So there's extra difficulty trying to accomplish those. I end up failing MOST mini events because I don't know which button I'm pressing.""Press select"" mmmmk, letssseee... which one is select... *presses X* *Cloud face plants*. Well that was fun, let's try that again...Achievements: There are 36 Achievements for Final Fantasy VII, and four categories; 1) Person joins your party, 2) you do your first breaker limit with that character, 3) you do your last breaker limit with that character, 4) Some ridicules long end game achievement.I've played 26 hours so far (05/14/15) and only have 10/36 achievements, so naturally getting all the steam achievements will be quite an accomplishment in this game.Price: Final Fantasy VII is priced at $11.99, considering the amount of time you'll spend playing FF7 to get through the whole story alone, that's a very fair price. However, if you're just collecting games to your ""maybe I'll play it someday"" list, you should probably wait for a steam sale.Conclusion: The only real negative things I have to say about the game is that I don't like making accounts to log into an offline-game (but that's just the way it is), and using a keyboard isn't nearly as streamlined and seamless as using a controller.I personally love the story, the characters, and will be spending more time playing the game, I suspect I've just moved on to disk 2, So I've still got a lot farther to go before I beat the game... Then there's the whole thing about figuring out the achievements.I recommend this game to anyone who played the original game and wishes for some nostalgia, people who want to experience ""Active Time Battle"" game play in an RPG, or anyone casually interested in the story behind any of the characters in the FF7 world.

												I remember playing this when I was around 9 or 10. I played it a good while and picked it up much later and started over. I've never actually completed it but it is marvelous. One of the best games I've ever played. Now, I've heard the port isn't so great but there are some good mods out there to restore it such as the improved PSX music and a more modern graphical update. Definitely worth it.			"

												This was my very first Final Fantasy game and still one of my favorites in the series and of my greatest childhood memories, i loved this game back then and i still do today, but i will say that it is not the best Final Fantasy game and it is by far the most overrated one in the franchise.The materia system without a doubt my favorite thing about this game and is my favorite ""leveling"" system of all the Final Fantasy Games.The music is great just like most of Nobuo Uematsu's work, one of my favorite things about this game.The steam version also includes the PS1 soundtrack the original PC version didn't have :D (From what i'v heard it wasn't included at first when the game launched on steam until a few months later which is a lazy move on Square's part)! One of Nobuo's best works alongside Final Fantasy VIII.The story is not the game's strongest part but its far from bad.Most of the characters are pretty good though but not best in the series.The graphics may look silly by todays standards but back when it first came out i found them really impressive.However the minigames in this game are definently the worst part of this game, the chocobo racing is decent, raising them however is time consuming but still kinda fun, the Bike Race is fun too but aside from that none of the other minigames are fun or intresting.Also this might be somewhat of a nitpick but i think the Steam achievements are just made up with no effort at all, boring as ♥♥♥♥ and not intresting at all, oh wellFinal Verdict 8.8/10 if you are a Final Fantasy fan and you haven't played it yet i'd say its worth your time, and for those who havent gotten into the series its a decent game to start with.

												In my opinion, one of the best stories ever told by an RPG.  I can remember all of the highs, the lows, and realizations I had when I first played this game back in 1997 (or so).  The PC port does not improve on graphics a ton, but the gameplay is pretty smooth and it does have an option to max out hp/mp/gil through a cloud save system if you don't feel like grinding.  Overall I would recommend getting this game, especially if you have never played it before and enjoy RPGs, or if you (like me) no longer have anyway to play the PSX version.			"

												I see little point in discussing this game's content because by now it's probably common knowledge. So what's the deal with this release?Well it's on PC, Steam, has cloud saving, a booster thing that makes the game easier, and achievements that made me play this game much more than I otherwise would have (I'm crazy, ok?). It also has a piece of DRM that i've heard is a real nuisance for some, but I didn't have too much trouble with it. You have to make an account, but once I linked it with my Steam account I never had to worry about it again. The real problem is the instability of their server, which takes down cloud saves during busy hours (during the sale it did, but not after that was done with). It does save locally though, and it updates your cloud save once that gets going again, so it's not really a big deal. Nevertheless, I felt the need to mention all this.Aside from that, this is FF7 as it was on the PS1 ~15 years ago (I still have a [friend's] copy :o). Everything. The story, gameplay, optional content, and even some glitches (W-Item) carry over to this version.That's really all I need to say, I think. Chances are you already know if you like this game or not. And if you never played it... well, you can if you want to. I had a decent time, but people tend to love or hate this game. Less because of what it is and more because of what it did: became a ""standard"" for JRPG's that has more or less remained the same ever since, for better or worse.Ok, i'll stop now. Buy if it interests you. You get what you expect: an aged PS1 classic that plays competently on the PC and has a few nice little additions.			"

												This is now the definitive version of the game now that they added PSX music. The translation and graphics are superior to the PSX version and it's most likely going to be cheaper than actually purchasing a physical copy. As for the game itself, the flaws are all still there and have become as glaring as ever with its age. The story still is as nonsensical as ever, the super deformed characters still look ugly, and the materia system actually destroys the traditional RPG formula for balance and makes each character essentially blank canvases outside of their base stats and limit breaks. That can be fun at first glance but it becomes very bland when every character essentially operates the same way and the end game becomes so single-minded. It's also a turn based/random encounter affair so if those kind of games get on your nerves you should avoid this at all costs. Lastly, the characters are your standard JRPG affair (although at the time, these archetypes in video games weren't common in North America) and most don't really evolve past their initial character development, especially outside of the party. The good?-The materia system is fun, flexible, and broken. I can't say I agree with it on a balancing or variety level but on the surface it's fun and gratifying.-The story ends up being paced pretty well throughout the entire journey which doesn't happen very often with JRPGs. -Random encounters are paced very well for a JRPG and I didn't find myself ripping my hair out until the final dungeon (two battles every screen with a mastered Enemy Away? Nah). -There are many side-quests that feel naturally implemented into the world and I enjoyed most of them aside from Chocobo breeding which was nothing but tedious.-The pre-rendered backgrounds are also usually pleasing to the eye (then again, they're a stark contrast to the awful character models that populate them). -The music and sound effects are great and overall the presentation has a charm to it that most JRPGs don't. My personal outlook on the game may have soured a bit over time but the core of the game holds up fairly well to this day despite some obvious flaws. I rate it overall a very strong 7. A worthwhile experience that I think gamers insterested in the history of the medium should attempt to tackle, especially those who are familiar with Japanese RPGs.			"

												If you're looking at the reviews for this you're either A.) Never played this game and looking to see what it is about...or B.) Played it and are looking to see how Steam does it.If you're an ""A"" -- don't worry this game has an amazing story, and in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest RPG's ever made.  Go ahead and spend the MASSIVE $11 (I paid $40 for it retail the day it came out for the good ole PlayStation!)  The review for you ""B"" guys is below.Despite some personal technical difficulties with saves and re-downloading this is for the most part much improved over the original version.  I'm not 100% on this but I feel like the dialogue got cleaned up a lot, it just flows more like native English and less like a half-decent Japanese translation to English.  The only downside to me is that it doesn't seem to use the PS style of controller I wanted to use for playing it -- at least it doesn't let me use it very well.  However, it is perfectly fine for the mouse and keyboard.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is universally recognized as the best installment of the series, and maybe one of the best RPG ever. I played the original, on the PS1, all the way through at least four or five times. FF7 was the only game I liked enough to get me to shell out the extra 20 bucks for the guide, just so I could find and/or beat every little side quest or hidden area. It absorbed many countless hours of my youth.Not to long ago, I found FF7 on Steam and quickly bought it for second time. Now I never did find my old guide (not that you need it with the internet), but I played Final Fantasy VII once again and loved every minute of it. I was reminded of it’s great story and characters, awesome weapons with unique leveling up, the way powers can be mixed together, and the great interface for both battle and world map. I enjoy that you can spend hours racing giant birds around for an awesome hidden item or fighting through a tough dungeon for a unique weapon. But the game doesn’t make you, very little of the required gameplay is grinding. This game does not require continuous, fast button mashing. So if you like to take frequent, short breaks from the game controller to enhance your video gaming experience, Final Fantasy VII is great for that.After completing this game once again, even though it took a bit longer because of that pesky thing known as a job, I still find it to be my favorite game ever. It has everything that made it great on the PS1, but the PC version is much smoother because of the updated hardware. If are a fan of the original, have played others in the series, or just enjoy RPGs or good games, it will be more than worth it to buy FF7, a great game all around.			"

My personal outlook on the game may have soured a bit over time but the core of the game holds up fairly well to this day despite some obvious flaws. I rate it overall a very strong 7. A worthwhile experience that I think gamers insterested in the history of the medium should attempt to tackle, especially those who are familiar with Japanese RPGs.			"

												This one would be the classic, yeah there are some flaws and Square hasnt helped with thier new login system, but for someone like myself who spent days or weeks in the past surfing the web for patchs and fixes just to get it to run, it doesnt bother me, it works and thats enough.The story is rich, the music is great brings those memories flooding back, if you started FF later in the series then you need to try it, there is just so much content, its open world, big bosses roaming the place, its great! It is such a iconic game, one way or the other for the old memories or the curiousity you need to play it. "

												Well, I guess now's a good time to write a review.Final Fantasy VII (FFVII) is a very special game. A lore-filled world that's been expanded on for years after its release, Gaia (""The Planet"") is the setting of FFVII. Deserts, secret islands, ancient ruins, glaciers, mountains, a cyberpunk city, and even the bottom of the sea are all open to you as you hunt for a man seeking to destroy The Planet.You probably already knew all of this, so I won't bore you with story. Square sunk over 30 million dollars into this game, and that was back in 1997. The visuals show age, however. FFVII was meant to be played on a CRT television, which blended the screen together a bit. It's hard to explain, but the pixelation of the pre-rendered backgrounds is readily apparent and contrasts against the sharp, crisp polygons that make up the denizens of The Planet.The keyboard controls are pretty sensitive as well. Often I would find myself skipping over commands in battle on accident, so I switched to using a controller. DO NOT PLAY WITHOUT ONE. Speaking of battles, the encounter rate is very reasonable throughout the whole game, and as long as you don't run from too many enemies, you should never have to do any level grinding whatsoever.That goes for abilities as well. Want to use someone else? FFVII's skills take the form of items that characters equip, meaning they can be switched freely and removing the need to level up the Fire spell for all nine playable characters.There's a ton to do besides fight and progress in the story. Snowboarding, submarine battles, Chocobo racing and breeding, and a plethora of hidden treasures are all waiting for you, along with many other distractions. It's easy to sink a good 50-60 hours into the game.The music is my favorite soundtrack in the series. Some love it, some hate it. I don't have much else to say on that.Final Fantasy VII is a game many call ""overrated"". I personally couldn't agree less. It's a fun, creative, and engrossing adventure, and all of the hype you've heard is, for the most part, completely true. While I still think Final Fantasy VI is the best title in the series, VII is an incredibly close second. If you've never played this masterpiece before, do it now.			"

												FFVII, together with Mario and DK, was the start of all gaming for me and the memories of those days playing through it for the first time remain vivid. I love most of the other FF games as well, but VII will always be my genesis. We all know the remake is on the way, and I can't wait, that's for sure. But to those that've never played it, I do recommend taking the original out for a spin, 'cause it still got class. The outdated graphics and peculiar bugs are an acquired taste, but lovable in their own right.My only qualm is that there's no Japanese language option, and unless your computer is located in Japan the Square Enix online store doesn't allow you to purchase the Japanese PC version...

												One of my all time favorite games I have ever played. The graphics now are outdated but that doesn't take away much from the game. In my opinion one of the best of all the Final Fntasy games. But don't expect this game to be easy on you; you will see the ""game over"" screen a few times (5 times for the Demons Gate battle for me...) and this game at times will not show you mercy and it will push you a bit. Haste, Regen, Cure and MBarrier will be your friends in battle, as will the All materia, so get these materias and begin using them to level them up to help you through the tougher battles.Though I highly suggest this game there are a few little things to be warned about, like the camera angle making moving around in some areas a bit tricky and annoying, and the button configuration for the game is still shown in game as buttons for a Play Station controller so some mini games that require specific buttons pressed become a little harder but not impossible.As you progress in game and level up your party, the nice thing is you don't have to worry too much about everyone who didn't fit in your limited party of 3; as you level up, they slowly level up as wel on their own. So if you get Cloud up to level 25, those who haven't been in your party in forever (for me this was Aries...) will often be around level 20, so close to the others in level. This is convenient because you don't always get to pick who tags along in your party.An added element to the game that was avaiable in the American release of Final Fantasy 7 are the WEAPON monsters. They are here in the Steam game and are typically a nightmare to fight so be prepared.			"

												Those of you who have played the FF Saga on Gameboy...yes..Gameboy :D that grey cubelike thing u could play 2d games on...known for Tetris and Mario... and enjoyed it will be happy about this jewel. FF7 meets all the criteria for a rly good rpg. The story is just fantastic, you can spend weeks on this game and the battlesystem is pretty sweet. Ofc you have to keep in mind that this is oooone oldschool game. I loved it when I was little and as soon as it was available on steam I thought Id give it another try and even though the graphics are 1990 style I (almost) enjoyed every minute (more or less).Unlike the rest of the FF series the story takes place in a rather machanical-the world-is-going-to-end atmosphere. So there will be no witches, no knights and no princesses (yaaaay!). As usual you and ur mates are up to save the world...this time from Sephiroth (you must all know who he is... otherwise u have a serious  lack of gamers knowledge...). To save the world from its nonexistance you have the power of some outta this world materia which allows u to cast spells. So if you think urself back in time 20 years you will think these spells are f**** mindblowing. Today in 2014 they are not quite that cool but still worth the time.Imo the batlesystem is much better than in the latest FF games. Its round based and if u speed it up in the menue you will spare urself precious time. What is really really annoying though is that u have to watch the endscene after every battle. Even if it just takes about 5 seconds it is rly annoying... But sometimes u have to go through hell to experience the best story ever seen in an RPG!There are plenty of youtube vids you can check and it may look rly boring in the beginning but this game is probably the most amazing of all the FF games. The second best is FF8 which we you can luckily also get on steam and the rest I didnt like and I am also not spending a second (or third or fourth) playthrough on... but this one I must have played...5 times... :D So thumbs up! Hope Squaresoft (Square Enix...) will let go of the princess and knights and medieval mixture soon and get back on track after.... uhm.... 14 years.So Frankly: Characters are great. Battlesystem is good. Dialogues can be a bit annoying and u have to rapidly click through them if your not interested into listening to everything. Story is the best. FF7 is the best RPG :D			"

												Okay, to write a review of Final Fantasy 7 is not a simple task, believe me it's not. Now you've probably heard this before from dozens of people, whether it be your friends, gaming magazines, internet or basically any other form of communication; written or spoken, Final Fantasy 7 is one of the best games of all time, and though now it may seem like an overrated, outdated RPG nearly 17 years later, it deserves the title.I only beat this game once, and have dived back into it thanks to this updated re-release on Steam. Visually, it's eye-candy to me. Though current-day gamers might turn thier heads, this game looks awesome and if it weren't for the PlayStation's graphical limits, i would say that this is the way the developers originally invisioned the game back in 1997, fluent animations, sharper character models, and just overall better looking port.The Story is something else, The story of Final Fantasy 7 is not a forgettable one. You begin as part of an eco-terrorist group who is hell-bent on destroying the world's biggest power company for killing the planet, hours into the game later you find yourself on a mission to save a world that is doomed to complete annihilation at the hands of a super-soldier who is ""taking back the planet"". (i hate to give away to much spoilers.)As for the gameplay it is your typical, run-of-the-mill, turn-based JRPG. for a series who practically invented the genre, this game doesn't stray to far away from it's predecessors in terms of the battle system and means of progression, hell if you're having trouble understanding how to play, there are countless websites dedicated to this game as well as an in-game tutorial, have fun.If you are a fan or RPG's, JRPG's, or curious about the genre, PLAY THIS. you are doing yourselfs a huge injustice by reading this and playing some damn Final Fantasy 7, you will not be dissapointed.

												I do recommend this game but it can be frustrating. Not from the level grinding or overall difficulty of it. The part that can be frustrating at times is when you can't tell whats a path and what isnt. When the exits and whatnot are a lot of times very vague about whether or not they are exits. Sometimes you go to the next screen and can't tell where the hell your character is so you try moving and turns out you went back through the way you just came from. It can drive you mad. But still gotta give this game what its due. 8/10			"

												I can't say anything that hasn't already been covered by everyone else. Look at all the positive reviews, then buy the game. If you love RPG's then you owe it to yourself to play this game at least once in your life. If you love YOURSELF you should buy this game.			"

												Overall, a good deal on sale and for RPG fans who haven't had a chance to play this classic, or who just want the convenience of having it on Steam. FF7 fans/vets won't really find anything new worthwhile and are probably better off replaying whatever version they already have. Personally I would recommend a version where you can save anytime and use a speed boost, but it is all up to your preference.+Outstanding gameplay, story, music, and characters just like you remember+Every RPG fan should own/play at least once+Supports variety of resolutions from launcher+Runs great with Win7 64+Achievements+Variety of mods available including ones to improve some graphics/bugs-Graphics aren't really a strong point, though of course good for the time-Widescreen resolutions work but just result in black bars on the sides-Some minor screen cutoff, usually not too noticeable-Few achievements, either very easy or very hard with no intermediate-Mods aren't really user-friendly to most casual players-Extra DRM: Requires sign-up and login to Square Enix account			"

												I can see nothing to complain about with FFVII. The story is excellent, the world is well thought, and the gameplay is solid. I believe that it has yet to be surpassed in the RPG genre since everything went 3D. There are those games where everything comes together to form an experience, this is one of those rare wonders.

												Final Fantasy VII was one of my first, if not THE experience with JRPG games. If you can overlook the outdated gameplay mechanics and graphics, then you're in for a  story full of interesting characters, exciting battles, funny and moving moments. Be sure to invest a lot of your free time in this one. But you won't regret it!Not convinced? It has chocobo racing and breeding, you know.			"

AUDIOClassicVISUALPolygonalDIFFICULTYToughVIBEClassic RPGCRAVINGJourneyON SALERarelyPROS:  Music has been changed back from MIDI form. Cloud-saving is kind of nice I suppose, since the game is so long (It can also be disabled.) Mistranslations and errors have been fixed. The game itself flows smoothly and is not prone to eye-sore jittering. I have not run into any crashing. FF7 itself is a great part of RPG history and worth a try.CONS: Logging in with Square is irritating and leads to issues if you aren't connected via internet. I'm not sure that level of invasiveness in the DRM is worth what benefits it gives you. The monster designs in this one are absolutely laughable, to the point of embarrassment. That's part of the fun for some, though.WORTH: FF7 only goes on sale only a few times a year, and goes down to about 50% off. You could wait for it to go on sale since it's such an old game, but you will be waiting for a while. With many Final Fantasy titles coming, we may see good bundles with this game in the next year or so.OVERALL: Solid port that has fixed issues both in the original PC and PSX versions. SCORE: 9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												A mediocre Final Fantasy, but still a good RPG. The upped resolution looks good, and the cloud saving works fine, but the game requires a SquareEnix account to even start up, which is silly. It also has this ""Booster"" thing you can use on your cloud save through SquareEnix's website for the game, which utterly ruins the game, with no way to control it outside of ""9999 HP and loads of money!'. Also, it may not be noticable to many, but the translation and writing has been touched up some, with some of the more obvious problems (Aeris: This guy are sick.) being fixed.			"

I am especially happy to be playing it with a Steam controller.  Much more entertaining (some games were just designed to work with a controller better).  I have never played this game before and so far it is turning out to be amazing.  I am only an hour in, taking my time and reading everything carefully - I am enjoying myself COMPLETELY!

												Final Fantasy VII is probably my favorite FF game, next to VI. Maybe my favorite game ever.I never played this in my youth--I played it one year ago when I was 17. I have no blinding nostalgia surrounding this. The game itself is great, and I genuinely think it stands up against the test of time.This port of the game is accurate and polished. There are some blemishes (such as inherent D-Pad functionality not being supported; just bypass that with a manual keymapper), but none of them are fatal.I'm doing a modded playthrough right now (New Thread mod--highly recommend after you've beaten vanilla at least once).If you're hesitant and unsure, pick this up on sale. I can't recommend this masterpiece enough.			"

												I can recommend FFVII on steam, since in itself it is an awesome game, but don't expect SE to have done much to improve upon the experience.Pros:- Awesome game - one of my personal favourites.Cons:- No updated textures - In my opinion, the game is made for an old CRT monitor, and it shows.- Requires SE account to play.- I had a lot of trouble with cloud-saves not working.I can recommend using a controller as well, since its much more natural and it helps bring back the old PS nostalgia.

												A mediocre Final Fantasy, but still a good RPG. The upped resolution looks good, and the cloud saving works fine, but the game requires a SquareEnix account to even start up, which is silly. It also has this ""Booster"" thing you can use on your cloud save through SquareEnix's website for the game, which utterly ruins the game, with no way to control it outside of ""9999 HP and loads of money!'. Also, it may not be noticable to many, but the translation and writing has been touched up some, with some of the more obvious problems (Aeris: This guy are sick.) being fixed.			"

												It's a must play if you enjoy turn based RPG's. Great characters that you can actually connect with and a story for a video game that will keep you interested as to what happens next! I would suggest using an online guide for the game as well because there are a lot of cool features to this game that you can easily miss out on if your unfamiliar with the game itself. I would also have to say that just for the materia (Spells,Commands,Summons etc) system alone in this game would be a reason to play it if you have not experienced it yet. It's one of a kind.			"

												A fun game for a fan of JRPGs. Some people find it a little bizzare, some find it a little wacky, but I found it a fun experience. The biggest let-down of the game is its grind-tastic nature, but otherwise it is fairly solid. I don't know that I would consider it one of the best games of all time like some, but if you sit back, and enjoy the ride, you might just find a very rewarding experience.			"

												This is, without a doubt, one of the best RPGs I've played over the years. It's engaging, it's fun, and the world is so huge, with so much to explore. There's a great variety of enemies, as well as different activites, including many fun minigames. The story is amazing, there's so much going on, yet it all fits very well. And the soundtrack, superb.When it comes to combat, I really liked the ""turn-based but with some real time thrown in it as well"" approach this game has. It makes the battles feel more dynamic as well as strategic. The Materia system is really cool as well, and, in fact, I might prefer it more than the old ""your character gets to learn these specific spells""; in this game, you can equip your characters with whatever magic/summon/command you like, not to mention that the Materia that doesn't fall in those categories can provide different bonuses to your character.I think this review could go on and on for pages, but even then I don't think I'd ever do justice to this game with my words. All I can say is, I enjoyed it greatly, and, if you're a fan of RPGs, I think you will too.			"

												It's already said a million times before but Final Fantasy VII is just simply one of the greatest games of all time. You are doing yourself a disservice if you have never played this game before.  It has the best of everything you want from an RPG (likeable characters, gameplay, story, sidequests, etc.) and piles it all up into a great big pile of awesomeness. Seriously, you know a game is good when you'd rather play this 20 year old gem over any of the new games coming out.			"

												First of all,I'd like to say there is no good or bad game really.It all depends on your personal preferences.One may find a certain game fun while the other might not.Anyway,I'm actually a bit half-half on this game when it comes to recommending and I'll tell you why.-FF7 has a really GREAT storyline to it(that's what I love about Final Fantasy).It's not your typical predictable story.It just pulls you in.PLUS POINTS FOR THAT.-When it comes to gameplay,it's not your typical hack-n-slash style or fps.It involves characters taking turns to make their moves and you select and action for the character to take for example attack/magic/defend etc etc.(If you don't understand what I'm saying,you can always search for a video on youtube on final fantasy 7 battles).Personally I like this system.It's fun and unique:} In case there are people out there who are worried it may be confusing,don't worry,it's not:)PLUS POINTS!-Brilliant cutscenes.For a game that has somewhat ""oldish"" looking graphics (no offence it's a fact),it has some pretty neat looking cutscenes.I was amazed when I saw the first few cutscenes(and the later ones afterwards).I really enjoyed watching every one of it.PLUS POINTS AGAIN!-As you play the main character,you're not alone.You have friends together on your journey:3 Hurray! So,these other characters that join your main character are interesting,fascinating and unique.Having their own rich personality as well and their own stories.PLUS POINTS.Now for the negative part..For some reason,I feel that the amount of damage you can deal is pretty ""suckish"" even if you level up pretty high.Either that or the enemies are superbly strong.Or it could be both.I say that because from my experience from another Final Fantasy game,FFX to be exact,I levelled up my characters to a pretty decent level(not all the way to 99) and I could still win and complete the game)Some enemies can just easily land you one-hit kills.ONE-HIT and you're dead.This pretty much means that it's kinda tricky to take down enemies.It can be really frustrating sometimes.I remember when I was stuck near the final stages of the game where I had to beat the enemy boss.He was so difficult to take down even after 30 mins.I've seen several people on youtube who posts videos of their ff7 gameplays on beating this boss and they successfully did it but I realised something.I've seen people who levelled up their characters all the way to lvl 99,acquired special items from side quests,special moves etc(basially it's like they've gone through almost everthing in the game) and yet,it still takes some time to beat the boss.So it's still a little bit tricky but it's possible.And to get to lvl 99 and acquire all those special items and moves is a whole different story.You will need A LOT OF PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE with this game.That is like the key to this game.If you have that,then this negative part of the review should not be a problem for you~p.s This review is a personal view and opinion.I understand that not everyone will agree with me as they have their opinions as well.I can respect that.Also,everyone's gonna have their own different and unique experiences from the game.Oh and one more thing I need to admit.Remember I said you need a lot of patience with this game?Yeah...I don't have that.So I'm actually stuck at the final boss.Yup.I do NOT have the time and patience to do all the side missions and battle for hours and hours just to get to lvl 99 all just to beat that one freaking♥♥♥♥♥boss.I find that it's not worth my time.But if you feel otherwise,by all means go ahead~ There's an amazing cutscene after that and well,not forgetting the sense of satisfaction and achievement it bringsTvT All in all,it's best to have your own experience of the game:) "

												FINAL FANTASY VII as a game is amazing for its time however the PC/Steam port is pathetic. My custom made top end PC does not like the old graphics and they like to glitch around a lot. The whole linking to SE's system is just extra crap that we don't need. It is better in it's original state on PS1 or you would be better off getting the PS3 downloadable version as that one does not have the porting issues that the PC has.Some of the issues include the aforementioned glitches in the graphics but also poor sound quality in music and sound effects, the attempt to scale it to the average computer screen makes it fuzzy and honestly shows that it has not aged well graphically. Some games just don't and this game is one of them. This port does not do the game the justice it deserves.			"

												You need an internet connection to log into a Square Enix account to play this game. It's kind of annoying, but not really a huge deal in this day and age. I'm not really a fan of this type of business practice though, so buyer beware. Other than that, this is a great way for new players to finally experience Final Fantasy VII. To get the most out of the experience, I'd recommend setting up controls for a controller, buying an hdmi cable to hook it up to your TV, and play it like you would on a console so that you can get the original experience. I like to play this game hooked up to my TV with a controller, while drinking beer. It's very relaxing. Also, at one point Cloud crossdresses.			"

												“Let’s mosey!”I effectively ruined my original '97 hardcopy dics with how often I've replayed and burned through this game. The entire VII compilation (from Before Crisis to Advent Children) is something I hold very near and dear to my heart. VII isn't everyone's favorite Final Fantasy installation, saying it doesn't live up to it's hype, but I honestly think you can't overstate how EPIC this game is. It rightfully holds its place on the pedestal of one of the greats in the series--and in gaming entirely. Classic FF battle mechanics with the addition of a GREAT materia system makes necessary leveling up enjoyable. Graphics are most certainly dated, but to be honest, it’s so easy to look past playing with blocks of colored polygons for characters on maps. That’s how good it is. An engrossing story; good gameplay; a memorable, iconic soundtrack; and the most beautiful characterization and character development (especially if you follow the ragtag team throughout the compilation) that isn’t selective to a choice few party members—and you’ve got yourself a game that still remains strong after nearly 20 years.

												Bringing back the same incredible game and experience that blew RPG fans the f*** back , a timeless story , incredible cast ( Cloud Strifu , Million Dollar Baby , Terry Crews , and many others! ) , a beautiful story and though the graphics are of another time , the game feels and plays a lot smoother on Steam than it even did on the original playstation , it even looks better ! The online cloud function is a win , though I know people got a little mad and some would even go far enough to consider it ""cheating"" , which is total rubbish . A lot of gamers have already played this cult classic to death , and even then want to relive the timeless experience that is FF7 - without spending more time than necessary grinding - especially since we've already finished this game several times! So if you don't want to grind any more than you should , your prayers have been answered .Don't get it twisted though , as this game isn't only for veterans . If you've never played Final Fantasy VII and want to play arguably one of the best JRPGs ever made , and also potentially develop a HUGE crush on Tifa ( something about her post battle celebration , oh lord . )  , I now , more than EVER , STRONGLY RECOMMEND you buy this game on steam and play it inside out , if anything , it'll prepare you for whats to come in gaming's biggest remake to date . There's nothing that can be said about the game itself that hasn't already been said - there isn't a gamer out there that can deny the hype behind the remake of VII , and it is THIS game that is the very source of it . Will FF7's remake live up to the hype? Probably not , but this original is what created the hype in the very first place.			"

												My favorite game from my favorite genre. This is the most nostalgic game of my childhood and I've beat it about 10 times. Its easily one of the most influential games of all time. As far as this version, its ok but not perfect. I would say the best way to play it is the ps1 classic on the Vita. This game is a direct port of the original and somewhat flawed PC version however the Steam version does have enhanced character models and has been patched to include the original PS1 soundtrack instead of the midi files.

												One of the best FF games ever. I used to play it two or three times on PlayStation one and on PC before the official release. Magnificent soundtrack, interesting plot, remarkable heroes and best villain ever! Sephiroth, we love you! If you never ever happened to play this game you had lost a lot. Don't mind the graphics, FFVII is just what your're looking for!~ ~ ~Одна из лучших игр серии ФФ. Играла в неё два или три раза на первой Плэйстейшн и на компьютере, ещё до официального релиза. Великолепная музыка, интересный сюжет, запоминающиеся герои и лучший злодей всех времён! Сефирот, мы тебя любим! Если вы никогда не садились за эту игру, то многое потеряли. Графика здесь не главное, ФФ7 - именно то, что вы искали!			"

												When this game came out 17 years ago, it was for many, babies first JRPG.If you're looking for a challenging JRPG and never played FFVII, then don't expect it to deliver that (Try FFIV). Nevertheless despite how♥♥♥♥♥♥easy it was, you should still buy it for its visuals. music, and overall entertaining scenarios. FFVII was a hallmark of the PS1 era. It was the game that defined what was once the most dominant developer in the industry at the time: Squaresoft. It innovated the industry with its outstanding cutscenes that were just completely jawdropping at the time. Despite the fact that the ingame models look really primitive (even for back then), I wouldn't have it any other way. They just work with the art style and you'll grow to love them within ten  minutes of the game.That said, the game had one of the most obnoxious and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gaming fanbases on the face of the internet. It's almost bad enough where you could get to the point where you might even despise the game itself.			"

												After the 3rd or 4th time in my life starting Final Fantasy 7, I've finally finished it (and all of the Steam Achievements to go with it including the 'This achievement was clearly meant to make you pointlessly grind for a few hours', ones).Definitely glad I got through it all this time though. Still rank it as one of the best games I've ever played in my life, which I said about it, even before finishing it in the past.Now that I'll likely never touch it again though, I leave it with this picture I made.Enjoy. http://i.imgur.com/pAGFYra.gif "

												A lot of people call this game the best. Do I think its the best? No. (But only because I'm a nerd for love stories)That being said if I wasn't more into love stores then yes, it would be the best. It has a great story that will stay with you for years (I played it as a kid and adult and still dont fully get the story). There is also just so much to do. to 100% complete it (which I never have nor do I intend to) you will put a decent amount of hours. (this coming from the girl who put 113 hours into pokemon)This game will always make my 10 ten list.			"

												Final Fantasy VII, a legend in the RPG genre. Now includes native XBOX 360 Controller and wireless support as well as extra options to change the graphics between original and remastered, original and full screen aspect ratio and more.Local and online Cloud saves are a big bonus as well as progress achievements.[Edit]: Just realized that the Cloud save feature was removed. :/ That sucks, but still a great game.SquareEnix has turned Final Fantasy VII into an even better game for the PC. :)			"

												Very disappointing, despite the many positive reviews - I found it very dull. The plot is poorly translated/written, characters have no depth, so I was unable to become invested in them or the story. Requiring a lot of patience from the player, the polygon aspect is unappealing and often jarring. Being a big FF fan, I found this to be my least favourite of the series. Baring in mind this is an older game, it offers very little and leaves a lot to be desired. This is not to say there aren't parts that are enjoyable, for most people it offers nostalgic value from playing it at a young age, which I didn't have for my play-through.			"

												It's hard not to overstate my love for this game, It's pretty much my fourth favourite game of all time, just behind Final Fantasy 6, Persona 4, and Metal gear Solid 3.  It's one of those games which is completely umissable to play if you're a fan of the turn based genre, the bucket loads of praise its recieved even now is well deserved, with an absoloutely incredible OST to boot. This is a straight up port from the original PC version with very minor additions, including a rather pointless feature of being able to boost and give yourself max level and stats and what not, which is fine for people who just want to see the story, but the game is so very easy already, it's just there as a free bonus if you wish to use it. Another very amusing addition is the inclusion of mouths to the polygon models  As seen here! it adds nothing, and I have no idea why it's even a thing, but it looks funny as hell, so I keep it on.In short, you owe it to yourself to play this game if you haven't, perhaps just to see what all the fuss is about. This port is now the best way to play the game past the original PS1 version, so what are you waiting for?			"

												After spending more than 100 hours on the PSX I had to buy this masterpiece on Steam. An extraordinary JRPG from the golden age of this genre. Final Fantasy VII gets a 10 in almost every department: Character Design, Setting, Story, Gameplay, it's absolutely uncanny how addicting this game can be. Tons of secrets, unlockable party characters, weapons, subquests that will explain backstory and motivations of all your party and not only the main character. And let's not forget the presence of Sephiroth, probably the best villain in all the Final Fantasy saga (togheter with Kefka, from Final Fantasy VI). And the Gold Saucer... wanna talk about the Gold Saucer? This whole game is crazy good. Action, humour, a GREAT story with a major (and unexpected) plot twist... this game is the whole package. Keep in mind that this is a 1997 game though, so graphic-wise it feels a bit old. I personally don't care about it, but you might.MASTERPIECE. Buy it, so maybe Square Enix will give us Xenogears too! :)			"

												While I love the game, I cannot recommend THIS VERSION of this game. If you want this game, buy it anywhere else. Square has a bad issue with secondary launchers on thier PC ports, and they're miserable. On top of that, Keyboard / controller support is also bad.At any time, if your controller disconnects (xbox wireless PC controller) for any length of time, you'll get a critical error and your game will crash. This happened to me at least every two or three hours as I'd put my controller down to use the bathroom and grab a drink I'd come back to a crashed game. If you start your game before you turn on and connect your controller, it will not register the inputs on the controller making you have to close the game and restart it.			"

I explored the game several times, most my playthroughs were capped at 99 hours and 99 minutes. I beat Emerald Weapon, got Omnislash, got the Golden Chocobo and the Knights of the Round materia.I tried to do everything I could, back then having no internet, meant using your head, asking your friends, or buying gaming magazines. It ended up being my first big game, and even today I still have many fond memories of it.Yes the graphics are very dated, but the story is top notch, and after playing it a little bit, Midgar still carries that dark overtone.

												A pivotal moment in my gaming life, FFVII was the first RPG I ever played. It is still my favorite video game of all time.I knew a new PC port was made available on the Square-Enix store last year, but I waited to see if it would come to Steam.  It did, but I still waited to see if it would go on sale. It did, and was an instant purchase.Playing this game on the PC is a fantastic. Loading times are eliminated. 3D models render  at high resolution. There is already a wealth of mods from the original PC version.  Modding in better quality music is a MUST, but is extremely easy to do.Almost 15 years after first playing FFVII, I still haven't beaten it.  My first playthrough, I played 100+ hours; mastering Knights of the Round and killing Ruby Weapon.  I've restarted twice since then, but stil never finished.  Hopefully this time I will.			"

												FFVII was and remains the pinnacle of turn-based RPG adventure games. Set in a dystopian sci-fi fantasy future, the story follows Cloud as he saves the world from the insane and evil Sephiroth. This game holds up extremely well after all these years. I definitely recommend playing with a controller, because it feels really weird to play this game using a mouse and keyboard, but it can be done. This is the epitome of turn-based RPG epics, and is a must-have for any and all fans of the genre. One of my top games that everyone should play at some point in your life. The visuals don't stand up quite as well over time, but it still looks really good. My one and only gripe is that you HAVE to create a Square Enix account to play, but you only need to be connected to the internet when you play the game for the first time, after that it doesn't have to connect to your account anymore.--------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												Nostalgia at its finest, brings memories of me staying home sick to play. This games deserves another play through for anyone who ever enjoyed it years ago....you may grow older, wiser and become to busy...but it would be a great idea to find time for something you use to and still would love to this day. FF7 looks and runs on great, i have a mediocore laptop that actually runs it very well. For the price its hard to argue the value as it seems tought to find the same great value from most modern day games. Invest the 12 bucks and enjoy.do it up!			"

												Arguably the best Final Fantasy ever, this PC port is absolutely gorgeous. It works well right out of the box and there are many ways you can customize the controls to meet your comfort. Square Enix did a good job porting this. The only thing that would be next to it would be a full HD remake with new art, models, effects... but it wouldn't be the same, good ol' Final Fantasy VII we loved when we were young.Absolutely recommended and it should be mandatory for everyone to play this through at least once in their lives.

												Final Fantasy VII, stands its ground to this day as one of the best JRPG's, at the time it was innovative with its design, combat and overall changes. It was definitely one of the stand out moments in the franchise and is a landmark in the gaming continuity. To this day Final Fantasy remains one of my favorite games of all time and this remake was a great rendition and keeps its legacy alive. Its up there with Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 3 and Onimusha 4 as a definitive title for the PlayStation 1 and PC formats. I recommend to anyone who hasn't played this game yet to purchase this fine piece of art, it is a must have for any video game collection.			"

												The best Final Fantasy game, in my opinion. Besides VI. And V. And IV. And I. And X.God I love Final Fantasy.The Good!- It's Final Fantasy VII- Moddable- Slightly Updated ModelsThe Bad...- Graphics have not aged well. Part of this is the port's fault.- The music can sound really awful sometimes...- The Character Booster. It's basically a cheat. No, literally a cheat. I mean, you can use it if you want but...Ugh- Backgrounds... The pre-rendered backgrounds, one of my favorite parts of the game, are really stretched out and pixelated. It's not even a minor issue. The only fix I could find was changing the resolution, because I have a large monitor.- Weird DRM, a lot of people don't seem to like it. You gotta make a Squeenix account and register the game before you can play.			"

												An awesome game in a lot of aspects, I love the combat and the strategy that goes into it.

I really liked the story all the way up to the end, the ending was a little underwelming but other than that awesome!If you like RPG's and you have never played a Final Fantasy game. This is a good game to start with, I would recomend this over 8 for newcommers to the series.			"

												This game is superb. I never had the chance to play this game as a kid and thanks to Steam, I can finally play it. 20 hours in the game and this is the best RPG I have played in years! the story pulls you in and doesn't let you go until you finish, the combat is pretty fun and there is a good variety in attacks and magic spells including summoning, healing, cursing and elemental attacks. the Ultimate attacks achieving at a certain point in battle are nicely made and very well executed despite the limited technology used to create this masterpiece. The world is diverse in many ways, you travel oceans, cities, villages, caves, mines, deserts, hovering theme parks, mountains and many more. There are a lot of side quests to finish and the rewards for finishing them are worth your time if you put hours into finishing a single quest. the variety of monsters to fight is truly jaw dropping and the amount of boss battles each with their own abilities and disadvantages really makes you think of the best way to defeat them. You simply must buy this game and all of its many features and the superb storyline which is both emotional and dark. Once you play this game, you will fall in love with for many years to come			"

												When Final Fantasy VII finally came to Steam I nearly died yo.This game is one of the greatest games of all time. I first played this game on the PlayStation (when I was only young) I played it several times and again when it was released on PSN and now finally on Steam.Final Fantasy VII follows protagonist Cloud Strife a mercenary for hire who joins an eco-terrorist organisation AVALANCHE to stop Shinra from draining the life of the planet for use as a source of energy.Upon its release it was an immediate critical success.As with previous FF games it consists of three areas: A world map, field maps and a battle screen. What makes this game truly unique is the use of the turn-based battle system in which players command the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies. The skill system is based on Materia (magical orbs of condensed life energy) which are used for magic, summons and special abiliies.Good:-Hironobu Sakaguchi is a god-The story is simply amazing and it will literally take your breath away lol-Gameplay is amazing and winning battles against tough enemies is well rewarding (Emerald and Ruby Weapons)-The soundtrack is one the best ever composed in a video game, Nobou Uematsu the composer is a music god lol-The game truly redefined an era of RPGBad:-The Windows/Steam release uses PC MIDI files for its soundtrack which are terrible quality compared to the original on PlayStation, it is strongly recommneded to swap the files which you can do here:

												This Steam port of the PC version pretty much blows the Playstation port out of the water. Smooth textures, little to no grammar errors in dialogue, and none of that inconvenient disc switching. The topping of the sundae is that the superior Playstation MIDI instruments have taken over the generic PC MIDI from the original. Highly recommended.			"

												One of the best RPGs ever made and one of my favorite games of all time.In FF7 . you are trying to stop Sephiroth from absorbing the necessary energy he needs in order to destroy the plane. You control a group named Avalanche and you try to prevent that. The game is full of things to do : explore well hidden towns in the suprisingly enormous map (especially for the time it was released) , grind your way up the levels , find new equipment , fight bosses , enjoy the soundtrack and immerse yourself in an amazing storyline about the battle of good and evil.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is incredibly enjoyable. The battles never get boring! Combat is turn-based , meaning your party will attack one member at a time , then it's the enemy's turn. You can use potions to buff your characters or simply to restore HP , make a basic attack or wait a few rounds until your Ultra-Supa-Dupa-Power attack becomes available in order to smash your enemies. Throughout the game you will meet different characters that can join your party - each one has his one specialties and disadvantages. Make sure you are properly geared up and loot everything you can and save FREQUENTLY!  Exploring the open world in order to find new towns or landmarks is very interesting , however it can sometimes get very frustating because of the random encounters you are forced to deal with once a while. You can run away from them , but this can make you lose money or even let your enemies steal precious gear while trying to. Boss Battles can take a while to finish , especially if you are not properly prepared. Levels are important in this game , so you should take your time to level up and grind a bit - don't just rush the story. Now , note that there are no big green arrows pointing to your next objective (like modern games). Therefore , you will need to listen to the characters' dialogues and use a bit of common sense in order to identify where you will need to go next. At some point of the game you will also be given vehicles you can use to travel the world faster (and safer ,s ince you won't get into random battles). Overall , the main gameplay aspects of the game (combat and exploration) are well done and long-term RPG players will feel familiar with the Mechanics of the game (such as Potion system , vehicles to travel the world , characters to join your party , equipment all around the world). Additionally , there are some nice mini-games that can earn you some money or other stuff (such as Chocobbo Racing) , however I found most of them not very appealing to me , so I didn't pay much attention.Keep in mind there are many ''special'' bosses you will have a chance to fight in order to get some incredibly rare and powerful gear - they are incredibly hard to defeat though and you might not really stand a chance unless you have really put many many hours into the game and Maxed Out most of your stats. Oh , and you can't explore or do anything after you are done with the main story , so make sure you are satisfied with your achievements throughout the game BEFORE you enter the final area of the game.STORYLINEIn the game , you play (mainly) as Cloud Strife -  a young man that still is unsure about his true identity and will try to find out who he really is. Apart from that , you are also part of the AVALANCHE group which was secretly formed to wage a rebellion against Shinra , an organisation which is absorbing Mako energy, destroying the natural world as we know it , in order to fullfilltheir own , dirty plans and take over the world. One of the most interesting and engaging villains of all time , Sephiroth , doesn't want you alive and you will also have to deal with him as he is going mad and loses control of his actions. There are many other side quests you can do as well and you will get to know more about the world around you - and obviously , there are many other stories that developer throughout the game , such as romantic relationships between the characters or conflicts! You get to decide what you will say in many of the dialogues and the cutscenes are really well done and drive-away some of the monotony constant gameplay can cause.TECHNICAL ASPECTS + SOUNDUnfortunately , FF7 is a game that hasn't aged very well (granted , it's 18 years old and was originally released on PlayStation 1 , so it's understandable). It still doesn't look that horrible , however and inspired many modern RPGs. The PC port is also not particularly good either , but most PCs will be able to easily handle it today , so it should no matter what run smoothly. There are many mods you can use to enhance your experience , however I prefer to play games they were meant to be so I didn't try any of them out. Perhaps the visuals aren't great , but the soundtracks of the game are still INCREDIBLE and make me feel incredibly excited.. It's a very weird feeling but the sound it makes when you enter a battle or when a cutscene is playing , it's just so refreshing! I am not an audiophile and I usually don't pay much attention to that sort of stuff , but this game stood out for me. Back to the visuals , the colors are decent and despite the aging graphics , the atmosphere in the dungeons or the snowed mountains for example is still top notch and will certainly not distract you from enjoying the game.CHARACTERSThe characters development through out the game is special and some of the things that happen to them can be gamechanging. You will get emotionally attached to some of them , others you may not like them. And that is a very hard to come up with and something Square Enix put a lot of effort in order to develop. It's hard to find games that put so much emphasis that onto the character development . The characters this time make the story  , but the story also makes the characters. What I mean by that is , that what happens in the world affects the characters but what happens to the characters can also affect the world.CONCLUSIONFinal Fantasy 7 is a game for everyone . It is one of the games that felt nearly perfect and even though it might not have aged out as well as many would have wanted , it's still one of the best games of all time and for many the best RPG ever. All the critics and reviewers of the game in general can't just be dellusional - if you haven't played this game yet , you are missing out big time!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT : Nominated for ''Test Of Time'' Steam Award			"

												One of the most over rated final fantasy games and still very highly talked about to this day since it's release in 1997 and for good reason. Not only does this game have a great cast of characters  but as you progress through the game you can see them chagining emotionally and thats hard to pull off.  before i get talking about it let's get to the pros and the very few cons pros . Excellent battle system : this improoved on the atb system and made it even better .Learning spells from materia : Yes at first it can seem like a chore to do but once you get furthur in the game it's really easy to master materia and gain a good amount of skills especially after game. . Good plots twist : say what? Arn't plot twist in games normally bad? Sometimes yes they are but in cases like this where you see the characters grow and then that unexpected twist comes around and changes everything it's good. . music is amazing do i really need to talk about it ? Here is a sound track from my personal favorites

Cons . Mini games ..... there stupid just don't waste your time with them other then the ones they force you to play. The only decent one is the motor cycle chase scene which i have recorded here (minor spoilers) 


YouTube™ Video: Final fantasy 7 (pc) : part 30 : Motorcycle chase 

			Views: 38		

			I am interested to see what they do with this part in the remake :P		

. Chocobo breeding ...  It is a very long process unless you know the fast way to do it without needing to race and if you don't youre going to have to race a lot ....  however here is the fast way to do things  ! This is a very well put together guide that i used myself

			WORKS ON PS4 AS WELL! Show your love to all the Gold Chocobos in the FF universe and hit LIKE :) And thanks for 200 000 views! All credits to BrutalAl, the original finder of this method.		

Overall this is very much worth a purchess other then the few hiccups i mentioned though if your are just starting out i may reccomend final fantasy 4 and or 9  (which will soon hit pc) this game is more for the experts.			"

												Do not underestimate this game by how old it is. This game is GENIUS! From joining AVALANCHE  to saving the world, this game couldn't of satisfied me more. Materia, Limit Breaks, and even unlocking characters this game is amazing. I know it says it was released on July 4, 2013 (On steam), but the real release date was September 7, 1997 on PS1. It is still popular to this day among steam users. (I recommend Final Fantasy 8 as well but I like this one better).			"

												only worth the 8 bucks I paid cause I don't have to keep the space on my hard drive for the emulator. No new features and the controller support is terrible. Not to mention the performance is really wonky on high performance machines. Save your money. Get an emulator. This feels like someone slapped an emulator into the application and then they tossed it up for sale with little regard for quality.The only thing you're buying is having it available in your steam library.

												Final Fantasy VII is often times considered as one of the most revered and acclaimed games created.  This game is labeled as a 'Classic', a 'Masterpiece', etc.  Having played this game around the time that it first came out I was overwhelmed and as such played the game casually, not taking in the full importance of this game.  Coming back to play this game after experimenting with the newest Final Fantasy (13) I realized that we generally all lost something.  The over-commercialization and graphics card pushing aspects of some of the 'Classic' series have gained the highest degree of importance; replacing the storyline, battle system, customizability, and replayability.  To think that a game produced 16 years ago can still captivate an audience as it does is astounding.			"

												This is a great classic RPG..although either people like it or hate it..i do not consider this the rpg that made all the modern rpg's....i still think OLD FF3 /FF6 was the one that changed rpg on SNES..Anyways, this is a ode to classic rpg's and a great game..There are many things that make this game a great game, and many things that can also turn off people from this game. I believe this was one of the gateway games in making the next gen games more popular. I don't think this was the defining game that changed the gaming industry, but i believe it contributed to it changing the game styles on console usage and pc games.			"

												Arguably the best Final Fantasy ever, this PC port is absolutely gorgeous. It works well right out of the box and there are many ways you can customize the controls to meet your comfort. Square Enix did a good job porting this. The only thing that would be next to it would be a full HD remake with new art, models, effects... but it wouldn't be the same, good ol' Final Fantasy VII we loved when we were young.Absolutely recommended and it should be mandatory for everyone to play this through at least once in their lives.

I went through the cumbersome process of installing it, and I'm not sure if it was worth it. Regardless:http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/07/how-to-make-final-fantasy-vii-look-like-an-hd-remaster/There is an HD remake coming out soon for PS4 which might be good; otherwise, this game is a classic that is definitely worth your 40 hours of gameplay if you are a true RPG fan.

												Omg omg omg omg.Final Fantasy VII on Steam - I has it :DIf only I could copy my PS1 saves to Steam...I played FFVII back in 97~98.I loved the game, the story, the graphics, the characters, everything. I explored the game several times, most my playthroughs were capped at 99 hours and 99 minutes. I beat Emerald Weapon, got Omnislash, got the Golden Chocobo and the Knights of the Round materia.I tried to do everything I could, back then having no internet, meant using your head, asking your friends, or buying gaming magazines. It ended up being my first big game, and even today I still have many fond memories of it.Yes the graphics are very dated, but the story is top notch, and after playing it a little bit, Midgar still carries that dark overtone. Can't wait to play this again. "

												The best Final Fantasy game, in my opinion. Besides VI. And V. And IV. And I. And X.God I love Final Fantasy.The Good!- It's Final Fantasy VII- Moddable- Slightly Updated ModelsThe Bad...- Graphics have not aged well. Part of this is the port's fault.- The music can sound really awful sometimes...- The Character Booster. It's basically a cheat. No, literally a cheat. I mean, you can use it if you want but...Ugh- Backgrounds... The pre-rendered backgrounds, one of my favorite parts of the game, are really stretched out and pixelated. It's not even a minor issue. The only fix I could find was changing the resolution, because I have a large monitor.- Weird DRM, a lot of people don't seem to like it. You gotta make a Squeenix account and register the game before you can play.			"

												What can I say about Final Fantasy VII? Well this was the very first game that I ever bought with my own money, and thats why I think it means so much to me. Even as I play it on a xbox 360 controller; I miss the sounds of a playstation humming in the back ground and the feel of a ps1 controller. I have bought this game on ever platform that it has came out on. This is the best Final Fantasy that I have ever played and have made it a tradition of beating it all the way though and doing all the side quest. This is the game that got me in to gaming and I love it. If you like JRPGs and immersing yourself into a game for 50+ hrs buy this game and I promise you'll love or I won't buy it back from you. Also Final Fantasy 7 will help you with the ladies, but I can't promise you that.			"

												This game is superb. I never had the chance to play this game as a kid and thanks to Steam, I can finally play it. 20 hours in the game and this is the best RPG I have played in years! the story pulls you in and doesn't let you go until you finish, the combat is pretty fun and there is a good variety in attacks and magic spells including summoning, healing, cursing and elemental attacks. the Ultimate attacks achieving at a certain point in battle are nicely made and very well executed despite the limited technology used to create this masterpiece. The world is diverse in many ways, you travel oceans, cities, villages, caves, mines, deserts, hovering theme parks, mountains and many more. There are a lot of side quests to finish and the rewards for finishing them are worth your time if you put hours into finishing a single quest. the variety of monsters to fight is truly jaw dropping and the amount of boss battles each with their own abilities and disadvantages really makes you think of the best way to defeat them. You simply must buy this game and all of its many features and the superb storyline which is both emotional and dark. Once you play this game, you will fall in love with for many years to come			"

												Hands down best Final Fantasy ever made. They wouldn't remake a game that wasn't worth it. Not to mention the spin off games and a movie. There is sooo much to do in this game that i'm sure you will enjoy. The story is actually pretty interesting too. I can easily give this game a 10/10. Try it out.         link to new Final Fantasy VII video -

												I was very excited to get this game again.  I owned the original PS release, as well as the first port to PC, but it won't load on Windows 10.  After hours of google search and trying to get support from Square-Enix for 4 days, I gave up getting it to work.  I couldn't get past Error 740 when hitting play, and couldn't get to actual gameplay.  It's supposed to be an issue with a virus scan, but my attempts to get around it didn't work.  I'm glad so many have been able to get it work...I wish I could have.			"

												while I have not played it fully (i'm stuck in the wierd theme park), I love this game for all the combat elements and adventure with great characters. I can't describe it well, but I know many others can. The best I can say is play the game if you want to sell your soul into the game for a lifetime of adventure. ok, truly not a life time, but it takes a long damn time to complete the game.my final rating has yet to come, but right now I will give this a 9/10			"

												One of the most over rated final fantasy games and still very highly talked about to this day since it's release in 1997 and for good reason. Not only does this game have a great cast of characters  but as you progress through the game you can see them chagining emotionally and thats hard to pull off.  before i get talking about it let's get to the pros and the very few cons pros . Excellent battle system : this improoved on the atb system and made it even better .Learning spells from materia : Yes at first it can seem like a chore to do but once you get furthur in the game it's really easy to master materia and gain a good amount of skills especially after game. . Good plots twist : say what? Arn't plot twist in games normally bad? Sometimes yes they are but in cases like this where you see the characters grow and then that unexpected twist comes around and changes everything it's good. . music is amazing do i really need to talk about it ? Here is a sound track from my personal favorites

Cons . Mini games ..... there stupid just don't waste your time with them other then the ones they force you to play. The only decent one is the motor cycle chase scene which i have recorded here (minor spoilers)

. Chocobo breeding ...  It is a very long process unless you know the fast way to do it without needing to race and if you don't youre going to have to race a lot ....  however here is the fast way to do things  ! This is a very well put together guide that i used myself

			WORKS ON PS4 AS WELL! Show your love to all the Gold Chocobos in the FF universe and hit LIKE :) And thanks for 200 000 views! All credits to BrutalAl, the original finder of this method.		

Overall this is very much worth a purchess other then the few hiccups i mentioned though if your are just starting out i may reccomend final fantasy 4 and or 9  (which will soon hit pc) this game is more for the experts.			"

												The best game of the series for me followed by 8 and then 10 but this game has to have the best story for pulling you in I still rememebr the day I bought this for PS1, back when I was 15 (which was 15 yrs ago lol) I had endless nights of staying up late playing this game and probably had more sleep during school lessons than ever lol. The story just twists so many times during the game it really makes it the masterpiece that is I mean how many games do this now for example you start off blowing up a reactor for some miletent group for it only to twist and then your doing something else for it to twist again and again and this is what keeps this games story fresh.You get one main objective Sephiroth but it's not as easy you think and during that journey your meet and help people along the way again there are some fantastic moments of story twists that just keep you wanting more, for me play after school only to be playing for hours in to the late hours. You will get a lot of people saying this isn't the best one of the series and I except that it's personal preference but if you've never played this game of the series the re done PC version on here is worth buying (wait for sale if you want) and playing since it's had it's music fixed it's exactly like the PS1 version.If there is one thing I do miss about the first time I played this game is the feeling of what's going to happen next I've played it over and over in the last 15 yrs and I never get bored as I try to change the way I play but I would kill for that experience again of playing the game the first time back when I was 15.

												Quite possibly the best Japanese RPG ever. Everybody should play this game once. A unique story with twists and turns together with memorable characters make this one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. The pre-rendered background graphics are kind of dated today, but the in-game 3D models for the PC version have now been updated and they look good. However I recommend replacing the bundled .ogg files with the FF7 Ogg Music ZIP available from the following site because it is higher quality and sounds more like the original PS1 game.http://www.icksmehl.de/ff7/downloads.php "

												At last i beat the s**t out of this game!... It's nice to play this classic again, works very well on new systems. I had a crash or two, but nothing dramatic if you save at each given spot... especially now that you don't have to deal with the enless PS1 loadings or savegame access times we had back in the days. I recommend a gamepad to play this, much more practical. Although enjoyable, the J-RPG formula kinda get on my nerves after the second half of the game. I was happy to play this game again... but after a while you wish to finish it  ASAP and move on to something else. The longer you play, the more it feels like a chore. I suggest to get it only with a good sale applied on it.			"

												Stars bolt around the screen as if being gazed upon by some drunk in the middle of the night, only to fade to the image of a young woman holding a basket of flowers, strolling into a vast industrial city the only light being the faint flicker of houses and the green glow of the mako reactors, amongst the pitch black polluted sky above. ""Final Fantasy VII"" scrolls across the screen as a drum roll picks up, slowly zooming into a platform, with quick interruptions from a speeding train grinding to a spark spitting halt. A woman and three blokes jump out and take down several guards, ""C'mon Newcomer"" shouts the burly black guy in am armless shirt. A spiky headed blonde, purple jumpsuit sporting dude backflips of the train with a sword bigger than him. Battle commences and you are thrust straight into the fray, swinging said sword and conjuring lightning.Cinematic gold within five minutes.From start to finish, Final Fantasy VII is an intense roller-coaster ride in terms of everything you'd expect from a video game and more. As if seeing the copious amounts of five star reviews for this game wasn't enough, one quick search for FF7 provides commercial acclaim left and right. People hold this game close to their hearts, stick up for it vigilantly, often ignore its (minimal) shortcomings and its not difficult to understand why. Released in 1997, 2 years after the Playstation One's world wide release, VII boasted a brand new, groundbreaking experience. Not many games were spread across three discs.. but the length of the game pretty much demanded it. My first experience of this game was in 1998 whilst visiting a friend I witnessed something fascinating, simply hearing the music as I walked into the room was enough to peek my interest but actually seeing 3 mysterious characters using all sorts of magic and summoning gigantic beasts to aid them in battle was, for lack of a better word, breathtaking. A few months later the same friend turned up LATE for my 8th birthday party, suffice to say all was forgiven when I realised what he had given me. By far the best gift I have ever received, it put all other presents to forgotten shame, and that was the beginning.The battle system in Final Fantasy has largely remained unchanged throughout the early games, utilising 3 varied characters, each with a different class or set of abilities and stats, to ultimately defeat an opposing enemy. Taking turns, making use of magic, physical attacks and abilities. Often offering a different experience each time. VII is no different but improves on its predecessors considerably with new additions such as the materia system. Materia, a large part of the game involved not just in combat but story as well, is essentially an item equipped to enable the use of the specific magic within it. Its a rather unique system as there are so many combinations and levels in materia alone that its worth exploring the entire world to find every last type. The world itself is a strong reason alone as to why this game is so vast, featuring several locations ranging from the massive powerhouse conglomerate city of Midgar to a small snowy village where the only pass time is snowboarding. VII's amusement park, Gold Saucer is a marvel to behold, abundant in mini games that make the stresses of the game fade slightly if only for a moment.Surroundings alone aren't enough however, Square had to go one further and get veteran composer Nobuo Uematsu to come up with one of the most memorable and emotional soundtracks ever made. The music enhances not only the environment but also effects the mood during dialogue. A whopping 85 MIDI tracks have never sounded this good. Whether its a sense of urgency, romance, pure adrenaline fuelled action, the soundtrack comes up trumps every time. Stories are a dying aspect in recent video games, its all for graphics and gameplay alone, with no magic, no plot, no heart. VII in many ways is like a novel, with thousands of conversations and sub plots to get stuck into, you can't help but experience them all. I can understand how insane that must sound, comparing similarities between a video game and a novel, but that just shows how in depth the story really is and how high I regard it. Keep in mind that many gamers would avoid or completely disregard a video game dubbed to have similar qualities of a book.In the beginning you are thrust into a job with a group of environmentalists/activists/terrorists known as AVALANCHE, trying to take down ShinRa Inc. the ones behind the reactors that suck the land dry of its life source, mako. As you skulk through Midgar with your group you get to know all of its members, finding main characters along the way, get sidetracked, separate and reunite after major battles only to finally discover there is a greater evil at work. Events take you all around the globe via boats, submarines, airships, buggies and or course chocobos. You'll witness more incredible scenes at caverns, beaches, glaciers, temples, mountain tops, marshes, the ocean floor, the sky and even outer space, all whilst taking on nightmarish enemies and gaining new powers. Limit Breaks spice up battles using unique individual abilities to deal major damage after taking enough yourself. Secret characters hide away and must be convinced to aid you in your quest to save the world from utter chaos and destruction. If all that wasn't enough, you can try your hand at taking on optional bosses that appear in the later stages of the game, some with over 1,000,000 Hit Points. Final Fantasy VII has endured so much success it has spawned several spin offs.    Advent Children, a film set 2 years after the events of VII    Dirge of Cerberus, a PS2 game revealing further insight to one of VII's most mysterious characters    Last Order, a short anime film remodelling one of the epic events of VII    Before Crisis, a mobile phone game about ShinRa's special branch, The Turks    Crisis Core, a PSP game shedding light on events before VIIWith all that you could say Square-Enix have milked the franchise, but to be fair to them, they have gone about it with respect to the original and catered to the fans needs. Its no wonder that with all this success, the internet forums are a buzz with the hype of a remake. If all my ramblings of reminiscant nostalgia hasn't at least tempted you, my apologies, but it is my impression that you are missing out on an absolute gem and the best game ever made. 15 years later, its still going strong.

												I want to start off this review by stating the fact that I have never played this game, as a matter of fact... I've never any of the Final Fantasy games. So this review will be 100% nostalgia free.As you can already see, Final Fantasy is an RPG that was released in 1999 for the ps one (I belive) and it has aged very well. The reason why I love this game is because of the amount of things you can do. You can grind your levels to make your self over powered and destroy your foes, do mini games or even follow the main story missions. The game gives you many options as right off the bat there is 3 characters you recieve. Think of it this way, it plays very much like pokemon (Which I love) you can level up all of your characters, increasing thier health and the amount of damage you deal. However, the story all revolves around a character named Cloud (who is a total badass) so you will be running around as him the entire time.I want to keep this review short, what I just mentioned was only a tiny portion of the game. Its is a MUST BUY, I personally would give it 100/100, its the perfect rpg. Best £7 i've ever spent. Even tho my review is quite unimpressionable, the game its self needs to experianced first hand. Just buy it.			"

While going for 100% complete is tedious and trying as always (see: RPG, JRPG, Achievements List), FF7 is still a fun game, with diverse events, plenty of drama, much of it psychological, with heavy philosophical tones. For those reliving a previous playing, take your time and enjoy the reminiscint scenes.			"

												This game hardly needs another review. It is quite simply one of the best video games of all time and well worth another look on PC. The mods available for the PC version make it quite worthwhile for any who enjoyed playing it for the PSX. I was a fan back in the day but wondered whether I would enjoy it quite as much--whether I had perhaps overhyped it in my youth. I certainly did not. Final Fantasy VII still stands as a masterpiece almost 20 years later. If you haven't played it yet: you should. If you enjoyed it before you won't regret playing it again on steam. 10/10.			"

												An awesome game in a lot of aspects, I love the combat and the strategy that goes into it. Though at the end of the game most of the strategy goes out the window, it still feels really good to just wreck everything. I really liked the story all the way up to the end, the ending was a little underwelming but other than that awesome!If you like RPG's and you have never played a Final Fantasy game. This is a good game to start with, I would recomend this over 8 for newcommers to the series.			"

												There are those who say that this is the best entry in one of the best game franchises ever. They are wrong. FF6 is better. However this game is able to beat FF10, mostly because Cloud never decided to laugh like a rabid moron. I digress. Purchase this very fine classic for nostalgia, or to experience what your one friend keeps on nagging you on to try.			"

												This JRPG was the game that introduced me to the genre. Many people will say this is the best RPG ever made, if not the best game ever made. I disagree. It's a very good game, but nostalgia seems sweeter than this product.The music and graphics havn't aged well. Thankfully there are many user mods available to help with this. The gameplay is standard Final Fantasy fare and holds up well, though. You will read through an epic story, explore new areas, and participate in both random and scripted battles that can play out in either partially real-time or strictly turn-based modes. There is no job/class system in this game. Instead, the Materia system will define what actions your characters can take in battle as well as modifying their base stats.Some of the translation problems that plagued the original PSX version have been fixed. There are still many moments in the game that are heavily influenced by Japanese culture and will have some Westerners shaking their head with incredulity. The one scenario that pops into my head is the cross-dressing quest that will take the protagonist to a gym with a cross-dressing owner and a bordello where the hero can get taken advantage of by a group of men in a sauna. Thankfully, there are no Onsen scenes where the females compare breast sizes like the one that exists in Final Fantasy X-2.This port will let you play Final Fantasy VII with all of its flaws and charm. It may not be the best game ever, but it is a good Final Fantasy game and worth checking out if you're a fan of the series.			"

												I want to start off this review by stating the fact that I have never played this game, as a matter of fact... I've never any of the Final Fantasy games. So this review will be 100% nostalgia free.As you can already see, Final Fantasy is an RPG that was released in 1999 for the ps one (I belive) and it has aged very well. The reason why I love this game is because of the amount of things you can do. You can grind your levels to make your self over powered and destroy your foes, do mini games or even follow the main story missions. The game gives you many options as right off the bat there is 3 characters you recieve. Think of it this way, it plays very much like pokemon (Which I love) you can level up all of your characters, increasing thier health and the amount of damage you deal. However, the story all revolves around a character named Cloud (who is a total badass) so you will be running around as him the entire time.I want to keep this review short, what I just mentioned was only a tiny portion of the game. Its is a MUST BUY, I personally would give it 100/100, its the perfect rpg. Best £7 i've ever spent. Even tho my review is quite unimpressionable, the game its self needs to experianced first hand. Just buy it.			"

												Still classic, but at least now I have a computer that can handle it! While going for 100% complete is tedious and trying as always (see: RPG, JRPG, Achievements List), FF7 is still a fun game, with diverse events, plenty of drama, much of it psychological, with heavy philosophical tones. For those reliving a previous playing, take your time and enjoy the reminiscint scenes.			"

												The best game of the series for me followed by 8 and then 10 but this game has to have the best story for pulling you in I still rememebr the day I bought this for PS1, back when I was 15 (which was 15 yrs ago lol) I had endless nights of staying up late playing this game and probably had more sleep during school lessons than ever lol. The story just twists so many times during the game it really makes it the masterpiece that is I mean how many games do this now for example you start off blowing up a reactor for some miletent group for it only to twist and then your doing something else for it to twist again and again and this is what keeps this games story fresh.You get one main objective Sephiroth but it's not as easy you think and during that journey your meet and help people along the way again there are some fantastic moments of story twists that just keep you wanting more, for me play after school only to be playing for hours in to the late hours. You will get a lot of people saying this isn't the best one of the series and I except that it's personal preference but if you've never played this game of the series the re done PC version on here is worth buying (wait for sale if you want) and playing since it's had it's music fixed it's exactly like the PS1 version.If there is one thing I do miss about the first time I played this game is the feeling of what's going to happen next I've played it over and over in the last 15 yrs and I never get bored as I try to change the way I play but I would kill for that experience again of playing the game the first time back when I was 15.

												Quite possibly the best Japanese RPG ever. Everybody should play this game once. A unique story with twists and turns together with memorable characters make this one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. The pre-rendered background graphics are kind of dated today, but the in-game 3D models for the PC version have now been updated and they look good. However I recommend replacing the bundled .ogg files with the FF7 Ogg Music ZIP available from the following site because it is higher quality and sounds more like the original PS1 game.http://www.icksmehl.de/ff7/downloads.php "

												At last i beat the s**t out of this game!... It's nice to play this classic again, works very well on new systems. I had a crash or two, but nothing dramatic if you save at each given spot... especially now that you don't have to deal with the enless PS1 loadings or savegame access times we had back in the days. I recommend a gamepad to play this, much more practical. Although enjoyable, the J-RPG formula kinda get on my nerves after the second half of the game. I was happy to play this game again... but after a while you wish to finish it  ASAP and move on to something else. The longer you play, the more it feels like a chore. I suggest to get it only with a good sale applied on it.			"

												Stars bolt around the screen as if being gazed upon by some drunk in the middle of the night, only to fade to the image of a young woman holding a basket of flowers, strolling into a vast industrial city the only light being the faint flicker of houses and the green glow of the mako reactors, amongst the pitch black polluted sky above. ""Final Fantasy VII"" scrolls across the screen as a drum roll picks up, slowly zooming into a platform, with quick interruptions from a speeding train grinding to a spark spitting halt. A woman and three blokes jump out and take down several guards, ""C'mon Newcomer"" shouts the burly black guy in am armless shirt. A spiky headed blonde, purple jumpsuit sporting dude backflips of the train with a sword bigger than him. Battle commences and you are thrust straight into the fray, swinging said sword and conjuring lightning.Cinematic gold within five minutes.From start to finish, Final Fantasy VII is an intense roller-coaster ride in terms of everything you'd expect from a video game and more. As if seeing the copious amounts of five star reviews for this game wasn't enough, one quick search for FF7 provides commercial acclaim left and right. People hold this game close to their hearts, stick up for it vigilantly, often ignore its (minimal) shortcomings and its not difficult to understand why. Released in 1997, 2 years after the Playstation One's world wide release, VII boasted a brand new, groundbreaking experience. Not many games were spread across three discs.. but the length of the game pretty much demanded it. My first experience of this game was in 1998 whilst visiting a friend I witnessed something fascinating, simply hearing the music as I walked into the room was enough to peek my interest but actually seeing 3 mysterious characters using all sorts of magic and summoning gigantic beasts to aid them in battle was, for lack of a better word, breathtaking. A few months later the same friend turned up LATE for my 8th birthday party, suffice to say all was forgiven when I realised what he had given me. By far the best gift I have ever received, it put all other presents to forgotten shame, and that was the beginning.The battle system in Final Fantasy has largely remained unchanged throughout the early games, utilising 3 varied characters, each with a different class or set of abilities and stats, to ultimately defeat an opposing enemy. Taking turns, making use of magic, physical attacks and abilities. Often offering a different experience each time. VII is no different but improves on its predecessors considerably with new additions such as the materia system. Materia, a large part of the game involved not just in combat but story as well, is essentially an item equipped to enable the use of the specific magic within it. Its a rather unique system as there are so many combinations and levels in materia alone that its worth exploring the entire world to find every last type. The world itself is a strong reason alone as to why this game is so vast, featuring several locations ranging from the massive powerhouse conglomerate city of Midgar to a small snowy village where the only pass time is snowboarding. VII's amusement park, Gold Saucer is a marvel to behold, abundant in mini games that make the stresses of the game fade slightly if only for a moment.Surroundings alone aren't enough however, Square had to go one further and get veteran composer Nobuo Uematsu to come up with one of the most memorable and emotional soundtracks ever made. The music enhances not only the environment but also effects the mood during dialogue. A whopping 85 MIDI tracks have never sounded this good. Whether its a sense of urgency, romance, pure adrenaline fuelled action, the soundtrack comes up trumps every time. Stories are a dying aspect in recent video games, its all for graphics and gameplay alone, with no magic, no plot, no heart. VII in many ways is like a novel, with thousands of conversations and sub plots to get stuck into, you can't help but experience them all. I can understand how insane that must sound, comparing similarities between a video game and a novel, but that just shows how in depth the story really is and how high I regard it. Keep in mind that many gamers would avoid or completely disregard a video game dubbed to have similar qualities of a book.In the beginning you are thrust into a job with a group of environmentalists/activists/terrorists known as AVALANCHE, trying to take down ShinRa Inc. the ones behind the reactors that suck the land dry of its life source, mako. As you skulk through Midgar with your group you get to know all of its members, finding main characters along the way, get sidetracked, separate and reunite after major battles only to finally discover there is a greater evil at work. Events take you all around the globe via boats, submarines, airships, buggies and or course chocobos. You'll witness more incredible scenes at caverns, beaches, glaciers, temples, mountain tops, marshes, the ocean floor, the sky and even outer space, all whilst taking on nightmarish enemies and gaining new powers. Limit Breaks spice up battles using unique individual abilities to deal major damage after taking enough yourself. Secret characters hide away and must be convinced to aid you in your quest to save the world from utter chaos and destruction. If all that wasn't enough, you can try your hand at taking on optional bosses that appear in the later stages of the game, some with over 1,000,000 Hit Points. Final Fantasy VII has endured so much success it has spawned several spin offs.    Advent Children, a film set 2 years after the events of VII    Dirge of Cerberus, a PS2 game revealing further insight to one of VII's most mysterious characters    Last Order, a short anime film remodelling one of the epic events of VII    Before Crisis, a mobile phone game about ShinRa's special branch, The Turks    Crisis Core, a PSP game shedding light on events before VIIWith all that you could say Square-Enix have milked the franchise, but to be fair to them, they have gone about it with respect to the original and catered to the fans needs. Its no wonder that with all this success, the internet forums are a buzz with the hype of a remake. If all my ramblings of reminiscant nostalgia hasn't at least tempted you, my apologies, but it is my impression that you are missing out on an absolute gem and the best game ever made. 15 years later, its still going strong.

												Love this game to death. Mindblowing, heart-stopping nostalgia at every turn for me.Although..When I was little, I had this for PS1..And strangely enough, for some weird reason, I was able to bypass the max HP and MP limits, going up to at least 50k on HP and 1k-2k on MP.And some of the story was different. Warning! Spoiler Below!  In the part where Barret and Cait Sith are going past the weapon that went to Junon, I actually had to fight him before he was shot by the cannon, which is weird.I still to this day do not understand what version of the game I had, but I gotta say, it was still awesome!

												A pivotal moment in my gaming life, FFVII was the first RPG I ever played. It is still my favorite video game of all time.I knew a new PC port was made available on the Square-Enix store last year, but I waited to see if it would come to Steam.  It did, but I still waited to see if it would go on sale. It did, and was an instant purchase.Playing this game on the PC is a fantastic. Loading times are eliminated. 3D models render  at high resolution. There is already a wealth of mods from the original PC version.  Modding in better quality music is a MUST, but is extremely easy to do.Almost 15 years after first playing FFVII, I still haven't beaten it.  My first playthrough, I played 100+ hours; mastering Knights of the Round and killing Ruby Weapon.  I've restarted twice since then, but stil never finished.  Hopefully this time I will.			"

												Let's get down to brass tacks: for vets of the series, this is Final Fantasy VII the way you remember it. If you don't have a Playstation or the ability to play this through more ""unscrupulous"" means, by all means this is what you want in a moddable package until the Remake comes out.Now, for you uneducated in the ways of VII, here's the real meat: Final Fantasy VII tells the tale of a ragtag little party initially out to save the Planet from being sucked dry by the Shinra Corporation. Along the way, things go south and blah blah blah even if you haven't played it you know the story with how much Square has thrown into the Compilation of VII. There are some plot twists that most may not know of because of the framing around it, and if you want to know the whole backstory of what led up to the various famous events, you'll find VII to be very accomodating in the way of letting you experience them.This is done by way of various, at the time and even now, enjoyable facets of the ATB battle system. Active Time Battle is just what it sounds like: each character has a bar, it fills up over time, and then you can make your action. If you choose Active for the battle system, enemies can attack while you make your choice. Choose Wait, and action pauses while you do so. This allows you a small degree of customization on the difficulty of the battles, as you can either choose to think your turns through or you can put yourself on the spot by making decisions relatively on the fly when a boss is breathing down your neck.Beyond this lies the Materia system. An extension of the Esper system from VI, Materia function as a condensed way to grant your party magic. As you battle, the Materia grow and develop skills. When mastered they create duplicates, and no skill is tied to one character. You want a scary guy with a gun on his arm dropping meteors? Go ahead and give him Comet. Get the urge to make your meteor dropper the spiky haired blond dude? Take the Comet materia off of the scary guy, give it to spiky dude. Simple as that, but so much more in-depth because of the stat boosts and penalties attached to the materia itself. HP, strength, luck, magic, all affected by the type of materia equipped.The bottom line, barring any moddable issues that other reviews may cover, is this: VII is still as good as it was. Nostalgia goggles are wicked in terms of this game for some people, but as someone who played it at 12 years old then came back 15 years later and played it again? A few times? I still had a major blast with it. If it's on sale, pick it up. If you have a small fortune spare on hand from playing the market? Pick it up then too. It's a long ride, but it's enjoyable.			"

												There's nothing I don't like about this game and I'm glad you restored the original to allow it to run on modern hardware. The PS3 tech demo lead me to believe that the game was going to be restored with that level of quality and technological advancement, but I'm not disappointed that it didn't because apparently you had that instore for Final Fantasy VII Remake. This version allows players to experience the original with some improvements, but without changes to the storyline and I like that.			"

												I played a bit of the original and I really like this port. People seem to have a problem with the sound but I think it sounds fine to me from what I've already played and its just nostalgia getting in the way of enjoying this game for what it is on PC for people who have played the original on PS1. What I liked about this re-release is the grammar issues I had with the original are gone from what I've played however the old bad translation is there but at least you get the gist of whats going on. I would have liked a redone translation but I guess I'll wait for the PS4 remake for a better translation. I was happy to know that my 8-9 year old Windows Vista computer is able to play this, it seems to be the only game on steam that can run it just fine. This version offers Character Boosters if you use Cloud Saves (Square Enix Members account needed). This will MAX out your HP, MP, and Gill. This is also for newcommers that want to know the story of Final Fantasy VII.Pros-Its Final Fantasy VII-You dont need a powerful PC to play this.-Grammar errors from the original PS1 translation are gone.-Cloud saves are for newcommers who want to know the full story.Cons-The old bad translation from the PS1 version is still in this version. -Cloud Save barely works sometimes. -You need to log in to Square Enix Members before playing this game for the first time.

												Amazing game. I have played this game for the first time and beaten it shortly before writing this review. So my opinion is non-biased on nostalgia. The game is older, so the graphics, and art style are nothing compared to what is out now, and may be a little jarring at first, it was for me. Soon after getting used to the graphics was an amazing and wonderful experience I wish I had undergone when the game first came out. However, it did not diminish over time. The story is great, even if it is a bit confusing at first, it all falls into place mostly over the course of the game. I did feel there were some plotholes and unexplained points, but nothing too serious. Music is awesome. Definitely some memorable tunes will be stuck in my head for awhile. I enjoyed the turn-based gameplay, and the world map. I highly recommend the game if you have never played it, it will be good to play through the original before the remake comes out, as the original will surely have a special place in your heart.			"

												There's a reason so many people call this the best game of all time. I won't give it that title, but this is the definitive Final Fantasy experience, and it is definitely the one of the best RPGs ever made. It stands right up there with the likes of Chrono Trigger and some of the earlier Final Fantasy games. If you're an RPG fan and you've never played this game, just buy it, you owe it to yourself. I am a highly critical gamer - I nitpick everything and usually don't enjoy many games anymore - but this game charmed me when I played it on the PSX, and it charms me again every time I boot it up on Steam. There just hasn't been an RPG this good since the generation it was made in. If your eyes absolutely cannot handle old-school graphics you may be skeptical, but understand that when this game was released, it was on the top of it's class in that department. So many years later, and no RPG has done what FFVII has done.			"

Even as I play it on a xbox 360 controller; I miss the sounds of a playstation humming in the back ground and the feel of a ps1 controller. I have bought this game on ever platform that it has came out on. This is the best Final Fantasy that I have ever played and have made it a tradition of beating it all the way though and doing all the side quest. This is the game that got me in to gaming and I love it. If you like JRPGs and immersing yourself into a game for 50+ hrs buy this game and I promise you'll love or I won't buy it back from you. Also Final Fantasy 7 will help you with the ladies, but I can't promise you that.			"

												This game is a mixed bag to be honest as it was hard to me to choose if to give it an upvote or downvote. First to talk about the game itself is a not bad port. Nice music better graphics and better difficulty scaling thanks to SquareEnix's new ""Character Booster"" if you are a pickle by scaling your character(s) levels to a point of your prefrence aswell as gil. Pretty much the same as the psx version. HOWEVER the game has a stupid client that FORCES you to make a SQUARE ENIX account which is really pointless to be honest. The controls are really cluncky and are very awkward although you can change them to your prefrences. Also, I do not see the point of achievements for this game. I guess it does provide more playable value but there is really no point getting max gil or max level before the final bosses (And doesn't that achievement collide with the character booster?).In conclusion it is an okay port, if you can get your hands on it get the original because it is much better in my opinion however this game does hold up to the FFVII name. The only real downside is making a square enix account.			"

												Great game, and does justice to the original PS version.  Graphics are slightly better, but all functions from the original game still exist and result in the same spectacular story told in the late 90s.The only con to this game is the lack of controller support; this does not make the game unplayable, but may require a 3rd party software to map the controls to your liking.

												Well what can i say about FFVII well its one of the best games i have every played Fallout 3 beating it, but i trail off, The story of the game is unique and well done this is before the age of ""Quickly shotters are money bags♥♥♥♥♥♥them out"". The story is about Cloud ( you can rename him) and his journey to discover... himself (thats deep) on the way you create friendships with te people you follow anymore would be spoiling this fantastic game. If you havent heard of Final Fantasy you have been living under a rock there are 15 games not including tactics and the others. FF7 is a turn base/real time/random encounter game that has epic music and awesome over sized weapons. The graphics are horrible not going to suger coat it but the rest of the game over shadows it. But alltogeter this game is a must play unless you are not a gamer and all you care about is shotting people.This game is very difficult and the pc controls are bad but you can get used to it, if the game becomes too difficult get a guide book as that will help you thought the game WARNING THE GUIDE BOOK HAS SPOILERS. I love this game SOOOOO MUCH 11/10			"

												This game hardly needs another review. It is quite simply one of the best video games of all time and well worth another look on PC. The mods available for the PC version make it quite worthwhile for any who enjoyed playing it for the PSX. I was a fan back in the day but wondered whether I would enjoy it quite as much--whether I had perhaps overhyped it in my youth. I certainly did not. Final Fantasy VII still stands as a masterpiece almost 20 years later. If you haven't played it yet: you should. If you enjoyed it before you won't regret playing it again on steam. 10/10.			"

												Love this game to death. Mindblowing, heart-stopping nostalgia at every turn for me.Although..When I was little, I had this for PS1..And strangely enough, for some weird reason, I was able to bypass the max HP and MP limits, going up to at least 50k on HP and 1k-2k on MP.And some of the story was different. Warning! Spoiler Below!  In the part where Barret and Cait Sith are going past the weapon that went to Junon, I actually had to fight him before he was shot by the cannon, which is weird.I still to this day do not understand what version of the game I had, but I gotta say, it was still awesome!

												Let's get down to brass tacks: for vets of the series, this is Final Fantasy VII the way you remember it. If you don't have a Playstation or the ability to play this through more ""unscrupulous"" means, by all means this is what you want in a moddable package until the Remake comes out.Now, for you uneducated in the ways of VII, here's the real meat: Final Fantasy VII tells the tale of a ragtag little party initially out to save the Planet from being sucked dry by the Shinra Corporation. Along the way, things go south and blah blah blah even if you haven't played it you know the story with how much Square has thrown into the Compilation of VII. There are some plot twists that most may not know of because of the framing around it, and if you want to know the whole backstory of what led up to the various famous events, you'll find VII to be very accomodating in the way of letting you experience them.This is done by way of various, at the time and even now, enjoyable facets of the ATB battle system. Active Time Battle is just what it sounds like: each character has a bar, it fills up over time, and then you can make your action. If you choose Active for the battle system, enemies can attack while you make your choice. Choose Wait, and action pauses while you do so. This allows you a small degree of customization on the difficulty of the battles, as you can either choose to think your turns through or you can put yourself on the spot by making decisions relatively on the fly when a boss is breathing down your neck.Beyond this lies the Materia system. An extension of the Esper system from VI, Materia function as a condensed way to grant your party magic. As you battle, the Materia grow and develop skills. When mastered they create duplicates, and no skill is tied to one character. You want a scary guy with a gun on his arm dropping meteors? Go ahead and give him Comet. Get the urge to make your meteor dropper the spiky haired blond dude? Take the Comet materia off of the scary guy, give it to spiky dude. Simple as that, but so much more in-depth because of the stat boosts and penalties attached to the materia itself. HP, strength, luck, magic, all affected by the type of materia equipped.The bottom line, barring any moddable issues that other reviews may cover, is this: VII is still as good as it was. Nostalgia goggles are wicked in terms of this game for some people, but as someone who played it at 12 years old then came back 15 years later and played it again? A few times? I still had a major blast with it. If it's on sale, pick it up. If you have a small fortune spare on hand from playing the market? Pick it up then too. It's a long ride, but it's enjoyable.			"

												WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A LIFE STORY: Back in elementry school around the mid 2000's (In high school now) my friends and I would play pretend at recess. We would make up stories and pretend to be characters we made up fighting imaginary bad guys. We had stories that would actually span over a long time. I guess it was kind of like basic LARPing. One day as we we're heading back from recess one of my friends was saying something about new villains that would appear. The only name I remeber hearing and possibly one of the only non made up characters in our game was Sephiroth the One Winged Angel. At the time I had no idea who he was. That is how I was first introduced to Final Fantasy VII. As I was first finding out about it my friend would pretend to be Sephiroth while we fought him as he sang One Winged Angel. I eventualy figured out my friend had discovered Sephiroth was a character from the previously mentioned game Final Fantasy VII. Apparently my friend had discovered it online and developed an obsession with the game and even more so with it's villain Sephiroth despite never having actually played it. As he told me about it he wore off on me and we both became FF7/Sephiroth fanatics. We never played the game but were completley obsessed. I would listen to the one winged angel song multiple times a day and dreamed that some day I might get to play the game. I was also constantly renting the movie that's a sequel to the movie and forcing my older sister (who hated the movie and my obsession) to watch it with me. I forget exactly when but as time went on and I stopped hanging out with that friend due to him moving I stopped caring about it. Before I ever got to play the game my obsession ended. I actually felt kinda ashamed that I was ever obsessed with a game I never played. For a few years the only thing I felt about FFVII was shame for having been so obsessed. Then just this last june I got steam at the advice of some friends. After having it for a little bit I discovered Final Fantasy VII on the steam store. Due to the fact I had heard on the internet that it's a good game and some curiosity left over from my obsession I eventaully decided to get it. I finally did just few weeks ago and my obsession was reborn. This game is freaking AMAZING! I just beat it a couple minutes ago and it normally takes me FOREVER to finish a game! Everything about it is great. The story is great, the battle system is great, the music is great, the bosses are great, the world map is great there isn't anything that isn't great. If you're considering getting this game stop considering. Buy it right now! If you're not intrested in this game at all BUY IT ANYWAY! If you play this game and don't like it THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU! This game gets 11/10.			"

												Game itself is great but there is a big issue which has me wondering wether to give a thumbs up or not as i right this so ill start with what i like.excellent story line, maybe not for everyone but for me quite engrossing some cool twists even if characters would now be considered generic achetypes elsewhere.awsome combat, yes its turn based but the strategy in set5ting up characters with the right gear and meteria abilities is both fun and rewarding.Sephiroth, such an awsome bad guy he deserves a mention of his own, like heath ledgers joker to batman sephiroth is a damn excellent bad guy.although the plot is fairly serious the game contains a great deal of humour and fun moments that will have you laughing out loud.My god the sound track is brilliant, yes its a bit out dated but it still rings through me when sephiroths theme comes on, and that very emotional moment late game its like a bomb going off (im not going to give spoilers)this game is a classic!!!now with the issue, im sure anyone that owns this game will immediately recognise bad gate way error 502. its depressing that this game has DRM turned on and the server or whatever program that governs it is pathetic!!! and means that actually getting to enjoy this game almost ends up coming down to pot luck!!!seems the best work around is to start a square enix account and link your steam account to it which seems to have mainly fixed the issue for mein closing ill go with a thumbs up, the game itself is an age less classic that has echoed through decades and still has fans that have demanded a HD remake so much that square have finally had to give in to the pressure "

												This game is superb. I never had the chance to play this game as a kid and thanks to Steam, I can finally play it. 20 hours in the game and this is the best RPG I have played in years! the story pulls you in and doesn't let you go until you finish, the combat is pretty fun and there is a good variety in attacks and magic spells including summoning, healing, cursing and elemental attacks. the Ultimate attacks achieving at a certain point in battle are nicely made and very well executed despite the limited technology used to create this masterpiece. The world is diverse in many ways, you travel oceans, cities, villages, caves, mines, deserts, hovering theme parks, mountains and many more. There are a lot of side quests to finish and the rewards for finishing them are worth your time if you put hours into finishing a single quest. the variety of monsters to fight is truly jaw dropping and the amount of boss battles each with their own abilities and disadvantages really makes you think of the best way to defeat them. You simply must buy this game and all of its many features and the superb storyline which is both emotional and dark. Once you play this game, you will fall in love with for many years to come			"

												My favourite game of all time (and I just replayed Ocarina of Time to make sure!).  I love this game so much I played and completed all of the main numbered final fantasy titles since playing this on PS1 way back in '97.  This PC port is far better than it was back in the day (on my 486!) and FFVII has never looked better.  The music has now been sorted too and rightly so as this is one of the greatest soundtracks of all time (Aerith's Theme, Cosmo Canyon, One Winged Angel anyone!).In my opinion this game has the perfect mix of steam punk sci-fi and fantasy and has too many memorable scenes and characters to mention here!  The battle and materia systems have also never been beaten for me, in terms of being simultaeneously easy to learn, but allowing for some really satisfying tactical decisions.  This game was amazing at the time and just when you think you've seen it all the summons come along and push the spectacle to new heights.  I think this game has aged pretty well (nostalgia notwithstanding!), but all I can say is if you are an RPG fan you owe it to yourself to check it out!			"

												Attempting to do a perfect game run as I'm writing this review during my holiday. As far as how I'd rate this port, I'd give it a 7/10. You do need to log into a square enix account the first time you load up the game. After that however, you dont need to be connected online to play this game. Just disable cloud saves if you want to play offline. Still a bit annoying you have to do that, but once you do, you should be fine with playing the game.My main issue with this port is that in the PS1 version, battle menus ran 60fps, which made slot limit breaks smooth. In this version, menus match the fps of battles, which mean they'll also be 15fps. You can feel it's a little slow compared to the ps1 version when one of your characters reaches a limit break and your bar, while moving up fast, feels more choppy compared to the ps1 version. Some of the mini games are also cut to 30 fps instead of the ps1 60 fps counterpart, such as the speed square and the snowboard mini game. Now I hear that there are fixes for this, but in return, your steam achievements for FF7 will not work, so in the end you have to decide whether it's worth it to sacrifice your achievements or put up with the slowdowns in this game. Other than that though, this is still an outstanding classic for you to play, and even with those issues I mentioned, I ended up getting used to them after awhile. I really do like the achievements in this game too. All in all, I really do recommend this game if you're thinking about playing it, but if you want to have the best version of ff7, I would suggest playing it on PS1.			"

												This is probably my favorite Final Fantasy game. It's perfect for starters in my opinion. It starts you right in action, and really dosen't have many in game tutorials. I think the music is great, and didn't really mind that it had old graphics. You can also get mods to improve the music and the character models. The game is not too hard and not too easy. Games like Pokemon sometimes require you to grind. This one I feel like I didn't, but then I didn't figure out how to escape battles until I got very late in the game.			"

												There's a reason so many people call this the best game of all time. I won't give it that title, but this is the definitive Final Fantasy experience, and it is definitely the one of the best RPGs ever made. It stands right up there with the likes of Chrono Trigger and some of the earlier Final Fantasy games. If you're an RPG fan and you've never played this game, just buy it, you owe it to yourself. I am a highly critical gamer - I nitpick everything and usually don't enjoy many games anymore - but this game charmed me when I played it on the PSX, and it charms me again every time I boot it up on Steam. There just hasn't been an RPG this good since the generation it was made in. If your eyes absolutely cannot handle old-school graphics you may be skeptical, but understand that when this game was released, it was on the top of it's class in that department. So many years later, and no RPG has done what FFVII has done.			"

												Writing a review about FF7 without letting the nostalgia goggles get in the way is difficult. This is a game that I picked up in 1998 or 1999 after seeing a friend play it at his house. I immediately fell in love with it. It's immersive, the music is amazing, and the Materia system changed how people view equipment in RPGs. The game is constantly moving, and as you progress through the game you really gain an appreciation for every area you've explored through.I'm not someone to tell you to play an NES game in the year 2014. Old games do not age well. However, they did a really good job of freshening up FF7 for a PC re-release, and if you don't play this game then it's my opinion that you're missing out on the greatest RPG of all-time.			"

												FF7 is amazing, I played it first in 2009 due to somehow missing it back in the 90's, and it STILL blew me away. It's got incredible production values for the time it was made.However, I do not suggest the Steam version. The MIDI tracks sound terrible and the soundtrack's completely butchered because of it. I don't recommend the older PC release either, as the game simply doesn't work on recent operating systems.The best way to play this is the actual PS1 copy, or the PSN store versions. The second best way is to play the old release on Windows XP, with a ""combat models while out-of-combat"" mod.Avoid FF8 like the plague unless you're a full-blown weeaboo with a child's understanding of story-writing.

												This has got to be up there as one of my favorite RPG's of all time. It's certainly up there on my list of all time great games aswell. Its one of the few games from years ago that I can play these days and not get bothered about the graphics. The story line is amazing, totally original back then and still not repeated now. Not forgetting some very impressive characters. The battles and enemies are varied. There are quite a few battles that require a real strategy. Unless you use a guide and follow it word for word, you will be able to play it through over and over and still find new things about the game. The mini games and side quests can keep you entertained for hours on end.You can put in 30 hours or 100 hours in a single run, its completely down to how you feel during that play through.This game has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. In a way it makes the game and adds to the story. The bad thing is this steam version does not have the high quality version of the soundtrack which does take something away from the game. A petition is being done at the moment and at 1100+ players at the time of wriiting this has been sent to the owners who say they are looking into it. If they do change it and update this version then I would give it 10 out of 10!			"

												Same game I played back in the 90s... over and over again.  I never stopped playing this game.  It made sense to get the Steam version so I could have easy access to the game and various PC mods for it.This is not a port of the PSX version!  It is a patched version of the old PC port from the 90s with Steam achievements and non-Steam cloud saves and controller support.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The game worked fairly well back in the day.  However, Square should be ashamed of such a lazy re-release.  There should have been more work put into extra features and graphical enhancements.  There are some mods for tweaking the graphics, but I would still enjoy some official love.Overall, the game is only worth getting if you never played the original version or have nostalgic feelings toward FF7 like I have.  Wait for a sale if you can.  I've seen the game sell for $4.			"

												This was my first FF game, so I didn't know what to expect. I started it and I saw some ludicrous character models that made me question what I just bought. But soon after getting into the game I was gripped. The gameplay is solid and easily beats any 2017 AAA game. The music is great and it never gets tiresome, it makes playing for hours feel like minutes. But the one thing that stands out is the story. Unlike most games, the story in FFVII is very interesting and unpredictable. There's a good variety of characters that become quite memorable after you spend some time playing. Before I got into the game, I expected cheesy dialogue and a kid-friendly story, but the game is far from that. The story and dialogue are made for everyone, but only adults understand the full story. The only problem I've noticed is the controller compability, but that can be easily fixed with the ""JoyToKey"" application which you can download for free online. It's totally worth the setting up because the game is unbearable with a keyboard in my opinion. Overall this is a timeless 10/10. I recommend it to everyone.			"

												This game changed my standards for videogames. It is by far the best RPG I have ever played if you have the opportunity to buy this game I highly recommend it. It takes roughly 50 hours to beat the main story without guides or whatever the game was entirely worth every minute I put into it. The soundtrack is surprisingly good. A lot of people will say ""ZOMG THIS GAEM HAS THE BEST MUSICS IVE EVER HEARD HOLY TOLEDO"" no seriously though, this music is catchy, it perfectly portrays every emotion it is supposed to capture and it will make you feel exactly how you should during every scene of the game. Also the combat system is unique and captivating, it is much like its predecessors with the whole timed wait for using your next move and whatnot except this time if you get hit enough you get a limit break for each character with which they will unleash an intensely powerful barage of moves that do loads of damage and make you feel very powerful. This game influenced many games' leveling systems for spells and what have you and with good reason. Buy this game when you get the chance you won't regret it.			"

												I didn't play this game in my childhood unlike most people that I know, but instead I started playing Final Fantasy titles aged about 23. I kept arguing with my boyfriend that I couldn't handle the graphics for FFVII and would wait for a remake before attempting to play it (I had tried the PS3 port) but he kept telling me it would never be remade...I finally picked up the game in a sale in Spring 2015 having come to the conclusion that it would never get a remake and I'd just have to deal with the blocky graphics. I played it, and fell in love with it - the story, the characters and the music.The day after I completed the game we were watching the stream of Sony's E3 conference... I cried a little, fell off the sofa and still to this day am a little convinced that I must have caused the remake to be announced. "

												Keep in mind, this is a very short review. I am going to give an opinion of the game but I wont go into depth becuase I am sure I would end up leaving something out even if I sat here for 7 hours trying to write the review, so here it is:This game is one of the best games I have ever played, if not the absolute best. Nostalgia is not a factor here what so ever as I first played this game last year after buying it during the holiday sale. This game is NOT overhyped by any means, don't let someone's opinion of that prevent you from playing this game. It was amazing when it first released and it is amazing now. The music is perfect and fits every situation in the game while sounding great. The story is better than almost any I have ever experienced in a work of fiction, including novels and movies. The graphics are simple, but because they are stylized I like the way the game looks anyway, simple does not always equal bad. If you love turn-based gameplay, the you will love this game. If you don't like turn-based gameplay, you might warm up to it after this game. Having three chracters with an ""Active Time"" system makes the battles fast paced and forces you to think quickly. The materia system will you an extreme amount of freedom when playing, allowing you to have characters act similarly to any Final Fantasy class type. Or you could just make them unique, they don't have to mirror any class if you want them too. Combos of many different types are possible with the materia system as well. The characters in this game are some of the most well done, multi-dimetional characters I have ever seen in a work of fiction. Both the chracters and story end up being so complex (without being messy) that to this day people still have heated debates on them. This game also has a habit of making unforgettable moments for the player, but for obvious reason I wont state examples. There is so much more to this game, but as I said before, I am not going to make this a long review.This game is a perfect 10 out of 10, you really should play it. Also Cloud Strife, the main character of this game, is now going to be in Super Smash Brothers 4. That's pretty cool.			"

												Final Fantasy 7 is (obviously) the seventh entry in the numerical series of the Final Fantasy game. Throughout the game you play as Cloud Strife, ex-soldier, with your party made up of Tifa, Barret, Cait Sith, Vincent, Red XIII, Aeris and Cid (I'm pretty sure that's everyone, apologies here if there are more).The game is split up into three parts, however Part 2 and 3 are considerably shorter than Part 1:The main quest in Part 1 is around 12-14 hours The main quest in Part 2 is around 4-6 hoursThe main quest in Part 3 is around 30 mins-2 hours.I'll split this review into four parts (the first three parts being about the game with the last part being about anything else such as music).PART 1:Part 1 opens with you playing as Cloud on an AVALANCE mission (AVALANCE is the eco-terrorist group in the game who is at a constant battle with Shin'ra). Cloud starts off as being tough and only really cares about the money he'll get from this mission which makes him start off being somewhat unlikable-which in this game isn't a neccacarly bad thing and Cloud becomes very likable after the first AVALANCE mission in the game. Throughout Part 1 your party will be made up of Cloud, Barret, Tifa, Aeris, Cait Sith and Red XIII. Part 1 goes at a steady pace with the story becoming very intriguing as you go through the game.The bosses in Part 1 are very easy to defeat WHICH wouldn't be a problem however considering you'll be spending the majority of your adventure on Part 1, even if you're just going through the main quest, it'll make you at first feel powerful which is great however it soon becomes tiresome.The ending of Part 1 is considered one of the most amazing twists in video game history-however I would disagree as throughout Part 1 the twist was constantly foreshadowed, such as when you first meet Cait Sith (whose twist I view as being greater than the ending of Part 1).One of the most ridiculous parts in Part 1 is the story explaining why Barret's hand has been replaced with a gun instead. I have no problem with the backstory about his missing hand and found what happened with Dyne and Barret very touching. Although I have no problem with Dyno killing people for no apparent reason this part has annoyed me for two reasons, one of which because he can and the second of which is didn't have that much to do with the main story, this could easily have been explained as a side quest. All in all Part 1 was a very entertaining segment of this amazing game.PART 2:Part 2 of Final Fantasy 7 is when the game kind of goes off the rails (in a bad way though this doesn't stop the enjoyment). In this part you will have other members added to your party-such as Cid. Part 2 holds two of my favorite scenes-one which explains the truth of when Sepheroth set fire to Nebliehem and also the truth about Cloud, unfortunately these two events weren't enough to put Final Fantasy 7 back on the rails.In the first half of Part 2 the boss fights are fairly easy, just like in part 1 however half way through things become a little more interesting and the boss fights becoming harder and harder, with the fight between your party and Hojo being the 2nd hardest of the game.A lot of the time in Part 2 you play as the other members of your party-such as Tifa so that way you don't get bored of Cloud just yet. There are several interesting mini games-such the snow boarding segment of Part 2 which  I would argue is perhaps the best part of the game-would have been great if there were similar segments incorporating into the main story! Unfortunately there are perhaps more bad minigames than good-such as the tower defense and submarine mini games. I was looking forward to the tower defense mini game however this was ruined by its slow pace, even when sped up and I found the controls for the submarine mini game to be too clumsy and the mini game was too easy, even for my liking.PART 3:Part 3 of the game is very short-the main story not being that long (it's only really the fight between your party and Sephiroth) with the rest being made up of end-game content. The final boss fight is fantastic-it's long and hard (and as such the hardest fight in the game). It is the only one of two boss battles which requires you to use your brain (the other boss fight being Hojo). Unfortunately the game's ending offered nothing interesting-not even a twist (even a very crappy twist would have made me slightly more happy) however this is very small compared to the feeling you get after the defeat of Sephiroth.PART 4:In this final part I will talk about things such as music and graphics. The music of the game is very beautiful at first however the repetitiveness of it makes me want to stab knives through my ears-it could work as great torture tactics perhaps (take note MI6), there isn't that much variety with music at all, the same would be with the sound, not that much variety.This is of course a port of the original game released for the PS1 so I won't say much about the graphics (besides-graphics don't make a game). The game is very dramatic so it makes you wonder why the graphics is the way it is (which makes the game not seem very dramatic) instead of graphics similar to the resident evil games, however the games graphics does work and is what makes the game what it is in my opinion.There is many materia in the game, which makes up the spells and abilities your party has and also may take away or increase some of your attributes such as HP and MP which becomes very important as you get towards the end of Part 2, so pick your materia wisely!The weapon models used in the game are interesting and aren't the same model retextured over and over again unlike in most games which gives each weapon its own kind of feel. Despite there being plenty of weapons to chose from in the begging of the game, as you go further into the game you realise there isn't that much variety at all.My second-to final complaint about this game would be the ""class system"". The game somewhat has a classless system due to the use of materia-which allows you to give spells and summons to characters though it feels like you must give each character a certain materia due to they way they're presented with their weapons or limit breaks-an example being Aeris. One of her limit breaks ""healing wand"" heals all of your party members which make syou feel like you must give her materia which will give her healing kind of spells.My final complaint is very small however it does make the game very annoying and this would be summoning. I do enjoy the summoning in the game however after every battle you can summon the summon(s) you used in the previous battle which means you may be able to get through several parts of the game easily and their animations are long which can somewhat annoy you later on in the game when you'll be using summoning a lot.Despite my complaints-I found the game to be very interesting and is perhaps the best game I've ever played. I would recommend this game to anyone looking to get into the final fantasy series, looking for a very dramatic game or want a game which is great even by today standards which could run on a low end computer! However I would not recommend this for RPG fans due to the linear game play which makes the game feel more like a high fantasy turn based adventure game rather than an RPG.			"

												""Overrated"" Is a term people seem to throw around a lot these days. The more I hear it, the more I realize what an empty, vain and pathetic thing it is to have so little bad to say about something that instead you have to resort to devaluing everyone else's praise for it. Once I really got into it I thought to myself ""Damn whoever caled this overrated for the millionth time, who steered me away from this gem with a criticism not even able to really say anything about the games faults, and damn me for being dumb enough to listen to such an empty claim"" This game has faults, yes, but none of them make it any less of a great game.FF7 is one of many masterpieces to be plagued with these claims of being ""overrated"" I have never played the original, I was never touched by the nostalgia, I do not think it is the best game or even the best RPG game. But hell, it deserves the praise it gets through and through. Like many other entries in the FF series, it has an amazing, unique battle system that is fun to test and level up in, a good story with plenty of shockers, feeling and depth, not to mention the godly soundtrack. I give this game a 9.5/10 easily, and provided the remake isn't chock full of DLC and other money grabs I will be getting that as soon as I can. "

												I've loved Final Fantasy VII for years, I still have the discs for the fist play station. Am I ecstatic that they put it on steam??  Do you even have to ask???  For those of you that have never played any Final Fantasy games, I totally recommend that you try this one first.  The graphics are the same as they were on playstation if there are any of you that are like me and remember the game.  Steam also has a guide for all of those hiding potions,GFs, etc... and guides you through.  The only change that I've seen so far of couse are that you use the keyboard keys instead of the playstation controller.  The keyboard keys are not hard at all and pretty well lined up. I would recommend this game to anyone young or old, because   even back in it's newest days it had an awesome story line.  I have yet to see a game come even close to this game's story line.  The story line,and the fact that in many parts of the game you are free to go run around the map and level are  two of the best things about this lovely turn-based rpg.  There are many other good things about it but I'd rather not spoil anything for you.  Happy Gaming!  I know it'll be a happy gaming day for me for sure!			"

												Keep in mind, this is a very short review. I am going to give an opinion of the game but I wont go into depth becuase I am sure I would end up leaving something out even if I sat here for 7 hours trying to write the review, so here it is:This game is one of the best games I have ever played, if not the absolute best. Nostalgia is not a factor here what so ever as I first played this game last year after buying it during the holiday sale. This game is NOT overhyped by any means, don't let someone's opinion of that prevent you from playing this game. It was amazing when it first released and it is amazing now. The music is perfect and fits every situation in the game while sounding great. The story is better than almost any I have ever experienced in a work of fiction, including novels and movies. The graphics are simple, but because they are stylized I like the way the game looks anyway, simple does not always equal bad. If you love turn-based gameplay, the you will love this game. If you don't like turn-based gameplay, you might warm up to it after this game. Having three chracters with an ""Active Time"" system makes the battles fast paced and forces you to think quickly. The materia system will you an extreme amount of freedom when playing, allowing you to have characters act similarly to any Final Fantasy class type. Or you could just make them unique, they don't have to mirror any class if you want them too. Combos of many different types are possible with the materia system as well. The characters in this game are some of the most well done, multi-dimetional characters I have ever seen in a work of fiction. Both the chracters and story end up being so complex (without being messy) that to this day people still have heated debates on them. This game also has a habit of making unforgettable moments for the player, but for obvious reason I wont state examples. There is so much more to this game, but as I said before, I am not going to make this a long review.This game is a perfect 10 out of 10, you really should play it. Also Cloud Strife, the main character of this game, is now going to be in Super Smash Brothers 4. That's pretty cool.			"

												I didn't play this game in my childhood unlike most people that I know, but instead I started playing Final Fantasy titles aged about 23. I kept arguing with my boyfriend that I couldn't handle the graphics for FFVII and would wait for a remake before attempting to play it (I had tried the PS3 port) but he kept telling me it would never be remade...I finally picked up the game in a sale in Spring 2015 having come to the conclusion that it would never get a remake and I'd just have to deal with the blocky graphics. I played it, and fell in love with it - the story, the characters and the music.The day after I completed the game we were watching the stream of Sony's E3 conference... I cried a little, fell off the sofa and still to this day am a little convinced that I must have caused the remake to be announced. "

												Great game with excellent combat mechanics and a very engaging story, Although the translation isn't the best and the graphics really haven't aged well at all. It's a good thing it's really very easy to mod the game by downloading a new set of fully (fan made) remastered music. You can also get new character models for the game which is highly recommended. just check the steam guides on how to do this and where to get the files you need!			"

												""Overrated"" Is a term people seem to throw around a lot these days. The more I hear it, the more I realize what an empty, vain and pathetic thing it is to have so little bad to say about something that instead you have to resort to devaluing everyone else's praise for it. Once I really got into it I thought to myself ""Damn whoever caled this overrated for the millionth time, who steered me away from this gem with a criticism not even able to really say anything about the games faults, and damn me for being dumb enough to listen to such an empty claim"" This game has faults, yes, but none of them make it any less of a great game.FF7 is one of many masterpieces to be plagued with these claims of being ""overrated"" I have never played the original, I was never touched by the nostalgia, I do not think it is the best game or even the best RPG game. But hell, it deserves the praise it gets through and through. Like many other entries in the FF series, it has an amazing, unique battle system that is fun to test and level up in, a good story with plenty of shockers, feeling and depth, not to mention the godly soundtrack. I give this game a 9.5/10 easily, and provided the remake isn't chock full of DLC and other money grabs I will be getting that as soon as I can. "

												I've loved Final Fantasy VII for years, I still have the discs for the fist play station. Am I ecstatic that they put it on steam??  Do you even have to ask???  For those of you that have never played any Final Fantasy games, I totally recommend that you try this one first.  The graphics are the same as they were on playstation if there are any of you that are like me and remember the game.  Steam also has a guide for all of those hiding potions,GFs, etc... and guides you through.  The only change that I've seen so far of couse are that you use the keyboard keys instead of the playstation controller.  The keyboard keys are not hard at all and pretty well lined up. I would recommend this game to anyone young or old, because   even back in it's newest days it had an awesome story line.  I have yet to see a game come even close to this game's story line.  The story line,and the fact that in many parts of the game you are free to go run around the map and level are  two of the best things about this lovely turn-based rpg.  There are many other good things about it but I'd rather not spoil anything for you.  Happy Gaming!  I know it'll be a happy gaming day for me for sure!			"

												its a classic rpg game from the playstation days. i can't tell you how many times i've played this on console. i still own my copy somewhere and decided i wanted to buy it for the pc. this game really set the stage for some of the rpgs at the time. yes i know there were others as well but this isn't a review for those. while this was not my favorite FF it a great game. i remembered every moment on the game. even on this playthrough i forgot how unforgiving Sepheroth can be and i made a few mistakes. still that never changed how i feel about that game.still funny to this day i've never beat ruby or emerald weapon but i also never had the time to get to that point. one day.anyways this is well worth the pickup if you loved final fantasy.

												I first played this game when I was 12. I remember spending most nights either manically grinning at how cool the game and graphics were, or heartbroken by bit of storyline. I had the guide (lost in a move sadly), and its what made me turn from my megadrive to the pc for gaming.Flash forward to 15 year later, when I see this for sale and think I will re-live the good old days. I have a family and work, so I'm still playing late at night, only difference is now I'm not being naughty up past my bed time. That being said there have been nights when my wife has walked in and I almost jumped out of my skin, thats how hard the nostalgia has hit me.FFVII has some of the best characters, and is an amazing story. The only downside is the graphics which for a 19 year old game are pretty awesome, but thats not saying much by todays standards.The remake is supposedly on its way, but I am wary about the innevitably changes and how it could taint my memories. That being said I will probably give it a go, but if you havent played the game, or like me you played it years ago I would recommend having another go now!TLDR:Re-live your childhood, or set it right with what you missed. This is easily my favourite game of all time. Just don't expect ground breaking graphics.10/10 would be 12 again.			"

												Despite my coming to the party 18 years late, Final Fantasy VII was one of my favourite games I played in 2015. Expecting greatness when I went in, I tried my best not to get immersed in it thinking it was good because of all the universal praise it gets; it didn't take long for me to realize I didn't have to, because I could see it for myself.Before I get to the actual meat and potatoes part of this review, looking at the negative reviews, I see a lot of criticism towards Square Enix about having to make a Squenix account in order to play, which is understandable in 2016 with a lot of people being very protective of their information (seeing as some personal information is mandatory to sign up, if I remember correctly). If you're so worried about this, I recommend you read more about it, because if I'm going to be honest, I'm not familiar with what Square Enix can and can't do with what you give them. If you don't want to support Squenix, I don't want to support piracy, but you should put some thought into it.I'm also going to make it clear that this is the only Final Fantasy game I've ever played; if you've played other games in the series and are looking for a comparison, this guide is likely not for you. Final Fantasy VII is thought of universally as one of the best RPGs, or even one of the best video games of all time, and while I'm not sure how much I agree with that, I can definitely stand by the claim that the majority of its praise is well deserved.The characters are all memorable, creative and unique, and are personal enough to make you care about what happens to them and the world around them. The dialogue between them is excellent, and portrays a great level of personality and emotion, and creates great relationships such as the passive-aggressive friendship between Cloud and Barret, and how Yuffie is seen as the immature Materia loving ninja girl always looking for a fight.The 85-song soundtrack is incredible, with songs that portray emotion and songs that portray anger, or a sense of adventure, or a feeling of despair, anxiousness, being back in your hometown, any song you'd expect in a dramatic RPG, just done better, and made to work on PlayStation 1 hardware, no less (although I don't really know how all that works). And if you enjoy it as much as I do, I recommend you listen to the official Final Fantasy VII - Piano Collections album (Cinco de Chocobo and Tifa's Theme are my favourites).The graphics, in all honesty, have NOT aged well; the pixelated battle backgrounds, while revolutionary for their time and still a nice touch today are not amazing visually, but in terms of the blocky and polygonal model appearances and the repetitive shrug, anger and disappointment animations used for nearly every character with a humanoid build, they're charming in a sense, in the same way people look at the 30+ year old Super Mario Bros. Mario sprite. And if the PS1 style graphics bother you that much, there are indeed graphical mods out there (although I couldn't tell you much about them, I've never used any).Despite being a typical RPG, the gameplay is fresh and exciting, even going into it today. The Materia system, in which you attach magic-based attacks, monster summons, or bonuses like HP Plus or Magic Plus makes the entire magic system more interesting and complex, and the unique 'ATB' battle system allows for real-time RPG combat as opposed to turn-based (although this can be configured in the game's settings; if this is your first Final Fantasy game you might want to read about ATB because it can be confusing at first; I actually jumped into this game expecting turn-based and was surprised when the enemy would attack me in the middle of a menu. If this is not for you, look into the options menu.) Limit breaks keep the battles interesting and can quickly turn the tide of a losing battle, used by filling the Limit Gauge which fills the more damage you take (but make note this is far from a crutch to help a bad player.) And the last thing I'm going to mention, but far from the least important, is the story; while complicated and sometimes unnecessarily complex, the story of Final Fantasy VII is a long roller-coaster of surprise and drama, involving AVALANCHE's quest to stop Shinra Headquarters, Sephiroth's rampage and plot to kill the world, black materia, lifestream, Mako energy, among many other subjects.Branching storylines include Cloud's conflict with his real self, Barret's disappointment in himself for failing to protect his hometown, and many other unique and dramatic storylines within the game. It's honestly a lot to keep track of and remember, and even harder to write about, but the point I'm making is that the story is never lacking in any places and you never feel as if what you're doing has no important outcome or consequence; I was thoroughly entertained without the game, which I honestly didn't expect; I expected to play it continously every day for maybe an hour, but I would spend days playing in 6-hour periods, which is something I rarely do for any game I enjoy, just to see what would end up happening because of the actions I took in the past.In terms of things I wasn't pleased with or I feel could have been done better, I feel like I need to make note that the story is pretty hard to follow at times, and it can be hard to lose track of what you're doing and why you're doing it, but this might just be a personal thing.On the topic of cons, this game has a lot of unnecessary minigames, and I mean a LOT of them. What makes this worse is that this port of Final Fantasy VII, while completely functional and complete with Cloud saving (heh), if you're playing on a keyboard, the game is not set to recognize what button you have to what input, so if you're being instructed to press a key, it will say [CANCEL] for example instead of [X]. This goes the same way no matter what kind of controller you're using; a friend of mine played it on a GameCube controller.Back on the topic of minigames, I'm having Vietnam flashbacks remembering a marching minigame in which you have to press the keys it asks for (which you might not be familiar with because it doesn't tell you which letter on the keyboard), and other similar minigames in this vein. There's an unnecessary amount that honestly could just be changed into a cutscene, such as a slap-fight between Tifa and the female Turk (although this one was actually kinda funny), a squat battle (you heard me), pushing barrels onto Shinra soldiers who are chasing Aeris (or Aerith ♥♥♥♥ you), among others. Some of them are fun for the most part, but generally speaking I feel like they're just wasting my time, but I appreciate the effort to give the user some control.But despite the game's problems, I would recommend Final Fantasy VII to anybody in a heartbeat. TL;DR, the characters are unique and personal, the music sounds spectaular and works great with the game, the story makes you care and keeps you involved, and the gameplay is nothing you've seen before. I would recommend this for full price.[this is the part where i don't know how to close a review]			"

												A classic.  Chances are if you're buying this you've played it already.  If not, well you'll get to see what all us thirty-somethings are talking about.  There are options to run at a higher resolution and dither the textures and stuff like that... but there isn't much point.  This game has polygons and fmv's and whatnot - but it's really born from a 16-bit era design philosophy.  Keep that in mind while playing - it's more about the story than the presentation - and that story is a parable for the true struggle of our age, which is why it resonates with so many people.  The irony here is that Squenix is behaving more and more like the evil corporation in its cautionary tale...Worth the 40 or so hours, I say.  Get it.  Run it at low rez.  Punch Square-Enix in the face for big-brothering you before letting you play.  (An account is required!)  Wish you had just kept your Playstation and curse the death of privacy.  Square:  Either you die Squaresoft... or you live long enough to see yourself become Square-Enix...			"

												The music in this horror of a port is MIDI quality, it has no controller support, there's very limited language options, and even the hand-painted backgrounds are compressed to ugly blocky messes.  A really sad waste of money when all I wanted was to enjoy FFVII again :_(   If you heard about how amazing someone thought this game was, please don't judge it by this lazy hack job ... Do Not Buy.			"

												This is a game I try to play annually. I have to say it is one of those games with a special place in my heart. I grew up playing this game. I am glad to see that it has become available on steam as my old playstation and playstation copy have become worn out and broken. Being able to play with Cloud Strife and crew again is such a wonderful nostalgia. Though the sad reality of the graphics getting on in age is such a tragedy. This game getting a complete remake instead of a spit and polish job would bring this Final Fantasy fan to his knees in joy. But alas, despite all the rumors and hints from fans and Square that never turn out to be factual. I feel this game will never get the true remake/remastering it deserves.Update: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Is it true?! Can it be?! The new remake has come. I pray to the gods of gaming that the news is true this time.			"

												I will admit I never, repeat, NEVER completed a Final Fantasy game before and the only one I remember seeing all the way to the end was the first Final Fantasy on the Playstation (My sister beat the game.) Due to me being sheltered for so long from the begining era of the PS2, I barely heard about this game for a long time.But when I heard that this game was being parodied by my favorite YouTube channel Team Four Star, I thought it looked interesting. And I seem very interested in the remake trailer since everyone was wanting a remake for so long.I had some money leftover in Steam. I suddenly saw FF7 for purchase on it. I figured what the heck, and bought it.I'm afraid to say that it's the greatest RPG of all time because all kinds of people have different tastes. What are my thoughts?Nothing but amazing.The story is pretty good with some touches of things from other types of media. Combining action, peril, slight love, comedy, and drama, but most of all, character build up. Cloud seemed to be a perfect example. I will admit that this game is NOT easy and will require lots of stradegy in order to get from the begining to the very end. However it is worth it with it's dark story that with these characters fills you with hope as well as a fantastic soundtrack.The only flaws is that there seem to be no way to use specific controllers without using mods. I had to download a specific mod to make this game compatible with my 360 controller.I hope the remake is just as good as this orignal. Now I'm interested in hunting down all the other Final Fantasy games that I missed out on.			"

												It's the good old PS1 classic from late 90's in the form of a good pc port. Many people, including me, know it as one of the best RPGs ever done or maybe the best of all time. The one that started it all. I think it was my first big RPG/JRPG I ever played, when I was 10 years old.Simply put, it's a masterpiece. The story, characters, world, gameplay like Materia-system + turn-based combat and soundtrack are what make this game really memorable throughout the years. Nobuo Uematsu is a wizard when it comes to making game soundtracks. Even though this is one of the older games that does not have voice acting, the fantastic music is one huge part that makes the world feel alive and give you emotions. It's still perhaps the greatest OST ever made for games imo. And it is always nice to imagine how the characters sound like when had no VA.I still enjoy replaying it, be it for the nostalgia or something else and it's been almost 20 years since original release. FFVII is one of those timeless classics, like MGS1, that never gets old :).Those who never had the chance to play FFVII back in the days, if you can get past the old graphics (characters look funny I know), you will find a very special experience that won't disappoint. Some cutscenes show more detailed characters. If you don't want to wait for the upcoming FFVII:Remake, give this one a try.			"

												This is the game that stole my teenage years and one of the few I don't look back at and say ""I want my time back"", because it changed a part of me.The story, although confusing, also resonates well with today's world problems and I believe there couldn't be a better time for the upcoming remake. You will laugh. You will cry. And when you complete it you will be happier than ever for that measely 12$ you spent for this experience, because it's one you won't get anywhere else.Do you want to try a good japanese style RPG but don't know where to start? Buy this game.Do you want to relive the game and don't mind outdated graphics? Buy it.Do you want to play the game but live for graphics rather than gameplay and story? Wait for the remake.Do you hate Final Fantasy? If yes, you're fired.Why is this game good, you say? Why is it being remade? This should explain it all.

												This was a big game on the Playstation, but nothing is updated at all.  The timing is all messed up and stuff pops around and is not even as smooth as the 1990 playstation graphics were.  This will make you feel bad about the old FF7 that you love, so just remember the good old days and don't buy this one.  They also have you register with square for the DRM, as if Steam wasn't enough protection for a dead game that no additional work was done on.  I got the impression that they brought this game up to the times from the description, but that is totally false.  If you are considering this, you might as well wait untill Square does a true remake like they always do with their old games since you will have to buy the game again afterwards to play it.  Another sell out of goodwill for profit.  You will do better to get some old Playstation at a yard sale and pick up a true copy of FF7 for $0.97 and play that.			"

												FF7 is a true classic.  Though it was made in Square's golden era, Square is about as bad as they come nowadays.  I'm not here to bag on Square though...I'm here to bag on the worst gamepad support I've ever seen in a game.  Using a Logitech 310...will not work.  Can't configure it through their crappy ""joystick"" setup (who uses joysticks anymore?  What is this, 1989 NES era?)  There's tons of support on Square's site that leads to dead ends.  Tbh, the game works better on an emulator or an original PS1.  Oh, and you have to sign into a Square account (despite this being Steam).  Why this is even let on Steam in the current state, I have no idea.  It's like they took a steaming dump on one of the greatest games I've ever played.			"

												Firstly, my rating: 9/10This game is all together flawless. Aside from the simple nostalgia of going back to my first and favorite RPG, the game, in itself, is amazing. The combat system is tweaked from the previous, 2-D Final Fantasies, and while it could be argued that the protagonist in the game can be whiny a good amount of the time (And I will not argue that), I personally feel it adds to his character. This is only a review, so I won't post that whole rant here, but overall, he's actually my favorite protagonist of all the series.The ONLY flaw, and the only reason this is a 9/10, rather than 10/10, is that the steam version does not allow the HD patch that is available. Valve Anti-Cheat will strip you of all your achievements for the game if you install it, which is unfortunate. The game is a solid 10/10 for me, I would always recommend you at least try the title, even if the other games were not to your liking, and I'm docking a single point for this STEAM review as Valve Anti-Cheat is a pain for this game.Cheers			"

												Welcome to the past!  Sexy, sexy polygons.  Final Fantasy VII plays through your emotions by telling an intricate story about life, love, loss, confusion, revenge, and death.  The simple (almost lego) character models provided a challenge that we don't really worry about these days: The characters had to express emotions using body language (no facial expressions).  [Slight spoiler incoming] You can literally see the rage coursing through Barrett as he watches his hometown get destroyed.  I find this form of expression refreshing compared to the perfectly rendered expressions in videogames these days.  It makes it a bit difficult to empathize sometimes. But do your best- it's worth it!Also, the polygons and twisty winding maps leave a LOT to the imagination- which is a good thing.  Imagination is a form of thought that games have been slowly eliminating through our advances in detail.  That's not to say I wouldn't want this game to be remade in beautiful stunning detail- I'm all for it!  It would be like reading a book -then watching the movie and saying, ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ they cast Ender PERFECTLY!!""  -rather than skipping the book, watching the movie and thinking it had some cool concepts~The real beauty in the game is a combination of the writer's inspiration and what they had to work with.  The writers poured their hearts into making this game- they had no idea it would be such a hit.  All they had were crummy PS1 graphics to work with, but they did what they could hoping people would like it.  Nowadays, game devs have more than enough money and the writers are getting less and less passionate because of it.  The Final Fantasy franchise has been going pretty strong and can still give me a good cry sometimes.  But why was 7 such a hit?  I'm thinking it was sincerity.Something else that comes to mind is how the mini games weave into the standard gameplay like they ARE the standard gameplay.  A player is expected to adapt on the fly~  One moment you're fighting in a turn based system, then suddenly you're on a motorcycle swatting baddies on either side!  Don't forget snowboarding, chocobo races, and other golden saucer attractions!  -----------------------SPOILER ALERT - personal feelingsFirst time through (I'm talking 12 years old), I put all my time into Aeris.

												This game changed my life as a child, as a 5 or 6 year old watching my dad play through and trying to follow him on my own save file,  this was probably the first *real* game I ever played.  This game and Zelda: Ocarina of Time define my childhood and set me on the path of gaming for the rest of my life.The storyline is deep and rich and complex but still makes perfect sense, which is more than can be said about later entries in the series (FF13 I'm looking at you)  The graphics might be obviously dated but this game has established itself as an all time classic.  You will not regret purchasing this game if you didn't get the chance to play it on the PSX.  I've personally completed this game maybe 20 or 30 times.  And still play it now almost 20 years later at least once a year.  Graphics (for their time) 8/10Game play:  9/10Storyline:  10/10The grind: 8/10  you level up well with the story but not enough to make the game too easy.  The materia system is by far my favorite magic system in any FF title, it's almost as much fun trying to max out each one as it is playing the rest of the game.  Think getting a lv100 pokemon but even better.over all, and considering this game as stood up to the test of time for TWENTY YEARS,  I'd rate it 10/10 and not ironically or satirically.  I really mean it, this game is so god damn powerful and if you're younger it'll change your life playing it for the first time.Enjoy			"

												The reason why most of us buy this game is for nostalgia. That said, this game has not been improved since the PC version first came out ~1998. The graphics have not been updated (Though there are mods you can use if you are okay with turning off Steam Achievements), and the controls are pretty outdated (zxc for buttons). This game may be better with a controller, however.Be advised, you are buying essentially the same version as the ps1 original disc with achievements. If that is your deal, go for it.			"

												I've played FF7 on PS1 long long time ago... and it was already one of my favorite RPGs (FF6 and Suikoden 1 and 2 being the best of them). I wanted to play this game again since I've watched FF7 Advent Children at the beginning of the year.I know this game like the back of my hand, I've finished it several times (perfect game and other funny challenges like : No item, No materia, Basic equip.......). Pros :+ Very long game (especially if you do all the side quests).+ So Nostalgic.+ First FF in 3D.+ Excellent story line.+ Several characters to play.+ Several ways of traveling : buggy, chocobos, aircraft, boat...+ Many mini games (Gold Saucer, Chocobo farm....).+ Achievments if you play it on Steam.+ Great musicsCons : - The graphisms can look old for the youngest.- Sometime a bit difficult to understand (especially the chocobo part).- Repetitive (battles). You'll have to grind sometimes, especially if you are new to FF7.- Addictive !!!Anyway, FF7 is a great game. I give it 9/10. If you are looking for a long game, with a thrilling story, FF7 will not be a bad choice, you can't be wrong with this game.Last thing, if you need some advices, tips or anything regarding all FFs prior FF12 (except FF online), add me and ask me even if I'm offline, I'll message you back ASAP.Cheers !- Rora -			"

												This game rocks, sort of.   This is a great game that I would normally recommend to anybody, but this is a very poorly optimized port. First and foremost, the graphics. The graphical limitations from 1997 would typically be a hindrance, that I understand, but this version of the game looks worse than the original version for the PSX. Secondly, the fact that you have to create a Square Enix account just to play an eighteen year old game is ridiculous. I have also had several experiences with my save data disappearing. Frankly, this game is usually amazing, but I would recommend picking up the original Playstation version or the re-release off of the PSN for the PS4.             Not to mention, at the beginning of the game, the first song in the NO. 1 reactor is a                                 few seconds off beat from the original.			"

												A classic game, but the PC port/update is...less than exemplary. There's the cloud saving system, for instance, but it uses your Square Enix account, not Steam's built-in Steam Cloud, and has gone down for significant periods a few times already. There's also the character booster, which is kind of a neat extra, though it depends on the cloud saving system. There are also achievements. Aside from these small value adds though, nothing seems to have been changed since the original PC port, including the inferior MIDI soundtrack from the PC version. The game can be modded to fix that and other things, but there's a catch; doing so will prevent you from using cloud saves (the system rejects any save made in a format it doesn't expect), character booster (which depends on the cloud saves), or achievements. So if you intend to mod the game to make it look better or to bring back the original soundtrack or whatever, you lose everything that Square Enix added and may as well look up the original PC port.The game is good (of course, it's FFVII), but it sucks that Square Enix made such little effort on this new version and made it impossible to update yourself without losing the only things they did add. Another problem is that it doesn't allow you to map the D-pad on your controller to movement keys. It supports the analog stick, but it's almost unusable. I had to download Xpadder and map the D-pad to arrow keys for the controller to be a functional control scheme.tl;dr: good game, bad port			"

Posted: July 19, 2016
												I am going to get so ridiculed for this because of the huge cult following for this game, but I must be absolutely honest here as I am not bound by the nostalgia of rose-coloredglasses. Yes, I only played 4.9 hours on steam. I played more of the PSN version on PS3/PS4 because my computer was in a ""mood"". My PC however will have no major bearing on this review other than to say that I did try this game heavily modded on Steam before my computer decided to hate life.So here is my honest assessment. I would give the game a 6/10 and I only rate it that high because I liked the combat and music. If the combat and music werent so good, I would have given it alot less. I also got the game through a steam sale, (paid $3) though it is normally priced decently for what you get, either way. So that's another reason I rated it a little better than I would have.Here's a breakdown of how I felt about the game. DATED - This is a slightly more beefed up version of the original PS1 game and as such, its dated for this generation of computers and consoles. This isnt a deal breaker, just an observation. You can however heavily mod the beejeebus out of the game on PC, though to me it was more effort than it was worth and my computer decided shortly after starting that it wasnt having any of it. At that point I switched to PS4 to continue playing.STORY - The story would be great if it were fleshed out more to make more sense. As this was my first real play through, I actually had to look up summaries, synopsis and other videos to get the whole picture after I played. IGN's 7 min recap video of the FF7 world was very useful after I'd played through the game and included some information that was added in from Crisis Core, etc.The dialogue and story itself in FF7 felt incredibly rushed and left me slightly confused at times as to what was going on... Though I will admit a good chunk of the confusion here likely stemmed from poor or mistranslations, as I am assuming Square didnt change/fix the dialogue from the PS1 version.I am a huge fan of story-driven games, but this just felt muddled to me. COMBAT - Okay this is where the game shined for me. The turn-based ATB style combat is exactly what I love about old Final Fantasy titles and its just as good here as when I played FF6, FF8, and FF9. So I give a big plus to it for the combat. That was fun. VISUALS - Okay, this is where I have to give a huge MINUS to this game. The background graphics made it severely difficult for me to play this for lengthy periods of time. The game (especially unmodded) would literally give me headaches andI'dhave to stop playing. I had this problem back when I tried to play the original on PS1. I ended up giving my original PS1 game to a friend back in the day because I just couldnt deal with the eye strain and headaches from the visuals at the time. I was hoping that had changed, but not as much as I would have liked. I stillhad to take frequent ""recovery"" breaks. This is something to think about if your like me and had eye strain from the original.Also, Trying to find my way around a given section of map was often unclear because the flat 2D graphics made it hard to determine what was actually traversible area or what was just background. I literally got stuck so many times where I had to load up a video walkthrough to figure out where I was supposed to go, and then I'd facepalm because I had missed a path that was right in front of me because it didnt seem like it was traversable because of the way the backgrounds are designed/rendered. SOUNDTRACK - Okay another huge plus! The music in this game is epic. But then of course it is. It's Final Fantasy! :)I loved FF7's music for years, even though I had never managed to get through the game before. You don't really need to play the game to enjoy its music though. I mean, who hasnt heard One Winged Angel and loved it :)----So that's my honest assessment. Headaches and Eyestrain aside, Immersive Story is a HUGE deal for me, and its what I come to expect from Final Fantasy titles but it just didnt do it for me, so I sadly am rating this a no-go.That being said, I am probably the only person who never got to play this as a kid, and so my lack of nostalgia for this game has no factor in my review.Take my words with a grain of salt. If you loved this game as a kid, you'll probably love it now. But if you've never played FF7 at all, ever in your life, I'll give you a simple and fair advice:  Be wary that it may disappoint due to its age and the translation of the story, but If you can pick it up on steam sale like I did, it's worth deciding for yourself if you love it or hate it :)PS. FF7 lovers. Please don't hate me for the negative review. I reserve judgement on the FF7 world as a whole until after I play the new remake. I just cant like this version ^^;			"

												Technical bits:This is the first PC version with some fixes hacked in i.e they didn't rebuild the game cause they've lost the source code or couldn't be bothered to spend the effort doing so.Also updated to require registration with Square Enix. DRM a clear priority; actual function not even a consideration. No native controller support etc.Actual game:My first RPG game ever, I really enjoyed playing through this when it came out on PS1.  If you like old school RPG's with random battles I'd give this ago if you can over look the technical failures and now dated graphics - but the asking price is high for such an old game. Get in cheap on sale if you're on the fence. Overall:Not recommended due to not being updated to support controllers properly, fix bugs, and mainly because of added DRM. Play on PS1 if you still have it instead. "

												1. This is a sixteen year old single player game and it requires secondary always online drm to run, Which records/sells your personal information and personalizes your nightmare based on how you're willing to sign into it. Steam needs to get their crap together and refuse to list games that include this garbage, honestly considering switching to GOG now.2. Horrible port with worthless controller support, had to use xpadder so the game would let me use my controller's d-pad, which believe me is necessary.If you got scammed out of your money already like me, you can make the experience bearable by linking the game to your steam account so you can bypass logging in to play, disabling cloud saving, using xpadder so you can actually utilize use your controller, and then uninstalling this bongwater and shooting squeenix an e-mail telling them you're boycotting their products from now on because of their drm.

												What's there to say about a PC port of a PS1 game that steamtrained the charge into the 5th generation of gaming? It works and feels about as close as you can get without the original non-analog controller in yours hands. Despite it being what i presume is a direct port, the graphics stand the test of time very well, although there is a hefty graphical mod to be found elsewhere. Hopefully a quick summary will suffice:Pros:Ease of controlImmersive universeLengthy (Originally ran on 3 CD's with the PS1 release)Combat system, storyline & characters are unforgettable.Justifiable price (Bought it full price £10 a week into steam release, got pushed down to £5 the week after; No Regrets)Cons:Graphics are still great to look at, but may not cater to some people expecting a full refurb.Not sure if they replaced the horrible MIDI version of the soundtrack with the steam release, but original PS1 tracks can replace.Growing up with this game since 95', I can safely say that if you don't come to love this game, then RPG's aren't your genre :) "

Then today suddenly it no longer will accept my Steam login information.It's apparent that they only put these features in and released this game to get people to sign up on their SquEnix website and get them to look at their other games, because it doesn't look like they put any work into actually making this work on anything other than a basic ""I can get it to run"" level.

If it works well for you, then enjoy it and you're lucky.  I have logged several hundred hours on PS1.  If it doesn't work and you want to really play this, get a PS1/PS2, hell, even buy from PSN and the original or a really good emulator.  I have been playing games for about 20 years +.  Overall the Final Fantasy series is a top 5 for me.  8/10 (no game is perfect).			"

												A lot of people say FF7 is the most overrated FF game/RPG game and guess what? I disagree with that. If you wanted to play a game that best defines the RPG genre, there's so many titles like SMT Nocturne, Persona 3 FES/4, Dark Soul, Deus Ex etc. to choose from but I think FF7 is the best starter if you're looking to try to get into RPG games.From what I've played, this is the only good FF game with an interesting cast of characters, story and setting. There's something special about this game that puts it above the others really. It feels like the rest just haven't quite captured that same magic FF7 did.  It's no wonder that this has been the most popular FF game to begin with and the most demanded for a remake (and we finally got it thankfully). The gameplay itself is turn based combat which requires good strategy and decision making, with battles happening randomly on the field or getting triggered by specific points along the story. Although the characters look like miniature polygon block versions of themselves when not fighting, the character models are more realistic and proportioned correctly in combat. For its time it was a big step forward because FF7 was the first game in the series to have character models with fully rendered polygons, rather than 2D sprites. Therefore battles take place using a 3D representation of the characters, enemies and the area itself. Moreover, there are 9 playable characters: You have Cloud- an blue eyed blonde haired big lad wielding a bigass greatsword. Tifa- a kind and strong willed tiddy fighter who applies her martial arts skills in combat. Barret- a very burly, built and all around cool Mr.T who uses guns ( think). Yuffie, who acts as a nimble ninja and many more. With a diverse set of characters like I've just described, it's easy to see why something like Final Fantasy 7 was such a huge hit amongst many. It's just a shame that not everyone gets as much development you'd like them to have, which is something I hope the remake really fleshes out considering it's going to be episodic. Fingers crossed that the remake surpasses the huge waves FF7 made in its time and that the devs won't reduce Tifa's bust size to please non-players who complain about petty things.

												One of the greatest games of all time! Pay your respects, and play the original. You never know how the FFVII Remake will turn out so don't wait on that potential disappointment. We all know Square Enix's track record hasn't been very good as of late...For FFVII veterans, I highly recommend Sega Chief's New Threat Mod - new content, bosses, side quests, difficulty, etc. Great stuff!http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=14938.0 "

												Final Fantasy 7... we both know why you're here... the remake is coming out soon and you want to buy it...+ Good Story+ Good Character Development+/- Dated Graphics+/- Timed Turn Based- Random Enemy Encounters- Long Cut Scenes- Unable to skip dialogue 7/10Honestly, this game was okay, but it wasn't mind blowing. I'm sure when it released it certainly was the greatest game for its time, but if you're playing a game like this for the first time, you'll notice how dated it is. The story and environment are a little weird, but it does have its charm. It can be pretty annoying if you die, you have to click your way through the dialogue and be forced to watch any cutscenes. But the worst feature has to be the random encounters. It can be frustrating when you just want to walk across a platform, but you're constantly interrupted by a monster.Overall, it's an alright game. You'll probably play it if you enjoy RPGs, and you probably should play it because it's historical.			"

												I would appreciate it if they add it as an option to get a mature uncensored adult version. The censored dialog just throws me off trying to read it, and it gets annoying. Can this be fixed in some sort of update?I can deal with it to some degree but this annoys me almost enough to want to get my money back, that's just how much it bothers me. Maybe others find it comedic, or don't mind it at all, but I don't. I usually only find censors funny if it's used to comedically unnecessarily censor things that are meant to be funny. This is just irritating, I want to recommend this game but until I can have an option for an uncensored version, this just gets a big two thumbs down for me. I remember as a kid playing this on my PSone back in the day it wasn't censored to the degree that it is here on Steam release. I do know some things were censored, but this, not to this degree it's just frustrating.			"

												So; everyone knows how good this game is, then why did I not recomend this title?  you can get about 60 hours out of this game when your burning through it, that being said my SAVE DATA was LOST about 40 hours in [mostly offline] and I was doing a lot of stuff not just burning.  Later; I found that many others have had this same problem so I looked into it and it was for sure my SAVE DATA was GONE, but how?  I then downloaded some save files online to play around with and I noticed the SAVE DATA DISAPEARING on startup.  so i came to the conclusion that when their program suspects you of cheating it DELETES YOUR DATA.  So.. by all means buy this title if you want to backup your save file everytime you save because it could be you that puts 40 hours into it without cheating and still gets punished... your better off finding the ROM in my opinion though.

												Before you buy this version, consider buying it on PSN. Or finding it some other way. I've played through this game multiple times already through it's lifespan and figured I'd go down memory lane a bit through the convenience of my computer. It works fine for the most part. It doesn't support D-pads for some reason and the thumbstick is far too sensitive, but whatever. There are slightly tedious ways to overcome this, I've heard. The most annoying aspect of it is that EVERY NPC has a permanent O-face. Something happened somewhere in the process and all the NPCs you run into either look like they're in perptual shock or some kind of zombie. They can also look rather glitchy when they blink.If you can comfortably play this game ANYWHERE else, do that instead. Otherwise... I mean... Essentially it's still FF7. Just Derpier.			"

There are absolutely no changes to the gameplay nor sound and graphics in case you are wondering. They simply added achievements and allow you to edit the game stats via Square Enix web site.

												If you've never played the game before and have heard about this game from other people, then this review will help you.I've never played FF7 before, so I decided to buy the steam version to see all the hype!And honestly, this game does not live up to all the hype people say it does. It's not a bad game, IT'S NOT BAD, it's good, but after hearing all the amazing things about this game, I was disappointed.What the game does well:The gameplay is tight, you control 3 characters in your turned based style, each weapon has slots for items called materia. Materia give you access to spells and abillities, so you're gonna be hunting down a lot of these! The world itself is vast and there's A LOT to do. Once you get an airship the game becomes less linear and you're free to go where you wish. Before that, you'll be following the story mainly. The combat can get repetitive though, but it's an RPG so it's not surprising. There's a wide variety of characters to play as, but you have to keep Cloud in the party. The limit breaks look good too. Also, the music in this game is beautiful.What the game doesn't do well:Some of the main cast are mediocre characters, very mediocre. HOWEVER, Vincent, Cid, Aeris, Yuffie and Tifa are awesome. On the other hand, you have Cloud-who is shallow, boring and just nothing like he's hyped up by fans of this game to be. He never takes charge of anything, his dialogue is usually just a generic response to someone else. His character development is kind of lame too. Cait Sith is hands down one of the worst, most annoying characters I've ever seen in a game. I don't know why Square decided to make Vincent optional, but have Cait Sith be in the main cast. The story itself is a wild goose chase to stop Sephiroth from destroying the world, but he's just a lame villain. Honestly, he has mommy issues, all he does is yammer on about her. His motivations are poorly explained too. The backstories for some of the main cast are lame too, I couldn't care for Cait, Barret or Red at all.The animations for summons in this game take a fairly long time, which is frustrating. The idea of Sephiroth being an all power soldier goes down the drain at the end of the game too. I don't want to spoil too much.I don't recommend this game tbh, it's really underwhelming.  "

												If you've never played the game before and have heard about this game from other people, then this review will help you.I've never played FF7 before, so I decided to buy the steam version to see all the hype!And honestly, this game does not live up to all the hype people say it does. It's not a bad game, IT'S NOT BAD, it's good, but after hearing all the amazing things about this game, I was disappointed.What the game does well:The gameplay is tight, you control 3 characters in your turned based style, each weapon has slots for items called materia. Materia give you access to spells and abillities, so you're gonna be hunting down a lot of these! The world itself is vast and there's A LOT to do. Once you get an airship the game becomes less linear and you're free to go where you wish. Before that, you'll be following the story mainly. The combat can get repetitive though, but it's an RPG so it's not surprising. There's a wide variety of characters to play as, but you have to keep Cloud in the party. The limit breaks look good too. Also, the music in this game is beautiful.What the game doesn't do well:Some of the main cast are mediocre characters, very mediocre. HOWEVER, Vincent, Cid, Aeris, Yuffie and Tifa are awesome.

												There's nothing to be said about this game that hasn't been said. If you're really a fan of the RPG genre it would behoove you to play this game. The Steam version is a fairly well-adapted port with higher-res FMVs and Polys than what you'd get on a PSX/PSN version, but does have some minor differences in the script used. Nothing glaring, but if you've played the original enough you'll notice.Not bad game. ♥♥♥♥ dat DRM, tho			"

												I never played this game when I was a kid, so I don't have all the nostalgia hype going for me. Even so, this game has aged very well. Obviously the graphics are mediocre at best, but this game just does so many things right. The main gripe I have with this game (and this may change. I'm not too far into it yet) is that there's no variety in the scenary. You start off in a steam-punkish, giant, urban city, and as far as I can tell so far, there is basically nothign outside of it. You will stay in this steam-punkish, giant, urban city forever.However, like I said that is my only major gripe. The story so far is compelling, I cant wait to see what happens next, the characters are all interesting with real three-dimensional personalities, and despite the low quality of the graphics, I'm even enjoying the visuals that this game offers.

If you're not familiar with playing Final Fantasy, but you've played Kingdom Hearts for example, you might be familiar with a lot of characters from this game! For example Cid, Yuffie or Aerith, but also characters like Cloud or Sephiroth!I would defintly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing RPGs, this one did a great job 18 years ago on the PSX, and still does a great job to this very day on the PC!Edit: How could I forget to mention the awesome soundtrack this game has!

												If you're going for the nostalagia, the controls don't quite feel right; unless you're using something similar to the playstion one controller-for those in the N.American region. Still not a deterrent.An excellent game with an intruiging story line. Looking for a way to impress some super nerd? Play this game and enjoy it. It's worth your time. P.S.-This is Final Fantasy closest to its peak universe creation. Since this one, the world building has slightly slid downhill. It's got dysfunctional main character immersion. Love interests. Excellent score. One of the best villans of all time. It's before Japanese companies said f-u to their major market, white young males, and snuck asian features into all the characters. I hate to say that, but it's true; and I'm glad Final Fantasy went in that direction, because it means they're making games for whom they want to, and that will lead to better games and better people. Better for you, better for me. I just happen to be in the young white male category that sells real well over here in the N. American circuit. Thank you for this wonderful game. I'm confident people in the company know exactly what I'm talking about. This is them at their best writing, though. They have always been a promising company, where one looks forward to what comes next.  I'm waiting to see what tops this game for me. And btw, they're are many titles that are just behind this one.I feel like since I wrote this far, I'd be doing an injustice to anyone that has hung with this to not make a list of my top FF games. (Some have different numbers in Japan)*Final Fantasy 7 *Final Fantasy 8*Final Fantasy 3*Final Fantasy Tactics*Final Fantasy 12 (Long, beware)*Final Fantasy 9Lightning's journey was left out-too linear, so was Bhakka ball and that such. Fun and nodful, but lack luster. The MMO's are ok, great communities, but feel unrelateable, repetitive, for kids. That's fine and great, but this company has traditionally been moving in that direction and wants to stay there it seems. Good for them, I'm sure it makes them money. But they should raise the stakes. It might even be fun for them.Point is, I grew up, and am interested in different things. Interesting things. Look at what sells well in N.America Final Fantasy. Are we really not buying that much anymore? Sad, but think if you Grand Theft Autoed your Black and White wizards? What if we darkened up Cecil from the Red Wings, think young Daniel Day Lewis, think Game of Thrones. Unless it's like an ettiquette thing, or I'm missing something, like promoting sex and violence to a very dangerous and threatening culture? One that's had an, let's be polite, interesting past, with one another. I've never visited Japan, I'd like too! so I can't say for sure what the answer is. I don't think I'd come right out and ask, or should I? I'd definitely need about a Donald Trump level foreign negotiator interpreter. I'm sure that guy/girl will have their hands full if he wins. If that happens, I'd just say keep making games for kids and hope they turn out better.Point is, there's a market for it. I grew up. This is what sells. I buy things. I'm interested in this company. And that's it.			"

												Final Fantasy VII. Is there anybody who doesn't know it yet? Unless you have been living under a rock for more than 16 years, you have at least heard of this, one of the most famous games of all time, loved by many and hated by others, with almost no one remaining indifferent. But what matters is, is this port worth the time? It's basically the same as the game that was released on Playstation 1 and PC years ago. The only thing that is new to this re-release is achievements, which in my opinion are a stupid thing to put in any game whatsoever; the character booster feature, which basically makes battles easier and allows you to buy lots of items and equipment without worrying about grinding for gils; And the music, which uses the Playstation 1 tracks rather than the old and low-quality PC tracks. PC users may find it worthy for the updated music, but those who played it on Playstation 1 are not missing much here. That said, if you have never played Final Fantasy VII, you should at least consider buying it here. All gamers should play this game at least once and cement an opinion about it from their experiences.Get this if you are a hardcore fan who wants to play Final Fantasy VII on the PCs of today, or a newcomer who wants to experience it for the first time. Make sure you grab it on a sale.			"

												This is a grand daddy jRPG game. It changed the face of story telling in a game. Graphically it is dated, gameplay....Well it is odd how the average gamer or at least the industry has shifted away from turn based gameplay. I loved it and still enjoy it. Leveling was one of the gameplay defining elements in this game by excluding magic from the system and making magic & skills a seperate leveling system. You define what characters skills and spells they have and how to use them. In addition you can change what they have after each battle which allows you to better deal with a diffcult fight that requires specific spells for example.What actually makes this game special is the story. The story in the game changed gaming for years to come with it's mature approach. *****POSSIBLE BUT VERY VAGUE SPOILER******Unlike any game of it's time you have to deal with death. Death of party members, death of friends, and death of personalities. Something we all deal with with, friends changing their ways or a more permit lose. The main character battles with this constantly and faces questions with himself that are addressed in what I can only compare to Shakespear in a unique a intresting sci-fi fantasy world.******END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER******If only for the story I can not recommened this game enough. It is alot more focused and less open ended then previous Final Fantasy games but it's story is better for it.Unfortunetly I never got to enjoy it when it came out as I was a N64 guy and only played it at my friends. But years later I got it for PC and it will forever remain on of my top games of all time.Thumbs way up even with the dated graphics.			"

												If you don't know what Final Fantasy VII is about by now you're better off checking real reviews. So let's just focus on the port and how it holds up to today:The port is pretty great now that they replaced the midi music with the PS1 music. (Though truth be told I wish you could choose because MIDI music has its charm to some) Also since it's PS1 music it sounds a bit muffled and still synthesized. The polygon models look great, nice and sharp. Sound effects are fairly sparse by today's standards but they get the job done.There's not a lot of configuration options, though. You can increase resolution, use a bad blurring filter, stretch or keep aspect ratio, or use original graphic mode (pixelated, unfiltered polygons) and then configure keyboard/joystick controls.Xbox 360 controllers integrate well (better if you use a mod from Steam community guides)There's Cloud Saves and Achievements but both are poorly implemented:Achievements are rather incredibly lazy which is a shame because this game natively tracks A LOT of information so why they didn't put more effort into the Achievements is beyond me. 17 out of 36 are just limit break related and that's just using each character's first and last one, and the odd number is because they don't care about you using Yuffie's first limit. So almost half of the achievements are limit break related. Fun.Cloud saving can be annoying because you can't load or save until Square's servers sync. And when it takes less than a second to click through and save or load, being told to wait can be annoying. So far I've never had to wait more than 10 seconds and that was a rare late time, but it's still something worth mentioning because, well, many question why it matters to have Cloud saves. Which brings us to the special trainer called the Character Booster from Square-Enix and it's why we deal with Square's servers for cloud saves in the first place. Here's what the trainer will do: Max HP/MP and give you I think half of the max Gil (so you can't totally cheat for the gil achievement I guess) That's it. So, yeah... Oh, and to use the trainer you have to sign up at Square-Enix's site, if you haven't already, and login there to alter your saves. And that can be unreliable for loading. So if you're going to cheat, do it right and use a fan made trainer instead.It's just another very lazy effort by them considering how much info is actually saved in a FFVII game save. Oh well. The nice thing is you can take it or leave these features.You also can't load saves in game (have to close the game), which can be incredibly annoying but I don't think you could on the PS1 either. It just would have been nice to add that feature on PCAnother annoying thing is that if you don't turn on or plug in your controller before running the game it won't be recognized. A lot of games work this way but a lot also don't care when you do it. So it's worth mentioning.The only other minor issue is if you alt tab for too long you'll make the game error out and there's no borderless fullscreen window mode natively to combat that. (And Steam's web browser integration is the devil on resource leaks) So definitely don't multi-task with this game if you can avoid it.Gameplay-wise this is still a pretty great game. The materia system is still fun and worthwhile. There's a ton of sidequests and items to gather but instead of doing today's method of just plastering them everywhere VII's quests and items are well integrated and hidden and they often involve fun mini-games or mini quests to gain, quests that often ADD to the story rather than detract. Battles can also be fairly fun and challenging if you don't go too crazy with over leveling too soon.The story doesn't hold up very well, I think, if viewed objectively. It would be considered amatuer by today's standards and poorly developed at that. It still has a certain something something to it but it's rough during a lot of spots. But the saving grace is that most of characters are actually interesting and dynamic. Unlike recent Final Fantasy offerings. And there's no annoying in your face narration always getting in the way. But, still, it could have been done a lot better. I will concede, though, that this is probably the last well written Final Fantasy story so far. It's cohesive and well plotted out for that standard.Ultimately, this game is still a lot of fun and for its time it was incredibly well designed and incredibly ambitious. This game did a lot of ""firsts"" on the PS1 from a technical perspective and Squaresoft at the time pioneered A LOT of techniques that would be later used in other games. There's a reason why this game is cherished and respected and why most of it still holds firm today, and young whipper snappers would do well to study why that is rather than be hip and mindlessly hate on the game.A note about the pixelated backgrounds: If you play at anything above the 640x480 resolution you're going to notice major pixelation of the backgrounds. You'll also notice pixelation if you stretch 640x480 to full screen. This is because Squaresoft was so intelligent, like most companies back then, that they didn't feel compelled to make multiple backups of their source material or even back it up in the first place before reducing everything for the PS1 to handle. So, we get this mess. A damn shame. Spend MILLIONS, unheard at that time, and you don't even flipping cherish your hard earned source material.Ok, rant aside you can either deal with the pixelation (which will be noticed even if played on PS1 or emulators on HDTVs) or you can take into consideration what all game designers did back then: These weren't played on HDTVs. They were played on low resolution TVs with scanlines. So, how can you achieve that on PC now? With this SweetFX enchancement: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=162106660. It'll add proper looking scanlines with RGB dot-like lines. It's really awesome and well worth it. It ""blends"" the pixelated backgrounds as far as your eyes are concerned and it'll look like a great TV from back in the day. If you play at a distance, more than 3 feet, it really works well. And even close it looks better than having huge, unblended pixels and it's how we all played it ""back in the day"". So if you want the true nostalgia effect, short of digging out a 200 pound CRT TV, this is the best way to deal with the low resolution backgrounds if you don't want to mod them (which I think look pretty bad anyway). And be aware that certain mods for VII will break achievements and cloud saving, if you cared about that.			"

Posted: April 19, 2015
												I hated this game for almost two decades. This game, hailed as the best Final Fantasy game by many, didn't feel like a Final Fantasy at all to me. It felt like a betrayal of the spirit of the series. I'd made many attempts at playing it over the years, but each time just couldn't get through it.Gone was the beautiful fantasy setting of past FF games I knew and loved, replaced now by a grungy, ugly technologically-advanced city setting. Gone were the gorgeous Amano character designs, replaced now by generic-looking anime characters. Gone was a quick and prompt introduction to a massive overworld, replaced by a ridiculously long introduction section full of corridor after corridor. Gone was the gorgeous spritework of past games, replaced by a seemingly premature move to horribly-aged 3D models and people with blocks for hands.All of this made me find the endless praise for this game utterly baffling.Now, after playing Final Fantasy VII in its entirety (instead of only the first few hours of the game like in my past attempts), I get it. I see why people love this game now.Despite its flaws, Final Fantasy VII is very much still deserving of the Final Fantasy name. It has just as much charm and soul as its predecessors in the series.The game's first few hours are honestly very misleading, as I eventually found out once I got to the overworld. There are towns in the game that look like they could easily have been in FF1-6, for example. The grungy setting of Midgar is not at all representative of what the rest of the game is like. Anyone who is put off by the beginning Midgar portion should seriously continue playing the game so they don't make the same mistake I did for almost 2 decades. It really does get better and opens up after a while - you just have to stick to it.The story is not only engrossing, it even attempts things that its predecessors hadn't. The story of FF VII has a very powerful pro-environmental theme at its core, and the game is totally unapologetic and blatant about it the entire way through, something I really loved about it. It's an incredible shame that modern-day Square is too incompetent to ever remake this game properly (or at all), because its environmental message is even more relevant today than when the game was released, and this will only become the case more and more in the years to come.Despite my premature perception of them, I eventually found FF VII's cast of characters to be really endearing, memorable, and likeable. Not to mention, diverse. I liked that Square was brave enough to introduce the first black playable character in the series, Barrett. (quick rant: FFXV's boyband party is such a step back for the FF series compared to FFVII, how much more dull can you get than a bunch of dudebros in a car - but I digress). With regard to the main lead character, I used to think Cloud was an unlikeable protagonist. In the first few hours of the game (which for a long time were all I had experienced), he was selfish, cold, and rude to everyone around him, even his friends, and to me this is usually a dealbreaker when it comes to the games I play. I need to be able to relate to the character, otherwise how am I supposed to motivate myself to complete their 40+ hour adventure? If the character is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ why on earth would I want to fight for them to succeed? Well, it turns out (surprise surprise) that Cloud actually gets a fair amount of character development later on in the game, and all of the attributes I disliked about him completely fade away. By the end of the game he's become a more humble, respectable hero figure who actually appreciates his friends and their sacrifices. This was great to see unfold.Another strength of the game is the soundtrack. Like all of the previous FF entries, the soundtrack is full of grade-A Uematsu masterpieces. By the end of Part II I was already looking to add the soundtrack and many fan remixes to my music collection, and I'm even listening to the Piano Collections album as I type this. It's just so good. I already know I'm going to be humming tunes from the game for years to come. Even though I only JUST beat the game for the first time in 2015, I already feel a strong wave of emotion when I happen to hear the overworld theme. The game and its soundtrack are just that memorable.Now with regard to gameplay, when I first played the game many years ago, I hated the Materia system. I couldn't believe every character could equip the same Materia, removing any element of uniqueness from the different characters you could add to your party. It seemed juvenile and basic, removing any need to thoughtfully plan out your character's job or skill development. ""Baby's First RPG"" was my first thought. However, by the end of Part II, I was in love with the Materia system. I now realize just how much interesting customization to your party it allows. I spent an enormous chunk of time just trying out different combinations of linked Materia. I'm honestly surprised this system never returned in a later Square game, because it's really versatile and fun to work with once you get deep into it and have acquired enough Materia in the game.So, now that you see me praising the game, do I take back every negative thing I've said about the game in the past? Not everything. I still disagree with people who call it the best Final Fantasy - it's frankly not even close.I still think it's the ugliest Final Fantasy, by far. Square honestly tried going 3D one game too early. Final Fantasy VII would have aged so much more gracefully if they had stuck with 2D sprites for just one more game, while refining their 3D modeling team and engine in the meantime for the next game. Blocks for hands? I get that it's the first 3D entry, but even the first 3D Zelda game managed to do much better than that.However, visuals alone do not make a game, and Final Fantasy VII is a great example of this. Taken as a whole, the game more than makes up for its glaring flaws through an awesome story, characters, music, and gameplay. This is still Final Fantasy at its core. It may look different to someone who grew up with SNES-era FF, but it's still absolutely worth a playthrough for a fan of the previous games.Now, thanks to this game, I feel like my eyes have been opened. If I was so wrong about this game, then I've probably been wrong about the games that came after it too. I now look forward to playing the next several games I've skipped out on, with a completely new perspective. Instead of being resistant to change, I'm going to give it a proper chance. Change can, in fact, be a good thing, as Final Fantasy VII proves.			"

												WARNING: Do NOT buy this game if you don't have a controller linked to your pc! The reason being the controls on the keyboard are annoying and you will just get fed up and probably write a bad review :PAnyways.... would I recommend this game? ofcourse I would!! its final fantasy 7!! playing this brings back so many great memories of when I had it for the PS1 back in the day. You will not be disappointed I'm 90+ hours into the game and I still have a lot to do like kill emerald and ruby weapon (2 new bosses added in for the pc version). For £9.99 its worth every penny but you could also wait til it goes on sale I'm sure I got it for like £3 in the Christmas sale but anyways I'll stop talking now just BUY it trust me!! "

												Final Fantasy 7 is ~17 years old and still one of the best games out there.  Graphics suck, but it was an early ""3D game"", easy to overlook for anyone who has a relatively decent attention span.  The game from Steam seems to have the soundtrack from the PS1 copy (although missing a few things, like the 'escape' sound) and not that POS one from the old windows box.  It's pretty much a jack of all trades game, pioneering a lot of fields, etc.  I've read about people crying for it to be remade for years; honestly I'm hoping they don't touch it.  I can't see this game scoring less than a M rating if they do nothing other than bringing the graphics up to ""PS3/X360"" era - so they'll definitely be taking liberties with several things..  Enjoy the game for what it is, bad graphics or not; it's still an absolute masterpiece.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is the greatest role playing game achievement of my generation.  Combining elements of previous installments in the franchise, FF7 marries the fantastic materia system with a combat system that to this day is still unrivled (only Final Fantasy VIII and X can even compare), and tells one of the greatest tales in video game history.  But, everyone reading this already knows that.  There's not a person in the world that's living under that deep of a rock that hasn't played or heard of Final Fantasy 7, so let's not go there.  Instead, you should be interested in this Steam version of the game. As someone who has grown up on the original Playstation release, playing through it twice on that console, and once as a digital psn download on a psp, this would be my fourth time going through the journey.  Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this re-release is the 1920x1080p resolution, which is the first time it has ever been supported.  For this release, it looks fantastic, being as close to an ""HD"" re-release we will probably ever get.   The steam acheivements help too, and throw in the excellent controller support and you have a real winner.  Final Fantasy is a joy playing again, and I do hope that if you are one of those few that are living under a rock, please take a look at quite possibly the greatest RPG of all time.			"

												Well, I just beat it, at 83 hours in I beat this game. Now I can say at the very least 10 was on over grinding for the last boss and about 30 was because of me doing something stupid and reloading my last save, so over all my playtime for game completion was 43 hours. Now for the $12 they are asking for I would say give it a shot. If you are like me though, you hated this series for one reason or another, try this game. You may have tried it when you were younger or maybe you tried another one like I did, but trust in me this game is great. There are some problems that must be brought up, like the insane grinding you have to do. My first time going to fight the final boss I was about Level 56 or so and I spent 10 hours grinding and got to level 76. The master materia is a joke, for me at least. Beating the Ruby Weapon is unrewarding. Not all moves that you get from the enemy skill materia can be obtained at any (once you can travel freely) time. Part 1 feels like the longest part 2 felt like it was done way too quickly. If you level your character to 99 the game becomes 4x harder. At the begining the story moves at such a slow draging pace that felt like a road trip alone. Some materia is just do bad you cant use it. And after seeing Some things from other Final Fantasy 7 game's (particularly how someone dies) made the game feel like it did not prefore to duty but the good has out wieghed the bad. I strongly recomend it.			"

The Materia system is unrivaled and leveling them up is always a burst of joy.There is one downfall to this game. Square has yet to go back and do a remodel of the characters and environment like millions of people ask them to do each day.			"

												There are only a few games in history that can be considered as work of art. Only a few of those can be remembered for years and years. THAT's one of those few games... simply one of the best games ever made.It's obviously not a competitive game in graphics, gameplay, .... nowadays, but.... remember that this game was released on 1997. And it's considered (by the lovers of this games) one of the best games ever made. It's maybe the ONLY game that has survived for more than 15 years without being edited, remastered or corrected.Maybe one of the best stories/arguments that made Square Enix create, some years later, new games to complete the story (prequels and sequels).For me... is one of those games to remember for years and, if i have children someday, i'll for sure give them the chance to play this game.My score: 10/10			"

												A classic turn based RPG that has aged incredibly well.  Take this from somebody who first played this game in 2009 and not when it originally released when I say that it has aged very well.  The combat is fun and rewarding thanks to the materia system which basically lets you build characters anyway you want.  The story isn't the freshest story out there but what it does it does well.  The graphics are okay for the time but some younger players might be turned off by everybody having dumbells for arms, but there is a mod to upgrade the graphics so all is well.  Music is phenominal which is expected from a Final Fantasy game.  The only downsides to this game is Square's DRM for a single player game and a ""Win Button"" which makes characters level 99 for lazy ♥♥♥♥s.  I say buy it though especially if you have never played it, it is the perfect opportunity to enjoy a bit of RPG history.			"

												Well it isn't the best version of FF7 out there, the game is still fantastic and right up there with the likes of FF4, FF6 and FF9. It hasn't aged particually well in terms of graphics (That's what mods are for) but the mechanics and gameplay still feel great. If you haven't played Final Fantasy VII yet or just want a good RPG then it's absolutely worth your time and money. Just keep in mind that this game requires you to have a Square-Enix Account so if the servers go down then you can't play it. Not really a dealbreaker but still a minor gripe none the less.			"

												FF7 is the best RPG Square has ever made, period. The story line is brilliant with great twists. the game runs smoothly and there are many little easter eggs to be found. The Materia system is unrivaled and leveling them up is always a burst of joy.There is one downfall to this game. Square has yet to go back and do a remodel of the characters and environment like millions of people ask them to do each day.			"

												WARNING: Do NOT buy this game if you don't have a controller linked to your pc! The reason being the controls on the keyboard are annoying and you will just get fed up and probably write a bad review :PAnyways.... would I recommend this game? ofcourse I would!! its final fantasy 7!! playing this brings back so many great memories of when I had it for the PS1 back in the day. You will not be disappointed I'm 90+ hours into the game and I still have a lot to do like kill emerald and ruby weapon (2 new bosses added in for the pc version). For £9.99 its worth every penny but you could also wait til it goes on sale I'm sure I got it for like £3 in the Christmas sale but anyways I'll stop talking now just BUY it trust me!! "

												Amazingly well transported to PC (finally!) and I've been really quite impressed. The default settings work really pretty well with only two or three things I've encountered so far being really, really awkward - playing Tifa's piano to get her final limit break, doing the marching directions as a soldier to impress Shinra in Junon and fighting off the bikers as you escape the Shinra HQ building on your bike - but to be honest, two of those were fairly difficult on the PS originally anyway.You need to fix the save system by making sure that you're saving to local files through configuration (otherwise you can be very frustrated losing data when you first start, as I was once).You need to register through the Square Enix site, which annoyed me at first, but once set up hasn't bothered me since.Everything else has been exceptional, bugless, glitchless and the same old school gaming experience that I loved as a child, dodgy graphic models and all!

												One of the greatest RPGs of all time. Whether you liked it or not, it was revolutionary for its time.  This is based on the 1998 PC version produced by Eidos, but is inferior in quality due to SE ""losing"" the MIDI files from the original version (This is supposed to have been since fixed).  The music is atrocious and most of the glitches are still in place from the original PC release.  Furthermore the additions of a SE account and other things make it a hassle.  However, since this has been around since 1998 on the PC there is rather large mod community around the game here http://forums.qhimm.com/Check it out, they have mods and very easy to follow instructions on how to play this game with enhanced soundtrack, graphics, and even gameplay.  Stand alone, I would rate this a 2/10 and would say to try and find an actual PC disc version online somewhere (or better yet the actual PS1 version), however with the mods, I'd rate this an 8/10 with point suffering for the still possible glitches you may face with the mods.

												Where do I even start with this game...It's just a classic.No matter how bad the graphics are (and they're really not that bad), the story, characters, and gameplay all but make up for it. Each character has an amazing backstory, as well as deep character development. Even the secret characters Yuffie and Vincent have an extreme amount of depth to them. There are many sidequests, for example: Chocobo Breeding & Racing, Limit Break levelling, Ultimate Weapon hunts, minigames, etc., that will keep you occupied when you don't feel like moving on with the story yet, or you want them to use in the story. This is by far my favourite game of all time. 10/10 buy it at all costs.			"

I wouldnt use the character  booster unless youd just like to play for the storyline and not grind. it also disables the achievement's so if your a hunter dont use the character booster. But I truly do recomend Final Fantasy VIIonly problem that I have is the screen flashes sometimes when you start up the game and I have to restart my pc to stop it I do hope they fix this. Besides that its perfect I have not encounterd anymore problems.     - BloodWolf			"

												For all you nostalgia seekers out there, this is your ticket to them good old glory days. Anyways.FF-VII is by far one of the best experiences you can get from a JRPG. Excellent story with a great underlying narrative, rich characters and a deep world to exlpore. Tons of mini-games can be found throughout and many can be revisited. Though I would say some can be time consuming, such as the Chocobo breeding and racing, they have their own rewards for those who really want to invest themselves to get every last drop wrung out of this title. Though the graphics are very dated, the pc port has been lightly polished and performs great. All in all, FF-VII is more than worth the price.Pros:-Classic jrpg active time battle system-Rich story-Great and memorable characters-Tons of things to explore and find throughout the world-Cutscenes still look superb-Nostalgia highCons:-Graphically, this game has aged horribly, even with the polished character models and higher resolution-For a jrpg, combat is fairly easy through most of the game with no major learning curve-Some areas early in the game still have imbalanced amounts of xp earned, leading to easily being levels ahead of your intended level-Some bugs which existed in original still persist in the pc port, but all are rare and hardly gamebreaking-Needs to support higher resolutionsAs said, you'll get a perfect jrpg experience here and not feel a single penny is wasted if this is your kind of bag.
