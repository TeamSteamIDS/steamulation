Posted: June 18, 2014
												I'm going to come back here and update this review. A lot has changed relatively fast, as it typically is in MMOs, so I feel like my old review is a little inaccurate. My first review of this game was posted slightly after 4th Jobs were added if my memory serves, and the game is just... so different now.First, I still recommend it. It's a very new player friendly MMO, and while that annoys me personally, I get the push to make games like this more rewarding to a new player. It's a great experience overall and the story translation is getting better bit by bit. The localization team is also getting a lot better about pushing updates through at a more timely pace - if you knew how long it took to get Season 2, much less the episodes of Season 2 vs Season 3 and then almost immediately Counterattack and Vagrant, you would think the localization team was replaced by gods.So, what changed so much for me to think I need to come back and update a year and a half old review? Everything. Literally everything. When I wrote this review at first, there were six classes, the most recent being Soul... Lord? Master? Edgy Wizard. It was a pretty strong class with few noticable downsides, a stark contrast to the second most recent class at the time - Engineer, which is a class made of downsides and few noticeable postives.Fast forward to now. We were treated to the introduction of a new class - the Card Master. Unleash your inner YuGiOh and throw playing cards at your enemies to destroy the forces of evil... and sometimes capture the forces of evil and use them to destroy the forces of evil! ... So yeah, less like YuGiOh and more like Pokemon. Maybe if the two met. Sounds like it would make a great anime. This class came along with Season 3, which brought tremendous change to the game's basic systems, simplifying almost every aspect of gameplay, and bringing out quite a few gripes from me personally.First and most notably, the weapons system was overhauled. Instead of having unique weapons that you can find from various enemies, each with specific stats to help encourage a particular playstyle, you get two generic classes of weapon - basic, and (S). Only a fool would ever use the basic weapons as they come with no bonus stats, never drop with an option (enchant) on them, and are significantly less powerful than the (S) weapons. Why weapons that aren't (S) weapons exist is well beyond my comprehension, because it doesn't add the same depth of gameplay that, say, having ten different swords to choose from did. Sure - towards endgame, everyone just uses the same powerful weapons from endgame dungeons, but there was a certain charm in seeing lower level players (and sometimes higher leveled players) choose a weapon because of its slightly unorthodox stats.Weapons weren't the only thing - class specific armor was removed entirely until level 180, forcing every class to equip themselves the same and reap generic stamina/strength benefits. It's worth noting that since luck has a semi-unknown effectiveness cap, there's not much point in stacking in, and since only three of now eight classes use magic primarily, it's sensible to just protect mages until level 180, but having to choose what armor you like the best based on the same principle of diversity that weapons once presented just feels better, like you're actually doing something, you know? An even bigger problem (for me personally, your mileage may vary) is how good the generic (S) armor is. They outshine the instance dungeon armor hands down, and protect even the squishiest classes against otherwise challenging boss monsters and huge mobs of enemies. To get the same challenge from low level instance dungeons that newer players would get in Season 1, they'd have to take their armor off entirely. The incredibly powerful weapons would probably still end the fight too fast for the boss to have a fair chance, though.Simplification isn't always bad though. Potions no longer come in health, sp, and combination, and instead only come in combination, and they heal huge. As a Savior main (tremendous HP), HP potions never did anything for me, but now I can get a full heal off of just one potion. Yeah, it's easier than it once was, but it's a welcome change to have potions that heal enough to satisfy every class' needs. Crafting was simplified as well, but it's a bit more double edged - it's easier to gather materials to make weapons, armor, accessories, and food, but crafting has been made generic - no one needs to find a refiner to get them to make cloak kits to take to an accessory crafter and have them make cloaks - you can do it all yourself now. Again, this is just a personal gripe because I prefer slightly more complex systems, and in the end, it really does make crafting a more enjoyable experience. You also level it up by paying in game currency instead of having to craft 10 billion worthless items.As it stands now, you might as well consider yourself new until you hit level 170, and then the game actually starts. The problem now, though, is how much of a sharp increase there is in difficulty past that point. Dungeons go from extremely easy to unfair just like that, and for new players who aren't used to the steady climb in difficulty of Season 1 (and to a lesser extent, Season 2), it seems really sudden. Even to someone like me who's been playing for four years, the endgame dungeons seem poorly balanced to favor players who enchant their gear to get overpowered stats - and honestly these dungeons are all but impossible to complete without overpowered enchants. It seems like a poor choice on the developer's end to balance these dungeons to challenge the players who purposefully made the rest of the game too easy for themselves, instead of balancing the difficulty towards the middle of the road players who were taught by the game that they'll make it if they stay dilligent.Just to provide an example - the first true endgame dungeon is Velfa Library. The boss does almost exclusive magic damage (which most armors and classes do not defend against), but the generic mobs in the dungeon have reasonable HP and while they hit hard, they don't hit super hard. This dungeon is a reasonable challenge, and is balanced well for the level you're supposed to visit it at.Meanwhile, one of the newer dungeons, Road of Dream, is full of generic mobs that hit like a freight train and have health on par with the boss of Velfa Library, each. If you haven't come geared to hit for 100,000 at minimum and/or take thousands of damage per hit, you won't last here for more than a minute. I wouldn't complain about the unreal difficulty if anything in the game up to that point prepared you for it, but nothing comes close. Like I said, you go from ""wow that was a great dungeon and a real challenge"" in Forgotten Garden, to dead in two hits at Ymir, and you're hard pressed to even level up enough to face these challenges. Ymir becomes available to players at level 190, but at 197 I can't make it past the first room.Oh, and before I forget, let's talk about Wanderer, the eighth class. Soul Man was Edge Magician, so now meet Edge Warrior. A class all about slinging a huge katana everywhere, but wait! The katana is actually a lamp. Like Card Master, this class forgoes the idea of an SP bar, and instead uses something a little different but exactly the same. Also this class is STRONG, like level 50 hitting as hard as a 197 Savior strong. It honestly annoys me to think about how rediculously strong the class is, and although I haven't played it, stats-wise I can't find a downside. I've been in parties with them though, and their average damage output of a few hundred thousand is exactly what the endgame calls for. Now if only they'd balance the rest of the classes like that.Again, I still love this game and recommend it for its gameplay, but when you reach true endgame, it might be your breaking point.			"

												Let me preface the review by stating that I tend to be extremely thorough when I give feedback to a game. This will be a very long post, but I intend to provide clear, current information about the game so that readers might make an informed decision before committing to a download. Though I may not have put thousands of hours into Latale, I'm an old MMO hand and extremely picky when it comes to games  - the eighty hours of gameplay I've put in were enough to get a character to level 160, create a guild, and otherwise see everything the game has to offer. As such, I have some valid input - I encourage you to read everything I have to say.Please note that the date of this review is Septemeber, 2015. The information provided should only be considered accurate up to this date. Drastic changes have been made to LaTale and more will undoubtedly come. Keep this fact in mind if you find this review at a later date. Tha being said, lets dive on in. CONS:GAME-BREAKING PROBLEMS:-Confusing quests/translations-Content is a year behind the Korean version-Content has been constantly and drastically changed-Content is broken or unfinished in some places -Community is lacking members, support, guides, and information-Gameplay is entirely quest-based and far too easy-Enchanting destroys your items gratuitously, despite the initial ""95%"" success rate (there are hidden factors that cause items to explode way more than they should - trust me, I did the math)-Crafting is limited, requires a huge initial investment to be able to use, and has depressingly low success ratesMINOR COMPLAINTS:-The sub-class is useless-Sprinting mechanic is clunky-Players don't control passive stat point allocation upon leveling-There are many vestigial items left in the game (items that once were used for crafting, alchemy, or upgrades and currently have no apparent function)-FALSE DIFFICULTY (only time you die is when creatures render you immobile by ""chain attacking"" as a mob so you can't move, jump, attack... other features like this make it seem unfair to the player and is just frustrating)-Questing becomes unimaginative and repetitive-Certain consumables have extra-long cooldowns when they really shouldn't have one to begin with -Certain classes are clearly better than others (cardmaster) and yet others are clearly pointless to play (poor knights...)PROS:-Casual-100% free to play-There is no pressure or need to spend money on fashion items (which can be bought through NPCs or players with in-game currency)-Devs are generous and frequently give free cash shop items -Small, friendly community-Game economy is stable-Plenty of things to keep you busy after reaching lvl200-Beautiful art, music, and animations-PVP & PVE-Endless quests-Plenty of ways to add passive stats to your character (guilds, dating, item codex, monster images, titles, etc...)-Decent character customization-There is no real way to ""ruin"" a character build-NO HACKERS, SCAMMERS, OR BOTS-Despite being behind on content, devs seem to still have presence and update semi-regularly-In game achievements -Addictive combo-based fighting-GOOD  PVE equips often FOUND through drops-NostalgicNow, let me explain some points a bit in further detail and then wrap it up. It may seem like there is a lot of bad here, but consider that a  lot of the content issues I have brought up only occur in specific situations. For instance, when I said that some of the content is broken or missing, I am not referring to abundant, general glitchiness. There were a couple situations where broken content clearly inhibited the gameplay. For example, at the water dragon boss - the portal to move to the third instance of the boss fight is broken. I could not continue the fight, so I was not able to finish the quest. This left a bad taste in my mouth because I had to waste a warp capsule and I left the dungeon feeling deprived of potentially awesome content. Things like this frustrate players (especially veteran players who might have nostalgia about that boss).Furthermore, there were several quests that frustrated me because they were confusing. So they ended up cluttering my quest log. Translation was extremely on-point for this game in terms of grammar. Yet, I found myself wanting more clear and detailed explanations for certain dialogues (which may be attributed to the inherent translational errors resulting from language differences). For instance - the sub-class quest! If I hadn't done preliminary research on the topic, I would have ended up freaking out because it seems like your character gets demoted to level 140 and loses all its stats, skills, and equipment. I spent hours looking for resources that just werent there (I had to search forums and piece together little tidbits of info just to figure out what exactly the subclass was). If the quest dialogue had been just a tad more explanative and detailed, I would have known that a specific NPC (available in the Guild Hall *take the town portal*) allows you to change between your main class (which isn't lost) and  your sub class every -thirty minutes- (which is why the sub-class is utterly useless IMO) Yet another quest has you purchase a special warp capsule to enter a mario-themed 8-bit retro world and complete a series of jump quests. The quest dialogue says absolutely NOTHING about that fact. The WORST error I discovered was a quest that told me to hunt ""Humbaba 18+"" monsters, which don't exsist. However, there exists a ""Humbaba 14+."" Naturally, I assumed these must be the monsters I needed... Nope. Turns out it was a completely different monster, with a completely different name, that I needed to complete that specific quest. That's the sort of error that makes gamers pull hairs and grind teeth. It was a clear content error, which when considered with all the other minor errors and frustration points, made me feel like I was playing an unfinished product. The fact that the game is free means that I have no real right to complain about recieving a sloppy product. However, there are clear indications that this game was once an MMO giant with tons of features and content. There are vestigial items that indicate crafting was once intricate and involved. You have a mining action, and there are mining spots... but, mining yields no items and has no purpose in the game. There is the option to upgrade your items and add runes, but they don't work or require mining items you will never get. So it's obvious they already had a complete and AWESOME game. What is left is a fragmented ghost of a once amazing and addictive product. Why ruin a good thing? I gave it some thought and I decided that they ultimately changed the game for the better. If the game is involved and hard, it makes it really convenient for people to take advantage by botting, scamming, and hacking... So the community suffers. Additionally, if the game is so hard and involved that players never reach the level cap - there are so many people who will never get to experience the full game. There will be tons of worlds, quests and monsters they will never see because they refuse to hack the hundred-billion ely needed to create the overenchanted equips necessary to fight high level monsters. OGplanet took a stand against that culture and made the gameplay to where you can just kick back with a friend and have FUN. I feel like the changes targeted stressful time wasters like mining because they inhibit progress and encourage a negative community. Now, you don't even need enchants to PVE well... Just good skills. All in all, it's what I was looking for - a relaxing and colorful FREE MMO with friendly people to kill wild boars with :3 It would be better if it was complete and polished, but I can look past it. Hopefully this review provided enough info for you to decide whether you can look past its faults or not for yourself.			"

												I played this game for a long time. I peek'd. I had more fun and hapiness than i can think of having in the future. I met a lot of interesting people. Made a lot of friends. Family even. I got to a decent level and did all i could to make others feel the same way i did. Slowly they all departed. As did I. I still miss every single one of them. I can recall one of them was going overseas with the army. I hope you are ok dude.Now to the real review: I had the most fun ever. This game is not only about battling and leveling... its about the people! Thats the most important! I recomend, yes i do.To all the people ive met on La Tale, that made Dan who he is today, I wish you hapiness. Nothing more, nothing less.Good day.			"

												LaTale: 2D platformer MMORPG8/10Having played this game on and off since 2009, I believe I can write a fair review for it.  LaTale is not perfect, but what free to play game is?  I will say that it is a very fun 2D platformer MMORPG.  The music is great, the artwork is beautiful, the skills are flashy, the classes are not one-dimensional and most of them actually require a decent bit of variety to play them to their full potential.  I have tried Maple Story, but the gameplay was just too simplistic and boring to hook me.  LaTale has hooked me due to its more in-depth gameplay.Now, a lot of people may have reservations of picking up a free-to-play game, thinking it's pay to win.  This is not the case with LaTale.  Will you need to spend a few bucks to get started, like with an auto looting pet?  Yes.  But here's the nice thing about LaTale: most of the cash shop items are tradeable, so you can get those items by playing the game and trading with other players.If you're looking for a fun, pretty, cute, silly and exciting 2D rpg experience, then LaTale is the game for you!

												I've played over 100 hours on Steam, likely upwards of 1,000 overall. This game has kept me playing since 2008, so it's obviously pretty good.1- there is no be-all and end-all gear- I've managed to beat a max level Elemental Master and max level Soul Lord both with max-level Valkyrie (some of the strongest weapons in the game) in 2v1 PvP (my partner lost connection) as a level 13 mage.2- it isn't pay to win. The fashion shop items are really just niceties, and being active will get one of the many login for x duration/for x many days to get x item events to take effect. And you can buy almost all Astro (OGPlanet's cross-game currency) from players, and find a large amount of them as wellEdit: The game now has OP gear for the first 170 levels, and then you get a bit of choice with your gear again. The level cap is also 220, with a new class coming out soon.			"

Posted: September 16, 2014
												I've tried every class available in this game up to at least Lv.20, and have played three up to the first job change (Guardian, Treasure Hunter, and Meister).  I have to disagree with all the glowing reviews of this game. My experience has just been a mindless repetitive grind with little customization outside of appearance.Suppose I'll start with what I mean by ""little customization."" You earn a single skill point each time you level up. You use these to learn new weapon attacks and passive skills. Every weapon tree, however, only has 4 or 5 attacks that have to be learned in a certain order. There's no branching, no ""this or that."" Just straight up, ""these are your five attacks that you'll use over and over for the rest of your days."" All skills, including passive ones, are level-locked also, further limiting your choices of where to spend your points. Further still, some classes only have one weapon type available to them (Soul Breakers, and Engineers of the starting classes).After undergoing my first class change from Knight to Guardian, Engineer to Meister, and Explorer to Treasure Hunter, I noticed that of the three, Guardian and Treasure Hunter play very much the same as their first-tier counterparts. You start off with slightly flashier versions of the same five skills you had previously (in the case of Knight to Guardian, you lose the ability to use any other weapons besides knuckles), and not much else noticably changes. Meister was the only class of the three that played differently in that now instead of swinging around a fashionably metrosexual pumpkin man-purse, I now had a nifty yellow mech as my weapon. Unfortunately with the mech, every attack, even basic attacks, drain your SP. Having low SP to begin with, I was only able to fight one or two enemies before having to rest. Not sure if I was just doing something wrong, but needless to say, I didn't exactly see a whole lot of meisters rolling around.Leveling in LaTale consists of talking to one quest giver, receiving multiple quests to kill certain enemies, completing thosequests, then receiving more quests to kill those same enemies five more times until you move to the next area and repeat the process. It's incredibly tedious and gets very stale quickly.There seems to be some sort of crafting system, but I could never figure out how to participate. It's not included in any of the tutorial quests. Further, equipment and potions drop so frequently, I question just how useful crafting would even be in this game.I have some minor issues with the interface also, such as the inability to increase the font size, and how your tracked quests disappear from your HUD whenever you log out or the game crashes. Again, rather minor.One last thing...prirings are totally and unabashedly a ripoff of porings from RO.			"

												I picked this game back up a couple of months ago to see some of the changes in the game.  Not a lot of changes and not different from how I used to remember it.  In fact, I enjoyed it all the same.  There is a cash shop market for the game, and it works well.  The game itself doesn't seem to restrict you a whole lot, but it can be a grind at times.  The simple music gives it a happy appealing feel and is very similar to Maplestory.  I think it's a good game, and I couldn't find a whole lot that I didn't like.			"

												After playing for 4 months and getting two chars to level 195+, it is time for my review of the game.For everyone who was disapointed by Maplestroy Europe, Latale is the way to go. In comparsion to Maplestory, the grapics are better, i load the game faster, the gameplay is much less  ""mash one button"", the classes are much better balanced, i level MUCH more quickly (if you know what your doing, you can get to level 195 in three weeks), and most importantly:A LOT LESS PAY-TO-WIN THEN MAPLESTORY. Endgame is VERY achivable with low budget. Really, you only really need a Warpcrystal (which needs recharge, which however can be bought ingame) for teleporting around (i got mine from an event even !) and maybe a syringe for healing potless - everything else can be got for ingame currency! The controls can be annoying in the beginning (double tap to run) but nothing that will be a problem after a week of play.I should note that i had an massive game breaking bug with the steam version (Game crashes by pressing any keyboard button, though gamepad works(though not advisable)), BUT playing Latale through the OGP Launcher did not cause any problems.

												I started playing this game when I was fourteen and fell in love with it. It's much better than Maple Story in my opinion and a much more friendly playerbase to boot. Fluid skills and animation, fun hack-and-slash fighting, cutesy avatars.The only troublesome cons are the lag, and servers crashing every once in a great while. Also don't forget the bugs that come and go every time the GMs are working on the game. But other than that, it's a great 2D side-scrolling MMO to play. As a long time player myself, I highly recommend it. :3			"

												I have about 5 hours logged onto the game, so this may be pre-emptive, but I'd like to say something about it so far.Likes:- Great artwork!The game itself is beautiful and it feels unique. The world itself is unique and so are the characters. It seems like there is a lot to see in this game.- Music is very enjoyable.Every area has its own music, which tells me that they put A LOT of time and effort into this game. Being a musician myself, I know how much effort goes into 1 piece of music.  All of the music i've encountered so far has a very warm sound to it and sounds very happy. That ties in with the friendly atmosphere of the game.- Friendly environmentLike it advocates, this game has a very friendly atmosphere attached to it, which is extremely desirable for MMOs these days. One of the biggest problems in MMOs is the community in most games. While I wouldn't say that this is an extremely populated game, it does attract friendly people. I've not seen any slander or inappropriate text in all chat and everyone seems to be willing to help out.Dislikes:- Strange Controls:It's nothing you can't get used to, but double-tapping to run gets pretty tedious. The original hotkeys are also sort of strange in comparison to other MMOs. You can set them yourself, but initially, will be a little confusing.- Quest UI:The quest UI is a little strange in that, it has the story description of the quest on the first tab and then another tab for the specific quest description/reward. It's not a terrible feature, but it's not quite convenient either. You always have to click over to see the specifics. A quest bar on the side will pop up also to help you track your quests, but clicking on them doesn't bring up the quest in the quest log, so that's also not very convenient.- Quests are a bit boring:I normally love the grind on MMOs, but it just doesn't seem too fun in this game. You collect a quest to kill certain mobs and then after turning it in, you are asked to kill them again to collect items from them, and sometimes even asked to go back a 3rd time to kill the same mob to get a different quest item. It seems a bit too tedious.- Not much difficulty:It's pretty easy. I guess the first 20 levels of any MMO can be described the same way, but I mean, I didn't really have to try too hard to be good at my class.- Limited Battle Customization:Maybe I was spoiled with WoW, but it seems like the battle customization is pretty low. I've gotten a few new skills and chose where to put my skill points in my own order, but they are still capped by levels. I suppose that's fair, but in terms of having unique skills, you kind of just put the points in your own order, but you're still dictated by the level system. I'm sure this won't be a problem in later levels, but for now, it does make leveling not very fun.All in all, a pretty good game, but I couldn't see myself investing a lot of my time into this game. I'm glad to have gotten the experience so far and will probably grind a bit more just to see if my opinion changes. I wouldn't recommend the game as a long term game, but I would recommend it if you're looking for a friendly place to game,			"

												0 playtime because I've played this game a lot off steam. Like, more than I'd like to admit. Probably 1000+ hours worth, or somewhere around that number. I was there when the closed beta for both OGP and Aeria games held this little treasure, and I was there when there were just 4 initial classes, and you had to get to 80 to rank up. Back when puzzle pieces were locked behind a paywall.Needless to say, I've played this game a lot. Not so much anymore, what with real-world responsibility weighing down on me, but I can tell you for a fact that this MMO is definitely worth your time.The animations are fluid, and the way combat works is very different from Maple Story, and I believe it looks a thousand times nicer too. Whereas in Maple you'll usually stick to a spot, throw a couple skills out at enemies, jump around to avoid an enemy or something then repeat, Latale has you constantly spamming your rather nice looking skills, stick-then move basis where enemies go down relatively quickly to  your power in a gratifying and enjoyable way. And the game rewards you for your quick movements and your quick attack chains with a hit counter (Which, by the way, increases your exp and ely awards the higher it is).Since it's many updates and balances, Latale has a total of 6 initial classes (since I last checked), the 4 main ones (Warrior, Knight, Wizard, Explorer) splits off into two paths each, while the other two (Engineer, Soul breaker) just change into their own new thing. These changes happen at level 40 (Used to be 80, that being a long and arduous journey to get there), and once you do get to that golden number, just about everything changes. Whatever class you chose to go into at that level gets massive buffs, new skills, sometimes even new playstyles (Like Engineer --> Meister, go from wielding a suitcase into a pilotable mecha. No, nothing in that sentence is a typo.), which radically either changes the game, or sets you on a new course with new skills and powers to try out on the masses of enemies just awaiting to die. And the class upgrades beyond that do just the same.Lately, the game seems to have gotten a pay-to-win vibe to it, which is very discouraging to new players. But most of the items you can buy in the item shop, you can attain in-game through either some work or some of the many events that OGP seems to like to throw it's players. Stuff like the fashion items and the auto-loot pets, along with some other key items that makes life super easy is locked behind that paywall. It's fairly annoying, but the game's entertainment value for what it does and it's wild ride more than makes up for it. Plus, if you do so choose to spend money, you get some relatively good value for what you spend (Take advantage of the sales!).Unfortunately, like almost all MMOs do, it starts to get grindy once you start getting to 70+. Fairly late in the game, and at the point where you've already accomplished so much, and there's much more to go, that you'll either want to keep going, or you'll start to fall out and just play once in a while. I'll leave this particular part up to you to decide if you'd want to keep going from there. But even if you do play up until then, it'll be the best ~70 levels you've ever played in an MMO, I guarantee it.Not gonna lie, there is some pretty bad localization in this. They've had over a few years to get it right, and they still haven't, even some of the NPCs that have been in the game since day 1 of closed beta. If you're a grammar nazi, or if seeing silly sentences turns you off, be warned. There's some story to the game, and unless you have an open mind or you're totally cool with skipping all the dialogue and text boxes on the quests, you'll get annoyed quickly. There's some untranslated items sprinkled around too, though not nearly as common.To sum it all up, Latale is a fantastic ride, with it's combat feeling fresh and exciting with each new skill and class one tries out, and continues to do so until the later levels. While the game is slightly pay-to-win, it's largely negligible unless you want to take a bunch of shortcuts or have that autolooting pet. The localization is at best passable, and at worst downright terrible, but if you can look beyond that, latale is a fantastic MMO to sink your teeth into.And no, it's not a Maple Story clone. IMO, I think Maple could take some lessons from Latale.			"

												Pros: -Cute artstyle-Simple controls-Easy to learn game mechanics-Lively community-Small downloadCons:-Gameplay can be a bit repetitive-Quests can often blend together (i.e. fetch quests, and grinding)-Gold can be difficult to come by depending on your level of MMO savvy.Should I roll with it?:-If you're a fan of MMO's and you can't afford WOW or have a computer that can run TERA, it's a neat game to try out.-If not, then go play TF2 or whatever half the steam community does these days.

												I played this game quite a bit years ago, the game play is very fun and the community was very kind. In fact they boasted the best MMO community at one time, and I'd guess they were right. On the outside the game may feel like a Maple Story clone, but if you give it a chance you might see that you enjoy it much more than that. Fluid skills and animations make for fun gameplay, so give it a try.			"

												I've played LaTale for a long time and I always end up playing it for long periods of time when I come back around to it.  For newer players the game can be more challenging without the money to add extra stats, but that's part of the fun. The playerbase consists of lots of humorous, nice people and the GAs/GMs are interesting when they are around.  If you like grinding, you can join in and have fun. If you like questing, you can do the same.  LaTale has a bit of everything for everyone to help satisfy the 2D platforming genre, whether it be focused in social or pure battling.  With a level 200 level cap and tons of content to come, as they arrise, I would recommend LaTale for anyone to try.If you need help, I don't mind if you ask me: ♫IGN:  Chronophobia, Lagombi, Eventreur			"

												This is an absolutely FANTASTIC game! You will be reeled in so quickly you won't even realize it yourself. The new update (Which makes questing more viable and reliable) makes the game extremely fun and not a grind as much as before. Now going through the storyline is MUCH more beneficial. [This is for people who don't know what the game is]: La Tale is a friendly MMORPG that has a kind-hearted community and an enforced one, meaning not so nice people will be dealt with. The game isn't pay to win. You can still do 95% of what La Tale has to offer without paying. Cooler-looking customization and sort of getting things done faster is the other 5%. With over 40 unique classes, being categorized as ""Starter"", ""Advanced"", ""Experienced"", and ""Optional, or Sub Class Esperience"".  The trailers of this game will show you how the game plays. That's all I have to tell you.			"

												As an '08 player, I still enjoy the game as much as I did before. Gameplay and movement is some-what clumsy, but over time you can get used to it. Music is just beautiful. (': Each town has a unique song that is(In my opinion) soothing. As a 2D Side-scroller MMO, it is similar to Maplestory, Wonderking, and various others, it's the same as others: Quest, Grinding/Farming, Boss battles. Scenario quest are interesting if you want to know the story. Grinding/Farming for Levels and In-game currency(ely) and Intense and enjoyable boss battles. Economy is somewhat small at the moment, but is mostly friendly! In the Party Search, if you ask for help, you'll recieve it! 10/10 (:			"

												La Tale is a wonderful, fresh breath of air in the 2D MMO community. It has amazing graphis and animations, a wonderful story, quests gives great rewards for minimal effort, servers are rarely down, GMs are enthusiastic, friendly and involved with the community, and all these are relatively easy to learn. There are many dungeons ingame, that will always keep you on your toes. You never know quite what to expect in the world of La Tale. All in all i would suggest if you like MMOs at all, that you should definitely give this one a try!			"

												So happy I have spent so long on this game.I played it since Open Beta and glad it has changed so much for the better!Plenty of events for new players and current players to win some high in-game items worth millions or even cash items with easy log-in events or some other easy event.The GM's are lovely and really like to interact and act like real players when in the game.Easy to find players to party with for certain quests due to a party-index function however some quests are not tranlated aso you may get stuck without a guide. A few quests trick you into getting an item in the description while the goal of the quest is different but a careful eye can spot this out easily.It is easy to pick up and play however I suggest researching the classes, watching game-plays to see which class line-age you want to start as because you cannot change it and sadly all names you delete cannot be re-used!You can transfer ely and cash items through the bank/fashion shop to your other characters on the account however my only problem here is that pets cannot be transferred to other characters. Most likely to stop hackers stealing them but this can get annoying when you have to feed multiple ones every month which can add up to some costly ely in-game if your not a rich player.Highly reccommend getting this otherwise for the little nit-picks. It is so cute with its style and for those who love to customise while being an epic hitter will surely love it.			"

												No. Just no. This game does have cute artwork and frilly effects, but the whole experience after you exit the ""OMGASH Maple Story Reloaded"" state can be defined by one word: grind. Endless, mindless grind, with little scenery change. You might find it enjoyable for a couple of days, as i did, maybe weeks, but in the end, the grind is going to take its toll on you. Being a 2D mmo with platformer elements, the grinding experience is not as thrilling as in your regular mmo.The game itself is not yet truly dead, but not very alive either, not in the way a mmo is supposed to be. The global chat restriction is only making this worse, since the player feels alone and accompanied only by the money selling bots cluttering the chat. All in all, it can be a nice experience for a short while, but i wouldn`t recommend investing in it too much time, nor expecting too much.The positive reviews i saw so far are partially true, i can`t deny that, but they all apply to an informed, semi-experienced player, that already has a few characters max level (i stopped to only one lvl 200 char) and only adress the specific good points of the game, without referring to the bad ones or seeing the game as a whole, from the new player`s point of view. Oh, fair warning, there is 0 support for Steam customers. Literally 0. You can`t log in on their website with the account you made through Steam, you have to make a new one, and on the Steam forums the GMs answer every once in a blue moon, and that if you are lucky ;). Which means if you plan on making any purchase in-game, think again. And then again. Till you change your mind and not feel the urge to make the said purchase anymore. This was the end of the line for me and the main reason i can`t and won`t in good faith recommend this game to any Steam user. Nice promising game for a certain niche, poorly developed and supported sadly.			"

												I used to play this with my crush around 4-5 years ago when this still open in my country.. Was a sweet memory. I still remember that day. When I started at Belos with her. Having talked about what our future guild will be. Having talked about crafting professions. When we created the guild. I let her be the guild leader. We planned to recruit new players to make them stick with us. We've created nice equipments for our guild recruits. It was very fun. After a while. The server shutted down. It was very sad indeed. Only few of the members continue to play in ogplanet's server. My crush is not included due to her personal reasons. I wish I can go back to those days...Although I left this game for a while. I came back. I created new character. It's too easy now. I reached lvl 40 in just around 3 hours. New players won't know the struggle how hard it is to reach lvl 100. Or even 200.			"

												My honest opinion, I like the style the game has, it has beautiful scenery, pretty simple skill system, cute characters n monsters.Bad things came to mind playing, walking and jumping seems bit sluggish, I feel like i'm dragging 10kg slob of cement with me and many times my skills miss enemies :(Also about the cash shop, when I opened it it seemed to be cheaper than maple story, until i checked how much astro is in euros... It's really expensive.As things are at the moment, I can't recommend this game to anyone and that makes me sad, it could be up there competing with maplestory, but it has some serious flaws and it needs to update the games graphical looks (HD & 1920x1080 at least), on the last note at least the cash shop loads faster than maplestorys one does.

												La Tale is a fun 2d side-scrolling mmorpg.  It has a cute artstyle, but the underlying game mechanics are a lot more complex than the appearance would lead you to believe.  There's tons of stuff to do in the game, from questing, to gathering up items and cards to build a codex of items/monsters, to instance dungeons that need eight players to do properly.The recent season three update has vastly improved the game with lots of quality-of-life improvements, as well as making it significantly easier to get to high levels and reach end game.  The quest rewards have been significantly enlarged, making leveling, especially in lower levels quite simple.  Just do your quests and the levels will follow up till about level 100 when it starts to slow down.  (This slow down is temporary, as once you get another ten levels or so the amount of quests pick back up till around level 170/180.)Give it a try, it's free and a lot of fun.  I've been playing it since the closed beta in 2008, and made a new account on Steam just to have it on my account.  (I'll admit to wanting the badge too.)			"

												I may not have many hours played on Steam for this game but I have bucket loads from OG Plantets side. La Tale has so many different ways to play and the classes are just so unique and epic. The art is a cute anime theme but the combat is intersting since it is a 2-D game. The crafting can seem overwhelming sometimes because their are items galore. The starting classes are not halfbad either because they are all good at something. Unlike some 2-D games the shields in La Tale can be used to block and that shocked me. The best part I have to say is the abundance of costumes. There are so many costumes it is almost like a dress-up game.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever seen. While mixing anime with an MMORPG, La Tale was born. This game is one of the best anime MMORPGs on Steam.The game's community is ranged widley from children to young adults. There is much oppertunity to customize your character the way you like with Fashion Items, yet still functional as you can wear armor underneath. Event gift bundles give way to obtaining cute pets such as the Champion Wannabe Coco pet, a Christmas event reindeer pet.As much as the community varies, I have not once seen any foul language or explicit topics in the chat. This is amazing and absolutley does make a more enjoyable game experience. Teaming up with other players is fun and a good way to handle Instance Dungeons. All you have to do is click on them and click ""Invite to Party"". Once they accept all the party members are listed on the left side of the screen, along with how much HP/SP they have. The Party Window allows you to see where all your party members are, so if you end up in a rather confusing Instance Dungeon you can all keep track of what's going on. Enough about the community, the game itself is an amazing place to play, even solo. The tutorial is quick, but still tells you what you need to know, giving you enough time to get started playing, even if you don't have hours. Equiping things is simple and understand the game's physics is easy. I'm totally addicted (and at this point at level 135 thank you very much). Leveling up is easy and grinding for XP is incredibly profitable in The Link Between Time, an area designed to give you high XP rates for your level, however quests are the best way to level up. I used to think the amount of quests was painful, but I've realised they're there so I can level up and get Guild Points. Monsters have their own sound effects and so do each classes special skills. There are different classes and class advancements for everyone. I've heard of subclasses, except I'm a Soul Lord so I don't know what those are. Most classes have four class advancements, or so I've heard. What I'm trying to say is: this game is just so original and cute that it's highly addictive.There are a few more things I'd like to highlight:♥Fishing - Fishing is an incredibly relaxing and quite profitable thing to do, and the Rainbow Fishing Hole in Belos is exceptionally beautiful.♥The background music - The background music is simply gorgeous, and always fits the area it is used in.♥Guilds - Like-minded players, UNITE!Also, another thing, the storyline is intriguing and complex, with many different characters, each with their own personality. Take the situation between Iris, the Dark Moon Princess and Choen Pam.Overall, if you're looking for something to play, try this game. It comes at a very good price (I.E, free) and you'll enjoy it. Just take my word for it.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                            I'd like to finish with a Soul class quote                    ♥Alter your soul; the Darkness is my defence; overcome your cursed destiny and create your own path.♥~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Xx ~ <3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~			"

												You cannot play with your old LaTale account, you must create a new one to play on the Steam version!The game features 2D graphics, 1280x800 maximum resolution and an option to use fullscreen with black lines on the sides. The game has some things in common with Maplestory but it isn't a direct copy.The tutorial is very confusing so far. You must kill a monster to complete a quest in the tutorial, while 50 people are trying to do the same thing at once. Bad first experience when you start playing!Looting manually is very tedious, althrough obviously, there's some microtransaction pets that loots your items if you're into that kinda stuff... The game is very slow paced ( at the beginning anyway. ) It also make use of X-Trap... There's only 1 server with 7 channels as far as I can tell.I think it has potential though, and the game seems like it has a good amount of content! The character customization is easy to use, the skills have some unique looks that i've never seen in other MMOs... Personally I do not like it too much, but it is free to play, you can always try it out! Just remember that there is a cash shop and it is slower-paced than most games i've played recently.			"

												At first, I didn't really like the game. I thought it was too slow and the controls too delayed, but then when I gave it another chance and forged ahead I found an enjoyable experience. Whether your go solo or enjoy this game in a party of friends, you're sure to find yourself playing for longer than you'd think. As a Free to Play game, it isn't a Play to Win. You can put money into it if you enjoy it and have the change, but it isn't necessary at all to make an effective character. If you enjoy Maplestory or other similarly styled game, I highly recommend La Tale, as I personally find it more impacting and better designed than the former.			"

												La Tale is an overall pretty well-made KMMORPG. I immensely enjoyed the PvE in this game, but I think the PvP needs some improvements. The graphics are pretty cute, and character creation is also pretty well-done. The classes are creative, although some feel out of place. Overall, I would give this game a 8/10.			"

												This game is addictive.-It has a nice storyline to keep you interested.-It's like Maplestory but 2x times better :D-Cute graphics-The combat is actually pretty good and satysfing (especially when using skills, the animation is just so satysfing)-You will play alot, since there are like 200 levels or so XD.-The game does not have any cons except it's laggy at times and the PvP matching system is rarely used by low levels.(I got beaten by level 194 when I was level 16)-This game sums up the definition of ,,La'' perfectly and the community is just so nice.I play this game since season 1 in OGP and I met only 1 bad person :D (my cousin)Interesting crafting system, dungeons and bosses.-Many classes to choose from (Explorer upgrades into Gunslinger or Treasure hunter, Warrior upgrades into Blader or Warlord and every other class upgrades to something else) :D-This game is good for casuals and people that love challenge.-And it's not a ,,Pay to win"" game :D.-The GM's are really nice.This 2D side-scroller MMO is a really amazing experience and I would recommend it to anyone :D10/10 !UPDATE :  After playing more and more I started  to notice things I didn't before. The english translation is pretty bad at times, placing ,,he"" in places where it must be ,,she"".And your internet has to be pretty strong, the game is pretty lag sensitive and your character's moves won't be at the right timing if you have a weak internet.PvP matching system isn't so good, when I was level 16 I got beaten by a level 190+.So it's not the 10/10 I gave it. More like 8,4/10UPDATE 2 : After La Tale : Infinity came the game got all laggy and stuff and had lots of problems with X-Trap. They fixed everything and reworked some of the arts, there is a new class with a really interesting story (Card Master). They fixed some translation errors and translated the stuff that was still in Korean ^^. Game has gotten much better and the new class is amazing. You can now level up faster too. People used to have delayed movement due to laggy server but all of this is fixed now too.You can still get delayed movement if YOU lag!The game no longer has this problem for me.			"

												It should say something about this game when there is over 200 hours behind and more to come. This has to be the cutest pixel game ever without that player vs player grudge that seems to be issue with pretty much all multiplayer games there is.  -Though there is player vs player for those two like that kind of thing and main game is for people who like following story and even people who like to play single. You don't even need to purchase anything or any special items with money unless you really want to. It's like Torchlight; everything you will need you will most likely find it along the way, no matter what class you choose from.I have spent great time with this game and will continue doing so.Latest updates two years ago brought storyline updates to make beginning ""simple"" and ""easy. Some of the cool levels from the beginning got simplified though. Beginning basics got nerfed a lot.			"

												Latale is a 2-D MMORPG side scrolling game with similar elements to Maplestory. Graphics are cute, entertaining, and anime-like, but which may not appeal to everybody. The classes are diverse and various job advancements to choose and explore from such as a Warrior who will advance to eithier a Blader or a Warlord. Gameplay may be repetitive at times (I mean what MMO doesn't?), but keeps it entertaining with the animations of the skills. In my opinion, Latale has the best, if not, one of the best soundtracks which help shape the games atmosphere. Another great aspect of the game is the various emotions that keep the game diverse from other MMOs. Latale has one of the most friendliest community that I've experienced, which is probably another aspect on why I keep coming back to play.So see for yourself about the wonders of lataleNote: I've been playing Latale ever since 2009 on and off so I may not have any hours, or any on steam.

												The graphics look amazing, detailed even. The plot is nice and it keeps you on track, as opposed to how other MMOs would just throw you into the game leaving you to do random quests. The music is really nice, and the rewards are great. Leveling is pretty easy as well.The downsides? It's riddled with bugs, there's broken translations and clunky controls. And considering this game is in it's 2nd season, something tells me a lot of it won't be patched. Also, some of the quests can get repetitive. Go to a town. Get told to this this and this. Done? Go to the next town. Do the exact same thing but with different monsters. If you can ignore the bugs and the repetitiveness I totally recommend trying it out. Don't let how it looks like Maple Story scare you off. "

												Now I'm gonna keep this relatively simple, La Tale over the times has gone through many, MANY changes. I used to play the game when I was a lot younger and was once in love with the art style, gameplay and overall adorable vibes....I say used to for a reason. After forgetting the game for a few years and stumbling across it again I decided to pick it up again. Sadly, I was noticing small bugs in the game that had been around for as long as I remember.  One little thing that sometimes irked me was the delay on the running, sometimes your character is further ahead than it looks on your screen.Then the Tutorial has gone through several changes, to the point where it looks all muddled up. You're essentially being taught how to play in 5 different ways, which can easily confuse a younger or less experienced player.Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is still as nice as it always was, but the way the game sells itself now just feels like it's confused about what it wants to be. As a result, it can turn off a lot of unfamiliar players. So until they tidy it up some, I can't really recommend this game.			"

												Love this game and i still do, played it back in 00's and play it even now.Pros:1. Love the combat combo system, where you can chain many skills together, has slightly improved from recently playing at 1st it was a touch tricky to get it right (might be lag, not sure) but works correctly2. The class system has imporved a great deal since i last played in 09/10, added some interesting classes that i would like to play3. Dungeons/Instances is slighty less difficult (at level) the first one you come to is some fire dragon (i forget the name @_@) with a good party and PLENTY of pots/cookies/candy, after a certain point you can go back and farm the place for money/equips that you would like for yourself or to sell off to other players4. The story quest may or maynot have improved as far as the translatations form when i 1st played didnt care to read it back then :P but it does have a spice of comedy to it5. In-game money comes fairly quickly, just depends on fast you farm or do questsCon: 1. The cash shop pets do make it easier to quest, running in clearing a room and still get the drops, and farm for items while tryin not die misc. reasons the only issues is that for cash shop pets you need a cash shop pet revival item when it runs out2. Since the release on Steam there is no intergration between accounts, that im awear of so if you have a old account (like me) you cannot use it to play on Stream *insert rage emoticons*3. There is alot of kill this and collect that quest but i find that enjoyable, i cant say that for other people so it may effect other people negativelyOverall i still enjoy this game alot and the new additions has my curiosity to say the least, and ill be diving back into it again, maybe yall will find me runnin around zerging quests :poohappy:			"

												I would like to start by saying that we all have our own preferences when it comes to gaming, so never 100% go off of reviews.Anyway, this game is indeed Free-To-Play. You do not need to spend money in game, as of yet, to progress in the game. However, I instantly fell in love with this game, within the first 3 hours of gameplay, I spent a small bit of money on it. £6 ($10). With this, I managed to get an awesome gothic themed outfit, an adorable pet and some special items which lets me finish my quest without having to speak to the quest-giver. Which I think is fairly reasonable considering other games I've played, the tokens have cost tons more and you can't get nearly as much as this. The basic armour is particularly fashionable and not an eye-sore. The weapons are also considerably badass-looking. I'm currently using a Staff (I'm a Wizard) which I think looks a bit like one of Sailor Moon's weapons.Items are relatively easy to retrieve via looting, however most drops are junk items - the game tells you this in a little note in the item's description. Lag is extremely minimal. I may have d/ced from the server once or twice in the course of 12 hours. The game has multiple channels with about 7 or so servers within each, which really helps the lag spread out and, well, not lag.One thing that people will complain about is that this is a side-scroller. I am telling you now, it feels nothing like one of those. I know that sounds stupid considering it is in fact a side-scroller. But, it just doesn't really feel like one. The graphics are cute and very well done. I applaud the pixel artists and background artists that have put the effort into their job, it really shows. The music as well, extraordinarily beautiful. None of it is a slow, short and painful loop. Which I yet again commend, it never grates on your ears. Going back to the graphics, the attacks are fabulous. I feel as though some attacks aren't pixelated. The fire attacks I currently have don't look pixelated, which adds reality to the game. Some of the animations for the attacks are utterly adorable. For example, 'Bubble Bubble', your character uses a bubble blower to blow some bubbles. And afterwards their eyes go all wide and shiny. I love it. And something similar for 'Ice Spear', I think that's what it's called. The monsters are also very well pixelated, some of the pixelling in this game is gorgeous, and is enough to make you want to play.This game has a combo system which lets you get attacks in quicker. All moves are AOE, apart from your regular attack which makes mobbing all the more easy. I play an RPG where a mage has extremely limited AOE moves, painful I tell you. As you increase the combo, you'll get more exp. Levelling up seems to be easy. I'm already level 30, but the levels do go ridiculously high, I think I've seen a level 192?What I've met of the players, they all seem to be English and friendly. Most higher levels are normally snobbish and frown upon lower levels, but they help you out and treat you as an equal, as it should be in all games.The quests are very generic. Kill this, loot this, talk to this person. Which is one of the downsides to the game. I've already strayed from the quests as it is due to this. But I think most games are like this. Everyone eventually abandons the quests and goes off on their own. I think I've still got a level 3 quest there someone. Along with level 10s, 22s etc. You actually don't need the quests, however they do give you quite a bit of experience and 'Ely'. Which is the game's currency, much like most games is gold.The pets in this game don't attack. The highest level for them seems to be 20. Apparently, which I had to find out from a higher level player because the help guide wasn't much help, the egg hatches at level 5, the pet matures at level 10 and it can change its appearance or something. I can't fully recall. Different pets have different abilities. My current pet can open a shop at level 5 and at level 10 it will increase my magic and luck. When your pet reaches 100% exp, you must go and buy a supplement to level it. There are 4 different supplements which increase in price. Lvl 1-4 which is 10k; Lvl 5-9 which is 30k or so and it increases accordingly. I think it eventually gets to 100k or something ridiculous like that. The first pet you get through a quest is useless, cannot hatch and has no abilities whatsoever. I would say it's there to look pretty, but it doesn't even do that. It's an egg with wings, called 'Handsome Egg'. Utterly useless.To sum it all up, I would strongly recommend this game. But, remember my opening statement - 'I would like to start by saying that we all have our own preferences when it comes to gaming, so never 100% go off of reviews.'			"

												If you enjoy MMORPG's, this is the game for you.  Don't let the cutesy 2D anime graphics fool you, this game has tons of content that can keep you occupied for hours and hours.  I WILL say that the beginning of this game is quite tedious with the tutorial quest no lie, but after that it gets better as you level.    The thing that stood out in my opinion was the fact that there are so many classes to choose from, some that you would see in a typical mmorpg like Wizard or Warrior, and a few unique classes such as Soul Breaker and Engineer.        Each class also has at most 2 advancements to choose from when you reach level 50, which takes less than a week, don't worry.  Examples of the advancements include Warrior's having a choice of becoming either Warlord, which specializes in the spear or two-handed sword, or Blader, which specializes in dual blades.  Which would you prefer if you were warrior?  Slow, but Powerful?  Or Fast attack speed with damaging combos?  You decide.       I'm only talking about one class here too.  Even after 2nd Job advancements, the game takes it further with 3rd job advancements at lvl 100, then Sub-Class advancements at 140, and finally, the new edition 4th job classes at lvl 190.  Sounds like a long journey right?  It is.  However, with dedication and hard work, you too can gain 3rd job, and even 4th job too!        My highest level so far is Lvl 117, an Engistar (3rd job class Engineer), and im getting there, not giving up till I get that sub class! :)  Don't get me wrong, I don't play this game 24/7, I think of this game as a ""pick up and play it for a bit"" one.  Sure, you can just go all out and level to the max, but sometimes its best to take it slow, if you know what I mean.        AND, of course, play with your pals too!  The game is enjoyable to its fullest if you have a full party of friends, heck, even strangers, duking it out on the Instance Dungeon bosses with healing support, tanking, and damage dealing as the perfect team comp.      I Would talk more about La Tale, but, I'd just be going on and on xD.  So, with that in mind, see ya guys in game!IGNs on La Tale:  Valioa (lvl 140 Soul Lord),  And SacredBelmont (Lvl 123 Engistar)			"

												If your a fan of side scroller mmos this one is pretty good.  I personaly think that the movement pace is a little slow but they keep you moving pretty good on quests.  The inclusion of being able to buy fashion items with in game money is pretty cool too.  That being said it is plagued with micro transactions altho not nessisary still they are there. I suggest checking it out. i give it 7 1/2 on a 1 to 10 scale. give it a go its pretty fun.			"

												Is La Tale a better game than Maple Story? I don't think so. Putting aside every changes in both games, I could spend whole weeks playing Maple Story and it wouldn't made me bored at all. I can't sadly say same about La Tale. It feels like everything I do, uncluding just moving around, feels sometimes like playing while having heavy lags. Combat also feels slower. Maybe because of that I couldn't enjoy La Tale for longer time. But hey, it's free to play game, so install it and try it yourself - that's the best you can do.			"

												All I can say is:Latale's way to addicting, and it isn't a slow paced game -- teleportation with crystal-styled objects and quick levelling through quests.Although some quests are annoying (like 60 of ___), the game's other factors make it better.There's a large variety of weapons, armour, fashion items and even classes -- where there are four for a class chain in total and all but one can have a subclass.Latale's definitely a game that everyone who's into anime and/or sidescrolling 2D MMOs should try out. They'll get stuck to it, definitely.			"

Its cute 2D side scrolling mmorpg.It has lots of classes (not like in ragnarok, but anyways) and similar content, but lack of players (not actually, but biggest part of them already got lvlcap).Yep, battle system isnt perfect, but its still being fun little game to spend some evenings with friends or alone.

												First things first... (I have countless hours in this game being a closed beta player)You will not be using your old accounts with the steam version (Something they will be fixing or figuring out soon [Hopefully]).Second, if you arent in America you will be experiencing lag (It used to be way worse.... even for the American players).Alright so here we go...A lot of people will compare this to many similar games, the one best known will be Maplestory but lets stop right there...This game is what maplestory wish it could have been at its core. It is not pay to win.The community is friendly (90% every commnuity has its jerks).An active staff that listens to its players (Seriously, players have made concerns and had OP items nerfed because they felt an unfair advantage to things that were easier to acquire with cash).90% of everything is tradeable or farmable (non cash items that is, most cash is tradeable or giftable)Hackers... I honestly have never seen them and only heard of them in stories..Broken economy? No sir. Bots? A few spam bots but the game has block features which mute players.Now for a review.In short, You are a hero of the game (Not THE HERO... a hero), a young adventurer making your way in the world trying to figure out what happened to ""Iris Livier"" and her travelers. The story is in parts and along the way you unlock bits and pieces with semi deep quest lines and story telling (It honestly gets REALLY good towards end game). Like most MMORPGS you will be grinding and leveling. Questing and being challenged by dungeons and bosses (even special Time attack dungeons with bad♥♥♥♥♥music). There's lots of side things to do as well... Develop and perfect your playstyle!PVP!Join a guild. (Harvest guild crops and get to know your community!)Learn a profession.Mine your heart out.Fish forever!Dig! (Yes dig for items in any map that isnt in towns)Dance! (There's a dancing mini game!)Chill out.Be a merchant.And so much more...There's so much more freedom in this game than most other 2d MMORPGS...If you truly enjoy 2D MMORPGS then give this game a shot.. A REAL SHOT...			"

												 This game is something dear to me i've played it since it first came out in 2006 and stopped after a bit came back once it hit steam. So in all i've most likely played 350+ hours of this game. In all honesty it was my first mmo so my opinion might be a little skewed. But i would recommend this game to people as it is free so you have nothing to lose but be aware it's not for everyone and the community is kinda small but as a trade off most of them are nice. With the season 3 update it took away some good things and some bad things first off it made the maps smaller which is both a blessing and a bad thing some of the maps were insane to navagate correctly while some were really cool to explore well there a lot more simpler now. The second thing they did was change leveling for the better you can now quest up to high level instead of doing the grind of mob arenas. So in all honesty i would say try the game for a couple hours if it's not your  thing well you only lost a couple hours.			"

Love the controller support, makes playing so easy. Game isnt pay2win in my opinion just because there are usually events going on which will easily help you navigate around that aspect to a degree. I will say this though the game is a grind fest with a level cap of 200. So expect hours and hours of non stop grinding.			"

												La Tale is a free to play side scroller MMORPG.  Cute Anime styled artwork, Asian game design.  It worked after downloading. Might have connection problems with servers.I don't really play games like this, so i don't have an interest in this game.  People say it is like Maplestory.  Give it a try.La Tale is a 2D casual MMO sidescroller from Actoz Soft and OGPlanet aimed at younger players and those who love cute anime-style graphics. The fantasy tale concerns a mysterious woman named Iris, and the player must figure out what happened to her. There are several basic classes to choose from that later branch off into other subclasses, and many quests to complete. Advancement is mainly through questing and fighting monsters, as well as the main story thread concerning the long-lost Iris. There's also an ""affection system"" that grants bonuses. La Tale is free-to-play, but there are premium items available.FEATURESCute Anime Graphics | Cute, anime-inspired visuals in a side-scrolling console game style.Customizable Characters | Unique avatars that can be customized with all kinds of fashion items, equipment and pets.5 Class Types with a Multitude of Subclasses | Choose from the basic classes of Warrior, Explorer, Knight, Engineer, and Wizard, and advance your character to pick from a ton of subclasses like the Dragoon, Duelist, Minstrel, and much more.PvP | Engage in duels, or participate in PvP in the Elias Fight Arena to earn PvP-specific items and skills.for more info:http://latale.ogplanet.com/en/main.oghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Talehttp://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/La_Tale "

												Not reccomended for Oceanic players, movement delay(lag) makes the game unplayable.Methods such as TCPackFrequently and low vid mode do not fix the issue as it is an issue with the OGP servers/client that uses a silly method to send packets for every in game action (including movement) and this generates a delay of about 1-2seconds for simple movement keys. The only way for this to be fixed is either OGP creates a server closer to oceanic players or they recode the game client; both are unlikely.			"

												Quite honestly, this is more of a review for the Steam setup for this rather than the game itself. Why? Because after having seen this and having never played it before, despite having an OGplanet account, I decided to download it from Steam to give it a try. Now, long story short, I'm the sort who doesn't have alts. I have one main account I do my gaming on for every site, anything more being needed just seems unnecessary or boring to me. Now here's the thing. In order to play this game, since I have an OGplanet account already, I'd have to.. Make a second email address so I can make a new account. Why? Because Steam does not allow players to log in with existing OGplanet accounts.Yup.You legitimately cannot play this game through steam without making a brand new OGplanet account through steam.That is why this game can't be recommended. The idea of such a massive gaping hole in the ease of access, and the hassle it requires. Maybe for new players who don't mind making an account for OGplanet, then it really doesn't matter. But its still a rather silly 'release' on steam, and quite honestly, shouldn't be released like that to begin with, regardless of any kind of company-side issues.Again, this is just my review for 'La Tale on Steam'. Not La Tale itself. Which I can't play without going to download the game -again- on OGplanet itself so that I can use my existing account.			"

												A fair business model and fun action make this Korean MMO a pretty fun time.You start off with three character slots, which is pretty fair as additional ones are around $10 USD. The action is crisp and the controls are responsive, even during the very occasional lag. Classes are fun to play and varied between each other, and the stage areas are varied as well. The community is relatively helpful, and the world is beautifully done.The main con is the fact that it is /poorly/ translated. Don't think about getting any useful plot points out of the story, it's muddled and confusing at best. If you enjoy beating the crap out of adorable things with satisfying gameplay and controls, then this game is for you.			"

												This game is not recommended unless you enjoy your slow-moving, clunky feeling games. I got into this game and was instantly displeased with it as something as simple as the movement within the game feels horrible to interact with. This is entirely my personal opinino on the game as you can tell by my hours played (lol), so you can always go ahead and try this game out as it is free to play.However, I shall not be playing it again as the movement and also the combat system, as well as the lack of customisation really disappointed me. The art style is something to be proud of however, so that is one thing going for it. Again, just try it out yourself. It's definitely a game that will appeal to people that really just want to chill and take their time with a game.			"

 La Tale Review	Finally got around to write this review, this game is one of the few MMOs I actually like.Don't judge by my play time here.I've played for years on the OGPlanet Launcher. Story 	The story is rather simplistic.The story is centered around Iris Reviere and her party.She is an explorer with numerous adventures who made a name for herself.But one day, she suddenly disappeared without notice and no one knows where she actually is.She is the person that brings you in the world of La Tale and after that you are left on your own devices as you follow through her footsteps and in the process making it into your very own journey.That's it for the story I guess, there alot more since the story is really big for an MMO but this is just a summary of what you should expect. Gameplay	The gameplay in La Tale is great.The combat especially.It's dynamic, varied and fun.There are plenty of weapons to use depending on your class and each one has alot of combo variety. Some are more focused on supporting fellow party members instead of hitting hard.Some focus on dealing damage with your spells and actives while others focus on raw damage straight from your basic attacks and tankiness.There are alot of classes since every base class can go in 2 directions - either an upgrade of his defeault class or go on a totally different route with a completely new weapon.Forgot to mention.The game can get grindy depending on the class you are usingIf you use Card Master or Wanderer you will have a great experience as they level up extremely fast but with other classes you will level up slower.The game's level capacity is 250 if I am not mistaken. You could probably reach it in a month depending on the time you spent on this game. Graphics	The graphics are gorgeous in my opinion.Cute anime graphics with great pixelated art and particle effects.Attention to detail in artwork is alot and is really appreciated. Customization	Now, customization is really varied... that is if you are willing to pay ofcourse,You can still look unique without really paying but it will require hard work so you can farm enough Ely - the ingame free currency in order to buy Astro items from the market and other people.However 90% of the Astro items are purely cosmetics and do not make you stronger at all.Astro is the premium currency. Community	This game has the friendliest community I've seen in a game.The game advertises is self as the friendliest MMO and it does not lie.Every single person I have met her - I have had great time with them.Telling each other dirty jokes or grinding together while Music	Music is a joy to listen to, every track is beautiful and has it's own atmosphere.The music is the thing that makes La Tale feel like La Tale.It makes the game feel unique. (Despite being similar to MapleStory, lol... but judging how MapleStory is faring these days... you're better off with La Tale instead).			"

												This game is not that horrible. Its for people who pull up youtube videos while leveling their guy up, not so much for people looking for a rich gameplay and story experience. Not that the gameplay and story is bad, actually its pretty good. Unlike Maplestory where if you just touch an enemy it registers damage, enemies have attack animations. This makes a huge difference because it allows you to dodge the attack and counter. People may think that this does not make such a difference, but it does especially when there is a combo system which rewards you with money and exp for high combos. You even get a light attack, strong attack, jumpings attacks, blocks, and more. However, leveling and killing certain monsters (ones that don't stagger) are much more difficult, but fun. English translations are AWFUL like REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING BAD. Some npcs and items just have random symbols instead of words, however they are few and somewhat far between. Skills are pretty cool looking and interesting, however due to the lack of a LaTale youtube community, you will have to guess on what the skills does based on its description, which is sort of bad due to the translation errors. There is a fashion shop and some items do give you stat bonuses, but the cool thing about this game is that you can actually pay for special points (not cash shop points) using in game money to buy those items for a limited time (however you can keep buying them). Also due to the amazing amount of events and dedicated staff, you can actually get permanent cash shop items and stuff just for free! Now the main downside of this game is the really bad tutorial. They really dont tell you very much and its a lot better to find a high level character and ask him or her for help.All in all, 7/10. Get it if you like to watch youtube videos on the side while doing something somewhat productive.If you say Maplestory is better, this game is much harder and has better staff, but somewhat smaller community.

												This will most likely get a lot of hate-rate, but that's fine. Not everyone can handle the truth. Here goes:LaTale is a shameless Ragnarok Online rip-off with very little to no actual original content, with a dash of Maple Story. I'm surprised the developers of this game haven't been sued yet. This entire game reeks of impending lawsuit.When a game copies like 95% of another game's content, you'd think the game would be at least good. Nope. This game is basically the Walmart version of those games I mentioned earlier. Awkward controls. Uninspired storyline. Laggy servers. Non-newbie friendly quest tab interface. Offers literally nothing new. The only way this game could get any worse is if they shut down the entire game. Or wait, that could actually be a good thing.0/10 would spend 10 health potions trying to climb down a rope while tanking mobs again.			"

												First off, ignore the hours played; I have played this game for over 100 hours directly from their server. Unfortunately, since their server maintenance on August 19, 2015, gamers in Canada have been being disconnected constantly and experiencing lag issues. Very disappointing. OGPlanet had better fix this ASAP; people are rioting on the forums. Don't bother playing until they fix it. I'll change my recommendation when they do; this is a cute/fun game.			"

												I would play more of this game to get a better view of the overall experience but I would just like to talk about the new user experience for this game. When I started the tutorial it gave a ledge to give you something to learn jumping, however the message instructing you how to do this is off the screen until you go into the options and manually change the resolution, which for me made the window stretch below my menu bar. I could always play in full screen and probably get it back but for a game that starts up in windowed mode at the small resolution that doesn't show all the tutorial it's frustrating. (not to mention they don't tell you how to equip the 5-6 pieces of equipment you have from the start, but that might be my fault for not paying attention/ not playing long enough)I had issues with the game itself, such as not being able to end conversations with NPCs. I had to press the Escape key to exit  the conversation with the NPC literally every time I handed in or accepted a quest.  And after the first 5~ minutes the game became a quest per minute. obviously it would taper down after a while but for me it just made the quests become boring.Finally my last complaint is the movement is weird. It's like your character walks an extra step past wherever you try to go. Anyway, I'm sure despite these things this might be a good game but from my beggining experience I'm just not inclined to continue much farther. Not because I'm too lazy to learn how much I should move to get where I want or because pressing escape to end conversations gets annoying. It's because after 40 minutes I was so bored I just closed it and didn't want to open it again			"

												I wouldn't recommend ever even trying this. This game has some of the worse controls I've experienced. The normal walk speed is painfully slow. To run, you must double tap an arrow key. However, there is hardly a point to not be running, so why bother making the controls clunky when everyone just wants to run? Make the walk speed a toggle or something if you insist having two movement speeds. Aside from that, the skill trees are pretty flat and poorly laid out (hard to clearly see what skills progress into what other skills). Class descriptions in character creation are horribly lacking, so you don't really know what you're picking. The text they use for character names blends into the background, making finding NPCs a chore. Gameplay is pretty bland, though the possibility of comboing moves is there - so at least you have to mash more than one button to win. Quests are the typical kill x and collect y.HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO GET STUCK ON A ROPE FOR IT TO WORK PROPERLY? I swear, every other time I climb up a rope I go past the top of it slightly and get stuck in a looping climb animation until I go back down the rope a bit, then back up. This ruins game flow horribly. Combine this with the running issue described above and it just feels horrible.			"

												DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME I'm glad I was able to get this for free since when I actually decided to start the game it had to run through updates and download some anti-cheat software which I'm still skeptical of. When I actually did get into the game after going through the process of creating my character, I was barely able to move around at all and there was at least a 2 second delay between all my actions. I would press a key, wait, and watch my character move. That is incredibly bad since this is an action-platforming game which requires fluid movement. Also there is no controller support which is a shame since it would go perfectly with this style of gameplay. The worst part is I felt that there was lag at all times even though I was playing on a server with almost NO ONE on it. I'm still not sure if the game is supposed to be like this but if it is the control is terrible seeing as it took it a minute to recognize my inputs and I couldn't even climb a ladder which you need to do to get out of the first area of the game. I run, press jump button, my character jumps two steps too late. I had a hard time even getting out of the tutorial level. I didn't bother playing the game after that, not worth my time.			"

												I didn't level up very far to give a concrete review of the whole game but I was really excited to play it. The trailer looked amazing since I've always loved the Tales series games. The start of the game looked cute and I was interested in learning what happens next. Everything about the game is adorable from what I saw, the costumes and customization. Pets and such. Although, what really threw me off very quickly in the game is the controls. I can't tolerate the keyboard controls at all. It's too limited. You have to be placed a certain way to do things. Placing my character properly to climb a rope was the most annoying thing ever. I think if they did the controls more like how they do it in GaiaOnline, I would have wanted to keep playing the game. I'm sad though, the content was great. Only if it wasn't for those controls. :(			"

												I wanted to like this game because I usually like 2D MMOs, but this game is just unplayable.The first issue is the terrible translation. It's so bad that I can't understand the storyline at all, so I just skipped it. The tutorial questgivers are equally as bad but at least you can understand what they say, simple instructions after all. It's a shame that the initial questgiver doesn't tell you how to dash before instructing you to do so, becuase I spent forever scouring the menus to find which key you use to dash. Eventually I found it in the skills menu, and it said ""double tap directional arrows""... Would that have been so hard to put into the quest dialogue?I ran on a little further and it turned out this very instruction was on a signpost... But I had to navigate away from the questgiver to see that, so i'd only have known that if i'd given up on the quest already...Then it turned out that the person I handed the quest into was NOT the same person I got it from, but the game never told me that, so straight away I feel like i'm having to contort my brain to the game's logic. If I had known that the quest's end was to my right I would have ran on and expected more instruction, but as it was I was attempting to dash in place near the questgiver before having any idea how to do so. Did they even playtest this?One thing I noticed at this point is that my actions are delayed. I start holding the right arrow and only start moving a second later, and then once i've let go of the key, my character jumps forwards a few feet to where I would have been had the game responded in time when I first pressed the key. It's clear that these guys have no idea how to make an online game. Keep my movements smooth clientside, and upload them to the server. Instead what we have here is an unresponsive mess that keeps making me jump about to compensate for the lag.I attempted to set up an Xbox controller but the remapping tool made no sense, and required that you already knew the keyboard controls fully.The game only works in two resolutions, and for some reason the widescreen resolution will not work in full screen. Borderless in available, but it just floats in a tiny box in the middle of my monitor so what's the point? You can't even just maximise the window.The game doesn't explain it's skills system very well, and trying to get to grips with the combat proved frustrating, as did attempting to climb ladders and dodge enemies.Basically this game leaves a terrible first impression. So bad in fact that I don't think i'll be playing any more of it. Bad english, bad controls, bad lag, bad interface... Basically there's nothing worthwhile here.			"

												GMs who have nothing to do due to the lack of players, search your account to ban you for any reason, from arguing with P2W players to use dual accounts in login events.The movement is poor plus slow response to commands, Quest system is confusing, gold spammers in-game and in the forum, events are reserved for gacha users. Basically even the most powerful equipments in-game are useless without cash stuff like being inferior to a level 30 weapon overcashed(I'm not joking). And after you get your armor and weapon with nice enchants, worry not because you have to enchant 9 gems plus badges, necklaces and ETC.Once you get lv. 200, it becomes even harder to level than Ragnarok and Tibia (i'm not joking either).Let's see... People often do personal fights in the global chat and you can't block it, you're obligued to see they argue about who is more virgin.The previous dungeon system were quite good actually, but they ruined it in the other expansions. Once you log-in you'll see no newbies along you, so follow their example and don't play this game. If you want an anime MMORPG try Tree of Savior while Nexon didn't ruined it with cash stuff.			"

												It's a pretty good game, being a 2D side scroller MMO just like Maplestory. The graphics are pixelated, as expected, and rather adorable as well. The combat system and controls are quick to learn, but quite clunky at the beginning. Classes are very friendly, but just like its counterpart, it requires tons of mana potions to those that don't get a ton of it at the beginning. Even then, you'll need to switch over to them.La-Tale also has very good music. However, it does have it's bad side, and only one from what I can think about. The quests are too clunky and indirect, that is all I can say. Do I recommend it? No, the reason is due to the quest system and the fact the game requires a ton of reading to keep up with it, or else you'll find behind. However, if you're someone that loves to read, or whatever in a game, totally recommend this game. (knowing the majority of people, you'll be as lazy as I was and not read until its too late).			"

												It's a pretty good game, being a 2D side scroller MMO just like Maplestory. The graphics are pixelated, as expected, and rather adorable as well. The combat system and controls are quick to learn, but quite clunky at the beginning. Classes are very friendly, but just like its counterpart, it requires tons of mana potions to those that don't get a ton of it at the beginning. Even then, you'll need to switch over to them.La-Tale also has very good music. However, it does have it's bad side, and only one from what I can think about. The quests are too clunky and indirect, that is all I can say. Do I recommend it? No, the reason is due to the quest system and the fact the game requires a ton of reading to keep up with it, or else you'll find behind. However, if you're someone that loves to read, or whatever in a game, totally recommend this game. (knowing the majority of people, you'll be as lazy as I was and not read until its too late).			"

												Absolute trash. Initally, the deep, cool, dramatic piano music in the background of the character creation screen left me with a good impression audio-wise. After creating my character, smart-assily named ""ainsleyharriott"", the game transitioned into a cutscene. There were no moving objects during the cutscene, but characters talking to one another, with speech bubbles and such, manga style. Poorly written English left me with little to understand about the initial conflict.The beginning attack tutorial prompted me to press ""z"" for basic attack, for which I did. The character in the tutorial appeared to be fighting an immortal creature, exiled from both heaven and hell, apparently. Another character prompted the bow-wielding character (the character that you try to attack with ""z"" with) to leave the battle with the immortal creature. The game prompted me to tap the right arrow key twice in order to leave, for which I did. Twice. Nothing happened. Pressing the key did absolutely nothing, preventing me from advancing in the tutorial.Giving this 2/10 for the cool music at the beginning. Stick with Aura Kingdom, Mabinogi or Maple Story for good anime/chibi MMOS.			"

												What a disaster. Menus and dialogue don't make sense and the shop system is impossible to navigate. I couldn't tell if I was selling, buying, equipping; it's all an unlabeled, jumbled mess. And you still can't figure it out with help because the tutorials are incomprehensible word salad by someone who clearly doesn't speak English. Some buttons straight up don't work when clicked. Unintuitive controls that for some reason make you juggle both hands on the keyboard and also the mouse during the same menu tree. The only thing that isn't completely broken is the cute art. Someone please, correct me if I'm somehow wrong about this insane excuse for an MMO.			"

												La Fail - A Broken Unplayable Mess.This game is down right unplayable. If you even try to use the Keyboard and mouse to play, it will CRASH on you.If you try to use the Gamepad, you will notice that you're playing an MMO solo as you can absolutely NEVER chat to anyone. Because the moment you do, the game will crash. Doesn't matter when you hit a button either.If you're an old player coming back to it because it's on Steam now, avoid the steam version as you will be forced to make a new account anyway.Other than the broken unplayable mess, La Tale is an simply another attempt at a MapleStory knock off (otherwise known as a Clone). However, it has slower gameplay and more sluggish feeling attacks. While I do enjoy the Combo-like system it has and can make for great burst kills, that's pretty much all there is to it. There is more open ended character choices as some characters can have 4 different ways to be built; ultimately they will be lackluster as they aren't made solely with one thing in mind.It's better than Wind Slayer but far from being better than MapleStory. 5.5/10			"

												La Tale is really cute and really fun at first, but it has a few major flaws.First of all, the combat is quite entertaining. All of the abilities and attacks look appealing and feel satisfying to use.Customization is limited, but you can still come up with something super kawaii.The player base feels small, but you can still find people and likely make a few friends to queue up with for dungeons.I've never actually completed a dungeon, however, since I could not find the appropriate number of people; therefore, I can't talk about that much. What I can say, though, is that they are challenging and likely equivalent to your typical WoW dungeon.But now flaws...First of all, there's this whole ""you can only keep this item for x days"" thing which is kinda disappointing when the item is a good weapon that you were given for completing a quest.Speaking of which, quests are repetitive fetch quests and are the exact same in each zone. Collect special drops from x, y, and z monsters twice, rinse, repeat.The game is also rather glitchy in that some text is buggy like once I had a staff that basically had glitchy text as it's name. There are also minor things indicating poor translation or a lack of polish like when your character shouts, ""Icicle Fear"" when casting Icicle Spear.Worst of all is that nothing is ever really clear. For instance, you might pick up an item saying that it does nothing when it is actually pretty important or is used in crafting. But you wouldn't know that until you just randomly discover it since there's no information online.Lastly, I got some random virus which only appeared after downloading the game and disappeared after uninstalling, so players beware.The game is fun, but if you're looking for a fun, anime RPG, maybe look elsewhere since this is honestly one in a thousand. 5.5/10(Minus a few extra points for virus if you want)			"

												So I wasted some time installing this game on my crappy laptop, only to discover that La Tale is very much like Maple Story. Now that's all fine and well if you like such games of the side-scrolling 2D sub-genre, but it's really not my cup of tea. More importantly, there was one major problem: I couldn't even turn in quests. Dialogue screens of NPCs just turned up empty with no complete option at all - not all of them, but it happened too often. Finding your perspectives was kind of troublesome as well and I caught myself more running and jumping around, trying to figure out where to go next, than actually making progress.			"

												I was promised 40+ classes and welcomed with about 7. Dissapointment as soon as i start the game. I mean maybe you have to get farther in the game to get the other ones,but i doubt it. Almost nobody played this game when i started, and for some reason i think i could only connect to one server. I start the game seeing characters i have absolutely no context for, and a confusing prologue that teaches you confusing controls and alot of ''Use the arrow keys and reach for the mouse everytime you need to talk to somebody'' And i mean a lot of it. So ignore it and start the game. A red power ranger i have absolutely NO F**KING CONTEXT FOR. I walk up to him to talk to him, the game crashes. I now understand why the game is only 1 GB big. I am not saying i dont recommend this, since some people might not mind not having the promised classes, not understanding what the hell is going on or playing with a lot of other people. It also might run more stable on other PCs, but i got mine not even a week ago. So if you dont mind an empty, fake promising, confusing and unstable game, then have a blast.			"

												The game is ok. The problem starts with the inability to change the resolution until after you create a character, but if you cant click ""next"" you will have a frustrating time trying to figure it out. Sure you can change the resolution on your desktop, but if you are like me, with a wide screen, you will have trouble. But if that wasnt enough of a headache, the tutorial quests are terrible. Very little information, and very little instructions, I found my self lost very quickly, within the first 5 levels. The graphics are ""cute"" and I would play it if the devs put a little more time into fixing some of the small things with the tutorial quests, as well as the inability to access options in the main menu. As it stands though, I would have to give this game a 4 out of 10, it has potential, but also has problems.			"

												Total crap. I heard so many good reviews about this game, I thought I would give it a try. Worst mistake ever. The quests are boring, the mechanics are awful, and you can actually die against the first monsters in the game. Do yourself a favor. Play Elsword instead if you want to do a sidescroller. It's 1000 times better.Edit: After trying a few of their other games, just avoid OGPlanet altogether. I've seen better stuff come out of RPG Makers.			"

												If your personal fantasy is to have your eyes assaulted by what can only be described as a unicorn wetdream on LSD, then you'll probably enjoy this 'game'.I use the term 'game' lightly, as my experience can only be described as initially being hand-held like a bald-headed child with some sort of mental disorder through the most basic of tasks (walking left-to-right, climbing a ladder, not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself), only to find myself afterwards being thrown head-first into a moshpit of anime girls and boys, with seizure inducing fancy effects. After being treated like a limp-footed mental case, to be then thrown into one of a million brightly coloured menus, characters, obscure quests and overly-attached Power Rangers, to say that I was confused and overwhelmed would be an understatement. Imagine listening to anything by Skrillex without being on some sort of party-drug.Between the hundreds of anime look-a-likes forming a blockade between you and making sense of where you actually are, the glowing icons, incomprehensible menus and quests, the frankly bizarre dialogue and the somewhat disturbing music (clealy the result of multi-generation JRPG inbreeding), you'll find yourself wanting to commit seppuku at an alarming rate.If you're 8 years old, a brony, or perhaps someone who enjoys self-torture, then this will probably be an epileptic treat. If you want to keep your sanity or dignity intact, then stay away.			"

If you're in South America, don't even play this game. Otherwise, consider it.+ Nice concept+ Nice classes+ Less 'gayer' More manlier than other side-scroller games- Awful customization- Weird buttons- Lag! Delay! Lots of!- You can't play with your official OGPlanet accountPROS1. Very good conceptThe game itself has a nice concept. It's a sidescroller RPG just like MapleStory, Wonderking or WindSlayer (I think that's the name, lol), which means that although some monsters are strong you can regroup better on platforms and hit them better without having to look your back. That's fun and it's basically the concept I liked most. I'm not saying that non-platform games are better or worse, no, that's just my personal opinion.2. Nice classesThe game today has nice classes. About to five classes with small subdivisions between them (for example my class is an explorer but I follow the archer skill-tree pathway or I'm a knight that uses the shield, etc). It's waaaay better than Tibia some games that have about to three classes or MapleStory other games that have about to 31! This game classes amount is... enough.3. Nice visualThis game has a nice outfit if compared to other side scrollers. At most of them your head is quite big and disproporcional if related to your body and it looks like you're a child and the only difference between male and female characters are the hair (in some other games the female characters don't even have breasts). LaTale got a point in topic 3, characters seem more normal, less bizarre. I know that look like a useless topic but it's not, sometimes the game has to prove itself that it's worthy to play, even with those ""useless"" outfits.CONS4. Weird sprites Your character is awful customizable. You have about to 7 options of picking your hair, 4 options for your skin and so on. That's not bad if looked that way but sometimes in cities you face layers with extremely bizarre combination of sets. I know, it's their lives, not mine -- I know, but seeing that only makes me think that the developers are making all effort to earn money in all possible way. FFS I've seen a girl with a following shadow-skull beneath her, other time I saw a guy with a bigger than him sword. Maybe I'm too rigid with those things in games or maybe I'm right.5. Weird buttonsThe buttons are somehow weird. You pick items up with the V button, in the bottom middle of the keyboard, making yourself get messed up sometimes and you don't pick it all! Neverthless when it's only one (ONE, I repeat) item laying in the ground a pop-up opens and it shows the SINGLE item and the options to pick it or not. Jeez, if I pushed V I want to pick it, no more asking, ok?6. DelaaayThis one made me sad. It was the only negative aspect of this game that didn't allow me to play normally. Although I've listed about two other negative aspects, I could play the game with them with no problem at all since the game's not that bad and it seems quite funny. Those problems were minimal. But the delay for me (I live in Brazil with a 15 Mbps connexion) was incredibly huge, very huge. Way to huge (no, really, huge). The delay was so big in a manner that I couldn't farm level 1 monsters precisely, I had about to 1500 ms ping! My character jumped right after the jump button was already released and I attacked right after I released the button too! OGPlanet probably has a plausible reason for allowing brazilian players play with so much delay but that's not the point. Delay is tolerable until a point (around 250 ms average) but, really, I can't play. There's no way to gather friends or a party to fight a boss if it takes more than one second for the controllers to respond. Sometimes it lagged too. It's sad to see a game with such potencial not being played due to delay. If OGP fixes this issue I promise I remove this ngative review but by this point I feel like I have a moral obbligation to warn anyone who reads this. Thank you for your reading.7. The needing of creating another accountThis topic is somehow related to topic 6. I played LaTale in 2012 because I wanted to try the game and I had the same lag and delay problem. Okay, I quit and today -2014- I saw there was LaTale here on Steam and I downloaded it since it was free to play. But when I pressed play it said I couldn't because there was another account with my name and another e-mail registered as mine. WTF, that's MY account, I'm not hacking or stealing anything from anyone, I'm just accesing MY account. But I couldn't, I had to create a different nick and create a new e-mail to register the account to. Was it really necessary?			"

												Honestly, what is the point in putting your game onto Steam to try and attract a new userbase if you're not going to fix the glaring problems that this game has had since launch?Still laggy? Yep!Still terrible resolution options? Yep!Still that horrible input delay where it feels like your character is doing something half a second after you instruct them to? Yep!Still running really rubbish events that are in no way designed to reward the userbase, but are instead designed to try and claw money from you unless you're willing to pump an ungodly amount of hours into the game? Yep!Still an absolute chore of a grind? Yep! (even Maple Story's devs realised at one point that the grind was ridiculous and adjusted accordingly) Oh wait, I'm guessing that finally you're realising that the game is all but dead, there are far better alternatives out there (ElSword, Dragonica, Maple Story), and this is a last chance to try and scrape some cash. Honestly wouldn't waste your time folks, with all the problems that have persisted through the game's entire history, the only way you could possibly enjoy this to any extent is if it's your first ever MMO Platformer/RPG, or you've got more money than sense.Only positive thing I can say about this game is that it does have some damn nice spritework. Unfortunately, that's all it has.Avoid/10			"

												This is one of the saddest excuses for a game I've ever seen. In a desperate attempt to mix anime with MMORPGs, La Tale was born. Raised by Hades and and gifted to South Korea, this game is yet another horrible attempt to mix anime with anything.Seriously though, the game's community (can it be called that?) is of egostical children looting their parents' wallets for ingame-currency to buy random crap. What they do with said random crap is they stand around in the main area for players to feed their ego as players will (inevitably) shift their gaze to the players with the shiny horse-badger hybrid pet thing.Enough about the community, the game itself is an embarrassment. The tutorial is both vague and brief giving you not nearly enough information for the best game experience. To even equip things and understand the game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics I had to be lectured by a friend (who's totally addicted and at this point probably at level 100 or something). I have nothing against the time it takes to level up but grinding for XP is the most horrible experience. After you've killed the first thousand gelatin cube enemies the sound of squelching becomes almost demonic. What I'm trying to say is: there's a low variety of monsters and enemies to battle.Anyway, don't get this game. Just take my word for it.			"

												Played this game for about two days and got bored of it. There are no real unique elements; and to me it just appears as though this game is a lesser version of MapleStory. Overall, I couldn't really find any special aspects or differentials from other 2D side scrolling games. It's very easy to lose interest.			"

												Closet I have come to putting a gun in my mouth.... Seems like a bunch of 12 year old children with their budget from a paper route have come together to create a game... I maybe lasted 10 minutes without my ears bleeding from the horrendous music. Combat is clunky as can be and the chance of getting quest items from any mob is a one in a million chance. Nearly zero to no quest guidance. ""Great variety in quests"" Kill ""x"" amount of mobs, turn in, repeat. Just an awful game and not even worth the 2 minutes it takes to download. Steam should be ashamed to even have this available to their players.			"

												why is this on steam let alone exist in the first placeclunky ui, clunky controls, in fact everything in this game is clunky, not to mention obscure and confusing. Hotkeys are mostly mapped to useless things and are often times confusing and wonder why the hell they're mapped to the keys they are. even the thing that shouldnt really be confusing or just frustrating to use is the quest ui and systemand all i see in the main town is people, for some reason, who managed to play more than 10 minutes of this game sitting around in their particle effect shower of♥♥♥♥♥♥doing nothing. good work game. im legit confused at how people could stomach something like this? there are plenty of alternatives that play like this that actually work like you'd expect a normal game to work.10/10 ♥♥♥♥ing amazing game, not frustrating at all, game of the year, game of the century, better than morrowind or quake or anything, this is the best game of all time. I would like it to be renamed though, the name it currently has doesnt make sense, i'd reccomend naming it ""WHY"" simulator, because while i was ""playing"" this all I was yelling was ""WHY""			"

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!I did not even get to play the game, from what I can see the game itself looks good but they use this cut-rate anti-cheat system called ""X-Trap"" which is notoriously inaccurate.  I have had issues with x-trap games before but never on this level of ridiculous.First it told me Sandboxie is a cheat program, which it’s not. It’s used to run suspicious files in a safe virtual environment to keep your computer safe. But I could possibly see someone misusing it. OK.Then it tells me notepad is a cheat program... that’s ridiculous as hell. But OK.Then it tells me Nod32: MY ANTIVIRUS is a cheat program.... I’m ready to quit but I shut it down and try one last time.This final time hits the nail on the head. X-trap actually tells me Explorer.exe which is main shell for WINDOWS is a cheat program.... well forget that I’m uninstalling this game and telling my 3 friends I was gonna have join me, that it’s not worth the time.The game may be great, but their anti-cheat system is so disruptive it is impossible to play.

												La Tale is like a wasted delicious cookie that you have left to rot on a table.Back when 5:4 screen were common, it was seen as really great. Good gameplay, good servers, good time.Now, we're still forced with that 5:4 ratio... even on laptops. This means no widescreen support. The graphic engine is broken and doesn't recognize most of the recent graphic card drivers whenever the user try to run the game on fullscreen with the highest resolution.The solution officially given was ""Play on a lower resolution"" which means, for most, being forced to play on 800x600 or 1024x768. This game is run by, now, talentless devellopers who never accepted to evolve their product. It's a ghost of its previous glorious self.If you're not playing with a 8 years old computer or on a 5:4 ratio screen, I highly suggest to stay clear from this (technically) piece of crap. Yeah, its style and gameplay footage might be attracting, but that's all there is to it. You have been warned and if you ever lost dozen of hours trying to find the right support and having fixes done... in the next 6 month. Have fun.I'm out.			"

												I didn't buy into the negative reviews of this, since it looked more appealing to me after my frustrations with MapleStory. Sadly, many of the reviews about La Tale are true.I'll just summarize the entire time I played this game right now:1. Get quest.2. Kill monster(s) nearby for the quest, get the items needed.3. Return to person who gave you quest. Get items and exp. Level up, distribute stat points.4. Move onto next person to give you quest (or many times the same person who gave you the last quest).5. Repeat steps 2 and 3.6. Repeat everything above.Quite literally every single second I played was the above steps. No variation, no exploring. Walk from one end of a map to the other, killing everything, waiting for things to respawn, and kill them again. It's fun for a couple hours, then you realize it's the same thing endlessly, and then you stop playing. Disappointing. I liked the design of many characters, of the enemies, the areas, etc. But they won't save this endless, monotonous grind-fest.			"

												Alright guys? Well let me be honest with you, I wouldn't recommend anybody playing this game what so ever.  In such a case i would, it would only be if -------------------------------------------1. you love reading lots of text at the start of the game.2. Perfer visual novels over an actual game.3. love Maple Story copies. -------------------------------------------If you fall under those three catagories, then go play the game. If not then well like i said its not worth playing something with such a boring intro where you can't even get into the game. IThe first 5 mins i was super bored by all the text without any combat. When i did get to the combat it wasn't evne worth it. Get guildwars 2, its free and much better than this.  Enjoy			"

												This game is so bad... Players stealing your kills is just expected. Description lies about the number of classes (there are only 26 jobs and 6 actual classes). The UI and gameplay is horrible, Other players block you from completing quests, and you have to click constantly in it. Maplestory and Elsword are similar games, but so much better than this one. The music gives you a headache in 5 minutes, the tutorial is horrible, and there is absolutley no immersion into the game. All the characters are pretty much the same, and have no background specific to them. Quests are more of a hassle than an accomplishment, completing any quest is a chore. It has horrible graphics as well. At least in maplestory you can see what your doing, in this game nope, and the textures feel like they were thrown together at random. If you want to play a 2D MMO choose any other game, ZOMG!(not on steam), Maplestory, and Elsword are all so much better than this...			"

												Why you should play latale :1. You don't2. Tutorial is not separate instance with requirement to finish (can't skip), there is a quest in tutorial where you need to kill a stickman, and its shared by 9001 other tutorial player, so you get the image. Cluster**** is the right word. If you can't kill it you don't pass the tutorial : you cannot advance3. Assuming you pass those stage the first spawn are after tutorial is NOT a separate instance, therefore the questing npc is being swarmed by a bunch of people like you. Also a lot of annoying effects from ""advance"" player cluttering the screen if thats not enough sound effect spam also exists. ** By this point if you still want to play the game i condone you as a masochist **4.  The questing system is a bad joke similar to how your dad make jokes about your mum. So basically questing is a text base questing with little to no hand holding on where to go (which is not a bad thing) but of course with the spawn area cluster**** hand holding is little more necessary since you can't even see whats going on the screen.Also questing feels dead. like dead. I mean dead. You click, click go to here buy that, kill that, gather that. Yep.** By this point if you still want to play the game you might consider checking your head, go to doctor **5. So there is a lot of 2d mmo around yeah, well known one like maple story or stuff. Compare to them the movement in this game feels like lifting weight while running, you get what i mean ? Yep, clunky.			"

Neither my laptop's arrow keys, nor WASD, nor any other key produced any response from the LaTale Client.How did their playtesters fail to notice a gamekilling bug in the opening cutscene?

((actual review))All in all before i go for this evening, this game is terrible and if this post is removed its shows the hypocracy of the game developers to not be able to see the blatent distaster of a game they have created. This game sexualizes underage girls in a manner that belongs steryotypicaly in japan and other Eastern countries, thus leading me to the conclusion that this game has some oriental enfluences not to be racisit but its true, for ♥♥♥♥s sake cant look at a school girl the same way again after some of the japanese♥♥♥♥♥♥I find ont eh internet accidently. Regaurdless this game was horrible to play, and was poorly constructed for what its worht over all this game is not worth taking up space on steam due to how prestigous and famous it has become, they should raise their standards for free to play games instead of placing monstrosities such as this on its listings. THis is something that belongs on Origin not Steam((end of actuall review happy readingXD))10/10 BEST GAME OF THE YEAR FOR 1967MADE ON THE WORLDS FIRST COMPUTER COMPRISED OF MY PUBIC HAIRLICK MY BALLS IF YOU TAKE THIS DOWN YOU CHEEKY FEDORA WEARRING SCRUBLORDSSIGNED:The Great JaggiPS:DEVELOPERS I AM GOING TO MOLEST YOUR CHILDREN((JK ILL LET YOUR PATHETIC FANBASE DO IT FOR ME OR EVEN YOU BECAUSE YOU CAME UP WITH THIS PEACE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥)			"

												Though I haven't played the game much, it is very interesting and very, VERY cute. Unlike MapleStory (GaypleStory in my case), La Tale shows that you can play an Anime orientated game and enjoy it WITHOUT having to pay a single cent for game progression (a.k.a. Elsword). The only problem: not Australian player friendly due to the lag. Seriously, if I move left, it takes 1.3 seconds for the game to show effect. Don't blame my internet, it's 40.5 Mbps. So until the server is fixed for us players who live in the down under, the game isn't recommended from my perspective.			"

												As a big fan of maplestory, I can say this game can be the spiritual successor to it. It has fantastic rpg elements with loads of options and stuff that can keep you busy for days (but i aint got no time for that anyway), this game is a must play. the fact that a free to play rpg is not a pay to win just keeps my day shining.+great gameplay+impressive pixel art+unique classes that change gameplay styles+alot of unnecessary but cool options (ex: a pet automatically picking items for you, enchanting your pet to give you permanent bonuses)however the only complaints i have are these two:-weird design descisions (for example, when you start the game it tells you to jump over a small area, it says ABOVE that small area how to jump, but i couldn't see that sign when i was still behind the rock.)-the game doesn't help you understand alot of things (for example, there is a stat called ""luck"" at the start of the game that changes based on your class, the game doesn't say the effects of that stat (the effect i didn't know was that luck increases money earned from monsters), another example is that i didn't know the difference between stamina (which i assumed was the SP bar), and magic (which i also assumed was the SP bar???). this is also a weird design descision.eitherway good or bad i highly recommend this game, as a free to play you should have nothing stopping you from trying this mmorpg out. this is my favorite 2D mmo and i am very impressed by its mechanics. though some things are stopping this game from being the best.8.5/10			"

												An amazing world anybody can dive right into.There are many different classes, but it can be kind of boring spamming the same attack to clear monsters.

												I played this game a while ago but stopped playing due to many bugs and various things. I decided to come back and give it a go again though and yeah same disappointment.The main thing that really annoys me is it always freezes a lot mainly with walking across the screen it tends to get stuck. When fighting monsters you tend to freeze up and die or walk too far that you fall completely off. Another thing to mention is sometimes when you go up a ladder/rope you get stuck and can't get off so you have to go back down the rope and attempt to get off again. Other than that though it is a great 2D/3D sidescrolling mmo, but it's not very unique IMO.But I will say the one great thing about this game the most is I think is it's community they are really nice players.

												Playing from New Zealand, I always struggle with connectivity to a variety of MMO servers. This one is no exception. As soon as I was able to play, I noticed immediately the sluggish movement of my character. If there was an option to get a good connection to the server, I would've found it more fun to play.In terms of the actual gameplay, the concept shares elements from Maple Story, which I spent a fair few hours playing and cannot fault the concept. I just wish that games such as this were offering solutions to Oceanic gamers more.			"

												LaTale is beautiful game with ton of stuff to do. Let's start the review with simple pros and cons.+Pros of this game:+Classes = Many good classes with various skills and abilities+World = World in LaTale is really nice with ton of variety from forest through ancient temples to train with rats ? K. LaTale also have a lot of dungeons and event locations.+Items = LaTale have some coolest looking weapons and armors i've ever seen in online games.+Music = Love it Big+ Comunity = Comunity is really amazing in this game when you need help someone will help you (sometimes for free sometimes not)+Real money shop (Fashion store) = In this shop you can find some special fashion stuff (Mostly permanent) and some evet boxes nothing overpowered that would make this game pay2win.Cons:-Translations = Some text in the game is still not translated to English-Resolutions = only 3 options-Grind = You need money or XP or equipment ? Prepare for a looooooong grind. Or buy a lot of ring chargers from Fashion shop.- Customization = Some more customization while creating the character would be nice.In the end i think LaTale is a great game and i had a lot of fun with it. I played on OGP (not the stem verson obviously) and i still have a Der Freischutz lv 187 with some decent equipment.			"

												Interesting concept, but the execution is rough at best and a failure at the worst. The core of the problem is awful controls, and no obvious way to go and change the controls. The Keyboard works... after you get used to the really bizarre setup, but the USB controller is down right perplexing. Start button is jump? Why? And why is this system using a 1 through 10 power setup? This game is a side scroller, implying fast action with little thought about your three dimensional placement. Turn those into button combo moves, tighten up the control scheme, and you'll have a good game. Right now, because of these major faults, all it manages to do is look neat until you try playing it...			"

												It's a fairly generic MMO, similar to games like MapleStory. Despite that, I find it a lot more fun than that. Unlike games like MapleStory, the progression is a bit more obvious. Therefore, you don't really have to pay much attention to the actual game to keep going, and can just do other things while mashing your number keys and going from quest giver to quest giver. I've spent over 100 hours in this game in under a week, and I don't feel burnt out about it. If you have free time up the wazoo, and can get lost in MMOs easily, go wild.7/10			"

												7/10 - Anime Maple StoryI was a player long ago and thanks to Stream, I got back into it and I forget how fun it was. And thanks to the gamepad surport, I enjoy it even more. Sure it the normal hunt-things MMORPG that most Free-to-Play RPG are but the combat and skills are simple enjoyment and the class and weapons are very nice. Downside to this is the lags I get most of the time due to how many monsters and players are on ths screen and the lack of more better quest just make the game more repetitive. Also the costume cost a lot. Need to dish out ton of cash to look cute, cool or whatever and same goes the pets. A nice, simple 2D MMORPG. So simple, I only played it to kill some hours. I mostly enjoy playing solo and this was the right game for that. Luckily, most people won't talk to you unless they want to make a party and become life-lone online friends or whatever.....I don't need your friendship. I just want my new cool guns at Lvl. 120			"

												Up Sides: This is not only an awesome fun game, but it give you that classic story feel. even though it's a side scroller you don't mind. LaTale is cute and yet has a depth that can easily be overlooked. Be warned it is very addictive once you start you won't want to stop!Down Sides: it won't work very well with controllers and it's hard to get through tough dungeons if you play solo and the worst part is if you already have a file you can't carry it over to steam you have to start a new one with an email not assigned to an account yet.

												7/10 - Anime Maple StoryI was a player long ago and thanks to Stream, I got back into it and I forget how fun it was. And thanks to the gamepad surport, I enjoy it even more. Sure it the normal hunt-things MMORPG that most Free-to-Play RPG are but the combat and skills are simple enjoyment and the class and weapons are very nice. Downside to this is the lags I get most of the time due to how many monsters and players are on ths screen and the lack of more better quest just make the game more repetitive. Also the costume cost a lot. Need to dish out ton of cash to look cute, cool or whatever and same goes the pets. A nice, simple 2D MMORPG. So simple, I only played it to kill some hours. I mostly enjoy playing solo and this was the right game for that. Luckily, most people won't talk to you unless they want to make a party and become life-lone online friends or whatever.....I don't need your friendship. I just want my new cool guns at Lvl. 120			"

												as a player of when la tale first came out i find the knight class enjoyable back then unlike compared to after all the updates. I say this because i highly dislike the fighting effects with the knuckls and the fact that i had no knowladge of them now handing out wepons through level up packages. I do not recommend this game if your an old player and wanting to come back but could possibly recomend it for thoes of them that arrived during the updates of early to late season 2 to early season 3...

												Edit: (03/03/16) The latency has become a horrible problem and is starting to hinder the ability to play. I have played this game off and on for years now with long periods of down time. I loved the structure of the game, but the implementation of the way it all worked had always felt wrong or slightly off. Getting back into the game, things feel smoother and as they should be. Maps flow excellently now, quests are considerably easier to understand, leveling up is not a total chore right from the get-go, making money isn't an exhausting issue, many things seem to be in nice places with more proper labels. Compared to what the game is now, LaTale felt much, much more unorganized when I last played. The classes are still flashy and fun to play, and I see some skill animation changes have come around too which is really nice. (Warrior's heavy attack is not some clunky slow swing now)All in all, LaTale is getting to a point where it honestly should have been at a long time. But hey, better late than never. Give this game a shot if you enjoy(ed) Maplestory.Edit: Okay, I do see what other people mean about the translations being poor. They definitely need to be revised for proper English. It looks like some Asian kids with a terrible understanding of English wrote more than half of the scripts for the NPC's. One character even says something in a different language but spelled with English letters. That's just...massively stupid... I believe that's called Singlish? idk, needs to be fixed.			"

												I do recommend this game, BUT there's some things that are bad.First off, the good things. It's easy to level up in this game. I had a level 5 soul-stealer that could take down enemies that were level 8-11. If you aren't beating down enemies to level up, then quests are the easiest things to do. You can get 1,000 exp. to 3,000 exp. just for gathering materials or killing a certain amount of enemies. It's really easy and it's fun to do.Now, the bad things. The hundreds of customization the game offered can only be bought using a special currency which costs $5.00 for 100 of these special coins. You don't get complete outfits, you have to buy a seperate top and bottom which are around 30 of the coins. you could maybe buy only 3 items from the shop if you just bought 100 coins. The tops and bottoms offered using the free currency aren't the prettiest things. Also, in order to get at least some decent looking items, you have to do surveys and receive tokens which are only 1 per ""quiz"". you need at least 30 for a top or bottom using these tokens too. So, I don't suggest wasting your money on the clothing options, just use the free money to get armor or weapons. Other than that, this game is sort of like Maple Story. It's unique in it's own ways, but it's also very similar. If you like Maple story or just 2D platformers that are MMORPGs then you'll like this game.			"

												One of those side scrolling games which just gets you lost playing it...its really fun if you just wanna...well have fun...overall the game mechanics are easy to understand and very simple and it's got a good community. The character customization is not limited which makes it interesting.The game encourages you to level up your character and not get bored of it since it gives you rewards like unlocking skills and various abilities and not just improving your stats. So if your into playing something like a 2D side scrolling action game from time to time,then trying this game out is really worth it.			"

												La Tale is a simple side-scrolling game most comparable to Maplestory back in its younger years. You start out by picking one of the classic RPG classes, which then can be advanced into an even better class at level 80. The quests are simple; kill 'x' amount of monsters or get this item from so-and-so or go to this NPC. It isn't that difficult to level up in, and the storyline is easy to understand despite the grammar lost in translation. Despite the massive amount of grinding done, it isn't that painful and the game makes it relaxing. The quirky yet colorful graphics are anime/manga-like, and the colors for equipment and such aren't gender restricted. I highly reccomend that everyone reading this review should try the game for at least five to ten minutes; even if it's not your cup of tea.			"

												Interesting concept, but the execution is rough at best and a failure at the worst. The core of the problem is awful controls, and no obvious way to go and change the controls. The Keyboard works... after you get used to the really bizarre setup, but the USB controller is down right perplexing. Start button is jump? Why? And why is this system using a 1 through 10 power setup? This game is a side scroller, implying fast action with little thought about your three dimensional placement. Turn those into button combo moves, tighten up the control scheme, and you'll have a good game. Right now, because of these major faults, all it manages to do is look neat until you try playing it...			"

Mostly veteran players selling things 24/7The community is really pretty dead, Considereing what it used to be.Really pay to win, You can pay to be strong if you buy certain Fashion sets; if you try to earn it, it takes extremely longer than simply buying it.Exp is really slow unless useing exp potionsClass change quests are repeditive, Get me this, Kill this etc,Typical Korean GrindfestQuests are kind of touch and go, The wording is sometimes confusing.Understanding what you have to do gets hectic, but usually just make an party index and get some help.I will now explain the main classes Job Class/Sub Class* = Optional depending on what job you want to take Main line or Sub Class140 is the level requred to start the sub class quests.[Warrior Line]First optionWarrior 1-50>Warlord50-100>Dragoon100-140*/170>Hero170+  Subclass - (Highlander)Second option same classWarrior 1-50>Blader50-100>Strider100-140*/170>Blademaster170+  Subclass (Sword Dancer)[Knight Line]First OptionKnight 1-50>Templar50-100,HolyOrder100-140*/170,Savior170+  Subclass (Terror Knight)Second OptionKnight 1-50>Gaurdian50-100>Saint100-140*/170>Sefirot170+   Subclass (Psy-Kicker)[Wizard]First OptionWizard 1-50>Sorcerer50-100>Elemetal Master100-140*/170>Archmage170+ Subclass (PhantomMage)Second OptionWizard 1-50>Bard50-100>Ministrel100-140*/170>Popstar170+  Subclass (Maestro)[Explorer]First OptionExplorer1-50>TreasureHunter50-100>RuinWalker100-140*/170>WindStalker170+ Subclass (RougeMaster)Second OptionExplorer1-50 > Gunslinger50-100>Duelist100-140*/170>Der Freischutz170+  Subclass (Judgement)[Engineer]Engineer1-50>Meister50-100>Engistar100-140*/170>Swordian170+ Subclass (StarSeeker)Note: This class is recommended after you learn the basics of another class, as it has long cool downs and is slow grinding until Engistar/Starseeker.[Soul]Soul Breaker1-50>Soul Reaver50-100>Soul Lord100-170>Soulless One170+ Subclass [None]There is so current subclass for the Soul line as of now, but maybe in the future.Well this is my review and information atmIf you even need help and I'm online add me and privmsg meIGN's are : - Ganked - ImAStarSeeker - GooderThanYou - NumericalShout out to my fam Nikkalodeon or DirtyStrips if you need help pm him also tell him whats up he's cool <3			"

												  After around an hour's worth of play, La Tale puts a lot of interesting elements on the table, makes questing easy and in no way frusterating, has great music, and makes me sad that MegaMan Online was cancelled.  I'll continue.  La Tale is a 2D side-scrolling MMORPG by Actoz Soft, a rather unknown company.  The first aspect that La Tale does right is not losing the player's attention in the first five minutes.  Many MMO's start out with some lame backstory, a bunch of tutorials, and a year's worth of starter quests before you even get into the actual game.  La Tale gives you a tutorial, some quests, and throws you in.  No bull.  And I like that.  Gameplay is divided into combat and platforming.  Platforming isn't too difficult, but adds a much needed twist in the enviroments.  La Tale's UI is not a cluster-eff, and isn't confusing.  The art style is sweet, very anime-like, and I'm fine with that.  Controls will take getting used to, but there not too hard to learn.  The music in La Tale is amazingly good, it sounds like some of Capcom's retro tracks, and some of Sonic CD's lesser known hits, but also sounds like it's own style.  It is very rhythmic, and Ireally enjoyed listening to it.  At the end of the day, La Tale is a breakaway from the traditional MMO setup, and it's really good.  I'm sad that MegaMan Online was never created because of how great this game is.  Even if you can't into traditional MMO's, you should at least try this one.  It's a nice change of pace in a saturated market.			"

												I probably wouldv'e enjoyed this, if not for the god awful lag and awful mechanics. No one is able to play this game properly due to it. Control lag makes it very difficult to fight and navigate so during battle you just spam keys hoping that an attack will go through, and when jumping or climbing ladders and such, you have little control. Climb a rope or ladder, get to the top and you're floating above it and can't move, you have to go down and back up a few times and hope that it'll let you off. Aside from broken mechanics, this game has WAY too much detail. All you have to do is walk into the first city and you are assualted with such a cluster♥♥♥♥ of bright colors and other players cramming your screen, that it's hard to see anything. But from what I played, the upside is unlike other games like this one, it doesn't seem as dependent on the ""Pay For Convinience"" idea.			"

												Though I haven't played the game much, it is very interesting and very, VERY cute. Unlike MapleStory (GaypleStory in my case), La Tale shows that you can play an Anime orientated game and enjoy it WITHOUT having to pay a single cent for game progression (a.k.a. Elsword). The only problem: not Australian player friendly due to the lag. Seriously, if I move left, it takes 1.3 seconds for the game to show effect. Don't blame my internet, it's 40.5 Mbps. So until the server is fixed for us players who live in the down under, the game isn't recommended from my perspective.			"

												It's a fairly generic MMO, similar to games like MapleStory. Despite that, I find it a lot more fun than that. Unlike games like MapleStory, the progression is a bit more obvious. Therefore, you don't really have to pay much attention to the actual game to keep going, and can just do other things while mashing your number keys and going from quest giver to quest giver. I've spent over 100 hours in this game in under a week, and I don't feel burnt out about it. If you have free time up the wazoo, and can get lost in MMOs easily, go wild.7/10			"

												EDIT: They fixed the issue with the free gift, sending a code to Steam users. Still, it seems like it would be easier to download the game from OG instead of on Steam until they find a way to merge it together better.So anyways, changing this review to a do recommend.I like this game. It's a MMORPG that reminds me of Maple Story. The characters are cute, the story is interesting, and you get to destroy all sorts of adorable enemies.There are loads of events, and the community is big enough that it's not too difficult to find someone to play with. If you'd rather play alone, playing by youself isn't impossible either.However, I can't recommend this game on Steam. I joined this game not knowing that everything I do here is not compatible with their website. FOr example, the OG team sent me an email with some free gifts. Free gifts that I cannot have. Why? My account name is only for Steam, and doesn't link up to their website. I can create a new OG account, but that cannot be linked to my exisiting character, who is already has 10+ hours of work put into her.My only option would be to start over. I am not going to do that. It's a waste of time. So, all the email promotions I get will be useless. Oh, and I can't stop them either, because the account is linked to Steam, and not to OGs website. I can't login to OG at all.I recommend downloading this game from OG. It's free. Don't make the same mistake I did.			"

												I remember this. I played this game since it was originaly published by aeria games. La Tale is a side scrollong MMORPG where you see a tiny bit of backstory of a mysterious woman named Iris. After the optional cutscene you're taken to skippable tutorial with and a refference to the power rangers (The main villians are complete idiots BTW). The classes are the warrior(two handed sword and spears), the knight(one handed swords and clubs), the explorer(cross/bows and daggers), the wizard(staves), engineer(Breif case with large arttilery), and the SOUL BREAKER (monster souls). most classes uses knuckles(warrior,knight, explorer, and wizard)  and two classes uses daggers (explorers adn wizards). however the knight has a class theat specializes in knuckles. B4 the STORM update the requirement to go the next class is level 80 and now its level 50 in the desert. Most classes has 2 classes to play. Like the warrior you can pick the warlord but you'll still use swords and spears but if you choose the blader you can use twin blades. what I like about the game is the variety of classes there including the subclasses. The first 2 towns will be highly populated. my main issuses about La Tale is the deletion limit. once you hit 30 times you can't delete you character anymore. not unlees you're told to submit a ticket in order to rset it. I felt like a dumbass when I was told about it on facebook by the GM's themselves. This game isn't my favorite 2D sidescroller (its wonderking (youtube it). some maplestory may call it a ""clone"" but why the hell would I care. There is two communities who argue about the simmilarities i still don't care about it			"

												When I play this game, it's makes me feel more love towards Maplesea (South East Asia Server). Movement mechanisme is so lame. Why you put so much turn rate and delay for walking? Seriously? I press -> button and it takes around 0.8 secs to move. Not recommended for MapleStory player. And if you're never play maplestory, and wanted to try this game. Better don't. Go directly for Maplestory.			"

												great sidescrolling and platforming based-game! Though LaTale is not the best platform MMORPG, it still nice to be played with. also one of the non pay-to-win f2p games! you still eligible to continue your quest without buying costumes from the premium store. nice and cute graphic also one of the pros of this game.

												As a big fan of maplestory, I can say this game can be the spiritual successor to it. It has fantastic rpg elements with loads of options and stuff that can keep you busy for days (but i aint got no time for that anyway), this game is a must play. the fact that a free to play rpg is not a pay to win just keeps my day shining.+great gameplay+impressive pixel art+unique classes that change gameplay styles+alot of unnecessary but cool options (ex: a pet automatically picking items for you, enchanting your pet to give you permanent bonuses)however the only complaints i have are these two:-weird design descisions (for example, when you start the game it tells you to jump over a small area, it says ABOVE that small area how to jump, but i couldn't see that sign when i was still behind the rock.)-the game doesn't help you understand alot of things (for example, there is a stat called ""luck"" at the start of the game that changes based on your class, the game doesn't say the effects of that stat (the effect i didn't know was that luck increases money earned from monsters), another example is that i didn't know the difference between stamina (which i assumed was the SP bar), and magic (which i also assumed was the SP bar???). this is also a weird design descision.eitherway good or bad i highly recommend this game, as a free to play you should have nothing stopping you from trying this mmorpg out. this is my favorite 2D mmo and i am very impressed by its mechanics. though some things are stopping this game from being the best.8.5/10			"

												I think this game is very well balanced. No class is left out. All the ones they have, have equal stats. I only played a few classes and I loved them. La Tale is not popular, but it could be. You level up, earn more armor and you even make friends along the way. It could be a little tricky to figure out but once you figure everything out you relise that effort was worth it.			"

												Now I've played a few MMOs in my life and this isn't the worst. But it isn't the best. it's just sort of decent. I see the inspiration it took from Maplestory but even then that MMO only really appeals to a very niche audience, as does this game. Well let's get into the aspects of this game.The plot, and don't tell me ""Oh, it's an MMO plot doesn't matter"" because it does, Tera has a good plot and that's an MMO.  The plot is pretty basic, go here, help this npc to stop some big evil force and she's with you as a sort of Navi character. It's decent story but they actually give you the choice to skip the plot, which is a bad idea. I understand it's independently developed but I would rather a slightly mediocre voice over, over just text. And they put some of these text dumps right in the middle of enemy territory, which gets to be annoying.Now with the gameplay. It's repetitive. So it Tera's, but they at least constantly throw new abilities at you and get you to learn them. And each class plays drastically different from the next. You can pretty much put these classes into three categories. Melee Martial, Ranged Martial, and Magical. And each class within those categories plays the exact same. They advertise over 40 unique classes but they fail to produce much diversity in their gameplay. Not to mention that they just hand you weapons that are decently powerful, it isn't until the first boss that you get a more powerful weapon. The game pretty much holds your hand throughout the experience. I also had a lot of lag and even had the game crash on me during a transition. The only good thing I can say about the gameplay is the respawn function this game has, where you can either decide to respawn in town or in the field.The soundtrack is average. It's soothing, I guess that's a good thing.And now, onto the aesthetics. This game has the same chibi anime appeal that Maplestory has. While at the same time you have to play the game windowed in a decently small window, this makes the game itself harder on the eyes, at least for me, and once you get to Elias there are just too many people around and it was really a strain on my eyes to look at the surroundings. The enemies aren't threatening either, even Hyperdemension Neptunia had that problem but at the same time they did have some threatening boss enemies. Even the first boss in this game looks adorable.Age Rating: E for Cartoon ViolenceOverall Rating: 4/10So in the end I wouldn't suggest it for most of the gaming community, so it will not get a recommendation from me. Instead I'm going to recommend it to you if you enjoyed Maplestory or Gaia Online. I couldn't suggest this game to most of my friends so I won't recommend it here.			"

												Edit: (03/03/16) The latency has become a horrible problem and is starting to hinder the ability to play. I have played this game off and on for years now with long periods of down time. I loved the structure of the game, but the implementation of the way it all worked had always felt wrong or slightly off. Getting back into the game, things feel smoother and as they should be. Maps flow excellently now, quests are considerably easier to understand, leveling up is not a total chore right from the get-go, making money isn't an exhausting issue, many things seem to be in nice places with more proper labels. Compared to what the game is now, LaTale felt much, much more unorganized when I last played. The classes are still flashy and fun to play, and I see some skill animation changes have come around too which is really nice. (Warrior's heavy attack is not some clunky slow swing now)All in all, LaTale is getting to a point where it honestly should have been at a long time. But hey, better late than never. Give this game a shot if you enjoy(ed) Maplestory.Edit: Okay, I do see what other people mean about the translations being poor. They definitely need to be revised for proper English. It looks like some Asian kids with a terrible understanding of English wrote more than half of the scripts for the NPC's. One character even says something in a different language but spelled with English letters. That's just...massively stupid... I believe that's called Singlish? idk, needs to be fixed.			"

I say this because i highly dislike the fighting effects with the knuckls and the fact that i had no knowladge of them now handing out wepons through level up packages. I do not recommend this game if your an old player and wanting to come back but could possibly recomend it for thoes of them that arrived during the updates of early to late season 2 to early season 3...

												as a player of when la tale first came out i find the knight class enjoyable back then unlike compared to after all the updates. I say this because i highly dislike the fighting effects with the knuckls and the fact that i had no knowladge of them now handing out wepons through level up packages. I do not recommend this game if your an old player and wanting to come back but could possibly recomend it for thoes of them that arrived during the updates of early to late season 2 to early season 3...

												Considering my last review on this game was quite negative I decided to give the game a try again, and to my surprise I found myself enjoying it this time around. So here's my updated review. :)PROS:- Great game to play with friends- Cool bosses- Unique enemies for the most part (some enemies are re-skins)- Badass lootCONS:- Repititive after a whileWell anyways it's a great free game, but after seeing the same re-skined monsters and levels it does get repititive.My updated score, 7.5/10			"

												This is like a discount Maplestory. Except it's super slow. Not even at a fun level. 3/10 for effort.			"

												edit: ignore my play-time on here, I play the non-steam version and have over 5,000 hours of playtime.This game has one of the best communities of any MMO I've played, (I've beta-tested over 50 MMOs and played 30-50 others).The gameplay is smooth and the servers are pretty much lag-free.The combat is very action-based but not so much that you need fast reflexes (for most content anyway).The grinding speed has been gradually increased since release with the new end-game grind (lvl 200-220) being incredibly slow, not much content is locked behind lvl 201+ though, this gives more of a sense of value to the end-game lvls despite them not unlocking much.The cash shop is very fair, there are basically no items that give stats/advantages that aren't available (in bulk) through normal gameplay, the game economy generally allows players to easily get into buying and selling cash items for in-game money if they wanted to.The game doesn't appear dated despite being around 10 years old.9/10			"

												One of my first online MMORPG's that I've played, and a reminder that I will play anything I could get my hands on.The game has stuck with me, because I started playing at a young age and back then, I found myself a fan of RPG's and coming in new to the online world of La Tale, I couldn't help but give it a go. It's a fun, 2d side scroller game set in a cozy and adventurous world with generic RPG elements, and as much as I like it I have to say there's nothing really keeping me going, except for the usual grind and farm, rinse and repeat. I may not play it as much as I use to, but why not every now and then because-nostalgia. Aside from all that I had a fun filled experience with this game, and I would say take it out for a spin! "

												I've been playing this game on and off since 8th grade, I'm going to be graduating college in 6 months, for one thing, if the graphics appeal to you and you find your niche in the gameplay, I'd say this will enver make you bored. The only problem is a power creep the closer you get to endgame and it becomes more of a timesink than anything, I'd recommend it only because I like grindy games, which this doesn't really become grindy until pretty far into it.The game is no longer or can be considered P2W, since literally everything I can think of that one would need is buyable with in-game currency.
