												As a massive Spellforce fan, I was really looking forward to Faith in Destiny. However though it was fun to play, it left me a little disappointed. At a glance, everything about this game should mean I loved it. It was classic Spellforce. Except, it wasn't.Firstly, unlike the other incarnations of Spellforce, I could not create a female character, and there doesn't appear to be a reason for this (no male only references in the storyline etc). Secondly: It was short. So very, very short. I felt like the story had barely got going before it was over. The whole game feels like a demo for Demons of the Past, not a game in it's own right.And finally: The extra scenarios. After paying for a game that was almost insultingly short, I was offered 3 extra scenarios. For a fee of course. No thanks, I've forked over enough of my cash already. It breaks my heart, but unless it comes up on sale, I cannot recommend this game, and I think my journey with Spellforce ends here. I certainly won't be paying full price for the next one.  "

												SpellForce 2: Faith in Destiny is dated, but that's no surprise. What does surprise is the complete lack of imagination and at the same time a unique and seamless transition between RTS and hack and slash. What it does well, is offer a fun time for those with somewhat lower standards.SpellForce 2's unique mix of role-playing and real-time strategising makes a return in Faith in Destiny, but it only brings a few new tricks.However, even with those negative points and the fact that it doesn't add much to the series I still like Faith in Destiny. Despite showing its age at times the core game play is still entertaining and somewhat addictive.Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny isn't a bad game and if you are a fan of RPG and RTS you will like it.

												This game is actually not worth it's price. It has what made the Spellforce franchise great, but it's short and i'll risk to say that it has the worst story of all the Spellforce series, based on the cliche that you have to do everything ""because it's your destiny"". However, if you like Spellforce mechanics you can still find this game enjoyable, and if you like the single player free mode it will be worth it for you.Beware, however, that you won't be able to play with your friends if they own this game because the servers exist no more. You may try to find a way to play online with a program like hamachi, but I can guarantee that it won't be easy.Very average for the Spellforce series 57/100			"

												SpellForce 2 - Faith in Destiny is a sweet RTT/RTS-RPG game. Though I can't say I was fully satisfied by the whole of the experience but I really had fun playing it and its features nevertheless.GraphicsFor an expantion based on a 2007 game they are pretty cool. You get sweet nature designs, accurate animations, fire-lightning-smoke and other effects. Not too bad water material for lakes and seas. Legit logic of terain designing combined with natural effects colors and mood.The characters are also neatly done, you can see weapons and gear with enough details and light effects and you can even notice various cute details like smoke and sparks when gear hit against each other during fights.The engine is kinda like a sweet magor upgrade from what the old RTT/RTS games used to be.StoryNothing really extraordinarry. I haven't played any Spellforce games before so I had to do some homework in order to understand what was going on. The background of what's going on is pretty cool, however the game itself doesn't really give you a good story-telling sequence during the game and doesn't let you get too enthusiastic about it. Though there are a couple of dialogue and cut scenes that help the game stay in the avevare mood.CharactersNot much to say. The units are pretty pretty sweet and there's an appreciated quantity and quality of units.Heroes are nice too. Was happy to see some basic voice acting that helped me enjoy the game [though i eventually removed all acknowledgement effects cause i was a tinny bit irritaed of them due to playing with many clicks I guess :P ]GameplayIt was ok. All features were sweet with the exception that there's unfortunatelly a bad balance between RTS and RPG.Eventhough there are some good RPG ideas [gear upgrades, cool skills, skill tree etc etc] the averate taste in my mouth was that there was a bit more RTS than RPG going on.Also the game was kinda short. No not from the average gameplay point of view. It took me around 20 hours to do the cempaign while exploring every inch of the maps. However the story goes on through some very few basic sequences and after a few maps that's it, you are done with the campaign. And your only hope for more gameplay is skirmishing and downloading custom maps. I know the cost of adding more maps in the main campaign is too big compared to skirmish maps, but 2 or 3 more maps in the main story would make it feel a lot more satisfying!Music/SoundAverage neatly designed music additions with a bit of epic character. Nothing original.One thing though is that I REALLY loved that the developers never missed to concentrate on the details regarding sound effects. You can hear your units' footsteps or wingflapping while they move when you zoom close to them and not by an average generated effect but by individually generated sound.AverageIt's a cute game. Don't keep high expectations about it and you'll have enough fun.i'd say it's above 6 cause it keeps you happy but bellow 8 cause they could have added some extra material and a better balanceed RPG experienced so I say it's a 7/10 for me.PS: I got it on a special offer. I strongly suggest you grab a similar chance to buy this on a better price  ;)			"

												I really enjoy this game. The ability to grow your own hero like an RPG as well as play the game strategically like an RTS is what really drew me to this game. The first one was quite complicated and although it was a great game, I prefer the sequel due to it's simplifications and making the game much easier to just pick up and play for anyone. I love the free game mode where you are growing your own hero to whatever you please.I enjoy the two new playable races; however, the shaikan are abit overpowered with their ressurection ability and the nameless are abit underpowered with how they have not many buildings, but then each building is heavily necessary to build another thing before you can build it.I have also found a game crashing bug... if, for example, norton anti-virus does a pop-up saying your pc is secure, then the game crashes and says 'access violation'.another bug I have found is with hiring heroes in free game mode... if you hire more than one merc before you recieve the quest increase your honor, then you are glitched to keep having the gain a new companion quest.. and while you can't hire a new merc yet.. its a strange glitch..another glitch is found when talking to the dwarf in westguard... if you stand by the building and rotate your camera a certain way and then talk to the dwarf then you get glitched into the building... once glitched into the wall you cant move... and the only way to fix it is if you quit the game..Another thing... I have seen enemy troops just walk past mine and there was no conflict... they are not shadow units.. if the enemy units walk past a certain radius then they can bypass aggressing my units... unsure if this is a feature, but it seems abit too feeble of a feature.. multiple times has workers simply walked past my wall of troops only because they found a hole in which they can walk through.. and then they proceed to stealing my resources...Another feature I wish existed was that your workers can fight back... if the ai decides to build a stone build near my workers then one would think that the workers are able to fight back and attack the enemy workers or even destroy the build before it begins.. if not then when selected with a worker, dont give the option to attack when your cursor is hovering above an enemy unit/build ... if this is to dissuade a person from doing an all out worker attack with 80 workers and 80 slots worth of soldiers and 6 heroes then give the workers only the ability to defend themselves or only be able to attack other workers/resource buildings... make their ability to attack a special case only.. or just remove the option entirely.. small pet peeve of mine..I have yet to try the DLC of this game, but they seem mighty fun.. I bought the Complete Collection of this game, and I have been highly amazed by this game.. please fix the bugs..			"

												This is quite fun, though the campaign is very short; if they'd fleshed out the single player aspect I'd have no problem recommending this, as it is - the RTS/RPG cross is quite novel and I enjoyed this.It took me around 12 hours to finish the single player, and that wasn't hurrying.If you can get this for cheap, I'd give it a go.  At full price I'd definately give it a miss.			"

												Clocking in at 11 Hours, fair to say I´ve explored all nooks and crannies, but I am fairly disappointed, sadly the developers haven´t managed to capture the original Spellforce feeling which was still present within Spellforce 2 Shadow Wars and Dragon Storm. There was one mini game as far as I can remember everything else was just hack and Slash, go to a map build a base own everything due to the fact that your avatar (and the Dragon) kill everything on their own, leveling was too easy the army was a step ahead or on par in levels with the Nameless. Poor excuse, might change with DLC´s but I am not gonna buy any of them. My recommendation: Buy Spellforce Platinum and get some real RPG/RTS gaming done then compare it with this.			"

Oh my that was embarrasing.   Apparently I should go back and play the other Spellforce games and this was the one I should of left well alone.   I enjoyed the style of play here but oh wow that was the single worst ending to any video game I've ever played.  Even worse than Godzilla on the NES .....even worse than  (shudder) Mass Effect 3!!Don't waste your'e time here unless yuv'e finished Spellforce Gold and Spellforce 2.

												This is by no means worth your money unless it's heavily reduced.This game has 4 maps, all of which are very empty in terms of actual content and full of busy work and useless collectibles.You cannot play as a female avatar, apparently they somehow could not fathom that fans would want that and could not add the female voices later. And before anyone says, the protagonist is never even referred to by any other way than ""you"" and could easily be a woman.The voice acting is also very subpar, yes even for a Spellforce game.And last, the probably biggest complaint is the story and lore. Any semblance to the other games is just superficial at best. You have a few cameos. But everything seems like they just took some fanfic off the internet and made a game out of it. A lot of characters act, well, out of character, if they have any at all. Somehow they dig up an even greater evil than the Fial Darg and don't even characterise it, but apparently they've been around since forever and two days.This game is an empty shell. This is not the worst Spellforce game, that title might apply to another, but this is just not a Spellforce game at all, this is just a half-♥♥♥♥♥ mod. For 15 bucks.PS: the music is kinda nice, though.			"

												I really liked Spellforce and Spellforce 2, so when I started up Faith in Destiny I expected at the very least more of the same, if not an improvement on 2's single player campaign like what happened with Dragon Storm. Well...that's not what this is.Faith in Destiny feels like it was hastily cobbled together in a scenario editor with a month-long deadline for a finished product. The campaign has no voice acting and doesn't even bother with the illusion of choice like the previous campaigns did, instead just outright forcing you to play a male character. The campaign AI doesn't even pretend to play fair, instead spawning in units at set intervals because reasons, out-numbering you 10 to 1 and never actually doing anything but waiting for you to attack. Many map triggers and quests are broken, making the plot make even less sense than it would otherwise. You only find out why you're bothering to do any of what you're doing in the minute-long cut-scene after the final mission. As to the multiplayer (never one of this series' strong points, really), the new race (the Nameless) have their buildings, units and tech tree designed in a way that makes it obvious they're meant to be played only by a cheating AI, though if you're allowed to actually climb their ridiculously overpriced tech tree you'll end up with two titans and a host of overpowered units and towers that there's really no counter to in competent hands. The stand-alone scenarios are a little better in terms of both writing and gameplay (the AI doesn't cheat as hard), though broken scripts still abound, periodically making missions unwinnable because you climbed a hill from the left instead of the right.  All in all, don't bother with this, even if you liked the previous games, you'll just end up disappointed.			"

												I really,really hate myself right now that i am go with a negative review even that i am huge fan of series but i have to do it.After Spellforce 2, faith in destiny comes as a dlc to continue the story (in a manner of speaking).. The story takes place after the event's of first spellforce (although only 3-4 charcters and some landscapes are the same) soooooBeacause i dont want to spoil the game i will only write why i put thumbs down-Campain is too small (you can finish it in approximently 6-7 hours if you are fan of series or if you are new player it will go around 14-16 hours)-Objectives and main quest arent many-You must buy more DLC's inside of a DLC-Expansion ...-You dont have the luxurity of building a base (only in 2 missions you will have the privilage of doing so.....)-Too expencive for an expansion that needs other dlc -The ""Buy DLC"" button in main menu is a HUGE turn off-Music sometimes play and some others dont (so better go to youtube and type ""spellforce 2 faith in destiny OST""-Scenario leaves you with many questions-Few mearchent's whith even fewer goods to trade....-sometimes saved games glitch and the game forces to stop(the savegame stay corupt and if you dont have another save file you are screwed my friend)tip:if you take the quest in 2nd mission from dwarven smith dont get in trouble of searching for items or if you do use traveling stone to get back to ur's mountain, dont wait that the game will send you back there.... i was gathering all ingridience 1 by 1 but when i done the game FINISHED...... (even so the items are powerful but you most likely find others higher level and better than them while you go forward in campain)Spoiling alert for old timers!!!! this arent cons-you will come accross of Mosaic Of death -you will have to go to dwarf forge and play with fire -Nightsong is guest star and you aint gonna play with hersome other small things that you will see inside of gameThis is why i dont recomend it,its even more unfair that i bought spellforce 2 complete edition and still i got to pay for all dlc's .... I am really dissapointed as a fan of series, especialy beacause the whole game is ""take your hero and go killing horde's of enemys"" and even if i skip that fact,there are many things that make it ""avoid-able"" as game such as No base building (i dont know what developers had in mind) and PLUS that old game characters are not even interfere with the plot (exept some cut sceens)If i were you as a normal gamer i would suggest you buy spellforce 2 not this,never buy this as a stand alone gameAnd if you are fan of series and you want it desperatly i would recomend you to buy it in sales, not more than 5-6 euros "

												I 100% recommend this game for Spellforce fans. The nostalgia will be satisfied.For non-Spellforce fans, I recommend it only if you're curious and are okay with a few hours of simple role-playing (the first hours in the game) that will grow more and more as you go and end with a blast.Spellforce 2 is a blend of RPG and RTS. The old game played for over 50 hours, this one plays for 15-20 depending on your pace. You start with a level 1 Shaikan character and you get to choose, along the way, how you wanna build it as it levels up. The old Combat/Magic skill trees make a comeback and a new Shaikan tree appears. You also start with a Shaikan companion so that means you can choose how to build her as well. As I mentioned before, the game focuses on the RPG aspect at the beginning. It starts slow, since you have little skills and basic af leather armor, but you also level up quickly. After a few hours you'll be level 10 already, which means you get to have a few of the cool spells, and start facing tougher challenges. Those hours might be a slight let-down for few but the rest of the game more than compensates for them. The game focuses more on the RTS aspect in the second half. It is not easy, but it is great. The story is connected to Spellforce 2. It's a follow up. Several of the old game's characters make an appearance (one even joins your party for a while like Nightsong did) and the feats you performed in the original game are mentioned (which is great for nostalgic fans like me). Two new factions are included in Faith in Destiny (for a total of 5-6) and I felt satisfied with them. But the best addition to this game when compared to Shadow Wars was the item sets (besides the autosave function). If you complete the sets you get added bonuses (some of them boring ones like +100 health, other ones fun like 25% heal when killing). There are lots of sets for every character class.This game might be a little rough around the edges in a couple of aspects but it is still a good one. If you really buy this game, just two tiny advices: first, don't make your first companion an archer; you get one later in the game. Nothing wrong with having two archers, since you can specialize them later, but I think you'd like to have a wider pool of magic spells in your party. And second, I've added a couple of guides related to loot and weapons that might help you out.In the end, I wanna thank the devs for this satisfactory experience as an old Spellforce fan. "

												A disappointment. The game is too short, the plot is missing a lot of information. Once things start to get interesting, the game is done.Mecanics are uncomfortable. There are ridiculous thing with the controls such as – right click tells the character where to move, long right click while moving the mouse will move the camera. Half the time, you're making a wrong move, because no one thought about the controls. Avoid if you can. "

												I must admit I did enjoy Faith in Destiny. I played all previous Spellforce games and it was a very long time since I played the last one, so it was rather nice to play again.That said, Faith in Destiny is very poor. It's short (4 maps), there really isn't anything new and the story is the poorest ever seen in a Spellforce game.

												A bit of a let-down compared to other Spellforce entries.  While this one is more difficult than Dragon Wars and the core game, the campaign is EXTREMELY short.  This iteration also introduces scenarios; which are paid DLC maps for little snippets of story and gameplay.  Fun... but probably should have been included in the core game.  While I do recommend the game for those looking to continue through the Spellforce storyline... I would probably wait until it is on sale.  This truly does feel like a ""primer"" for the next expansion.A few postives though:- Better camera control.  No longer have to use the console to fix FOV- ""Very difficult"" difficulty setting is actually somewhat tough compared to that of prior releases.  Finally a challenge- Story is good, albiet very short.			"

												It is a good dlc to Spellforce 2, not great but good. It isn't so short - it takes me 18 hours to finished it what was longer than many dlc's to new games. The storyline is not bad, characters are quite good - the real trouble with them are sometimes embarrasing dialogue lines which don't exacly suit same npc (Caine for example). Graphic remember time of Spellforce 2 which isn't great, music on the other hand is fine. Of course dlc is far away from greatness of Dragon Storm but that's propably is caused by changing of studio. Faith in Destiny is quite challenging - it isn't so easy as it looks, and same storyline have some potential in it, also if somebody wish to play in next dlc (""Demons of the Past"") it is good to know Faith in Destiny first - without it you can loose some important information from storyline. I can advice this dlc to everyone who loved Spellforce serie - Faith in Destiny represents almost all what was good in this serie - even if it doesn't add anything new (besides new kind of enemy) to it but it's a very good reminder.

												No! Keep away.The game mechanic itself isnt bad, but spellforce 2 is lame, from voice acting to a stupid ""trust in yourself tale"" haha.Ok, isnt THAT bad, i have seen worse, but the game is so...mediocre, that you get bored to play. Usually bad games with good tales hold you(even if you are suffering playing) just to see how the tale ends, but after 6h and 40% of game completion i simple gave up. Bad. 4.5 of 10 this RTS is really bad except for its concept art-style.			"

												I bought universe edition game story is good, playing time is long that is definitely good, it is not ending in hours, but I have never able to finish any game. Because after some point when map is changing in every game (fist game platinium, second game gold edition, faith in destiny - demons past not played yet) I got ACCES VİOLATİON ERROR that is annoying. I cant see any work the correct that bug and steam must take the responsibiliy or nordic games becasue when after played hours , for the one bug games not ending that very annoying			"

												This and Spellforce one are the BEST of the game series, and even better you don't need to have had played previous ones to understand the story! I DEFINANTLY recommend this for those RTS players and RPG players, for it is a a Good mix of both done perfectly.			"

TL;DRIf you like a challenge, you probably won't like this.Full VersionThis game threw me for a loop.  At first, I found it discouragingly difficult.  But this was because I had played Spellforce, and this game plays significantly differently.Once I learned the quirks of the new game, I found this game quite enjoyable.  The main differences between the two lay in how you grow your army and how strong your units are as opposed to your towers.Spellforce, for me, always turned in to a tower defense game.  I found I could build towers to destroy incoming waves of enemies before they got close to my base.  In many instances, it was actually best to create a line of towers going through the maps in order to get close enough to enemy bases so I could send in an army to destroy them.  But more often than not, I could actually just build my towers right through enemy bases, then mine them for experience.They nerfed the towers in Spellforce 2, and while I imagine it's possible to continue using them in this way, they seem to cost much more than they did before.  It seems unlikely a person could use them in this way in this game.There are new mounted units, and you get all the racial units by upgrading your headquarters.  You can also build a new headquarters.  While I never completed Spellforce (it took an awful long time to build towers everywhere) I do not recall being able to build headquarters buildings.There appear to be other quirks, too, regarding the handling of heroes.  There appear to be no rune monuments, and your heroes are not called ""rune warriors,"" which, I suppose, could make sense.  But it may just be a matter of nit-pickery that I notice these things.  Besides, aside from the name change, and that your compinions without having to summon them, your heroes seem to be nearly identical to the rune warriors from the first game.Aside from a number of side challenges, the game plays pretty much the same in RTS mode:  Build headquarters, build at least two of each resource miner (provided you can find the resources themselves), upgrade the headquarters to produce mounted crossbowmen, build farms, build mounted crossbowmen, have the mounted crossbowmen stand guard or march on small patrols until you can finish your headquarters and build what you need to get the mage unit, and, once you can do that, build a titan, one mage unit, and then storm the rest of the map.The mage unit is more for intelligence gathering.  Able to go anywhere, I found the mage unit pretty routinely died if it was ever used in combat.  The mounted archers pretty universally could take on any target.  But I have only just started playing the game, so the usefulness of the mages (magi?) could change in later game play.Perhaps the winning strategy will also change in later game play, too.  I do not yet know.There are skill trees, which I've not fully explored yet.  But I have noticed that, for at least the first six levels, the game forces you to spend your skill tree points in two different, almost opposing, skill trees.  If you can specialize more after that, I haven't yet discovered.  I suppose I could spend the time counting all the skill points you can spend and compare them to all the ""spent point"" requirements, but at present, I'm simply too lazy to do so.The new mounted units seem, thus far, grotesquely OP, but that's a large part of why I enjoy the game.  I don't enjoy games that don't make me feel powerful, and this game certainly does that!  So if you're a fan of extremely challenging games, and especially rogue-likes, you probably won't enjoy this one at all.			"

												The weakest Spellforce game of the series in my opinion, Faith in Destiny has all that made Spellforce 2 a good game but with few changes to the original game,The game should be an expansion for Spellforce 2 instead of a stand-alone game. The story was nothing special compared to Shadow Wars and Dragon Storm, although the new nameless invasion and their relation with your avatar was well done, the game lacks a variety of maps in the campaign, so the campaign even if it is entertaining, was a bit shorter than expected for a Spellforce game. They could have done a lot with the Nameless invasion, perhaps giving you the role of liberator as you help the other nations against the Nameless. The gameplay was basically the same as Spellforce 2, but since I loved that game, I don’t find the gameplay to be a problem. The existing nations and armies you play with keep you interested, even if they did add the Nameless in Skirmish, free and Domination modes, you don’t get to play with them in the campaign. Your avatar now has a few new abilities but nothing that changes the way you played in Shadow Wars or Dragon Storm.The music never disappoints in a Spellforce game, they added a few new ones but the classics remain. The graphics are still the same as Spellforce 2, with higher resolutions but that’s no problem since these are some of the best looking graphics in the RTS/RPG genre, in my opinion.Overall, it was a good game but I was a bit disappointed with Faith in Destiny because of its short campaign and very few additions to the game, they should have just made it into a expansion like the Dragon Storm campaign instead of a stand-alone game.

												As a spellforce fan, i do not recomend dishing out $20 for this game, the reason is: It is only 5 maps long. This is coming from a franchise where games had close to 20 maps of 2 to 4 hours each.Granted the game is much more lighthearted than the infuriating hellishly difficult of its predecessors, and i kindof appreciate this, but the story makes very little sense in its own, much less when put against the previous titles. Just as when i started getting the hand of the story and understanding my role in it (just by a little bit, because it is still confusing), well the game ended; it feels more like a prelude to something else, like an Act I of a game than a whole game in itself.I recomend only getting this game when heavily discounted, otherwise you are not missing much.

												If you can stomach the horrible dialog and story it's actually pretty good. It took me 10 hours to play through and has 5 maps, so you should get this in sale. Don't buy the DLCs however, I could not finish a single one due to major bugs.			"

												Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny is a great game, especially with the addition of Free Mode which allows for many extra hours of gameplay.  While the campaign is not perfect, this is because a different company took over the game.  It is still quite fun and very much worth playing.  I enjoyed it greatly! <3			"
